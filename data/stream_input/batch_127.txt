B00JGBFHK2|5|Love my plate!!
B000CO788G|5|Cables fit perfectly on my 1996 Chevy S-10. I drilled out the existing rivet and then popped it off with a flat head screwdriver and a hammer. Did have to disassemble the tailgate handle because it is all an assembly. All in all, it probably took less than an hour to replace both cables.
B000JFJLP6|4|It has exactly what it states POWER.  Reliable powerful power.<br /><br />My purchase is a classic example of not reading all of the product description: for the price- over $125- I thought I was getting something multipurpose all-in-one over the top and loaded with more than the rest of other jumpers out there PLUS getting the 12 volts with 1700 amps that my vehicle needed. Nope. It was my erroneous assumption that I would get more bells and whistles on my jumper-gadget. Nevertheless, I did get a solid unit that is powerful enough to jump a GMC Savana 3500 van.<br /><br />Repeating what others stated in the reviews before me: If you want who-dizzles and what-nots such as an LED light, usb slots, air compressor, hand crank generator charging station, welder, hair dryer, satellite TV, mini fridge, microwave, etc. then keep searching for another jumper device.<br /><br />This device is barren of the bells and whistles.<br /><br />However, as others have mentioned the Clore Jump 'N Carry is meant for immediate jump start 12 volt 1700 Amps POWER when you need it to power-up (a larger SUV, van, small truck). It holds the charge solid for months. The instructions advise to recharge every 90 Days just to keep the battery longevity fresh.<br /><br />It does what it should if you know what you are doing. If someone is unknowing, that someone can get hurt and cause damage.<br />It is not for the “What side goes to what?”,  “How do I pop the hood of the car”, “The dealership/mechanic takes care of all my automobile maintenance stuff” people out there. There are better (read: safer and more user friendly) jumper starter devices out there for those people.<br /><br />My complaint is: Why is it so large, bulky and top heavy with a exposed hot contact (with no safety covers just waiting to make contact and ZAP! when not intended or not in use)?<br /><br />Just before posting this review, I reread the manufacturer's product description Jump ‘ N Carry JNC 660  is meant for Industry or Professional starting environments automotive service shops, fleet service, car dealerships, auto auctions, marinas, and more. When I purchased the Jump ' N Carry in January I guess I missed those points but now I understand that this device is best suited for stable surfaces and not best for transporting around in a metal trunk or back of a truck.<br /><br />However, for my needs, it stays in the van, because you never know when it’ll be needed. Since it is top heavy and with an exposed live/hot positive contact- and Savana van interior is exposed metal-I keep it in the upright position.  It is secured in between 2 heavy objects- ensuring the live contact won’t bump into anything metal (because of the positive charger clamp is exposed).<br /><br />Jump ‘n Carry should offer a safety cap or covering for the hot charge clamp or even a switch to control the power when not in use. (Maybe?)<br /><br />I recommend this, but remember it is not for everyone or every automobile.

B00RW294CO|5|I loved it but I wished I would have got it! I haven't received it yet.
B007FHHEVO|5|awesome gauge. instructions are perfect  cheap gauge worth every penny. I have it on my twin turbo duramax at 50 psi pounds
B007IPKUPU|1|Not a very strong battery even when fully charged
B0007RDVH0|1|Used today for the first time on my Jeep Wrangler. At first I thought it was working because when it starts to foam you can see the suds pull the brown stuff to the surface... When it dried my tires were stained brown (rust color)! I would go away from this if you are cleaning tires. Wheels... It works just Ok.
B007V90D3M|3|They were OK
B000IY4A0Y|5|Great rotors!  I will buy these again.
B00KL3ALGO|5|Very happy with my purchase! Exactly what I was looking for!
B004CZJO3I|5|Great sell!  It was everything I needed to charge my electronics in the car.  My laptop does well on this as long as my van is running.  Very satisfied!
B000OAXP4E|5|I replaced my 15&#34; long, straight cut, double wall, tip with this 12&#34;, angle cut, double wall tip and love the results. Looks great on my Chevy 2500. Easy to install and quality craftsmanship.
B009EABGB4|5|looks, fits and works great, but the very edged of mirror glass seem a bit distorted and not a flat as the original morror.
B000GTV6Z8|5|Works great.  No longer have battery issues with my motorcycle.
B00KE991ZW|5|Will be ordering more! 😎
B000CKCY98|4|Well built product...works fine...no disappointments
B001LQOSX2|5|Very nice looking.  Hope it holds up to the weather
B006PASA9M|2|This is the second set I've gotten and neither color matches, even though I got color from car info.. The colors are just off and don't match. :(
B00UO6GM48|5|Product was good
B008T4YOSS|5|actually a big on the big side but great value
B001B4ROD0|5|One of my older shades broke and i ordered this one and it matched perfectly with the older set that is already on my car. The set up was simple and quick. The alcohol pads that were provided helped get any remaining residue off the car. My only complaint is that it has the brand logo on the shade in white so it stands out. My older ones do not have this.
B000BZWW4Q|5|Done well
B00RW3ED1K|5|Perfect fit for 2008 shadow spirit.
B00HEZKD56|1|this stuff looks great going on but doesn't dry, it remain tacky. can't wait till it wears off so i can try something else.SO DISAPPOINTED.
B00BITQPSI|4|is my second one for my mini van there plastic i wish they can make of metal ones
B00L3MBWII|5|Good quality and a reasonable price.
B0007TFL6W|5|Perfect fit, look great and easy to clean. These should be an OEM option from car manufacturers!
B003VDX5D2|5|Came exactly as described, installation was easy, very stable going up and down ladder. If I had another truck I would buy another!!! GREAT PRICE FOR THIS TAILGATE LADDER!!!
B00KWQRC4O|4|I like the convenience of this. The tissues fit weird and don't pull out well. Other than that, it's a pretty handy product.
B00HKY8ZE2|5|The color is great and so far, it is working nice and bright.  I ordered the HIDs with L socket shape and it fits perfectly.
B00W45H2R8|5|LOVE
B00GSAUHB8|5|Very easy to put up and take down. Folds up to a compact size and fits my Fit well.
B000COMX18|5|Great quality and now adds security to my wheels, does not work with aftermarket wheels only oem
B00DMEFH7W|4|Shopping for seat covers suck. Finding a 'universal' seat cover that isn't godly expensive and will fit your 'no-so-universal' vehicle is hard. I purchased these because of A. Price and B. Look and C. Because they said Universal.<br /><br />First of all - these seat covers WORK and look good and fit Mostly Well.<br /><br />Second I'll go through my experiences installing these.<br />1. My pickup has bucket seats in the front with a non-removable headrest. However, the main seat cover just slides over the set and headrest. This could pose a problem to someone who constantly adjusts their headrest. I leave mine in one spot so that isn't an issue.<br />2. The straps and hooks that they use to make sure the seat cover stay in place seems sketchy, but really it works very well. I have had Zero issues with the seat cover moving.<br />3. Back seat - This was a little more difficult and not as simple or as universal. My back seat is a split - so 2/3 of the seat lifts up and then 1/3 lifts up, so I can have one person sit back there or just 2, or all 3 if all of the seat is down. With the seat cover, you have one option all down, or all up. This could be a problem for people who like to haul things and still have someone ride back there.<br />4 - Back seat seat belts and drinks - I had to cut a hole for the seat belt latches, this wasn't a problem. Like the description says you can cut it and it won't ravel or get bigger. The drink holder in my back seat of my pickup is in the seat. This is now covered up. Thankfully I have cup holders on my doors so I didn't worry too much about losing the two in the middle.<br />5. Ease of Installation - in order to completely latch everything together it takes a little wiggling around and maneuvering the straps to get them behind the seat, under the seat. So make sure whomever is installing these it somewhat capable of moving around.<br /><br />All-in-all...these seat covers do their job. They protect the seat and look good.
B00S209B2I|5|It's cute and manly... haha. I am not sure about the quality though. Keys get tossed around and banged up in general so my only concern is that the charms may fall off over time. Keep an eye on the little charm rings.
B00Y4GY6Z6|5|This decal was a very nice fit for my charger.  Thank you again.
B00P07EE82|5|Solid product.  Installed easily, and does what it is supposed to do.<br /><br />On a 2014 - 1500 - Z71 with 275/70R18, it raises the front just enough to provide the needed clearance (removed air-dam) but allows me to tow a boat without sagging the back end.  Looks good, to boot.<br /><br />FYI: The image only shows the top of the block.  The underside it hollow, so it is pretty light weight.  Very sturdy though.
B000C53XRK|4|great
B004K2FSXI|5|Used this weekend, super accurate and super high quality.
B004GC9NF6|4|Would be excellent if it had the screw-holders.
B00QEC0ANA|5|Very nice quality and easy installation.
B009NOZ4RI|5|So far the product works as expected.
B006X8BATI|5|fills in that empty space in the lower grill of the truck perfectly
B00UJ9BPC4|4|I love it! The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it was a little hard to put on. I was scared it was about to rip. But it didn't! And it's not &#34;hot pink&#34;, more of magenta color. Besides that, it was a great buy and I absolutely love it!!!
B00L4DN5CW|1|Purchased for an F-150, remote and transponder programmed with no issues. Visually it appears to be better quality than some of the ford fusion style keys being sold on Amazon which can also be used with multiple Ford vehicles using PATS. The negative is that the remote range is terrible. I have to be less than 10 feet from the truck before it works.  *UPDATE* The unlock button now only works half the time. I tried replacing the battery, but that did not help. I finally gave up on this key and have switched back to original Ford separate key and remote. I got tired of pressing the buttons 10 times before the truck would unlock!
B000BZJ7DU|1|Bosch junk, should've bought a Denso.  The product failed within 2 weeks, but outside my 30 day return window.
B007L5CZFA|4|Total satisfaction!<br />My twin 4yr olds love them. The helmets are very light and fit great.<br />Awesome bang for your buck right here.
B00JM0CG7Y|5|I love it, perfect for my Ford Edge
B00JT4HB14|5|Slightly less dark black but fit is better than OEM, finish is excellent & the Jaguar added matches the steering wheel logo. I recommend.
B00HJ6O4A0|4|Very Handy!
B002W8KU6W|5|This plug worked perfectly in my 2005 R1200GS in all 4 locations.  The iridium ones I had tried did not!  Bike ran like crap with the other ones I tried.  These saved the day!
B003ZWHW1K|4|It came in on time and worked properly.
B001THP1UC|5|Great Headlights.  Made my car look like I just drove it off the show room floor even though my car is 6 years old.  Couldn't be happier.
B00H1AQOWA|5|Exactly what I expected.  Used on my nextbook.  Perfect size and great quality.
B000KZ1U3Q|5|This keyless remote worked great and it was easily programmed.  I am so very pleased.  It was very reasonably priced also.  I thought that it would<br />be difficult for me to program but it was very simple.  I would have ordered it much sooner had I known that.
B009GKHXBO|5|Control arm went on easy as pie...good fit
B00480N0SC|4|Meh brighter than stock but that's about it.
B001U8UUWE|2|They look cheap
B00IH22RDG|5|Great fit. Love it.
B005RNGL9O|5|Great Stuff, I didn't know but this is only 1 single sheet.  Not cheap, but I didn't need a ton.  I lightly wet sanded some scratches from my car with no training and then buffed with compound using 3k and 5k grit.  They came out perfectly!
B00SLKS8WI|5|The only item that needs changing is to use black nuts and bolts. The Silver nuts and bolts just don't look good on black boards.
B004M224EW|5|best car wash on the market!
B00INZ65B2|5|Worked  well, no issues
B007XZK7F8|5|Great
B00BUMRJ1U|5|Fits perfectly on my 5 year old's head. It may be a bit bigger than its supposed to be, but overall it fits him with a little room to grow. (He is 95% in height and weight, so keep that in mind when reading this review). My son loves the color purple and its hard to find things that are &#34;manly&#34; and purple, but this is a great blend of old-school style and colors that work just for him. Overall seems like a really great product for the price and something we can pass down to his brother.
B001A1PPBM|4|As described
B000O51VJ0|4|Rather sturdy little can!<br />Decent amount of heat.<br />Missed the part in the description where the need of a conversion piece (separately purchased) for the 1lb propane bottles.<br /><br />If I had to do it over, I would have purchased the Big Red Campfire in a can.
B000BZJE9C|5|Works great and works with 2003 BMW 325i.
B00JU65OP6|5|satisfied
B006QQGBHS|2|really light compares to the original tailgate handle. Noticeably cheaper and doesn't seem durable
B0050C7VXM|1|It needs to be at least two feet longer. When I test hooked my &#34;toad&#34; to my motorhome, there was took much tension and the connection was lost.
B009KBUR2Q|1|Product is horrible and does not clean your windows without streaks....Would NOT recommend!
B00OOY12EQ|3|Quite expensive! But don't buy the cheap one !!
B001UFQBAM|5|Perfect also the price is right !!
B00CHD6QXI|5|Very nice quality and everything fit ! The only question is  how long will it last ?
B0002SA4II|5|Great!
B001O7PNS2|5|Wow is all I can say.  I had some paint transfer from scraping the garage wall, used the scratch X then this and the spot looks better than the rest of the car.  Seems expensive but its worth the money.  Very easy spray on, wipes off clean in just a few seconds.
B003XVGB74|5|Simple installation. Wilwood makes quality stuff.
B00M4J27U6|2|Positives: fits 2015 suburban well; protects interior mat from wear & tear;<br />Negatives: slightly thinner and softer than expected for price- causes mat to move around - our stroller doesn't slide easily on the mat and the mat moves around when we push the stroller into the back; the mat I received had a white Chevy emblem that looks cheap - not Chevy gold;
B000BUU5XQ|5|These are just what we needed for our Travel Trailer.
B00004Y61N|4|Fits perfect on my 97 Dodge Ram 2500.  Only issue was I had to re-tighten one the the Anchors.  This was probably the result of tie-down high shear loads, and not seated properly during installation.
B00L8KU5Y2|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B001NYJOCC|5|Excellent. Cleared a major noise caused by the old one going bad
B0007LL0CO|5|Excellant quality. Met the product description. Shipped as described and arrived timely n
B007XE8C74|4|Works great. Love the readiness cues
B008A5Y0HG|5|This remote match the original and so easy to set up.
B00029WVHO|5|The best thx
B00J9VJPL6|4|good deal worth the money
B001F2I7SE|5|easy install and works great
B00AO6I5XY|5|Very good fit, and light weight. Quick release chin strap works well.
B0000AY3X0|5|Much better than a real chamois
B00R91OOJ6|5|It was pretty easy to install and still sticking on so good so far.
B002BELP3Y|3|It's ok. I was looking for something that doesnt have too much bend and that isnt too rigid...but I feel like this has a bit too much flex in it.
B00C97538G|5|I chose these wheel covers (hubcaps) for two reasons. First and foremost, they are the only covers I could find that have a good balance between style and covering most of the wheel. The only reason to have covers is to cover up the inevitable rusting of the steel wheels. Secondly, not only does the mat black look cool, but it allows the black zip tie that I put on the edges nearly impossible to see. I have had trouble with hubcap theft in the past.<br /><br />If you have 14 inch wheels on a car that is not quite nice enough to justify new alloy rims, than these are a a great style/cost computerize.
B002PWJRWS|5|Sturdy stool.
B00ID94XCG|5|Awesome
B000P79C2U|5|Very nice quality! This is the same one that I could have bought from my local MINI dealership for much more money!
B008H3YIV4|5|Part turned up as promised, worked great
B0028JQYPG|5|good quality, as expected
B00316K61S|4|Awesome
B00ZYYEHF6|5|It is well made. Used it to balance 2 props( very little adjustment had to be made). Easy to use.
B0093E8SRG|5|Quick easy install, great inexpensive product.
B0093A9JEG|5|Perfect fit! Really keeps the temperature down.
B000GQA8DC|4|Fits OK in my 2005 Ford Ranger Pickup Truck, although it does hang over the edge of the seat a tad.  Just make sure you tighten it up as well as you can with the middle seat belt.
B001NYYREC|5|Great product super fast shipping great price.  Will buy from again!
B008WH4PPY|1|One is warped with about one month of use, 2000 miles.  Disappointed.
9539751047|5|Exactly what I wanted. Delivered in a very timely manner.
B002OUMVWY|5|SO SO SO much better than the flexible sewer hoses.  I LOVE that this snaps when its connected and is so versatile.  Draining the holding tanks is a crappy job already, so why not give yourself the best chances to not hate the dirty job.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B00829I2VU|5|Good performance. Much better quality than original pump.
B009EQKC5Y|5|Same as description thank you
B00XAX4B9A|5|It is a bizarre little thing that unfolds into a lightweight shade that is wide enough to cover the windshield in my Suburu Forester.  It is tall enough that the right and left window shades hold it in place at the top when they are folded down.  And, the bottom fits snugly against the glass and the top of the dashboard.The silver reflective side fits against the window and the black side faces the back of the car.  It is dynamite!  It is lightweight and can be folded back up to fit in its small carry pack.  It definitely keeps the dash and the steering wheel cool when the car is facing the sun.  It was a gift to me from Tony P<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XAX4B9A?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_0
B00L22F2E4|5|Works great, just what I needed.  They stay on and protect as advertised.
B000F14CPS|2|For my 1999 B3500 standard van, after returning a cover once, I was again sent one that was nowhere close to fitting.  Too small and the holes were in the wrong places.  It was for some other vehicle.  The one in the picture looks like it would fit, but that is not what I was sent, twice.
B000M5Y72A|5|Good
B0019O1BS6|5|Perfect fit.
B008AX9AJG|5|Great price great tool
B005BNP7YU|5|Totally awesome hitch cover & light!!!
B001D566IG|5|excellent price ,Great for regular  replacement  after off-roading , desert dust really builds up on the trail. between sand and silt you'll be replacing a lot
B000066OC7|2|Much thinner than the image. Guess I can use it in the car.
B001B7TSSQ|5|Just what I needed. Real easy to get at and not have to climb in the truck.
B00I0ZXV5S|5|Makes life so much easier.  No twisting and turning to fit the seat belt into the receptacle.  My husband says he thanks he every time he us fastens the seat belt
B000C7QJJW|5|works as advertised
B004RNR9BY|5|Good hose, cheapest price
B003D4I89U|1|Did not work for me. Did not resonate. To make matters worse it was stolen.It could have worked as an ornament. Shucks.
B008MHJWM0|5|Excelent
B001Q4XIHG|5|. Put it on Kawasaki bayou with no trouble at all. Holds guns firmly in place
B007LQHJNM|5|Worked perfect and Fast delivery
B010J85NU4|5|Love it!!!
B000C42SDQ|5|On time and perfect fit.
B004K296N6|4|Works pretty good for my 33&#34; tires. I have it mounted under hood and hose included is long enough to reach all tires in my wrangler tj. Not sure why but mine didn't come with air filter
B000Z0HVHA|4|Works well!
B007HRJNIE|5|Since we bought our camper last year, we've turned heads every time we've entered a campground. But for all the wrong reasons.<br /><br />Our Equal-i-zer hitch popped, creaked, and groaned every time we hit a bump or made a sharp turn. As we drove through the campground to our site, everyone we passed stopped what they were doing to see what was causing all the noise.<br /><br />My initial research (both online and in talking to other campers) implied that the noise is normal, and is a by-product of the weight-distribution and sway control features of the Equal-i-zer hitch. But all that noise sounded anything but normal, so I kept looking for a solution to this noisy problem.<br /><br />Finally I found mention of the Equal-i-zer Sway Bracket Jackets. These fit over the brackets where the sway tension bars rest. The friction of the sway tension bars against the bracket helps reduce sway as you are towing your trailer. Before installing the jackets, the friction was metal on metal, so this produced a lot of the noise I was hearing.<br /><br />After installing the jackets, the friction is now metal on nylon, which is much quieter. When towing with the jackets installed, I noticed absolutely no reduction in sway control. The only thing I noticed is that towing my camper is now a much, much quieter experience! This past weekend when we drove through the campground, no one even noticed we were there.<br /><br />Unfortunately I can't in all honesty give full credit to the Sway Bracket Jackets for quieting my hitch. I also purchased Equal-i-zer's hitch lubricant, and applied that to the ball, hitch head, and tops and bottoms of the sway tension bar sockets. While I'm sure that the bracket jackets alone will reduce the noise your hitch may be making, I don't think they will eliminate all the pops and creaks. You'll need the lubricant as well.<br /><br />However, I still consider this a great product and a great purchase, and I would without hesitation buy them again if needed.
B00RC82682|5|Probably the best stick-on visors on the market, and half the OEM price. Come with stainless steel clips for better grip, but not necessary IMO. Also fit Impreza if you don't mind XV molded into the rear door visors.<br />Install instructions from YouTube on their website.
B000RW1XCK|5|We had a leak in the windshield of our motorhome.  We utilized this Urethane Windshield by 3M and we have not had any leaks yet and we did it ourselves.  Fantastic sticky magic!
B00659K35C|5|great get compliments all the time
B00XOSZY1A|4|Nice color, nice armour, but snug fit and lower body straps are too small, seems like it's from a smaller size jacket. But diffently a nice armour.
B001URKV0G|5|Worked as expected, arrived early
B00F5MCL14|3|The Chemical Guys Foam Blaster is not all that it's hyped up to be.<br />It doesn't have much pressure behind it (because it's from a hose, which is what I was expecting)<br />There's many plastic parts, I've seen ones with metal parts that are cheaper and would last longer. (Just doesn't have the Chemical Guys' name)<br /><br />Mine also has a leak where the hose connects, it's a very minor leak but still a leak nonetheless.<br /><br />Now the good:<br />It will be good for UPKEEP of your vehicle (not enough pressure to get bird poo/mud/etc)<br />Brass connections (which the metal ones I was talking about has)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I'm not happy I paid $50, I was honestly expecting more from it but it feels so flimsy. I would not order this product again.
B0036TWDLQ|4|This is a really nice cooler box! Unfortunately it does not fit my 2013 Rzr 900 XP. Well, it might but you would have to completely remove the inside bed liner as it is a one piece unit. But then dust could would likely come in from behind the seats. Or possibly use a Sawsall and cut off the side rails. Sadly returned it. Also, the pic on the ad shows one in a Kawasaki and the shape of the sides on the Rzr box is different.
B00OSZ2N08|5|Replaced an old shallow PIA garbage receptical with this one, which also has side pockets, but is deeper and doesn't have the useless tissue holder like my previous. Experimenting with placing around the center console so that it is more easily accessible to both driver and passenger. It does block the rear passenger vents in my VW sportwagen but I never have rear seat passengers so it seems to work pretty well. Svelte profile and pleasant brown to go with my new car's beige interior (instead of the omnipresent black). Looks like a quality bag, with what appears to be a waterproof/resistant liner that seems pretty beefy for any gooshy debris. Looks way classier than the othe black bags I've had and rests on the center divide of the rear passenger area (per another reviewer). Good idea. I like it so far. Shipping was super fast. Doesn't close as snappily as the others' but it really doesn't need to, since it &#34;gapes&#34; less due to its narrower profile.
B003SYQH8O|5|Had to replace driver side lens on 1996 ford crown vic,this part fit and looks good.
B007SIW316|5|Received it really quick. Exactly as described, fit great.
B0009IQZSY|5|good
B003VWNE0C|1|Not happy with it
B000K02HZG|5|Good and fast shipping.
B000M5Y720|3|Bought it and it went out within a year, had to switch to HID. Overall this is a bright white light that has a short life span.
B00BGTM05W|5|great fit
B0006SH4PU|5|This is very good leather creme.  It restores cracked and dry leather seats.  The price is very reasonable and so you can afford to use it regularly without breaking your budget.
B00I54WHBS|5|good

B00PYD23DU|4|OK, good for the price and fits pretty good. Read the instructions and it will be fine
B00B5OB7O8|4|Great lights, blue is a little bit off though, almost more like purple but whatever.<br />Also has terrible adhesive on the back of the strip. Doesn't stick to any surface. I had to zip tie my lights to stay where I needed them but after finding a way to secure them they're great. Yeah I would buy them again. Definitely beats auto zones 30$ ridiculous prices.
B00I486BTY|5|Very true full about the timing. Would recommend to a friend
B00EKTIBKS|5|Fit a 2013 silverado nice.
B010W3V3EQ|5|Perfect fit great on time delivery
B00I3F38OY|5|These are well-built and as good as the factory buckle receptacles.  I use these on the 2014 forester-- be aware that this item number will fit the rear left and right passenger seats-- the center buckle will NOT work easily-- you may want to call the company to get the extender for that position.
B008PF1C2W|1|Fell apart after one use
B000S6P344|5|great fit,almost like stock.
B00UY8AVUW|1|Beware. This kit does not fit all coolers as advertised. My 04.5 LLY has larger cooler line fittings/ports. And they are O-ring fittings not npt like what was on the cooler from cx.
B0042OYYZM|5|purchased for a 2004 X5.  Had a local auto shop install it.  Was told it was a perfect fit and I haven't had any issues since.  Have not noticed it to be any louder than the original as mentioned in a couple reviews.
B00V3JSDA6|5|My car key recently fell out of the pocket of a loose-fitting pair of linen pants during a night on the town.The cost of a new transponder key is incredible expensive- the Toyota dealership and locksmiths essentially wanted me to trade them my first born child or sell them my soul in order to get a replacement key. It was time to search for an alternative. I purchased this for my 2007 Toyota Camry and it works perfectly! I took it to a local locksmith and they were able to cut and program it without a problem. The construction is solid and all of the buttons work fine(I haven't used the panic button yet though!)- it's just like the key that came with my car. I highly recommend this key to anybody with a Camry. Heck, I'll probably buy a couple more just to keep on hand. $20 is a little steep for what it is, but it beats trading my first born child. Also, if you plan on wearing linen pants you'll probably lose your keys.
B0009EUA0M|5|Nice quality construction. The metal lower tray is perfect for holding items, screws, tools, etc. Comfortable and functional.
B00KASNP90|5|Here are a couple of pros and cons:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Awesome fit<br />- Feels very comfortable<br />- Lots of storage<br />- Feels very safe<br />- Can be used as a winter jacket<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Big & Heavy<br />- Super hot. Impossible to wear from April through October.
B001O0AMNK|4|They work, the provided socket is an impact socket (good for service life). The color is more pink than in the pictures. The lugs on my car are fairly recessed, so I don't care too much.<br /><br />My wife wants a set for her car.
B007BL4VPQ|5|Product was excellent, fit for purpose, well packed for long distance transportation. Delivered on time. Super.
B00E1SQKO2|5|good
B006HJ2R18|5|good and easy if you know what youre doing
B009OHIW3W|5|Fits perfect
B0065WWNNY|1|Will not pump up a bicycle tire.
B0002NILP6|5|Great feel, good grip, and looks fantastic!
B009RXYK5C|4|I like this charger.  I've only used it on two batteries so far, but I was impressed on how &#34;smart&#34; the charger is, and how it went through different steps in an attempt to charge a bad battery.  It also did a good job on improving the charge on a &#34;fully charged&#34; battery in a 2 year old car.  The only reason I rated it only 4 stars, is I felt either the manual could be better to help me understand what stage the charger is in, or the charger would benefit from another LED or two, which could communicate to the user, what stage the charger is in.  Over all though, I would readily recommend this to anyone, and strongly prefer it over other chargers I have seen and used.
B000CLUER6|4|Meets expectations and proper fit. Much less than big box stores.<br />At this price you can afford to replace annually.
B00NFFE4YA|5|The best oil for Diesel engines !!! I use this oil for my 2011 VW 2.0 TDI. I have already 5000 miles and the engine ate only 250 ml. This is very good for  VW TDI.. usually oil thirsty !!!
B0036ULEV0|3|Nice piece of equipment, but the connection to the valve stem isn't great. You have to pay attention to make sure air is going into the tire.
B00SJXE9R0|5|Contrary to the other reviews I've used this little guy for 2 months now and it works fine. Now you have to be realistic, you can't put a soda that's 80°F in there and wait 5 minutes and expect it to be cold. You need to be patient wait like an hour or 2, and be sure to fill the fridge or else things won't get cold fast.
B0068FZWGI|4|amazing! i cant wait to order the clutch lever to have both of the same levers. its soo easy to install. all you need is a screwdriver and a small socket. also love the adjusting point for easy adjustment.
B0026CE6PA|2|they did not fit our 2015 Subaru Forester.  We sent them back.
B00EG83B26|5|Works great
B000CCOL38|4|Very hard to rate this product, since there is no great way to see the results, but it doesn't appear to have caused any harm either.
B001DRHN22|5|Quality Mann filter as always. Easily installed as replacement on 2002 Infiniti QX4. I've been using Mann filters for years on all my vehicles. I've never had an issue with their oil or fuel filters.
B000JFNAJY|5|Excellent price . Excellent product.
B002NF3110|5|I did not use this on my car.  I shoot archery and I used this product on my arrows to secure the fletching down.  So far so good.  The tape has stayed secure for a month now and there are no signs of it coming off.
B006WAMS70|5|It look great!  Keep in mind that this is the outline only.  It doesn't have the clear protective cover over the numbers.  still, 100% satisfied.
B00D8KJ8AM|5|Perfect Fit
B0030DM8JK|5|Easy to install. Very well made. Works just like new!
B008SGNT1K|4|fast shipping, good product, however the instructions are a joke, but you can make it work. for now I am satisfied...
B007LICL56|2|The screws were not long enough to fit my license plate frame.
B000PUK1J0|5|PERFECT FOR WHAT WE NEEDED AT A GREAT COST
B0002UQATS|3|Its ok but not great.  I originally purchased to use exclusively on my 3m clear bra and it works well there but showed some weird hazing characteristics when i did the full car.<br /><br />I dint want to break out the orbital and do a full wax so i decided to do the car with this instead so it would be slightly faster.  Applied after a GOOD wash in the shade in the morning so temps weren't much higher then 70F.  I waxed the whole car (Black) then cleaned the haze off about 30 minutes later.  I used two different knapp Chemical Guys microfiber towels, one for wax remover and one for buff.  It looked good but didn't &#34;pop&#34;.  About 2 hours later i look outside and it looks like its lost its sheen (haven't driven) so i go out there and its cloudy white again?  I clean of the dust and give it a finally buff a second time.  A couple hours later it did the same thing (still haven't driven) and i buffed it off a third time and this time it seems to have settled.
B000X21WRU|5|This product fit the cargo bay of my new Ford Explorer perfectly.  It also lies perfectly flat, and if you didn't know it, you would never suspect that it wasn't a Ford product delivered with the car.  It will keep the carpeted area underneath spotless clean for as long as I use it.  It's a good value.
B0022ZXO40|2|Clips broke on the first use ended up making my own but then the netting started coming loose. bought one for $3 more at auto zone that has now lasted 3 trips when this thing didn't last 1.
B007MVKBFY|5|I ordered this for my husband for Father's Day because when my older teens have friends over someone always ends up in his &#34;space&#34; So not only is it poking a bit of fun at a frustration that will (sadly) only be for a short time longer, it also puts a smile on his face every day. The sign is sturdy and metal just like any other sign you  would see around town. Very good quality.
B005J6JRMM|5|This fits the driver seat of my 2015 Honda CRV and that was the main reason for buying it. It does not work with a 2003 Honda pilot or 2003 BMW 325i front seats, not tested on any back seats.
B000CICYT0|5|Was skeptical of a cheap street 'stock replacement' clutch, but behind my 350hp 350 and Muncie 4 speed in my 1970 Camaro, it is great. Holds well and good pedal pressure. My kit did not come with the fork or cables.
B000630B1O|5|ok
B0009SQL2E|5|Nice tach, works well.  Good price point.
B004OJZDAK|5|We had bought a small camper trailer on craigslist and this jack broke as we were picking it up.  We searched all over town to replace it but could find nothing.  Thank Goodness for Amazon.  I was able to find the right one in a matter of minutes!  Thanks to Prime I received it fast!  It fit perfect and works great!  I think people forget that Amazon sells so much stuff, it's not just books and movies!
B008M8ST82|5|Good product I really liked thanks
B00AMLQ7KE|5|Fit great after swapping rear brackets. Looks great on the truck, are nice and sturdy, finish is holding up great so far.
B00RGZWIW0|5|This is a great trunk organizer.  Sturdy and easy to assemble.
B00BSUP4K2|5|An exact replacement.
B0089KNGNQ|5|Works great on my 2006 prius.  Make sure your current key has a silver prius logo on the back, or this probably won't work.  Both types are for sale here on Amazon, so no need to gamble on the wrong one.  Oh, and the chicken dance is for real.  Had to do it a few times to get it right.
B00O4XUHAM|5|I was vacationing with my niece and she had these in her car. They work so great getting in and adjusting hour sitting position, I had to have some.
B00T6SYORW|4|Worked great
B00KTHY5DM|5|Worked perfectly with the existing electronics and was very easy to assemble.  Make sure to order for your year and make.
B0002MSY90|5|good product . greatly satisfied
B00IWOZ4GQ|5|Great fit and quick shipper
B0012V6UKA|3|I really thought I had ordered the in-channel shades, but somehow in processing the order i chose this type. I hope I will like them okay, but the tape was messed up on one so one of them may not adhere like it should for the duration. We shall see-
B011DF61YY|4|Didn't come preset at 18psi, no instructions were included. However once I figured out how to set the proper psi, these things are a massive timesaver
B002AHKZ10|5|Just what the description says. :)
B00GSAUHB8|5|aok
B0060HVEOS|4|Good for small spots. Did not discolor sofa, however it does not spread over an area. So after spot cleaning, it became apparent that a professional clean was necessary in order to clean our sofa. Will keep around for small spots, but the product did not wow me.
B0013V6NBA|4|I like it, but don't know how it will hold up as it is a light plastic and the palm trees cover up a bit too much of the picture that is on my plate.
B0013LF3ES|5|It did exactly what it was suppose to do. I am confident I'll get several years use from this. The material is durable.
B00B9W4IHY|5|This stuff is great,  Doesn't put that super shiny greasy look on the tire like a silicone based product does.  It is more like a dark black clean look like when the tires were brand new.  Mine is on a 4 door sedan and didn't want that super shiny look.
B00480J4JG|5|Great quality bulbs... as advertised
B00N36OP7W|5|We own three different &#34;older-larger&#34; jump pack type units for use with camping or helping friends/family out with battery dead issue and they all did their job well. This is MUCH MUCH smaller in all and yet did the same job over the weekend for jump starting our 2003 Explorer 4wheel drive with the six cylinder engine while we were at the camp grounds. I am a believer that this unit can do as it said it can as it worked twice for us. I have an electronic engineering background and believe me when I say that this is a good little unit. After we returned home I plugged it in to the wall charger and it is ready for its next use. Side suggestion, pair this with an inverter and a little know-how and you can have a portable 110 volt house power portable unit for running a blender or toaster when camping.
B00I9Z781W|5|Works good
B00TQ4IJX6|5|Totally perfect Tesla Spoiler.  `xcellent packing.  SHould fit really well.  Thanks and quick shipping.
B0054LD2ZA|5|Good product
B002669TU8|5|This was a great deal as it was all one piece rather than a separate fan motor and assembly like some other products. Great price, fit perfectly, and it was easy to replace.
B009X3TL8M|5|Good smell
B00AWDV7PM|5|So adorable ... love it!
B000MKC6LO|5|Very good
B000CONU0G|5|Great
B000CB1MDG|5|Completed my front suspension repair perfectly.
B004E5B7YU|5|Great
B0031I2006|4|Just big enough for a full size moped/scooter, or perhaps a small motorcycle.
B002TO86NS|4|I have had a chance to use this head set for a few weeks now and find it very well made and of good quality. The sound is very good. My only complaint is the strap that goes around the back of the head. It does not fit well behind the ears.
B005C59NGK|1|Wrong part. Picture and item # were correct. Easy return policy.
B004TCICNM|3|These, in a container such as this, sometimes are dry. These work just OK. I would not purchase again. Hope this helps.
B000C9JPB4|5|Worked.
B0078U8SJ0|5|Great product and it fit my 97 tj perfectly.
B00DD27KPK|5|It is what it says it is.
B000CLO9TA|5|Installed and working very well
B00JAHATP0|5|Solid
B007WR6HCY|5|Worked great changed in 15 minutes check engine light went away
B000IZ2XF2|1|It simply did not seal. Oil started to leak through it right away, no matter what I tried. The slowest I got it to leak was about a drop a minute. This was a lot more than my old regular bolt. So I went to the store and got a new regular bolt, that obviously, sealed well.
B004EDF8HY|5|Very good product.
B001EOV492|5|Product was received just as described. Fast shipping!
B002YQVIH2|5|My mom has been wanting a Christian decal for her new car and I saw this on Amazon and ordered it for her. It was very nice and she loves it thank you
B00KQXKG46|5|I really like the light bar and out of all the light bars this one has the best mounting brackets.
B00RJKB2FQ|4|Comes exactly as advertised. Driven over 2000 miles stayed rock solid
B001FSESYU|5|Timely and as advertised.
B000IYLZDO|5|TLDR version:<br />This brake repair kit fixed my problem with a malfunctioning cruise control on a 2002 Ford Ranger pickup.  Received in original Motorcraft packaging.  Fit as from factory.  Worked like a charm.<br /><br />The long version:<br />We have a 2002 Ford Ranger Edge pickup that is an extra vehicle for us used for local hauling and gardening projects.  The cruise control had stopped working more than a year ago but wasn’t a real issue since we are rarely driving it for long distances.  After hauling some gear to my son from Tennessee to Ohio and back with no cruise control, I decided it was time for a repair (yes, cruise control has spoiled me).<br /><br />The symptom was that, after turning the cruise control “On”, the cruise control light on the dash would only flash but not stay engaged.  While having the truck serviced at a local Ford dealer, I asked them to diagnose the problem for me.  Their verdict…”your cruise control servo unit is defective”.  They quoted a repair cost of roughly $750 to repair.  That was more than I wanted to pay for a truck that sits in the driveway most of the time.  Doing some research, I found that replacing that unit is not that difficult.  After finding one from a salvage dealer online for $25, I did the replacement (took all of 15 minutes).  To my surprise, it did not fix the problem and I still had a flashing cruise light and no cruise control.<br /><br />Hours of reading and searching the Web led me to purchase this brake activation sensor/switch.  Installed it in about 5 or 10 minutes and it fixed the problem.  Since this sensor/switch had failed, each time I tried to engage the cruise control, the sensor was telling the servo unit that the brake was being applied and disengaged the cruise control.  This was the reason for the light flashing on and then immediately going off.  Replacing the defective brake sensor is all that was needed to correct the problem.<br /><br />As a side note, this truck’s cruise control had been subject to a previous Ford recall on cruise control units.  They installed the wiring harness with imbedded fuse to prevent fires, but did not replace the original brake sensor since it was not leaking.  You can tell if your sensor is the original by its color.  Original is orange…replacement is black.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful information for others dealing with the same issue.
B006YTTV4W|5|great product....Note: silicon dries in 15-20 mins....don't apply until you're ready
B00COYNZJ8|5|Open pkg- only problem was one string was broken that wrapped around it, but my Husband does not use those anyway.
B000C5WD08|5|Item received excellent . Recommended . Thank you...
B000NK79BA|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B001FC94CC|5|Works great..
B007KGVZVU|5|These jackets run super small. I have worn an XL for the past 15 years, but I could not put my arms in the XL jacket I tried.
B000C9O4M4|3|bushings wrong size to large
B00ARUQ4MQ|5|Exactly as described. Exact fit for my 2007 Chevy Aveo. Installed myself in about 15 minutes.
B008VVES4Y|5|If you are not a hard core rider, this is a great helmet.  I only ride side by sides and this was a great helmet for that.
B000TYVU1U|4|As describe.
B011DF61YY|5|great product and customer support
B009X1WVYK|2|The product I received is a 1 piece bag with a divider liner that hold both panels.  The picture of what I thought I was ordering was 2 padded, zippered, bags, 1 for each panel.
B0085Y4L6M|5|fast del. right part
B00Z9NWT7U|5|Works great, as intended.
B00GC6BPTQ|1|Order took 2 1/2 weeks to arrive from China. The description I ordered stated the stripe was a matte finish; however it was a high gloss. That was disappointing!
B00U8O8GSG|5|I was tired of replacing the exterior lights of my RV with light bulbs. Plus I light the cool white versus the yellow better, so I wired these in on the exterior of the RV. WOW, calm soothing light that is bright enought to see a good 15 ft away from the RV. I put 4 across the front of the RV and it was perfect. As cheap as these where, I wouldnt mind replacing these when they do go out.
B00CJGF8OQ|1|these things are a rip off even at this price. they don't fit the sliding cover fully and still leave a gap on the bottom or top no matter where u place it and the two way tape is a joke it barely stays on the metal frame. the overall length is 12&#34; but the part that is suppose to fill in the gap of the sliding piece is not the right length. i have ordered these from other places and the design is the same for all of them. so its a design flaw. don't bother to buy no matter what the deal cause it wont fit correctly.
B002UC8OT0|3|For my trailer, the knob was an exact match for the originals. The screw was too long, but it doesn't affect the function. Won't last forever, but it's good enough. Make sure you order the right shaft length.
B00EA2BJ7W|4|Product came in a timely manner; however, did require an adapter to install on my 2006 Avalanche truck.
B00KLSX3ZK|5|Very pleased with the price and simplicity of the installation. Works great thus far!
B00DWVN08I|5|Sturdy rubber. Shipped quickly. I actually sprayed my receiver with a little rubberized undercoat paint, on the inside, to cover a little rust. After drying for a day or so, it gave the plug an even better snug fit. I don't tow a lot, so I don't take the plug in and out much. I imagine that also helps keep the good fit.
B001R93K0K|5|Fabulous item! Thank you.<br />* Easy to apply. It's a quick four step process in overall. 1. Receive mail 2. Gently take off the outer layering (Which goes into trash) 3. Gently take apart the actual &#34;Coexist&#34; sticker 4. Apply to a flat surface . Just like that.<br />And, the meaning behind the word itself is quite powerful.<br />To exist all at the same time in tolerance to one another's diverse perspective, BEAUTIFUL.<br />Thank you!
B004P5W66M|5|Worked perfect. Fit like OEM
B00WW885DM|5|I ordered these for a 2003 Jeep Liberty Sport. Exact replacement fit for my worn out originals. Seem to be quality made, and so far no issues. Other than the P/N sticker on it, I could not tell any difference between these and the originals other than my originals were shot. So I would recommend these to anyone. Also highly recommend ARANA Auto Dept. They shipped very quickly and packed the items very safely.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Delivered on Time and works as specified in the documentation.
B00PFFG1EO|5|Great product, however the app's you are suppose to use with it appear to no longer be available through the app store.  I found the app Carista for Iphone works great.<br /><br />Installation was as simple as plug it in, look for the Vlink network and you are done.  Can't get much easier than plug it in and turn it on.<br /><br />I used this on my 2000 Mercedes e320.
B007TJXHZA|5|It fit no problem
B00BJMKZ76|5|Perfect fit and easy to install and shipped ahead of tiime!
B00IPS47XU|5|could have been a little bigger but exactly want I was looking for.
B00I4E91GI|5|The best stuff. Just wish I ever got the rebate which made this a very nice real.
B00X47MX1A|5|Got it 2 days after I bought it, works great and is a great quality part
B0027DUPQ2|5|Bolts rite up and works great,
B00NQD21AK|5|fit perfectly.
B000HE5G0S|5|Used this for my 1999 7.3 PSD tranny cooler upgrade to the 6.0 Tranny cooler.  Great hose and great price.  Glad I got it all on amazon at the same time.
B00A4U38PK|5|Fit my 2004 frontier. The problem with these are that the handle is plastic, so they break easy. They should make them in metal, but they don't. The part was exactly as expected and needed.
B00CU5G9AI|5|RAV4 Toyota 2014 model. Very nice expensive looking chrome finish. Two inch tubes, easy to install, adds value to the truck and protects the front,<br />I'm very happy with my purchase.
B0081ZYPP2|5|made for my air tank
B006IWQGZW|5|My boyfriend likes them. Already installed on his truck.
B00GOB8KPG|2|As another reviewer stated, the radius of the protector is not right and does not correctly align with a 2015 Mazda 3.
B008Y3O2PY|5|Quick shipping and perfect fit.
B00F3J2FW4|5|Excellent, so happy with my purchase!  These mats are amazing. The detail of the tire treads are awesome!
B00FPL0LV2|4|Exact replacement for the often dying Nissan window motors (apparently a very common problem). Be sure to look up how to get the unit to memorize when it is fully up & down (need to push in the switch on the side of the motor, but there is a sequence you need to follow). Window works well now.
B00GAPLVCA|5|Haven't installed yet but spicer is known for their quality.
B00A1XDD7I|5|Heard good reviews on the Toyota filters so I'm expecting to not having any issues.
B008VC78Z4|5|I couldn't get the filter collar off without the wrench. with the wrench, it came off easily.
B00E9G07JK|5|Fast shipping! Alternator worked awesome.
B00KRJV24M|5|Beautiful
B00RM327NG|5|GREAT product!  I love it for its versatility!!
B00EC2CG9U|2|kinda useful but they knot at the ends doesn't fit in the metal part and is awkward. hard to explain but I probably wouldn't buy again.
B004FCWH3W|5|I drive a Mercedes and could not get my handicap placard to fit on the rearview mirror. So I set out to find something to hold my placard. After researching, I came across this nifty little thing.  I read the reviews & I live in TX and even saw a review stating it doesn't work for TX placards, but it does! with a little clipping off the bottom (just the blue is cut, no numbers or anything important) and the sides stick out just a little on each side, but other than that, I love it!  I have it clipped on my passenger side visor and I don't even flip the placard down, I just flip the whole visor down and it is well seen from the outside.  Very good item and great price - plus it was shipped fast too!  Thank You!
B00KPWBDZY|5|These are nice, especially with the star cutouts on the step area. They weren't too bad to mount for me, but I do recommend a second person as these are heavy. I used a floor jack to help hold them up while I put the screws in place. They look really good and add to the rugged trail look. FYI, they do not stick out as far as the factory side steps.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Thank you!
B000A0CAJE|5|As described. Easy install.
B001LHVOVK|4|It works good. Haven't had any problems with the scanner at all. And it's pretty cheap. Not too fancy but that's not an issue it does what I need it to.
B005N53C9I|5|Excellent product, but I had to have one of the seat covers exchanged after the wrong product was initially shipped.  Amazon replaced it very quickly and I'm very satisfied as a result.
B00GJ1EJ92|5|Fit my 1998 Buick Park Avenue perfectly.  No more crunchy noise!!!
B000TYVL78|5|Prefect fit works like new. Would recommend to anyone.
B00G6188EM|4|It was a bit on the expensive side but this made my bike look way cooler.
B002XM39M4|1|Installed the locks and two of the tumblers fell apart with in the first week
B00ZJ78F7E|1|This does not fit my vehicle or any other Chevy from 2000-2006 it will only fit 2007-2014 only.The item description needs to be fixed so that others won't be shipped wrong item.
B000WP9XEM|5|The gas would leak out of the petcock when it was in the On & Res position. Read that it could be the rubber seals so I bought this Petcock Rebuild/Repair Kit. Used it on an 1983 CB (Nighthawk) 650 and it worked like a charm. Great fix!
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Very shiny lights but my car keep sending an error about the lights.
B000WJC0U2|5|I needed to replace the alternator in my 83 CB650 and I tried using a work around to get the rotor off, but nothing worked. Bought the proper tool (shocking I know) and it worked wonderfully.<br /><br />To use it:<br />Hand tighten the puller into the rotor (don't want to cross thread)<br />Once it is hand tightened, take your wrench/ratchet and tighten it a little bit<br />Take a hammer and hit the puller a few times<br />Rotor should pop right off
B000CNH8GO|5|I use Fel-pro almost exclusively for gaskets.  This gasket was for my wifes minivan.  The price from Amazon Prime was 20% less than I could get from any of my local suppliers.  One note of caution.  It is common for pitting to occur around the coolant ports on this cover and on the engine block.  If severe the cover will need to be replaced.  You can go ahead and apply a thin layer of RTV silicone sealant at these ports http://smile.amazon.com/Permatex-82180-Maximum-Resistance-Silicone/dp/B0002UEN1U/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&ie=UTF8&qid=1439184339&sr=1-1&keywords=rtv+sealant.  Don't apply RTV around the ports oil<br />travels through.  Apply a thin layer of grease if you think it needs a little help around the oil ports.  Make sure you apply RTV in the corners<br />where the cover meets the pan and block, both in the front and back of the pan gasket.<br />You will need a pan gasket to do this job.<br /><br />Steve NV7V<br />Master ASE Technician L1 A9<br />Precision Auto Experts<br />Orem, Utah
B004SCP6ZA|5|Very Nice ...easy to place and looks good
B00480J4KA|4|Works!
B001DRJICU|1|Tps fit my Buick grand national but as soon as it would get up to operating temp I would lose tps signal.
B000OCHEOY|5|This is a big, heavy, industrial-grade air hose reel that's well made, with quality fittings.  It's got some &#34;kick&#34; to it too when returning the hose on the reel.  Should last me a lifetime.
B008KV4KP2|5|Direct replacement for Onan #149-2331-02.  Fits my Onan Emerald Plus 5000.  I saw a comment that Airtex makes these for Onan and judging by appearance that's likely.  This Airtex is about one-third the price however.  The pump works as it should, is easy enough to install, and it fixed the stall after getting warm/hot problem.
B00BG9JWP8|1|Was not the right fit...
B000BZEH3A|5|It does it's job.  But I rated it 5 stars because of the value, when compared to the same sensor at any of the local auto parts stores.  Fit was fine.  Wire length was a little long for my application, but it came with wire ties to tie up the extra length.  No problem with that.
B000BYB1WG|1|I have not had good service from this product. I actually tried two of these ignition control modules in AC Delco in my 1995 Camaro Z28. On both occasions the module went bad after 30-45 minutes of use. In both cases I re-installed my old aftermarket ignition control module and the car has run fine. I purchased the AC Delco brand because I was trying to fix an ignition problem I had and hoped the factory brand replacement would be a better product but that didn't prove to be the case for me. Eventually I discovered the problem to be a different item. Consequently I am continuing to use the aftermarket ICM which is working fine.
B004KEIU1S|5|Did what it's meant for, came as promised
B00FTDJ9FA|3|brighter than normal bulbs but not by much.
B00BTFDW14|5|This is a super nice set. It's good solid quality, the gauges are accurate, the fittings don't leak, and it fits R12, R134A, R22, R99, and probably several more I'm unfamiliar with. This is a great manifold set for really good price.
B00545OUYS|5|seem to be a good product just started using
B007ZDDUCK|5|Absolutely great!
B00EC1N76C|5|Great replacement for cloudy lenses. Use all the time.
B00TOZPSBS|5|Works great and looks good easy to install.
B00COTN7EQ|4|Did not seal the rear stake pockets
B0071MFJTW|1|I bought a full set of Sensen struts and strut mounts from another vendor (initials RA). They are the worst parts I have ever put on a car. I replaced the struts and mounts on my 1999 Toyota Avalon because they were noisy; the replacement Sensen parts made MORE NOISE than the original parts within ONE DAY of installation.<br /><br />These aren't even good enough to put on a car you are going to sell immediately.<br /><br />The Sensen parts have a lifetime warranty, but the warranty is only valid for replacement with the same low quality part.
B0043GTOGS|1|Came in a bag not a box. I gave 1 star only because I expected them to come in the original box not a bag. I sent them back!
B0082JKVLE|4|Works fine.
B005HF3BWW|5|Great suction and it looks good on my windshield.  This is a much better alternative than the velcro that people normally use.  I ended up buying this because the velcro that came with my EZ pass was stuck on my old car and couldn't be removed.
B001U5BJT0|2|Expensive for what it is, Very high quality towel but not much better than the cheaper packs that are like 17 bucks for 12 towels.
B000E7YYDS|5|Best nozzle i've ever used!
B00RE6KV48|4|Not sure how to compare to other products, but does seem to do the job. I used on 10 year old Caddy leather seats. They are thicker leather so it took 3 applications to see any improvements. On the first application, the absorption was spotty, but improved with each treatment. The leather did not get that much softer but did not feel dry as before. Not really sure what to have expected.<br /><br />Will penetrate thinner or finer leather more deeply.<br /><br />Not sure if I'd buy again or try a different brand. This bottle goes a long way so won't know the answer for awhile.
B00GT2FUB2|3|The Iphone 5 attachment included with the package did not charge the phone.  However, using the original cord in the USB port charged the phone just fine.
B0031ZDU62|4|perfect and affordable
B00VGL8MEI|5|Does what it is supposed to do, except there is no hitch pin.
B007US8PH0|4|It works. I like that it uses a single ground point for both ballasts and the relay. Some relay harnesses require drilling more holes for more grounds.
B0031I8FFU|5|Fit as expected and were a high quality part. No challenges with the install, just needed to &#34;rent&#34; a caliper tool to back the piston into the caliper. Delivery was quick, and I was able to complete the job when I wanted to do it.
B007OW62V8|5|This filter is the perfect replacement for my 2012 Toyota Prius.  I get my oil changed at the dealership, and I love when they tell me something needs to be changed, like this air filter.  Unfortunately for the dealership, I don't let them change it for me because it is so expensive.  I just go online and order the item myself and change it myself.  I love how Amazon keeps a long history of your purchases because I can always look back and reorder a product I liked.
B001DME4PG|5|Steps look great on my truck
B007MHKP4A|5|Looks amazing on my car!!!!
B00NF1Q8P2|4|Pros: perfect fit, included hardware  Cons: the access hole is not directly under the oil filter, the shield will need to be removed for every oil change  Also needed: 2 x 1/2 in. push-in automotive fasteners, lower side panels for engine splash shield (BP4K-56-114D, BP4K-56-115F), car ramps  I received the parts on time, in new condition. Installation was simple, but took about an hour. The trickiest part was holding the panel in place and interlocking  the tabs which help align it in the correct position, while screwing in the bolts. Be sure to secure the vehicle , and wait  for the engine to cool. Protect your eyes from falling rust and debris.   The splash shield shipped with a bag of all the required hardware, including bolts and 2 large push-in fasteners. I could only see that one nylon fastener was needed for my car, but it might be needed for a different model. After assembly, I noticed 2 smaller mounting holes near the front bumper, which were too small for the included fasteners, but too large for the remaining bolts in the assembly kit.  I picked up a pair of 1/2 inch push-in nylon fasteners from the local hardware store , and these are holding fine.  NOTE: To mount the under engine splash shield, I also needed the side panels  which attach inside the wheel wells. When my original splah shield ripped off, parts of the 2 mounting panels also broke. The parts I needed were:  BP4K-56-114D, BP4K-56-115F. They did not come with hardware, but I was able to reuse the existing bolts and push-in fasteners that were still attached to the vehicle.  Good luck.
B000C9P0OK|5|Exact fittings and great quality
B00CHDBGF6|3|It arrived slightly damaged. Also it was not made as well as the factory item. The sheet metal it was made from seemed a little thinner than factory.
B000COX0MY|5|Love these no much more than the old school pin that you have to yank out.  Great idea.
B00SBZAG5U|5|Received this frame in good order. The frame is very shiny and matches the chrome trim on our car very nicely. The enclosed screws were the right size also. The size holds our Michigan plate perfectly, with everything, including the expiration sticker, totally visible. Didn't use the screw covers because I didn't want the removal hassle, besides which we never used any in the past. Very rich looking.
B005JPJOFS|5|This is a very high quality piece of equipment.  I intentionally bought something high-end because i was tired of being frustrated with cheap machines.  This machine is very well made and very easy to use.
B00OYEL480|2|Nice looking distributor. After install I got no spark at all, replaced ICM,coil,cleaned plugs, checked fuel pressure.<br />Swapped distributor with my original and it started no problem. Sensor was junk. Swapped it out and used the original sensor from my old distributor(Mitsubishi branded) works great now.<br /><br />It does have brass connections and the package it came in was excellent, sandwiched in foam in a box. Even has a warrenty card for a year.
B00ATPBW1W|5|Perfect!
B001CQWM8E|5|Solid mount w/2 piece metal clamp, no plastic on mount mechinism. Easy installation, good visiability, no vibration,installed on Kawasaki Mule. Very pleased w/product.
B00CG3T71C|5|Perfect for my wife's car.
B000E2682S|5|Super easy to install, took like 10 minutes. Performs excellent, easy to adjust.
B00QRHDIPY|1|I did as the instructions  indicated. Did not work at all
B00I82C0D2|5|the lugs fit good
B004NOPEN2|4|It serves its purpose and clears snow very well. I do wish the scraper was twisted 90 degrees because I really have watch out when brushing to not hit the car with the scraper.
B001L9KI56|5|This little gadget saves my hand and wrist while on trips. The angel is easily adjustable and can be roteted so it does not have to be used if you don't want it in traffic.
B00J712QAU|4|Wastes a little space.  About a half inch gap all around down in console. Top fills space nicely, so I don't get why interior is narrower.
B001GMX9FO|5|I bought this T-Connector to have trailer lights on my 2008 Honda Civic LX when pulling a small utility trailer. It only took me about 20 minutes to install including partially removing the trunk carpet and reinstalling it after I was finished. Lights on my small trailer now work great. Easy and effective way to have trailer lights in a vehicle that wasn't wired with a harness from the factory.
B001RKH7FS|5|Used this in a cross country trip to refrigerate medication. It worked great. It's not too big and had room for a few other things. Very portable and easy to carry.
B0000AXPDU|5|Good lock
B00FEXD0MI|4|Holes are not pre drilled and its not curved to the contour of the front bumper. Otherwise its good for the price
B004ZG7CTM|5|Great seat, lowered my riding position a good 5&#34; from the stock bicycle seat.
B004HCS4PK|5|Exelent
B00BMPXGHQ|5|Good quality ... works as expected.
B00T455PGQ|3|Seems good we will see how long they last
B003CXB77W|5|a near perfect fit, and has stayed on during heavy wind.
B009GKIWAU|5|Control arm went on easy as pie...good fit
B000NTKRSI|5|Oem quality.  That's what make buying most auto parts on amazon make good sense.
B000XQ8OP4|4|Nice product.
B002UC4TFI|5|LOVE IT
B000CMH4BY|5|Perfect
B00QYMY72A|1|This product was not what I expected. The lights do not work well unless the wires are a certain way; when I first opened the product two of the four lights were broken.
B000GZRB6A|3|Sorry, didn't work. It's not my fault for not complaining. I thought something was wrong with my Bike, but it was the battery I received. I bought another one locally, and wala! Too much time passed to complain and ask for reimbursement. that was my fault, but it doesn't change the fact that it didn't work.
B002PL5818|5|As expected
B001BY0A2M|5|This is the best glass cleaner I have found
B001IWLCGU|5|Fit my 2010 VW CC perfectly. Virtual replica to factory windshield wiper. Very happy with performance 1 month in.
B00OYMQI6U|1|Clear marker dissolves color even after the color has dried.
B00BTLEJAQ|3|The material isn't the greatest. One of the tie straps busted as I was installing it.
B002ITBPI2|5|Love it.
B000GU5R5M|1|Don't waste your money.  This is my second Cycle Visions module (thought maybe the first one dying after 2 months was a fluke and tried again)  This one stopped working 5 weeks after purchase.  My right rear turn signal stopped working.  Upon removing the module the light worked fine.  No return allowed after 30 days.
B00JG42SBU|5|Delivered within two days as was stated to me. Fit and color was perfect. Very satisfied. Excellent storage option.
B005C5EMXY|5|Excellent!
B001N7986G|5|Very cute. Very happy with it. Delivery time was 2 days. Lover Amazon
B0010E3JUI|5|Easy to install, seemed a lot better quality than my previously Jiffy Lube installed $20 filters. Would purchase again and would recommend.
B000O1C47M|5|Ecxellent and fast shipping !!!!
B003RW29FW|5|Had a large crack at the top of my 2005 Keystone camper and was afraid to use it. Duct tape had been applied to close the gap, but was not comfortable with this. After all the good reviews I received on the Eternabond, we decided to order it, So glad we did - Used camper this last weekend after traveling to our destination, we felt confident that the crack was sealed and would not crack further or leak.
B000OZS9Y0|5|These are great, just what was needed to give an added thing to hold on to, when and where needed.
B00HEVB8N6|5|Good price fast shipping
B009AFIM8S|5|Fit great!
B00MG0C2BW|5|Awesome
B00KMOB3YQ|5|Great decals.
B0040D2QC8|5|Fit the front bumper on my 2000 silverado 1500
B000C1LW0E|5|Works like a champ!
B00M9IEP2K|3|item did not come with the correct parts.
B002DZF1X6|5|didn't come on spool, but was correct length, worked well on my project.
B00EXGEBQG|5|Great thanks
B00069CN2I|3|helped a lot
B00AC6VWRC|5|good experience perfect shipping
B00UBUQXQE|5|Good smell
B00NRVCOZS|5|Very happy with this HID kit. I had them installed on my 1999 BMW 540I in under 30 minutes. Just as bright as my stock xenon on my other BMW. Bought the warning cancellors to go with it and have not had anything show up on my dash yet. I was a little worried about the slim ballasts as I had heard full size are better but couldn't beat the price on these. They work amazing! I was also worried the 6000k would be to blue but they look great to me. The picture of them driving is blurry because my camera was set on manual for some reason but you get a good idea of how bright they are. They light up the road better than my hi beams. Very happy with the product and customer service.
B0036TOFY4|2|LIke everyone else said you have to buy your own bolts. For the price you'd think they were included
B00VR8126K|5|I love the gloves. They are comfortable and breathe great. Seller was very helpful and prompt when I needed a size exchange. I would do business with them again.
B004JPPSCC|5|Fit great
B000CPAVUM|5|Perfect.
B00AQZB0V2|4|It worked and with the help of youtube I was able to install easily. A little pricy but better tham the dealer.
B0091J1PUU|5|These springs gave the Eclipse GS a nice stance and handles very well
B00TPR7D8Q|5|Nice
B0002Z9QO4|2|Drove through horrible storm. Water did get inside. It was a horrible storm but I would have thought it would be more weather proof.
B001FSCJCI|3|This gasket might work for many vehicles but if you are ordering it for the PSR on a e46 BMW then buyer beware. It did not fit for me and would have required some very clever methods of screwing on the cap while stretching the gasket to ever fit correctly. Conclusion. Wrong gasket for the E46.
B00PSPSC20|5|Looks good.  Fits well.  Use one rubber washer to make it more secure.  Great product.
B000ET9SB4|5|I love it.
B00L9VWAUC|5|Been about a month now. So far no problems. Vehicle performing well.
B001C8YSS4|5|Excellent, see my EBC yellow pads review.
B000QR12NG|5|Awesome part
B00ANNAJSC|1|I bought 2 of these shocks for 2007 Kia Sorento, plus KYB 340045 & 34004646 front struts.  One strut died in 2 months and I replaced it with same strut.  Now both struts on front and shocks on rear are bad and leak one year later.  KYB would not honor guarantee. Never again KYB
B00Q3JTSRI|5|It was a struggle to put on but.....Excellent because all the auto shops I went to...... no one carried 13.5 size.<br />And those that did... it was female oriented.
B0074NOP5M|1|Wrong item was a not good buy
B00CUEI786|4|It's fun.
B00SK8R4NK|5|Amazing product if ur looking for a delete this is it just need a longer hose
B00PSRORH2|5|Keeps the car noticeably cooler!
B000W0RQY6|5|Arrived ontime and as described.
B004EWI94E|5|Just what I needed
B006X152SU|3|Hung it off my sissy bar over the pillion. It is great for day to day stuff I need quick access to.
B00Q1NQ6Q2|5|I couldn't have been any happier.a  very well made and complete unit
B007P73YO0|5|It's really fast delivery and fixed very well Honda Odyssey 2003
B003YJI55Q|5|Great, was what I wanted.
B000GV9VDU|5|It fits, shipped timely, I'm overall pleased.
B000CAYT7I|5|Good performance. I will buy again.
B00JTUBP6U|5|the best
B000VZJ712|5|Better price than I can find locally for this plug on my 2001 Kawasaki W650. Did not cost much more than a standard plug locally.<br /><br />Arrived quickly.
B000PA03AC|5|Worked like a charm on my old 2004 X5 3.0 (RIP). Taking out the head unit to plug this in was a pain, but well worth it when considering how much I could have been charged for it. Routed this to the ashtray and drilled a hole into the ashtray assembly to mount the 3/8 female plug and plug plate. Looked professional. There are also routing options to go through your glove compartment, but that seemed like it was kind of defeating having an aux-in if you didn't have easy access to it.
B00Y5N1ZWU|5|Alot heavier than I though it'd be in a good way and it definately is great quality and installed 100% smoothly and OEm spec on my shifter.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Works great
B00NBN1C78|5|This is a brilliant idea and offers some peace of mind while being out and about hauling a trailer.  It works perfectly for our lighter-weight trailer- our 24' enclosed auto-trailer, but it's perfect for our open trailer.  It installs easily, and everything's right there, accessible in case of emergency!
B00415CKEE|5|Correct part, easy to install. Saved 50 bucks doing it myself.
B0010DW5ZO|4|Same quality as the dealer puts in for a fraction of the price. Very easy to install, save yourself some money and try one
B007OW6MD6|5|Never knew I needed these. So now I gotta buy some for my Tahoe. Don't want any leaks from the drain plug.
B00K1C1WC2|5|I work on my cars a lot and safety is the most important aspect when working on them. Thought these would slip but they actually stay in place. These worked as advertised and were very affordable.
B00ACJ0O0K|5|Good product, received quickly!
B004MAV2JC|2|Purchased this with the ram air intake for 03 GMC Duramax, I always thought highly of the banks attention to detail until I spent my money on this P.O.S , if you have anything bigger than stock tires it will rub when you make a sharp turn left. not enough clearance for tires, I run 265, 85 r16 , had to do a bit of a hack job to get clearance after it rubbed a whole in it on the test run. Not sure if you want to waist your money.
B00DSD7J8W|5|Prompt delivery and delivered undamaged. Very satisfied with the price and quality of sticker.
B003THUDTO|1|This was great at first. Now the hose will not lock and always wants to retract. I can here is click but nothing. Every now and then it will hold at the every 3 feet and then all of the sudden, with no tension on the air hose, it will start retracting. Not very safe when using my air tools.
B003YJI1XW|5|worked great on my topper
B000BGHYP2|1|Came with porcelain bowl cracked, ordered a replacement directly from Thetford and it arrived with an even more badly cracked bowl. Either needs better packing or better shipper.
B001DKPXU8|5|Seemed a little thin at first. Also, the purple color always throws me off a little bit. But it quieted a pump with 170000 miles on it down to a whisper and gave piece of mind that my rack and pump won't be getting any worse.
B000CMGHIK|5|My Husband was able to install this in a matter of moments, it fit perfectly on my car, and this new belt really mad a difference in my cars performance!
B0050HGZC0|4|Will not fit over my rear view mirror so  I hang it on the visor.  Great idea and hope it will last a long time.
B007IOBM4E|5|the best
B00RL1PXMG|3|Just got it today. Feels very light, I was bit suspicious about strength an clamp mechanism also it was bit smaller but bit longer then my other paddle. Got in my car and headed toward Atlantic (North-East in NH). To may surprise Ocean was choppy and waves up to 7-9 Ft on incoming tide. I was expecting waves around 2-3 Ft. Anyway I got in to water on my SUP, couldn't stand up so I was paddling on my knees. Noticed wright away that I have to paddle much harder to catch the surf. I kept trying for 30-40 min. and then I switched to my old one. After all paddle survive a quiet strength test. Length adjustment was easy and was holding. Very light and good ergonomics but definitely not for surfing just not enough push. For come water I would recommend this paddle.
B00JBI9DDW|5|Like em
B0085KGOH0|4|this does the job well, but because of what it is for I just can't love it
B00C908EQ6|5|Great bang for the buck. Bought 2 just to be sure that I had enough. Ended up not tinting my headlights. Did fog lights on my a6 and gti. Wrap is good quality. Not a tissue thin paper. Very thick. Quality I used to wrap text books in. Just make sure you know how to install it properly or you will end with wrinkles. Slow and steady for a great install. I recommend taking off the housing you plan on wrapping, unless you have experience tinting other things such as back windows to a car.
B00XRKUYR4|5|I'm definitely going to order again when I run out !!!
B00G8R69RC|5|Great lights for the cost, have stayed sealed!!
B0031I6E4Y|5|Great price and shipped right away
B000GZKH20|5|👍
B00GKTZCPI|3|I had gotten one of these stickers a while back for myself. My boyfriend (who is in the Air Force) liked it so much when I showed him that I decided to get him one as well. I had zero issues with the first one, but the second one arrived bent. And it's not like the envelope was bent: there is a crease in the sticker but not in the envelope, which makes me think it happened when it was getting ready to be shipped. Not the end of the world, I guess, but it's disappointing.
B006GJK8MY|5|Great spring load and they ride very nice on and off the trails.
B000TYTZQM|4|Fit perfectly, my only concern was that one of the packages had been opened and taped shut again. The nut was still the one as advertised.
B00WHMLWPG|2|Really cheat looking, hope it last!
B00192KY22|5|I just followed the instructions and had a perfect, fast fit for my 1999 Dometic. As Chris pointed out it is a 10 minute install. The hardest part was digging the old silicone off the old brittle cover. I'd buy it again but I'm hoping it will last the 15 years the original did.
B000BR3BF8|5|Best deal out there.
B00M1OUBES|3|The unit seems OK on small things like a telephone, but when I hooked it up to my truck, it did not do the job.  The cables were so hot I could barely touch them.  I looked at them carefully and realized that the cables were12 gauge, certainly not large enough to start any car.  I have seen people try to start cars with 12 gauge jumper cables (no luck).  Twelve gauge wire is only supposed carry 20 amps.  I retried to start the car with my 0 gauge cables with success.  I did this on two separate occasions, different people involved.  I made up some cables out of 0 gauge cable and have not had a need for them yet, but I think that they will work.  I'll let you know if I have your address or you send it to me
B000ALG86E|3|No complaints about the quality of the car cover or the arrival time. My only complaints is that it says it fits 2008 5 series BMW and it definitely does not!
B004ZF4RXC|5|Bright.  Easy.  Affordable.  Great- no amazing customer service JIC something goes wrong.
B00029WSVI|5|I see my rear whatever the time of day may be: night, day, whatever
B00AOAFP9C|5|Sucked the oil out of my Mercruiser in under a minute!  SO much easier than the suction hand pump ones.  This this is worth every penny!
B00BCOJ2KM|4|it good... hard to adjusted but one is in... fire and forget
B007BID1SC|5|Looks good, nice white pop against factory tint, now sure how its going to hold up but so far, as expected
B00G96VESG|5|Fuse holder works good. Wire is nice size.
B004LWTHP2|4|Defective units, as the mode button will go out and stick down making the unit worthless, and all of these chargers are designed the same way using that same cheap plastic clicky mode button. I suspect heat from the sun and heat from the charger makes it happen faster. Since these have been out for years now, the company has to know this and yet they are still building them the same. So no accident.<br /><br />In all other ways it seemed fine until the on mode button stuck down. I used it not that many times over 3 years. Keep it it out of the hot sun and away from heat, and it may last a little longer. May.<br /><br />OK friends and neighbors I am raising this from the 2 rating to a 4 rating, and the reason is I found a solution to the sticky mode button and it sticking down and it not coming back up. A tiny amount of WD-40 sprayed on that tiny mode button, and allowed to sit for 10-30 minutes freed it right up, and it feels and works fine now. Do not use a lot, just the tiniest amounts right on the button, and if it gets elsewhere on the charger wipe it off then and there. The company and anyone else that finds this of great help can now send me a million each....
B00WFIJ362|5|At first I was skeptical but then I went ahead and gave it a try i had a 06 gsxr 1000 that I took with me on a beach camping trip. I was afraid I would have to take off my spare tire of my fj cruiser to fit the bike in the back of the truck but did not have to at all which was a relief !!...you might need to get a light kit because it might block your turn signal..I was scared the whole way to the campsite but coming back home I was confident my bike wasn't goin anywhere..if u don't want to haul a trailer then this is the one to get!! Parking in a tight spot is no problem.built sturdy too
B001C6JCU0|5|worked great on my 98 wrangler.
B000CMJ0OS|5|Just as described, very nice piece.
B00NQM480C|1|Its that simple
B0009I7KC4|5|Great
B004ME8MZ0|5|Great fit! quick and easy.
B001DRLPUS|5|air filter--what can I say?
B00BR1E8WC|4|Serves the purpose as a cover if you're coming out of the gym soaked with sweat and keeps seats clean. Downside is they constantly need tucked in the car as they tend to follow you out of the car when you get out.
B0065UNC6S|5|all good
B00V5QDJI8|5|Super happy with the look and feel, highly recommend it.
B0067UCBFE|5|Great would reccommend
B00B7GRFS6|5|if you're buying an emblem you will definitely want these.
B00IKKS4W8|5|I installed 4 jacks on my travel trailer and was very impressed with these jacks. For the prize, they can't be beat. They are well built, solid products and I was very happy with them. So glad to get rid of the crappy old jack that came on the trailer.
B00CC9GIAS|5|fit perfectly which is surprising, love the shield
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Works excellent on leather furniture!
B000I8VLBG|5|Much easier to install if you take the intake off, besides that easy install. It takes about 15 seconds after plugging in to feel warm to the touch after install, so I would say that it's very effective. Worth the money. 2006 Cummins 5.9
B00IO32XPK|5|I think this one is the better of the replacements. The earlier generations were all plastic, this one contained metal which I think was the problem with the First Generation.
B002JFQFNA|5|Great shades for the price!
B0032I9N1Y|5|If you think they're too small, you shouldn't be wearing them anyway. They'll fit, if you know what to do.
B002PQW6NG|5|As some others have mentioned, the light can be a snug fit.  After playing around with it for a while though both lights successfully installed and make the car look like new. Replaced some fogged up lights on our 2006 XC90.  Installation is so very easy (aside from the snug fit) that it can be done in as little as 5-10 min.
B000IY6RW8|5|A great replacement for my worn out one.
B0031I4HL6|5|Perfect fit, real deal.  These rotors are the real deal and fit perfectly.  No rust on them what-so-ever.
B00NG2IRB8|5|Perfect fit at the right price.
B00E8IWO7C|5|Great sticker! larger than I imagined it to be, but the dimensions listed are correct. Nerdiness at its finest!
B000GOHUS0|5|Perfect fit with a bit of minor adjustment for Australian right hand drive. Cheers
B002G47GE6|5|Perfect fit and operation.
B000COBCF6|1|Did not fit at all. Had to be modified completely.
B008FCE7ZO|1|Buyer beware. This kit does NOT come with the c-channel metal inserts that are required to lock the the cross rails in place. The picture shown is INCOMPLETE!!!! Now shopping for the inserts at an additional cost of $100.00
B000CD5QCW|4|the thread on one of the shocks had a barb in it which caused the nut to cross thread. Only noticed this AFTER is was installed. Lucky I had a tool that corrected the threading and 20 minutes later was able to thread the nut on correctly. Suggest checking threads before installation
B003TPYEZU|5|Unfortunately I bought the wrong item but the product came in good and seller performed with excellence
B000NW6X8I|5|Great OEM replacement.
B00EQ26FPW|5|Fit the wheels I have nice, and snug, can't tell the difference from OEM
B000R4QT2W|5|Exact replacement for the socket in my Hurricane deck boat. Decent quality for the price.
B00A7EPBSK|5|USPS lost my order (shocking, right?). Power Gear Motor sports did the right thing and notified me by email of this problem and have already shipped me a new one. This is what proper customer service is.
B009UKUURO|5|Small but powerful! This buffer will get the job done quick and is still small enough to handle. Also given the size it is easier to avoid over heating the paint in one area. Im using their different pads with aftermarket compounds and Im having zero issues. I bought the 25' corded one and Im happy that I dont need to drag the &#34;twisted plugs&#34; across my car.
B0081KZJAM|2|It's alot shorter than I expected. From all the reviews I expected it to be too big for my newer Corolla. Long wise it fits fine, not flat, but I didnt expect it to. However, it isn't tall enough, there is space on the top about 2-3 inches where the sun can come in. Trying it today and hopefully it still works alright.  UPDATE: It SEEMS to help better than the other one I had that was the cheap roll up kind. But still very unhappy with the length.
B003G0Q5MI|5|Awesome! Fits perfectly my 2013 Toyota Prius!
B005GEI30O|5|Exactly what I was needing.  Fast delivery.  Thank you very much.
B00FFC880M|5|Great suspension, same performance as the &#34;legit&#34; brands entry level coil overs for half the cost. Don't let the forum people sneering at &#34;Ricelands&#34; fool you, they're more than worth the 300 bucks and give you a nice drop while riding better than stock. No reason not to get these when you can't even buy replacement shocks for the price!
B00MC7H3LS|5|Very bright.  They look kinda cool inside my turn signal slots too.  I have these on an '06 Accord as the rear turn signals, and they work very well.  You will need resistors to deal with hyper flash if you're using these as turn signals.  If you've got plenty of space inside whatever light fixture you're replacing (these are fairly long bulbs), then you should be just fine with these.
B000CSPFWS|5|Excellent factory replacement.
B000C59N7Y|5|Greatly improved the ride on my '01 V70. Not a performance strut, but a good basic replacement for the original.
B0029TQDLA|5|Great
B00AAGOT92|1|It is the wrong one I need to exchange it
B00JAXV29G|5|I have the Wet Okole covers for my front two seats and decided to try the CalTrend for my middle row based upon the reviews and the price.  I was not disappointed.  The covers are thicker, in my opinion, than the WO covers.  It was super easy to install and the fit is perfect.  If your looking for a cheaper alternative to the WO covers, this one fits the bill!
B007AKF8GY|5|Just what I needed because the top connector of my remote broke. This works great!
B0002NYE1G|1|Had problems with one of them I bought. Manufacturers warrenty isn't good if purchased on Amazon as they aren't a approved dealer they linken . Amazon has returned the product at there cost but I'm not buying any other of this brand
B00G23NN0S|5|Great!
B00KTHY91K|5|It was the right remote for my car and was very easy to install!
B001KS0M5E|5|Perfect fit on my 2007 HHR for the rear window! If you have a Chevy HHR I would recommend these they work great and look like the stock one did.
B006ZM5HY6|5|Awesome - Perfect fit and really well made.  Removal for my application could be easier as I have  a 10&#34;+ lift and I have them down more at and angle and I have to remove one side in order to remove the quick disconnect and remove them.  Not super hard to do, but not as easy if I had a standard size truck.  They do work really well and I would buy another pair if I ever needed them.
B00PCNIPBG|3|Ok for round town carting of the kayak. I would not feel comfortable traveling long distance with this set up.
B005VIP4TS|5|Light was delivered quickly and was a direct replacement for the stock light.
B006P89J8U|4|Patch for my motorcycle vest.  Love what it stands for.
B00F4MQJ5O|3|I put this on my 2007 wrangler and when I traded my 2007 Sport for a 2015 Rubicon I just left the light bar on it and let it go. It is noisy as hell and in the rainy season takes in a lot of moisture and condensation. The condensation is easy enough to deal with as others have pointed out, but the travel noise is what killed it for me. Otherwise, if your looking to barbie up your road princess for cheap this is what your looking for. It looks great, but in a few months you may grow tired of the noise.
B000XBBISO|5|It is just a replacement, nothing special.
B007V2CN1O|5|great sun shield keeps the truck cooler, can be a little tricky to install since the panels are rigid
B00TZ8HT5M|5|Put it on my fire helmet looks awsome
B00CA91AIK|5|Happily replaced the HF one of the same diameter - except this one actually works.
B000IYT450|5|So far so good, working like it should
B001DKUTR0|5|They work great.
B00Q6EXKJM|5|Fast deliver and everything I espected
B00TY4XJ7E|5|Nice sticker quality
B00JQ6IJXO|2|Trouble  with this bolt holes
B008BE02GO|3|Not as bright as a thought
B00E9D4NES|2|Does not fit 2014 cruze emblems
B000C5A0A8|5|I haven't installed it yet.  Local Auto Supply stores do not stock.  I will keep it for when I replace a strut.  I have purchased this item before and it works great
B00SYVH7U8|5|Arrived before shipping date, great !
B005J6JRMM|1|They didn't work, i had trouble with the site figuring out the specifications, the sizes are listed in metric (last time i checked this is the US)<br /><br />i have 2 extenders that are of no use to me, I re-order the size that fits, so I am out $20.00
B00RJKB2FQ|5|sturdy and inexpensive
B00QS08XJG|5|I Love it use it to Clean my bike
B00B1CKIDA|5|Looks great and is holding up well.
B000CAYT96|5|it was what they said it was.  Fit was OEM
B000C9QZ62|5|perfect fit for 02 Chevy venture
B001GF3NV6|5|Perfect!  We use a large rubber band to help the velcro keep it closed.  The size, configuration, and material were all perfect.
B008N2JLRU|5|Perfect fit for 2012 Sonata.  And considerably less than buying from teh Dealership.
B000FI9V34|5|Love it
B00ICPGVMG|5|Price was right and delivery was swift and no damage.
B000VKTUD2|5|Easy as pie to install
B00K17A2E6|5|satisfied
B008AM1Q8K|5|Always faithful
B0002BGELQ|5|satisfied
B000QFORQW|5|everything as expected
B00CEPV8TQ|5|These work great, no problems.  10 minute install.
B00KWDYSVW|5|Great product
B007HRXQ64|5|Returned but it is made to fit the Road-Master Steering Stabilizer, which I returned also. No defects on this. What can one say about a bracket made specially for another part by the same company. I had just found a way to fix my own. But there seemed nothing wrong with this. Amazon Customer Service took care of this return promptly. I do not expect this to help anyone, just want to clear it off my list. If you buy their Stabilizer you will need this part to mount it if you have a certain vehicle, if not you will need another type of bracket.
B001G7IY5Y|5|Perfect fit...fast shipping
B00WTCQAQU|5|Great quality, I loved the free key chain.
B001C6Q852|5|Love it, fresh new and works!
B001RM9ZDS|5|Great set of wires. Easy install, perfect length. Numbered clearly. High visibility was nice to have for the install.
B003CKH3Y6|5|Delivered quickly. Fit perfectly on my 06 Polaris Sportsman 800. No complaints!
B00CJFLOJU|5|Worked perfectly in my 2011 328i
B00B1F0INW|4|Very easy to set up, take down, and move out of the way.  Every Rav 4 or other SUV should have them as standard equipment.
B00FH8P1DG|5|Bright and worked well, good price and fast delivery.
B006WQSD1O|5|fits perfect easy to instal Than you
B00UIV1VV8|3|They were good lights and worked well.  However, the lights I replaced were also my daytime running lights which would not work.  I called and asked if there was a work around and there was not.  I was told to take the fuse out to disable the daytime running lights.  When I did this it turned a light on in my dash.  Not really the lights that were the issue but more of the vehicle.  I would not hesitate to buy the product in the future, just did not work out for me this time.
B00QXADIV4|5|good
B00GSAUHB8|5|Awesome product, very easy to set up and take down in the car. It is very compact when folded up so it is easy to stow away when not in use.
B00032K32A|5|Very useful
B00L2T19QW|5|Just as advertised.
B001AMEEPO|2|Needed about a one inch lift. Shocks provided that and so far have worked just fine.
B001AJH1HK|4|The only mirror set I could find that fits a Toyota Tacoma. Easy to mount and very little vibration. I like them.
B00Z3CMPAI|5|great
B005ZWE0NG|4|Price was a bit steep but product was great
B00NJ008MI|5|Fast delivery fit perfect
B00HJVEWVG|5|I have been using this since 1996. Just recently did an engine flush and added another 4 cylinder bottle to my toyota paseo, I will always use this product.
B000YPKUFQ|4|THE BEARINGS WERE OF CORRECT FITTMENT, HAVING TROUBLE W/ONE OF THEM SEALING CORRECTLY? DIDN'TAPPRECIATE BEING ARBITRARILY SIGHNED UP FOR $99 (FREE?) shipping-thought that was a very sneaky way of getting an interest free loan, which, resulted in an overdraft before I caught it! Maybe you could explain (PRIME) a bit more thoroughly in the future, instead of just slipping it in. I was credited for the $99 & the overdraft (which I appreciate) when I called to inquire. On further investigation, I'm told it is actually a very good deal if I do much business with you. Maybe when I get to the point of buying in bigger volume, I will be more inclined to WILLINGLY/ KNOWINGLY sign up for it . Caveat emptor- I know, Thank you for the service & quality that I DID receive, till next time, Mike Thomas
B00I548REE|5|Look great. Easy installation.
B003K5S4NW|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B000CPZWWY|1|Supposed to fit my 69 cutlass. It did not. To short. Not worth paying the postage to send back. I'll just have to eat it.
B00OC90BR2|2|Only one frame came you have two plates and only one frame
B005ADY8V4|5|Great quality product, worked perfectly!
B00BE5IOL2|1|Not to hard to install, but the brass bolt they use on the lock tang broke off with very little effort.
B004HCM9H4|5|In my 50 years of detailing cars and airplanes, I find this to be the longest lasting wax that I have ever used. The shine is brilliant and bugs & tar come off with ease. The only small drawback is that you can only apply and polish out sections at a time rather that doing the whole vehicle at once, but it's worth the little extra trouble.
B001KSEIJ0|5|Awesome product
B007Q11P6E|5|ABS light was on my son's 04 Monte Carlo replaced the sensor with this and install was real easy no snags exact match and perfect fit, can't beat the price
B009EK7WDU|5|Works great so far.
B00ZQ36VJK|5|Better than OEM !!
B008E06V4M|5|I like and I love
B006YU7G8E|5|Works.
B004SKU26A|5|Thanks
B00269504E|5|Very easy to install and they work great.
B00I6MSZ4M|5|Fits 2002 TJ  used only one screw from factory mount, shaved the plastic placement or guide peg off of the new mount.
B007YMNQ6W|5|This kit saved me a fortune.... Worked great. Thanks!
B00651C998|3|Shipped quickly. Good quality. Sporty look. Reception is not as good as the factory antenna. I put a dab of Noalox on the threads hoping for a little better connection continuity. This seemed to help a little. The &#34;major&#34; stations seem to come in decently, but some of the less powerful stations fade in and out. I love the look. Definitely cool, so I will probably keep it on my 2011 Tundra. Always the I-pod option for better quality audio.
B000BQWLE6|5|excellent, if you have specific questions please feel free to email me.
B00M04KNDI|5|Worked perfect. Programmed effortlessly at dealership
B00RW7W7G4|5|I was a bit hesitant to purchase a new brand of wiper blades, as I normally use Bosch, but this pair of wiper blades is great. Not only do these look as good, if not better than the Bosch, but they work excellent in wet conditions. I was out driving in a storm the night after I installed these and got to put them to the test, in which I was very impressed with them. These are well worth the price!
B00BBJTEE2|5|Perfect!!! Thank u
B00L9R0K5I|5|I was skeptical to purchase off-brand floor mats from anyone other than Jeep for my 2011 Compass, but I love these! They are a true fit and look great. We had a lot of snow in the past winter and the mats prevented any liquid from getting through to the carpeting!
B00J5WF8P6|5|Timely and as advertised.
B009F7UE0K|5|Love the backpack. Fits my helmet, goggles, tearoffs, and gloves. Not to heavy, doesn't have a lot of padding but will keep the helmet from getting scratched between races.
B0066TKGAI|5|Timely and as advertised.
B000UVENVG|5|Excellent.
B001AWU6KQ|5|perfect fight and feel light years above the stock grips for sturdiness.
B0090UN116|5|Ordered this kit and installed it with no problems. LEDs are super bright and great looking. About a month into owning the kit, I lost the remote due for the lights so I emailed the seller asking for a replacement remote and he refunded me my money to buy an entire new kit to use the module/remote. Great customer service and will definitely buy again from this seller.
B005G5RSB8|5|So far the batteries work great.
B00B2AF00M|4|Great product that did the job to get my steering geometry almost back to stock. This item say it is for a 4.5&#34; lift but I am running a 5.5&#34; lift and it works just fine.
B00125686W|1|Don't be caught by the offered features. In few days the system will stop working. Do not buy it
B00B3D053K|5|Looks great under my skateboard.<br />Is made of vinyl, sticks on well.
B005RSZMUS|4|I bought two for my 2005 Ford Expedition and am generally pleased.  The rubber straps seem to be aging quickly developing cracks due to sun exposure, so i don't know yet how many uses I am going to get.  The format of my right mirror housing makes it necessary I connect the rubber straps first and sort of slide the tow mirror on over the mirror housing, but once I figured that out I'm good.  It's unfortunate that I see no one has yet designed a slip over mirror specifically for my Expedition, but this will work just fine.
B00HS2J5AO|4|While it is true that this cargo cover does not provide the complete coverage that the cover in my recent 4Runner did, this is very adequate. I too miss the flaps that filled the gap between the tension rod and the rear seats, but if you recline the second-row seats (I have the  XLE trim) then it is very difficult to see what is stored under the cover. I love that the cover fits into a compartment under the cargo area behind the third row seats. If you don't need the cover, it stores out of the way, but remains in the vehicle in case you need it later. No taking it out and leaving it at home. Pretty cool! (Note: if you use the third row seating, you can not use the cargo cover. Likewise, if you have the second row seats folded down, this cover will not conceal the entire cargo area.) The beige cargo cover perfectly matches the interior of the car. The cargo area is very well concealed, except for the aforementioned small gap behind the second row seats.
B00XQML9G8|5|could have included a little longer foam seal but worked good
B005BTBI4W|1|I ordered 3 and they came separate.
B000BZEHOO|5|Excellent high-quality product and thank you for the fast shipping...!
B00B1AKQ3O|1|The tape was not sufficient to hold the tabs in the window track. Had to purchase new 3M tape to cover tabs.
B00LNGUW2Q|5|Used it to connect d-fly appendage on my dura ace di2 system. No issues here
B003YK96RQ|4|I installed this item on my 2008 Chevy Silverado 2500 HD.  The installation went well and the instructions were easy to follow.  However, the instruction indicated it should be installed without using either of the spacers included with the product.  When installed without either of them on my truck the step would slam into the end of the leaf spring where it attaches to the frame.  In order to avoid this I ended up having to use the large spacer.  The only problem with that is it means the step is 3 inches lower to the ground and therefore not as effective as I would have wished helping me step into the bed of the truck.  Other than that, so far so good.
B00HR26TOU|3|Nice light but I expect it clearest light
B00GB8614E|5|Very happy with them
B005BFM0AC|5|Got a Honda? Use this.
B000IG20S6|5|This product stopped by vehicle from using 1qt of oil every 500 miles to using no oil at! It is a great product
B00BAZBWTM|4|The Good:<br />These are cheap, and they fit, and they work.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />These are cheap and super dim<br /><br />----------<br />These bulbs are super dim....I might start driving around with my high beams on.  But I don't feel like I can complain too much because....dang....they are sooooo cheap.  If they had the same brightness as the oem bulbs or what I can get at the big box auto store for 4 times the price I would give 5 starts.
B0084UJJH8|5|Fits perfectly excellent product
B00GB8600O|5|Awsome lights ! Just what i needed.
B0085CH1RU|5|Item as describe, fast ship!
B008KQLDFC|4|Had to re-glue throttle sleeve, other than that they're awesome!
B001B7TSP4|5|Quality product, just as pictured. I bought two  one was damaged in shipment and was replaced quickly. I like these units for my work
B00IKKS4W8|5|Great replacement jack for my RV.
B002VY0PMQ|5|Love this tape, though I don't use it for it's intended purpose.  I'm a violin teacher and use this as finger tapes for my beginning students.  Comes in fun colors and doesn't leave any residue on expensive instruments!
B008VLVDII|5|Easy on & off to put down rear seats when needed, dirt and dog hair brush right off.
B008EF2E5W|1|I chose this on Amazon over other LED's assuming the construction might be better based on the pictures.  I used these to replace the rear driving lights in my Prius, and after only 1 week of use, both bulbs have sections of LED's that flicker on and off.  Areas of the bulb are showing evidence of rust already, so they probably didn't even clean up the flux after soldering the board.  This product is pure crap.
B00KLZ65GM|3|A little thin for cold weather use, but fits well
B00DE3MGXO|5|Looks good in Rav and covers fit good
B000CM2VIK|5|perfect fit
B00NPUZCLE|2|Great looking product.  Just didn't fit our 2015 Polaris Desert Edition. The A arms are curved on our model.
B005I60VZK|5|Able to program myself in a few minutes, saved A LOT of money.
B00DZUCPXW|5|These work perfectly.  NGood quality.
B000C5BVYM|5|was ok
B001G7HDMO|5|My poor, adorable 2001 VW Beetle - this was the first of many parts I have purchased for my adorable but troubled car in the past year and a half. The part works great (this breather hose is specifically for the AWV engine not the APH engine is you have a 2001 - this is VERY important info!!!).<br />The car not so much.
B001O99GC4|1|I received these and they looked like good replacement rotors. I have had them a couple of months and they are the wrong size. they are way too small for my Audi S$. I used the tool to check and got the green tick mark saying they were for my car. now I can no longer return them as it is over 30 days. this sucks and I'm out hundreds of dollars!
B004ERQS42|4|I like the fabric but it doesn't want to stay in place because there is nothing holding it in place on the sides.  I am glad I purchased it, though.  Before getting it, my light fabric car seat was getting discolored by the dye in dark blue jeans.
B0068ERP64|5|5 stars
B000A8OW9M|5|Helped to settle out the idle of a Sears Craftsman riding mower with the large 420cc Powermore engine.  Those things shipped with a Chinese made &#34;Torch&#34; brand spark plug.
B007XWD4O2|5|Love it perfect
B01120RQ62|5|This pair of equipment is seamless i like them very much.I recently added this to my new Honda bike they are perfect and very handy piece of equipment.This yellow color was a perfect match to my bike.Thanks to this seller my bike is complete and amazing like never before.
B00IBOM19U|5|Very nice! They fit perfectly and look good!
B003V57NUQ|4|These are decent for the money spent. They're advertised as universal but the fit on my Rhino Rack Aero is pretty sketchy. There's no way to bend or change the bottom plate to make them fit well.  Having said that, I also have NOT had any issues with them being loose or not working well. They come with picture instructions that are simple enough to understand. If you can put together anything from Ikea, these aren't bad at all.<br /><br />My only problem is that the smooth bolts don't press through the plastic cushion well enough to lock into the bar itself. That makes tightening the bolts a bit of a problem. I used a ball peen hammer to gently tap them in until they were set properly and locked into place. Then, there were no issues at all. I've seen people say they take forever to put together, but I got 4 together in just under an hour with no real issues.<br /><br />The straps that come with them are functional. They don't feel very strong like better quality straps do, but they will do the job just fine. There is a cheap flap of nylon that covers the bottom of the cam buckle to keep it from scratching whatever you're holding down. Considering the price of the overall purchase, I had no issues with them. They were just a perk and I use them for less critical functions and use my higher quality straps for the critical holds.
B00BD4SO7I|1|Did not fit my seats at all!  Had the hardest time putting them on!  Would not recommend at all!
B008RO3DHI|5|This came wrapped in heavy poly wrap that was see through but no big issue. After reading the reviews, we were worried that it would fall off due to the clips as others mentioned.  So we reinforced the clips with using plastic ties and have no issues what so ever.  Very pleased how it looks as it looks the the VW on the other side. For the money, I highly recommend the product and seller..
B001J83FJ0|5|work great
B0027UMXEM|3|The mounting plate required the superwinch to be mounted upside down on the rubicon, which is not recommended by the company.  The plate should either had an attachment so the winch can be mounted right side up. Or the winch company needs to have monting screw holes in the top of the winch as well as the bottom.
B0034NKDKC|4|Nice helmet for the price.
B00LMJ50FI|5|Great set. Everything you need.
B000PEZ1L4|4|good special purpose caulking
B00Z3NH7BO|5|Love this thing. Fits perfect, lets in more air and sunlight then I thought it would but gives perfect amount of shade to keep you from burning up. A little noise on highway but nothing bad. The main reason I went with this cover is it can stay on when you put your soft top back on. No reason to take on and off every time you take the top down.
B001UG8S8O|5|Glad to share in a Trekkie
B001GEYXPW|4|Works good, Caused too much vibration for me though
B0009I0DDW|3|It had some rip in the cover after the first winters use
B007RVR1MA|5|These work better than new !  Always change both together.  Fast shipping !
B00EQGDW7C|3|cheap construction not durable weekend warrior grade
B0002S9YL6|2|I like the color and pad, but the light did NOT work.  Defective product.
B001A0SEOS|5|I used to move the rear view mirror so I could see her but this is much better (and safer I'm sure).  Not as clear as the rear view mirror but good enough to know what she's doing without turning around.
B00RCEJQV6|5|They are stem covers. What can possibly be wrong ??
B00GHRUQEK|5|Great grommet.
B000TYOS3C|5|Easy to install
B00K67X3KG|5|Just what I needed.
B0014AQOCS|5|Excelent
B00BLUZDJ6|4|I did replace the air compressor July of 2013 on our 2003 Suburban LT. The replacement was very easy, exact fit, no problems. July 2015 pump went out, but I have determined that the shocks are also leaking and may be the cause of the pump failure - due to excessive activation. Now looking to purchase new shocks and pump again.<br /><br />Highly recommend replacing shocks and compressor at same time if failure is present and vehicle is old. I live in Minnesota so the winter salt does not help any of the suspension components!
B004W97CNS|5|These lights really make my white silverado pop!! Fast delivery, packaged well, and super easy to install!! will use this seller again!! thanks td
B003CSYPLC|3|having to have two orders shipped to me, that were wrong and having to rob parts from one to make the other work, was very nerve racking to say the least. And draw-tite's idea of a magnetic cover...pathetic!!! ( you could barely call that thing a fridge magnet) .The hitch its self seems to be fine.
B00L844VUM|1|Screw broke when I was trying to adjust them the first time. I won't even install them now since one light will not even work.
B00BJLLGZW|5|A little difficult to attach at first, but overall I am happy.  Looks great and gives you extra storage.
B00IO4EYMY|4|a good buy
B00E3W7OKU|5|Perfect fit and easy to install, just drop it right in
B00D953ULE|5|Great price for these...work perfect.
B00KTJ0LRE|5|Worked very well once we were able to program it.  The directions were not clear for our model, but through trial & error and the vehicle owners manual we had success.  Would recommend using a lock smith to cut the key.
B000YE19HU|1|Not sure why this item failed. I ordered the exact same part number the repairs center installed on the RH side of mt Suburban.  Yet this bearing assy failed first.  Yes it was cheaper but now i have to replace.. not good.
B00Y5M9LD6|1|Wrong type for this 2010 Yukon
B009NTFEUK|5|product was what i hoped it would be
B00NY4LWSI|5|Works as said and looks great on the truck
B00009WC2N|5|great
B002T4U3Q6|5|Fits my 2014 Grizzly 700 perfectly using the factory bolts. Works very well.
B00ER0RIB8|5|Excellent.
B0002Z9L8K|4|Not real bright but i just bought this on an impulse because of JP 1
B006QH56GO|5|Great battery!
B00BLAG3D6|2|First, the good. This light is very bright. Moved traffic no problem even in daylight. It held the pattern I had selected for the week I had it so can't comment on long term in that regard.<br /><br />Unfortunately that's where the good ends. This light is just not durable. As another review stated, it melted and warped after only a few hours in a hot car with outside temps about 95 degrees. The second day, temp of 90, it warped even more, causing the clips that hold the light into the &#34;hood/light shroud&#34; to fail, making it sit back out of the shroud and angling it up slightly. 3rd day, temps of 85, it STILL warped more, and I decided to return it then. The polymer used is really thin which led to the warping.<br /><br />Other notes on it. Plug never overheated on me as someone else pointed out. I had it plugged in the whole time so no issue for me on that. Cord is long, I didn't measure but I'd say about 7-8 feet maybe. I can't comment much on the bracket because there is not enough adjustment available to be able to use it in my car (2015 Honda CR-V) but I used industrial Velcro to secure to the dash and it fit in well until all the warping started.<br /><br />I still gave it 2 stars because of the cost, the fact it did function well electronically, and was bright. I guess if you live in a cold climate year round it would be good. I live in NY and its summer and that didn't cut it, so any southern climates would be no good unless you always park in the shade. Like I said, I returned it and ordered a smaller light on here for 50$ that is much more durable and just as bright even being only 4 large LEDs. That one only had 5 reviews, took the chance, and love it. I don't think I'm allowed to post the brand on another products review but I provided enough info to figure it out.
B000I04Z7Q|5|Fast delivery and very good product. Took awhile to instal in my dodge avwnger but happy with the results.
B00QN8EV08|5|Sent it to my sister who has TWO BLACK PUGS!
B000A835AY|5|Both products work perfectly. Used to use the spray version. Decided to give the sheets a try and they seem to work better than the spray... or maybe my car just happened to be dirtier this time?  Either way, the cleaners worked! Wish there were more than 25 sheets though.
B00S4OK8VA|1|the sticker must have been a year or more old. There was no way for me to peel it off. When something finally came off it was rip. will never purchase from them. I hope someone listen to this review and saves their money.
B005JYYKN0|5|Fits, works, and cheap price. Showed up on time.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|Excelent
B00BTLEIIY|2|Doesn't fit the Nissan Armada. These are one piece seat covers. They will never look factory because you can't get them to tuck properly where the back and bottom of the seat meet. Unfortunate, because they look like nice covers.
B00D9C2CDO|4|Worked well on our 1000 mile drive to FL.  It didn't rain so I can't attest to the water proofness of it, but it was well designed, and easy to use.
B001PNCKV8|5|Exact fit.... worked great on my 98 Wrangler.  I could not believe it but seems to run faster now.
B00I9TNJMU|1|Have to get a new set of lights these are not bright enough and one light barely works now bad product.
B00J3NPOM4|5|Perfect
B008QR1ASK|5|The towels were exactly what I was looking for and needed. And a great price too. I use them to buff when waxing my car and clean the interior. They do exactly as I need and leave no streaks, marks, lint or anything like that. When I need more I'll definitely be back here to order them. Thanks!
B0035AMPFK|5|Very good snatch block at a great price. Will recommend to my buddies
B001KQD7YE|5|so far so good!
B0006301W8|4|Lubrication  good film itself isnot good for all surfaces....some cracks on plexiglass on sailboat windows......awesome as installed last year....but 2015 windows suck
B00CFBVAX8|5|Great product
B00WH6ZH0S|5|works perfect and it was a timely delivery..
B00N4GZ8NQ|5|These are very good quality mirrors.  When I started researching I found what appear to be exactly the same mirrors with many different names and prices.  I finally bought the cheapest version I could find with the features I needed and they're great.  They are easy to install, are very solid with no vibration when hitting bumps, the detent mechanism is solid and works well, and they mount up well.  They are equal in quality to the original equipment mirrors.  These are great mirrors; buy them.
B004J9FBV6|1|does not fit......  The fuel intel runs into a bracket and can not be installed.
B00IS93EW6|5|I love these fairly easy to install i used an angle grinder with a cutting wheel and was a breeze
B005IHAPBY|5|Heavy built, solid nice well made . looks really good and the black covers just set it off . Worked well with my clear plastic plate cover too.
B00G2TV7OG|5|I love these lights, we have converted two cars with these, they are brighter and more noticeable and last longer than the incandescence they replaced.
B004I1768G|5|perfect fit and timely delivery
B00JIIZCM6|4|Worked well on my leather couch, purse, and ottoman.  Love that it comes with it's own microfiber cloth that's bright yellow, so I know what it's for.  My leather goods looked great after cleaning with this product.
B00YTZ9EEK|1|REALLY WEAK CHAIN. tensioner also poorly made the hardware for the rear sprocket can barely do the job before the bolts snap. Lots of weak metal motor mounts are also extremely weak
B0015PMZMU|4|I used this to build some new choke tubes for my truck.  Makes a really nice flare.
B00M78820I|5|“ I'm very pleased with it! Fits my Santa Fe perfectly! ”
B00RUPDZRS|4|product is ok
B00EBQJA78|5|nice on my Benz
B00SYGN55E|5|Awesome muffler ...I researched and shopped around and amazon was the best price ..... but this thing rocks !! I had the single to dual super 40's and it had too much of the high aggressive sound so I opted to go with the deep and rich sound of the 44&#34;s when i converted to true dual. my only regret is not putting in the X pipe off the bat but no worries i have one on the way !! Oh and don't forget to shop online for some high flow cats as well then you will be smiling like a kid in a candy shop :)
B002OUMVZG|5|Great product over all.  Used for over a year and zero issues
B005GYDBNS|5|Put more than 10,000 miles on this filter. Stayed strong, and kept my engine healthy all the way. Great fit for 2008 honda accord.
B000C9Q1WA|5|Great purchase
B000CNAOM4|5|Perfect fit.
B008BTLIYY|5|Fit my 1988 Electra Glide perfectly and it hold the charge very well without the need to trickle charge in between.
B0006SH4PA|5|Not a professional detailer but I wanted a water based dressing for my new tires and this not only saves me $ on buying the individual tire shine bottles but I can dilute it to my preference, I like the satin finish (3:1 ratio). I like how it's not greasy and I have had good results on duration.
B00OUDSTEW|5|Excelent
B002T4FICU|5|In defense of seller, no struts come with the slot for the brake line, not even oem. They expect you to separate the line, insert it through the opening and reattach, obviously bleeding the line afterwards. It's a stupid design error. . You have to cut the mount to remove it, no slot.<br />As a result one always notches the mount with a dremel type tool and uses the clip to secure. it or even zip ties
B004JQ0RWW|5|perfect
B000E5U3XU|1|I HAVE A FILTER THAT I ORDERED FROM JC WHITNEY CTALOG.  THIS FILTER DOESN.T LOOK LIKE THAT ONE.  I WILL TRY IT AND HOPE FOR THE BEST
B001GH3QSO|5|Did exactly what it says
B003BNJZE0|5|Needed this part change to prevent switch from sticking causing motor points to melt.
B00498MT12|5|The item was as advertised & a perfect fit for my ladyfriend's Hyundai Elantra. It arrived a day earlier than expected.
B00029WYVW|5|Great buy fast shipping
B007RKMV12|5|just what I wanted, been looking for exactly this for a while
B000COVO6S|5|have ngk iridum plugs, these work perfect
B000C947EY|5|Exactly what I needed
B0053ODFZU|5|Great would reccommend
B00N1QEHS6|1|I want to return it. Wasn't what I needed.
B001S3IW1C|4|This cover is worth every penny.  I tested it out on one of the hottest days of the year parked in full sun -- in south Louisiana.  After a few hours, the temperature inside read 107 degF.  Normally you would be able to cook an egg on the dashboard.  Now I won't have to park under trees where birds lay waste to my car's exterior.  Edit:  I had to knock off a star.  Anything more than a gentle breeze will cause the flap to come out from under the windshield wipers.
B000B8YDUY|5|WOW no more squeaky breaks! use as it say's and it is amazing!
B00TP14MTU|5|Great----I was even more impressed that the key I have for locking any and all compartments for my motorhome worked for the new handle that I purchased.
B00ZTRWQ9W|5|I decided to purchase the Gosiin car jump starter kit for a variety of reasons but mainly for emergency purposes and so I wouldnt need to rely on others (sometimes it would be people you do not know) to help in case of a dead battery. I can now take my jumper cables out (which take up a lot of space) and put this small organized case/kit in their place and have more room. I like the fact that you can chose different voltages and that it comes with a variety of accessories (charging tips for a laptop and cables for other gps units, smartphones and tablets) so that you can charge your portable devices. It also can be used as a flash light (high mode) or as a emergency light (flashing strobe mode or SOS mode). I have bought 1 other Gosin device before and its quality was good so I wasnt worried purchasing this unit with no reviews, especially in that it comes with an 18 months warranty.
B0062WC9IQ|5|Fast delivery and no surprises!!
B007J3DJZ4|5|Love it. Exactly what you see is what you get!
B00QZACV9C|1|Purchased this starter clutch, did not go together well, locked up and instantly destroyed itself, parts are not machined to correct specs. My mechanic also bought one after this brand new one failed and it also failed within minutes.
B007PMY3MM|3|looks cool
B0081SC1Z0|5|it is excellent for the price.
B0002Q7ZLO|5|Solved my problem with a uhaul wiring kit, hooked this up and all my lights worked on the cheap diy Harbor Freight trailer! Read horror stories about harbor freight trailer lights not working, this fixed it as it plugs right into the lights. Easy install and made well, thanks for saving my sanity.
B000N37E94|5|Great do it yourself tool for fuel lines.
B00O46ZO02|1|Terribly disappointed in this Hitch.  We had just finished a 1200 mile round trip mostly interstate with a 6600 camper and we pulled into a cul de sac to turn around in front of our home.  Turning around caused the piece that holds the trunnion bars to the trailer to bend and the little &#34;L&#34; piece bent and twisted too.  Keep in mind this was not a high speed maneuver,  this was at a bit more than idle,  just driving in a circle.  I've contacted the seller to find out about replacement or refund. This hitch is rated up to 10000 lbs so I'm not sure what the issue with this is,  but I'm clearly not satisfied.  I will update once we get it resolved with seller.
B001C6N7BU|5|While installing this item on my 1998 Dodge Ram 2500 was a little tough, it was WELL WORTH the $400 savings a mechanic was going to charge me for the same fix.  I found videos on YouTube to help me with the installation.
B00X5FJ9A4|1|Didn't work. I'm going to have to make adjustments to the internal parts because the battery post/ contacts, don't mate up
B00I8IJC28|4|This is a visual review only of Ecogard S5608. I can't test for manufacturer claims. Filter end cap says made in China. Claimed efficiency stated on the box is 99.9% at 25 microns. 2X more filter capacity claimed over conventional filters. The stiff pleats are exceptionally evenly spaced. End caps are securely bonded to filter material. The total filter length and the media are over 1mm longer than comparable AC Delco, plus 2 more folds. I believe this results in about 5% more surface area exposed to circulation. Now a 78% price increase?? Hmmm.
B001CEG90I|5|very cheap, Overall a great product for its price.
B00DV6TWTK|1|It broke
B00FOH4AUK|5|This 4 D fiber wrap was Awesome!!! It was very easy to apply with a hairdryer and I have received numerous complements. I would recommend this product.
B00474OG0K|4|Yay no overheated engine
B009IPAP8U|5|So far working as it should. Color is indeed the 4300k.
B00NOAJK1S|5|Super bright and looks super fresh
B004A2BCWY|5|A very high quality well made Ford OEM oil filter at a terrific price! Protects your warranty using factory OEM parts. I've tried them all and cannot go wrong with these! They work well up to 7500 mis of service with recommended Motorcraft Synthetic blend oil or full synthetic oils of your choice!
B008JORKP2|5|This little fire pit is so nice, throws off a lot of heat on low as well as higher flames. You can roast hot dogs, make marshmallows for smores, and all safe without worries about fire dangers. We've had burn bans almost this whole summer due to drought conditions, so campfires are not an option. These little guys will be the only way you're going to have campfires, everyone who camps needs to get one. You won't regret it. Plus you don't have to duck the smoke while sitting around the campfire!
B00FDNNZJM|5|nice housing
B0081GSTOO|5|excellent service and product as expected
B00JL7Y8MY|5|fit perfect fast shipping
B00QMWQOHS|4|Good floor mats and fit well
B008CE09PM|5|very handy for hauling bike rack and boat at the same time
B005EYM4JC|5|Super light weight! Strong cca, and does well after sitting for 6weeks+ No charger. My zx14 was down for repairs for the last month and half with the battery connected. I never bought the shorai charger, but luckily it fired right up without hesitation!
B003SZKOBO|5|Prompt delivery and excellent fit
B009IPQ0U2|5|Fast n great
B0089AKQIO|5|Looks good and no wind noise. Replaced my old cracking rubber one.
B0002STS2Q|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00EZV2RRE|1|I never ever had this happen to me with any other HID kit,I have a 2015 Honda fit,  with this kit installed my car kept shutting down, so I had to remove the kit, sorry to say but this kit is junk, and I do not recommend anybody by this kit .
B00ISY51KO|5|Exactly what I need. Thanks
B008XN7NUG|1|they are good for one year only after a year start work slow then they freeze,and called authel they asking 750 dollar to reprogram the scanner.
B000XBJ91M|1|It has got to be the worst shipping I have ever had in my entire life slow and then they break up my order only get 2 out of 8
B0045K2Q9Y|5|They're cheap.  They work.  Keep this in my trunk now.
B002M4C6Q8|5|As stated
B003721C7S|4|fits fine, works like advertised
B00390VEH6|5|Nice product. Fast delivery. Thanks
B00ABW6DO4|5|Fits perfectly well in my 2013 Ford Fusion SE. Now my car is so much easier to maintain! This was worth the purchase
B00SX5RSA4|4|same the ones of auto parts no much dif. not bad quality at all.
B000A8JNF0|5|Have used this product several times and am always pleased with the results.
B00SXIQP4G|5|Worked really well!  I like the 4 port design so I could have the vacuum pump clear out the line to the R134a can as well, before filling the system. Knobs, gauges, and connectors all worked well.  I did need an adapter to connect to my vacuum pump.  The black hose is 3/16&#34;-18 fitting with an o-ring, so I used a 3/8&#34;-18 flare fitting to the vacuum pump.
B00M7DP634|5|GOOD QUALITY
B0000AZ6DP|4|Nice product just be careful it lifts you really high
B0038YNA16|5|I haven't personally received mine yet but my friend has this  I've used it several times works great saves time and money.Seen some of the reviews talking about made in China what isn't anymore these days.
B000M5YYIW|4|Use a rubber band around your case. Mine just opened up one day and they all fell out. Plus side is I can now tell a pins size by feel after re sorting them all
B00CNI1SDA|5|Using this restored my husband's old leather coat to decent condition, which considering how bad it looked is saying something.  It just took a little bit of time and some elbow grease to make it look better.
B0000AY3SR|5|solid product
B0002SQU9K|5|No problems at all; works as advertised. Light and easy to use and no need to buy expensive heavy alternatives
B000J3GCUK|5|On time exactly as promised.  Works perfectly to cover up a damage hole in the back of my car.
B00LR0KZI4|3|Gets the job done, might be a little cheaply  made.
B00O1XQG2I|5|Perfect fit and runs like a top
B0006HNUFE|5|Nice shocks

B009YLO4ZS|5|Super easy to install and is exactly what I was looking for.
B000C1IJZK|5|Works great - solved my problem - can't beat it for they money - Will buy another when this one goes.
B00480BWA0|5|As listed.
B00OABYBJG|5|Work great
B002RMFJ7I|5|Good value and keeps flies away from my coop
B000RTYO9M|2|Put holes in my radiator. Helps with fan flow, but be very careful when installing or you'll be spending money to repair / replace your radiator...
B00D9C2CDO|5|This worked perfect! Decided 2 days before we were leaving for vacation to purchase this. Got on line, read the good reviews. Was so inexpensive we decided to try it. Got it next day (paid the little extra, well worth it!) It worked perfect. Drove 12-13 hours, at high rates of speed. I would definitely recommend this to someone who is needing the extra room. Also, we bought extra straps which we did not need. The straps that were with it is all you need. And, we met several cars on the way to and from the beach that had this same exact cargo bag on top of their car!
B00T8SWG8E|4|After reading on several post that tabs on these lights might have to be trimmed, I was leery of them fitting correctly.  I compared them to the OEM bulb and could find no differences.  Still had a hard time getting them to fit until I lubed the inside lower portion of the base and then they went right in.  2010 Dodge Dakota fog lamp.
B00W5119PC|1|Did the same as my old carburetor.
B00GWFPPU2|5|I bought this product for my Toyota Corolla Full 2014. they fit great in my car.
B000NCOKV0|5|Just what I was looking for
B00J0DV13I|4|Quality product, just as pictured
B001GKDFU0|5|Good quality.
B001UCEUC6|5|great
B001GJ3DZS|4|Works amazing, just make sure you're getting the right size. Cheaper alternatives elsewhere.
B00199BO4C|5|Made a huge difference in the tractor starting and running. I matched it with the electronic ignition.
B000J15THO|5|This is some good oil. My vehicle seemed to run smoother after using Royal Purple. No more shutter!
B0031HHA0C|5|I have Mercedes cars all, and the dealer is proud of their branded parts. This is the exact same unit the OEM supplier to Mercedes has, but at a fraction of the price.  Installed and came up automatically with no additional effort needed, all in the correct wheel positions, etc.
B0043AV4NK|5|Good and ir like
B008I1YO1E|5|it works very well and easy to install
B00T8HPEVG|5|So, I ordered these from my 2000 Mercedes E320.  At first when I went to put them in, I thought they were too big to fit, but it worked perfect.  The lights are great, and it made a huge improvement to the driving experience.  I ordered the bright white kit, which also comes with a couple of sleeves to change the color if you so desire.<br /><br />I live in the Bay Area, and shipping was same day!  Great job!
B00DNIUC4U|5|Amazing! Love these seat covers. Great deal for being so cheap. Although it said it would fit my car (2008 Saturn Aura) and the steering wheel didnt fit.
B00KVL4QOE|2|Small
B004JO3RO4|5|Same VW Rabbit Monster Mats as previously installed.  Very Good quality mats and they of course fit perfectly.
B00K5A1QGM|5|Looks great on the keychain and matches up great with my 2016 WRX interior trim!
B00U1Q9G2Q|5|The cargo net is great for keeping thing in place especially when opening the rear deck.  The product exceeded my expectations​!  The seller delivered quickly.
B00407V6YI|3|paint was a little flat
B00F23BNUG|4|No bulb warning light in my 1995 Lexus SC400 when used as reverse lights. I wish they were brighter; the window tint makes it hard to see when backing up at night.
B0099QQTWY|4|pricey but hope it works
B009KHGR1K|5|Great item!
B00A2G16UU|3|Pair Recaro Style JDM black racing seats (red stitching)<br /><br />Not too bad; black fake leather is good quality and suede insert fabric is a nice has touch and feel to it, however at the passenger side seat the fabric does not cover all the side panel thus exposing some of the foam, not so cool. The red stitching is not tied off at the end and thus can unravel unless you fix it. Slides can be mounted without extra hardware if you have a strong drill bit and room for a low mount seat, I had no need to purchase any additional hardware.Seat's are a bit narrow but foam expands easily during driving, remains to be seen how they hold up. Price wise they are a fair buy, saw similar ones at the auto swap meet for $50 less but maybe not as nice looking, the red stitching makes for a nice touch. Overall a good and fair product, could use a little bit of quality control before shipping this China made seat.
B00FLFX1QO|5|Nice quality.  Keeps the radiator where it belongs.
B001GC7TNW|5|For upgrading the intake on the 7.3l it worked out very nice and for the price I wouldn't bother wasting time to find the size around town. Very good quality and if you have a 7.3l just do this upgrade with the 6637 air filter and you won't regreat it. I switched over after 2yrs using a K&N and it was very noticeable.
B002R106I6|5|Excellent respond
B008Y5ADFA|4|My 3yr old loves it!  He's been wanting to ride forever.  The straps are a little short but still work for a bigger guy like my father-in-law.  This harness makes the kid sit pretty close but if it doesn't bother him, it's fine with me.  The wife was nervous as could be, as was the mother and mother-in-law but after the first couple rides with them following close behind, they were able to relax quite a bit.
B00HI2WZUQ|5|Works on a 2015 Forester.
B00823FSRC|1|I have a 15.6 canoe. This cart was absolutely useless. There was no way to get the canoe securely fastened to this thing without it collapsing. The best I could do was get it strapped down till the bottom of the canoe was against the wheels, again making it useless. I tried for a couple of hours using different straps and angles, all to no avail. Unless you have a light kayak, I would not recommend this thing.
B00FPTMLLM|5|Its the best I've  used in my car so far , I tried  everything on the market and this is by far the best, im not going to go on with a long long story how good it is but don't thing what you use on your cheap horrible leather couch is good enough for the car, it is NOT
B0013916XW|5|Great fit. Provides nice protection, and easy application.
B000CINVA6|5|Good for hard to reach places.  Sometimes you can't beat white lithium.
B00MVQPQ0U|4|Came packaged in opened box that had been placed inside a heavy plastic bag. Very bright. Easy installation.
B00KAN52ZU|5|Purchased this Guardian Bell for my Dad. He loved it. He makes me a little nervous when riding at the age of 70, so hopefully this bell will ward off gremlins from messing with his Honda Goldwing.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with the product. Apparently it only works if you gift the bell to another biker. You cannot purchase it for yourself!
B008EWPHZE|5|clear view, great buy!!
B000IZ3OH8|4|good filter.
B00FY1013G|1|Finally had time to install this bumper and find they sent me two of one side so I can not put it together. Need one of each side to make work.
B009B5ROYU|5|Worked awesome!
B002QLT4IK|3|OK for price but smaller than I thought they would be.  Wish they had another size bigger than this one but smaller than the next one.
B001DCN24U|5|This is definitely a strong arm. Factory arm failed on me so I purchased this one. It is easy to install and lifts the hood with ease.
B00Q88QCAA|1|My 2000 Road King has a very tight tolerance between the crankcase/sensor and filter even this wrench would not work,<br />I ended up with the old fashion screw driver.
B002Q1LIV6|5|Great item
B00XPAPEOE|5|I bought this from FullAutoParts as a replacement for a 2006 Scion tC. My horn randomly stopped working and I found this to be the issue. With OEM replacements from Toyota dealerships being $220 at best, and the only aftermarket option on RockAuto at $180, I was about to forget about it. I did some more searching and found off-brand replacements like this on ebay and Amazon. Since this is basically a special cable connector and almost a tenth the price, it was well worth the risk. It only took about half an hour to replace and my horn now works again. It's only been three days, so I can't speak to its durability yet.
B000GBGNQS|1|I'll keep this short.  I bought this for my 2000 Volvo S70 w/o trunk spoiler (as it was advertised to fit) and it couldn't hold the trunk open.  Infact, it felt like it wasn't even there.  Returned, bought Stabilus for a few more dollars and that worked perfectly.  You could also see this was thinner in comparison and the fit around the connecting rod wasn't right.  Don't buy this.
B002OAZZB8|5|Cool
B001AWLTX4|3|only reason im not a big fan of it cuz its a velcro back. i thought it was  a one peice to put over my head.. and it does its job.
B0050EEOK8|5|This is a rock solid item.  The stance is pretty wide, so this is more of a garage or industrial thing.  I definitely give this a seal of approval
B00250G1AQ|5|Exactly what I was needing.  Fast delivery.  Thank you very much.
B00450X9I6|2|BEWARE! Unfortunately these gloves ran small so I had to return the 2XL gloves for a 3XL. Unfortunately the 3XL gloves started ripping on our five day biking trip. I would not purchase these again...with all the returns and the expedited postage my $22.49 biking gloves have turned into a very expensive purchase!
B001O0BJUK|5|They are great! Would buy again.
B000C39C86|5|Great Price
B003POHULA|5|Had to trim the bumper to fit the original washer, but it was easily done, and seems to work fine on my '01 V70 2.4T.
B012QTJ92W|5|This keeps my white shoes white! A simple solution to black scuff marks on the toes of my shoes. Highly recommend!
B00681BDXI|3|Have to keep reprogramming every couple weeks. Easy to do but very annoying especially if it's raining out and you can't just click to get in.
B000C42QUG|5|On-time and perfect fit.
B00N2ZLOH8|5|Arrived quick, and perfect fit...
B00P6OTSHG|4|Great product
B004V5YR68|1|This product is cheap plastic,IT broke after 2 days use..Dont buy.
B00SLX3QMM|5|Worked great for lost ones. Took them to the dealership and the programmed both keys and fobs for $30.
B00QXQXIWW|2|Save your time and money! These lights are terrible. The old Halogen bulbs are 5 times as bright as these are! I put one of these in and immediately removed it after comparing brightness to old bulbs. 2 stars for fast shipping.
B00D2IK4FS|5|Customer service was very helpful in guiding me through the installation process.  These fit my car perfectly and were easy to install, after a couple of questions.
B008G2CB88|2|It's OK for the price . Mirror glass is blue . qualities is not there. If you're driving on a bumpy road the glass in the mirror will  vibrate.
B00HO9MLGQ|5|Fit great.. the one corner of the passenger side one won't stay down - but that's probably my own fault somehow. Ha!
B00HY06FPI|5|Very bright and easy to install!
B00F84INSO|5|like it
B00V2XHMBY|5|Very great and also very bright love the led bar easy to install
B004A9EW24|2|Glass came out of goggles but I guess you get what you pay for.
B00WID0OEE|5|Best squeegee I have ever used. One swipe and my shower glass is spot free. The included replacement blades make this product far exceed anything else available.
B00N0PYBIO|4|I bought this pod filter for my go kart that has a 2.5&#34; inlet which this said it would fit and it did but it wasn't the most snug fit. Otherwise though the filter has done great. I really don't have any complaints. The anodized Finnish looks good and the blue also gives it some flash.
B00CA69ADK|1|poor instructions and paint brush fell apart
B0015D19SS|4|Great price for lightweight/light duty roof rack!!!
B00JXYKJ5A|2|Bulbs only lasted a couple of months before one burned out. These are too expensive to replace every couple of months! Looked great on my 2013 Camaro SS/RS while they lasted.
B008P1C0WM|5|Yay bright lights down the road
B00GZLMEPM|5|restored the headlight on my wife's car in just 15 min, made the look like new and the lights are as bright as they were when new
B00265FXFY|1|The link says that this bulb fits a 2006 Mazda3 but this is not true. The mounts on the Mazda3 bulbs are completely different from this D2S bulb. I have no idea why the fitting tool would say this fits a 2006 Mazda3. IT DOES NOT!
B00E9HWS9G|5|Fit our 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk perfectly with just a bit of trimming needed.
B00KL3ALGO|4|I have installed the shades, and I'm very satisfied with this product. They seem very well-attached (I don't worry that they will slide or fall off), and they do cover most of the window area. I have also adjusted each one a few times, and there is no problem with it sticking a second or third time, so I am confident that I can readjust them as needed; however, I have just noticed recently that when I removed one of them to adjust it, the plastic tore from the outer edge on one end. The piece still clings and hasn't lost its shape, but now I'm a little skeptical about it lasting as long as I'd hoped. Overall, though, it's a very good product!
B000VKN4R0|5|Installed on an '07 Tahoe LTZ.  Fit perfectly.
B00D6J8ENM|5|They fit perfectly on my car and they look great also
B00KJAEQFG|2|The bolts that came with this are SOFT.  I broke one.  I got it out and was able to use the oem bolts, instead.  Throw away the bolts that come with this.
B00QU10IH8|4|so for so good
B000BZL08U|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B00J6990A2|1|The lights are very bright. I don't know why there are cooling fins on the top since LED's don't generate heat.   The screw securing the mounting bracket to the body is stripped and contacted the seller and no response from them about obviously defective product. don't waste your time and money.  If the issue is resolved, I will update the review.
B006GJPEAK|1|The description for this item is incorrect. The description said that they are 9&#34; long but they are only 71/2&#34; long.
B00GYDBPL0|4|Need to order the bling out screws as well
B000PL07B6|5|This is a great primer. It works like its own guide coat, goes on thick and sands nicey.  Two small issues were  1. because its so thick you run out of can a lot quicker than you think. Buy an extra can or two. I did an engine bay with 2 cans and i barely had enough to give a few spots a light second coat.  2. the spray nozzle is kind of s***ty. I have used other SEM products with better nozzles, i wonder why these have a traditional nozzle.
B00EDFM6R8|5|Works great
B00FA8XRIO|5|These all-weather floormats are an OEM product, so the fit is perfect and the quality is excellent.
B000E3020G|5|Good price. Just what I needed
B00852QTIC|5|Love it!
B0012Q86A2|5|Excellent product. as good as the original and for a good price
B00FKZ2YWC|5|Good s***
B00ZM9LANA|5|10/10 I recently went on a road trip and this backseat organizer came in very handy! Very strong and durable for anyone. The Auto trash bag was very helpful and convenient, it was not any cheap material, very please with this product and this company. Glad I bought their product!
B0031I204W|3|OK for a smaller moped/scooter, or bicycle.  It would have to be a rather small motorcycle.  Too small for a regular/full size moped/scooter.
B00KTIXICK|4|Got these to replace the cases on fully functional '00 Ford Expedition remotes. One the buttons had worn completely down and the other was in a house fire and the ring melted through the loop. Swapping was as easy as pop out the board and battery, and insert into the new ones. The fit and finish is very nice; with the battery being a little loose (no effect once closed up). I docked a star as there are no product ID or FCC numbers on the back. I understand that it's for a broad range of vehicles/IDs but it would be nice so as in the future there is a reference. I kept the old cases for my reference, and will pass them along when I sell the vehicle. Overall very satisfied.
B00NO5OMQG|5|Worked very well in my 1978 Honda CX500. I was glad to be able to get them.
B00OK1243Q|5|Quick delivery and looks great.  Definitely a good buy
B000OQITW6|1|I was expecting a thicker product - more like a cloth.  This is just a piece of paper.  I thought I could substitute this product for face cloths while vacationing in Europe where washcloths are often not supplied in hotels.  I was unable to use this product for that purpose.
B002ZBWKDC|5|love it!
B004JBI5HG|5|Awesome filter
B00AZS8Y82|1|The item was built strong but with the design of my rv basement I would of lost 1/2 to 2/3 of the storage area so I returned it.
B00KGIE0F2|5|this product came the day that I was told and was the right fit for my outboard motor
B00GI2CBIS|2|The print was exactly what I was hoping for however the sunshade itself seemed incomplete. It isn't very thorough on how to use the suction cups that come with it. Also the material is quite thin and flimsy and already seems to be fraying at the seams after only being used the first week.
B006Q7C7L6|2|This did not keep my battery charge full as I hoped. Didn't seem to work at all.
B004RCW1XG|5|Got this for my RV and it is perfect.  Nice space saving and light weight way to store knives so the blades don't knock together. The slots are graduated in size so I can only fit two of my chef's knives in there but otherwise perfect.
B000BYB8HE|5|I love these spark plugs. I'm getting great power and improved fuel economy. Nothing but positives!
B00GGXBYS2|5|Fast shipping and good rates!
B00LEBLI82|5|All my lights worked, they do give off a blueish hue but it's for my motorhome which I don't spend that much time in, it's actually kind of a cool look.
B008FLSUFI|2|These air vents did not work for me.  They were plastic, difficult to install and I decided to send them back.
B000C9MIKE|5|Allowed me to make an adjustable drag link.  Nice product.
B000C7QGMC|5|Good Quality radiator, perfect fit to my Z28 1997. Recomended
B00P2D3VZG|5|Solid LED bulb<br /><br />I bought these for my 2015 Honda Odyssey and they look great. I wasn't looking for a BRIGHT LED bulb. I prefer a more soft and clean look. These bulb did the trick!<br /><br />A solid build and backed with a 12 years lifespan? Why not...Philips is know for a high quality build for these kind of stuff. The price was reasonable compared to other Philips LED/HID bulb.<br /><br />I would recommend buying these if you're looking for a soft and not to bright LED light.
B00EPDLQV0|4|I love the quality of the emblem, but the sticky stuff doesn't last. Mine fell off of my car and I had to buy a whole new one because it was about the same price as any adhesive that wouldn't hurt my car.
B00EFDW43O|5|Easy to install (thanks to very clear video and written instructions). Work as they should, for 1/6 the cost of Toyota parts...
B00CI94YBC|5|Like Firefly class ships? Want you car to look shiny?<br />Then Shiong mao niao, This is bout the coolest Goram decal in the 'verse. And in a 2 pack to boot! right smart!!<br />Made my car feel just ruttin' good, and my laptop looks something powerful.<br />Follow the instructions so's you don't sully your car. A mite of rubbin' alcohol will prep it.<br />Results look so Jian de gui, mighty shiny. A bang-up sticker.
B001QT9KO6|5|I put it I. In and installed Avery and leak in my Bavados cooling system almost immediately it worked.  I have not had to add any coolant since.  I am very pleased with the product.  thank you
B0073HCTFW|5|My vehicle is fixed at a great price.
B0000AY65X|5|great product to use
B002RYE3PK|5|I love it
B00Y17GQ7Y|1|Very poor product.  For some reason it has very poor suction for its size.  I have a small 3hp shop vac that has more suction.  It is worthless to me.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  I would get it 0 stars if I could.
B003Z55XKO|5|perfect for my detailing
B004PKSUGC|3|Slightly damaged during shipping and pulley was off center but was fairly easy to repair, still works fine.
B00BUS3AKS|5|Seen them in many cars.  They conceal your property in the back.
B000VUR6CE|4|Nice add-on
B00BITQPSI|5|Good 4 the price great buy
B00269504E|5|Right on the money, great fit and easy to install
B0006VORDY|4|We love the stove.  if it had a quick connect fitting rather than a threaded flare requiring a tool to attach or remove it would be more convenient.
B000C9LOHW|5|This worked in my 2003 GMC Sierra with 4L60e transmission.
B00B9FEHCW|5|As advertised. Fast shipping. Very pleased.
B001G6LTTS|1|Was too big for my 96 Honda Accord transmission drain plug.
B003YJ8TVQ|1|it is not good and it start and off by it self
B000M8SY0I|5|A friend had a flat on his rear motorcycle tire. He had the CO2 catridges with his flat repair kit.  They were just enough to get him down the road to a gas station to fill up the tire.  If we were in a worse location it might have been difficlut.  This portable tire pump will make sure I can fill the tire if I get a flat and make a repair on the road.  I replace the slime liquid with a standard tire repair kit.
B00495UQUG|5|good buy, no problems
B005DSNRYU|5|High Quality and fit nicely !
B007J7E47C|5|great mat.  Just as described!
B0053O9FQS|4|Always great stuff form Red Line.  I've used their oils and greases for 20+ years.  This one went into some trailer hubs that I don't expect to have to re-lube for a loooong time.
B001DGEY1Q|5|I wish the auto parts stores still carried just the blade refills. These are great!
B0006IX87S|5|love it
B001U8KNQM|3|Did the job. I wish a tighter fit. It has straps hard to get for the back seat.
B00RPVIQC6|5|This product is simple and functional.  It arrived on time and works as advertised.  Price was right.
B001H8VLFC|2|Works ok. Not excellent, just ok.
B00029KCVG|4|I used Thermo Tec sleeve to protect a silicon hose on a cooling system that passed next to the exhaust pipe and it does an excellent job of reflecting radiant heat.
B006B289RC|5|Installed these on my 06' Yamaha 1700. Great stoping power, made a huge improvement
B003CIVAH4|5|Was a gift and well received.
B00REJX5BQ|5|Perfect .
B00JMLFPJY|5|Works as it should
B00RUE0ULI|5|Ordered on a Friday morning, received it Monday.  Product is exactly what I was looking for.
B003KKJ7PG|1|Vibrates but does not make a noise
B00B210TL6|5|these bulbs arrived fast. they fit perfectly and work great. I recommend to all. very bright... exaclty what i wanted
B000C7YQ2Y|5|Had a concern with storing my Motor home at a storage facility. Didn't want to take a chance of someone pouring dirt/Salt/Suger in tank. Great deal for the price.
B00N8NBJPG|5|Good quality better price!!!
B00ORO4PVU|3|Thought it came with the special wrench as pictured, guess not.
B000C9QVD4|5|truck runs great !
B00TQ07IOQ|5|Idk what everyone else is complaining about , but i think they are nice and heavy duty enough 😏 it's not like they're made for a diseal truck or something . Very fast shipping , i got three days later after purchasing & they came in good packaging . VERY SATISFIED ☺
B000FQ9956|4|It had one bad scratch in it otherwise it was excellent I don't know what the fit is like yet I haven't installed it on the jeep yet.
B007Y85XMG|5|I put this starter on a Saturn sl2 and it fit perfectly. It has been going strong for four months now. Auto Zone wanted 175 bucks for one  so this was a great deal.  If the starter doesn't shut off move the square connector straight up.
B00FP0G5EK|5|Everything works great for the last couple of weeks. No issues
B0024NSSIM|5|As stated
B000HDIOX0|5|worked great. plugs were pre-gapped to correct specs. don't expect a noticeable performance increase just a longer life spark plug. It will only give you performance if you are at redline and only 2% at that time. For daily driving it just gives you piece of mind that the spark plug will last 3x longer. Be sure to use anti-seize on the threads because next time you want to replace spark plugs you may have to pay a mechanic to remove the head to replace spark plug... ouch$$$,<br />a cheap mechanic may charge you $500 because parts are $360 for a head seal kit on a 4 cylinder 99 integra.
B001KRIUH2|5|Great Radiator and it is very well made. Easy to install as well.
B00HAWLFA0|5|Came on time looks just like the old one.
B006RYVULG|5|great item to buy with great shipping.
B003O0Y9ZA|5|Easy installation.  New struts were on in 15 min with a flathead screwdriver, pliers and a kid to hold the tailgate up.
B004INIUQ6|5|Exactly what we wanted! Came even sooner then we were scheduled for.
B00JSJMUBQ|1|One star because sizing is off.  I have a 13&#34; steering wheel.  Got the small which says 12.5' - 13.5&#34;  and it was too big.
B00E0FRXQ0|5|Very nice Jacket, fits perfectly. I ordered one size larger than I normally would based on previous reviews. I am 185 6' and got the XL. Not 100% waterproof though but pretty good.
B00GHHU78A|5|Better than original!
B00766JBEC|1|The letter came apart as soon as I tried to peal the cover off to put on my car. Grrr.
B004B61B34|5|Towed a 1500lb trailer across the great state of Tennessee with a 2014 JKU and zero issues.  Great design and execution.
B00VGG2316|5|i love it
B000JFHNEC|5|Accurate Description, Well Packed, FAST Delivery & Great Price
B006CRT72W|4|Had only a few instances where the remote did not work at all. But for the most part, it works fantastic. Even with an occasional minor issue, I would still buy this again.
B0018E6T9I|5|My husband  thought these were for him. Sadly mistaken their mines.
B00KRQFA02|5|Arrived on time and looks great.
B005PYHYK0|5|Very happy
B004MUI7OA|5|Great quality at an excellent price!!!
B00HSTX274|5|I really love it
B0074GUBJ8|5|These mirrors fit the bill if you're looking for a clean no flames or teardrop look. They're just the right size to make them functional yet look slick on your bike. Chrome is very high quality with all the hardware you'll need to mount them. Can't beat the price for a pair of mirrors.
B0030MEJFC|4|I like the different spray modes, but not as much as the hold.  Worked great to glue down my carpet in my VW.
B00EL37R8U|5|I'm very pleased with the lights, I had a little bit of trouble installing some of them but after I  Adjusted the wire contact on the bottom of the bulb, they lit right up.they are very bright and really aluminate the inside of my camper I like the color of the lights, the day light white is very bright and pleasant to the eye. I could use a couple more so I'll be planning on buying some more soon
B004GCDU0A|4|Purchased this replacement part after seeing the dealership prices ($150+). I am satisfied with it; however, it isn't exactly perfect. On one side it is a bit low with the bumper filler, although it is difficult to see it. Worked great on my 2001 Chevy 2500HD.
B00T9LR5X6|5|Love this deal.  Been a Rain-X user for years and find these individual towelettes ideal for easy application.  With this large selection, I will be giving out a few for gifts to friends and relatives for them to use and enjoy.
B001FAI8GM|5|Fits great, even has padding to protect your paint.
B00EDWF1BE|5|These latches are excellent! I didn't like the way the hood would vibrate while driving down the highway with the old rubber latches. These hold the hood down with no vibrations from the wind. The install of them took about 30 minutes with two people.
