0446547646|5.0|I fell in love with this book. At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like it as much as Safe Haven, but it's easily my favorite Nicholas Sparks book now. It was suspenseful, thrilling.. not as action-packed as Safe Haven, but comes pretty close. I fell in love with Dawson's character within the first couple of chapters. I know I'm kind of jumping around with my review, but it's kind of hard not to spoil the plot. Needless to say, the book is very relatable and not too far-fetched. And per usual, the ending is a tearjerker. I totally recommend this book to anyone who needs a good read/cry.
B001AXNH92|5.0|This band is phenomenal, and this is a great live recording. Love it. If you are not already a fan, it's a great Dream Theater CD to cut your teeth on.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Very interesting characters, unexpected twists----makes one wonder if it is at all autobiographical.  As always a<br />Wonderful storyteller. I heartily recommend it.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Love Natalie in everything she does.  Very good modern rep of Norse Mythology.  Didn't know Asgard was Atlantis of the North.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Just what I was looking for in a puzzle game. I had worried the would be very few free puzzles to pick from,but there was a good selection.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Best book out of the series so far! I have never once read a book so interesting. I'm glad I chose to take my friends advice and read the books
B007HC3LHS|5.0|What a page turner!  Wonderfully written, albeit stomach-turningly violent at times.  A couple of surprising twists and turns, this book keeps you guessing. Adding Elizabeth Haynes' works to my MUST READ list.
0062014536|3.0|I have been waiting impatiently for this book to come out since I finished Pandemonium.  This series has been one of my favorites, but I feel like this concluding book falls short of the previous two.  In the first two books the world felt so much richer and the characters more real.  In Requiem I felt like the characters lost a lot of their appeal.  I couldn't remember why I loved Alex in Delirium or why I loved Julian in Pandemonium.  They were so boring.  Both of the boys took a back seat to all of this revolution business which was not even tied off nicely in the end.  Lena also didn't seem to have the depth she had in the previous books.  I felt like she didn't really feel anything.  She seemed indifferent towards both Julian and Alex for the most part, when previously she felt so many emotions towards them.  There was none of the romance that makes your heart flutter like there was in the first two books.  In a world where you are fighting for the right to love, I expected a lot more focus on the love triangle than the revolution (which I would have been happy had it not been so heavily focused on).  I didn't really feel like Lena was fighting to love either Julian or Alex.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW HERE<br /><br />I felt like the ending was abrupt and messy.  Raven was killed off in such an uneventful way that you really don't notice or care that she is gone (she's not really a big character anymore) and you don't find out what happens to Tack.  In the end Lena chooses Alex.  You get some reasons for this, but its obvious that she still has feelings for Julian.  Also, you don't get to find out how Lena's choice affects Julian and if he ends up happy or not.<br /><br />Half of the book was about Hana and the ending to her story was very bland.  She's wandering about and is like \\"Oh, everything will okay!\\"  I was expecting her to join the Resistance as the Cure didn't seem to work completely on her.  I felt like the old Hana was in there and thought she was going to come out, but she never did.  It seemed like the author couldn't decide whether she wanted Hana to be completely cured or if she wanted the cure to not have worked on her.  Hana did a lot of things that it doesn't seem like a cured person would do - bringing Grace food, lying, sneaking into the Crypts to see Cassie, etc.  She seemed like old Hana most of the time, but then the author would suddenly remember \\"Oh right, she's Cured\\" and she'd have some moments where she acted the way you'd expect a cured person to.  Her character was very inconsistent - at times vibrant and rebellious other times bland.<br /><br />The outcome of the Resistance as a whole was poorly resolved.  So, Portland is freed, but what about the rest of the country?  What's to stop the government from sending troops to take the city back?  The Invalids have not won at the end of this book.  Portland isn't even terribly important to many of the members of the Resistance.  It's not really a major city and only Lena, Alex, and Anabel came from there.<br /><br />There were a lot of things that took up a lot of pages and didn't seem too important.  The whole part with breaking the dam just seemed like a long drawn out way to expose Lu as a traitor and for our Invalids to find out about the troops who were coming.  It really didn't add much to the story or make a big impact on the Resistance (they failed in the end!).  There was also a lot of random conversations between Lena and her mom that didn't really add a whole lot to the story either.  The first half there was a lot of moving about with very little action and then very little moving and suddenly an attack on Portland.<br /><br />Lena spends a lot of time sleeping or by herself and not really interacting with anyone.  She starts to share Julian's tent, but then acts like she doesn't care about him.  She pines for Alex, but not in a way that you really feel her pain.  It is just kind of in a passing way.  She seems to have lost all of the passion she had in the previous books.  During the attack on Portland she doesn't even participate.  She only goes to find Grace.<br /><br />As I got closer to the ending I was starting to think the author would need another book to tie off all these loose ends and give the series the ending it deserved.  This one just doesn't stack up against the first two.  Something about it makes it hard to love these characters anymore.  I guess I just don't understand the point of writing a story as a trilogy if you are going to gloss over so much and not tie everything up at the end.  The whole point is having enough pages to tell the WHOLE story.  I am sad that this book was not all it could have been.assion she had in the previous books.  During the attack on Portland she doesn't even participate.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great story and a truly funny and charismatic protagonist. I enjoyed every minute of this book.  I'm not a scientist, but the science fiction seemed based in our known world of physics.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I loved this movie, seen it for the first time right before the Oscars....It had me sitting on the edge of my seat at one point.  if you like suspense, want a movie that will make you hold your breath in a few places...Argo is it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|You can find a better story teller than Vice Flynn.  This novel is another fast-paced Mitch Rapp thriller that keeps you on edge from beginning to end.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, and I have recently seen the movie. It varied a little i.e that is the movie to the book, but on the whole stayed on the plot pretty well.<br />Typical Nicholas Sparks.... but still up there in his usual style.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so fun. One of friends a week ago were 100 meters away from 10 million meters. That is the longest I have ever seen anyone go before. Hopefully they make a Temple Run 3. That would be awesome! Temple Run is so fun!
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie liked the way they incorporated a lot of video games in it.  I didn't really know what all the video games were cause they were before my time but still a really fun movie.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Had looked for this everywhere! Product came exactly as described and shipped very fast. My daughter loves it! Very happy with my purchase!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a great child book. It provides some humor for middle age children great for 3rd 4th and 5th graders.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I Love this story. It's heartfelt and makes me happy. Overall good book even if you don't like Justin. Perfect .
B00942X8PY|4.0|I only give it 4 stars because it has no tutorial, so I suggest you look through the reviews where other people tell you how to play.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's simple to pick up (once you know the rules), easy to play, and gets challenging as you progress.
B006BXTOFC|5.0|AWESOME WORK, AWESOME PRICE, VERY IMPRESSIVE ALL THE WAY AROUND. DON'T KNOW WHY I WAITED SO LONG. GREAT WORK GUYS
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I'm an advance Sudoku player and I love this app. It has different ways for you to play, and has [as stated] more than 10,000 puzzles for you to play! I am constantly on public transportation, including underground where I get no reception, so this game is great! It even has a error-checker, in which I used for my hubby who just started playing this game solely bc of this app. It has everything I would want from a digital sudoku game.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|After nearly a decade of service, my MDR-700s broke apart. I was going to buy another set but after a bit more research I found these. I'm glad I did. These are lightweight, fit over my ears perfectly and deliver excellent sound. They're great at canceling out noise and I look forward to using them for my upcoming plane trip. Really happy with these cans.
B00BCOQSSQ|3.0|The book was a decent read. More of a adventure with a lot in common with Merlin type adventures. O.k.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|Great book- I felt really involved in the story and could really experience the turmoil he felt at times. I have some personal attachment to this subject and usually find the portrayal of bipolar disorder as Hollywood-esque. This was not the case with this book- it was raw and unapologetic without being distressing for the reader. It made things very matter-of-fact and exposed the human side and the effects you could infer it was having on his family and relationships. I really enjoyed it and also despaired for him but could not put it down! Will definitely read again...soon!<br /><br />On a side note- I saw the film which in its own right was very good- but wasn't a patch on the book. The main disappointment I felt was that they revealed the reason behind some of his major outbreaks at the very start of the film- the slow and delayed revelation of this in the book was my favourite part- it had a build up and had you guessing and made you feel very invovled. But it is worth a watch...perhaps after you've read this wonderful book.
B00BNWWUDY|4.0|Side Effects is a film you can't really describe without giving anything away. Avoid the trailers if possible, make it through the slow build up and you will get quite a few surprises in the second half. Easily one of the best thrillers I have seen in a long time. Jude Law in his best performance in years as a psychiatrist and Rooney Mara, fresh off of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, knocks it out of the park again as his depressed patient. She has become one of my favorite actresses. Catherine Zeta-Jones is effective and Channing Tatum has little to do, but is adequate enough. Never boring and often surprising, if this is Steven Soderbergh's last movie, he went out at the top of his game.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan for a long time and they never disappoint.  Another classic! Can't wait to see them live.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My hubby sold our horses because they were getting too expensive to maintain properly, now this game covers my need to tend and care for horses without getting sweaty, stinky, and spending any real money. This is fun! 8-)
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|Works great in all respects on Kindle Fire HD. It can play rmvb files perfectly, which I had not previously been able to find a good player for.
B0074D3CAQ|2.0|I am surprised that this book as such great reviews. I found it boring. It was good for the first half, and then he continued to walk and walk and nothing interesting happened. The book was a big disappointment - I expected something much better based on the great reviews.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I gave the five star rating because it was free for Kindle users and and didn't know there was a calculator for the Kindle.  Works great!! :)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Each and every one of these books is amazing and special in its own way. True they aren't for everyone... but if you do read these books you won't ever regret it!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My kids love the Dr Panda games and this new game doesn't disappoint at all. My kids love the mini games they are also learning as they are playing all the Dr Panda games are well worth the price. Dr Panda is the best.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had read this book several times before buying this, and it is great as ever. Orson Scott Card`s masterpiece and beginning of the Ender Quintet, it tells the story of Ender Wiggins, a brilliant boy who lives in a future when humans have been attacked by the Buggers, an alien race. Ender is recruited by Colonel Graff at the age of six and taken to Battle School, a place where boys are trained to be soldiers and commanders of the fleet. But I've given away too much. Read this book and be carried away by Orson Scott Card`s storytelling genius!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|love it. want to play more. only problem is with my kindle it seems I have to press on things numerous times. over all great game.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|first saw the televised show in January and after one session became hooked.  I saw on Facebook the seasons were available, and as usual - went to Amazon
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I liked this book and I'd recommend it to both fantasy fans and people who like short books. Personally I found it to \\"skim\\" over most story elements, but it is a refreshing contrast to the sludge that A Song of Ice and Fire becomes in the last books.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Really like playing this game and I think you will also.  I recommend.  An excellent game to keep you busy.
1439148813|5.0|Great book on our space program! I highly recommend this fast paced very honest look at where we've been. Get it for your library. Gene Kranz is a terrific author!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|It was good, but the ending wasn't that great. I was hoping it had a better plot as well, but overall movie 4/5.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The short version: Great sound quality, easy to use, decent range, ok battery life, mic works well enough, acceptably durable.<br />------------------------<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sound quality- I am picky when it comes to headphones. I often buy $100+ headphones and these didn't dissapoint. Great for gaming or watching movies with surround sound, almost as good for music (I listen to everything from classical to classic rock to hip-hop). Very good bass, solid mids and clear highs.<br />Value- The wired headphone aspect of these is enough to justify the price, the wireless feature and the mic make it a good buy<br />Comfortable- I have worn these for hours at a time with no problem. Good weight, stay on well enough (starting to slide when I tilt my head but they have been heavily used for about a year)<br />Customizable- there are volume controls and a mic mute button plus 3 customizable buttons (get some free logitech software to make customization easy)<br />Durable- These things have taken a beating, with 30+ hours of use every week these things are holding up impressively well. They are finally starting to slip a little after about a year of use, but still function as well as ever.<br />Volume- not the loudest headphones ever, but they do a good job of keeping external sound out (note: these are not &#34;noise cancelling&#34; headphones)<br /><br />Cons- battery life could be better. I typically get about 4-6 hours of use per charge. At least the charging cable is long enough to allow use as regular headphones/headset<br />Mic sensitivity- pics up every noise. If I'm on skype I have to have my sound through the headphones and not my speakers. If I use this headset in the same room as my roommate everyone can hear him twice as if he were wearing both his headset and mine.<br />Long range connectivity- the range is not as far as I would have liked, if you go farther than 15ft the sound begins to cut out and the headset will restart itself (unmuting itself in the process) and playing the mute/unmute notification noise over skype/ventrilo each time.<br /><br />Overall worth the money and a great headset.
B008NAFU9A|5.0|A great short romance read if you like short stories and novellas, I read this one in just a few hours. The romance is secondary to the story but the ending part of the romance is intense. I loved these Ethan and Ophelia and could have read more about them. This book is part of the Forever Girl series and I think you could read this book or The Forever Girl in any order, they both stand alone, they complement each other. If you wanted to learn more about the world building and character in The Forever Girl you can find that in this book or if you want to get a feel for the premise of the series before buying the first book in the series you can read this little prequel first.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Once you read one of this author's book, you become addicted.  Once I start reading his book, I can not put it down until I finish it.  Love this writer.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I read the Part One free sample from another site and then got the full edition in print. I loved being able to read so much before deciding to buy, but I think the second part of the book is even better than the first part! Sophia is a strong but flawed character and the world building was really interesting. The plot kept me up late at night reading wondering what would happen next. Hope there will be more in this series soon.
0312330537|3.0|He was given to too much details and therefore too lengthy for my taste. He could have used half the number of pages to have to tell his story and with better results as far as I am concerned'
0736092269|5.0|It gives you very detailed information of which exercise that might cause serious injury if not done properly (too late for me lol :/ ) It also gives detailed information on which muscle that specific exercise you're looking for will work or incorporate into your workout. Will order the 4th edition if one ever comes out.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is by far, the best series I have ever watched.  I have watched it three times now, and will do so again.  Can't wait for season 4.
1451696205|5.0|I chose to read this book because I wanted to see the movie and I usually try to read the books before I see a film based on the book. It took me a little while to get into the book but in the end I loved it. It has since been placed on my short list of favorite books. Excellent and quick read for almost anybody.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the game was great, I really loved it. if you are wondering whether to get this game or not, GET IT! the only reccomendation I would make to the developers is to make the player able to jump off of the zipline at any point during the slide down.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Riveting adventure that has everything you could want. The characters are interesting, the action is non-stop, and it is totally unpredictable. Really enjoyed it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It was a good book. It could've had a better ending, but overall the plot was really good. The characters made this book very interesting. As I got to the end I couldn't stop reading. This truly is a good book especially for teens.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Luv it;it is the best my nefu likes it the characters are amazing lol. Also keep up on the updates because their amazing.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Great story when I read it at 15, just as captivating at 28. Such a simple premise, just don't stop walking. Ever.
B0055S348W|5.0|This is an easy and effective wireless print app.  Setting up my. printer was a bit confusing at first... but not a game changer.  I have had no print issues with this app. The only problem I found was with printing coupons.. still have to print those through email docs.  It would be good if these apps would coordinate with the makers of Print Share Mobile.  GREAA&Agrave;AAAT App
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|beach buggy blitz is an awesome racing app. u crash.  u  drive.l  love it sooooooooooooooooooooooo sooooo soooooo ssoooooooo much. love it.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I was hooked after 3 pages and it did not disappoint to the very end. Every time I thought I knew which direction it was going, I was pleasantly surprised. I am hoping for a sequel that might unite Luvinia and Will. Just a hope :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it actually makes me feel like am a kid again... the colors crate a fun environment.. i love the fact that its 3D too, its my new fav game.......did i mention the accuracy OMG! its just........ WOW!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Although this was not one of his better books I love his work and enjoyed the book.Would recommend easily.Miss a little of the old Grisham spark.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I feel as if I might have been a Dor in a former life.<br />Constantly counting constantly wasting the moment!
B005974CNA|5.0|Awesome CD<br /><br />word requirements demand that i share a haiku:<br /><br />haikus are easy,<br />but sometimes they don't make sense.<br />refrigerator.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|Some sad parts but some very funny too. I really liked it. Good writing and good acting made it a great movie.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is wonderfully written by a true American hero.  I laughed and cried along with Chris as he told of the trials and tribulations of war for all soldiers. It definitely gave a perspective that not many know, (especially civilians). I recommend this book to anyone.  I admit the first reason that I purchased this book is that Chris is from the town that I live in.  I am extremely glad that I did.  Once started, I was hard pressed to put it down, (even to go to bed).
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I loved this movie, the very first time that I saw it, when I was still a child and watching it again, helps relive those precious moments.<br /><br />Would greatly recommend to everyone, one of the best made movies of the era, together with Ben-Hur, Robe, etc.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun to play always new things to do and never boring lots of goals to complete and easy to play
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Much to my surprise and delight ... the flat characture of Christian from the first volume of the trilogy ... takes on depth ... dimension ... and yes ... even a sympathetic understanding - no mean accomplishment. And in the end ... love conquers all ... perhaps a hokey concept to contemporary readers ... but a theme with proven ability to withstand the test of time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a action packed game full of adventure,fun,and pure awesomeness.Anyone who gets this app will be truly satisfied. And please don't listen to anyone who says it's bad. REALLY!!!
B000068C3U|5.0|Cabaret  Liza Minnelli<br />I first saw this as a child in the early 70s liked it then and now, hard to find but worth it.  price was good shipping was fast
B000000OMP|5.0|Well- cant even count how many times played this &#34;cassette&#34; in the 80's and heard it at parties. Glad it is on CD now- had to have it.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|Thrown together just to get a movie out there.  They could have done so much more with the same characters, action and just a better script.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This is one of the best movies EVER. I even have the same steer weathervane on my barn that he throws his cowboy hat up on in the movie. I wont let my hubby do that as is too high to have to try and get it back down. Wish this would come out on blu-ray!
B00AYB1RGG|1.0|Waste of time and money.  Wow, I missed Stallone's Dredd in the first 10 mins.  This shouldn't have made any money.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Really loved the humour. Marian Keyes never disappoints. Would recommenced this one to friends in a heartbeat. I really enjoyed it.
B00A0SJWQU|1.0|Total wast of time.  I can't believe that we paid for this.  They should pay us.  What a toally horrible attempt to throw a star out there and make some money.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Great game for travel and hospital stays wherever there is a waiting time -- great for eye and hand coordination
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We had a blast watching this with our grand daughter!  Going in our dvd collection for sure.<br />I recommend this movie for any age group
B009MCRHH6|3.0|This game is super cool and fun the first hour or two you play it but the dev did not do a good job of progressing from easy to hard and out of nowhere it becomes really difficult and the fun stops as fast as hitting a brick wall. I went from addicted to delete in a few days. Glad I got it free as app of the day :)
B00AFEY354|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen this year. Emma Watson is incredible, as usual. This movie is a must see.
B009NCM248|5.0|Good tunes throughout this album. Keeping it strong and loud. Good deal of the day for metal march madness month.
B00AEBB8NI|5.0|Highly recommend reading the book first.  This is one of few movies made that actually follows the script of the book, awesome story and even better movie!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love it. I think it's a lot of fun. I like that even when you are not playing you are making money
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've played it for years on the computer...so I was  glad to see it available on Kindle!!  I'm addicted to it!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|Was pleasantly surprised by the series of books. Wished there was more books in the series as i hate to say goodbye to the characters
0439023491|5.0|Catching fire is the sequel to The Hunger Games. This book has many twists and turns as the first one. It kept you on edge and adds some spice to the story line. The love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale is back and juicier than ever. It has some surprises in the relationships and shows the hardship they have to go through. It also has the action and suspense it provided in the first book, the Games are back and better than ever. It keeps you on your toes and you never want to put the book down. Great detail and you really feel like you are n the book. It is very well written and it has everything you would want it in book. I would recommened this book to anyone who wants a good, fun, and interesting read. I was very pleased.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Two hours of action packed classic Bond - this movie is a keeper. Best Bond film since the Roger Moore days.
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all times it is so excited you always want to know what's going to happen next
0385344228|3.0|This book was going okay and I was kind of enjoying it but then I lost the book so I don't know how it ends.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This book is going to be ranked right up among my favorites.  I love learning about dogs, search and rescue, and training. You get hooked early and can't stop reading until it's finished!
030758836X|5.0|Couldn't put this book down!  It definitely lived up to all the hype and talk it got.  I would like to read her new book.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|This is unmistakeable Bon Jovi from begining to end.  All the negative reviews are (in my opinion) way off.  I have always been a Bon Jovi fan and I think this album is the perfect addition to my collection.  I would recommend this to any fan, I will be lisening to it over and over.
0316098337|3.0|A friend recommended this to me and said it was fantastic.  She failed to mention it is written from an uneducated child's perspective which was really hard to get into at first.  It took me a while to finish this because I just didn't want to pick it up to continue reading.
B00BHMF578|2.0|After this movie got nominated for some big awards, I was sorry to have missed this when it was playing at our local theater.  It had not stayed very long.  Well we were excited to watch it at home but glad to only pay the rental rather than waste the price of tickets.  The acting was pathetic and the story line predictable.  It was not worthy of an academy award.  Both Lincoln and Silver Linings Playbook were much better movies.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I don't get a lot of these reviews.  How can you expect a band who has been in existence for 30 years to be the exactly the SAME after 3 decades?  What lunacy is it to expect that these grown men play exactly the same music now?  People grow up, it's called maturing.  And they change.  Has it ever occurred to some reviewers that maybe they need to grow and change for artistic reasons?  As much as we all love Livin' on a Prayer, can't you understand why grown men might want to experiment with that formula and try other things?  The crazy hunger of 20 year olds writing about girls and partying has been replaced by mature men with families, problems and life experiences that they want to share through their music.  If you truly love them and have followed them for years you would accept any direction they chose to go to because that is the music that they believe in and that is the experience they want to share. I love some songs more than others and always have, on every album.  But I accept each album as a unique product of where they are in their musical careers and don't expect a rerun of something they put out 30 years ago.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This app is really cool but it gives you like.....<br />15 to 20 mins you should also look at the real minecraft  game it's AWESOME.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I am new to using the android app, but I'm pretty used to it now. I have not listed anything yet, but that is my next step.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A great series? The movie doesn't do the book justice. But in the other hand I wish they would skip to the last book and make the end movie. So good!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Best Disney movie. No prince charming, just focuses on the relationship of Merida and her mother. Well written. What children should really be thinking about.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Wondferful CD!!!  His voice gets better with age.  I recommend this to everyone, old and young alike.<br />Love, Love, LOve!!!!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|It makes sense and I recommend watching his documentary on BBC before reading the book.  The documentary shows in an engaging way the research behind this way of eating.  I won't really know how valid the whole idea is until I try it myself over a period of time.
B005LAJ17M|5.0|show's a different perspective that I had never considered before. Claire Danes and Damien Lewis do an awesome job playing the characters they portray.
B003L77G6A|5.0|Got on a &#34;black friday&#34; deal, and the price was right.  We love the big bang theory, and have all the seasons.  It's a great show if you're into nerdy humor.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best app you could get. 8 bit graphics give it a fun and unique style. If only there were buckets, fish for fishing, and the ability to play with anyone.  In this app you can hunt, build, destroy, make, and play with friends. I highly reccomend this app!!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Got on a &#34;black friday&#34; deal, and the price was right.  We love the big bang theory, and have all the seasons.  It's a great show if you're into nerdy humor.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A  very good story well written and visual.  This was my first Nicholas sparks book.  I was not disappointed.  Bravo

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am an avid ambient music lover, and I often search for apps that have a variety of soothing noise choises! This app has it all, the ability to create the very best options to soothe your senses and rock you to sleep. The free version is awesome but the paid version is even better, giving you more choices. This app is a must have mind release!!!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I bought this for my daughter as a gift. She simply adores this group! The music isn't wild and hairy. It's just....GOOD music. She has listened to this CD several times since receiving it.
B004P8ITGU|5.0|a year or two ago i was highly recomended this book, and i highly recomend it myelf. the story tells of a young boy who comes from a family of lawyers.<br /><br />theordore is a higly trusted kid in his school. he dreams of being a lawyer and everyone always come to him fo legal help, sometimes even defends them in court.<br /><br />the story tells of a big murder case that has hit a small town in america. theodore is what you would call one of those melding kids, he gets involved with the case  and some small cases along the way. it is really thrilling, a serouis crime book but in the eyes of a 13 year old.<br /><br />i found extremly well written, the writer teases possible romacnes for later sequels, but does not go to into it. theordores love intres i hardly in the book in a couple of secnes. what the writer did well was he devloped the love intrest very well but did not goe too into it whih is really amazing. the book is thrilling and you really get hooked onto the story!<br /><br />it is an amazing book and is well excuted, irecomend it to any teenager lik myself.
0802473156|5.0|I learned alot! Give it to someone who needs help in relationships or just wants to communicate better with their spouse.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The author portrays the reality of the Old South with vivid details and tenderness.  Plots twist and fortunes turn around.
0316067598|5.0|I just wanted to review this because I had no idea such an amazing book would have 4.5 stars. This is one of the greatest books I have found about anything! It makes you really sad thinking of that story. You feel like you know all that happened on the mountain. Thanks Mr. Luttrell for a great book!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a touching story complete with a good moral lesson. The graphics were fantastic and the action very fluid. Oh that hair!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I loved this book it was awesomeness<br />My favorite part of this book is the part where he got the chickenpox
B00007KWHG|5.0|Bought this for my husband. He LOVES it. Says it has all their great songs and he doesn't get tired of listening to it.  Service was good and delivery was fast.
0142001104|4.0|It was not on time, i dont know why, but the service and the state of the book were ok.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|it is alot of fun.  Makes my morning commute to work faster.  It challenges myself to bit my previous score.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|totes awesome. I definitely recommend this game. I'm love this game so much because it's amazing It  has many characters - so addictive!
B0015DROBO|5.0|The first book gets you hooked and the remaining two did not disappoint. Very good read. Can't wait for the movie.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book and I enjoyed it. I think anyone else would enjoy this book. It is a classic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you haven't read this series by now you are missing out on some great reading. Very well written and kept my attention to the end. Love the books!
B005IQZB14|3.0|I enjoyed the book. I know other long distance hikers, including my mother into her seventies. I could see how it was translated from her diaries some years later.<br /> I like her self discovery, but preferred olive kite ridge for the believable and psychological portrayal of so many varied people. This was a different kind of story. I'm glad her life went on to be fulfilled (it sounds like.)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This was a great trilogy and usually these types of series lose something with the 3rd book but this one kept me entertained to the end.
B000W93CHC|4.0|Loved Pillars of the Earth and really enjoyed World Without End because the characters are well developed and there are lots of stories going on at the same time.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Overall this is a great serries and very well written. Can't wait to see the movies if or when they are made.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game really makes you use your observation skills. I just wish it had been a longer game. ended too quick.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|For the length of the book etc. I thought it was a nice read. It has made me interested in other books by the author Mira Lyn Kelly
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was a great story with great plot twists right up until the end.  It felt like the author ran out of time, got tired of writing the story or ran out of clever ideas.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|easy to use and very functional for what I need for my every day use. I would recommend to others
B000002IZ4|4.0|The Stone Temple Pilots' 2nd album is a wondrously colorful workout in arty near psychedelic alt rock. There's a good amount to like here, and thankfully, the Pilots' avoid sounding like Pearl Jam or Alice in Chains while doing so. &#34;Meatplow&#34; makes for a great opening rock song, followed by the rushing and swirling &#34;Vasoline&#34;, which is then proceeded by the near perfect driving anthem &#34;Interstate Love Song&#34;, the twisting bare bones folk rock cut &#34;Pretty Penny&#34;, and the huge country fried loud and quiet workout &#34;Big Empty&#34;. There's one or two tracks that are kinda meh, but overall the Pilots' 2nd album is (at least in my opinion) stronger than the band's debut as a whole and is definitely worth picking up.
B00993G41S|5.0|Light hearted, brain tickling comedy with a great plot.  A bit of a cliff hanger with a great ending. Woohoo!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|What an awesome deal for such an awesome movie!!! Who doesn't love Dr. Seuss and the moral behind the story is one I am so glad my children had a chance to hear. My kids still sit in awe wide-eyed every time I put the movie on
B0094K1MH2|3.0|A good little movie, don't know if its for kids or adults, interesting at times to me, but overall didn't hold my interest, mainly because it just wasn't my type.
B000QFQE4U|5.0|I enjoyed the scenes of his younger life, but his time growing into the men he was when he was fatally shot is motivational. A must see, especially if you think his only premise is \\"by any means necessary\\".
B00B19DMUE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. There was a lot of tense and scary moments. I think it was cool to have an exorcism movie that wasn't catholic. I loved seeing Matisyahu. My husband had played me some of his rap before, so it was cool to see him in this. I thought that Natasha Calis was great. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because quite often it was predictable. I liked the scary moments and the acting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Dowton abbey is so one of the best british shows that is great, just like Sherlock and the tudors, keeps you wanting more. Great romances with just enough drama to keep you hanging but not overwhelming.
B0091REZMW|5.0|my wife and I both have accounts in this app and we love playing whenever we can. thank you very much for the app.
B007PKDW44|5.0|Great group, great disc, would love to see them live sometime but they are always sold out when I see they are coming
B007Y1JGOY|5.0|I like Delain and symphonic metal.  If you do, then you'll probably like this album.  The first time I listened to it I thought I'd only like a couple of the songs, but the rest grow on you.
B001NYPTO4|5.0|I adored the movie and this soundtrack is wonderful! I listen to it all of the time. I'm able to stream it on my computer and with the Amazon MP3 downloader, it's on my computer and MP3 player as well!
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I am not a gamer.  I loaded it for kids to play, so I'm not qualified to rate this.  I hear it is good.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I loved the first novel in this trilogy and had been really looking forward to &#34;Winter of the World&#34;.<br /><br />What Iliked about the first book was the way Follett captured the important things that were happening and how the ordinary people were swept up in them. It seemed he had done loads of research and in particular I found the section dealing with the First World War and its aftermath (Versailles treaty) were very well done.<br /><br />I felt let down by &#34;Winter of the World&#34; because I did not feel I was getting any really well researched continuous history. There were episodic vignettes and an awful lot of credulity stretching coincidences.<br /><br />One of my gripes about Follett's writing is his almost mandatory sexual explicitness which does not really advance the story but sure lengthens the  books! It is not that I am against sex in books, it is just that I prefer it when the sex advances the story rather than being titillation!<br /><br />I am very much in 2 minds as to whether I will even bother with the third book, when it comes out. There are too many good historical novels out there to waste one's time on one that is ultimately unsatisfying.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|This is probably one of Springsteen's best CD's.  Hate his politics but I like his music.  Buy it second hand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game full of challenges. My granddaughter loves the game and if keeps her happy on trips. And I love it also!
B00785P2QC|4.0|It is a great game but one thing that really aggravates is the fact that you must buy investment credits with real cash
0679601686|5.0|Actually a bit better!<br />I got this for my sister because we recently got into P&P. This book was in great quality. Hardcover with a book jacket and no rips or tears. And for a great price too! I was very satisfied.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy to read. Character's easy to picture and to get to know. This may be because of seeing the movie but still well written.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have rarely read a book that left me continually wanting more.  Found the book a most interesting read and if you read the first book, it is a given that you will read the entire trilogy.  I think the second book was the best of the three.
1616550414|5.0|if you are a zelda fanatic like me then please BUY this book because you will love it. You may want to purchase this book soon because i think this book will become rare in the future!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Have watched it countless times. Having lived in London I appreciate its history and this movie is filled with it.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|beach buggy blitz has just become my new favorite  game app.  Been waiting for it....great response and graphics are so vivid. Really fun driving game!!  And best it's free!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|I found it to be interesting, however, I feel she doesn't know who to give credit for her miraculous recovery. She believes it was done mostly by herself and of course the answer should be God!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very challenging and enjoyable. Recommend this one. Definitely not one if those boring downloads!!  And the monkey is just way too cute!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it and I am hooked! It's getting better by the minute and I just can't put the book down!
B007STXHTM|5.0|I use this mainly for snorkeling and occasionally kayaking. This thing is great, it's as sturdy as any other GoPro product. You can use it with out worrying if it's going to leak. Make sure to put a bit of RainX on the lens for shots where you come out of the water.
B001NA2NMO|5.0|I picked this movie solely because it had great reviews, and man am I glad I did! I really enjoyed watching it and about halfway through, I realized I had seen it before but not the ending. Very creepy for its time and wish movies today were this good without all the blood and gore! Good movies CAN be made without it and this is a great example!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I love this show and it hasn't come on in years.  I was ecstatic when I saw it on amazon.  I placed my order and it was here within a few days! Usually after i receive my packages, all the tracking info comes up, this kept me updated every step of the way.  My DVD's are in excellent condition, new in the wrapper package. Overall I am thrilled with this purchase!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love the Muppets and watch this version of The Christmas Carol every year.  It's become a tradition, like White Christmas!
B003719G40|4.0|I like how the book was simple to read with real life examples of how couples worked at their marriages and learned to love each other by speaking their  spouse's love language.  I think that this book will help most people.  Thanks Gary Chapman.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I read some reviews that said this product isn't as advertised. I don't know if those people got the standard dvd or have crazy high expectations but I absolutely loved this product. The colors are great and a lot less shadows and &#34;what's happening moments&#34;...also the sound is significantly improved<br /><br />My girlfriend (who had never seen the series) and I watched this during some frigid winter weekends and she fell in love with, and I was as always hooked at every dramatic turn.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It was a good movie but the ending is not to my liking you never are to violate the one rule with main characters which in a way they did.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Most people have &#34;seen&#34; the Sound of Music movie several times over the years, but you have not truly &#34;experienced&#34; the movie until you watch it on Blu-ray.  The colors and sounds put you right on the hills singing and dancing with Maria.  It really is amazing how different the quality is with Blu-ray.  I am not always so concerned about sights and sounds in movies.  I love black and white movies.  This edition of the Sound of Music really brings this classic movie to life!!<br /><br />The anniversary edition also has several keep sakes that are sure to delight any Sound of Music fan.  Items such as, a hardcover book, hand-painted music box, reprint of 1965 Theatrical Souvenir Book, 45th Anniversary Soundtrack and Six Post Cards are items that you can not find anywhere else.  These make for a truly treasured collectable that you can pass down from generation to generation!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|What a great series! Fantastic costumes, glorious settings and interesting characters - what's not to love?! Can't wait for season 3 to be available in streaming.
0670026638|5.0|Wow, Ruth Ozeki, you hooked me right away with Nao's story.  A Tale for the Time Being by Ruth Ozeki was very different from what I expected (although I have no idea what I DID expect) but it was amazing.<br /><br />I requested this book from NetGalley after seeing the cover everywhere and reading a few positive reviews, like Bookmagnet's post.  A Tale for the Time Being comes out today, and it is one that you really must read.<br /><br />Nao is a Japanese teenager who is just living a crappy life.  She went with her parents to California, where she lived from being a young child to age 15.  The dot com bubble burst, forcing her dad not only out of the job but all of their invested money went down the drain.  Now her dad's favorite hobby is trying to kill himself.<br /><br />Nao is also being bullied immensely at school, being physically tortured, cut, poked, etc.  So if she's worthless, and her dad is going to commit suicide, she might as well try to do the same. . . once she gets her thoughts out on paper.<br /><br />She finds comfort in her grandmother, Jiko, and in her task of writing out what is intended to be Jiko's story, but really turns into Nao's story.<br /><br />How does the reader meet Nao?  Well, fast forward a few years to a remote island in Canada, where Ruth and her husband randomly find some zip lock bags washed up on shore, with Nao's diary, a second diary written by a man in French, and some letters inside.<br /><br />Ruth is captivated by Nao's story, and so was I!  I loved this book and raced through it.  But I have to admit I was much more captivated by Nao's storyline than Ruth's.<br /><br />What book has captivated you lately?<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br /><br />Rebecca @ Love at First Book
B002M9WW30|5.0|Awesome bundle for the price.  Fast and easy delivery process.  Recommend to anyone being a fan of Rocky movies.  Was a anniversary gift for my boyfriend and he loved it! :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I appreciate the perfectly woven blend of attention to historic detail and creative story telling. I anxiously await the new episodes.
B005KLN056|5.0|This blu-ray concert is so electric I had to crank it up on my excellent sound system! All the songs were great......the band is spot on, singer is dynamite and the crowd is definitely into it! Love the coming back to his hometown angle! If you love GNRs , Slash and VR get it what a five star concert! The confetti was a nice touch! DTS 5.1 is very crisp and puts you in the center of the concert!
B008BM9L72|5.0|Brilliantly written. Have an open mind you will enjoy the books.<br />We all have fantasies, and here is a woman who put it down on paper in very beautiful words.<br />Recomemd that everyone reads this book, both men and women.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is an awesome game. A lot of horse games don't actually let you show your horse. This one does. I would definitely recommend it.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is the best app ever. It was totally worth ninety nine cents. I love how I can create memes, I post them on Facebook book and instantly get a billion likes. This game/app is wonderful. I want an update to come out with more features. This game is just so much fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It's just great obviously not as good as the pc minecraft but it is awesome mojang works so hard in it it keeps getting better with the updates it's just cool
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I liked it but the. First two were better<br />.it was a good ending I just thought it lost<br /> way a little in the middle
0425252868|5.0|Once begun it it is near impossible to put this book down. I am an aviator and a WWll historian so A Higher Calling really hits home. I possess tons of factual information about this war, but Mr. Makos allows us a peek into the hearts and souls of these two airmen and their crews and compatriots. I had trouble seeing the photos at the conclusion because of the tears in my eyes.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome levels and its challenging to find the golden objects like the bananas (gold ones).I love the Rio birds their powers rule!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever my cousin showed it to me and I thought wow you play this, but when I played it I was speachless.
6304696558|5.0|I have always enjoyed Goldie Hawn and Eileen Brennan makes the perfect foil to her character. It also has some of the funniest lines in a movie! I can watch this again and again.
B002L3ARRU|1.0|I didi not like it, but my hubby said it's a must see movie. You don't loose anything if you skip it
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|i can't figure out how to use it on my kindle. Will keep trying unless anyone has some help, so not satisfied at all.
B001UGB1X8|4.0|I give only 4 stars because the ending was not as good as I expected, otherwise it was a good movie especially made in Louisiana where I live now.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I enjoyed this story a lot. some of the techno speak was unusual but I learned from it ...great plot
0375704027|5.0|Actually, it is the second Murakami novel I read, but it was the first purchase.  Amazon recommended it to me because I had bought Japanese-themed novels before.  I like Sujata Massey  - basically detective mysteries, and Isaac Adamson -- also mystery novels.  I picked Norwegian Wood because of the cover art and the title.  I enjoyed this book, as I did the Windup Bird Chronicles, which I read first.  After that I bought three others that are waiting to be read.  I like Murakami.  Although basically a dark theme, it is not without joy and pleasure.  Murakami is definitely off-beat, and not afraid to stretch the imagination.  I am looking forward to reading more of his novels.
B009MF56GC|5.0|This isn't some deep story driven action film like you'd get from Cameron. There is hardly a moment where someone isn't getting shot, and it's done the right way. It's awesome, and nostalgic to see all the bad asses back doing what they're meant to do.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've always loved knives since I was young and received my first boy scout pocket knife. These days I carry a knife for all of the same reasons I did back then and more (always keep a good, sharp knife on you, never know when you may need it). The only downside I ever experienced (other than the occasional minor laceration) was that all knives I ever owned would get dull. Just a fact of life, even for the best of them. I was taught how to use a traditional wetstone to sharpen knives with and always thought that there should be an easier way. It can be hard to get the correct sharpening angle by hand and each stroke on the stone that is too steep or too shallow only serves to make an already dull blade worse.<br />  Other sharpening options are either heavy and expensive (electric sharpeners) or cheap and ineffective (little hand sharpeners or blade guide systems). With this in mind I thought that this sharpener would be cheap and unable to do the job. I was wrong. It does a wonderful job of sharpening most normal to thin bladed knives even though at first it appears to be nothing more than any other POS plastic and ceramic sharpener. It is able to reset an edge on highly worn pocket knives in just a dozen passes and restores the razor sharp edge to any tactical clip folder in just a few strokes. Even better the fold out diamond rod is very easy to use to sharpen serrated edges. It can even be used to repair some deep nicks to blades from abuse (not that I would ever abuse a blade but skulls are thick). I have even used it to sharpen a K-Bar Tonto [[ASIN:B000BT1G6W Ka-Bar 2-1245-1 Black Tanto Knife]].<br />  To make a long review short, I keep one in my Bag of Evil along with the two leagal length for daily carry knives it would sharpen. It is idiot proof in use, even for serrated knives. It does a wonderful job sharpening blades. It is inexpensive and compact. I think I'll buy another one so I can store it in my 72 hour bag. 5 Stars, well worth much more than Amazoncharges.
B009JBZH54|4.0|I got this because I like box sets for my movies, and that's why I got this. it does have a lot of extras that collectors, and fanboys would like. However if you already own the other two on blu ray don't waste your money just buy the dark knight rises.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|fun, fast, and quippy. this was a great follow up to born to run. i wish each of the runners in born to run had a written back story.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|As far as a movie goes it's great. But since they sold this to us as a prequel to Alien I'm a very pissed off fanboy. This movie if not sold as a prequel would be really good. So my review is bases on personal opinion. If your just wanting to know about the movie it's pretty good so by all means rent it.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I like the history and  Follett's form of writing.  I have also read Pillars of Fire and World without end.  I could not put them down.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I kept hearing about this book and eventually grew curious to know what was in it. Never before have I been so disappointed. I wonder to myself exactly why women are so captivated and I realize it's purely because this book makes it &#34;okay&#34; to be interested in the bondage subculture. I have a friend who is a bonafide expert when it comes to some of the things touched on in this book and I don't say it casually. She has gone to bondage parties and owns several toys that would put Christian Grey to shame - and this was back in the 90's before it was deemed acceptable by the mainstream. When she mentioned the type of stuff she was interested in and her desire for a dominant man, people would think there was something wrong with her. It's funny how one little book comes along and suddenly that's what women say they want.<br /><br />With all that aside, I didn't enjoy the book because I don't care for E.L. James' writing. I found myself rolling my eyes at the improbability and poor descriptions of what Anastasia was experiencing. I got the impression that E.L. James was writing what she &#34;thought&#34; everything would feel like rather than writing from a place of experience. In other words, she was faking it. I can't take a book seriously when I can tell you haven't been there. It's kind of like the girl who has never had a boyfriend give relationship advice. Yeah, E.L. Have your husband tie you up Christian Grey style, come back with some experience and authority, THEN we can talk. In the meantime, I find your wishful thinking of what you &#34;imagine&#34; BDSM to feel like pretty lame.
B000002H5I|5.0|I scratched my old copy up real bad, so I bought it again. . .I wish CDs weren't going out of style so fast, since I don't have an iPod or anything yet.<br /><br />Lovely music.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|I knew nothing about the Jack Reacher novels until: I heard Tom Cruise was criticized for playing the character, my boss mentioned the upcoming movie was based upon the book, and a friend told me the book was good. I had nothing better to read and figured why not. As a child I was a voracious reader but read less as an adult. That's primarily because nothing has truly grabbed my attention. Outside of the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo series, &#34;Killing Floor&#34; is one of the best suspense books I've read in a long time. For starters, it is very well-written and the characters are fully developed. Lee Child put so much thought into his characters that I felt as though I was reading some of the finest stage direction and could visualize almost everything happening as I read. The plot was logical and based upon the real world so you didn't roll your eyes at the lack of probability. The only reason why I deducted a star from my review is because the book was slow to start. I read the first chapter or two and couldn't get into it because it seemed as though the information was so random. Many times I questioned where he was going with it. Things eventually picked up and I was addicted from that point forward. This is a great &#34;long distance&#34; book, meaning it's a great read when you have quite some time to kill such as a long plane/train ride or on vacation. It's definitely not the type of book you pick up and put down because you'll find yourself getting caught up in the story and what's going to happen next. I can't wait to read the other Jack Reacher novels.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Piscine Patel is a teenager in Pondicherry. He lives with his parents who own a zoo full of exotic animals. When they decide to sell their to some Americans and move to Canada. They get a boat, load up their animals and head to North America where the people for the zoo will pick up the animals. Their boat gets shipwrecked and Piscine is stuck on a lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal Tiger. He and the tiger form a bond of some sorts, he remains in control and eventually tames the tiger. This book is a really well written story that is a real page-turner. It kept me glued to the pages of this book, I didn't know what would happen next, it is a book filled with unexpected twists and turns. I would recommend this book to everyone above 6th grade.
B000FCJZ4K|5.0|A friend recommended this book for her book club. I've never been good at networking and figured why not learn as much as I could. This book was perfect for the &#34;beginner&#34; networker who has no idea where to start. Several of Keith's points resonated with me.<br /><br />Point one: help other people! There's an old expression I've heard that you should be good to the people on your way to the top because they're the same people you'll pass on your way back down. Truer words have never been spoken. I've learned the hard way that when it comes to getting a job or a client, it has nothing to do with what you know but WHO you know. Keith's book addresses that issue. He points out that you should help other people in any way you can even if there's nothing in it for you. If you have two friends who could use each other's help, introduce them to each other. If an acquaintance approaches you and asks if you know of anyone hiring, call up your contacts and see how you can be of help. Yes, you may not know that person well but think about what happens if they get the job. They in turn may be able to help you influence a potential client. It's all about paying it forward with significant dividends.<br /><br />Point two: remember people's birthday! Yes, it might sound juvenile but believe it or not, people actually DO care that you remembered their birthday. It touches their soul more than they care to admit. Keith recommended that when you meet someone ask them for their birth month and day (no year necessary). Technology makes it so simple for you to keep track and actually pops up a reminder on that day. You don't necessarily need to buy flowers or anything expensive, a simple card in the mail, email or phone call will do wonders.<br /><br />Point three: timing is everything! After one of Keith's speaking engagements, several people approached him to say thank you or what not. When he got back to his hotel room an email was already waiting for him. It was from one ofthe guys who had approached him after his speech. Keith pointed out that plenty of thoughtful emails had streamed through his inbox over the next couple of days, but he remembers the very first one he received.<br /><br />Those three are only the tip of the iceberg in what is covered in Keith's book. Again, it's honest advice that you can apply tomorrow for use in the real world. You don't have to be rich or influential in order to benefit from Keith's advice, you just have to want to be personable. GET THIS BOOK!!!!

0385349947|4.0|Even though the book is receiving controversy due to the author's life experiences (seemingly coasting on easy street with big named celebrities), her words stand on their own merit.  She makes a strong case for women claiming their own power and sharing equally in leadership.  I applaud her efforts and encouragement to women everywhere to accept and claim their rightful and necessary equal place in society.<br />--Saira Priest, author, \\"Zen of Hoarding\\"
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The package was in a bubble wrap envelope. The DVD fit just right in the package. There was no damage to the DVD. I was very pleased that the case cover was also in good shape. There were no scratches or nicks.
0062014536|1.0|Here's the problem, you can't finish a series about the freedom to love with a book that has no love in it. What this book should have been about was Alex and Lena finding each other and learning to love the new people they have become after their experiences in Pandemonium while Julian (who, as far as I'm concerned was never a serious romantic rival for Alex) becomes the figure head of the resistance movement. Instead, what I got was Lena pointlessly walking around in the Wilds interspersed with a post-procedure Hana (Hana?!?) ambivalently wondering around Portland kind of feeling guilty about turning in Alex and Lena and kind of not. Another problem, I couldn't care less what is going on with Hana. Instead of wasting time checking in with Hana in Portland we should have been getting Alex's POV on what was happening with Lena and how he was feeling about the whole situation. For some reason, instead of running into each other's arms and never letting each other go again, which is what ANYONE IN THE WORLD would do when a love that you thought was dead is miraculously alive again, Alex is mad at Lena for I'm not sure what and Lena believes him when he says he never loved her so she just continues things with Julian like nothing even happened. And that's pretty much how they go on throughout the book until the end when Lena finally sits down to have a conversation (novel idea there) with the girl she thinks Alex loves who tells her Alex still loves her and never stopped loving her blah, blah, blah. Suddenly she's over Julian and back on the Alex train where she should have been the whole time. Despite all this there is no satisfying conclusion to their love story and, along with a lot of other stuff, we're left to draw our own conclusions on how it all plays out. The end is another big problem for me. After wondering around in the Wilds for the whole book and seeing bombings and massacres by the government I'm supposed to believe that a poorly planned and disorganized group of rebels can pull off a successful coup, tear down the wall and suddenly everything's going to be ok and everyone lives happily ever after? Sorry, don't buy that. Pretty much everything is wrong with this book. It's not the story that should have been told and is a completely frustrating and unsatisfying conclusion to the series. Everything that happens is pointless and irrelevant and ultimately a massive disappointment. I feel about this book how cureds feel about life, disinterested and uncaring. What a waste of time. Verdict: Silver Linings Playbook this mess.group of rebels can pull off a successful coup, tear down the wall and suddenly everything's going to be ok and everyone lives happily ever after?

B000VBJEEG|5.0|The DVD came in very good shape. There were no scratches or nicks the case cover was in very good shape. I had no problems watching the movie. If you like to watch movies then I recommend Amazon. It is the best place to find good deals on movies!!!
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|Another of my favorite films now on DVD.  The Fog is a classic of suspense and terror of the unknown.  Featuring Jamie Lee Curtis and Adrienne Barbeau; the residents of Antonio Bay are preparing to celebrate their town's centennial.  Little do they know the true history of its founding.  And secrets come out - they come out of the fog!  Of course I highly recommend this one.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I love this game. I was mad that it ended so soon. I look forward to playing more games by this company.
B00280LYHS|4.0|Very thought provoking but filled with humor. A great book. A must read for anyone who likes fantasy or science fiction.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is very good it is nice and very simple. Easy to use. I take algebra 1 so of course you will need to use to calculator here and there and it really helps me. Highly recommend buy it you wont regret it. Also it has square root and Pi etc.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|He enjoys it, plays it whenever he can get a hold of my kindle, but does freeze up at times.<br />is this common?
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Very well written as both characters were built up. You are always guessing and not sure whose side to take and then the ending just adds a whole climax in itself. The kind of book I struggled to put down at night!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|wasn't fun, not what i i i thought or expected.<br />i deleted it, did not want to pay to play
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A sensitive exploration of the very ordinary lives and characters in the book and an interesting build up to the climax. I enjoyed the book.
B005FVNIW6|5.0|This book is a beast.  Scott card is a freak.  He knows so much about, and I hate this term buts its the most appropriate, the human condition, is scary.  The book is fun as hell but its themes of leadership, violence, manipulation give it some real depth and their not thrown in clunkily.  its a very fluid experience.  If you want to learn something about yourself something about the what makes us us and want to have a good time doing so.  Read this book and then read it again.  Epic
B007T99ENE|3.0|My first Ian McEwan novel. Not bad for entertainment, but not as good as I expected. Although the plot was intersting and kept me interested through out.
B00BLGXL3U|5.0|I was charged  twice for this rental, please return the  $4.34<br />it was rented and would no play unless I said to rent it again, I obviously only<br />wanted to rent it one time in 24 hours.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is an amazing story.  I saw the movie and read the book.  They are both great. Of course the book is always more satisfying.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Our other one had a break at the plug in so had to order replacement. Well worth the money spent.
0399226907|5.0|This is the first book I bought for my daughter, I've been reading it to her ever since she was born and now she is 8 months and loves story time. This book is a classic and a must have in your child's library.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because I enjoyed every single page. There was suspense, intrigue, and insight into what makes the enigmatic Christian Grey tick. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes romance and surprises. I can't wait to read book 3 of the trilogy.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have not had any problems.  I have been pinning every since I down loaded the app.  I would recommend this product.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I highlighted a lot of things in this book.  Has a great double meaning that only someone with a spiritual tie to God or Gods would understand.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|it was a little slow, was still an okay read. . . . . . . . . . .

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|i gave them this rate because i have now just finished the entire series and they have been really awesome
B008RA3X5E|1.0|At least in the free version the volume worked! I've tried everything! The volume on the device was a maximum. But the app volume kept resetting to silent. Everything else worked fine just not the volume. Thank goodness it's only 99&cent;.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|If you want the story of The Hobbit, read the book. If you want to see an seemingly endless parade of BAD CGI with pointless plot digressions, then this is the movie for you! What doesn't belong in the movie? S***beard the wizard for one is never mentioned in the book.  Neither is the Albino Orc. Why were they added? My only theory is that Peter Jackson wanted to remake the Lord of the Rings trilogy so he took the plot of the Hobbit and has stretched it completed out of shape to fit his bloated ego.    The escape from the goblins is a replay the escape from Moria from Fellowship that was looped repeatedly until you could care less. And it is obviously all CGI and looks so fake, that you expect to see Gandalf swap places with a stuntman on camera. Spare yourself three hours.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|Good game, but a bit too easy.  Maybe make it timed or the number of moves for a star rating would add just that little bit more to it.  But overall a fun, well-done app with the right amount permissions.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Refreshing and often hilarious. It's a tense nail biter with a great premise (stranded on another planet). Starts with a bang and doesn't let up.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I was originally worried about the concept of the book as a set of different interviews, but enjoyed the different perspectives each character was able to give to the story.
B004UPALT6|5.0|This is a classic!  the tongue in cheek Humor combined with the over the top horror affects are hilarious.  Bruce Campbell is one of the only personalities that could pull this off....love him!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I was on a church retreat locked in the hall for three days when Chris was killed. I began reading the book and had not caught up with the news. A friend told me and it put his words in a whole different framework as I continued to read this. I am terribly saddened for his wife and children and for him. To have survived all he depicts here only to be killed by a troubled vet he was attempting to help is just a twisted tragedy. I have thought of him and the other men who have given so much for this country and although I too am a nine year Navy vet, I salute the men who were truly tested and passed. Their combat service deserves recognition and our support as these guys transition back to the world. Hats off to this cowboy...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the app it brings out the kid in me.  I grew up on a farm and have always loved horses
B002PMV9FG|5.0|I buy a lot of dvd;s and they all seem to be shipped within a day or two of ordering. They almost all seem to work well and this dvd was good on both counts.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|My biggest disappointment when I purchased this for Instant Viewing was I thought the movie was actually 3'50\\" long. I purposely made a point to not catch any previews or see any trailers. I'm honestly not to unhappy. I am a true old fan of the books having first read them in the early 70's. The Fellowship et al was beautiful to see, however the story was IMO butchered beyond belief. I am truly a vicious critic and while I could watch the 3 movies I still cringe at some of the directors choices. To be honest he did much the same with the Hobbit, yet this time around it did not matter so much. I'm not here to rant or rave about fps or all the other silliness. Hey I'm watching on a 20\\" TV (not HD) at my comp. The movie was very entertaining - killed almost 3 hours very nicely after work and left me waiting for the second real. $15 bucks was well worth the investment and I'll watch at least once more with a fairly newbie mindset. If you want or demand the big screen effect well there are still theaters to go to. I however enjoyed this very much - it isn't the book verbatim but honestly The Hobbit or LOTR is realistically way beyond the capacity or ability to do as written. Enjoy and if you never have before--- afterwards treat yourself to the real treasure - THE BOOKS!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie has helped me to explain and understand Autism better, showing  how her mind views the World in pictures. Clare Danes and the cast did a wonderful job. The real Temple Grandin is also featured in the extras.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Got to love the birds! One of my favorite games. Upgraded to a smartphone just to play Angry Birds. Wow!
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|can't stop playing this game. the graphics are great. it's fun building the village as you go along. a game for all ages.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is addicting when u start playing u don't want to stop. Good colors easy game to play.  5 stars for sure.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Very touching movie. Makes you think. The acting is courageous. Similar to My Left Foot. It's probably not a movie for everyone but I loved it.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I got this app not expecting much cause it was a shark game, but after playing almost all night and unlocking the hammerhead, I love it. Pros: Nice graphics, it is completely free with the exception of the in app store, and it has lots of fish eating and human eating action. Cons: it is not really a free to roam world,it's more like a connection of large levels, you must continuously eat fish or you will starve, and in game gold is received very slowly. There has been no adds so far and the game doesn't pester you with in app purchases. It's very fun and should be in your game collection. [...] . Thanks!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|This book isn't worth reading. I kept reading this book, in the  hopes  it would get better but it never did.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is awesome. Pros: Addictive and hard to put down, nice graphics, great controls, fun sound affects from the monkeys and money pick up, the game is completely free it doesn't require you to purchase in game currency to get the character skins and upgrades, doesn't require an internet connection to play. Cons: there are none. Please get this app, you won't regret it, and join the thousands of other players competing for high scores. Best free app ever. Thanks for reading my review, and please hit the helpful button if this review helped you with the purchase of this app. Thanks :)
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|This CD is an excellent showcase of just how adaptive Korn has become over the years - while Nickelback, Linkin Park, and many others have failed to succeed in adapting to demand and changes, Korn has shone through with this latest entry in their catalogue of albums. Though it is a bit too 'techno/industrial' for me, I still love the sound that Korn has produced here. I highly recommend this album.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book is super good and I recommend it to anyone who likes huckleberry Finn or anymore of mark twain 's books. This book is super funny and can be tense and serious at times. But this is a wonderful book!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|While not as good an album as their past two, Maroon 5 has yet again produced another winner. There are many songs on this album that are worth the collective expense to purchase it, my favorite being &#34;Sad&#34;. If you like Maroon 5, this cannot be left out from your collection.
B00AU2B0DE|5.0|This young man has real talent and is going to be around for a long, long time. His acoustic performance of his very successful Believe album is so well done!!
1616550414|5.0|This is an absolute must have for Zelda fans out there - especially aspiring or existing artists that are fans of the series.
B001A3CP5Y|5.0|This album has stood the test of time and rightfully so. Five of Rock's best joined up to become the Traveling Wilburys and brought us a sound that is at the same time new and as comfortable as your favorite sweater. Do your rocking heart and soul a favor and treat yourself to the Traveling Wilburys. Amazon gives you some of the easiest and painless ways to do it.
1591844096|3.0|Seth Godin is easy to read. Easy to follow. That's why he has gobs of followers. The man talks to everyone. Linchpin: Are You Indispensable? (Portfolio/Penguin; 2010) is no exception. The book gets right to it: there's one idea where Karl Marx and Adam Smith agreed--our society is comprised of two divisions, management and labor. Godin proposes a third: the linchpin. This new classification is the result of economic evolution. Many of us see the linchpin as the independent contractor. Godin prefers to call him an artist with a gift. In fact, two of Godin's bibliographies used for this book (by Lewis Hyde and Marcel Mauss) have the same title: The Gift. In any case, Linchpin is a protest against what we were all trained to become: a cog. But you can break from the machinery if \\"your art is important enough to overcome the resistance you face.\\"<br /><br />Another smart-sassy-success-seminar-type contribution from Mr. Godin. Filled with snappy headers and jazzy illustrations on every page. Preachy over practical--but a good one at that.<br /><br />--Tom Field
B0097EWK3A|4.0|It was fun a little complicated but not to bad. I played it more than once. I am ready for part 2
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love match games and this is one I can play on my kindle yay<br />Keep them coming<br />Thank you
B001DCQI9G|5.0|Everything about this box set is perfect: sound quality, packaging, text and most of all the performance.  It is a welcome addition to any collection.  You cannot go wrong for the price.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fisdom is a very fun and challenging game. I downloaded it on my lap top also a year ago and am at level 70, playing it every now and then when I have time. Each level is harder and harder but the game is addicting. My only problem with the Kindle version is the small size, it doesn't take up the whole screen like the other games that I have. I wish they could change that part somehow. It is a 3 in a row game and you earn money with each level you finish then you can buy fish, filters, feeders etc. and things to decorate your tank with. I recommend it just because it's fun to play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it and you will to I am a kid all kids love it all my friends love it there are super boxes
145162445X|4.0|An absolute mind-blowing moment from the book comes when Krauss explains that the star stuff that constituted one's right hand is probably different star stuff than what's in the left hand!  That little nugget was reason enough to buy the book but there's so much more.<br /><br />Krauss explains in a pretty sophisticated way how the universe came about.  (I write \\"pretty sophisticated\\" because the science can get a bit involved but Krauss has a nice way of bringing it back down to earth.)<br /><br />For anyone looking to get a bang out of the \\"big bang\\" - well then this is the book for you.  (Whether you enjoy puns or not.)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I love this show.  We can't get enough of it so we bought the season pass.  Highly recommend it!
B0055Q5F36|5.0|This outterbox is great for anyone who wants to protect their phone without sacrificing the unit of being thin.  I can still fit my phone in my pocket with the case on.  It is also very easy to put on and take off, which is why most people don't like these cases.  With this commuter series case you will not have that problem.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this game is very exciting as well as challenging! It is not as easy as it looks and you really feel good when you win./(
075669812X|5.0|great book,  IT explains very well all the ninjago story, it has a lot of figures, very entertaining, my kid loves it! an dit comes with a real figure
B002QE3CTY|2.0|Such potential but the characters were flat, dialog was badly done, characters responses to situations was wrong and illogical. What the heck was the character Teresa in the story for except for a gratuitous female. She spent over half the book in a coma, a quarter of the story in prison. There was no point to her and Thomas's telepathy. Argh, I could go on and on. Target group must be middle school boys, but I think they'd rather be outside playing ball
B0091REZMW|4.0|I like it and its entertaining. its easy to learn.  its something to do while sitting around. I love hidden object games.
B00119ZMKW|5.0|I have probably watch this whole series a dozen times now. Sadly, there has not been as great of sci-fi shows since. They need to make another movie.
0307730697|5.0|This book is one for the history books. this book will leave you with joy sadnss and inspiration for eveyone. Cannot express enough about this book.
B000JMKNVK|3.0|Easy to read.  Great characters, good story.  Hard to put down.  I recommend this book to all fans of great storytelling.
B007G92QGO|4.0|A really good thoughtful book that pulls you along for the whole journey.  If enjoy a subtle thriller/drama/crime type story this will tick all the boxes!
B00BQVHCH6|4.0|Big Bang Theory is one of our favorite sitcoms.  The writers are<br />incredibly creative and of course the actors are cast to a tee.<br />You can't help but smile after watching any episode.  This episode<br />was no exception...it was great.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Love the twists and turns.  Lost me a bit at the end because I wasn't sure how true it ran but a great entertaining read!
B00899F0G8|5.0|I am addicted to this show , and although it is overpriced in my opinion, I loved every second of it.
1416550550|3.0|My rating is NOT based on the content of the book, but rather on the publication of the book.  While in the midst of reading, the print on pages 349 and 360, were completely grayed/faded out so much that I could not even read the pages.  The book was published by Washington Square Press, which is a trademark of Simon and Schuster.  Very disappointing.
B003DWC6LI|5.0|I confess, I love this book and I totally had the movie in mind when I was reading it--it was one of those rare cases where seeing the film first didn't spoil the book for me. It's so on the spot about being single and feeling fat (although I was shocked to find out that Bridget's 'fat' weight was something like 57 kg/125 lb!), and at the same time redemptive and reassuring that there's still hope, you could still find a Mr. Darcy. Coupled with my love of Pride and Prejudice, it's a great fun read and I finished it in a night.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|it is a lot like the mario game but does not work the greatest on the kindle fire that I have it is not like the wii or any other game counsel.
B007MCTTHY|1.0|its so dumb i hate it its super boring whats the point of it!<br />in the game all you do is put tubes together you dont even get prizes! my point is that it is boring
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love the pictures. Very detailed. I have purchased many of these. This one is one of my favorites. Keep up the good work.
B008SVS3FC|3.0|I find John a fabulous song writer but like his songs sung by someone who has a stronger, more pleasant voice...like Bonnie Raitt.<br /><br />She has the credibility to do his  thoughtful songs justice
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is the program I needed to get fast and easy youtube videos and music. It fits very well into my best expectatives.
B00BKEMX28|5.0|I like the range of emotion, and the atmosphere of sounds. This album is just what i needed, the vocals are understated, and in this age of american bombast \\" hey look at how amazing and talented i am \\" its refreshing to hear some one is makeing music that isnt about oneupmanship. Hope fully it translates well live im looking forward to the tour.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I haven't seen the movie but this trilogy was all I needed. I couldn't put it down till the last page....  both times that I read it.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The Secret was a joy to read<br />It shows that there is always hope love & faith<br /><br />Children bounce back easily
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Love it good way to learn how to take care of horse without getting hurt. Also good for intercity kids that cannot get out on farm. Learn about chores too. Helps if you always wanted a horse but always been allergic....
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Like the first two, it took me a while to get through reading them, partly because I only read while in tub or for a few minutes when I go to bed. I didn't feel like it was pulling me into the book. Don't get me wrong, it had a great story plot, but nothing was screaming, &#34;hey read me, never put me down&#34;. I enjoyed the love story behind it more than the sex stuff, maybe I am more twisted than that idk lol<br /><br />I would like to actually see a sequel with Elliot and Kates view and possibly what happens with Etan and Mia.
B007SOQBCM|2.0|I am a streamer on twitch so when I found out here was an app I got all excited I thought after I streamed I could relax and watch my friends stream off my kindle. I can but there's no way to sign in or chat this is a major bummer
B007J4T2G8|5.0|See my review for book three. Was a good read, but took me a while to get through the books.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|love the color and sound, graphics are wonderful on my kindle fire hd, its a fun way to pass the time
B007IXWKUK|5.0|See my review for book three. Was a good read, but took me a while to get through the books.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like it, it gives u the information u need and want. Nothing fancy its just one of those app you cant have your kindle without.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Others have written more eloquent reviews here than I ever could, the only thing I can contribute is that this music takes me RIGHT back to my early teen years in the mid-to-late 60’s (a bit of nostalgia).<br /><br />What impresses me most is the musical talent demonstrated on this collection.  Considering the time period (long before all the electronic “gadgets”) this was an extremely talented group that spawned numerous big-name groups:  Poco, Loggins & Messina, Crosby, Stills & Nash (later CSNY), Neil Young, Stephen Stills (solo).  Just listening closely to the music itself - how tight their sound was, the chord choices, instrumental arrangement on “Expecting to Fly” never fails to impress me, even 45 years later.  Just some really great, well put together music by some incredible musicians.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is so fast and cool. It tells you if the person has read  your message And tells you when they are typing. Its also super fast and i love it. Get it if you want something actually worth your time.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. You really learn where Apple came from, how they got to where they are today and what the company went through with Steve Jobs. All the stories you've heard of how difficult it was to work with Jobs are true! The author kept me engaged in the story of Steve's life. I would recommend this to anyone who has a love for Apple products.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really a nice game. Just challenging enough to keep you interested. Not too difficult though. Nice graphics and storyline. I love this type of game. Think the price is a little high but overall a good game.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love Downton Abbey Season 3.  Can't wait for the next season!  When will you have the next season?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|It's hard to describe my feelings about this book.... Clearly written, a haunting,sad and yet beautiful story..one I would read again.
B009HOU672|5.0|I adore the Four Seasons as millions of people do and it is a very enveloping and healing piece of music.  I can always get back to center listening to it.  It has helped me my whole life since I was a teenager.  I heard this on NPR and went wild for it.  It's a sublime masterpiece and a work of love and deep appreciation that gives me even MORE of this gorgeous work to savor and love.  It is pure genius.  I have not stopped listening to it since I got it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A very historical book with a riveting story. One I couldn't put down. I can't wait for the third one to come out.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Another smash hit from Pixar.  Iwouldrate the third version as 2nd best.  The first was a little hued with anger when buzz and woody meet. The second is the best then followed by the third because they develop new characters...still a must see.
B000002L5I|5.0|I had this so long ago it is long gone so I bought a new one and I just love it
B005PK56TA|5.0|Unlike any other horror movie out there...a horror that actually gets to develop a character over more than a few minutes like a regular movie would
B005LAII12|5.0|My daughter and I saw this in the theater and she had to have it for Christmas she loved it so much
B00170M2JY|5.0|The movie that picks up the values from within yourself and puts them to test in real life to show that you deserve a chance to live the life you chose, and with a lot of success, if you keep true to your own goals.
B00821BLX4|4.0|If you plan on changing lenses frequently or spontaneously, you should get one adapter per lens; it's much faster than using the threads.<br /><br />Yes it is expensive for what it is, and should have been made of metal. (Thus loss of 1 star)<br /><br />I have purchased this OEM ring, as well as the Rainbowimaging clone. This OEM model has a slightly more secure attachment to the camera body, so I personally prefer it for that peace of mind. It also comes with a 40.5mm lens cap. I use my Rainbowimaging adapter with a cheap UV protector filter to protect the lens.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Additional obstacles which makes it all the more fun and addicting! I like the differences made in the game except for the giant demon monkey that's in it. -.-
B003MC5N28|5.0|I was looking for something different and this book delivered. Based in future times and I loved it. I recommend this book.

1585104205|5.0|With the available resources this is the friendliest Latin program available.  I have used and looked at other programs but the way this program is meant to be used is superior to all.  The student reads Latin from the start (which is motivating) and uses the deductive methods, working out the meanings of many things, but at the end of each chapter is a summary of the grammar learned in each chapter.  Even though the summary is in Latin (everything is) you can translate it easily.  I have had parents looking at the textbook for the first time able to translate the first chapter just using the clues in the sidebars.  Each chapter advances in grammar which you learn in the story by using it.  It is friendly enough to use with upper elementary students. All Latin study is rigorous but this program takes the \\"tedious\\" out of studying Latin.
B002DQLGHU|5.0|The Harry Potter serious are some of my favorite movies.  I own them all on DVD and still decided to purchase them from Amazon so I could have access to them on my ipad, Roku and computers.  Amazon movies and television are a great option because you can download them for use without high speed internet or steam them without downloading.  Whatever your needs are at the time.
B000002KIK|3.0|...one really has to have the rest of the collection before buying this one. What I mean to say is that if you have all but say, Sabotage, Vol 4 or Never Say Die - buy the others first.  It is not a bad album, but it isn't better than ANY of the prior ones.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Installing it on my android as we write. I need a back up for my snooze button. Use my clock my phone now my android, I'm in trouble.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This arrived at the store looking both ominous and inviting, so I had to take it home. Looks were not deceiving. This is a masterpiece. This is a band on a whole other level. I'm still attempting to orient myself as to what precisely this level is, but I have not been able to stop listening to it for over a week. My world shifted perceptively the first time I played it, and I must pursue it relentlessly to discover who I am becoming.<br /> This music has entered me and is crawling around in my head, day and night. This may be the most noticeably altered I have become since I first heard the Beatles. But their's was a music of sunshine and celebration, an opening up to the world. This is the music of darkness; a silky wandering through a dark neon valley where the things they hide from children (and themselves?) are now in open view. (\\"Night divides the day.\\")<br /> Who are these people? The singer is named Jim Morrison, and his dark baritone voice is like the devil whispering into my ear. What is he saying? (\\"Kill! Kill!) The band sounds like it could have played at Hitler and Eva's wedding. It's lush and romantic, but with a dark, sexual allure that covers the ultimate night of death.<br /> The album opens with an invitation: \\"Break on through to the other side.\\" But what is over there, and do I really want to go? There are two long songs. One celebrates love and lust with instruments that spin in a mad whirlwind of ecstasy (\\"Try to set the night on fire!\\") The other is a trip deep into someone's brain that I am afraid might be mine. It's like entering a strange desert or a jungle with a madman for a guide. The music slides in and around while the voice chants either your desires or your nightmares. Perhaps it's both, and then they shift places. The singer ends up killing his father and doing what with his mother? This is disturbing, but equally compelling. How are you supposed to respond to this? (\\"The blue bus is calling us . . .\\")<br /> The short songs are great, most of them about sex (\\"I want to sleep all night in your soul kitchen\\"), dreams (\\"Before you slip into unconsciousness\\"), more dreams (\\"Take the highway to the end of the night\\"), whisky, more sex (\\"I'm your backdoor man\\"), (\\"She's a twentieth century fox\\") and destiny (\\"'Cause it's too late\\"). Some of them are brutal, all of them are beautiful. This is poetry, but it's not Dylan's poetry; it's too haunted for that. This is seduction, but it's not Jagger's; it's mysterious, not cocky.<br /> The band sounds like they are playing hypnotized. There are strange keyboard solos everywhere, the guitar just floats, the drummer is in a daze. Every sound fits perfectly with the words. Just who are these guys? Is everyone in California going insane? I've got to get out there. Raylan and I were listening last night, and he agreed to definitely drive us this summer. Yes, there's something happening, and I don't know what it is. But I've got to find out. I want to \\"speak in secret alphabets.\\"<br /> I lie by the fire in the den, these songs swirling around again before I go to bed. I have to keep the volume low - mom and dad can't hear this, or they'll take it away from me. No, they can't take it away . . . \\"Cause it's too late.\\"<br /><br /> P.G., age 17<br /> January 1967
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Terrific action and even a bit sentimentality from &#34;M&#34; towards the end. I especially enjoyed the back story of where 007 grew up.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|The cast is fantastic!  Definitely a keeper!  What a value for your money with the DVD, Blu-Ray, and Digital copy.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Well the title says it all, this is one of my favorite apps I really recommend it for jpark fans or just someone who wants a dinosaur park game. This app uses FaceBook as a \\"port \\" for playing the game but there is also another option.<br /><br />Now to the facts : First off we have the engine and it is a normal builder based engine,Secondly the goals , they can be fun yet but a little annoying.<br />Last is how its played, you scroll with your finger click with your finger and so on but it is very touchy so beware that problem but then again it may just be my tablet.<br />Also its a coin based game so of course you need to \\"earn \\" your coins of cource there is money bought with real money but here's the cool part YOU CAN ALSO EARN THEM now isn't that AWESOME.  -from a child that admires all the movies and the work done to make JURRASIC PARK
B00633W614|4.0|My first in the series. Was kinda confusing with all the different locales & characters, but I couldn't put it down & it mostly all came together.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|We enjoy playing this game! It's fun for all of us from 8 to 80! The zipline and monster chasing you if you trip add intensity to the game.
014241543X|5.0|I really didn't think a book where the main character is in a coma for 90-95% of the book would be worth the read--WRONG. This book is! If I Stay will is an emotional, thought provoking story that will tug at your heart strings.<br /><br />The author did a wonderful job a switching between the present and Mia's memories of past events. Mia's emotions and her ultimate dilemma come through loud and clear to the reader.<br /><br />\\"I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard.\\"<br /><br />After having so much ripped away from her in a matter of seconds, Mia has a decision to make. Is life worth really coming back to?  This book is based on that one simple question. Although this is Mia's ultimate dilemma, this story had me pondering my thoughts about life/death. What would I do in Mia's situation?<br /><br />Not only is this book emotional and thought provoking, it's also very inspiring. I can't express how wonderful this book really is. To understand you really have to read it--and I suggest that you do.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Glitched out the whole device had to delete and reboot . PIECE of trash software, WORSE THEN WORTHLESS -  HARMFUL

B0012QTT4O|1.0|I don't usually rant about TV shows. But I found these censor edits WAY too distracting to watch any more of this show.<br /><br />They say the DVD version is uncensored - Unfortunately, I've been soured on the whole experience. I sadly bought the entire season, and I have no desire to watch any more seasons. I'm sorry some people don't like the fact that I didn't appreciate the censorship. But this is America, not everybody has to enjoy having their art ripped apart because someone thinks they shouldn't hear a word or see an image.<br /><br />And what is MORE annoying is not only did they somehow THINK that distracting the audience by deleting words and blurred out shots would somehow make you like the show more, the things they choose to censor are bizarre. For example, apparently in their minds it perfectly OK to say the words \\"F*gg*t\\", Sh[..], Bit[..] and Bulls[...] however, showing showing a women's breasts for 1 second is somehow a horrible sin. WTF!!! Seriously, Who are these people?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really good i think quite a rare game that is so good and is free you can do all kinds of stuff like get new characters new boards and upgrades this is a must have game :)
B008OOYALE|4.0|I really enjoyed this cute little game. I like how you can put the game down for a week and nothing will go bad unlike a lot of other apps out there. Fun to play with friends as well.
B005HSG3VK|3.0|I wanted something that would protect the face of the kindle but other that the case is ok and I like the color
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good and addictive entertaining exilerating fantastic perfect for children really like it exceptional acceptable this review is pointless since I must write 30 words. POINTLESS!!!! -_-
B0049J3QAY|5.0|I have children ages 2-7 and they all love this movie! Highly recommended. This is one movie I won't mind watching again.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Very catcher in the rye like story about a genius freshman finding himself. Told in a letter format to an anonymous reader. Honestly not sure how I felt about the story, it was thought provoking but strange all the same.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book has many twists and turns, but I gladly follow its paths. The plot and subplots keep me interested and guessing. The sex is quite stunning but this book is not just another pretty face. There must be plot to hold my interest. I look forward to reading book three.
B0057VDGNK|4.0|I was tempted to give this a 3-star rating, but I just don't believe it deserves that, regardless of my qualms. I'm not going to expressly review each song, because everyone knows that they're all fantastic. What I must mention, however, is that the album itself is terribly put together. All the licensed songs are placed at the beginning of the album, and Cliff Martinez's score is at the end. This makes for a poor 'album flow', and it feels very cheaply put together. Besides that small issue though, the music itself is fantastic. Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love the selection of reading plans available, and that if I choose to read a few days worth at a time ... I can update my plan to sync to where I read last. Still figuring out the community and sharing features.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have reviewed a lot of games.... and thievish at the top of the charts. better that temple run one and two, even better than minecraft. I love this game. What's the catch? there isn't one :) what are you waiting for? go get it! :]~Azia&lt;3
B007CI81IQ|2.0|This review really consists of two parts, the first being the Kindle version of this book; the second part being the content of the book.<br /><br />Just to set the stage, I read this book on a Kindle Fire HD, so this was not read on a computer with the Kindle App or on an Apple product with a Kindle app.  Thus, I should have had all of the features of a Kindle book available to me.<br /><br />With that in mind, this is a very poor excuse for an e-book.  Here are some specific examples:<br /><br />* The Preface of the book is located at the end of the book, just before the Index.<br />* The Index is useless.  It is strictly a list of terms without any page references of hyperlinks.<br />* Chapters are NOT numbered but they are titled.<br />* Graphs are very fuzzy and almost unreadable when you enlarge them enough to see.<br /><br />Just in case this was a problem with Kindle Fire HD, I also opened it in my Ipad using the Kindle app and it has the exact same issues.<br /><br />Content of the Book:<br /><br />I was hoping for a better understanding of Global Poverty and the problems that we have solving it and I was expecting a very scientifically based report with balance.  What I found was another book where the authors have an agenda and they will select information to suit their agenda and reject any information that runs contrary to it.  One specific example is how they deal with micro loans and what they expect from micro loans.  Where in the definition of micro loan does financing a medium to large company come into play?  Yet, that is one of the things they criticize micro loans for is that they do not loan enough to create a company that has hundreds of employees!  They can find several examples of poorly run lending, but NEVER do they once mention KIVA or any of the work that the organization does to ensure the problems they mention are eliminated!  Once again, if you can select the data you will you, you can prove anything you want to prove.<br /><br />The authors also do a bit of research on the poor and their habits and then glibly contrast it against what they expect the non-poor would do.  Do they actually do any research on this?  No!  They just assume that this is what must happen and this is what people who are not poor must think! (The authors actually state \\"one presumes that this must be what the non-poor think\\".<br /><br />There is very little recognition of cultural differences in what people think makes them poor, wealthy, happy, or sad.  But I guess that is to be expected since they authors never really define what they mean by \\"poor\\"!<br /><br />The scary part about this book is not its content, but the fact that it is written by two recognized economists that happy to also be providing guidance to the United States on how to deal with Global Poverty!<br /><br />While I think this book is poorly researched and written, I do believe that it is important to read because these are the people who are guiding our government to spend money to solve global poverty without ever asking the people on the ground who work with poverty day in and day out what they need or what they think!  No wonder we spend so much money and get so little back in return!authors also do a bit of research on the poor and their habits and then glibly contrast it against what they expect the non-poor would do.

B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I liked this game quite a bit, and wince I'm a total game critic (I have something for nearly EVERY game), it came as a nice surprise not to have one to rate super low. I like it:]~Azia&lt;3
B002ZG999U|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie and do so every now and then.Personally,there are Great parts and some that are Bad parts but the Good parts are the movie .Mickey Rourke does an Excellent job as the owner of Tools' Tattoo's and should have had a much bigger part (you see it and you'll agree). Sly,Mickey,Dolph,Eric and Jet all do a Very Good job.As far as I am concerned Steve Austin should have stayed in the ring.He says just that in part of the \\"back scenes\\" part of the DVD.Dolph is the Loose Cannon and Sly shoots Him \\"2 inches above the Heart\\" and ... well You will see.I remember growing up and watching Westerns on T.V. and back then the Good Guy could put 6 shots into the Bad Guy and He would fall down.Now,1 shot from one of these firearms and the guy is blown in half, You will see that also.I really like these movies where the main Dudes are in their mid- 60's...maybe because I am.
0802136834|4.0|When I bought this book, I thought it was going to be a typical historical biography, but (in my humble opinion) it was written like a story.  I found myself staying up late to read it even thought I already knew what was going to happen.  I have to admit that Catherine of Aragon and Anne Boleyn's story had me more glued to the book than anything.<br /><br />Finally getting to the last wife (Kathering Parr) I learned some things about Elizabeth I that I thought were very interesting.  I am going to order Alison Weir's book on Elizabeth I to get more details.<br /><br />In conclusion, I really did enjoy this book.  Hated when I got to the end.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The is THE VERY BEST series EVER written! I can't get enough of it. I couldn't wait to preorder the next series. The only problem is sometimes the BluRay settings have changed and you have to adjust your player to be able to view this cd.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very different than the ones I have read before, it was better in the way that I didn't want to stop reading. It is a fantastic book and everyone should read it.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I LOVE all things Jane Austen so I HAD to buy this! This cd did not disappoint. It is so well done from the acting, the actors, and clothing to bringing Jane Austen alive. A must had for anyone who loves Miss Austen!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Better that the first!! Ready for what is to come in the next 2 books. All books should be movies!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Holy cow this was a great read but for some reason made me a little OCD hmmm I wonder why? Could it be because of Lee! I caught myself more than once making sure my own front door was locked. This was a hard book to put down..
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Movie was fun to watch. Characters were hilarious. Music was sing a long and the choreography was great.<br />It's especially fun to watch with a group of friends for a sleep over. My high schoolers and college age kids enjoyed it immensely and watched it twice in one day. They had a great time.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|They say the past is prologue and the focus of this story is what happens when banks rule everything and human rights are destroyed in the name of progress for fortune.  I found much commonality with the plight of modern Americans dealing with dwindling jobs and subject to the whims of the banking industry described as &#34;the monster that needs to be fed&#34; within the book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A film with both Maggie Smith and Judy Dench has a prima facia attractiveness, which Marigold Hotel delivers throughout.  India is not a favorite story locale for me, but the local customs and color work well in this case.  Smith portrays a middle class version of Downton's Violet who makes charming adjustments by the end, and Dench does wonders with a widow who has been left in doubtful straits.  The author's creation of a cross section of British seniors (who become residents of an Indian hotel converted to retirement home) is perfectly cast, the owner/manager of the Jaipur hotel is a delightful rascal, and the hotel itself is an interesting character.  As with any serious comedy, there are plot resolutions that disappoint as well as please the viewer.
B000J103WK|5.0|This is a 2-DVD set concert performed by one of the best groups spanning the majority of the age of rock and roll. You will recall their first songs from the very early 70's up through their latest additions in recent years.  Their talent hasn't faded.  This is not just a rock group. It is a rock orchestra with every single one of the multi-talented twenty some group members standing out in their expertise with the instruments that display their individual talents.  We put the DVDs in for a nice long Saturday evening of listening and watching - yes watching the talent of these people as they perform.  The entire concert in Melbourne Australia is pulled off beautifully and if you've lived through the epic period of rock and roll you will find yourself saying &#34;Did they play every song ever heard on the radio?&#34;  A magnificent DVD set we wouldn't be without and when the set we have wears out, we will order another.  It's sad that in today's world, music appreciation is no longer pushed in elementary and high school for we've begun to make excellent, multi-talented instrument playing and music orchestrating a thing of the past. Watch these DVDs and see if you don't agree.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it is very useful and kool!!! u can see exactly how much battery u have left. get this app! you can also make a costing Colorado for your battery
0061122416|5.0|Just read it !! This was a great buy and so enlightening without it being one of those self help type books.
B002OEBMN4|4.0|Combines the intensity of Reign in Blood with intricate lyrics and monster guitar work. Highly recommended. Get your kids started on this one while they're young!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This is a fun game & the graphics are pretty. Though, if you refuse to shell out real money like me, it can get painfully slow. I've found it to be a pleasant waste of time!<br /><br />FYI: I did not get any game cash for my review. So if you were wondering, you will not be rewarded for your review (maybe a 5 star one does?).
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved this game!!!!  Awesome...even though I hate clowns and carnivals, I loved this game...the puzzles, the storyline etc.<br />Great job G5. Keep 'em coming.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Great cinematography, soundtrack, theme, casting, and of course acting! I watched it 3-4 times after I received it! Definitely great for anyone's collection.
1401223176|5.0|Jim Lee is the best Batman artist around. Very good read so glad I picked this up could not put it down until I was done.
B001QB5S3G|2.0|The plot line in this film is preposterous.  It never happened.  Besides that it is an insult to the native peoples who knew well how to fight a guerrilla war.  All they had to do was swim under water for 50 yards or so and upset the Spanish canoes and the muskets would have been useless. Also the scene where the young native says the devil lives in the jungle is beyond ridiculous.  Their home was the jungle.  OK my fault I expected a lot more from this film. Excellent cinematography and good acting can't save this film.  The native actors and actresses at least got some work.  They were the best part of the film. The musical score is as out of place as the plot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My opinion about this game is that it's really fun to play and if your a horse person then u should toutally try this game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|OMG THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!! I love this game so much! It's so addictive.....if u wanna have a good time play this game
B0041OT9W6|5.0|A good book, the view of a young girl caught up in a tumultuous time in history. Anne grows up and develops throughout her diary. It is really more of a story about growing up than a history lesson.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|i was interested since this young man was recently killed by an american , while he was helping him with his ptss, i was compelled to read his story. very well written. rest in peace Chris.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I guess some people want the movie to be exactly like book.  Sad sad sad sad sad sad sad sad
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have not had this app long, I but I like the app so far. It has been easy to use and I enjoy playing it in my spare time. I wish there was more tack and accessories available at more reasonable cost. I would suggest it since its free to my friends that like horses.
0767821769|5.0|Very pleased with my order of this movie! It came when it was supposed to and was just as I expected it to be!
B000FCK65W|5.0|I read this when I was 12 or 13 but didn't really remember liking it or even remember much about it.  As a grown woman I don't know if I would let my daughter read it at that age because there is a lot of adult stuff that maybe I just didn't get then. I have to say I really enjoyed re-reading this book as an adult. I hated to see it end, which to me is a book worthy of a high rating.
B0002VFXFE|4.0|I used this during a CPU upgrade so have no before and after data to compare, but the temperature of my fan exhaust is hotter yet the CPU temp cooler than with the OE thermal pad used before.  It was easy enough to apply I didn't have to clean up excess.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Love the look. Only complaint is you can't not wear it for an extended period, but that is to be expected for an automatic.

B003F3FJQO|5.0|Amazing book it is a book with action and it is a great 2nd book but what is the third book
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I had a hard time getting into this book.  I feel it was the set up for the next book &#34;Shadow of Night: A Novel. (all Souls Triolgy&#34;.  I started getting interest in the last part of the book.  I am about half way through the second book and some of the stuff from the first book is making sense.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I haven't followed Bowie's career too closely despite playing one of his greatest hits collections pretty regularly and appreciating that classic '70s \\"Peace On Earth/Drummer Boy\\" duet with Bing Crosby every Christmas, but he's at least a couple generations removed from mine. After \\"China Girl\\" on MTV and after his appearance as the Goblin King in the Jim Henson film Labyrinth he mostly fell off my radar as the '90s took hold. Still heard him through a lot of his music being covered by some of the bands of my generation (i.e. - The Cure with \\"Young Americans\\", Nirvana with \\"The Man Who Ruled The World\\", Bauhaus with \\"Ziggy Stardust\\", and more recently The Bravery with \\"Sorrow\\" and M. Ward with \\"Let's Dance\\"), so my appreciation managed to keep growing through those years. And I think his appreciation for my generation's icons kicked in as well, from being in some of my favorite movies like Zoolander and The Prestige to celebrating his 50th birthday in a concert with some of my favorite artists, Robert Smith (The Cure) and Frank Black/Black Francis (The Pixies). Also note Tin Machine's guitarist Reeves Gabrels played some cool songs with Robert Smith (\\"A Sign From God\\" from the soundtrack for South Park creators' film Orgazmo, and the awesome \\"Yesterday's Gone\\") and is currently touring with The Cure, and Bowie even covered The Pixies' song \\"Cactus\\" on one of his last albums I recently noticed while waiting for this one (I know, I need to buy some back catalog as soon as I can!). Overall this feels like one of his most accessible albums to me, like his Achtung Baby if that's possible. Really good mix of sounds and vocal style throughout, I have some favorites but continue to find I'm liking it all. Also, the instrumental song called \\"Plan\\" on the deluxe edition is the intro music to the video for \\"The Stars (Are Out Tonight)\\" if anyone was wondering where that is. \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" sounds so much like Ozzy it's crazy! Can't imagine anyone familiar with Bowie not enjoying this album though. Pick it up duckies.njoying this album though. Pick it up duckies.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't stop reading it  It was every bit as good as the movie.  Thanks for making it available on the Kindle.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really liked this story, but there were a few unanswered questions floating around in my head. What type of work did they do? And other real-life questions. This books title and summary tells you the main plot of the story and delivers just as you expect in the most romantic way. The romantic, emotional side of relationship was the focus of this story. All those thoughts, arguements we have floating around in our head. This story was easy to read yet detailed. I didn't want the story to end, however it was thoroughly complete and I enjoyed it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|As a fellow sci-fi indie author (I wrote [[ASIN:B00AHHVC94 Jesus Was a Time Traveler]]), I initially picked up Howey's \\"Wool: Omnibus\\" as a marketing experiment of sorts--I wanted to see what Hugh had done to garner all of the accolades.<br /><br />I received my answer, and then some!<br /><br />From Wool I all the way through V, I was consistently amazed by how Howey developed the world of the silo in greater and greater detail with each installment. I'm simply amazed that he didn't have this entire arc plotted out from the first story--that's the mark of an absolute master, folks.<br /><br />The question at the root of the book is \\"what will we do to survive?\\", both on an individual level and more of a macro, society-wide level. Howey makes some fantastic statements about power, abuse of that power, the \\"will of the people,\\" and technology.<br /><br />As I continued reading, I found myself increasingly drawn into the universe of the silo, searching for clues, developing and scuttling theories, and finding myself amazed when Howey would finally pull back the curtain and reveal something far more clever than I imagined.<br /><br />I fear that Wool will soon take up valuable space in my brain alongside Star Trek and Star Wars as a constantly-evolving universe of its own, filled with complex characters and plenty of deep (pardon the pun) moral dilemmas.<br /><br />Fantastic work, Hugh--I'm working through [[ASIN:B00B6Z6HI2 Shift Omnibus Edition (Shift 1-3) (Silo Saga)]] now, and loving it, as well. Keep up the good work!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love this movie. The cover looks great and it's a great addition to our movie library.  Kids love it too.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|If you like Bon Jovi, then you will like this CD.  Solid all the way through.  It isn't New Jersey or Slippery When Wet, but it is good.  If you have liked their recent stuff, then you will like this.  If you haven't been a fan of the recent stuff, then you probably won't like this.  They are not breaking new ground.  As a fan since the beginning, I have NO problem with that.  Bring it on!
B002JVWQSW|4.0|it's nice to own such a funny series.  So far it's one of our favorites to watch again and again.

B0015AARJI|5.0|Well, I bought this controlled few months ago and I am using it for both PC and Mac. If you want to use it in PCs then its perfectly fine and handle almost all the games. I also tried to used it on mac book, but some of the games like Assassins Creed does not support controller for Mac Book. So, you must be careful before you purchase it. If your sole purpose is for gaming in Mac then see if the game that you are interested supports controller in Mac. Have fun! Overall this products is great if your game supports it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am not sure why I did not particularly enjoy this book.  The writing is good.  Perhaps because I am not a fan of murder mysteries, if you will. One aspect I did not care for was the vulgar language.  And yet, grotesque verbiage was necessary, I think, for the reader to develop a personal relationship with Amy.  Every reader will, without a doubt, develop a strong opinion of the characters,particularly Amy.  The female reader will appreciate portions of Amy's perspective.  For example, Amy, being as highly intelligent as she is, truly exposes all the modern fallacies of feminine allure.  How being the Cool Girl is altogether a lie.  Amy is the definition of a pure sociopath, and her keen intellect certainly contributes to Amy's demented psyche.  And yet, one cannot help but appreciate her perspective nonetheless.  If only Amy had a sense of morality, she might almost be likable, or at the very least, pitied.<br />Many readers simply loathed the ending, but I actually liked it.  Amy was always one step ahead, and by the end it became apparent she would probably always stay one step ahead.  (Not plausible in my humble opinion, but this is fiction, after all).  Thus, I liked her husband's last remark.  No matter how far she manipulated those around her, Amy would always be herself, and truly pathetic soul.
B00B0U2SEA|4.0|\\"Schindler's List\\" is a difficult movie to watch. I can't say it's something you want to repeatedly view for entertainment because it's so tragic and downright depressing. The last time I watched it was in 1993. If it wasn't for the release of the movie on Blu-ray for its 20th anniversary, I quite possibly would've never seen the film again. All that being said, I'm glad I did. It was a reminder of the unspeakable events that unfolded during World War II and how easily they can happen.<br /><br />Oskar Schindler is an industrial businessman and member of the Nazi Party. He uses his factory as a means of employing Jews and keeping them from being sent to the concentration camps. As he continues his crusade to save as many Jews as he can, he comes dangerously close to having his true intentions discovered by the Nazi officials he must act like he's aligned with.<br /><br />To say \\"Schindler's List\\" is one of the most important films of the 1990s would be an understatement. It's quite possibly one of the most significant ones of the entire 20th century. It captures the best of both worlds when it comes to filmmaking. Director Steven Spielberg used all the modern tools at his disposal and crafted a movie that looks timeless and will never be considered irrelevant in any decade to come.<br /><br />The movie is as graphic as the subject matter demands it to be. The atrocities committed by the Nazis against the Jews need to be seen to pound home the horrific acts they unleashed upon them. Is it a bit too much for some people to see? Of course it is. If you think seeing it onscreen is tough, just think about how it was to live it.<br /><br />My only problem with \\"Schindler's List\\" is its scenes of sexuality. They are a distraction from the real purpose of the movie and give parents a reason to not allow their teenagers to view it. In a nutshell, they limit the amount of people who will be exposed to the movie.<br /><br />I completely understand the nudity when it comes to the Jews having to strip down naked and run around the camp. This shows the sort of humiliation they were put through and helps the audience identify with it. There's absolutely nothing sexy or sensual about that.<br /><br />The 20th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of \\"Schindler's List\\" was painstakingly restored and supervised by Steven Spielberg. The audio and video transfers are absolutely flawless. The picture is black and white with tiny splashes of color here and there throughout. The 5.1 surround sound uses the quiet of hiding and the noisy chaos of the Ghetto and concentration camps to properly put audiences in the middle of the circumstances unfolding on film.<br /><br />The special features for the Blu-ray version of \\"Schindler's List\\" will probably disappoint most consumers. There's a 77-minute documentary entitled \\"Voices from the List\\" in which director Steven Spielberg interviews Holocaust survivors and their descendants. He also shares background on the organization he founded through the 5-minute featurette \\"USC Shoah Foundation Story with Steven Spielberg.\\" A promotional spot for the online application IWitness is also included.<br /><br />\\"Schindler's List\\" will go down in history as one of the most important films ever released in all of human history. Thanks to its cinematography and classic black and white format, it maintains a timeless feel that will serve it well in the decades to come. It is a welcome and essential addition to every home entertainment library.he Jews having to strip down naked and run around the camp.

B003TSEEDY|4.0|This may very well be the first time I've ever said it....the movie was much better. Though there were of course pieces in the book not in the movie and its odd some of those made no difference while others would have been excellent in the movie but oh well. I wasn't expecting the book to be the way it was after having watched the movie first. Both were solid stories and both good stuff. Maybe having Emma as Sam was what made the movie great. I liked in the book how I got to know all the books he was reading. And I loved the song p<br />laylists. And the poem was...wow
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is filled with a unique perspective of the world. In good times and through bad, as readers we can take away ideas to live by and as humans, things to consider about the world around us. Truly remarkable book.

0143119680|4.0|For me, this book had a slow start. I was enjoying the story but felt no rush to get to the end until about halfway through. Once I got to that point, I didn't want to put my Kindle down. That said, I am glad the author took the time to set up the story and flesh out the characters because it made me care about them more than if she had hurried things along.<br /><br />I was thoroughly entertained by this novel and can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is a \\"must-read\\" not only for introverts, but also for teachers, parents, managers, church leaders, spouses, and anyone else who deals with different personality types.  We live in a culture that values extroverts over introverts.  This book makes the case that introverts are every bit as valuable as extroverts.  It examines the latest scientific studies that show that a fair amount of our personalities is genetic.  Being introverted isn't a pathology that needs to be cured with psychotherapy.  Nor does being an introvert mean one is a loner or social outcast.  Many introverts have deep friendships and have been very successful in their careers, including attaining prominent leadership positions.  The author makes the case that many introverts are able to adopt some extrovert attributes when necessary to accomplish work they care deeply about, although it comes at a psychic expense and they will need downtime to recharge.<br /><br />This book gives very practical advice for raising introverted children, teaching introverted students, managing both introverted and extroverted employees, how introvert/extrovert couples can work out their differences, and how an introvert can succeed in a culture that places such a high value on being an extrovert.  It's a mix of scientific theory, cultural history, and practical advice.  It's written in a very personal and down-to-earth style.  The author mixes in her own personal experiences along with the personal experiences of others. She visits bastions of extroverted behavior such as Harvard Business School, a large evangelical church, and an elementary school classroom.  She also explores cultures that place a higher value on introverts.<br /><br />As an introvert myself, I found this book very affirming.

B00138GZAC|5.0|Sade introduced me to a type of music I had not heard of, or was even interested in, when she first came out.  ( I was young, and liked ROCK!!!)<br /><br />  Her blend of a variety of musical styles along with great vocals, opened my &#34;musical world&#34;, and many others I imagine.  Her music made me explore different types of music and opened up my world, so to speak.<br />  Good music will, in most cases cross over and be listened by people who tend to stick to one type of music.  Good music will become hits, many times, and introduce people to new and wonderful genres of music.<br /><br />For an artist to &#34;Cross-over&#34; and introduced to and appreciated to people who tend to limit what they listen to,  is rare, (at least 10-15 or so years ago) and is no easy feat.<br /><br />People like Garth Brooks, brought country into the mainstream, and showed that country music can ROCK and is not just for cowboys and rednecks.  Shania Twain, Gary Moore (guitarist for Thin Lizzy, that became one of the premier blues guitarists...) Eric Clapton, the list goes on.....and Sade is among them...

0765325950|5.0|This is the way the Wheel of Time was meant to end. Sadly Robert Jordan could not live to see the end of his magnum opus, but he is with his readers in spirit and in words. The last chapter, primarily written by Jordan, evoke the early novels in this series as they gently move along no longer burdened by the massive and intricate tale he wove.<br /><br />That intricacy was both the Wheel of Time's greatest achievement and greatest failing. At times the series became heavy, ponderous, burdensome, and may other synonyms, but that was because of the brilliance of the world that was created. This series is not your standard farm boy becomes reluctant hero and defeats clear and recognizable villain after deciding that he has to do his duty. This is an intricate series of fantasy, and politics, and second chances. There are clear heroes and villains, but not all of them are so obvious. There are a huge number of characters all handled with, for the vast majority of the time, aplomb.<br />This final entry into the series is a final thank you to all the fans who stuck with it, in good times and in bad.<br /><br />Sadly another author had to finish this masterpiece, but I think Mr. Jordan would be proud of how it all turned out. This is a fantasy series in the grand fantasy style. It isn't as dark and gritty as some other works, but it is an epic that all fantasy, and non-fantasy, fans should read. If you want to know exactly why you will have to read and find out.
B006LS7DQE|3.0|I've played this on psp/vita and it was great but just like other users have complained, this port needs work. Fix it and I'll consider 5 stars but for now, with all the hard to deal with animations and shuddering, they should be happy with 3
B005FFW46S|5.0|Even at his worst Terry Pratchett is better than almost all currently active authors combines and this is not Terry Pratchett at his worst. Personally, there are Diskworld novels I enjoy more, but this is a wonderful, smart, funny, crafty novel worthy of a read, or two, or ten.
0393343405|3.0|The Serve is written by a Harvard literature professor who posits the idea that the discovery of the lost poem of Lucretius \\"On the Nature of Things\\" by Poggio Bracciolini in 1417 was the seminal event in bringing about the Renaissance. Believe that and I have a a bridge I want to sell you!  Just ask yourself if the poem had not been discovered would the Renaissance have come about and you will see how silly the idea is.<br /><br />At the same time the book does have redeeming values that make it worth reading, at least for some.  First of all it chronicles the events of the times which were quite interesting. There were three claimants to the title of pope and Poggio was the personal secretary to the one at Rome whose title was John XXIII (not to be confused with the modern John XXIII since the one in the book was eventually defrocked and the title became usable again).  To solve this crisis a meeting was organized in a city in Souther Germany to which Poggio and his pope went. But it apparently became clear to the pope that he would lose out and he departed and finally was deposed.<br /><br />The other interesting theme in the book is the philosophy of Epicurism.  The author details the main points of this philosophy as presented in the poem which is quite long and difficult for moderns to read. Religious people might not find this section to be very interesting as the poem is a staunch argument for atheism.  But as someone who is agnostic toward religions I found this information to be very thought-provoking.<br /><br />I rate the book as three stars but it could be two (based on the premise) or four (based on the historical information provided. The relatively low rating should not dissuade people from reading the book which will stimulate your thinking.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool Omnibus was a fantastic (set of) book(s). It was positively fascinating to see a world so different from our own that exists in our possible future. I genuinely enjoyed every minute of it and had a hard time putting it down so I could go to sleep at night. Read this series! You won't regret it!
B009VA1FN6|2.0|Started off well but I totally lost interest halfway through and deleted it from my Kindle. The book did not flow because of the shifts in time.
0345803485|4.0|Very late adding this review here, but felt this was definitely a must for this blog. I have very mixed emotions about this book and had to do a lot of re-thinking before I re-wrote this interview to really sort out what I feel about this book.<br /><br /> I am a part of a group on Goodreads that E.L. James was actually a part of herself before her novel went viral, and from my understanding, this book began as a blog, a parody of some sort about the hit saga Twilight. I caught the comparisons and humor between the characters right away. This was a brilliant concoction of the ingredients that make life and fiction work together.  BDSM, is a very real thing that we don't particularly hear of on a daily basis, unless you are one of which ties people up for punishment and love to kiss and tell... My impression of this book was that of a girl who falls foolishly in love with a very rich and controlling man whom she has no earthly idea what she's getting herself into before these feelings evolve.<br />Bella (Twilight's foolish girl): Falls in love with a  devastatingly, beautiful, rich guy at school but has no earthly idea that he's indeed a  controlling, dangerous, vaaaaampire. (OOooo)<br /><br />Ana(50 Shades foolish girl): Falls in love with a  devastatingly, beautiful, rich guy but has no earthly idea that he's indeed a controlling, dangerous...Sex Maniac. (OOooo)<br />Then you have the plot where they break up because he's just too dangerous to be around (Edward/Christian) and the girl can't make up her mind how she feels being a part of that life(style). And the love triangles such as Jacob/Jose and the  flight back home to see her parents to prove to the girl that the man does care,  etc. etc. the list goes on.<br /><br /> I know there were mandatory changes made to the story in order for it to be published by the company that picked Ms. James up because of the too similar story plot and characters, but there are a lot of people who want to sit there behind their screens and trash talk this book, sticking their literary noses up in the air as if they were too good to read this. Considering the pre-circumenstances, this book really was not written horribly. I think the problem is they just can't humor the pretenses of this book. Took me a while to figure out my feelings for it, but I've decided that this book had me so curious after so many friends talked me into it, and once I began, I just couldn't put it down for the life of me. There were times I snuck a read at work and my jaw would hit the floor and I'd be like \\"She did NOT just do that...\\" \\"Omg he did that?\\" \\"OW\\"  \\"EW\\" \\"OMG NO! Get that thing out of there!\\" \\"Don't stick that up ther...oh crap... he did it...\\"<br /><br />Let me tell ya, it has been so many years since a book had ever gotten that much of a reaction out of me.  Before this novel, I was a BSDM-Romance-Novel-Virgin... so that could be part of the reasoning behind my stunned mind. But all in all, what makes an author so brilliant, is being able to produce a story that rises a reaction from its reader. Whether the reactions are physical, positive, or causes arguments. I am starting to believe that the people who gave this book such a bad rep for its grammar usage, or what ever else they dug deep to find, were just looking for an excuse NOT to like this book because it became so mainstream and a big hit. I am often one of those people who refuse to join in on any type of fad, but I am also one of which has a curious mind, that if left unattended,  eventually goes stir-crazy. Me reading this book was the type of curiosity that could be compared to your sisters well hidden diary. I shouldn't read it, but the gossip just sounds waaaay too appealing. I read it. I was disgusted, I laughed. My eye brows went so far up as my eyes widened, they just about flung right off my forehead at times. I was distubed many, many times... But what good is a book that doesnt stirr up some sort of feeling as you read? I have finally decided my answer. Yes. I did enjoy this book. And I think people should loosen up a little. Reading is a hobby, have fun with it. (No offense)y decided my answer. Yes. I did enjoy this book. And I think people should loosen up a little. Reading is a hobby, have fun with it. (No offense)

0307279189|5.0|\\"A hidden tribe, superathletes, and the greatest race the world has never seen\\"<br /><br />Thought provoking - Entertaining - Motivating - A must read for runners and non-runners alike!<br /><br />Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. It has been a while since I have sacrificed night time TV watching for a book, but this one became an addiction. I devoured it in two days and was raving about it non-stop afterwards.<br /><br />I must admit that after reading the first few chapters I was questioning whether this was a fictional book. I am not that familiar with the ins and outs and personalities within US running circles. This coupled with high tales of the Tarahumaran Indians and a reclusive gringo gone grunge in the deadly Copper Canyons going by the name of Caballo Blanco just threw me for a six. As I eased into the story however I realized that what the author Christopher McDougall was doing was representing every character and their story. If something didn't make sense, it wasn't meant to as there more was to come and loose ends would be tied when they needed to be. He did an outstanding job of not only weaving a magnificent tale but also intertwining tidbits and findings about running science, history and anthropology.<br /><br />For the reader each character comes alive and you empathize and sympathize with them during their part of the journey. You also begin to question everything that you think you know about running that has been fed to you by the big brand names. Do I need stabilizing shoes to minimize injury or does the shoe in fact cause the injuries? Will running over twenty miles kill my joints or will it set me free?<br /><br />This book has also been the catalyst for a miracle... my husband has started to run and has been enjoying it.

B001P9KR8U|3.0|Movie<br />Slumdog Millionaire<br />Review<br /><br />By Richard E. Noble<br /><br />This movie is touted as \\"the feel good movie of the year.\\" Anybody who watched this movie and left feeling good about it, in my opinion, is lacking in something vital to their social conscience.<br /><br />I don't know what the creators' intentions were with this film but I will certainly not be planning my next getaway vacation to India.<br /><br />After watching this movie, I am left feeling much as I did after watching the movie, \\"Midnight Express.\\" I was happy for the man's release from the Turkish prison in Midnight Express, just as I am happy for the two slumdogs who are the protagonists in this movie.<br /><br />I definitely think this movie warrants praise and it deserves any awards that have been accorded to it but it certainly didn't make me feel good. It made me feel very, very bad.<br /><br />A slumdog appears to be India's modern day equivalent to what was once referred to in that culture as \\"Untouchables.\\" The word \\"slumdog\\" is, of course, meant to be derogatory. An English equivalent might be dirtbag or scumbag.<br /><br />India once suffered under what was called a caste system and it appears from this movie that they still do.<br /><br />Supposedly this caste system belief is a part of the Hindu religion and its notion of reincarnation and Karma. It is a system of social stratification and a person's karma,<br />his behavior in his previous lives, determines his position in his present life.<br /><br />The karma of certain people is so bad that they are placed in a caste not included in even the lowest caste of the caste system.<br /><br />They are the Untouchables or the Dolits.<br /><br />I remember reading about the horrid lives of these poor Untouchables decades ago.<br />I thought Dickens' \\"Oliver Twist\\" was a horror story until I began reading about the real lives of the Untouchables in the non-fiction Indian culture.<br /><br />These people lived in garbage dumps and scavenged and begged for their survival. The parents in these families would cripple, maim and blind their children so as to make them better beggars and increase their beggary dividends.<br /><br />If I can believe this movie, it does not appear that much has changed in the Indian culture of today. I think it was George Orwell who stated, in his trekking India travelogue, that India would never become a great country because of its Hindu beliefs and the Hindu acceptance of fate and destiny and consequently poverty and social injustice and inequality. Considering the impressions left by this movie, I think he makes a good point.<br /><br />This movie undermines all that I have been reading lately about the new India and the social progress it has been making over the past few decades.<br /><br />That there are people living in India today who are boasting that they will soon be the leading economic culture in the world boggles my imagination. Much worse than that is the notion that if this actually were to be the case, the picture of the future that this film paints for the world is bleak indeed.<br /><br />On the surface this is a love story. But unfortunately the moral, only revealed at the conclusion of the movie is one from that old time religion based on the Hindu notion of karma, destiny and fate.<br /><br />So it seems that the Hindu caste system and the faith that spawned it are still alive and well in modern day India - at least according to this movie.<br /><br />The male hero's mother is murdered as she washes her clothes in some filthy pool of water. Her murder is not explained other than it had something to do with rivaling religious fanatics.<br /><br />The two sons are now orphaned slumdogs. They are captured by a Faganesque, drug dealing gangster. He tortures, maims and brutalizes his captives to keep them in line and enhance their beggary. The two brothers and the younger brother's little girlfriend attempt an escape before the younger boyis blinded by his tortures.<br /><br />The boys escape but the little girl does not catch the train and remains with the drug dealing gangster and his gang of cutthroats. The remainder of this tale centers on this couple's reunification.<br /><br />Somehow mixed in here in this slum ridden, horror show of a country, a modern day TV program is incorporated into the film. As hard as it is to believe, the younger brother has matured and is a contestant on the TV show, an Indian version of \\"Who wants to be a millionaire.\\"<br /><br />The show ends in a Michael Jackson type dance celebration and production extravaganza.<br /><br />As I said in the beginning of this review, I do not know the real intentions of the creators of this film but they left a huge impression on me.<br /><br />Unfortunately that impression is extremely negative.<br /><br />At one point in the movie, one of the characters says to somebody,<br />\\"Well, you wanted to see a true picture of the real India, didn't you?\\"<br /><br />My god! Thank-you very much but I've seen enough of the \\"real\\" India to last me a good while.<br /><br />The Hobo Philosopher is a writer and the author of \\"Hooked on Books\\" among others.is blinded by his tortures.<br /><br />The boys escape but the little girl does not catch the train and remains with the drug dealing gangster and his gang of cutthroats.

1455869872|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is written by John Green and was published only a year ago. This book is about a sixteen year old girl, Hazel Lancaster, who has had stage four thyroid cancer since age thirteen. All she really wants to do is be a regular teenager but she knows she can never be. She has to use an oxygen tank at all times to be able to breathe properly. She is forced by her mom to go to Support Group at the local church where many other kids also attend that have cancer. While there, she meets Augustus Waters, a former basketball star who lost his right leg to Osteosarcoma, and is in remission. Hazel and Augustus spend more and more time together and she convinces him to read her favorite book, \\"An Imperial Affliction.\\" He almost loves the book as much as she does. When their relationship deepens even more, complications with Hazel's cancer get worse and they start to feel they're drifting apart. Luckily, Augustus saved his wish from \\"The Genies\\" (a fictionalized version of The Make A Wish Foundation), and used the wish to take Hazel and himself to Amsterdam to meet the author of \\"An Imperial Affliction\\", Peter Van Houten. The trip gets postponed when Hazel gets a serious case of pneumonia. She goes through a quick recovery and then they are on their way to Amsterdam! Once they get there, they are treated to a beautiful meal, courtesy of Van Houten. But, they soon find out that Van Houten is rude and an alcoholic. He wont answer any of their questions and is very disrespectful towards them.  They realize people are not all they seem to be. They spend one more day in Amsterdam and head home. When they get back, Augustus reveals his cancer has returned. From that point on, he starts heading in a downward spiral. Hazel and Augustus know what it's like to have cancer but all they can do now is just be there for each other.<br />  I think this book is absolutely amazing. It's a true love story of two teenagers that have been through more in their life than most people could ever imagine. I just can't comprehend what it would be like to go three years with cancer and try to be a normal teenager and actually succeed at it. Teenagers already have enough stress with high school, responsibilities, drama, and just trying to be the best you can be. When you add cancer to that mix, you would think one would just simply break down. But Hazel stays strong and that's what I like about her. This book is beautifully written and is for all you readers out there that like to laugh and cry at the same time!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I belong to a women's group that has online chapters.  We read a book every three months.  The Kitchen House was our selection this time.  I will be honest that I had a hard time getting into it at first, but soon as I read more often, the characters came to life.  I couldn't put it down.  For example.... I felt so much of what the characters had to put up especially  Beattie & her relationship with  Marshall.  She didn't like being his whore, but there was little she could do as he was the Masta.  I am really glad he got what was coming to him as he was  sch an evil man. I wished that Livinia and Will could have married, but then I am such a romantic.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I haven't reached the top level games yet, but most of these games are extremely simple, somewhat entertaining, time fillers.  A few have the same basic idea but it is presented differently.  If you want a large selection of absolutely mindless games, which require little to no skill, I would recommend this app.  It's good that there are many games in it because I tend to get bored with one after 1 or 2 tries, but if you switch around it's not so bad.

He's like the Energizer Bunny.  He hits the stage and it's &#34;petal to the metal&#34; the entire time he's up there. I couldn't believe what a fabulous performer he actually was in person.

B00APKIN1I|2.0|Honestly I'm a little lost as to why Dave Grohl would go to all the trouble of making a movie about how great music was when it was recorded live (and by real people) with analogue equipment, and then turn around and have the sound track mastered the way it is. It's over compressed and has no dynamic range at all.<br /><br />Some of the songs are decent, but I was completely misled. It could have been much more.

Listening to the cd it really reminds me of Bad Company and Bowes is without a doubt a true vocalist. This guy can sing his ass off......Im not sure of the other releases I read where they were produced to  be more in the mainstream of what else was happening at the time and that would be a shame, because they show on this cd that they can definetly do it all..<br /><br />  In short Thunder's Backstreet Symphony is absolutely a piece of music that you would want and need to hear.
B005LAIII0|4.0|I was assigned to read Yann Martel's LIFE OF PI in a college freshman lit class over Thanksgiving break.  I had the misfortune to fall sick that Monday, and was bedridden until Friday.  Martel's novel kept me company; in between bouts of passing out, I'd read about the epic journey of young Pi--a journey both physical and spiritual.  I loved the novel; after six years of college literary courses, it remains the only book I've been assigned that I subsequently went out and purchased, and reread, before the course was over.<br /><br />I never expected, or wanted, to see a film version.  Like many great books, PI is rooted in its literary origins.  And as such, the film version does suffer slightly--what comes off as exciting and insightful in the novel can seem somewhat boring and lackluster (at least, plot-wise) onscreen.  This is only to be expected.  And yet, David Magee's script sticks faithfully with the novel, right down to much of the dialogue.  In the form of our tortured hero--I use the word lightly; \\"protagonist\\" would be a better term--we have Suraj Sharma, giving a solid performance (the fantastic Irrfan Khan plays the older Pi, with Rafe Spall playing the Writer).  The problem with the film, aside from the slow pace (which isn't nearly so slow in book form) is that Sharma is out-acted by everything around him; that's only to be expected when you have a film that looks so absolutely beautiful.  WIth vibrant colors, rich textures, and just an overal REALNESS to the cinematography, PI blew me away (and I only watched the 2D version).<br /><br />But the true star here is Richard Parker, Pi's carnivorous raft-mate.  Perhaps the pinnacle of modern CGI (an actual tiger was used for some shots, but mostly it's the computers), Richard Parker comes truly to life under Ang Lee and company's masterful hands.  The fact that a fake tiger is the focal point of LIFE OF PI isn't an accident; it's a beautiful film with a dangerous edge, easily mistaken as a life-affirming, optimistic piece.  Truthfully, the film follows the novel's spirit as well as plot: you take from it what you bring to it.  Maybe its ambiguity in such matters can be counted against it; if the movie (and novel) had taken a true stand, there might be more to admire.  Still, LIFE OF PI--whichever form you approach it in, though I highly recommend the novel, even if Martel's other works fall short--is a story to make you think.  Maybe you'll walk away happy, maybe you'll walk away depressed, maybe you'll just be frustrated and confused; the point is, you'll walk away feeling SOMETHING.  And if that's not the point of art, then I'm not sure what is.optimistic piece.  Truthfully, the film follows the novel's spirit as well as plot: you take from it what you bring to it.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|This book was not what I expected.  I expected a book by a neurosurgeon to be scientifically based.  This was not.  It is just one more person's subjective experience that cannot be tested in anyway.  For that reason, it did not deliver what the title claims it will.  However, I was interested in the story of his life, his illness and the way it affected his family.  This back story almost, but not quite, redeemed it.  But don't pick this book up if you are expecting proof that there is a heaven - because this book does not prove anything.

B005LAIIHG|4.0|As is obvious from the number of rave reviews this film LIFE OF PI was are sounding success in the theaters when it was shown in 3D. There is no question but that the story, so well known over the past decades since the publication of the book of the same name by Yann Martel, draws everybody in, whether because of the indomitable spirit of our surviving hero or the religious aspects of the story.  Perhaps because of all the hoopla about director Ang Lee's manipulation of CGI effects and the endless interviews about the making of the film that make the final product (on DVD at least) seem so contrived and unreal that some viewers will find the end product less than satisfying a version of the novel. David Magee sculpted the screenplay from the novel and while that provides a lot of background about the character of Pi before the main event of the lost at see episode, it does seem disruptive at times and in this viewer's response robs the story form some of the poetry.<br /><br />The story has been summarized elsewhere as follows: `In Canada, a writer visits the Indian storyteller Pi Patel and asks him to tell a story. Pi tells the story of his life since he was a kid in Pondicherry, India and the origin of his nickname. One day, his father who owns a zoo tells his family that his business is not good and he had decided to move to Canada and sell part of the animals in the United States. They travel in a Japanese cargo ship with the animals and out of the blue, there is a storm followed by a shipwrecking. Pi survives in a lifeboat with a zebra, a orangutan, a hyena and a male Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. They are adrift in the Pacific Ocean and when the tiger is hungry, he eats the other animals. Soon Pi learns that he might find a way to feed and domesticate the tiger to survive.<br /><br />The character of Pi Patel is played for the most part by Suraj Sharma while his earlier years embodiments are shared by Ayush Tandon and Gautam Belur and the adult storyteller by Irrfan Khan. Pi's parents are played by Adil Hussain  and Gita Patel and his brother Ravi by, depending on age, Ayan Khan, Mohd Abbas Khaleeli, and Vibish Sivakumar,  Rafe Spall is the writer who will create the book from Pi's story, and for a few brief moments G&eacute;rard Depardieu plays a Cook on the ship.<br /><br />There are some very beautiful scenes of skies and waterscapes, but we are left wondering how much of this is carton created in the large studio tank that serves as the ocean. Some of Martell's original explanation of the various religions Pi adheres to are retained: they were the best part of the novel. Perhaps in 3D this film would have worked better.

0307352145|5.0|People Managers who are extroverts won't like this book but they need to read it. Not everyone in your organization is like YOU - some people don't like committees, team-building exercises, open-space floor designs, etc.  They may tell you they do but they honestly don't.  And you need to recognize that.  It doesn't mean introverts are not \\"team players\\" or grumpy old men or hermits or anti-social beings - it just means we work differently than you do.  Different, yes, but not any less efficient or productive.  An employee shouldn't be forced to fit into an extrovert mold just because that's what the boss wants.  Doing so only does an inservice to the employee and the company!<br /><br />This book has been eye-opening and validating at the same time and I'm not even 1/2 way through yet.  Read it, understand it, and don't discount it just because it may run counter to what you think you want to accomplish as a manager.

However, if you're deciding between these and a branded version that's a bit more, I'd definitely recommend these.

Way too many loose ends and I felt like the ending was a bit rushed and anti-climactic.  Lauren Oliver is a beautiful writer and I found myself really wrapped up in the story and the characters.  I feel like when I put down the book there was not enough resolution.  I don't need everything to tie together perfectly, but really, we are left to guess what happens with most of the characters.  Oh well, it was still a worthwhile series.  I give this book 4 stars because it started out very good and the series overall was great.  Maybe if enough of us complain she will write a fourth book.

If not for the slow start, I would have given the book 5 stars. Once you get to a certain point, it becomes a real page turner.  Worth the time to read.

B006FO3ERQ|4.0|A dismal life story  told from the perspective of a 15 year old.  What wonderful writing.  Short but extremely descriptive and emotive sentances.  The story grabs you and you want to find out what happens to this perceptive, sad, but future-oriented kid; a product of both parents. The family rings true and has elements I could identify with--the scheming, optimistic failure of a father, the intellectual, misplaced mother.  How did they get to that place without thinking of consequences?  The kids who become the victims of the ultimate scheme through no fault of their own.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love this book. The explanation and his experience of the other side (known as heaven) gives me goose bumps. I've had the opportunity to experience the other side, and Eben Alexander does an excellent job in describing it. So glad this book is available and so popular.

0143034901|2.0|The Shadow of the Wind begins very promisingly with the protagonist being a young 9 year old boy when the story begins. It trails his life so far, his love for reading and one particular author who he randomly chanced upon, it then goes on about his quest.<br /><br />I found the author tiresome at times. He seems to introduce a new character into the book in every chapter. The chapters are moodily long and sometimes short but never is there a promising continuation and beginning of most chapters is without any flair or intelligence..Who writes so bad? The author drones on about certain new characters for the longest without ever making me feel that the character added any value to the plot whatsoever. I found his writing child lackluster cause it lacked true intelligence but it seemed based on a whim. I can agree this was a despairing time for people because of the civil war but the author doesn't manage to seep in enough remorse in me to care.<br /><br />The first half of the book is better than the last and I found the read very arduous because there are SO MANY CHARACTERS and frankly at times I wanted to fling a STONE at Daniel's head and ask him to mind his own business instead of rotting other people's life to feed his toddler's curiosity.<br /><br />I don't recommend this book to people because there are many better, more engaging books out there which are written without any childish whim to speak in guttural fairy tale flourish.<br /><br />I found it so annoying that the more I talk about it, the more I want to take away from it. Yes, there are a few quotes in this book worth quoting but there are hardly any characters in the book I found \\"not pretentious\\" and \\"yielding\\" except this one character of a blind girl, Clara.<br /><br />I am that reader who likes every book he reads but every once in a long time, I come across a speed breaker. This is that headache. Go read a Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Salman Rushdie or even Jonathan Safran Foer story.
B0047Y0FGY|1.0|I am a big fan of Tina Fey and thought this book would be a fun read.  I the book was all over the place and very boring.  I kept flipping pages hoping it would get better in the next chapter, but it did not.  I'm about a 1/4 though the book and just can not read anymore.  Would not waste your money on this purchase.  Really had higher expectations as she is a wonderful writter for TV, I guess it did not carry over to books.

B0007ODLCS|4.0|I have this box set as I collect most of Townes' recordings. It is excellent value, but like some other reviewers have noted, this is not necessarily the best means to approach his music as his studio albums were, by and large, fairly ordinary.<br />This box set also lacks the full compliment of tracks from his 'Live at the Old Quarter' set. I suggest buy that record, available on Amazon fairly cheap. That's Townes at his ragged best and features a rough Pancho & Lefty that may be his best.<br />Another live set worth a listen is the (underrated) early-career recording \\"An Gentle Evening With Townes Van Zandt\\". This features his best Tecumseh Valley, better singing than later recordings and some awkward reactions from the conservative crowd following \\"talking KKK blues\\".<br /><br />Whatever you choose, he's one of the great americana songwriters.
B0035KGWR2|5.0|A lot of great songs on this album. 1. Next Big Thing 2. Love Love 3. Don't Tell Me That it is Over. 4. Spark. 5.An ordinary Life 6. Give it all up 7. My only one. *. This pretty Face. Just about every song sounds like a hit.

0765325950|5.0|Just finished the book last night and I LOVED IT.<br /><br />We finally reach the last battle, and that's what this book is all about. If you've read the first 13 books, obviously you'll read this one (how could you nooot?) - and you won't be disappointed! All the major story lines reach their conclusion, the ending left me feeling satisfied (no ridiculous all lived happily ever after, no soul crushing and they all die.... the ending is good).<br /><br />I can't understand how some people give this book only 1 star. I was enthralled by the story line - yes, even the 700 pages of battle manouvering. There are some great surprises, story lines that come back from past books are tied in.... it's not perfect, but I don't think it could have been any better.<br /><br />Secretly I am hoping for a book 15... after the battle is finished, I'd love to hear how the 4th age goes.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I downloaded this app for my 4-year-old daughter, and she had fun playing with it, but the next day I found out, (the hard way), that she had apparently bought virtual game tokens or something using the very REAL money in my checking account.  Are they nuts?!  There are apparently no safeguards against that sort of thing in this game and no options I can find to change it.  I had to just delete the game, much to my daughter's disappointment.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This film is a complex and complicated story.<br /><br />The first thing to say is that the acting is good, very good, contrasting the tense situation, nerve-breaking actually, and the very calm behavior of most of the six hostages and the placid looking behavior of the CIA agent. Not to speak of the tremendous mental tension of most of Iranian people at the airport and the extreme excitation of some in the bazaar and most of the revolutionary guards. That is well done and very effective for us to believe we are in a real situation and not in some James Bond film.<br /><br />Then the story itself is a very sorry episode of Iranian history, when the Islamic revolution succeeded against the corrupted regime of the Shah who had taken over after the ousting of Mossadegh who had nationalized Iranian oil. The film forgets to insist on the fact the CIA had heavily helped in the coup d'&eacute;tat that ousted the elected Prime Minister. That would have shown how there was a time before 1975 and another after 1975. Before 1975 the US played the cop of the world and after the defeat in Vietnam they became more humble, though not that long. Reagan brought the pride out again. That's what is more or less forgotten in the film that pretends to speak of real events.<br /><br />The film though is quite good at showing the enormous change that started after 1975. In twenty years the world was to be completely transformed. The defeat in Vietnam caused the emergence of strong movements negating imperialism. Iran was one of these though it was hijacked by the hyper fundamentalist clerics of Iranian Islam who imposed a violent revolution with all kinds of coercion against the people who resisted the strict application of Islamic laws, and of course against Americans.<br /><br />The strangest evolution was still to come yet since all those who stuck to a non-market economy were to fall down the historical chute, the flushing chute. The Soviet Union and all their Eastern European block were the first victims and they just fell into the free market economy with a great splash in the world's attentive tension. China felt the trend and changed their policy at the end of the 1970s and we know what happened next. The world was to be completely restructured and economic power was to be completely reshuffled and redistributed.<br /><br />That's in these transitory years of 1979 to 1981 that the hostage crisis in Iran took place. The US embassy was taken over by the revolutionaries and the American personnel was taken hostage, but six had escaped and found refuge at the Canadian Ambassador's residence. The film concerns these six who were in great danger. They were retrieved by a CIA agent sent there as a film producer with the complicity and help of some Hollywood people. That's another change taking place in the USA this time: Americans were ready to serve, even if it was not exactly very good for their public images. Hollywood was on the patriotic side after having been widely against the Vietnam war.<br /><br />That's what I like in this period and in this film. You feel the world is tilting in a different direction though the film does not explain which one since the past is not examined and the future is not even hinted at. But we feel more than perfectly that in-between spirit and atmosphere. The Americans are on the run but they are no longer defeated. They are pulling back in order to revamp their forces. But fear is their basic emotion and that too is a good thing about this period. Fear had changed sides and the USA have had to reconquer their stamina and to try to start getting rid of their arrogance and absolute certainty to be right above all others.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUe first victims and they just fell into the free market economy with a great splash in the world's attentive tension.

0062014536|3.0|** SPOILERS OBVIOUSLY **<br /><br />I like stories that have an open ending.  I like when the author doesn't tie everything up in a little bow but still leaves the characters and the story firmly on a particular path so you can draw your own assumptions.  Not everything has to be spelled out.  Not every story has to take the tale all the way to the happily ever after.  That being said, this book did not have one of those endings.  I'd say this book had no ending at all -- the story just stopped, and then out of nowhere we get an epilogue about walls.  If Ms. Oliver was going for an open ending, I'd say she did not succeed.  The end was not written that way.  It was written as though she had a real ending in mind, but her editor told her the book was too long and she had to condense it; or she was an hour from deadline and didn't finish the story yet, so she had to rush to get the book finished to get to the publishing house for review.  I don't mind that we don't know everything that happened to everyone -- I don't mind that we don't see Lena and *spoiler* start their official happily ever after; I don't mind that we don't see how Lena breaks it to *spoiler* that she is choosing the other guy; I don't mind that we don't see what happened with the revolution (they never implied that the entire war hinged on the battle in Portland, so we wouldn't get a resolution there anyway regardless of what happened in this battle).  But you have to lead the characters to the conclusions if you're not going to spell it out!  You have to have some kind of ending even if you don't fill in all the blanks.  There has to be some kind of closure to know that, even if we don't see it for ourselves, A, B and C will happen.  This story had no closure at all.  And I was very disappointed at that.<br /><br />The rest of the book is engaging.  I liked having the perspective of Hana -- we get to learn exactly how it is to be cured.  Lena's continued adventures with the Resistance, and the turmoil of the love triangle -- which wasn't as annoyingly triangle-y as most stories -- provided some good drama.  The awesomeness of some of these scenes balances out the zero star rating I would give for the ending alone.  I'm not disappointed that I bought the book, but I've got to say that it was not a worthy ending to an otherwise fine dystopian series.oil of the love triangle -- which wasn't as annoyingly triangle-y as most stories -- provided some good drama.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series and all the rest are just brilliant, here is something you can sit back and relax to, and let the show take you back in time. With today's reality shows there is little connection for most of us, and that is one of the reasons why I have stopped watching current TV broadcasts, I'll watch some sports but that is about it, you can keep the rest of it. That's where this show and the whole series brings back some sense to viewing. We are collecting the whole series, as soon as this one is finished we'll be looking to purchase Season 3.

They have killed the yellow eyed demon and are now trying to save Dean from going to hell because he made a deal with a demon to save Sam. As we have learned from this series that this family keeps makking deals with demons and pay the price. It cost them there father life. Season was very good. They hunt down demons and other stuff. Gets slow in the middle but the ending is very well done! A jaw dropping ending that will leave you speechless. They also have that actress who plays Maggie from the Walking Dead in it when she was younger. She was ok.
B009VMN3RA|4.0|As with all biographies, Sachi Parker gives us insight into her inner being. The only drawback is it seems to be a giant apology. When someone keeps saying I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry all the time it can be quite wearing. You still would like to be her friend. To help her carry her burden of self.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The second part takes place after the first one with Spartucus and his group of slaves and fighters on the run from the Romans. People who were not killed in the first are back and the story is not bad. Mostly a lot of action and the plot twists are done well. Ending was not all that. It endedthe same way as the first one. Still a lot of Cgi action and a lot of sex and violence. Not crazyabout CGI but you get use to it and some of it is done well. Some just look too fake.The main guy died in real life and the person who replaced him dida good job. Not really a big difference. Just another good looking white guy in a action series.

Talks about the struggles and triumphs of a man and his dog,... very touching, real, funny, sad and honest. It's a really easy read (some chapters are only 3 pages long), and has a very satisfying and happy ending. It definitely made me from a cat lover to a dog lover.

Jamie Oliver talks about growing his own garden... really getting his hands dirty and understanding the different seasons of fruit and vegetation. He not only gives recipes per season (what's fresh and available each season), but also gives gardening tips and advice to help you with your own organic garden. My husband and I have red thumbs (and kill every plant we grow), but it's really nice to see a holistic view of eating, growing, nurturing and sharing.<br /><br />Plus, his book is well-designed, simple and clean, but beautiful (especially the food photography, which is in color). My husband and I can't wait to go through his book and cook through the seasons with our fresh, farmer's market-bought food!
B00899E5B4|5.0|First I have to admit that while I've owned a few Walsh albums from way back, I never considered myself a huge fan. I enjoyed the humor in his songs, and the care he puts into phrasing, but I never really followed him, even after he joined the Eagles. After seeing him on \\"Live at Daryls House\\" I was impressed with his playing, as usual, but also with his maturity and point of view, particularly on the music industry. So I bought this CD, and to my surprise, it's stayed atop my playlist for weeks.<br /><br />The things that strike me are the composition (some very unexpected but very cool changes,) production, and his voice. I had no idea he could pull off singing as well as he does here. There's great variety, too.<br />While \\"Family\\" is powerfully moving and sincere in its simplicity, \\"One Day at a Time\\" sounds like as fun and catchy as audition for the Wilbury's.<br /><br />Turns out, grown up Joe Walsh is just as much fun as crazy Joe Walsh, but more authentic, even enlightening. He has stories to tell and tells them well. I really appreciate the care that obviously went into this release.

B00B4VXQC8|3.0|What about now? What about Desmond Child?<br /><br />Although I am a fan of Bon Jovi, I can still claim that, to me, their best days were in the eighties when Desmond Child, the prolific and legendary songwriter, was almost a part of the band. \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\", \\"Living On A Prayer\\", \\"Bad Medecine\\", \\"Born To Be My Baby\\" became rock anthems and \\"I'd Die For You\\", \\"Without Love\\" and \\"Wild Is The Wind\\" became some of the fan's favorite gems.  All to the credit of Desmond Child. But then, for some obscure reasons, the band decided to let go of their hit maker and went with a different sound. Desmond Child always remained part of the band, with songs here and there, but the quality was never the same. Certainly not because he wasn't able to write hits anymore (he still does it with other bands to this day) but, I suppose, because Bon Jovi told him not to. From the nineties up to now, my critic of any Bon Jovi album has always been the same. Here it is again for \\"What About Now?\\".<br /><br />Everybody who knows about Bon Jovi knows that the band always composes about thirty to forty songs (I exaggerate a bit...) for each album. They then chose about a dozen for a particular CD. Out of those dozens, there are always at least five or six songs that are pure gems. And out of those five or six songs, there are for sure three songs that can be put directly into a greatest hits album. Before, in the eighties, they would do the same thing but you could also add three to four hits by Desmond Child. They would then need to only choose about six songs out of the bunch they had composed for a particular CD.  Since the nineties, for each CD they make, they choose not six songs but a dozen... without any hits by Desmond Child.  Their CDs are, of course, pretty good but they lack genuine big hits. Rock anthems (with the exception of \\"It's My Life\\").  Since \\"These Days\\" (1995), every CD contains one or two songs only by Desmond Child and they do not compare from the songs madein the eighties (\\"Something For The Pain\\", \\"This Ain't A Love Song\\", \\"Real Life\\", \\"One Wild Night\\", \\"The Distance\\", \\"All About Loving You\\", \\"Bells Of Freedom\\", \\"(You Want To) Make A Memory\\", \\"Broken Promiseland\\" and... now... \\"Army Of One\\"?). I mean...  What the heck is Jon Bon Jovi saying to Desmond Child?<br /><br />With \\"What About Now?\\", Bon Jovi still have their top five songs in there. \\"Because We Can\\", \\"I'm With You\\", \\"What About Now?\\", \\"That's What The Water Made Me\\" and \\"What's Left Of Me\\" are real gems. But take away at least four other songs out of the other seven or nine and replace them with four genuine big rock anthems by Desmond Child (not \\"Army Of One\\", what the hell?)... and you've got yourself one memorable CD.  But without those four big hits, you are left with the same kind of CD Bon Jovi has made since \\"These Days\\"... which is good but not great.<br /><br />And I know that Jon still likes the stuff Desmond Child wrote in the eighties. He copied it with \\"It's My Life\\" and \\"This Is Love, This Is Life\\". Why not go directly at the source (Desmond Child) and write another \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" or \\"Living On A Prayer\\"? With a touch of modernity? Wouldn't it make this last CD sound even more cool? And it wouldn't necessarily be a \\"copy-paste\\" of past hits. It would just be Bon Jovi being Bon Jovi and not forget what made them unique in the first place. To this day, every song Desmond Child wrote in the eighties is what makes the crowd go crazy in all the shows Bon Jovi gives.<br /><br />But what the heck. I still love the band. I still buy the CDs. I still sing the new songs. I still do my compilations. And I will definitely sing the five songs I've mentioned before from this last CD. One thing I liked was that with the song \\"What About Now?\\", they kind of made a wink at another old song they had made but that never made it on any particular album. That song was called \\"Cadillac Man\\" and it was never even used in the movie of the same name. It'sone of my favorite demo from them.  I could never comprehend why they never put it on the box set of demos they made a couple of years ago. Anyhow, at least, they kind of acknowledged it with the song \\"What About Now?\\", even if it's on a subconscious level.<br /><br />So there you have it. Old fans won't be disappointed. New fans either. But if you weren't a fan before, you won't be now. It's what Bon Jovi does since 1995. Since they turned away from that Desmond Child touch.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like this book because it is a chapter book and has pictures<br />I recommend this to children 5 years old to 12 years old
B0091REZMW|5.0|love the game. this game is a great work out for your eyes n brain. keep this type of game going.
B007V4530A|5.0|I often give technical presentations that boil down to death by PowerPoint. Slide after slide of bullet points and technical jargon really wasn't what I wanted to do. I have no doubt my audience wasn't thrilled about it. I've always wanted to fashion my presos after TED talks and this book is the perfect little manual for doing so. Needless to say, I have a lot more fun giving my talks. I think my audience is happy with the changes as well.
B004SBULWE|5.0|this app is great. Saves battery use because it will kill apps that you dont even know are running in the background. I recommend it for your tablets and phones. I have it on all my devices that can access the intranet.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I really enjoyed this story. A beautifully woven fable that is both old world and modern. There are so many wonderful and memorable lines. A must read!!!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Love this book series. It's almost just like you're watching the Castle TV show. Sometimes the chase sequences in New York are a little confusing for me since I'm not familiar with the city, but all in all, a great read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this story, it was predictable but it was still a really good read! I would recommend it to anyone!
B000I9X7M6|5.0|I love the guns that they are arled with.Sexy.I also love the cars,the tattoo on the back of the priest.It was very queensryche + Braveheart all in 1 !!!
B00881VLCE|3.0|Good game when bored.  I don't purchase puzzles, I only download the free puzzles so I don't run into problems when updates are released.
B008458O3S|5.0|Hard to beat but not impossible.  Lots of fun!  Beginning levels are great for kids and later levels are great for adults.
B0053O8ARI|5.0|I love this show. I love the dirty, witty humor! Cracks me up every single episode, and I'm not someone who typically laughs out loud watching a tv show. I wish I can go back in time and watch it for the first time again. I love all the characters in the diner. Hilarious.
1419701533|5.0|Great visible appeal to my daughter and she will actually read these! The reading level is appropriate for the age.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Got gifted this for Christmas with a new Nikon 600 and 2 lens. I have to say - when I saw the bag I was not thrilled as I just purchased a much more expensive well known brand backpack to go with the camera. Originally I was going to include the bigger bag and keep the Amazon bag as a back up of sorts.<br /><br />But Amazon really got it right with this one. The size is much easier to carry and maneuver than the other bulky case but you don't sacrifice protection with the smaller size. While the LOWEPRO sits lonely in the corner waiting for the day it needs to carry more gear ... the Amazon backpack gets used daily.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I absolutely love this game. It has good graphics, great gameplay and it never ends! The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because of the accounts. I personally don't have a Facebook so I couldn't sign in. You might think, Okay, so what? Well, as you might know there is no other way to sign in. So I was level 23, had 4 or 5 epics and had spent about $15 on gems, and one day I was forced to reset my kindle to factory defaults and my park was gone. If I could have signed in with my e-mail I could have saved it and not wasted all that money. So if I could say one thing to the developers, it would be, &quot;Make a way to create an account with e-mail. Other than that this is my absolute favorite game!
B00ALYY6ZA|2.0|The 5:2 diet plan is pretty simple, two days a week you keep your calories to a minuscule 500/600 per day and the rest of the week eat normally.  The author claims that a) you will lose weight and b) it will dramatically improve your long term health.<br /><br />Let me address the first part.  I have been trying the diet for a couple of weeks and it has been working for me.  I am one of those people that has that stubborn last 10-15 pounds to lose and I have made more progress, down about 8 lbs since trying the diet.  I find the diet really easy to follow, basically 2 days a week I watch what I eat and keep to the 600 calories.  On those days, I drink more coffee and tea then usual to keep myself from eating, but once resigned to a fast day, basically you just have to make it through the day.  I pick Mondays because they stink anyhow and one other day.  Oddly, once you get used to it, the fasting is really no big deal.  I get hungry a couple times a day and it is amazing a cup of green tea and the hunger goes away.  While 600 calories is not a lot, it is enough to function, work and workout without any difficulties.<br /><br />I do truly believe that this plan will work for me long term as I consider it more of a strategy then a diet. (The strategy concept was in the book.)  Basically, I need to cut my calories down and was not very good at knocking off 500 calories a day for a week by eating slightly less.  So this I think will work for me.  (I will circle back in a month with a weight update.)<br /><br />Moving to the book.  I have two issues with the book.  The plan is so blazingly simple (which may be part of its appeal) that you really don't need a book.  Cut your calories to 500/600 per day twice a week and that is what you do.  Once you get your goal weight go to one day a week.  If you start gaining weight back go back to 2 days.  That is pretty much it, not sure why it takes more than a page or two to explain.  Heck I just explained it in 2 sentences.  Dieting is not rocket science, people need to eat less and burn more to lose weight.  This is one simple strategy for eating less.<br /><br />My second complaint about the book is that it has all sorts of medical claims.  The reality is that the diet is too new and the claims are not supported by hard scientific evidence in my view.  The book is full of anecdotal evidence from people who have been on the diet and also from some studies about fasting.  Not what I call hard science.  I have a lot of trouble believing all the fantastic medical claims that the book put forward.  I am not saying that they are not true, but what I am saying is it is too early and there is too little data.<br /><br />In conclusion, I just don't see any point to the book.  There are plenty of articles out there on the diet, and getting started is really simple, the book in my view didn't add enough value for me to justify the price and time I spent reading it.ing is not rocket science, people need to eat less and burn more to lose weight.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I'm typically a mystery/thriller/horror kind of gal so take my review for what it's worth.  I only bought these books because I got them super cheap during one of Amazon's Lightning Deals and I was intrigued by all the hype.<br /><br />First book was awful, the second and third had some action (crazy, gun-toting ex-lovers & car chases), but the ending was just as lame as the rest of the storyline.  Also, if you're looking for steamy sex scenes, look elsewhere.  Your great grandmother probably has better sex than these main characters.  All in all, I thought the books were bizarre at best and I wouldn't recommend them... Especially to someone who doesn't typically dabble in this genre.
B004GYY714|5.0|This should've been out in the 80's!!! I listen to it everyday on my phone, kindle and online. I love it more then Pandora but the only downfall that it doesn't offer that Pandora does, is the shuffle between genre and playlist. Once it adds that I'm never using any other online radio(well until something else comes along better and blow tunein out the water).
B0092ZEIN4|5.0|very good product, battery last long, and easy to connect<br /><br />also connects to the PC and you can use it with any emulator
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great book! Couldn't stop reading. It had a great message to it and it left me wanting so much more
1455508977|5.0|A U.S. Marine, Logan Thibault, finds a photograph of a young woman while serving his duties. He begins to have good luck because he \\"won more than he'd earned\\" (Sparks 22) by playing poker. His best friend, Victor, is the only one who believes the photograph is good luck. When he returns to Colorado, he packs up his stuff and sets out on a journey to find this beautiful young woman in the picture. His journey leads him to Elizabeth, a divorced mother with a son in Elementary School.  When he first meets Elizabeth, he doesn't tell her the secret of the photograph and why he came to North Carolina. Logan falls madly in love with Elizabeth but Logan's secret soon threatens to tear them apart. The Lucky One is filled with romance and intense tragedies. I recommend this book to woman and girls who love dogs, romance, drama, and loves being outdoors. This book is filled with these. I personally liked this book because it had romance but at the same time it had family drama. I believe this book is a chick flick but at the same time I believe that guys would like this book also. The Lucky One is has twists and turns. As I was reading this book, I could picture everything that was going on. Nicholas Sparks creates really good imagery in every single book he has written, but my favorite book of his is The Lucky One. I rate this book 5 stars because of how detailed his chapters are. I would read this book again because of how dramatic and intense it is.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie is very special . I would reccomend it to any adult who cares about people with disabilities .
B000GCFG7E|4.0|The surprising twist in the story line make this an interesting read. But it does stretches on the reality aspect.
034580404X|3.0|Heard so much about this from others that I finally broke down and bought it. Wasn't disappointed and it did keep me reading for serveral days. However, by the 3rd book I was getting bored. I've read racier books than this so not sure what the hype was about. Sex scenes weren't that dramatic that I was offended. To me it was a nice romantic read that kept me wanting to know how it would end.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Very hard to put the book down... His drive and commitment make it hard to quit anything when I am faced with much less.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|This was a really good movie, I didn't expect the adult to be telling a story about the trip on the life boat. The 3d graphics were very well done,hope that bodes well for other new movies to do a quality job with the mode. I thought the acting was pretty good, not great. The story and camera work carried the movie for me.
B00AECGQF2|3.0|This app is awesome, but toca could really increase their profit if they would just add their other apps to the android/Amazon market. Just look at the number of reviews, and probably only 1/2 the people who bought it wrote one, if you multiply that by 2.99, that's a lot of cash, even when you subtract the cost of manufacturing. And for the record, I love  toca, the kids I babysit do too. I have all the apps on my iPhone but it would be much more practical if I had them on my tablet, which is much easier to handle with toddlers. (I can't afford an iPad, I'm only 13...)
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Wow wow and wow! This was one of the most incredible books I've read in quite a while. I would stop reading for a few minutes and just think of myself in her situation. I couldn't fathom dealing with that type of terror on a daily basis. Great job Elizabeth Haynes!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I think everyone should try this game if you love mysterious games I loved it and if you love mystery games this one is desirability for you
B008MM9630|3.0|I love this game but what makes me mad is that u got new pics for new ways to play the game but when I take the game out to reinstill it its the same game from Christmas plz fix it and if it gets fix i would get it a 5 starving play it on my kindle
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't write a longer review, because I have to start the next book! :)  just read them all...trust me!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works well, plays like the actual card game.  I enjoy the basic game without unnecessary flashy graphics or sounds.  The hint feature is nice when I want use it.
B004V45YBG|1.0|This book was a complete waste of his talent.  It read like a set of index cards written by someone who was going to give a talk or write an article.  Not a novel in any sense.  I gave it one star because I couldn't submit it with zero.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|This book was chosen for our book club and was one of the best and most memorable selections in recent memory.  Many of our members read it in one sitting because they literally could not put the book down.  You will be trapped once you start!  The author did a fantastic job of developing the characters and the storyline.  I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates a good mystery, as well as a book that will tug at your heart.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|Season 3 is an wxciting season of twists.  Several new characters.  A tad of romance.  more suspense.  more Red John.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun :) worth the download. a great game for horsey minded people, stable cleaning, competitions, games - just really don't care for the ads!! would be complete without them
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this game on my Kindle Fire a while back.  Enjoy it.  After progressing through most of the levels, though, it gets a bit tedious just running around and jumping things.  Good mindless fun, though.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|This third masterpiece in Zafon's trilogy is excellent.  I'm enthralled with Zafon, how he weaves his characters and plots and thoughts.  In really enjoy true literature and this fits the bill.  I would read this last even tho some say they can be standalone .  Don't know how without losing the flavor.<br />Must read.
1446303314|3.0|This dollmaker has the most beautiful books, however, the instructions are lacking.  I am a dollmaker and love looking at the photos.  I have made her dolls, it is good that I can sew and really did not need instructions.  It is written for a British audience and pretty funny in places.  Given that, it is still not an instruction book, just a pretty one.  None of the accessories are available in the States, however I always want to my &#34;girls&#34; my own creation so look for a way to accomplish a one-of-kind doll.  This a nice book, just not the best for instruction
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the first book I have read by her and loved it.  It is a smooth read and has suspense along with happy and sad moments.  I recommend it for anyone.  I am now going back and reading some of her other work.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|If you are buying this movie on Bluray, you don't care at all about a movie review.  Besides, who cares about a subjective review of a movie anyways?  Watch it yourself.  The jacket and design of this movie is the best I have come across; not a slip-cover, the box is actually a steelbook-type jacket containing the film and covered with movie artwork.  Very nice for the price.
B00B47NO2O|5.0|Loved this show right from the start.  There is no bad Kevin Bacon show. Story is incredible. Recommend strongly- you ont regret it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love the game. I have No complaints except that it is addicting! That isn't really a complaint though!! I can sit and play this game for hours!!
B000Z27HLS|1.0|I was greatly disapointed with this movie. In my opinion, Jane Austen wrote \\"Northanger Abbey\\" as a humorous dipiction of old gothic novels and their effect on an innocent mind; however, it seems the producer/script writer of this piece didn't agree.<br /><br />First of all, in the book, Catherine does not begin reading novels until she meets Isabella in Bath. Her character is completely wrong! She is intended as a simple, innocent girl- not clever, but certainly not dumb. Here, she seems occasionally too clever, overly imaginative, and in an attempt to appear naive, she almost constantly leaves her mouth hanging open.<br /><br />Henry Tilney, on the cover, looks very Henry-ish. Not so on the screen. May have been good, if they had left Jane Austen's dialogue intact. He lacked all cleverness, charm, and humor.<br /><br />Eleanor Tilney looked more suited to be Henry's mother than sister, and the Allens' were bufoonish, very badly done.<br /><br />Austen's humor was completely lost in this badly acted, badly written adaptation of her novel. Over all, the air of this film was too modern. The actors' didn't have any of the propriety of address needed to convey an authentic feeling of the time period. Not what we expected from Andrew Davies, as he usually captures Austen's wit and emotion very nicely. (Oh it is a nice word!)<br /><br />Update 7/8/13<br />I recently viewed the older BBC adaptation, and it too, is a loser. Why can't anyone make a decent and faithful film out of this great story??
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I didn't think I would like this game, but my son got me addicted to it. Has lots of helpful clues.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|The game was exciting and just the right difficulty for me. I like the type of hint function in this game. It gives you the direction you need to go next so you don't just wander around lost.<br />Kialover
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|The game is fun andd challenging.  The only problem I have is, sometimes the hidden items don't always connect when I touch the screen.  All in all it is a good game.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Often a book about characters that are sick makes me feel melancholy and sad.  This book made me feel inspired and positive about life.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Awesome!  I loved every moment and couldn't stop reading.  Brilliantly told story where I connected too closely with the characters and was afraid for them.  Can't imagine anyone to whom I wouldn't recommend the book.  I'm mostly a non-fiction / business book reader and am a Navy veteran.  This book has it all.<br /><br />I think this is my first review ever and I'm writing it per your request in the Q&A as the best way I know of to say thank-you for giving us this gift.  I'd love to see a special addition hardcover bound in a tin like the Legacy :)
B00AFEXRME|4.0|Denzel  is  one  of  the  great  !  actors  love  him  in everything  he  is  surely  a  20  Million  dollar  actor  no  doubt  just  keep  them  coming  !!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My son really loves this game. I'm not really into the whole gun thing but welcome to real life. As long as my son understands the difference which he does, then he can play
B007REV4T8|5.0|Daniel  Craig  is  a great  bond  actor  saw  all  his  bond  movies  please  keep  them coming  can't  wait  for  the next  Bond  movie  !!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great  game that helps children react to their surroundings quick. My son is 3 and can play this game like a pro. Its really fun
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|A fun matching game! I like to play fof a few mins between other tasks just to relaxation at in Zen mode. Perfect for me.
B0038JN6VA|4.0|Loud, the sound quality is pretty good. Easy to carry.With MP3 function.But the song selection is a bit troublesome.The batteries are more durable.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Dark, eerie yet strangely realistic...  Love this show and loved how easy it was to watch on Amazon's Instant Video!
B00A3AYI50|5.0|Watched this young man start out & win on American Idol and absolutely LOVE his music. Will definately buy any new songs.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|This movie was better than the first one.  I really enjoyed both of them and I am hoping there will be an Expendables 3 !!!  Again if  I could rate this a ten I would.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is a dictionary that has a lot of helpful definitions I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good dictionary
B004AQR29C|5.0|If I could rate this movie a ten I would! One of the best movies I've ever seen. I love Sylvester Stallone.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|The film &#34;Perks of Being a Wallflower&#34; is magical. Dark, serious, and humerous for all the wrong reasons that it just feels right.<br /><br />The book... In my opinion, the book leaves a lot to be desired. Many of my friends sang it's praises as an innovative, epistolary journey of a young man learning what it really means to live. And perhaps it is. I truly had difficulty appreciating it because of how elementary the writing was.<br /><br />And even through all of this, when the book concluded I was left feeling very pensive about life, and saddned by all that we will never be able to shelter our children from.
B008XG1X18|4.0|It took me a long time to get into Pinterest, until I realized if I pin something I will always know where to find it again!  And if I need ideas all I have to do is search and 99% of the time I find it on someone's board :)  I use it at least once a day.  This app tends to be slow-loading on my Kindle at times, otherwise I'd rate it 5 stars.
B006SAR6P8|5.0|If you've seen Vol. 1 then you need to watch Vol. 2. it answers all the questions asked in Vol. 1<br />FREAKIN SWEET MOVIE
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Book was so beautifully written about someone with mental health issue's.  The movie was really good but enjoyed the book.
B001609SQA|5.0|Personally I prefer this movie to Alien, where alien is more of a horror flick, this movie has more action and holds very true to the story line of the first Alien movie. If you enjoy Si-Fi movies this is a must see.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read all three of the series I really think that this is the best one.<br />It kept my attention and once I started it I couldn't put it down...actually books 2 and 3 both were like this.<br />The first was a little slow.
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|After seeing Django Unchained I had to get more Tarantino so I rented Kill Bill Vol. 1 and loved the insane action and spotty story line. Vol. 2 fills in all the holes in the story of Vol. 1. I watched both movies one right after the other.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|Very good  Toys story 2 DVd excellent quality . Will be back for more and more .Thanks alot for sending
0439023513|5.0|This was my favorite book of the trilogy. While the theme was not as startling (let's face it, we all know how Panem is by now), the psychological elements are brilliantly written. There are enough plot twists to keep you interested and anxious.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Great artist and great cd. Excellent quality no copy will buy again with out hesitation. Thanks for us being able to buy such good music from here
B004SBQGHS|5.0|This is alot better then the free version with all the ads. I am going to switch all my Angry Birds over to ad free.

B00AQKEPMI|5.0|Disney films for the last 10 years or so have just been awful.  Well, the animated ones anyway... and with only 3 exceptions that come to mind.  (Wall-e, Bolt, and Monsters,Inc.)  Thankfully, we have Dreamworks, who has not only picked up the slack; but has vastly surpassed them in both Quality and Entertainment for ALL Ages, and left Disney Animation coughing on their pixel-dust!  (no, not a type-o... Pixel Dust, haha)  (and did Disney even own Pixar when Monsters, Inc. came out???)<br /><br />The last 10 years for Dreamworks however, have been awesome, with only a couple \\"misses\\".  They've brought us Kung-Fu Panda (and a Super-Killer sequel)... How To Train Your Dragon... Monsters Vs Aliens... Megamind... Puss In Boots (loved it / didn't like the Shreks personally)... and many others... And now they've added this Disney-knock-out punch, Rise of The Guardians.<br /><br />Kind of makes you wonder what the Hell is wrong with Disney... And why they can't ever seem to get their act together, for more than 3-4 films, out of every 30 they release.  Aside from the \\"classics\\" (which I never really cared for all that much), their BEST films, ever, animation-wise, are unquestionably, The Little Mermaid (#1), The Lion King (#2), and Wall-e (#3)... Though obviously, many will disagree with the placement with 1 or all... But... Story, Originality, FUN (EVERY TIME), Engaging & Entertaining FOR ALL AGES... When looked at through that lens, I'm sure most will agree.  (Sorry; but Beauty & The Beast, is not top 10... way too many story/plot holes -- The \\"age of the prince\\" being the most glaring, with \\"convenient (sloppy) writing\\" throughout, and most of the songs are neither catchy, nor even good.  The Little Mermaid should've won the award(s), w/o a doubt, not B&TB... but since TLM didn't; and the co-composer who did both, died (of aids), they gave him the posthumous-pity-award to make up for it, plain and simple.)<br /><br />Rise of The Guardians, is the kind of film, you'd expect (or at least, USE to expect) Disney to create... something that speaks to the child in all of us, yet is still greatly engaging & entertaining for all ages...<br />-- These days, Disney can barely put a decent story together, let alone, create something with the above characteristics.  And while, many of the Dreamworks films (like Monsters vs Aliens, Megamind, H.T.T.Y.D., etc.) are certainly not going to be on anyone's \\"top 10 list\\"... they still kick the butt of anything Disney has made in recent past, w/ the exception of Wall-e of course, as that is in my \\"top 3\\" obviously.<br /><br />Best of all, regarding this film... IT'S ORIGINAL.  They didn't take some \\"classic fairy tale\\" & put a weird twist on it, then take all the credit for the story (as was Disney's custom & how they built their 'empire').  Don't get me wrong, I'm not anti-Disney... Hell, I'm a member of their Reward Program; and LOVE more than a few of their movies; and have upgraded (most) to 3D!... But, that's not going to keep me from calling a spade a spade... And honestly, Disney has Sold Us Out For Far Too Long... whether that be through bad Managers, or complacent Animators... I'm pretty sick of it either way... So, THANK YOU, DREAMWORKS!!<br /><br />PS: I'm rather urked that they made Santa Claus RUSSIAN???  WTF!?<br />-- Making the Easter Bunny, Australian, is one thing... Whatever... You want the \\"cast\\" to be \\"International\\"... I get it... But when you think of Christmas, the LAST Country that comes to mind, is RUSSIA!! _ Plus, you'd have to completely discount the actual, GERMAN, beginnings/heritage of Santa Claus... (CLAUS, HELLO!!)... which would've lent itself to your \\"International\\" theme... and therefore makes NO sense, and no explanation is even attempted, as to why he's Russian, or why the Bunny is an Aussie.  (or why he has Russian-style tattoos all over his arms)<br />--I don't know... that really, really bugged me... But, by the end of the film, I was so pleased with everything else, I figured 'why get hung up?'.  A lesser film, and that definitely would've been a coffin-nail (no-sale)... So, if you can get past that (and try not to think about it), you should enjoy this film, immensely... so, Enjoy!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this app is so fun. I  really like it. I gave a problem that I don't like to talk about.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I just got Dragon Vale so far this game has been awesome there are no pushy ad's trying to get you to download anything else and it seems to be fun for all ages from kids to adults alike will be playing for awhile I think.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|Great service. Great sound. Great movie. Great actor. The DVD played w/o any problems. I have all his movies like them all.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Not for you if you need constant violence, but a nice compelling show. Suitable for the whole family (though my husband would hate it).
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Dean Holder AKA Holder ...ohhh the things he says to Sky ...it just sweeps you off your feet and they're in High school!  Really?! High school!!  Sky is long lost and Dean is right there with her ...little did they both know they were on the same path the whole time.  Great story.
B00821PCJS|5.0|Makes me want to get a bunker built!  Not as gory as the Walking Dead, but fun & a bit scary.
B000LC51TM|5.0|Wow!  This dvd was awesome. It was well worth the money. It was so exciting watching my favorite group.  It felt like I was there with them. This is the best dvd that I own.  If you love Rammstein, then you have to buy this.
B000Y5JFNE|4.0|Based on some recent older films being released on Blu-ray I didn't expect the best transfer for Willow, however the video quality and the audio quality are outstanding. I was very suprised and quite happy with the purchase over-all. The extras are decent for this particular movie and we will enjoy it again and again for years to come.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B0010X8NF0|5.0|Have seen this a few times and it has a pleasant plot with some black comedy to it.  Gets you in the mood for Indian food.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Total well done &#34;B&#34; movie - excellent special effects....Star Wars vs Blazing Saddles,,,,,worth two or three viewing that will offend pretty much everyone.  A must see......really!!!
B00296A4F4|5.0|Love the music from each episode, the dances and the drama. Besides all of that you can see all the problems that teenagers have now days. Great show!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Love reading Nicholas Sparks and this is another great story.  Couldn't put the book down.  Highly recommend reading to others
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I absolutely HAD to have the second book immediately after reading the first. I could not wait to go to the store to buy it, so I bought it as an ebook. So glad I did!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|So  i hate reading. But I picked up this book out of my mom's office, didn't think I would've finished it, but I loved it. Never have  I ever cried while reading a book, but tonight  as I read page 261, the years streamed down. If you ever need a good book, read this book. You will not regret it  I promise  you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After readying the first and second, I could not wait to start this one; therefore, I bought it as an ebook immediately.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Can't wait for the next episode to come on. Love the characters and the story line. Always waiting for the surprise in every episode.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down! I am definitely on the Fifty Shades bandwagon and could not stop after the first one. I went on and bought the next two as an ebook because I could not wait to see what happened next. I wish the story would go on and on and keep me as engrossed as this one did.
B0053TMP24|4.0|At first I couldn't really concentrate on it. Even though it had Percy in it it just didn't feel right without Annenbeth or the other characters in the other book, but after a while I couldn't put the book down. It's a great book.<br /><br />I myself seriously can't wait to read THE MARK OF ATHENA and learn more about all the characters.  I hope we get to see more of hazel and Frank but I really can't wait for more of percy and Annenbeth since she was left out like I mentioned ealier
0061122092|5.0|I am pleased at how quickly my book arrived. It came well before the expected arrival date. I am in love with this book, and write down quotes from it often. Great read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book! I did think that I am a little young to read it becuase somethimes it got really sexual. I would recommend it to any teenager but the target audience is DEFINATELY for adults. Also loved the movie!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|I TRULY BELIEVE THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD SHOW THIS VIDEO TO ALL STUDENTS AND FACULTY SURE GETS YOU THINKING
0425188809|5.0|I first read this book when it was published.  It is the best dog story! AND a really scary thriller.ordered 2 copies so mine won't get lost!
B007REV4YI|5.0|One of the best Bond movies yet. A good mix of classic Bond and modern Bond, epic in scale with beautiful and dark locations. Must see for any Bond fan.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Downloaded for the grand daughter to use on a long flight - held her attention the entire time this flight
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fantastic series. My son and I read all three together and look forward to seeing the characters come to life in the movies! :)
0061743526|5.0|I read this book for a class and at first I didn't like it. Then, it got so much better. I absolutely love this book. It is very touching and it is a great story told by a very sweet narrator. I recommend it.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have an older car that has no lights in which to find stations, this is great.  I no longer need cds as I loaded all my favorite song on a flash drive.  Was able to create directories.  Love it!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The trilogy all together in one download at a wonderful price! Who isn't hungry for this type of deal? Buying all three books together was motivation for me to complete my reading. Love this!
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This is a lol book it rocks  I rate it 5 stars this is the cool book but  Greg can be nicer I love THE LAST STRAW DIARY OF A WIMPY KID BOOK 3 another good book Jeff Kinney
0060922583|5.0|This book was fantastic, nicely weaving together seemingly unrelated phenomenon into a cohesive theory of the universe. If you are at all interested in new theories of the universe or spirituality, you need to read this book!!
1455502626|4.0|Picked this book up based on a review, and I'm glad I did. The police humor and antagonism between local and federal departments rang true to the core. Well written without being too descriptive just to fill some pages. Looking forward to the rest of Mr DeMille's books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game it's additive but i'm really getting fed up with trying to update this game if someone could please help me out here i'm about to delete the whole thing it's really stressing me out..
B0077ZNCE2|5.0|This movie kept me hanging to see the second part. Twilight the saga is a must have movie in your collection.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|\\"And in that moment we were infinite\\"<br />This book totally captured all of the struggles of being a teenager and displayed them wonderfully through the eyes of Charlie. This is a must read for everyone.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is a great app and u can adjust the volume of the alarms so they don't freak u out! I recommend this app for Kindle Fire.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I like this.  Its different and can be a challenge on some of the puzzles. The puzzle is basically scrambled tubes that a chemical will need to flow through from point a to b and its your goal to align the tubes for proper flow.<br />I haven't got too far but have seen color coded tubes that if you mix the wrong tubes it becomes poison. So you really need to think in this one.<br />Fun and my son enjoyed it until it got too tough. I didn't see any easy modes etc but that's fine.<br />I would recommend this.<br />Florida mom
B0097PW7H8|5.0|Especially for someone very visual. This app has helped save my battery life. If you need a bit more explanation this is for you.
B0036RCVJW|4.0|I do not think that this book deserves a 5 star rating, simply because the main plot seems to me quite unfeasible and too far fetched. However the redeeming factor is Mankell's very fascinating elaborations on modern day China and the Chinese communities in western countries, (here the UK) their organisations and strengths. Quite enlightening.  And as always, his settings in Sweden, its people and their lives in a totally socialist system despite having a King is most enlightening. A good read if not the greatest.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is wonderful true story of man's concern for man, even in times of war. Need more of this type of book.
B002RKSZS0|5.0|Having read other Austen works, I wasn't really sure what this was about. It took me awhile to follow it all but I loved the character of Catherine. I am like her in many ways being that my imagination gets away from me. The characters were enjoyable though some I couldn't believe how they acted even in that time period.<br /><br />I enjoyed all the descriptions and the settings though I felt the leading up to Northanger Abbey took a little too long but that was just me. Henry was a good character and I loved his sister Eleanor.<br /><br />Reading off the Kindle app on my phone worked well, whether I read it horizontal or vertical. I was quite pleased with no errors and how easily it would flip from one direction to the other without losing a lot of content on the page.<br /><br />All in all, I am defintely wanting to read more of her books and would like to own in a hardcopy some day. But for now, I know I can go back and re-read it over and over if the mood so strikes me wherever I am at.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Movie did good job of getting the viewer involved in the search for a performer who had not received the credit due him and brought a strong emotional attachment to this character's life.  Also, his music was effectively imbedded in the story and was very engaging.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Lots of pockets and you can adjust the slot sizes which is handy. I dont like that it doesnt attach to the bottom of the bad to things (like memory cars and extra lens caps) can float around which isnt fun.. Other than that its GREAT and I love it despiste the little issue.
B00AHTYGRW|5.0|This truly deserves the best movie of the year.  It is very well done and even though I knew that all would be well I was still tense.  A real nail biter even when you know how it ends.
0547569653|5.0|Scott tells a wonderful story, full of humour and humanity.  He's real about his emotions and how he feels.  A great book to read, and the included vegan recipes are great.  I've made a couple so far and every one has been a winner!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you missed any of season 3 on tv. Great entertainment. I also ordered season one and two at the same time, so we enjoyed many hours of Downton as a family
1455502758|5.0|Christopher Hitchens was a throwback to the great intellectuals of earlier times when thinking was more widely practiced without the chatter of modern diversions. He faced his own death and mortality with courage and acceptance. The believing world had hoped for a \\"death-bed\\" conversion but Christopher was too authentic for that. He lived life fully and did not need the panacea of an after life.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|If you missed seasons 1 and 2 as I did, this DVD set is worth every penny. My husband, daughter and I watched it together. We spent an entire weekend enjoying Downton with all its family and staff. We missed parts of season 3 so I ordered that set too.  Now we can't wait for season 4 to return to TV
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a great product. The characters are fun and the the game is quite interesting. The only problem is that it hangs up once in a while, but it always recovers quickly.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I watched the movie first and the two were similar, but not the same.  The book was good and it was hard to put down, but the movie was awesome!
0307352153|5.0|Which people do we value in society? Which people do we acclaim in schools? What skills promise a life of value and success, and how has that changed over time? According to Susan Cain, about a third of Americans are \\"quiet.\\" We are introverts--the buzz and excitement of a party may not terrorize us, but it does leave us drained. We go home to recover when the show's over, while our extrovert friends, enlivened by all the excitement, go on to party elsewhere. And we can succeed, but in a world, or at least a country, that doesn't value our quietness, we struggle to respect our own strengths instead of concentrating on our weaknesses.<br />Have you ever wondered why so much of a student's score in class comes from group projects and classroom interaction? What about the good old days when grades depended on measurable learning? If you're like me, you've certainly known students who get straight As on their homework but score a C in the class, because they're \\"shy.\\" Have you ever wondered why we waste so much time adoring the stars of Hollywood, or demanding our politicians shine like rock stars? Or have you stopped to think how the Warren Buffets and Steve Jobs of our world are actually a) hugely successful because they're b) supremely intelligent introverts?<br />Author Susan Cain goes on a journey not just through the psychology books, but also through Harvard Business School, a super-hyped up Tony Robbins Experience, even Saddleback Evangelical church (in a section entitled Does God Love Introverts), and the internet. Surprisingly, the internet, with its lack of boundaries and fully invaded privacy, presents the place where introverts thrive just as much as extroverts, and the instinct to stop and think before responding is a recognizable advantage.<br />Broken marriages, lost jobs, lonely children, or relationships mended, freedom and success, children who find their way after all, all illustrate the theme. In the end the author reminds us \\"love is essential; gregariousness is optional.\\" We don't all have to live in our comfort zones, but we might need to retreat to them once in a while. And the world needs the quietly considered strength of Rosa Parks just as much as it needs the speeches of Martin Luther King Jr.<br />A pleasingly readable book, teaching through experience, sharing a journey, and leading to a place where extrovert and introvert just might be able to recognize value in each other, Quiet is the sort of book you'll quietly recommend to many, and I'm certainly glad I got to read it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received a free copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.gariousness is optional.\\" We don't all have to live in our comfort zones, but we might need to retreat to them once in a while.

B0049U4NQO|5.0|This was a great book I really enjoyed it and recommend anyone who is interested in adventure this would be the perfect fit.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|a classic, and a free book for kindle. can't beat that. everyone that owns a kindle should download these free classics!
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Good enough to eat popcorn too...not overly enthralling, but was a pleasant diversion for the family for a movie night.
B002RKSCA6|5.0|a classic, and a free book for kindle. can't beat that. everyone that owns a kindle should download these free classics!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is one of the best alarm clocks a girl could ever own.  Say &#34;so long&#34; to your conventional alarm clock.  With this app, I have so many customizable options it puts traditional clocks to shame- it amazing.  I definitely recommend this.
B000JQV68A|5.0|a classic, and a free book for kindle. can't beat that. everyone that owns a kindle should download these free classics!
B009LYQE2E|5.0|I love one piece and every one knows FiguArts gives good quality for a good price... just get it if you are a one piece fan :D
B003U4UNPK|4.0|Expose is still not accessible after several months.  Customer Service has it as a know problem, but I don't know why it's taking so long to fix.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love this game. It is very mysterious and exciting. You never know what is going to happen next. I would recommend this game to all of my friends.
B00BLCHZC2|4.0|The first episode was engaging and worthy of following subsequent episodes. The cinematography and acting, thus far, made this episode worth our time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i downloaded the app but quickly deleted it, it wasnt what i expected so i stuck with the one i had
0425252868|5.0|A stunning story! You just can't make this stuff up! When I read a published review, I knew I had to have this book and then could not put it down. Well written and thoroughly researched for historical certitude. I can't say enough about this heart-wrenching and heart-breaking true story. Son of a WWII Veteran. I cried.
B007ZKY7XO|5.0|this band's body of work is such fun. each album has a distinct feel, which builds on the ones before.  i think this is possibly their very best work.  dig it.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A whole get yo life guide, I LIVE thanks to this book. It has completely changed my entire existence. Read it now
B009DJB8I2|2.0|I purchased this soundtrack for some days only because of the TF2 item code and the DotA 2 one. But when I received the box there were only the CDs and no codes! I could had downloaded it for free but now I wasted 15$!<br /><br />But the soundtrack is still good. Therefor 2 stars...
B00328G4V6|5.0|The quality of the recording on this CD is Awesome. I was worried about the technology from 41 years ago and even though they advertised this as being remastered I wasn't a believer until I listened.<br /><br />Jimi was a rocker but this disc really shows his blues roots well. Instrumentation is rich thick sound. If you love the blues and you love Jimi Hendrix - buy it.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Captain America is a fun, entertaining film. Good adventure and very good special effects.  Pretty good story line but fairly predictable.  I recommend this movie if you just want to be entertained for 90 or so minutes.
B009A87Z6U|3.0|Product would not play on some of my Blu-ray players ( all of which are Sony ), it would only play on my oldest player ( Model BDP-S360 ) and would not play on my other three players ( Model BDP-S470 ).
B007HO392S|5.0|This is a pretty good album. I am very picky on what county albums I get and this is pretty good. I really love the song Blown Away. This is why I bought this album. Carrie has a beautiful voice and her songs really tell a story. Enjoyed.
B0070YDOT8|1.0|Very disappointed with this game. The reels spin very very slow which makes is boring. Also your score or credits is very hard to view.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This film gives viewers a new twist on Santa and how presents are delivered on Christmas and is an adorable film the entire family can enjoy!
1936850028|5.0|For all of the outdoor enthusiast out there, I have book recommendation for you; \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" by Walter Rhein. This book is such a fun read. You just can't help smiling as you turn the pages of this very entertaining book. Most of us can relate to some of the things that Walter goes through in his life. I laughed from cover to cover. I've read it twice. I've even also bought a few extra copies for my pals. Buy it and enjoy.<br /><br />Marty Mathis
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|my sister and i are musical groupies!! lol! we were so excited to go and see this movie. we honestly expected to be somewhat disappointed simply because as most people know films normally leave out a lot and fail to capture the essence of what is really going on.  this movie surprised me! its wonderful. kept me on the edge of my seat even though i knew what was going to happen having see the concert several times and the non musical movie a couple times as well. gerard butler and hugh jackman are extraordinary actors and anne hathoway never fails to please. i couldnt believe it when as we watched the movie i saw sooo many people from my favorite movies. its truly an all star cast that for once didnt fail miserably. if your emotional like me? you will be laughing and crying from beginning to end. worth the watch even if you arent into musicals. its just a very good movie about an escaped parolee and the cop who has to find him. the people he meets and influences. the french revolution. suspenseful and simply breathtaking.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series. Loved watching via amazon prime it streamed nicely no delays. Good quality picture.  wait to watch the next season
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Movie was totally different than I expected.  Denzel did a good job with the role.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B008N1LL42|4.0|Apparently it did poorly with critics. No big deal they are usually fully wrong on what I ever like. It was enjoyable due to a lot of action, good cinematography, At least the game had good homage paid, made in the alien weaponry and the tracking method used in the film. Not a mind churning movie by any stretch of the imagination but great for a sitdown and have a beer movie.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|This was a great watch. Gives a bit for the older generation and still lets the kiddos enjoy it. John Lasseter was involved so what can go wrong.
1451695195|3.0|It was probably an excellent book for a highly intellectual person to read, but I thought he made it sound as if<br />there is no hell and all would be going to heaven at death.  Jesus is the only way.  I wondered if when he first found<br />himself in the bubbling non-existant atmosphere, he was not experiencing a level of hell.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|He brought back the SNL cast once again. It was a fun watch. Honestly the hippy was a bit annoying at times. Worth a watch for the normal Sandler comedy.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Ok, this story was slow to get going, but it was fun and engaging enough for me to stick with it.  I bought it hoping for a bit of a spook, but it really wasn't, in fact you could probably read this to most kids 9-10 or above without upsetting their little psyches.  My main issue with this book was that it just suddenly seemed to end without much resolution of anything, the reader is left hanging with the sense that this must have been intended as a cliff hanger pending a sequel.  It didn't need a sequel...it could have been resolved within the length of the book.  Frustrating!
B00ARF92HK|4.0|Thank god, This was much better than anticipated. Mama was a cold woman and she fits the role quite well. Dredd is a freaking B.A. and carries out his duties with no compromise. Anderson was very likable and had no real damsel in distress moments thankfully. Makes me want to read the comics.
1616550414|5.0|This is the best just like that, if you are a Zelda fan you must have this in your collection
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|The best game ever. But it needs more levels. I can't stop playing it, finished it twice and I keep going back to it
B00005A1PR|5.0|She has the most wonderful voice....one of my favorite CD's. My husband gave me this CD and I loved it so much, he bought me a different one. This one is by far her best!!
B000SEI230|5.0|Just an all around good book. This book should be on everyone's \\"must read\\" list. I would recommend it to everyone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I like this book fufjtdyzysyxud :(d tree ysuf :(huh hdyxydhdgvixjdjducjduz :(xxx :( hf :(xux it dydyx hulu xxx uxhz rtf gf :(
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show by far is one of the greatest shows to hit TV. I love this show not just because of the zombies, this show is actually considered to be under the genre of drama. There is plenty of zombie killing but you also really get to know the characters and wonder what they are going to do next. The first season is great! You start your journey with Rick Grimes in the new zombie apocalypse. You follow him through some great situations with zombies and people. The last episode will definitely make you want to know what is going to happen next! If you have yet to watch this series I highly recommend it!
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|Seems slow to translate documents into .pdf. Furthermore, I can't even begin to explain how disappointed and angry I am that Adobe Flash player is not compatible with tablets.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Just one of the best albums of all times, as anyone from my generation knows.  'Coming Back To Me' is just hauntingly beautiful.
B009FZFONO|4.0|Picture and audio quality are fantastic. However, I would prefer that Amazon give you the option to rent episodes for a $1 a day rather than have to buy.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I have not played a game like this one in a long time.  3D match game.  Almost like Mahjong in a rotatable cube and no way to get blocked.  Best time so far is 3 minutes 17 seconds.  Well worth the money.
B000KFB4PK|3.0|I ordered this watch for my 5 year old son and it was cheaper looking than I expected. I wouldn't buy another Lego watch again if the quality of these watches are like the one I just purchased.
B005ZUR724|3.0|Well I bought order & chaos, played for 4 months and now i played an hour and GL has lost my account.<br /><br />I changed my review and started a new account, for now.<br /><br />I love the game, but little notice that the update would wipe out accounts probably would have been received better by the players.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Ghost Protocol was a fun movie in a genre that I and my family like a lot. Great action, but unfortunate that &#34;Sawyer&#34; got knocked off in the first several minutes. Also, the scene in which Tom Cruise's team is impersonating various people in the hotel reminded me a little too much of something from the Three Stooges. Nonetheless, it is a fun movie that I would watch again.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I found the blurb a little misleading once I got into the story and discovered the storyline. I was expecting a totally different read when I sat down, however I was not at all disapointed! In fact I have to say this is one of my favourite all time books.  The writing was beautiful and had the perfect amount of humour while still bringing me to tears in the emotional parts.  I felt that it wasn't at all predictable and even when things didn't go the way I expected or hoped I still felt the story could only have gone the way it did.  The story tackles an controversial subject but I feel it was done in a sensitive way.  Lou Clark is a really likeable main character.  What more you you ask for in a book? It was fantastic and I highly recommend it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|There is only one other weather app I found that is better than this one and that is<br />Weather.com.<br /><br />This offers most of the features that the Weather.com one offers but the Weather Channel videos which I find interesting and informative.<br /><br />Great graphics, accurate information, lovely backgrounds skin when you log on and easy to use.  Highly recommended this one and mine was free!
B004XANKVO|5.0|Love it. I carry my laptop, iPad, cables tools etc.... in my pack. I'm IT tech and I go from site to site all day. My backpack is my desk and tool kit.
B0027MJU00|5.0|distant future.  It's always exciting when new talent emerges this forcefully because readers can look forward to years of enjoyment.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Although this is  listed as a young readers book ( middle school), it was incredibly wonderful as a senior citizen to read this book.  It should definitely be required reading for middle school students.  It deals honestly and openly about all the emotional dilemmas youth of this age face from the young August who lives with a serious birth defect, to the social situations of acceptance and rejection all youth face from time to time.  It is also a good read for more mature readers who will remember some of their own pain and victory at that age.  I highly recommend this book.
034580404X|5.0|Great series, got to admit is was not as great as I had expected from all the hype but overall I enjoyed reading it. I am not usually a romaceish novel reader but it kept my interest and was very stamy and erotic. Be prepare for that if you read it, the sexual content is very strong and may not be for everyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Into every life some gloom will appear.  To watch this group cope and recover and return to glory is magnificent.  Can't wait for season four.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Absolutely love this book! It's directed toward married couples, but I now use what I learned in this book across all of my relationships. Significant other, parents, siblings, roommates... I have also watched it turn my parent's relationship around toward a happier, more loving dynamic. It's a quick read in proportion to how much can be learned from this book. Highly recommended!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Although a few many crisis situations are crammed into each episode they are delightful to watch to the end.  I just wish they would slow it down a bit so the joy of watching could linger.
0425238091|5.0|Read this book if you have any experience in inpatient medicine or if you want to know what it can really be like. The book can be offensive, but it's real.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|its the simpicity that i like yet you can set up you alarm clock extreme to be as compex as you want, you can even tell it to play pandora instead of it ringing
B00005JMXX|4.0|It makes no sense to worry over the niceties of plot or character; this is a big storm picture and on that score the creators did a fine job. The scenic design is excellent, the action is exciting, the actors suitably heroic, there are some barking dogs for the dog people and a pack of wolves in the heart of NYC to remind people that Wall Street will survive any crisis. There is even a bit of political correctness to remind the audience of which Party they should have voted for to avoid all these trouble (though. since there the message is covert. nobody should get steamed up. I enjoyed the surface, which was the heart of the piece, and pretty much ignored any clutter which got in the way. There is a good chance you will enjoy it, too; always provided that you resist searching for profundity.

B00B23O96A|1.0|I have been a fan of Eric Clapton for decades.  But his recent releases have continued to go downhill.  When I saw the song list, I was prepared for the worst - and regretfully it came.  This is an all-time low for Clapton.  Is his next CD going to be some duets with Michael Buble.  My first reaction was \\"does his record contract require something to be released so he just threw something together\\".  It sounds like he's just going through the motions.  Well, I've made a decision today.  No more purchases of CD's, DVD's or tickets to concerts.  If Eric doesn't care about his fans, I'm moving on.  I'll try to remember him by playing CD's from Cream, Derek and the Dominos, and solo ones up until Journeyman.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. But the way it ended leaves me with so many unanswered questions that I can't wait to open the next book. Not recommended for younger readers.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|I gave it 4 stars just because it is Bon Jovi, but it is not the Bon Jovi of old.  I realize that a 50+ year old man will not sound the same as he did in his 20's, but this CD is missing something.  Oh, the songs are pretty good and Jon Bon Jovi always sounds good, but the songs are too slow, mellow and lack that kick and that Bon Jovi edge.  The two best songs are Because We Can, and the love song, \\"Amen.\\"  However, they are no \\"You Give Love a Bad Name\\" or \\"Livin' on a Prayer.\\"  I will continue to listen and I can't help it, but I'll continue to buy Bon Jovi CD's because I'll always be a fan.  But, sad to say, this just isn't his best.

B003DXSXCI|5.0|Movie starts out a little slow but was well put together and nobody has a cell phone, has to use a pay phone, anyone younger than twenty years old may be confused.  Anyone who loves vintage muscle cars and four speed transmixer attached to a 1968 Ford Mustang GT and a Dodge Charger will like the chase.  Did I mention no cell phones.  Steve McQueen is the boss.

0375869026|5.0|I LOVE this book & have recommended it to my kids' teachers.  I read it to my kids (9yo & 8yo daughter, 6yo son) at bedtime, & we all loved it.  The book appeals to the kids because the characters think & speak like kids, & it has a lot of school & family issues that they can relate to.  At the same time, the main character August, who suffers from severe facial deformities, goes through intense social issues that most kids don't experience.  That gave us a lot to discuss in terms of people who are different, what they might feel when they're treated differently, discrimination, etc..  August just wants to be seen & treated like every other kid.  As a parent the book is a tearjerker in spots, but it's not written to be one....it just is.  Very realistic & relatable & made an impression on us all.

B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I finished watching all season 1 in 2 days. It is the most entertaining show I have seen in years. House of Cards exceeds at what the show \\"Scandle\\" wish it could be. A dark yet possibly realistic interpretation of the state of politics today. It's hard to cheer for Frank (Spacey) but you can't help but like the guy, you hope to see his lying and scheming pays off. I can't think of anyone who could pull off the roles of Frank and Clair and do better, they are perfect, the roles are casted perfect, the sound is perfect, the visuals perfect, the pacing perfect.  CAN'T WAIT FOR SEASON 2! Oh yea the Time Lapse Titles are a nice touch.

0385536828|4.0|Having read Chesil Beach a few months ago, I half expected this book to be similar. It was, and it wasn't. Both involve a young woman and her love life, but that's where the similarity ends. In Sweet Tooth, Serena  is an intelligent, beautiful person who, largely because of a romantic relationship with an older man, becomes involved in M15, an intelligence agency. Although her older lover deserts her, Serena learns the reasons behind his disappearance after she's become in Sweet Tooth, a covert operation funding writers with an anti-communist leaning.<br /><br />Since I listened to the book on CD, my take on it is probably different than if I had actually read the words and experienced the story that way. Listening allowed me to hear the delightful British accent, but at the same time, I could never get a good sense of Serena's character. I couldn't \\"see\\" her and predict her behavior. Was she sincere?  Was she scheming? Was she promiscuous? She slept with all the men in her life (except for Max) shortly after meeting them and was quite descriptive about her experiences. Is that typical behavior for someone of her background in the 1970's, the daughter of a Bishop?<br /><br />Love, lust, intrigue, espionage, trust, betrayal, complex relationships, and politics are a few of the themes explored In Sweet Tooth, a book well worth reading. I found myself wondering if anyone could be trusted and if everyone had an ulterior motive in befriending Serena. What about Shirley? Was she really a friend? Could she be trusted? Although I zoned out on some of the espionage conversations and M-15 meeting dialogue, some readers might those topics informative and quite interesting. What I did enjoy were the frequent references to literature.<br /><br />I noticed that some reviewers disliked the ending, but to me that was one of the most suspenseful parts of the book. Yes, world politics are important and affect all of us in ways that we're not even aware of. And yet, the human heart affects us even more. What will become of Healy and Serena?  With all the other twists and turns, what should one expect?fects us even more. What will become of Healy and Serena?  With all the other twists and turns, what should one expect?
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I tried the demo version of this game on my daughter's IPod and became hopelessly addicted.  My husband did the same thing, so she got it on her Kindle Fire HD.  We adore this game!  You have to match the colored dots to each other, using all the spots on the screen but also without crossing colors.  It gets harder as you go along and there was one level I never did figure out.  You can 'reset' the game and the goal is to get it solved in the fewest moves possible.  The best is to do one move per color, attaching the dots.  But you can keep practicing until you figure it out and then get a higher score for the fewer moves.  The trick is remembering how you did it!  It's really addicting, need I say any more??
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I do love almost anything by Sade.  When I purchased this album, I realized she has a softer, more subdued side.  I enjoy listening to this album when I want to relax or just have music playing in the background.  I will always appreciate and treasure the musical works of Sade!
B007SGM084|2.0|I'm not into S/M but I had to read it to see what all the hype was about.<br />The book seemed very unrealistic to me and lost my full attention pretty quick. I finished it solely because I hate leaving a book unread.<br /><br />The hype must've been that all the little &#34;desperate housewives&#34; who live such sane and safe lives need a little adventure in their day dreams so they thought they'd try and read some hardcore BDSM. To each their own but I personally think this is a little &#34;f*%&ed&#34; up. But, I am a strong willed and minded individual. If you're a weaker sort of person, you might get what the book's about and relate to it in a good way. I say, don't dis it til you read it.<br />I'm not dissin' it hard, I'm just saying it kind of disgusts me because it's just not my cup a'tea.
B000051VWW|5.0|I realized this was an album by Sade that I had yet to purchase.  At a happy hour late one afternoon, I played &#34;By Your Side&#34; on the iTunes jukebox, and decided to purchase this album right away!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I just wanted to say that I am not really into near death experiences (NDE), but I saw the author's interview on The Tom Sullivan Show one Sunday night and he was talking about the book and it intrigued me so I downloaded it and was very pleased with the book as a whole.  I do believe in the afterlife and I was comforted to know that there really is a place out there after we die.  What makes this story different from the rest is the fact that it wasn't just the trip down the tunnel into a white light.  It was a lot more and in pretty vivid detail.  The book does leave you on the edge as you're reading it so the author pulls you in and you can't get out until the book is finished.  I think you'll really like this book.<br /><br />I've seen shows on religious channels about NDEs and they are all the same and make you want to not believe because they are all basically the same, but this book is different in a lot ways.  Download the free sample and you too will drawn into the book and you'll have to buy it as well.  5 stars Mr. Alexander.

B009KS4XRO|3.0|I am only giving this game three starts cause I have been with it since inception. It started out really clitchy. Horribly so, that being said it is no longer full of said cliches, just horrible standards and rewards. You rarely get a bingo. When you do it is even more rare to get the collections items. The game requires an army of friends to get very far. It is a Facebook game. And because coins are involved some things either take forever to earn or cost cash. Other than that it is an okay game.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I love this series, and thankfully they have included a list of characters.  I read the books, (a must for completely understanding the intricate plot and getting the most out of the series), and can't wait for the next book to come out.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|No seriously if you looking a few minutes this game is great. In real life I have found this machine an incredible waste of money and time. Well these days most people of tons of time and fewer funds. I like trying to get the gifts and larger coins.

0446547573|5.0|I just don't know what to say. Nicholas Sparks does it again, with Safe Haven. He reeled me in, got my heart all wrapped up in the lives of his characters and ripped it apart. I don't read many of his books successively because of that. I can only read one every so often. Right now, my heart is broken; I mourn the loss of a character that never was. The plot was very intricate, and was driven solely by conflict. From the moment we meet Katie, we are faced with one of the biggest conflicts of the story. They were intricately woven throughout, and I was so immersed in this little town in North Carolina, that I forgot to remember it was a book. I too forged a friendship with Jo, I too cheered Katie on as she fought with her inner demons. Like Jo, I watched her fall in love with Alex, I watched them on the beach, I watched them hold each other, I watched them both come to life again as their relationship developed.<br /><br />I loved watching Katie's character evolve. The way the backstory was woven in was somewhat subtle, but necessary to developing a true understanding of what was going on. When reading these moment, we got the chance to get into the head of the villain, which was a necessary evil. Without understanding him, a reader would never have truly gotten to know Katie or Alex for that matter. He was the polar opposite of everything Kevin stood for. When I got to the point when I realised something significant about Jo's character, I wondered, like Katie, was any of it was real? Was she dreaming? Was she having some sort of psychotic episode or break? My heart stopped, but that unopened letter made me continue on. It made me believe in the possibility that Katie was living and breathing her experiences. Well done, Mr. Sparks! Stop by my blog for a more in depth review: [...]

B007MB5OCE|5.0|The funniest book ever. Crazy characters, whacked situations, strange action, elephants. I giggled while I read it, almost like watching the 3 stopped. Wasn't crazy about the ending, but who cares..
B002MCYWHG|5.0|I absolutely love this child carrier. My grandbaby rides right in front of me and I can keep an eye on him at all times. He can also look back up at me.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! It reached me on so many levels. I can relate to the main characters struggle with reality in his day to day life as he tries to heal from such terrible tragedy in his past. We all go through this I think, in one way or another. It is nice to read a story about a man who loses everything and eventually finds his \\"normal\\" again. This story definitely touches on our human nature to find people who are like ourselves; who can relate to what we are struggling with, and out incessant need to do so.<br />Great read for anyone who has ever made a comeback, big or small in their life!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|More twists and turns thrown in this book. Still very suspenseful and keeps you reading! Ready for the next book!!

B008TRUDAS|5.0|Probably the most depressing boom I've ever read in my entire life. I laughed while I cried and cried while I laughed. I want to wrap my arms around my parents and let them know the love I have for them, and I want to meet the love of my life and know its us against the world. I still have tears in my eyes as I'm typing this... This book was enlightening, amazing, poetic, loving, depressing... Every stifle emotion you could honestly have. Amazing amazing amazing job mrs Hoover!!!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|I love this book.  Also love the BBC version of the movie.  You just can't beat finishing up a good read with watching a good movie of the book.
B00004YW6I|5.0|PJ Harvey is known for her unusual/avant garde approach to music. It can sometimes be borderline abrasive or not user-friendly. \\"Stories from the City\\" is one of her most accessible albums. The songwriting is more melodic and less distorted. Her voice is a lot more clean and beautiful too; she displays her range much more. Thom Yorke of Radiohead appears on a couple of the tracks and compliments them extremely well.<br />This still sounds like a PJ Harvey album but there is a noticeable change in the way she's feeling and her demeanor over-all.<br /><br />If you like the distorted and raw sound of her earlier albums, this may take some getting used to but it's well worth it.<br /><br />If you like great singer-songwriter female rock, then this is a no-brainer.<br /><br />If I had to grade this I'd give it an A.<br /><br />Buy.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|always have enjoyed their games and this one is just as great as any of their games that I've played. Never disappoints. Great graphcs and also a great storyline. Highly recommend this game.
1451620829|5.0|You wanted the best and you got the best! The hottest autobiography in the world: CRISS!!! Well, maybe I'm exaggerating, but if I live 100,000 years, I don't think I'll read a more exciting and candid R&R memoir. It is far and away the best of the ones written by the 3 Kiss members thus far (Paul, what are you waiting for?) and perhaps second only to Chris Lendt's Kiss and Sell as the \\"best Kiss book ever\\" (sorry Gordon Gebert, I loved Kiss and Tell, but I prefer more cerebral fodder--hey, that's why I'm a Kiss fan!). But on to the book. Peter Criss narrates his rough beginnings as a young Hooligan from Brooklyn, but quickly gets to the good stuff: his life as a musician, and as Kiss' definitive drummer. Certainly the Kiss years are the most exciting part of the story, and Peter dishes a lot of dirt and previously unknown facts about the members of Kiss. By the time Peter joined Kiss, he had Nothin' To Lose, as he had already been in many failed bands, and his Rock and Roll biological clock was ticking. But once he joins Kiss, things get Hotter than Hell pretty quickly for him and the boys with whom he'll be playing all night, much to the chagrin of his first wife Beth (Sorry! I mean Lydia, who gets revenge against the Two Timer with her own tell-all book later!). Life on the road is typical rock band stuff--a lot of Room Service, going All the Way with Ladies in Waiting, and drinking Cold Gin, among other chemical inducements (cocaine was Peter's main addiction). Unfortunately Peter's Strange Ways soon become a detriment to the teetotalers Gene and Paul (whom he lambastes with gusto throughout the book). By 1980, the whole Kiss thing is more or less dead, and Peter is quietly tossed from the group, though he gets 25% of the take for a few years, allowing him to live like a Parasite off his ex-bandmates' earnings. But soon the revamped Kiss's fortunes slow down to a drip during their rotating-lead-guitarist-period, and Peter has to get back to work, lest he fall Into the Void. His solo career stalls, however, as it usually does for most members of successful rock bands who try the solo route (he blames Gene and Paul for this, of course!). And his Dirty Livin' and Rock and Rolling all night soon take their toll. He gets remarried to another Hard Luck Woman, Debra, who is as big a cokehead as Peter, and their Great Expectations (and even greater sex) soon Peter out (ouch!), with our drummer ending up almost broke and alone, barely surviving the San Francisco earthquake of the 90s. Peter eventually hits Rock Bottom and ends up doing a stint in rehab, which he completes successfully, much to his credit. And in the tradition of Behind the Music, everything turns out OK in the end. The original Kiss lineup reunites for a few years, the Psycho Circus gets back on the road, Rocking in the USA (and worldwide), and although Peter is paid journeyman wages for the gig (and inevitably gets fired yet again), the revival gets him out of the financial hole. Soon it's Kissin' Time again, this time with Gigi, who becomes his third wife, and clearly the best of the lot (third is indeed the charm here!). Peter then scores a successful acting gig on Oz, and continues to produce solo material, and of course this book. His story is Larger Than Life, and much better written then the usual rock star auto-hagiographies--for example, Gene used his books mainly to self promote, and Ace seemed to remember very little about his Kiss years (Paul, come on, Man, we are waiting for your version of Rashomon!).  Having read almost everything by and about Kiss, there was little here to Shock Me (except for a couple of truly disgusting anecdotes about Gene's hygiene and sexual practices), but overall Mr. Criss deserves much credit for this opus. He is at times whiny and tends to externalize his problems, but he does speak candidly about his own flaws. Despite the animosity Peter holds toward his ex-bandmates (even Ace), all 4 band members and associates are presented in a balanced manner, warts and all, with good points as well as bad points--indeed, they seem Almost Human. Peter is a man of passion and conviction, and his book is worth a Deuce (or at least the $15.47 price offered on Amazon). Makeup to Breakup is a real Rocket Ride for the Kiss fan, a Black Diamond for sure. Shout it out loud!
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I started using Evernote last year, and was very happy with the service, but a few months back the app crashed, losing all data since the sync before. Uninstalled and re-installed several times but it continues to crash on a regular basis on the Kindle Fire. Web apps and iphone/ipad work ok -- but rarely synch without an elaborate process. Customer Service is an oxymoron... Wish I wasn't so invested in the platform or I would ditch it completely. Be cautious with your data.

B00BNYCFNM|5.0|If you've never given Big Big Train a listen, you are missing out on an incredible experience. This is not your average progressive symphonic type band....their composition skills are exquisite.....some say they remind them of early Genesis and I can see that. the vocals are reminiscent of a young Phil Collins and they have a certain Canterbury musical quality to them....but everything fits into place so well.....nothing is either overdone or underdone - every note is where it should be..no space filling 'noodling' that seems prevalent on other progressive band cds. They deserve to be included in any discussion about the best progressive rock bands of all time....an amazing band. This is simply one of their best cds to date.....and every one has been wonderful. Not a single bad song on this. Treat yourself...put this on where you won't be disturbed, turn down the lights a bit, sit back and let the beauty wash over you.....this is music you experience
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|Of all the Marvel superhero comics I was into as a kid, I thought Captain America would be the most difficult to translate into a movie for today.  A guy who dresses like the American flag?  How could that not be unbearably corny?  But these guys have pulled it off.  The device they came up with to explain the star-spangled &#34;Captain America&#34; character was, to my mind, ingenious.  I won't spoil it for you by describing it here.  Let's just say that they took on a very challenging task and succeeded.  Yes, it's a comic-book movie, but it's a well-done comic-book movie and that's what it's supposed to be.  The writing, direction, and cast were all first-rate.

0060574216|5.0|I got married in 1981.  If I read this book when it was published in 1992, it probably would have prevented alot of arguments and ill feelings between my husband and myself.  It took me 20 years before I bought this book from a used bookstore because I was turned off by the title.  Maybe if it was titled, \\"Men are from Pluto Women are from the Moon\\", I would have read it sooner.  My hangup was because according to the astrological calendar, Mars is my planet, and according to the scientific literature, Venus is full of poisonous gases!<br /><br />Putting the title aside, I found myself laughing out loud several times, when the author seemed to be quoting my husband or myself!  While I don't agree 100 percent with his generalizations (I have cave dweller tendencies, and I still have to ponder over his wave analogy), and don't care for the amount of time he spends putting responsibility for one's behavior on one's upbringing, I can clearly relate to the differences between Martian and Venusian languages. And, his explanations for miscommunications make perfect sense.<br /><br />Throughout our marriage, my husband and I would repeatedly become frustrated, and over time, became frustrated with our repeated frustrations!  It's a vicious cycle.  We know that to love is to forgive and accept each other.  But this book provides the key to removing the frustration from miscommunication, so that we don't have to forgive as much and it's alot easier to accept each other!<br /><br />I really liked the author's simple suggestions on how to speak Martian and Venusian.  It really doesn't take that much effort.  I do regret is not reading this book sooner.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This book just seemed really dead. Ever since reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking about how dumb the whole idea was. At the beginning , we're told that no one has a reason not to be in trouble with the law,so why are Katniss and Gale the only ones behind that fence? If everyone is starving, they should give up mining and go hunt for Pete's sake.<br />Also, the author keeps repeating \\"flashback stories.\\" They made the book flow a lot more slowly. A word of advice to authors everywhere: don't keep repeating flashbacks unless it's critical to the story, and even then, don't create too many.Too many can get confusing.<br />A nobody even considers revolting?!What's the point of a story if not even the hero fights back? Those are the stories I would avoid.<br /><br />However, it did make me cry in some parts, so I guess the author did a somewhat good job. I just didn't see what the fuss was all about. The sentences seemed all out of place sometimes, though.  There are better books out there. Go read Harry Potter (at least the first few books.) Go read Deltora Quest (even though the Old English feel drove me nuts.)Heck, go read the Emerald Atlas! (Not as popular,but still better.) Just stop cramming this into my face.Please.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|easy to follow..good search and finds..not too easy..I really enjoyed it..not very long though..could be longer. I like these kinds of games. good story line
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is by far the best slender game I've ever played. This is also, I must admit, the scariest. When I saw slender crawling down the hill toward me I freaked out. This is as terrifying as fudge and well worth getting!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|\\"When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past. Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plainspoken single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.<br /><br />But even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her . . . a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport. With Jo's empathic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards . . . and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.\\"  ([nicholas sparks dot com])<br /><br />From the very first moment that I began reading this book I could not put it down.  I really appreciate the way Mr. Sparks simplifies his characters without putting too much into their emotions.  He lets his readers embrace what his characters are feeling without forcing their emotions onto us.  This author really has a knack for stripping his characters' souls bare and giving them the finest qualities, while still keeping them human; faults and all.<br /><br />If you ever want a well-rounded book, that is not rushed, has a beginning, middle and end that is not two days of seriously unbelievable action packed...then this is definitely the book for you.<br /><br />If you love this book....then you will like all his other books.  This man is the greatest thing since sliced bread!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I was not expecting to like this movie.  I had not read about it, and didn't like the title.  I was cajoled into watching it by my family and am very glad that I was.  Very funny, very different, and very worth watching more than once.
B00B23O96A|4.0|If you are a Clapton fan, you look forward to new stuff from him - this album doesn't disappoint! So Eric took a bunch af songs he likes and put his spin on them. Ok - his version and his touch to most songs is good news to me and I am generally pleased. Steve Winwood playing Hammond Organ, McCartney playing along, not bad! For a guy that in all rights should be dead, to hear his young children chime in on a song is a nice gesture and I'm sure was fun for Eric! A tribute to Gary Moore, nice! So let's take it for what it is, a music guy playing his version of standard tunes that he likes! Hey, it's not Derek & The Dominoes - so 4 stars, otherwise no problem. Listened to the downloaded version given as part of the Limited Deluxe Edition, on its way in the mail. Rock On Slowhand!
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Well done, intelligent show.  The interaction of the characters is quite good and the plot itself interesting.  Only negative is he speaks with such a thick Brit accent and so fast, I miss some of what he says and am wishing for subtitles.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Lets get this straight this app does NOT add battery power to your kindle it just montitors the battery level
B004SBQGHS|4.0|has more playing games  it has more levels to play and they get more exciting the sounds are more exciting
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Simply amazing.  I have previously gamed with the microsoft intellimouse explorer, and found it to have the best comfort of all the other mice that I had tried.  This mouse feels quite similar, though with the extra functionality befitting a gaming mouse.  I was able to grip the same way that I had with the intellimouse, but I now have 4 additional buttons as well as the ability to key in specific macros.  I play swtor primarily, so this mouse will be perfect for any mmo of that type.  I changed the customizable mouse buttons to specific keys, while leaving the foremost left button as my new alt modifier.  With this alt modifier now in use I have effectively upped the number of keybinds I use by 25%.  This mouse is pretty too.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I found that I cannot put this book down, it's salt and pepper.it's gripping and devastating all at the same time.

B005HP2JAM|2.0|I'm less inclined to comment on the content of Herzog's documentary.  I'm generally a fan of what he does, and I think this film, like his others, does a good job of presenting its subject in a way that is honest and straightforward, but with with an artfully constructed narrative.<br /><br />What I do feel inclined to comment on was the 3D cinematography.  I am absolutely a fan of 3D cinema, especially when it's used for a good cause.  In so many ways, this was a perfect concept for a 3D film, and at certain moments I was extremely appreciative that the film was shot in 3D, as you can really experience the shape of the cave for yourself, and see details you would otherwise miss.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the depth composition in the shots is all over the map.  I have a home projector, so I was watching on about a 100\\" screen.  Some of the shots were pretty unwatchable due to divergence of the far plane (when the two images at the farthest depth are farther apart than a set of human eyes).  There were also quite a few shots that had been very VERY badly converted from 2D.  If you closed your left eye, you could see where the right eye's image had halos of material sliding around with foreground objects.  I have absolutely no problem with stereoscopic conversion, but it must be done right.  I'm curious which company did the work on this film, as it was nothing like the high end work I've come to expect from StereoD or Legend3D.  Just absolute garbage that really doesn't do the film justice.<br /><br />Many shots throughout the film were shot with too much depth.  It seems as if when they shot it they were setting the inter-axial distance (distance between cameras, which determines the amount of depth in the shot) based on their on set monitors (which may have been extremely small, since they were bringing them into a cave).  Unfortunately, as you show content on bigger and bigger screens, the far depths start to pull your eyes farther and farther apart until they bleed.  Such was the case with Cave of Forgotten Dreams.<br /><br />I really hate to rag on a documentary for having poor stereoscopic cinematography, as I know it's extremely expensive and time-consuming to do well, and they obviously just didn't have the money to do it properly.  Despite that, I will say that I STILL found the 3D viewing experience more engaging than the 2D one.  I think that's a testimony to how good of an idea it was to do this film in 3D.  It's just too bad it didn't turn out better.  The good news is that they could probably go back and reconvert a lot of these shots.  The ones with leafy foliage would be a little tough, but the caves are relatively straightforward.  I'd be surprised if they actually did this, but who knows?  I still can't believe those loose mattes...  How did that get through QC?
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I live Bingo Blitz! I have downloaded many bingo apps from Amazon to play on my son's NabiTablet and downloaded from Google Play to play on my phone and Bingo Blitz is my favorite by far! And I've never experienced any problms with the app on either device. Coolest graphics, free daily tournament rounds, chat, send and receive collection items from friends on facebook and/or make new friends while in the game. Just love it everything about it! Great job Buffalo Studios! Keep up the awesome work!
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Before the aptly named Silk Degrees, Boz recorded R&B for Atlantic Records. You know... the Atlantic Records that broke Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin.<br /><br />Timing is everything and that time wasn't for Boz. But after Average White Band and Hall and Oates, the world was ready for the LA session version of Boz's blue-eyed soul.<br /><br />Boz stayed in that bag for awhile. My first hearing of him go back towards his roots was his performance of \\"Drowning in a Sea of Love\\" for Donald Fagen's New York Rock and Soul Review album. Killer track and much less Hollywood, but New York funk from Fagen is not exactly \\"roots.\\"<br /><br />Memphis, on the other hand, does get back to where Boz once belonged. Spot on imitation of the Willie Mitchell/Al Green sound on several tracks. Like \\"Silk Degrees,\\" Boz has recruited the Marvel Avengers for a backing band: on drums, Steve Jordan (Blues Brothers, Keith Richards' Expensive Winos), guitar, Ray Parker Jr (theme from Ghostbusters, Stevie Wonder, Herbie Hancock) and on bass Willie Weeks (Donny Hathaway, George Harrison, Randy Newman.)<br /><br />Could this be a 5 star album? Maybe. But is it better than Al Green's \\"Let's Stay Together?\\" or Boz's own \\"Silk Degrees\\" which are, for me clearly 5 star collections?<br /><br />I'll stick with 4 stars. Better that you think I'm cheap with stars then you be disappointed 'cause to much hype.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Great read couldn't put it down. Many very interesting twists. Unbelievable events but very well written. Need a part 2!
B001GLX74I|3.0|I would give a three and a half. There was some good aspects to this and some not so good. The battles were very good and liked the music and sound. The character animation was a little stiff. It was worth 4 dollars to give this a shot. If you want to use this movie to gauge the TV series, don't, the show does improve from  half way through the first season and beyond.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Interesting story but I felt there was far too much needless staging and it took FOREVER to get to the good stuff. After 50 pages or so, I became flat out tired of the excessive doses of John Corey wisecracks.  A character could not say or do anything without a silent or spoken Corey wisecrack. I am betting 50% of the print in this book is his wisecracks.<br /><br />If you can stand all of the sarcasm and witticisms, this can be a good read. The plot is interesting and the written tour of Yemen is very interesting.
B00BKW8UA4|5.0|Hands down, this is their best album yet. I have been a big fan of the band since Puzzle came out, and was anxiously awaiting this album.<br /><br />It tends to be a bit more straight-forward than their previous albums which jumped around quite a bit. For many bands that might be a bad thing, and could come off as \\"one-note\\", but as good as each song is on the album, it never comes across that way.<br /><br />Every other one of their albums have had one or two songs I was less a fan of, but this album is a constant stream of awesome.<br /><br />I don't write these reviews often, but anything I can do to spread the word about these guys in the US, the more likely they will be to tour more on this side of the pond.<br /><br />Cheers, and happy listening!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />Length:  1 hour, 58 minutes<br />Aspect Ratio:  2.35:1, or 2.40:1 (it is difficult to tell the difference)<br />Audio:  DTS HD Master Audio 7.1.<br /><br />The video quality was fantastic.  I do not currently have a 3D TV.<br /><br />The 7.1 sound was also fantastic - lots of sound to all the speakers, almost too much bass at times channeled to the sub-woofers (the room shook).  I could tell the difference between sound on the side surround speakers, and the rear surrounds, which I don't always notice on 7.1 movies.<br /><br />The movie was pretty good, not great.  But the audio/video quality makes it worth watching.  I can't wait to get a 3D TV.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The movie will be about Enders Game and Enders Shadow.  I read all the books in the series at the same time as my children read them.  They are both good fodder for family discussions.  Card created ethical dilemmas that can be pored over and either reviled or praised.  Which would you choose?  Put yourself in Ender's or Bean's predicaments and think about how you would choose to react.  This is really good stuff.  The difference between a child's view and an adult's view may be the approach to learning to use computers.  Children just type away, unafraid of failure.  Adults cautiously finger the keyboard hoping they don't screw up the software.  Then read \\"Speaker For The Dead\\".  The adult Ender faced with different sets of ethical dilemmas.  Card is a good teach.  Maybe not teacher, but guide.  I've read Enders Game, Speaker For The Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind,and Ender's Shadow.  In that order.  Liked them enough to reread them.  The audiobook of Ender's Game has the author describing in great detail the origins of the books.
B00A9T1HUO|4.0|Love Josh Groban....have almost all his CDs.  This one is worth the money and you won't regret paying for it....it's just not, in my humble opinion,  his greatest work.  Still enjoyable to listen to and worth buying though.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|its a rather fun game. my only issue it the controls, but considering all they have to work with is a touch screen. I think they did the best they could. just can be annoying at times when it doesn't register your move.
B00505470O|4.0|very chilled out mellow album, good for afterhours chillage, only 10 songs on the album I think, could have been abit longer but still a good album, I recommend buying it.
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|This is a great couple of hours of movie magic.  A little known, fascinating slice of American history (even though it's distorted almost to the point of being totally fiction).  Some quirky flash backs to the down and out Hollywood of the '70s (I was there: this is perfect!  Just to see the \\"Burbank Studios\\" logo on the Warner Brothers water tower was a brilliant piece of time travel.  And what about those scenes at Zsa Zsa's house!  It's like Hal Ashby and Sydney Pollock meet the Coen Brothers-- and it works.  (Alan Arkin deserved the Oscar more than did the film itself.)  Of course the climactic airport scene with its 1940s South Asian goons chasing our Yankee heroes is vomit-worthy (not to mention one of the worst examples of jingoism since Kermit Roosevelt toppled the Mossedeq regime!)  But who cares when we're pulling out of Afghanistan having saved the Hindu Kush for the gipper and want to pretend that our foreign policy of the past 60 years hasn't really been any worse than...say...that of Genghis Khan.<br /><br />A great film?  Hardly.  A great film is \\"Pather Panchali (the greatest perhaps),\\"  \\"Vertigo,\\"  \\"Rules of the Game,\\"  \\"Divorce Italian Style,\\"  \\"Stagecoach,\\"  \\"2001,\\"  \\"Walkabout,\\"  \\"Nights of Cabiria,\\"  \\"Persona,\\"  \\"Notorious,\\"  \\"His Girl Friday,\\"  \\"Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,\\"  \\"Ran,\\"  \\"On the Waterfront,\\"  \\"Empire Strikes Back,\\"  \\"Apocalypse Now,\\"  \\"Murmur of the Heart\\"  or David Lean's \\"Great Expectations.\\"  Last year, \\"Lincoln,\\" \\"Life of Pi\\" and \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" were all far more courageous, honest, and original.  This is clever,  fast,  and fun Hollywood junk for smart people addicted to the fast food media hookup machine.  You could do worse.
B0091WUZJE|4.0|I've seen this film a number of times. This most recent viewing was on HD. The cinematography in HD is so superior to any of the previous formats, (TV broadcast), VHS, DVD, it's almost like a new picture. The location and the production design, very good to begin with, are spectacular in HD, even breathtaking. Overall the film is entertaining, provided you are not weary of its many weaknesses: Jeffrey Hunter and Vera Miles are way too old to play the lovestruck teens. Ford's comic relief scenes in general have not aged well. And the casting of the Comanches was a joke. If you can get past all of that, there is still plenty of Alan LaMay's original story remaining to make for some better than average entertainment.
0375869026|5.0|Books like this one remind me why I love children's literature that much. Heart-warming story, honest, with the potential to touch the hearts of many many more readers. I truly enjoyed it.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This isn't serious humor folks....it's silliness, slapstick, ridiculous fun time.  Only criticism is that there are times when they, especially John Cleese, yells too much....starts getting on your nerves.  Lot's of fun though.
B005LAIHXQ|4.0|i liked itbut,to much death,it didn't answer the question and leaves  a hope there will be another.if not then what?t v has done it so many times and it's hard to get involed in something with out a good answer
B00BM9WM2C|5.0|I hear people complaining a lot about this album, but I personally find it perfectly entertaining. No, it may not have the original Bon Jovi rock roots, but it has the same soul and brotherhood every album they put out always has. I think everyone should give this at LEAST 4 stars. Why? BECAUSE WE CAN!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|Good story, great characters,the story flows very smoothly. It was a very interesting read - didn't want to put it down.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|I didn't read this book so I can't say if the book made sense and the producers of this movie just blew, or not. Tommy Lee Jones did his usual good job playing, in this case, a variation on his sheriff-character in the movie, NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN. But the script didn't really back him up. In the end it was a bit of a muddle. For all that, if you're in the mood to watch a film and there is nothing else available, &#34;it's okay&#34; which is Amazon's 3-star rating. In a conventional rating system, I'd give it 2 1/2 stars and only because of Jones and Steenburgen, who did a credible job as his wife.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Took me awhile to get into it but all round, a great storyline set in pre-war England.  Will buy the next season when its out
1452110581|3.0|There is some cute stuff in here but overall my family (who are all serious cat people) rated it at So So.  We didn't even keep the book, we donated it to our library.  I'd recommend getting the book from the library or looking at it in a bookstore before you spend the money to buy it.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|one of the best murder mysteries i've read. i'd never read a joe nesbo novel before, and i am already looking for the next one.
B007BO4DQU|5.0|i love twilight, the lead actress needs some serious acting lesson's, that's my only complaint, if any ? the girl can not act?
B000RZIGVS|5.0|I have seen every episode and move ever made except Enterprise, which I can't stand.  Can't wait for the new movie and an improved MMORPG game.  And for the love of God we need another series.  I mean come on, why???
B001XUJMZK|4.0|If you can get past an aging Mel Gibson playing a young man, you will probably like this film as much as most people have.
B001B6M0F0|5.0|Had this double-live album as a kid in 80's and always enjoyed listening to it. I hadn't heard it for about 20 years, but when I saw the mp3 download for $6.99 I thought I'd try it out. The sound quality is great and they added 2 extra live songs to the original album which is nice. I'm more impressed with Michael Schenker' s guitar now then I was as a kid. I hope another generation enjoys UFO as much as we did in the late 70's and early 80's.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|My grandkids and I loved playing this game.  Now not so much.  This latest update had made some changes.  It takes forever to collect the coins and experience.  Today  was collecting and was checking out how long it would take for my expansion and wow - it took my acorns to expand - had one hour to wait - as if I would spend acorns to expand! GRRRRRR was saving for animals but no such luck - now don't play as often.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Very academic at times but great read and excellent insight. Author has done his homework and changes the way you think about modern culture
B001ED7C58|5.0|i bought the soundtrack, however was disappointed the clare de'lune was not on there however it's still good music no matter what
B00B23O96A|1.0|As a long time clapton fan,like all others the news of a new album is met with great anticipation.<br />I was not looking for vintage clapton but at least songs that showed some heart and soul.<br />Theres maybe two tracks that come close but really, a reggae version of further on down the road??<br />Plus he starts to go into the rod stewart classic song book mode which for me is the signal<br />its time to call it a day or at least to stop putting out cds.<br />For my money try Eric Burdens latest. Erics voice is not what it used to be but<br />there still is the heart and soul sound, plus the arrangements and muscianship are<br />great. The same unfortunately cannot be said for clapton.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|This a more a kids' movie than an adult movie, but the animation is something to behold. At times one wonders if the scene one is seeing is truly animation or live-action; it's that good. I believe that Tintin might actually be giving us a view of the future of motion pictures, a time when it's too expensive to shoot live action with real human beings, so everything is rendered by computer; and we only know real actors by their voices, or perhaps the visages that they lend animated characters in return for a royalty.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I can't be enthusiastic enough about how much I love this series. I love the two DVD format, the extras and the lovely job they did at restoring the picture. This version actually looks much better than my friends special edition version. I highly recommend this, especially at this price.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|It was an okay read. I felt like the main character's attitude toward giving up a relationship with his son was very weak and unforgiveable. Okay to read one time, but I would never reread this or even recommend it to someone else.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This is another Disney movie to add to the collection. I thought it was very well written that is easy to relate to for both parents and children. I was skeptical about renting it but now regret not buying it. Idea for Amazon to make money is to allow people to rent a movie digitally then if they want to purchase the digital copy let the customer pay the difference. I would definitely be more apt to purchase the movie!
B00003CXXS|5.0|spooky, scary, just like i was there, couldn't believe how scared i was, wonderful that a movie can make you feel that way
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|Loved the unexpected surprises! Nicely done. I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend it to anyone interested.
B008Y73940|4.0|Just about everything Michael Connelly put in the novel is on the screen for better or worse. This is a story with a twist. In my opinion, the twist works better in the book than in the movie. In the latter, I feel credulity was strained. For all that, I liked the movie better than Amazon's \\" it's okay\\" which is their 3-star rating. So I gave it four. In a conventional rating system I would rate this a 3 out of 5 stars.
B00BSJ8TX2|2.0|I am finally moving on. I wanted this to be really great, but very disappointing. Too much violence, over and over again. Most is predictable and stupid. I sure like Kevin Bacon, but not in this one. The writing is bad. I like cult stories, but this one is silly. Oh, well there are still good series to watch. Most of them are European though. Try the English, Swedish and Danish crime dramas. Class act writing, acting and directing.
B00B23O96A|2.0|after his last ho hum effort I didn't think he could do much worse, But he did, except for the sad cover of Still Got the Blues for Gary Moore which is passable at best, he really butchered this one up...in the old days of records this would be in the cut out bin & possible the day after release. If this is what he wants to do I would hope he would have the dignity to stop & just rest on the oldies...
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great story, but the many characters were overwhelming in the beginning. Thankfully Xray solved that problem. I don't think I could have gotten through it on paper.
B004LWZW8I|5.0|truly a must see movie and the story was excellent as well, henry cavill was wonderful loved it took me back in time
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This is a good book! I have read the book a lot ! I think you should read it!Have fun reading it
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I have listened to this Disc a few times in a row and I must say that it is a bold statement by someone who has something to say to the listener(not someone who has something to prove). There is an underlying angst(for lack of a better word) that weaves it self throughout the songs. David not only wants you to know something, he wants you to feel something. I like the disc though. New Cd's are like new roommates, you may love them initially but over time they may become \\"not so much\\". Some of the best CD's(in my opinion) are the ones that both made you think but returned to you as they seeped into your subconsciousness as you found yourself humming a melody from it when you least expect it or waking up with it stuck in your mind. I am not sure if this is going to happen with this CD, but I will give it a damn good chance to do so. I primarily listen to music through headphones(Great ones at that) connected to a decent music source. I want to hear everything the artist wanted me to hear so I will review it again in a few weeks, but for now, I will listen(and feel) the message and see what it does to me.<br /><br />OK,OK! Only after a few days with this disc and I LOVE IT! The disc has hiJacked my iTunes Library and all of my iPods. The music and lyrics are richly dense. Definitely a top 10 Deserted Island CD!
B00BFUC8RC|2.0|There's not very much you can do with this game. It's pretty basic, I think it would be a good game for a young child. I got bored with it really fast.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My husband and I loved this movie. It is funny, cute, sweet, and the storyline is fabulous. I will probably end up purchasing this DVD/blue day combo and giving my brother the DVD version because he loved video games and his son loves colorful movies. I recommend this movie to anyone!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Loved the movie  thought Denzel Washington played a great part. Story line true to life of a sitiuation that could happen a different slant on other flight movies. Very entertaining and story line kept you interested the entire length of movie. Highly recommend.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|i like the fact that this movie is a western with aliens....lol. why not? worse things could happen?....lol  right? so i bought it
B00B23O96A|5.0|Every record we get from Eric Clapton at this point in his life is a gift to us (this thought stated by another on-line reviewer).  I could not agree more.  This is Eric's first release on his own record label, allowing him freedom from record company constraints and demands.  I think the record is very good and as with his previous records, this one will hold up well when we look back on it years from now. \\"461 Ocean Boulevard\\" was treated similarly by fans and critics alike upon it's release in 1974 because it supposedly did not have the fire of the Cream and Derek and the Dominos records.  It is now regarded as one of Eric's finest. The highlights of \\"Old Sock\\" for me after only a couple of listens are the incredible reading of Gary Moore's Still Got The Blues, simply stunning, and Eric's vocals throughout the entire record, quite fine.  The fine guitar work is a given with Eric.  I also like the several reggae tracks, which harken back to the 1970s when Eric paid tribute on several records to the music of Jamaica.  Well done by a true master.  It has been a wonderful 50 years of Eric Clapton contributing to the soundtrack of many of our lives.
B003DCPGNS|5.0|All the rapid dialogue and comedic timing was amazing. I had never seen this movie before, and I thought it was hilarious.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|One of the two movies we play for family visiting at Christmas every year (Laurel and Hardy's March of the Wooden Soldiers is the other).  This movies shows the magic of Santa Claus, whether real or just due to the belief in him.  A little girl who was taught by her mother that 'fairy tales' are just that, and there is no Santa or Easter Bunny or Tooth Fairy, learns to believe in Santa after meeting him.  With the help of a neighbor, played by John Payne, the mother learns to believe too.<br />Lots of drama, humor, and tender scenes.  Will make you believe, too.
B00AYF5SRG|5.0|\\"Vivaldi Con Moto\\" is the latest Archiv Produktion recording from virtuoso violinist Giuliano Carmignola, the violin master of Baroque music and the perfectionist music of Antonio Vivaldi in particular. He is recorded playing inspired, beautiful versions of Vivaldi concertos which Carmignola ostensibly 'listens to' while driving his motorcycle across Italy. With excellent support from Accademia Bizantina under the baton of maestro Ottavio Dantone, Giuliano presents the glorious world premier of Concerto in F major, RV 283, and original manuscript interpretations of the Concerto in E minor RV 281 and the Concerto in C major RV 187 which shares musical commonality with the opera Griselda. In addition there are marvelous performances of Concerto in D major RV 232, Concerto in E flat major RV 254, and Concerto in D minor RV 243, composed 'sans' the E string (Some versions of this recording also have the Largo movement from Concerto in A major RV 350.) The Vivaldi treasure troves 'unearthed' from sources such as European monastery basements and ancient library boxes continue to yield fresh dazzling music for musicians such as Giuliano Carmignola and Accademia Bizantina by way of the composing genius of the Red Priest for the benefit of the music world. These are great performances from stem to stern. My Highest Recommendation. 5 MASTERFUL Stars! (18 tracks, ~70 minutes. Mr Carmignola plays a 1739 Florenus Guidantus violin.)

B00B23O96A|5.0|This is an album you have to listen to several times before you get it His version of the Ray Charles song \\"Born to lose\\" and the Huddy Ledbetter classic \\"Good Nite Irene\\". Still got the blues, is one of the finest blues songs of his career. This is probably his strongest effort since Journeyman . If it was nothing but blues, they would probably say he is in a rut. EC is revealing himself to us. He is singing music he enjoys. My advice is to get this CD and play it over and over. You will be glad you did. Over time this has become one of my favorite Eric Clapton albums
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to read. Easy to use! Great!  Easy to understand. Thank you for offering it. It's made calculating much easier. I guess I. 'm saying it's easier!

B00BLF9FOK|4.0|I am surprised that this movie didn't do better at the box office, but I think it was up against stiff competition at the time.  I think it was a really good movie and I sure wouldn't mind seeing it again and owning it.  Arnold's still got it!  A lot of good action with unlikely heroes....some incredible car chase scenes... good plot, and some good laughs, too.  I really wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did, but was pleasantly surprised!  Way to go, Arnold!!! Looking forward to your next project!

B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie was really fun - not sure if it derseves best picture but I liked it. I found myself more curious about the other hostages than the refugees who were the center of the movie. All in all it's a light movie, doesn't really tackle big issues and it has some funny parts but it's well worth it.

B005JABSB6|5.0|This was the Sharp recommendation for the Sharp Quatro 3D TV I purchased. The TV came with 2 model AN3DG20EL glasses for some reason, but these look to be almost identical. They charge up easily, from the TV or from my computer (where I can do 2 at a time) and seem to work identically with the ones that came with the TV. They fit comfortably over my glasses, and for the discount price I got here on Amazon, I am glad I skipped the &#34;lower cost&#34; off-brand clones.

B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Joaquin Phoenix stars as Freddie Quell who is a World War II vet who has served in the merchant navy too. Whilst on active duty he developed a penchant for making magic hooch type mixes to get through the stress and monotony of war. On his return Stateside it is clear that he has been traumatised by his experiences. He has to attend classes for what is now called `post traumatic stress disorder' or PTSD, and it is all a bit basic, so he leaves.<br /><br />After a succession of down at heel jobs and increasingly erratic behaviour, he stowaways on board the boat of charismatic cult leader, Philip Seymour-Hoffman playing Lancaster Dodd or `The Master'. He has some loyal followers who believe in his theories of time travel regress therapy. It is not long before Quell falls under the thrall of The Master, but as things develop so do the real basis for the relationship and all, as ever, is not what it seems.<br /><br />To say any more would indeed be a plot spoiler. This is essentially a character study of two people and the main leads both take their character studies to the enth degree making even Mr Day-Lewis seem a bit tardy by comparison when he wears his false beard. The central performances are quite rightly at the heart of this and it is their performances that make this so engrossing. It is also brilliantly framed in nigh on every shot, with use of interesting camera angles.<br /><br />Writer and director Paul Thomas-Anderson (`There Will Be Blood' and `Boogie Nights') has made a thought provoking and stylish study of the human spirit. This was Academy nominated, but got a no show. I was bemused by it at first as Quell was a bit unlikable and yet I wanted to see what happened to him. This is also a film about, essentially these two men and so is far from a rollicking adventure. The supporting cast are all top rate too and I could not spot a single dud performance, the attention to period detail is spot on and even at 2 hours and 24 minutes it held my attention through out. It will not be for everybody but I found it almost addictive and is one that kept my interest until the closing credits.rough out.

B009RI4FRU|3.0|This movie is really fun but a bit too stylized for my taste. The alternative style is a bit distracting at times but all in all it's funny and entertaining.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This tells the stories, first hand, of a true American hero, and what he did to protect his fellow Sailors, Soldiers, Marines, and Airmen. It is a travesty on how Chief Chris Kyle was savegely murdered, and I will never forget him or his contributions to the saving of American lives.

B0094K1WZE|4.0|An even faster than usual moving action flick than some of the earlier MI flicks with Tom Cruise, with some very interesting locations reminding me of the some of the Bond series. On the whole, I loved the stunt actions that were pushed to limits. In my case, as a hearing impaired using hearing aids  and therefore relying  somewhat on  the dialog through close captioning which is not available in &#34;instant viewing&#34;, I missed out on some dialog important to the plot.<br />As a general comment on the current MI series, I must say that the original TV series, although lacking the kind of action and computer animation possible in today's film making, relied more on refined deception of villains instead of spectacular action and therefore seemed more clever in concept. Solely my personal opinion...
B002ZG977Y|5.0|omg i loved this movie, sam worthington was so sexy and wonderful in this movie, i watch it all the time just so i can look at him!

B007MCTTHY|2.0|I was very interested in this game because it's a type of puzzle I enjoy. However the graphics are so low resolution the game looked &quot;blurry&quot; on my Kindle Fire and it gave me a headache after just a few levels. I ended up deciding to uninstall the game.
B00422LESO|4.0|I love Jane Austen, but what woman doesn't.<br />I really enjoyed the way this plot was set to go to a place that portrayed the the Jane's books.

B001BR5NN0|3.0|I am an 80's child and didn't see it when it came out (probably due to the &#34;R&#34; rating). I decided to &#34;catch up&#34; on this reportedly &#34;epic&#34; movie and I honestly don't know what all the hype is about. It does teach an important lesson (be a friend to all no matter who they are or what social class they have) but I didn't think it was as great as I've heard. Maybe I'm just behind the times....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wanted to read this before I saw the movie. I did and I loved it--I can't wait to see the movie. Martel does a nice job portraying Pi as a youth, genuinely interested in religion. Knowing this about Pi really influenced the way I read the rest of the story. Definitely a book to enjoy and make you feel lucky for all that you have!

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't wait to read the next one. I am such a hopeless romantic!!! I am so glad that I started this trilogy of books!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie had many elements of a great movie. A realistic backdrop, excellent directing, top knotch settings, but for some reason, it just didn't click. It is well-deserving of its oscar hype, but in my opinion, misses out the connecting the audience to the characters engrossed in this drama; which is perhaps the most important feature of movies such as this. I found myself more concerned with Iran, its people, and the cultural climate, than the well-being of the characters. Aflec looks determined, focused, but dispassionate and removed, which didn't help with &#34;feeling&#34; for the characters' plight.<br /><br />Its worth the watch, but will not stand out as a great movie.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was well written and a nice, quick read. John Green does a nice job portraying the characters with cancer--pretty realistic but not too medical or depressing that it is consistently engaging!
B007HOOAH6|5.0|I bought this for toilet training my three-year-old, and he LOVES the book.  He made me read it six times the first night.  Now he quotes it when I ask him about going potty on the potty (&#34;I could try!&#34;).  No real movement (pun intended) on the actual potty yet, but it's just a matter of time.  In the meanwhile, the book is cute and gets the conversation going.  Kindle formatting is perfect, no repeat pages or glitches.  The illustrations are easy to understand and the colors are vibrant.  My toddler gives it two thumbs up.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Fast, cool, and low power draw.  I have this in my htpc running off of a 400W PSU, no problems so far.  It barely fit into my Silverstone GD04 case because of the heatpipes being a bit high, but I can't fault the card for having a big cooler, that was a feature!  It is also practically silent at any reasonable load/fan profile.  Great card.

B006HL9G10|5.0|It is a great way to connect with others who are meditating. You can see everyone meditating with this app at any given time. There are groups you can join or create. After you finish meditating - an option comes up to journal or not. There is an option to connect with people who are meditating near you or across the world. I had only meditated twice and someone from thousands of miles away sent me a message: &#34;Thank you for meditating with me!&#34; A great positive reinforcer to help make meditation a part of your daily life. Completely worth the $2-

B006VFLIYK|3.0|Baldacci can write a tight, fast laced adventure. For a summer beach or a winter night, this tale gives a simple diversion. But the actions are direct, the plot a little(?) contrived. All the male heroes are disciplined, and the female stars are narrow-hipped. A writer of this talent can give a great tale with texture. I look forward to it.
B0034DGPEU|2.0|Murder, rape, incest, sororicide, polygamy, drug addiction, alcoholism, gambling addiction, arson, abuse, epidemics, mental insanity, dirty secrets, oh my!  This book contained page after page of nothing but drama.  No situation ever turned out good for anybody.  I feel like this book was written with a Lifetime movie in mind.  Personally, I don't need drama at every turn of the page to remain engaged.  It was just too much, and all the drama replaced pages that could have covered character development and filled gaping plot holes.  It was a page turner, but I literally cringed every time I turned the page, bracing myself for yet another horrific tragedy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the most fascinating reads I have ever done. A relative of mine was reading it and I thought I would give it a try.<br />I couldn't put it down. I read the entire trilogy in 4 days. It was an interesting, educational, and intriguing story full of every emotion imaginable. I intend to purchase the trilogy just to have it around. Thank you E.L.James.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Have had this a short time and so far I love it. Lots of room for my camera and accessories. Lots of pockets. They even have little tabs to cover the pocket zipper to keep it closed and make sure it doesn't scratch anything. The dividers are moveable to accommodate different size lenses, etc. There are two straps on the outside for your tripod, outside pockets too. Best of all the padding on this pack is ultra comfortable. I did a short hike this week with it to take photos of wild horses in the desert. It worked great. Very happy thus far, but haven't had it long enough to see how it wears.

B00BLDD3A4|5.0|Luckily, I found out about the \\"Sound City: Reel To Reel\\" through the Foo Fighters e-mail mailing list.  I decided to take a chance on them because I previously enjoyed the Foo Fighters greatest hits collection (reviewed it on January 14, 2011), their Wasting Light cd (reviewed on May 14, 2011), and had much fun at one of the Foo Fighters concerts back in November 11, 2011.  As with millions of others, I have been aware of Foo Fighters since the 1990's thanks to MTV.  Additionally, I have been familiar with the Foo Fighters and this genre of music because my two older brothers frequently listened to rock music. I like the diverse music collaborations on the cd.  I also completely understand that it is going to vary with each man or woman on personal favorites on this cd.  However, I have to admit that the following are among the songs that caught my attention: \\"Heaven And All\\" (Robert Levon Been, Dave Grohl, Peter Hayes), \\"You Can't Fix This\\" (Stevie Nicks, Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, & Rami Jaffee), \\"The Man That Never Was\\" (Rick Springfield,Dave Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel& Pete Smear), \\"From Can To Can't\\" (Corey Taylor, Dave Grohl, Rick Nielsen, & Scott Reeder), \\"Cut Me Some Slack\\" (Paul McCartney, Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, & Pat Smear), and \\"Mantra\\" (Dave Grohl, Joshua Homme, & Trent Reznor). \\"Sound City: Reel To Reel\\" is a great music choice for those who like rock music featuring an eclectic range of musicians.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|I like the zombie war from many perspectives. It was very good, but at times it was a hard read. There was certain characters I wish I knew more about and the narrations wearnt long enough. My favorite story was the girl whose life was saved by a mysterious voice on the radio.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|interesting story that we never knew as it was classified. great story and pace and convincing acting. easy watch, you won't notice the time. happy ending for those of you who like that.
B00BNPZAEM|5.0|\\"The Next Day\\" by David Bowie features songs that touch on a wide range of human conditions.  This cd has elements of new-wave, 80's rock, and modern rock combined in many of the songs. \\"Dancing Out In Space\\", \\"You Will Set The World On Fire\\", \\"Plan\\", and \\"I'll Take You There\\" are some of the multiple strong songs on \\"Next Day\\" that capture the panorama of life experiences. \\"The Next Day\\" by David Bowie would most likely resonate with those who are open to listening to music that carefully blends 80's romantic rock with modern day rock music elements.

B005KJ6ECY|5.0|lovvvvvvvvvvvve the The tudors one of the best series ive ever watched cnt get enough only wish they had made it longer.
0062014536|4.0|This book starts fairly quickly after the second book in the series, Pandemonium, ends. Waiting that year was so painful I actually re-read Pandemonium to get myself back to the right frame of mind to read this.<br /><br />Requiem, much like the two previous books, sucked me in right away to the point that I couldn't put the book down. Sleep and work became very hard while reading this. This book alternates points of view between Lena, our main heart of the story, and Hana, Lena's once BFF. Lena is back with the resistance and this time with Julian. She is having a hard time with finding out that Alex isn't dead, but very much alive. How Oliver handles the feelings between the three is very interesting to me. Julian is confused because everything he knows isn't `right' anymore. Alex is confused how Lena could fall in love with someone else and Lena is confused with how Alex is alive and she's now in love with Julian. I found the situation to be handled quite realistically for what could be considered realistic in a dystopian novel. I have read reviews where the reader was upset because one of the three didn't do the `obvious' choice. The obvious choices are often the most overlooked choices and while Oliver painted a heartbreaking portrayal of love, she also painted a relatable one.<br /><br />Lena is also fighting other forces in her life: her mother being alive, there being a traitor in her group and fighting their way back into the city.<br /><br />Hana's life is very different from Lena's. She is `happy.' She is living what many would consider to be a picture perfect happy life and is on her way to marriage. The closer she gets to marriage, though, the more Hana realizes not everything is perfect with her match, and maybe the cure didn't work the way it was supposed to.<br /><br />There is that pivotal perfect point where everything converges and the big BANG occurs and though it could be considered perfect timing (and it is), the book also ends very open-ended but with a strong message that was carried throughout the novel.<br /><br />Oh this book. This series has stolen my heart from the moment I started the first book, Delirium. This is one of those series I shouldn't have started until the last book came out. I've spent the past two years moaning about this book series to my friend and how it killed me when I read it. That being said, Requiem didn't let me down. At all. Even the stuff I didn't agree with didn't bother me because Oliver's writing is so strong and beautiful. If anything it protected me like a blanket when I wanted to cry.<br /><br />In my opinion, it is a beautiful ending to the series. Oliver could have taken it many different ways, and in a way, she did by having two different alternating narrators, but it still worked. If anything, Hana, who I spent most of the series ambivalent towards, I ended up liking because I got her side of the story, even if I didn't agree with everything that she did. That is how good Oliver's writing is, even when I disagreed with a character, I understood why she went there. Some moments it was uncomfortable and painful, but they were always needed.<br /><br />The end to this series isn't going to make everyone happy, and it was fairly open-ended to the point that I want to know more, but I'm still content with this being the last book. Which seems to be a rare thing from fellow reviewers, and I find hard to believe because I know I had high expectations from this story.<br /><br />Originally posted at yAdultReview.but with a strong message that was carried throughout the novel.<br /><br />Oh this book. This series has stolen my heart from the moment I started the first book, Delirium. This is one of those series I shouldn't have started until the last book came out. I've spent the past two years moaning about this book series to my friend and how it killed me when I read it. That being said, Requiem didn't let me down. At all. Even the stuff I didn't agree with didn't bother me because Oliver's writing is so strong and beautiful. If anything it protected me like a blanket when I wanted to cry.<br /><br />In my opinion, it is a beautiful ending to the series. Oliver could have taken it many different ways, and in a way, she did by having two different alternating narrators, but it still worked.

B00AB0AR2U|5.0|Great series I think this is the final chapter in this series. I will watch it again. way to go Milla
B001F4UHGC|5.0|It was great! Love Steve McQueen!! I'd recommend it to those who like old cars, fast driving and action. He's the best!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app displays all the important weather information that you need to know about a certain location at a glance, and you can drill down to more details if needed.  The graphics are very crisp although the video is grainy as it's being played in our Kindle Fire HD.  Very satisfied nevertheless.  Recommended, more so that it's free!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great game. I'm 56 &amp; I love it!  great graphics and music. I play on a Kindle Fire &amp; the tap screen controls work best for me. Give it a try. Fun for all ages.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|i love its tone! it just can wake me up, far better than general music. and the design of solving mathematics problem is awesome!
B006964E8S|5.0|Great characters, more twists and tuns than ...well... A really twisty turny thing. I really enjoyed this book from the start to the finish. I love a fallible but tough hero, and some really good guys doing the right thing whilst ignoring risk and danger. The &#34;reveal all&#34; at the end is neatly done and only partially satisfying creating interest in the sequel ( which I read first a think is a quarter star better than this ). Fine and entertaining and had me from about page 3. Doesn't get much better
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|I've been a fan of Hugh Jackman ever since I first saw X-men, so I saw the movie in theaters and loved it. I really enjoy buying the blue ray/dvd combo packs too, mostly because my sister's or parents can watch the DVD portion while I watched the blue ray on my PS3. The movie itself was pretty good and quite enjoyable if you like watching movies with father/son bonding.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|entertaining story and fun puzzles. only wished it lasted longer. like the was you are able to return to a previous locations to find additional items.
140591243X|4.0|I really enjoyed the story and excited for a 3rd book! Some parts of it dragged when he had to stay away from her but I was happy with the ending.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Again, PC appears to get caught up in the extreme technicalities of her M.E.-Ness!  She continues to \\"skirt\\" the personal lives of her main characters. Too much detail about the minutia of the case and and not enough Marino, Lucy or Benton!!
B00280LYHS|4.0|I love this book. After all of the Pery Jackson books this on  is my favorite. Hope you have a great tome reading it.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|My girlfriend bought this game to play 4 levels before it stopped working properly.  When she clicked the little cinema bubble to continue the story, the app closes.  Also you pay to buy the app and then it wants you to either pay more for \\"jedi training\\" or forces you to get 3 stars before continuing?  Rovio, you're getting too big for your britches.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I was hooked after the first book. Second was almost as good but this last one kind of lost my interest.
B000M341RI|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. I'm ashamed to say I only watched it for the first time this year, but am so pleased that I did. I especially love the &#34;fully exposed edition,&#34; which includes so many bonus features I was just having a field day! As far as the movie is concerned, what can I say? It's a great film. Each character has their own reason for taking part in this crazy idea, but Gaz's reason is the most heartfelt--he needs the money so he can keep seeing his kid. I was so happy that this wasn't just a &#34;stripper&#34; movie; it has its own realistic plot that I think anyone would enjoy. The film touches on all kinds of hardships (lack of work, low self esteem/insecurity, desperation), but also touches on the strong friendship that eventually builds between these different characters. Every actor in this film really hit it out of the park, most notably Robert Carlyle and Mark Addy. If you're looking for a touching yet hilarious film, look no further. You really feel for these characters and I definitely found myself cheering on with the audience at the end of the film.<br /><br />The special features are another big plus for this fully exposed edition. I love watching deleted scenes and how a film is made. There is definitely a lot of extra material in this edition! Well worth the money and the time.
0425263908|5.0|I found this after reading 50 shades. O.M.G. By far my favorite series ever!!! I love the relationship and the writing was really good. can't wait for EWY!!
B00628RVV0|4.0|As always the subject of the Holocaust, is heavy subject matter. This was told from the perspective of a young boy and wasn't as dark as it could have been.  It was a good story and it had a very shocking ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|What a great calculator. It's pretty simple and basic but that's just what I was looking for. It's easy to use and it's huge which makes it easy to hit the button you want without hitting other buttons by accident. If you have trouble seeing the large buttons will help too.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|It doesn't work. You have to get an upgrade to have everything to work. So I would get a different app for free online.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|All of his books are really good. I love these books! They are easy to comprehend, and you can read them in a day! Their funny too. Best book series ever
B00B7ERH04|1.0|The camera was showing upside down and you can't change it!!!!! I would never buy this app if I were you
0425263916|5.0|EWY cannot come out soon enough!! This is one of my favorite series. Way better than 50 shades! I've read this book at least a dozen times.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Taking you back in time and reliving the simple joys of being a kid.  I have no doubt these stories are memories from Clemens past as well as adventures he heard of only tweaked with his special magic.  Nothing, not even the infamous &#34;N&#34; word should offend in this book as when kids read it they need to know this was what once was.  Remind them the good of the story and downplay any negative.  I would encourage kids 13 and older to read it and adults to read it and reflect back on their own youth and adventures.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Panicked that my atomic clocks wouldn't get me to the gym on time Sunday morning after Springing forward. Downloaded this app as a triple backup. Super simple
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I liked the movie, I love the main characters journey and because he wanted to be prove that he could go &#34;into the wild.&#34;
B00846REIS|3.0|I was really hoping that this book was going to be like thirty shades...but it's not. Not even close. Don't get me wrong it was still a good read but I feel like every other day for them they were  having problem after problem and it was so unrealistic to the point it was annoying to read. There is way too much going on with them but if there is another book following this one,I will buy it simply because I want to know how it ends
B001ANSSDC|5.0|It was quite different from my normal reads but I really enjoyed it. This book shows the ugly in life and how it can be over come. This book shows reality, not fictitious dreams. It's plot isn't what you'd expect an  the ending isn't either but what makes it so good is the fact that like I said, it is the harsh reality of what could be. It shows the difference between wants and needs. It's an all around good read and I would highly recommend it.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is my favorite out of all the angry birds games..I love the colors and graphics.the.music isn't bad either..If you like angry birds then you'll love this one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is very cute. I really think it would be better if you could pick your starting breed or color though.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Great book from start to finish couldn't be happier with how it was written and spaced out and all the different out looks from so many different people and cultures too.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is the best book ever I don't want to give to much away but there are fights dramas and arrows like I said epic
B00B2V66VS|5.0|once you start playing temple run 2,you just don't want to quit. I love playing this game<br />I give it 5 plus stars. play it. you'll get hooked and is free.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Wish I could get past fungi! I  really like the concept and the kids singing, super creep lol...I just can't get past the dang fungi :(<br />Highly recommend..when you first get it good luck trying to put it down lol it's very addictive, and entertaining.
B004I744AS|5.0|I recommend this excellent app. It works wonderful in my tablet, besides its free and it has the same words than others dictionaries that you have to paid for it..
0062238868|4.0|Great insight into a true American hero. The details of his journey to becoming a Seal and his experiences in theatre are riveting.
1433502410|5.0|I like it all.  The footnotes help me with understanding what I have just read in the Bible.  In my Bible study class I use three Bibles for my homework.  The Living Study Bible, NIV Study Bible and now also the ESV Study Bible.  I like them all very much....each one is different in their footnotes so I get a lot of help to answer the questions in my study.
B007IK44CK|4.0|This movie was good for a series movie, however I felt that the action was a little lacking in this movie in comparrison to the other M;I movies.
B008M721MS|4.0|I us skype and enjoy very much. I us skype first time and I talk with my brother who live in UK.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|I saw the movie yrs ago and loved it. This is the closest book to a movie I've ever seen. Exactly like the movie. Says something about an author when they don't change anything to improve  the movie. It's a 10 ++++
B009XWD02G|1.0|I tried to download thriftshop and I clicked play it just made loud dating noises<br />I was like this is stupid please I beg you don't buy this game
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|This is The Best Show Ever Made<br /><br />Steve Buscemi is The Best Actor to Live<br /><br />So i Give it a 5/5
B004811PMO|5.0|Oklahoma is one of my all time favorites and I am so glad that I got to watch it again. I would definately reccommend it to any musical lover.
0375703764|1.0|Seriously, reading this crap was like someone vomited the dictionary on paper.  And now it's all over me.  I fell for the hype and wasted my money on this 'book'.  I know I'm in the minority here by not liking this 'book', but I wish someone had stopped me from wasting my money and time on it.  The 'book' sat in my reading pile for a year before I finally waded into it.  It's not easy to read (hint:  most of it is nonsense...skip the footnotes AND the Johnny Truant crap) unless you're half crazy or a pre-adolescent boy...then you'll love the pointless Johnny Truant parts which are basically about drugs, sex and nothing else. (The author's misogony is just disgusting and totally unnecessary.)  The only vaguely interesting part was \\"The Navidson Record\\" and in the end, even that was a letdown.  As far as this being experimental literature, I say experimental, yes...literature, hell no!!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|too slow paced. the page was busy and too much was going on the page at once. i was very disappointed.
0316056898|5.0|I have listened to this audiobook a number of times and it still makes me laugh. I love Tina Fey and would recommend this book to anyone!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|So most things scary that I do, I do it for my sister's. I love to seen their reaction because I know how scared they are/get! And this game scared my little sister to pieces, she couldn't stand looking at the screen and would freak out. Good job game! I hope I'm the next game they have more places... Maybe a few abandonedly huge buildings in which Slendy stalks you down the corridors ? I dunno! 5/5
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Be aware that this book is written as a series of interviews and comes across as a compilation of short stories all relating to one world wide event.  That said, the world created by Max Brooks is interesting and the book was hard to put down.  I'll be interested to see how this is translated to the film coming out this year.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|makes it easy if you are on the go and want to investigat items that you might be interested to purchase
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is not the type of book I would buy myself, my step-dad bought it for me and I'm not going to turn down a free book, and I'm glad I didn't because I loved this book. It was so unexpected and heartfelt. At first I was disoriented with the characters, especially in the beginning when I could tell it was different time periods, but once I figured it all out it was awesome. To see what these people are going through and what they would do to either get more time, or make time stop was just amazing. I'm so glad my step-dad got this book for me, it was a beyond amazing read!
B003MC5N28|5.0|Good goood dood good good good good goodg he dgddgd ssh dgdgdg(dgdgd ha oshsuuwhshwiwi  s uhh w in s shsjs
1878424319|5.0|This is a must read for anyone trying to grow.  Anyone with the desire to let go of guilt and move forward in their lives.  This is also a wonderful book that will help you to set some goals and manage your thoughts in a more possitive pattern.  It guids you in regard to self awarness as well as how you perceive yourselves and those around you.  Highly recomend it to all.
B00AY9RV90|3.0|... but the songs aren't terrible, just OK.  Those who are familiar with 'Waiting for the Siren's Call' will recognize that these songs were recorded during those sessions.  'Lost Sirens' is comprised of those tracks that didn't quite make the cut for the final album, and it shows.  None of these tracks are as good as the ones you'll hear on 'WFTSC' (save for 'I Told You So', which was included on the album; it appears on 'LS' as a different mix).<br /><br />On the plus side, they do all have New Order's distinctive sound -- which is nice for us fans to hear again.  :)  And since New Order have now dis-banded, 'LS' is likely the last fresh material we'll hear from them, and serves as a welcome distraction.
B005LAIIHG|3.0|...fable I would say.  I looked forward to seeing this film after all the hype (to say nothing of the Academy Awards), so it was inevitable, I suppose, that I was disappointed.<br /><br />The tension between the rational and the ineffable -- science and religion, reason vs. faith, has always been my favorite literary device.  Think \\"Inherit The Wind\\", Spencer Tracy version.  The only new insight here is the line \\"Someone else introduces us to God when we are young\\" (I paraphrase).  I let that sink in.  True enough.<br /><br />This movie reminded me in some ways of \\"Cast Away\\" -- ship/plane-wrecked at sea and lost on a deserted island.  One man has a Bengal tiger, the other a Wilson soccer ball.  Of the two films, \\"Cast Away\\" works more cogently for me at illuminating the human condition.  Faith or Fact?  The fork in the road -- the crossroad at the end of \\"Cast Away\\", and all the choices which preceeded it.  I'm not being dragged into a discussion of whether or not I \\"believe in God\\", or \\"which story I believe\\".  Better the mirror held up to see the reflection of a lifetime of choices.<br /><br />The atheist and the person of faith share the same conundrum: neither can speak rationally about the unknowable or metaphysical.  And since no one really knows, we all must wait until our fate meets us.  And therein liveth the fable.<br /><br />ADDENDUM:  I watched this movie a second time in order that I might better connect with the dialogue and narration.  I understand the question (is there a God?), but not the conclusion here: God is in the story.  Life is full of sorrow (polio, shipwrecks, evil people -- which includes the hero here, as he admits in his second version of the story), but also of beauty and joy.  But what we experience as \\"real\\" depends on how we tell the story?  And that's where we find God?  Too thin for me.  I do appreciate the author and director for tackling this question, however.  That alone makes this a better-than-average film.<br /><br />ADDENDUM #2:  I bought the 3D BluRay, and I must disagree with the people who say the 3D effects are lacking.  This is the best 3D movie I have purchased yet, including \\"Avatar\\", \\"Hugo\\", \\"Bolt\\", and \\"John Carter\\".  The 3D effects are very good on my Sony 3D BD player and 65\\" Vizio 3D HDTV.  The hummingbird at the opening credits popped right out into the middle of my living room, and I actually got seasick while watching the sinking of the ship.  Really amazing.DUM #2:  I bought the 3D BluRay, and I must disagree with the people who say the 3D effects are lacking.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|This medical doctor is very good at explaining exactly what happened to him in the days of his coma when he was able to visit heaven. He makes you realize that your brain is not really\\"you\\", your spirit or your soul is really \\"you\\". Just simply an amazing story and wonderful description of God and heaven. If you are the slightest bit curious you should read it.
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|This is the newest release from Eagles.<br />As an Eagles fan I don't need to say any further.<br />Buy this CD, if you are an Eagles fan!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is awesome I mean like you guys get to look up the where your from and it tells you the accu. weather.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is absolutely an amazing story.  There is not a whole lot more that can be said.  Read it.  Now.
B0068RHSCW|2.0|Daniel Craig and Naomi Watts.  I took the bait.  Unfortunately, I dozed off during the middle of this \\"story\\".<br /><br />Hollywood has run out of new stories to put onto film.  Blockbuster says the main character \\"left the menace of the city only to find it in the country\\".  What \\"menace\\" in the city?  Snow?<br /><br />I wish they had just named this movie \\"Writing a Novel can be a B****\\", and then at least I would have known not to rent this muddled mess.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I liked that book!  It was not the most exciting book that I have read but I wanted to read it.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I love being able to rent movies through Amazon.  I was skeptical at first but as soon as the payment went through, the movie was ready to play.
B000TETF9O|4.0|Written in the voice of Rain, from my erotic novel, [[ASIN:B00A2F1VS8 Rye]]:  I tried, really; I tried. I thought it would seduce him, sitting on the couch, grooving to some great music to get things rolling. But listening to Eno's 1974 solo album is probably the dating equivalent of rubbing his privates with sandpaper, or perhaps dumping a handful of red ants down his pants. With this new guy, it's just not gettin' the evening rolling in the manner I hoped. Now the lump is standing up, and he's looking for a clock, asking what time it is. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot! That's not what I was hoping for. Ya know, there was this one time: that guy I met in the coffee shop. By the time we hit \\"Baby's on Fire,\\" we were flirtin' and firing' on both jets at 70-miles per hour. It's rare, but when you find a guy like that, you know you have a keeper. Maybe I'll put \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" on next, or \\"Transformer.\\" One of those. That should drive this dullard out the door. Man, you just don't have what it takes. Don't you know brilliance, when you see it sitting on the couch in front of you!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Seriously this is the $2 I have spent in a long time!  It is easy but complex, my 3 year old can't play enough and frankly I play without her :)
