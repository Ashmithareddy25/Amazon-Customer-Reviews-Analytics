B005CSNXC2|4|Great fit very comfortable  love soft great color what more can I say please omg wish I hadn't started this
B001L4FJ5K|3|My husband was thrilled with the spy plane design, and the tie is of decent quality, but not nice enough to justify the $50 price tag.
B008VL8AW0|2|Was not comfortable to wear.
B002OB4234|4|Was looking to downsize my wallet and this one has worked perfectly.  I live in the UK and usually have currency in British pounds, US dollars and Euros at any given time, so the zipper compartment works great to allow me to store the currency not currently needed.
B00T64NZJ4|5|Beautiful dress. Fit my granddaughter perfectly.
B00NJ0OAEA|1|Wrong size and cheap material
B003H2L75U|4|These hats were really pretty good for the price, and they fit our giant heads, which was a pleasant surprise. They might be too large for you if you have a lil noggin.
B005X5FG2O|5|I am so loving this sports bra.  I have looked high and low but have found none that provides everything I need in a sports bra.  I tried sports bras at sporting goods stored in and around the Houston area but to no avail.  It is pricey but well worth it..... once you find this bra you will \\"look-no-more\\".
B004O90JQ8|4|Once you get the shoe on it fits great.  Just a little tough to pull over he heal.  It's the right size.  Greata water shoe for our 3 year old.
B0051U17K6|3|A bit disappointed as top slips down and has to be pulled up several times per day.  It's back to Cabelas or Wigwam for me.  Understand though that I've been delighted with other Carhartt products.
B00HUM9ADE|5|These are amazing - I purchased the Galaxy Print pants - super stretchy and a great length I am 5'9'' and about 140lbs.
B00GYTEDXQ|5|The Fuchsia is slightly darker than pictured, actually like it better , fit is perfect, I got a size large in this blouse, though I am normally a medium, 38C, 147 pounds.
B000B59XMA|5|I bought this item for a friend. The delivery time was amazing and the price is great for the quality of the item which is very good. When he saw it he loved it and fit perfectly when he put them on. This item is a great buy.
B00LIA6IIE|3|I ordered these thinking that they would fall mid thigh, I am short but these, if I would have had legs to my shoulders, they would have fit to the top.  Very Very long.
B00HRLGLE4|3|the earings are a nice touch to the perfect outfit.  simple yet classy and eligant.  Oh and delicate so handle with care.
B00FJ5LW6M|5|Great quality and Customer Service.  I bought mine and 2 weeks later I'm already buying one for a buddy of mine.  Worth the wait.
B00KYBMJ5Y|4|Very well made, very cool. Order a size up at least. If you are over 150 pounds I doubt a large will fit.
B00C77K4G4|5|the overall appearance of this scarf is stunning. I love the cascade look. also, this scarf is of nice quality fabric. love the color!!
B002PXSJ1W|4|First off, it's too bad that the original Punisher skull logo (the one on this beanie/mask) has seemingly taken a back seat to the distressed logo from the movie Thomas Jane was in. Big thanks for whomever came up with the idea for this mask!<br /><br />As for the product itself, the quality is very good, considering what some companies spit out these days for fans to blindly gobble up. The material the hat is made of is a thick, quality cotton blend of some sort I presume. The logo itself is white rubber that's been printed on the material; eventually it will probably crack and peel with many washings, but it's made to last.<br /><br />My only gripes, and the reason for the lost star, are that the eye holes are a bit small, the nose holes are a bit weird-looking if you can see skin through them, and the mask itself wears a bit tight on adults. The product is likely made for teens judging by its wear-size. Still though, awesome product!
B00DMS63CG|3|The tattoo printing looks great from the picture. but, when I looked around the Tshirt, it shows me that there are 3 parts of the tattoo printing design and they are not from one big design, but they are apart. the design at the back looks poor coz some parts of it are folded/sewn in on the side of the Tshirt.
B00OQ05N5W|1|These pants do not follow the standard U.S. Sizes. I ordered the Large and got something smaller than S Small! The material is also very thin and not as strong as spandex.
B004UCYAUU|5|Not disappointed
B003COZCIQ|4|The pants came on time and they were actually nicer than I expected. They are lightly darker than then picture and the look great and feel great on me. Good buy.
B00HBXMGGA|5|Very sexy and comfortable.  It is one of her favorites
B002CM0Q6M|5|These have good grips....
B00K5J2NQ0|5|Bought this for my son and he LOVES this shirt. Fits perfectly, true to size, and looks very handsome.
B0098MDI0A|4|The quality of the wig itself is super good, the color matches perfectly with the image of the wig and the feeling of the hair is soft and very good for the price. It's easy to brush and style, the only reason or problem that I had with it which is why I am only giving 4 stars is the size. It is small maybe even too small but I may just have a big head without even realizing that I did but I can say I have never experienced wig sizes being too small for me in any other purchases I have made in the past. But over all as long as you don't mind size I consider this wig a great purchase for its price!
B009S0S42E|4|looks just like the picture, just a littler thinner than I thought. good socks though very vibrant color. wear them everyday :)
B0006I3SCS|5|Wonderful panties.
B00A46UN16|5|Fit very well and are very soft. Also wash up well.
B00K06L918|2|Good
B00SDDKAEM|3|Pockets are to small for things like spray deodorant and shave gel.  It is well constructed.
B0090LCYC2|3|The dress is rather shapeless. The slip was not well attached and rode up around my waist when moving about. Consequently, I returned it.
B00RYPAV7G|3|A little Ill fitting at my chest but very slimming at the waist and very cute look/ stylish. I had issues tying it up too... If I tied it too tight I ended up with underboob. But if I didn't tie it tight enough I was worried I would have a nip slip. I had a hard time finding a middle ground with that. However,overall I would reccomend getting this product!!
B00LCQ83YG|1|are Levis sizes changed recently? Last year same XXL fit ok.
B00D6DW5VK|4|This is the warmest jacket I've owned... I was HOT walking around Chicago on a windy day in the single digits. I've owned 3 Columbia jackets and none were this warm. That said, they used a cheap plastic zipper. There is a bit of jiggling needed to get it in or it is &#34;off track.&#34; Other than that, it is a great coat.
B00HFOD3P8|5|i bought  this for my nephew because his going throw chemo and now he take it everywhere he loves this hat
B000UZX7AK|4|A little scratchy on the clasp in the back but otherwise it's perfect.
B00J02NJ34|2|I normally wear US L. Then I ordered XXL for this shirt. Turned out the XXL is as small as US small.
B000OYM9Q0|4|Comfortable, reliable, terrific.<br /><br />I bought these so I can wear my cowboy boots through a 16+ hour work day.  My overnight trip turned into a three day adventure.  My feet were nice and dry after 48 hours of continuous use.
B00H7TYJ7M|5|The dress was ordered and the same day I received an email double checking the size. We did a thorough measurement and the dress came in exactly in the right size and a month earlier than Amazon predicted. The seller assured me that the dress would be here in plenty of time to assure the fit was correct. My daughter was thrilled with her dress and happy with the idea of not having to go to the Bridal store for multiple fittings. I would recommend Jolly Bridal to other future brides!
B003STDNDQ|5|These are my favorite work pants. I love the way they fit & that I have plenty of pocket space.
B009FVTA6A|4|Good quality. Slightly large.
B00MYTT3IK|5|This dress is amazing it looks beautiful and such high quality.
B00266JBGA|4|This costume was adorable. The romper fit great, but the head piece was so large that it fit me, and I had to add lots of velcro to make it fit my 8 month old. But it was warm and soft and the cutest thing ever. He won cutest costume at the trunk-a-treats we took him to.
B00DHWQXHW|4|It was okay, it didn't show inside the envy bra. Also, last for 6-8 times.
B00HIKVV26|2|I am 5' 3&#34; tall and 104 pounds.  This dress did not fit as expected.  From the waist up it was big even though I ordered the smallest size.  I gave it to my sister and after she wore it, the black colour ran onto the purple even though it was in the water for about five minutes and this was handwash.  As for the material, it is a type of slinky material and not at all appropriate for the office.  I should be noted that this material is not at all forgiving so if you have any &#34;problem areas&#34; that you would to keep hidden, this is not the dress for you.  It is also a bit on the short side, as well.
B00HJ16CH8|5|so comfortable
B00VPQXV5E|1|Was horrible my daughter can wear it
B006MR8F9S|3|The suit is very cute. The sizing is not good. I normally wear a size 10.  I ordered a size 12 in this and it was too small, so I ordered a 14 and it was still too small. So now I am waiting to see if I get the next size or get a refund,
B00A3UTF58|5|I wore this dress to a recent event and I got sooooo many compliments from men and women! Everyone loved my look because it was so different from everyone else. I had the tailor fix my color so, it would stand up and it just makes this dress pop! So, classy and well made. Even my daddy who doesn't pay attention to womens fashion, liked my dress. Fit like a glove!
B00ANXMM8W|5|I made this purchase as a birthday gift for my brother, who served in the Air Force during the Vietnam era.  I like that the hat rim has &#34;Proudly Served&#34; displayed; it makes it  a little more &#34;special&#34; and gives the veterans an extra boost of pride in what they did for their country. The hat seems to be well made and of good quality.  It was well wrapped and packed. I would definitely purchase from this supplier again.
B00CTGBOR6|5|Sits perfect for its size!!!<br />I love Calvin Klein for its design and quality!<br />It was well made in China!
B0006NAS7Q|3|I'm 5'5' and 126lbs and the mediums fit but I like the way other yoga pants fit better.  I got better pants from Target a few years ago.  The kind that make you look wow but the waistband on these is too big and they cling on your thighs too tightly.  It's hard to explain but these just aren't that great in terms of fit.
B003ULOW64|5|I love this brand.. even though I need to size down w. them.  These leggings are great, because of quality and excellent fit. They come up to the waist, which I like. What I do not like is the side-closure, because it's hard to close pants that way. Frontclosure is better. Overall, a great legging and great price, have seen those for much more money elsewhere.  Thank you Amazon for your good customer service.  Other leggings I like are :\\" Splendid\\" and \\"Juicy Couture\\".  Highly recommanded.
B000P1H17O|5|I am very pleased with the service and how they called to let us know that the delivery would be delayed and the time frame it would be shipped. It actually was shipped earlier than they anticipated which was great. <br /> <br />Thanks so much. Definitely would recommend to anyone.
B00N5RWX2I|2|Shrinks up after just a couple washes, always washed cold and lowest dryer setting. Seems most Hanes t-shirts I've got over the last few years have declined in quality. Pay more for something else.
B005CW06XC|5|Item delivered on time, was as described, and enjoying item with NO problems :)
B00FLPI2G8|5|This fits really good and is very well made. It was a gift for my husband and he loves it.
B00K6N7E1Y|5|Very nice dress for parties
B005CVHJHO|5|Good to wear with all bottoms.
B0002ZOHCK|5|This item is sold out but I would like one.  Anyone have any ideas of where to get one?  NYHCknicksfan@aol.com
B00ET1V69A|5|these are extremely comfortable underwear,
B008LMUW0C|5|I purchased tow , they were bigger than expected . I kept the small size for my eldest son. But the material is good and very soft , great for my kid who has Eczema .
B00X19BGZA|4|As expected!
B00KCNZ74E|4|I like it a lot ! It takes time to learn how to put them on, but once they're on they're very nice !! The thigh straps break a little easy so you gotta be careful, but they're really well made and they're awesome !
B0052OSW9K|5|My left arm is darker than my right arm.  From all the driving I do, it was time to protect my arms from the sun.  I would buy again.  The material is easy to slide on and easy to wash.  I pull it high up on my arms and hides nicely under my t-shirts.  I walked around the stores and it looks like I am wearing a long sleeve t-shirt underneath.
B00UBDYE7Q|4|It is somewhat small, but it is cute and my little one loves it.  It looks just like the picture, the little skirt is full and she said she was a flower princess.  It is very inexpensive and even if it does not wash well, it is worth the small amount that I paid for it.
B00OQPYKJM|5|This wallet met and exceeded my expectations. It is well made and has numerous places for all of your wallet stuff.
B00ARDPBI6|4|Nice
B00OA8E2EI|5|Definitely gets the point across.
B008F9RHCW|5|Dress is beautiful. Fit is perfect. Received compliments from everyone. Slimming and nice contours. You will not regret this purchase
B003UGWIHO|5|I love this design...aaaaand so does everyone else. ABR is a great band and a lot of people agree. Anytime I've worn this shirt someone has asked me about it and threatened to steal it from me. LOL The shirt is heavy, the printing is very good, and the color scheme is awesome.
B001O9BELA|5|Good fit. Leg elastic maintained after several washings.
B000VZ5SFQ|4|The wig did not wear as shown.  It wore more like one of the Beetles than Clark Kent.  It still served the purpose.
B000A8MH5S|3|I was surprised to see the actual color of the hat did not match the color chart on the internet.  I thought the hat was more of a light gray instead it was more of a off white.  It was not the color I was looking for.<br /><br />Thanks,<br /><br />Valerie
B00KIF514W|5|Gift for my nieces daughter for next year could not pass up this beautiful little bargain.
B0040GEXIU|5|TY Amazon perfect fit!  Really I love diesel jeans and think they need more boot cut dark washes like this.  They just need simple rear pockets like the old ones they used to make.  Other then that the cut is still perfect.
B003DKP9FU|5|Great quality, and vibrant color.  Very accurate photo and description online, so no suprises.  My gift recipient (a bow tie enthusiast) was very pleased with this tie.
B0041VMVEC|5|I love these panties. They fit so well , and launder so well and feel so comfortable !
B00JFITW84|3|This is a descent skirt but it does run small watch out I am a size 14 and the XL is still a bit tight.  Overall the skirt is nice though it would be better if the sizing was correct.  Guess it is motivation to lose some weight!
B00BCUOPRQ|5|Short length is perfect for me.
B00DOZO0B8|5|Fits well, very comfortable.
B00C6F0MPK|5|my daughter loves it. she just found out though she's not allowed to wear it to school because it has a weapon on it. seems a little ridiculous to me, but rules are rules.
B001KNRGBC|4|These jeans fit snug on the lower legs..tapered. They slither on down the leg, feel smooth and slick! They are strongly made, well sewn, with a good tough denim. Made in Italy.<br />The buttons on the button fly are bigger and more sturdy than a certain other very popular brand of button-fly jeans.<br />The dark color is not dyed all the way through the jeans, on both the warp and weft, so some little tiny white dots are there, and could be more exposed if a snag or hole should appear, or eventual fading occurs.<br />They do have multiple labels, including a couple of embroidered ones. I removed the outer labels with the help of a small knife, but couldn't quite get the last ones, for each button and even rivet wants to remind us of the company.<br />They do cost quite a lot, for jeans, even well-made ones. I'd recommend looking for some kind of sale.<br />I looked up this company because of their advertising using as a model Magnus Carlsen, the new over-the-board world chess champ.<br />Overall a pretty tough, fashionable pair of designer jeans.<br />Eventually, like maybe on Black Friday or some other such time, I might very well shop for another pair of jeans or something else from this same company.
B00BZ5V5K8|2|size description said it fits 0-2. Item arrived and actually fits closer to 2-3 sizing. Returned it.
B00C6WCLC0|4|...but slightly smaller than I'd have liked for a bag like this. Won't take as much stuff as I'd like.
B008W1T5XW|4|Very comfy.
B000N8TEL0|4|Bought these for my son, and they run small.  My suggestion is to buy the next larger size for the correct fit.  Other than that, they are well made and hold up great.
B00LW2LMMK|5|It is a great deal
B00MMOZUMK|5|Love it!!! Can't wait to wear it
B0051BSW3A|5|These suspenders were the perfect color and fit for our son's wedding.  The arrived quickly and we were more than pleased.
B001WAL3FS|5|W e love it- Bought it for my husband and it's really soft and fun! Unfortunately the dog has already gotten to the collar- so we are getting another because it is super nice! :)
B0050276BO|5|This is my favorite nursing bra so far.  I really like that its stays in place when the flaps fold down (unlike those where the cup and strap detach completely).
B00FZR1C7I|5|I have worn this brand for years.  They have kept their sizing true!
B00GH9WI4E|5|I finally found the bra the fits perfectly and provides comfort and support. Loved this product that I had to buy more than one.
B00T829D5O|5|Nice, thick cotton tee-shirt, pre-shrunk, very high quality, fit as expected!
B007MM1LSE|5|This robe is super soft and cozy.  I also love how the belt is attached so I'll never loose it!
B00N5O34EC|5|Wow!!! I am amazed as to how GREAT this hoodie fits. Never have I ever gotten a hoodie that fits PERFECTLY as this one does. Either they are a bit too big or a bit too small. This one is in the Goldie Locks zone 😆. I love love love it. The chest fits right and the torso has room and still gives me a slimming look. And when it is open with a nice undershirt.. the sides fall evenly spaced and gives that chic look that I was going for when I first saw them. Great products. I have the red and white.
B00XNCTQ48|5|Really cute.  Fits nice.
B00NAFI3TW|3|The straps are very unreliable: they have already stretched considerably (I wore it a couple of times), will have to shorten them. The adjustment thingy on one of them is sewn wrong, which is pretty annoying. Otherwise, I like the dress, it's very comfortable, the fsbric is not flimsy and not trandparent, very flattering as well.
B00AWMQMIA|5|love this product.  I have had recent abdominal surgery and this is just enough gentle support to make me much more comfortable
B00HF1AMXM|5|I bought these a little bit larger than I needed.  I'm a 33 waist and I bought a 34.  It's a great fit.  They are lightweight, good construction.  The zipper is a little stiff but not the end of the world.  Color matches the image perfectly.<br /><br />Great for summer!
B00I6DEQBM|5|It is a very elegant dress
B00HA0SYRO|5|i love this scarf it came a lot earlier then expected i wasn't expecting to get it til the end of march and i got it only 10 days after ordering the quality feels and look like it will hold nice for being a sheer scarf i would say if your looking for warmth i wouldn't get it but if its just to look cute i would totally buy it again and am going to as a birthday present for my niece and cousin they will both love it as well
B00MLNCXOA|2|The dress is very transparent.
B00IXIU3DK|5|Very cute soccer outfit for $20. Perfect for soccer class. Fits like a real like size 5. A bit on the slim size.
B00N659V9C|5|I absolutely love these pins! They're Gorillaz pins after all. They are quite small, but I still love them. I would recommend to any Gorillaz fan.
B00IGAOBEC|1|Extremely uncomfortable, and the company won't take it back. Will never purchase there brand again
B00I55MPN2|5|Thanks for the shorts they fit just as I expected.  I can't wait for the weather to get warm so that I can wear them.  Only wish I had ordered the red ones as well.  Keep making the good stuff.
B00NSS31E8|5|It's a great product. I am a little chunky and it's fits great.
B00CX0LZF4|5|16 slims are hard to find, levi 505's a great jean,great fit great quality,great service amazon, no hassle at the store, just great fit, great jean, great service at my front door.
B002XCPVPW|5|These are super cute, soft and really a perfect fit.  I wore them with boots and they finished my outfit perfectly.  I will absolutely order more in other colors.  I love them!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002U2NA44|5|I love Justin Bieber sooooo much so it doesn't matter what's wrong with this product-at least I'm wearing Justin Bieber!!!!!<br /><br />&lt;3 him &lt;3
B00KXBK2NG|5|The quality is very Good and fast shipping thank you.
B00S618AJS|4|My girl likes this dress a lot. She is a typical size 12/14 girls and this dress fit nicely. However, it was a bit shorter than I would have liked but it's not incredibly short. I have not attempted to wash it yet, but the fit is true to size for my girl, age 11.
B00JTQ2QJ4|3|It is a man's size so order as if you are buying a man's t shirt.
B0056C1GG4|4|In overall the product is ok, but the fabric is not very good qualilty:  - . . . . .
B0075MNRLU|2|I bought them for the kids. They were huge!! They dont merely fit me! So disappointed, what was thought to be a great gift.. failed. :( I had to customize them myself. Ive never seen a human being with a big enough head to fit in those hats!!!
B009XRFGLY|3|You get what you pay for...  Material is flimsy... So any rough play, it's ripping.<br />I'm just over 5&#34;7 tall and at a athletic 155lbs.... Normally I wear a size Medium.  THIS outfit is listed a &#34;Xtra Large&#34; and fits me COMFORTABLY.  Smaller sizes would be too small. ★  The mask, is a joke. I wouldn't buy the mask for a dollar.
B00LQEJYDS|4|They are very soft and comfortable.
B00NYCVK6O|4|They are a lil small had to do a lil shimmying to get them on & I wear a 14/16. I don't feel these are truly one size fits all. I believe if you're much bigger than me that they'd fit you comfortably. They are warm though I had no complaints wearing them on a rainy 40 degree day
B00IO9JCY4|4|Great socks....Just a little tight around the calf...But they do go up to the knee.
B00PH491OK|3|It's only one size so i hope it fits!
B008S47E40|5|This piece is super pretty and the pearl eyebrows and forehead jewel are quite exquisite. I felt really elegant the whole time I wore it. Great value!!
B000EE1NNA|5|Really cute and comfortable costume.  Used it for patriotic boat parade.....Theme was &#34;For truth, Justice, and the American Way&#34;....with Capt. America and Wonder Woman
B00AWB0Y8K|4|Fits true to size, has plenty of padding, looks good in my jeans. I'm happy I have the butt I used to have in my 20s.
B007YZK6TO|4|I love this jacket, although, it does make me feel childish because it's so bright. Keeps me dry and happy though!
B00CBESBAY|5|GREAT
B00506RANO|3|The hat is sufficient in quality but I bought this for one of my students and it was quite big. It fit my husband's head!
B00IHPLHKM|2|Childs medium, maybe. Cheaply made and sash didn't match the robe at all. Looked like someone just threw in a sash from scrap material
B001RRBW20|1|I placed an order for this product on April 15th, it was supposed to be delivered by April 24th. I did not receive the merchandise so i contacted the seller on May 1st asking for a tracking number so i may track the package since i had not received the merchandise. Well, i never got any feed back from the seller. On May 7th still no feedback from the seller and no merchandise, so i emailed them asking to cancel my order and refund my money. I also called Amazon customer service and they were very helpful and apologized for the problem. The representative started the claim process to insure my funds would be refunded. Although my experience with this seller was terrible i would still recommend purchasing goods from Amazon they back their customers 100%.
B00ABAKXKG|5|Socks are warm and dry. Work well under boots or shoes and wicking action keeps moisture at bay. Feet were cozy all day.
B00DRUYT0C|3|Ordered in 2 sizes larger than normal and it still was too small.  Gave it to my 10 year old daughter and with a single cuff roll it fit her perfect (it was an XL).
B00CMM34JS|5|Very sexy but classy lace top. Navy blue is a nice change from black. Fits just right hugs your curves without being too tight.
B00DGYGIQC|5|Love this top. I get so many compliments when I wear this top. I put on weight due to a severe ankle break, so I ordered an xl and fits perfect. I am 5'7&#34; and 185 pounds. This top makes me look thinner... love it
B00FQ0Z0QS|2|just to small and I ordered a large and it is to much of a problem to return. So not have a printer to print authorization. Very disappointed.
B00DRHQHZU|1|The items m I ordered Was NOT the size I ordered... Didn't have time to get the right one either...
B00AZXHZ0K|5|Love it. Sturdy, tough work shirts.
B00NF5T314|2|Definitely NOT a woman's coat... This is more of a Juniors size. Got a Large for my sister (who's 5'3, 123lbs, small build with braid shoulders) and there's no way she could put it on... Gave it to my 14y/o niece that it fit better on... Kind of disappointed. Gave it a 2-star only because the material is fantastic!
B00VEB5AJA|5|Great room and will probably wear them post baby while working out until my normal shorts fit again.
B00505DW8W|4|No headband was included with this item.
B002TE5ZBO|3|I wear a large in every other 'polo', and this brand appears to run a tad small. You may want to order one size up for a proper fit. Other than the sizing issue it appears to be a decent product.<br /><br />** Edit 3/29/13 **<br /><br />Current Amazon pricing for this polo in most sizes and colors is msrp @ $55 ea. I paid close to half of that in Oct. 2012. Check out the U.S. Polo Assn. Men's Solid Polo With Small Pony for an alternative. They run true to size and are a fraction of the cost ($20).
B0011EB5P8|5|It is no small thing when you find the perfect bra. I should know. I have been looking for it since the day I moved from my training bra with the little heart in the middle to the grown up undies. It took a while, but it was worth the wait.<br /><br />I cannot STAND pulling my bra straps up. I LOVE racer backs because that pretty much alleviates that problem. In an effort to deal with that in the easiest way imaginable, I started wearing bras in the same vein as \\"Ahhhh\\" or the Genie bra. These bras are fine, if you have just had it with trying to mix comfort and shape, and comfort won the battle.  But if you want some shape, those bras are almost like binding your breasts. And that is fine if you are getting ready to play  Yentle.<br /><br />With this bra, I can have great shape and comfort, without compromising either one. The straps are always in place, and, unlike other racer back front closures I've seen, the back straps are wide enough so the back stays smooth even in the lightest fabric.<br /><br />Several ears ago, I had a shoulder replacement, and clipping bras in the back is not very enjoyable. So, of course, I love the front closure. It really is the bra I have been searching for.<br /><br />I actually found this bra at Ross. But you know how that goes; you never see it again. I am delighted that I can buy these through Amazon.
B007VY8DXE|3|Love the dress. Fits as expected (true to American size standards). One flaw, the adjustable straps are made of the same spandex material as the dress, which means the straps stretch...this is very problematic. Because I can sew well, I will be removing the straps for material ones that will not stretch. Another flaw is the breast area does not have padding. I hope this style will address these issues, if they do, it will be a fantastic dress worthy of five stars...as it stands in it's current form only earns a three star rating.
B00I5UUOMQ|5|love this it really helps my waist
B00AFQFHPM|1|fits very weird around d hips, like bites to them... returned but they took 6$
B007RM4RG2|3|My son LOVES robots so we got him this shit for his birthday. The shirt looks exactly as pictured and appears very cute. However it is very itchy. There is no liner or layer between the aplique and the wearer. He complained about all the strings poking him and now hates the shirt. I tried having him wear an undershirt but he says he can still feel the itchy part. Plus there is soooo much fabric the front is heavy and pulls.
B00HBLRSCO|1|The correct phrase is &#34;Wonder Twin Powers, Activate!&#34; not Wonder Twins Power. If you watched the show or researched it online, you'd know this...
B00FODHMJK|1|Way to small
B00AKATFYM|3|I ordered this thinking it would be 2 pieces but it is only the top. Otherwise it seems high quality.
B00AQG69E4|4|This appears to be a well-made wool beanie which does not itch and looks attractive. Some may consider the one-size-fits-all problematic. My head is relatively small and the cap fits it like a glove. If I pull it down over my ears it will ride back up above them within a short time. The photo shown is pretty much accurate. Overall I'm happy with the purchase. Inexpensive for what appears to be pure wool and I think it is sufficiently well constructed to last through 2 or 3 winters if moths don't get to it sooner.
B00EARPCXO|5|Leggings + Built-In Shape Wear = Genius.<br /><br />I used to only wear Lululemon brand leggings because they are durable and tight enough to make me feel slim and supported. Also, if my lulu's ever started to pill, they replace them free. I honestly like these BETTER. My &#34;wunder under&#34; pants are too long in the legs and made me feel like I had cankles when I rolled them up. These cut off right above the ankle but can be pulled down or up depending on how you want to wear them.<br /><br />I now have 3 pairs of these, I LOVE them! I am in good shape but love the extra support these give my lower abs and inner thighs. I ordered a size SMALL but they are a little sheer in the bum when I bend over.<br /><br />Height: 5'4&#34;<br />Weight: 115<br />Waist: 26&#34;<br /><br />Sometimes I wear 2 leggings together which solves the see-through problem. These are my favorite for working out because they keep me cool and dry quickly.<br /><br />These are made with 90% Nylon which is more resistant to pilling than most man-made fibres but I still wouldn't wash these with towels or sit on concrete/abrasive surfaces while wearing these.
B00EUZ28L0|5|LOVE THE CLASSY LOOK ON MY TWO GIRLIES! JUST ENOUGH OF BOTH COLORS; FITS THEM SNUGLY AND COMFORTABLY. WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THEM FOR YOUR LITTLE ONES!
B00OY8OFLO|5|I absolutely love these jeggings! They are the perfect fit and are true to your size. They look great on me, so great I just ordered another pair in a different color.
B007FPQ0WU|2|One side was loose when it arrived and then it didn't take long to peel half off.  The replacement pair are better but same thing.  Came in unattached on one side and I had to Gorilla glue it.  They are as they appear though.  As a novely/costume with brief use, they'll probably be fine after you add glue.
B0077AR4VY|5|Seafolly is an Australian brand that was recommended to me by a friend, I found it tough to find it online in North America so I was happy to find it on Amazon. Seafolly is pricey, but when it comes to swim suits they are worth every penny because you feel comfortable and confident. Depending on the cut there is the right amount of coverage and the materials and colors are amazing. I have been wearing Billabong and Roxy in the past, but I was consistently uncomfortable in the bottoms of those suits, although the tops were a good fit.  Since I have invested in my first Seafolly swimsuits I will not be going back. You can mix and match sizes, styles and patterns and they offer different styles in their basic colors which makes it easy to color block and follow the trends. For example, the goddess bottoms and the hipster bottoms are offered in the basic colors which easily match to a variety of patterned tops and vice versa.  Mixing sizes is especially beneficial for DD ladies who require a smaller bottom. Australian sizes are different and the conversions are: 16 AUS = 14 US, 14 AUS = 12 US, 12 AUS = 10 US, 10 AUS = 8 US, 8 AUS = 6 US, 6 AUS = 4 US. The suits are true to size and I ordered online and got a perfect fit the first time. If in doubt you can search the Seafolly size chart online and it will show the actual measurements. On Amazon the sizes are shown in US, so order the size you would be in the US. I appreciate that Seafolly is made properly and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Now I am just waiting for Amazon to offer new styles for me to order.<br /><br />The Sophia Bandeau in Tangerine is a beautiful bandeau top. The construction is top quality with soft cups, which are hidden well and side boning to keep the top in place. It offers a lot of coverage and although I think it is a good fit, I would consider going down a size as the cups are largish and there is a bit of extra material at the bottom. The color and pattern are very nice and I matched itwith the coral hipster bottoms and they match perfectly. It comes with a detachable neck strap which is helpful when swimming.
B00KG0GBCK|5|Just as expected. Soft fleece, fits my 6 foot 1 husband.
B00C1ESSZC|5|excelente
B0007KPP6W|4|Nice scrubs very comfortable
B0091ENW9C|4|They workers for us because we ordered a couple of sizes up.<br />The material is good quality yet thin and cool for summer. Light weight.<br />I ordered another one this time 3 sizes up. But we dress our son baggy for comfort.
B006X137WS|5|So soft and nice fit for what I needed! I am adding some embroidered designs. It is holding up nicely!
B00EDJBEAO|4|my three year old loved the dinosaur pattern on the shirt so I'm happy with my purchase
B00LYLR1UG|5|Great backpack.  Love that the lunch box is attached.  My daughter loves it.  Was exactly what I expected!
B009YDDMO0|5|Great Coat, Amazing Price.
B001CRA3PW|5|Great shirt<br />Granddaughter loved it<br />Somewhat large but that was OK for her to grow some more and be able to wear longer
B00ETSMC50|2|I received this item January 23, 2014.  It waste, wrapped in plastic.  Next it is very small.  Not as expected.<br />Will give it to a family member.  It is small for my head.
B00WU2JZB6|1|Not only is this much smaller than expected, it is also so thin that you can see directly through it. Definitely can't wear this.
B006H4KQF2|5|Lucky seems to always do a great job with great detail and quality.  Bought for shirt fussy boyfriend he always seems to love the Lucky Brand shirts.  Large fit him great.  He's a 41 1/2\\" chest and 38 1/2\\" waist.  Also bought the El Rey design shirt.  He loved both
B00KWCX9ZO|5|Nice shirt great service
B00W3JQIS4|1|Edited: I loved these bras the first few times I wore them. Unfortunately, within a week and about 4 washes, both bras are stretched out so much that they can no longer be worn. I am very disappointed that I spent so much money on these and they are garbage. Especially since all these other reviewers were given bras for free in exchange for positive reviews. Don't waste your money like I did.     Original review: I have looked high and low for a racerback nursing bra without the sports-bra seams. I am so glad to find this. I am small (34-36 B) and ordered a small. I was expecting a tighter fit but it works and is quite comfortable. I love that the straps are adjustable. The material is soft. I've already ordered a second one.
B00BG462TC|2|Very tight and the pattern was dull compared to the photo. Definitely for long/lean figures. It is not curve friendly and offered no stretch.  I had to return it.
B00WHMS1C8|5|This comes just as advertised.  great quality!!!!  Works well.  Doesn't slip.  I love the bright color b/c it makes identifying my bag easier.
B00I6677YM|5|I absolutely love it!
B00MY8H1U8|5|As advertised. These have come in very handy during this cold winter. They have kept my granddaughter warm when playing outside and sledding.
B00AQ114XK|5|I purchased the M size I am 137 pound and 5'1 tall I really like it how fits the dress is right on my knee and I love the way that look around my waist the broche  look pretty nice I have complements my breast was perfect and no need to use bra. Great buy I will use again for other party, the color is like the pic.<br />Thanks
B000JC9V1I|5|Well-made, durable material, strong seams, and stylish fit. One of my new favorites.
B00W36Z9EQ|4|Snug!!
B00O9WVFSG|1|Once again Asian sizes, bumper. Too small.
B00ITQ6WE0|3|It's a nice sweatshirt but get a size bigger than what the size chart says my wife's is a little small.
B00FJAR3N8|5|I am taller and these shirts have the perfect sleeve length. Cozy, soft material, and still professional enough under the scrub top. They match perfectly!
B00EDIG3XS|1|I ordered the 4yr size...came as xxxxlg..looks like a size 10-12.
B008HZ9LN2|4|I ordered this dress for a father/daughter dance and couldn't have been happier with the fit. My daughter is 8 and I ordered the 10. The color was nice and shimmered in the light.
B00E1JLOYM|5|The problem with making purchases based on customer reviews is that sometimes it could throw you off. The quality of this top is excellent. Cat lovers like myself would LOVE it. However the sizes run big...take my dumb advice and order one size down from your normal size. I took mine to a seamstress to have it altered. I usually wear size large and this fit like a XXL. The style is supposed to be loose but this fit like a night shirt .
B00LI3V9AI|3|I appreciate it because it is 100% cotton.  However, the texture is a little rough, lots of flakey lint came out in the wash, and this is not especially cheap for socks.  Also, there was a longish white nick in the material (see pix).  Will have to wear this at home.  Hope there will be other brands of all-cotton tube socks out there!  All-cotton socks are a basic!
B000N8X42A|5|Good
B008AGXNPU|3|We bought this hat after losing a similar pendleton hat while attending a medica presentation--(someone took it in the short time we returned to look for it!)  My husband really liked that hat, so we were excited to get it replaced.  The new one is ok, but being made in China it appears to be of a somewhat less quality material than the original, and I think the brim is a little wider.  No big deal, still looks good, but we still miss the old one!  If we hadn't had the old one we wouldn't have any problem with it.
B00MBD6FNA|5|very good
B007KFZFO4|4|Fits well. Some people said to order a smaller cup or whatever and I did not. I'm a 38F and that is what I ordered and it fits just fine.
B00IVRCX54|5|Great price and very well made. I should have bought 2 packages!
B007WTSU3Q|5|Was packaged nice, no damage! Shipping was quick! Looks like the picture! He hasnt worn it yet but he will be wearing it saturday for his party!
B00KRJUGMG|4|I was forced to buy this. I am not proud, but as far as brown handkerchiefs go, these are among the best I have seen in my 28 years of life.
B00AW83JLM|5|Fit was fine. Loved the tunic!
B002INPU8Y|4|I needed to pin on the blue cloth as it fell off very easy while wearing the costume.  It was a bit sheer, but comfortable and looked good for the price.
B006HT3DA2|5|Great company. Great product.  Very light weight, yet keeps you warm in an air conditioned room.  Easy to carry around.
B0013BPIY8|4|I have several pairs of these shorts which I have washed many times and they fit nicely but apparently they are cut differently now. When I ordered the same size, much too tight. The next size up fit fine.
B002T6NMWQ|1|Doesn't hold tummy in
B00GYRDHFI|5|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  I expect it will be worn very frequently all fall and winter.
B00E4K7UIW|5|These shirts run very small definitely buy a size or two bigger but my son loves all metal mulisha shirts
B00R57DVJI|5|I got a large because I have a large butt. I loved it and it was a big hit as I danced the night away. Not see through and very comfy. Will buy from them again.
B00FSKOW6A|5|Awesome shirt.
B0081UB0CS|5|This was the best thing I did to compelet my uniform! I will tell all my friends what a good choice to use Amazon.
B008BVJY9S|4|Great wallet! The only problem I had was that there was another person's insurance information in the wallet when I received it.  However, there was not really any visible wear and tear from this and the wallet looked great.  Overall great product!
B00PDK9HDI|4|It was a bit small. I&#34;m usually a medium but I bought a large and it was still a bit small on me. Recommend going 2 sizes up if you can. The material is great and the shirt looks exactly like the picture
B00QXECF1O|5|Dress is really pretty and fit my niece perfectly.
B00SMMHVCS|1|Too flimsy.  Doesn't hold.
B00DS6ZWQU|5|Purchased XS. I love the poinsettia color, fit and quality construction. They are lightweight and breathable. I've worn them for Zumba and body pump. Good support in the knees. I've had complements on the style and color. Some of the gals say they can only find black tights. I steer them to Amazon to look for color selections and bargain prices. Puma, Fila, Champion brands size XS are true to size for me.
B00LGIDDT0|1|This brand runs VERY small. I measure and 32DDD in all other brands I've tried. The band was extremely tight on this one and the cup size was WAY off (much too small). Definitely returned.
B00DTTVEL8|5|Great price, great quality and style. Definitely a skinnier tie, so looks great with a more casual outfit, but will still work well in professional settings.
B00ILUTUFW|5|Very cute, works nice with a purse organizer too!
B000UZ7Q70|1|Zipper broke the next day after delivery. Not a good quality.
B00B2L7G7G|4|THEY FIT GOOD,THEY FEEL GOOD,I LKE EM.. --------- ----- -- -- -- -- -- --- - - --- - -
B004PZFC86|4|I ordered the wrong size..
B0027VT614|5|This was a big hit at our party!
B0058LVH6M|1|The 2 hats I got were Not what I expected for the price. the shipping charge of almost $10. was more than these hats were worth. one was made in vietnam the other in bangladesh, this was not advertized by the seller i was pinhooked
B00A8O0CAG|1|To small
B001FOR2CY|2|Clasp is not mated to belt.  Diffficult to secure, then almost impossible to unlock.  Ackward enough it's not worth the trouble.  Genuine military grade belts do not display this weakness.
B00120XA68|3|My friend and I went as cops for halloween...these fit ok, runs small, still very short (i'm 5'3&#34;) it does come with a lot of extras...
B00VRDE1QS|1|Bought the shirt for my wife. After washing the shirt the letters seem to fade. Was not what I expected. I could have made this for half the price.
B0014Z3FGG|3|I received this jacket, for the price, how bad could it be. The jacket wasnt so bad, do-able for the price except for the fur trimmed hood which was terrible but can be zipped off. I gave this jacket 3 stars, but in rating this company I would give it a ONE star. The jacket arrived, and they sent me the wrong size. Trying to get a hold of anyone by phone or email...IMPOSSIBLE. The emails I received were that for a return I was responsible for the shipping expense back to them along with their policy being they deduct original shipping fees from your refund. I kept sending emails asking if they could compinsate any shipping fees being it was their mistake in sending the wrong size jacket, and no response. Mind you I called numerous times with no response, a recorded message saying they will call you back, which they never did.  So Frustrating!!!  Being it they sent me the wrong item, and it was their mistake, I didnt feel I should be out any expense. Well, they dont see it that way, Im out of luck. All I wanted was the right size. Thankfully the item wasnt that expensive. I am keeping it and will give it away to someone who could use a jacket, figuring by the time I pay to ship it back and then have the monies in shipping deducted on their end from the origianl purchase, I would only be getting back about 5 dollars tops, not worth the aggravation, but I am sure they bank on that. Its not that I was returning something I didnt want or that I changed my mind, I then understand the deduction in shipping costs, but I just wanted them to give me what I originally ordered and paid for. There is no excuse for this type of buisness.
B00JM6911M|4|Bought for my son. Good quality.
B00MYZ1SOQ|5|I had a pair of these already, so I already knew the quality and comfort. I was happy to find another color.
B00A72I7DS|5|A gift my brother enjoyed getting from me for Christmas!  The picture is was exactly what was delivered.  They were not thick, but very stylish.
B004PEI57W|1|Not at all what I expected... It is very stiff and runs large.
B002QFMX9I|5|I LOVE Isotoner gloves.  I'd had a lined pair and an unlined pair for years.  Unfortunately I lost both pairs last sping.  As soon as it started getting cold again this winter I tried some other gloves that I had stored away, but none are as good. I could not go any longer without replacing my Isotoners.  I purchased a lined and an unlined pair. They are flexible enought that you can move your hands easily, thin enough that you can still feel to find something in your purse ... and they keep you warm!  Love my Isotoners!
B00B4QOUGO|2|The `petite' factoring is only within the length. The rise/waist is just above my natural waistline which, in turn, makes the waist uncomforable.
B00GUK8VC8|5|I received this product in exchange for an honest review. I really like these pj's I got a medium and they fit pretty good. Also they are super soft and they feel thick to the touch. i live in michigan and wore them outside to let my dogs out and i couldn't feel any cold or wind through the pj's. Also i got the green color and its a really pretty pastel. i would buy these for family and maybe again for myself.
B00JH0D1F0|5|I bought this for my sister in law and she really looks great in it.  She loves it and it goes with so many things she has.  It is good for dressy and casual.  It fits great and looks great!
B007G0ISSI|5|This hat is so soft and well made.  It is cute on and warm.  Love it. Bought two.  One for mom and me.
B00INMSQDK|5|I love love love these shorts. They are stretchy and so comfortable! And super cute to top it off! Good shorts for curvy girls!
B000KN6NIU|5|Great quality and most importantly they stay tucked in!
B00OV3JVIE|5|Burt's Bees makes the cutest baby clothes. Love these pj's, they are the second set I've ordered.
B0037ZB5CM|5|Love these scrubs. Difficult to find in stores. Will be buying more.
B00HZ3ITUI|5|People take a double take with this one!
B001RNO45Q|5|Bought for my bf n he loved it
B00RL4CX58|5|Calvin Klein's Lace Up Dolman Top is absolutely the style I've been looking for and it came in time for a special event. I got many comments on it and know I'll be wearing again soon..
B008R96IOI|2|I found this bra ran larger than other lilyette bras I have purchased.  It isn't one of my favourites.  I think the fit for me isn't good and that is what is truly important in a bra.
B00IAC17G6|5|Love them!  Wore them to Jurassic World premier.
B004S7SS8M|5|These are great jeans.  I know they’re expensive, but they don’t get baggy, and are super comfortable.  There are no buttons or zippers to catch on sweaters or other garments.  They have a clean line which make you appear slimmer.  Another plus (which may seem silly) is that you never have to worry about weather you forgot to zip up your jeans.  Love these, highly recommend.
B00C9SUTIE|5|Fits and looks amazing.  I got a ton of compliments.  It's just the right length too, not too short and not too long.  I got mine in blue and the color is beautiful.
B001KAH43U|3|Poor quality
B00HSC9YVO|5|I had purchased a pair of these pants at a local store - bought the only ones they had - so went to Amazon and found them again!  I ordered the same size I purchased at the store and they fit perfectly
B00O806EBW|4|This sweatshirt is soft and very cute. The mermaid is a little faded, but I think that's supposed to be the style. Overall, I'm happy with it.
B00DB9BXS0|5|Fits perfectly!
B00KS164MY|3|I'm a 2X and got that size.  It is a bit on the small side for me.  Also, the top doesn't want to stay in place - it rolls.  This is a nice idea that doesn't do much for me.
B00245G37S|4|Excellent quality. Very comfortable and come at a reasonable price. I would recommend a size smaller than what you may think you are.
B003RA960K|5|Remember you get what you pay. For the price it wasn't bad.<br />She can mix and match with differint outfits. Shipping was Free<br />$12 or $13 dollars isn't Bad. If you need a heavy duty collar<br />serch around amazom. I saw one for $29.00
B003TFE5H2|3|the width of it is too large for it to be able to pull my boobs together. otherwise its pretty good; sticks well, cup size is good.
B00EZYQORU|5|Love it! :)
B00H5EOK82|5|I went along with what everyone was saying in the comments about the jacket fitting smaller than what the sizes were supposed to be, so i ordered 2 sizes up. I'm 5&#34;1 and i'm very petite, so normally i'm a size small, but i actually ordered 2 sizes up so i ordered a large and it ended up fitting me perfectly. It doesn't ride up or anything, and the sleeves are loose enough to wear a heavy shirt underneath for in the winter. I love this jacket!! ...But i don't know why some people were complaining they ordered this jacket and a different jacket came because i ordered mine and it looked exactly like the picture and exactly what i was looking for! Also it came within 3 days after ordering, so i was very happy about that too :)
B00L62BVEK|5|My daughter loves it!  Excellent quality!!!
B00MC7DVAA|5|Thank you
B0085K3676|5|Pretty and sturdy -- very comfortable and nice bra. Fits very well.
B006TBPLSK|5|We purchased this set as a gift for some friends for their newborn. It's actually really nice to have the complete little set and it should work out great for them. Nothing earth shattering here, but if you have friends who dig the pirate thing, get this for their little munchkin!
B00KRNZTIS|5|Nice quality t shirt. If your husband is a &#34;The Godfather fan&#34;, as most men are, he will love this
B00CD9LXF2|4|Fights just right. I feel pretty in this. Would buy another in another color. I wear around house and to bed. Kind of stiff<br />at first just needs to wash a few. Didn't bleed. Good for a pear body, but has some room for those of us ladies who<br />are a little more blessed. No problems in hip area, lots of room. I am a size 10-12 and it makes me look cute.
B00JVWUBMK|5|good quality and fit
B005CZUPZI|5|Cheeky! best describes this pair of panties. The sheer net and lace panty fit well with no pulling. The breathable fabrication makes you feel as if you are wearing nothing.
B00L0QSJCO|5|This shirt fits great will definitely continue to buy from Haggar!
B00LW4R6O6|4|I bought the size 8 for my six year old. He loves them. They are super soft and comfy, but a bit on the small side. I am glad I bought a size up, but wish I would have gone up one more size so they would fit him for longer since he is so tall and skinny. They were a gift for Christmas and will fit him through the winter/early spring.
B00L3257VQ|5|I like them!
B001GJMUP2|1|I was really excited to get this dress. I wasn't impressed when I took it out of the packaging, but I let it hang up for a day or so before trying on. I'm not a huge person and it did not fit me at all the way the picture looks. The &#34;fringe&#34; at the bottom looked cheap and I was afraid to iron it thinking the material may melt. Overall the best thing about the costume was the necklace, which I wore with another dress.
B0049HQ0L8|5|Son loves them
B002K66H5Y|5|I purchased these gloves for myself when I purchased the men's version for my son.  The leather is soft and the rabbit fur is cuddly and warm.  And the price was right, also.
B00NF3S5TW|4|gift
B00APPHN32|5|Great!
B00EI8SXH2|5|Teacher sweater.
B0051D9NR2|5|Very warm and fits great! My nephew has a large head for a 2 year old and it is perfect.
B00A1S0COU|5|Great
B001LFP0EO|5|I like this product, but not as much as the Shrinkx band I also purchased. This band is flexible, but not comfortable enough to wear while sitting. I do believe it has helped shrink my belly though.
B00PRUCDFI|5|I love Paige Lauren Baby clothes! They are super soft and have the cutest designs. I buy them for all my new mom friends. They are a wonderful baby shower gift!
B00BCHVBTY|5|The best recommendation is that my husband said he liked them; but, he has already started wearing them.  They look consistent with the pictures.
B00FAYGXB6|5|Not as much stretch as some of the other NYDJ products.  Perfect for a curvy figure when you want to avoid the waist gap typical pant give.
B0009UAM7W|4|First off, please wash when you get this item. Other wise you get little fuzzys all over your undershirt. I have washed this sweatshirt like 6 times and the color has remained the same. It is on the big side, so order a smaller size. I can wear a medium, but its a little tight. With this sweatshirt, its very baggy. It is comfortable, and warm.
B00NNFJIAM|1|Do NOT buy unless its as a childs size
B000IN581A|5|Couldn't find the right size at the stores.  Easily found the size and color I needed on-line. This is very comfortable to wear even all day.
B00D6AP2V8|5|My dauther is 15 months old. She is in 9.4kg and 76cm. It is a little loose but she is only 15 months. Her jeans are size 18 month.<br />I think 18 months babies are fit as expected.
B00LXH12ZG|4|Beautifully made
B002EB06N4|4|A little big on him, even at 4 months despite other 3 month old clothes fitting well, but that's fine since he will grow into it. Like the material. Cute.
B00ARBFTI0|4|I bought this to use as a key leash inside my purse but it was way too long. I ended up cutting the cord and using the clasp with the tie that came with it.  So it's still solved my problem just not as expected. I would say cord stretches to 3 feet easily and could reach further if needed. I didn't pull on it further because I was concerned the cord would not recoil.
B00BLW2PZY|1|The picture shows a maroon color but its really a bright red, the shirt runs small and the one i received had runs, Im very dissapointed, I took pictures of how i received it,
B00BLM9LJC|5|i like. this is simple, good quality, and mad cheap. i am getting to really like this brand - imperial motion. i am getting another 1.
B004WI2C3O|5|Love these jeans. Comfortable and slimming. I feel I look very &#34;updated&#34; for a mom of 20 year old twin boys! Levi's thank-you!!!!
B00KP623ZE|5|Very comfy
B00HN2ZTAE|4|I got this product faster than expected and I was so happy when I received it that I practically tore it from the package. The fit is very nice but if you're more into loose or baggy sweatshirts get a size up. I am small/medium and this is kind of awkward to wear. the sleeves are not as long as in the picture but they aren't too short. the print of the cat face is not just print, it's a sewn in design and won't just wash off after 3 wears. (awesome) the quality is good and I would definitely buy again.
B000JHFTMI|5|This is the second one I've purchased. the first finally wore out after 8 years of wear. My son says it's the warmest coat he's ever had.
B00DCPOHH2|5|good
B009GXDG9E|5|I bought these as a Christmas gift for my mother. She loved them! She was very impressed with the design, comfort, and quality. A great set of winter socks! Would likely order them again...maybe even some for myself!
B00JXHLQJ0|5|was very soft and pretty. gave it to a friend for her birthday. she loved it.
B00UW2FJ16|1|Already have holes after a week of wear.
B00HP9S85S|5|Good
B00NILCYHA|3|I am typically an XS, however, the Small fit nicely for everyday wear (had a slightly fitted look), but was a bit too small for activewear. The drawbacks for use as a ski coat...when zipped fully, I found I had little room for head movement and the arms were too short when extended above my head.
B00BOJX06W|5|so cute!!
B003R7LD6I|5|I received these socks in the mail the other day and I can't wait for it to get colder so that I can wear them.  They are super thick all over, cozy and will be a great boot sock or pad around the house sock.  These will keep my feet warm and dry all winter.  I think I have converted to wool socks forever.
B00N1T0N8Q|3|Good quality and well made. I'm 5'2 110lbs and a 32/34 B cup. I bought a medium according to the sellers sizes.  The bottoms fit great however the top was way to large. If I recived a smaller top I would give 5 stars.
B00FFD8CO8|5|Great shirt. Fits nice.  If you tuck your shirt go one size up<br /><br />If you don't tuck get exact size.  Great shirt --  I really like them.  No cotton big deal to me --
B00GQYL8I2|5|love this top! fits perfect! not to much or to little padding. great price! i will be ordering more in different colors!
B0062R1054|5|this wallet is fantastic. i used to own a leather wallet for years and i had to change it due to discomfort while sitting in the office all day and having a big wallet in my back pocket. this wallet looks greats, made with good material, unique, etc. I am not saying its not expensive, but you will never get a good looking and handful wallet.  you get what you pay for. Totally recommend for others.
B00MAVN0R2|5|Its really good and comfortable to use.
B00KXEW6W8|5|Super, I like joe Boxer  P.J.'s
B008L422BW|5|These are definitely stainless steel. I checked them with a magnet as soon as I received them. They are sturdy and smooth and they were a great price! Ran a pair of them through the wash accidentally, and they are still shiny. None of the finish wore away, like some cheaper ones I have had in the past.
B003VVR33W|4|Size is as expected.
B00Q2GBEG0|3|I would like it better had it fit - the large was more of a medium.
B00F4D32OO|5|Bought these for my granddaughter and they fit great. They really washed up nice. And I love the fast free delivery right to my door!
B003HIJ3DM|3|It's ok. Top does roll down a bit which makes it uncomfortable after awhile. I think it's overpriced for what it is.
B000BMD040|4|Bought for my 3 and 5 year old. 3 yr old way too big. 5 yr old can where but his mouth is no where near where it should be if he can see out of it.
B00NILIMYO|4|The product didn't come on time so I have to contact the seller. They answered immediately and made another shipping that finally arrives! It looks nice and fit good. I like it
B00SO712YY|5|Good shorts, I do running in them and they work for that an i am sure other sport activity will be fine in them as well.
B00HF6B1XC|2|fake
B00KZLRXZ4|5|I absolutely LOVE this! I want it in more colors! I've worn it with a tank underneath and it keeps me so warm. It is soft inside. The quality is great! I love, love this!
B00DWN7QNQ|4|Excellent item fits well and they wash well. My son is 12 these fit perfect and are value for money
B00AKWG7Z0|5|Was a big hit
B00FUKTSH6|5|Exactly what I expected. The clip is strong enough to hold the bills. Several cards fit in the pouches. I am very glad I chose this product. It is real leather. Hope is holds up.
B005HQ7HJE|3|Doesn't fit any adult.
B00847JFMK|5|They delivered on time and the rite size and color.
B0086GE60K|2|I am definitely disappointed by the quality of these polos. They are way too thin and lightweight. They also run a bit small.
B00HHOXQP8|5|It is so well right and the color design is altohether a best
B00GTTELCE|3|Very cute, but toddlers kind of need the little built-in shorts.  This doesn't have them.
B00NL3IO8S|2|Nice but way too small. Designed more for men who are very fit looking. Very unflattering for those who are not.
B00JUMB1UW|5|Fits well and looks great, came slightly brighter than what was in the photo though.
B00KOKA7RC|5|My son loves these and wears them all of the time!
B00P2221ZS|4|Doesn't look exactly like the picture but still looks good!
B00KDFK3JA|5|All in accordance with the request
B00GGOBZD0|5|Great buy....lightweight and warm....
B003EBC9G0|5|I like the costume, was a bit small but worked ok with adjustments.  Looks just like the picture. So cute on.
B001XURK0Y|4|Great swimsuit for tall guys. Only complaint is the velcro fly that does not hold perfectly.
B000M8WA2G|4|Connects my old Nokia 6820 to my laptop. Just be aware that it emulates a COM port thru USB. Make sure you have the COM port set correctly in the Nokia PC Suite to match the virtual COM port assigned by the driver. This you can check in the Device Settings in the Control Panel. I need to set the COM port to COM16 every time I plug in the cable.    In short, the product works - as long as you are willing to put in a bit of effort. For the price, good value. And it saves me from having to turn on the bluetooth - which is slower and drains the battery faster.
B009K08AIA|5|Super cute
B0008EOFOK|5|I couldn't find my size (40W x 34L)in Lee's anywhere in the mall.  So I ordered these and they are perfect:  no flaws, high quality, great fitting heavy denim jeans.  I liked them so much that I ordered a second pair in a lighter color, and they are perfect as well.  I will continue to buy jeans this way when needed until I find reason not to.
B00M7DMJAC|5|My son needed these for wearing with his Navy uniform and he is grateful to have them and loves them!
B0077I4DDI|4|They are a bit too roomy so not as flattering as some other shorts I have of the same material type and seem you may be a bit 'flashy' using them to work out so wear some sort of compression short under. I'd still recommend them because they are good for lounging around in,.
B003KGLX9I|5|great robe.....nice quality ....
B00279I61C|5|I was looking for an american made product that was well made of quality materials.  This belt is it.  It is rugged yet fashionable and I wear a big size which also influenzed my decision.  I plan to purchase anoth[[ASIN:B0027992LU Men's Ranger Dress Belt - 1 1/2\\" English Bridle Leather Ranger Style Dress Belt]]er one.
B00M3T8CME|5|So pretty under and over tops :)
B0084ZGKTI|5|I was really nervous about buying a bra without trying it on, especially since I was not exactly sure what size I should be wearing. I have been wearing a 38 D because it was the closest thing I could find that fit locally. I have been having some back pain with my old bra, but I got this today and have worn it for a while, and it has been amazing! My bust measurements are 33.75&#34; for the rib cage, and 40.25&#34; at the largest point while wearing a sports bra. This bra is supportive, it doesn't cause boob spillage, and it makes my breasts look perky. I would recommend this in a heartbeat to anyone looking for a larger cup bra. It is overall very good quality.
B00ICPQCBQ|3|its ok
B003WY94A8|1|Can't really get too graphic here. Suffice to say, the fit in the front left little to the imagination. Bummer.
B00JM8EN54|5|I wore this to a comic convention. I got lots of compliments and picture requests. The fabric isn't very breathable so it gets a little hot but other than that, it fit well and looks great!
B00N99K6OE|3|some of these are super tight like they were messed up when they made them. the ones that aren't are great
B0007YXS6M|5|I couldn't be more satisfied. I bought this for my mom and I am happy..item reached on time..the quality is excellent and I am planning on buying more for her asap..Thank you
B00AJFSG2A|5|Nice!
B00AAQT8OS|3|it's nice. not bad. little big.<br />good quality and same as photo.<br />i like the fabric.<br />Wishes i order smaller size.
B00QT7UOAE|4|All good
B0027UB9U6|5|This was bought for a diva night party and with sunglasses I was not recognized. My daughter now wants to borrow it too!
B00HJ6P0ZI|1|I am a small person.  Usually I order clothing in XS.  I order this sports bra in XS and i can barely get it over my shoulders.  it is very tight and does not stretch
B004RJRAVW|5|These slippers are comfy and great, though if you have bigger feet they kind of slide off a lot. Also, one of the slippers has already lost his whiskers and this is the first day I've had them. Still, it's not too big a deal and they're really soft and awesome.
B005V00ED2|2|The tights fabric is good. overall i like them but, the reason why i give 2-star is because even tho the tights were the same size (as shown on tag) a pair of the ones i received was much more smaller.
B00XWC3YQA|5|Super comfy and of course they look awesome.
B00B1TOPN2|5|This dress fits exactly as the model in the picture. Nice, huh! I am a 5'0 plus size woman with a flumptious body. This covers up all the right places and is very flattering. The length hits me exactly at my ankles, the fit is somewhat loose and flows over my body without that unattractive clothes hug, that is not eye appealing at all on any figure! The chest area is perfectly fitted and hits above the cleavage and has great coverage at the underarm, so you can't see your bra. The fabric is light for hot days but because it's black, and a maxi, it can be worn all year round with the right cardigan, jacket or sweater. This maxi dress would be perfect for taller women, too. It would fit more like the model, at the mid calf. It could be worn with boots at that length! Highly recommend. Thanks!
B00KSSI6IW|5|So cute, glad I bought it one size up so it wouldn't be skin tight. Can't wait to wear it! Great price too.
B00420ATXC|5|Love this, it is the representation of my son Ransung and will always serve as a reminder of him whenever I look at it.
B00KKH1BYC|3|Fits a little smaller than I was expecting. I'm 5'4 120 with a 36 b chest and this fits tight around my chest and arms-if I hadn't had 2 kids in the past 2 years I think it would've fit better. The strings are going to take some extra care to not ruin them and the cut in the back was not as wide as expected
B00KB3I896|4|Really like it. It's adorable!
B00PXUVCWW|4|Really liked the dress but it runs large
B006V4IUMY|5|I got this Guitar shirt to wear in a video I'm doing in a couple of weeks. Love the shirt , photos doesn't do it justice.. you should see it in person , its awesome.  I will buy more shirts from this seller.
B00L60J8AG|5|This is a classic cardigan, love the fit (fit to size) and the detailing in the knit is very nice.
B005Q0E104|5|Great shirt. This was a gift. Looks just like the picture
B0073WCJ66|4|The listing did not sufficiently make clear that this was for women, not men. It was too small, returned it.
B00QRDP12Q|5|Very cute & has a little berry applique on the rear as a bonus that makes the romper extra cute.
B004H8GIFC|1|I got these pants for  for my husky grandson. Size 12h. They are so small with about a 2in flex in the waist band. I get a better fit buying regular size 12 at walmart .
B00EZHVXWS|5|My shipment came in 12 days. It fits percent and I like how well it fits me. I had chosen the wrong pants color and they were very understanding and changed my order. Overall this piece is perfect and I would recommend this item to anyone.
B0091E72DE|5|My granddaughter wanted this for Xmas and hasn't taken it off since then! It washed up perfectly and stayed fluffy- great product!
B00NMQ6PTY|5|This is a great shirt!  I got it for my son to wear for his dinosaur themed, 5th birthday party... and everyone commented on it.  The size 5 shirt fit my average 5 year old very well.  I absolutely love the front, but the back lists some facts about the dino on the front, which makes it even better!  Little pricey, but a great shirt!
B00PCV0J3A|5|Really great shirt! My husband is a third generation mason with his own contracting business and we have never seen a shirt like this. It's a vibrant color and very well made, best t-shirt saying!!
B000OTTHZ6|3|What I did like about the item that it was very supportive for my 34D breast - but 1) the cup was too big,2)  the top of the cups could be seen above my dress and 3) the sides also came up a bit too high for my particular dress and was actually a bit irritating to my underarms.
B00EYXZ4S2|5|Love it thanks
B00XT41YX6|1|It don't look like the picture . It looks like a large dress instead of a shirt in dress ... I would like my money back
B009H1S1DQ|5|good fit I received lots of compliements when I wore it, will buy more from this company, nice and comfortable
B00RCL0SCK|5|The quality is excellent and I love that it's not form fitting through the torso. It does fit a little tight in the built-in bra but it's not uncomfortable. I love the racer back because it provides additional support.
B0026RHF1C|4|good
B00AONUBDE|5|This is a very cute outfit for a little girl. I got this outfit for my niece and it's nice.
B004LQ05ZY|5|I can't say enough good things. I think I own a pair in every color they make. In California the heat can get to you wearing business clothes everyday. These pants are so light they really help keep me cool. I am in and out of cars and planes everyday and the wrinkle free aspect is really nice. The pleated look gives it a nice classy feel and the stretch waist sure feels like the pants move and stretch with you.
B003L11U9A|5|Very comfortable and supportive. I wear a size med-large clothes right now, but the snug fit of the small is good.
B00CU8CGSO|4|Very cute.  Top fits as expected for a 12 month size but it is very short!
B0063UJ0KW|4|This arrived as promised - and works well. I had planned to adjust the waist - the wearer is shorter and with a larger waist than this size - and it worked out perfectly when I shortened at the waist and changed the closure to a drawstring. The packaging gave us a start, though - it exploded from the box when opened. This is a good value overall.
B008I089UW|5|I don't normally write reviews, but I had to this time. Based on the other reviews, I took a chance on these gloves. They are beautiful and fit comfortably. Comparable gloves sell for much more. I am 5'3&#34; and these come up to just below my elbow. I used the measuring guide provided by the seller and the gloves fit well. They also arrived within 5 days, postmarked from CA. I had inquired about returns (just in case) and the seller provided a local US address. All in all, a great buy, I'll be recommending to my friends. I hope the seller continues to keep this quality and price in place!
B00NUBLT0G|3|so cute, but it's so long. I ordered XS (I'm a sz s/ m/ 3) expecting it to be big, but it was wayyyy bigger & longer than anticipated.
B00OVTN77Y|3|Got a great color selection, just had a problem with them stretching kinda weird around the calves. All in all not too bad though.
B00UDXTKJ6|4|purchased one of these from another site...  love it !!
B00IFV9H5K|5|Great Quality, as expected.
B00NI7HBC2|5|Exactly how the picture looks, very fast shipping
B00B30U7EA|5|The color is great, the butterflies are easy to see. The fit is right where I expected.
B004OA7A96|5|I bought this for our family trip to Disney and boy am I glad! It fit perfectly and it was really easy to spot our little one amidst a crowd of \\"normal\\" ponchos. It was adorable too!
B004LY57D6|3|It was an ok beard. Didn't fit very well.
B009FE0JW6|5|nice item
B00ADZMLZY|5|Perfect color and fit Love Levi's. Too bad they don't have them in white for that price. Price was GREAT!
B00NRFQD2O|3|Cute, nice material but huge for my 11 month old! How is very big!
B00HQAFU20|3|These seem to fit looser than my other bra's of the same size, but the cup size fit fine.
B00G3RW5DO|4|I bought this top in black, and it's now my favorite shirt. I planned to buy several more, but the white is the only one I can find. It's really soft and comfortable, and I love the long length. I can see that the white might be see through per other reviews, but the black is just fine, so I ask the retailer to bring back the black and other dark colors.
B00N2XL51A|5|I ordered the apricot corset and it was sent the day I ordered it and arrived today- probably a week and a half after I ordered it. Living in Alaska things ususally take longer to get shipped here but this was so fast! Object is as described and fits very well. I usually wear a large in shirts so I ordered a large and it fits great.
B00ACIHFTE|4|Fits true to size. Wears well. Washes good.
B00F2VJCQK|4|Based on the reviews I get the impression that the product delivered may vary a bit.  On mine, the outside of the lens holder unscrews and the &#34;lens&#34; is a piece of transparent red plastic about 1/4&#34; thick.  The elastic headband is cheap but would be easy to replace.  The bridge between the goggles is a bead chain inside plastic tubing.  The beads protrude inside each goggle.  The excess probably could be cut but since I have no plans to wear them over my eyes I didn't bother.<br /><br />As a costume piece these are good.  If you want wear them to see through or, heaven forbid, use them for gas or electric welding this is not the product for you.
B00265B1EQ|3|Well, you get what you pay for.  This shirt is SUPER tight around the mid-section.  I got a large because that's what I tend to wear in t-shirts.  It fits decently in the shoulders and arms which is surprising considering how ridiculously tight it is around the stomach.  I'm &#34;big&#34; guy.  I'm literally only slightly out of shape.  But this costume makes me look pregnant.
B00Q52BV1O|1|These black pants are very poor quality and are HUGE.  My son wears a 12, and these 12's came, and fell right off of him.  They are more like a size 16.  The company wants to subtract shipping from my return, and wants me to pay for return shipping.  Not honest at all.
B00B0EA4VA|4|I like it, comes in handy in cold environment and for bundling items while traveling.<br />Shrinks to 1/3rd the size in wash.  but this thing is huge when you first receive it.  I'd buy again for sure.
B007ZS57S0|4|Absolutely stunning silk blouse that is far too small by US sizing.  I ordered a 2XL, it was labelled &#34;2XL&#34; (no longer shown on the catalog page), and it is approx. size 12-14.  I'm so sad to have to return it.  The silk is a bit thin but extremely pretty.
B002G9GI40|1|I didn't like the fit of these scrubs. I felt shapeless and like I was in a sack. I'm 5' 3&#34; size 10 and these made be feel like a bag lady :-(
B00ESMSCWO|4|Its very small thats for sure.. it takes alot of work to get it on the first time.
B00MVHB7OI|5|Great way to break the ice or for lounging by the pool. When putting it on, make sure you don't have anything hanging out though.
B0014K02QM|5|These are not see through unless you are wearing fluorescent panties :)<br />Really nice soft and perfect pants.<br />They are made partly of rayon which I believe is what makes them so soft.<br />I usually wear a large but based on some reviews saying that the run larger I decided to get a medium and I'm glad that I did. The medium fits perfectly.
B00JQE0X26|5|I like it
B004WSD8ZA|5|this is a size that is a little difficult to find in the stores....<br />these fit very well and the material is the best I have found in a long time....I will be buying more!
B00EVLQ4IG|4|fall down very easily
B005DJJML6|5|This jacket is a must have, for the winter denim collection. It's so cute to wear and dress your jeans up for a trendy denim day, and keep warm all the while.
B00T89MALG|4|bought for wife, she likes it.  fast delivery.
B000KE6CM6|5|AWESOME
B005EOOWIS|3|The hat should be shaped to fit the curve of a wearer's head.  It's a straight bottom sewn onto a curved haircomb, which makes the hat bend and crease in the middle.  It also wouldn't stay on with loose hair.  I'm going to try and figure out how to attach it to a headband.
B00KDC4OBG|4|The order size is a little off.  Thanks to a review I read I ordered a size smaller than was suggested and I'm glad I did. I've only been using the corset for less than 1 week.  At first it was difficult to put on and tighten and was very uncomfortable to wear.  Took a couple of days to get adjusted.  I'm actually pleased with the corset.  I wear it at least 8 hours a day.  I tried wearing it at night but it was too uncomfortable. Some websites suggest not wearing the corset at night and others say it's ok.  I guess it's your preference.  I wear it as soon as I wake up in the morning and adjust it throughout the day (tightening/loosening).  I haven't had it long enough to see any results but I have a feeling it was worth the buy.
B00CHS5VLG|5|I love this dress! I just wish I could have found an XL in it. I'm too busty for the large and the large fit great in the hips. I love the length as well!
B001M2A53C|3|I don't like the material and so I kind of wished I hadn't bought them.  They weren't expensive though so it's not a big deal.  They came in a timely fashion so that was good!
B000E0QTX8|3|I wanted a bra that had vintage feel, but none of them seem to go down to my size. Technically I'm supposed to be a 30D or 30DD (29&#34; underbust, 24&#34; fullest bust), depending on bra style. Using the &#34;sister size&#34; system, that means that bras which are 32C or 34B should work reasonably well for me and hold similar volume of breast tissue. I may have been asking too much because the 34B in this bra fit a bit loose in the band, and I do not fill the cups at the top of the cup or down into the &#34;point.&#34; However, since the bra cup material is cotton, and the hook closures are extended out from the cotton part of the bra with a strip of elastic, I may just alter the bra. I already cut out on the &#34;eye&#34; side and then sewed the piece directly to the cotton of the bra, for a much better band fit; altering the cups would prove more tricky, but it was just a $10 bra, so if I mess up I don't care too much.<br /><br />However, the 32C in the Bali Flower bra fits like a dream, and gives me the vintage look I was after. :)
B00NI49XOE|4|NICE LEGGINGS. NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THEM. THEY ARE A LITTLE LARGE ON ME AND GO TOO HIGH UP MY WAIST, BUT I AM 5'3 107 POUNDS SO I USUALLY HAVE TO SHOP IN THE JUNIORS DEPARTMENT. I WOULD ORDER THEM AGAIN AND I LIKE THE COLOR. THEY ARE EXACTLY AS PORTRAYED,
B0008EOJBE|3|At 5'0&#34; I love finding good pants I don't have to shorten! These were a great fit. Not the sexiest, most stylish jeans in the world but for the price the fit was awesome. So 3 stars for comfort and fit, took 2 away because I can't say these were amazing. They are mom jeans! ;)<br /><br />2013 was the year I finally said enough and have been working to lose weight. at almost 60 pounds, I am trying to not buy a ton of clothes because I intend to keep losing. So I have been trying to find 2 or 3 things I can wear for a while and move on. Things I can wear through a size or 2 with a good belt :)<br />As I was making my way towards 16 I got these because they had the elastic as I wasn't totally there yet. Now I am at a 14 and these are actually too big now and are working with a belt. They are comfortable, they are warm (I live in Chicago) they are fitting the bill. Great fit. If they had these in 14 I would buy them to keep me going down.
B000VDZ9TS|5|Very useful!!!
B0010FYR0S|5|I bought both this shirt and the \\"Matthew MacFadyen loves me\\" one. He is my favorite actor, and I love the concept of this shirt. I'll switch off to sleep in them. The company is loaded with lots of other prominent \\"stars\\" for which adoring fans can display their devotion. Check it out!
B005DMGDNI|5|These are comfortable and great for sports (except biking, where they do ride up).  I hate flies in my underwear, and they have none, also the waistband is not ridiculously thick.  The pouch area is more supportive than mose boxer briefs.
B003JH8SQE|5|Used this with the white \\"Marilyn\\" dress at a party and it was a true hit! Not the most comfortable, but hey, we are not talking a real expensive wig you will wear every day, but perfect for completing the look!
B0002VNGJY|5|Great
B001ELL6B6|5|This is an excellent quality but the band is snug. Looks good with thin sportswear tops. Will probably stretch in time.
B00743PBJQ|2|Sock rolls up under the toes...would have preferred to buy by certain size instead of 7-12 size.  Would not recommend these socks unless you wear size 10 or larger shoes.
B0033ZSAI8|5|Looks very nice and hope my daughter will like it as well. But only Christmas will tell the story. Nice
B00HA4NH5O|2|Very disappointed. I would not consider this a seeraucker shirt. Seersucker lines ran an inch apart, not over all the material.
B00QHR5JVK|5|Love it!
B00FDQC6IA|5|Son loves these. I bought a couple sizes larger going on the other reviews and they fit great. My son is a strong sporty build, very muscular for an 8 year old. He usually wears size M in clothing; underwear he likes the L in Hanes and in Calvin Klein's he is wearing an XL. He likes his clothes more lose fitting. He could definitely fit the larges, but the XL fits him more the way he likes them. They are very soft and my picky son loves them. Colors are great.
B00I47XOPY|5|You cannot go wrong with Saxx underwear.  Yes, they are expensive,  but they are worth every penny.  I will not ever purchase a pair of underwear from a big box store again. The platinum line has the softest fabric that I have ever seen.  Not only is it soft, but with the little mesh insert they have inside to hold all of the goodies comfortably in place.
B004R1NHMQ|4|Fit of XL just clears 44in combined band+cup size, so size up if you aren't tiny. Fabric is soft but not sheer, though the neckline is a bit lower than the picture shows, and does require a cami underneath.
B008F4HQ00|3|I am 5-2, weigh 133 pounds and am definitely not heavy.  However, as we get older we get a midriff bulge.  I am very small shouldered but have a problem in that area.  It is not extreme but it does exist.  So, I usually have to get a medium that is large on top to accommodate my stomach area.  Manufacturers try to cut costs by streamlining their products and this is not the area where they should be doing this.  When are they going to learn?  This item fit me great everywhere but in that area.  It would have worked out fine if I didn't try to zip it or button it so what good would that be with a raincoat?  I'll bet if you took a survey of most women, many of us share of the same problem.
B00XQ01K3W|4|Order a size up.  After a couple of washings the 3T is too short on my daughter.  Her other 3T clothes are too long.  Runs small/short.  Shrinks after washing.  Material nice soft cotton.  Cute design.  My daughter's favorite pajamas.
B00ACB58MC|5|One of my favorite shirts!
B000OWGGLQ|5|Great product.  Fits great.
B0079VJYUK|3|The metal under wires started pinching a few weeks after I got this. The pinching occurs under the arm pit where the lace is sewn. Other than that it seems to be well made. I wont be wearing it though.
B00FMZF7II|5|It was a little smaller than I anticipated but I do love it
B00IS9E3S0|5|Great fit, great quality, definitely would recommend these leggings!
B00GICLT3G|5|I'm 5'3&#34; and about 150 lbs, but I don't look it, I guess. I ordered a large because of all the reviews saying things like &#34;the sleeves went up my arms when I lifted them&#34; or &#34;the bottoms rose when I sat down&#34;. I don't have those problems and definitely could have gotten a medium. The buttons are spaced so much that you can see inside if you're sitting down, and I'd recommend wearing something underneath if you have company. The tail sort of drags on the ground, and if I wear it out (which I do) and the ground it wet, I have to hold the tail up. It's not that big a deal, because the warmth, comfort, and automatic feeling I get to dance when I'm wearing it outranks any problems that I have with it.
B00CJQ37YE|5|looks great on a 5-year old ))
B000NRT7C2|5|Great product, love it. The belt fit well and looked exactly like the picture. I would recommend this to a friend.
B0026Q568C|5|Great product, great price. I bought it for my son for nerd day and it went perfectly. However it can be used for other occasion if you want. Don't blow your money on some expensive one just buy this.
B00631VHLG|5|Love it.
B00PQB9ZOK|4|Cheap, and it works perfectly, its warm and so chic it arrive in time I recomend it
B000P7YHL6|5|I loved it . I had one month of vacation at the beach and I worr that everyday when I woke up used it to go tonthe breakfast at the hotel, to go to the pool , the beach ! It was my everyday regular shorts ! Loved it
B00GQVC6HM|1|I orderd this one just because that I love the color but it is Completely different color got it and it is tea color and not yellow. So do not trust at all!
B005FOCXVK|3|This runs almost a full size too big. The material is very thin also. Would be great for a summer night?
B001O820FK|5|Beautiful made shirt! Love the design and is excellent quality! Perfect for my sons 1st birthday party!! Love it! Thank you!
B00OV9ZSSA|4|Excellent, well fitted, strong material. I couldn't ask for better. I love it!!!
B000O5228Y|5|works great in the antenna and make the statement that I am proud to be an American
B00FEAG6A4|5|I love this hoodie, I bought it for a friend in mind but as soon as I saw it I knew it was meant for my boyfriend, it is of very good quality and it looks so good on him, it is just perfect, a lot cuter than in the picture.
B004XR542U|1|Looks could be deceiving. The style looks nice but the fabric and finishing is awful. After spending this amount of money on a so called designer dress, you should be able to wear it more than once. Had I seen the dress before purchase, I would have skipped it. The beads and the sparkles started falling off as soon as I took it out of the box. The bangles in the waist line makes noise when you walk, and pulls the cheap lace fabric that the dress is made of. I took it to a dress maker to hold the top in and she even recommended I return the dress. I didn't want to loose 20 percent to shelving fees so I kept it. I usually buys my clothes at Macy' so after these I may stick to them. I expected the pleats on the top to be ironed down but they are all fluffy. I also expected a dress this price to have a better bra inlet on the top not cheap ones like this. This seller charges $23.99 for shipping yet they use a US postal service medium flat  rate box to ship it from LA. They don't even have the decency to address their buyer's issues. How in the world do they expect a consumer to spend this much money on a dress, pay extra money for alteration and be able to wear it only once.
B005VEMKV2|5|Identical to picture. Relaxed fit. Lovely colors. (I ordered pink) :) great material
B009SAEJEG|3|I wear a size 8 in pants, jeans and skirts, but these are a bit large.  They are comfortable, but are far from flattering. I have washed them and put them in the dryer several times but can not get them to shrink in width or length. I bought 2 pairs , one in a light wash and one in a dark wash, and both pairs have the same problems.  I'll wear them around the house and for yard work, but they are to unflattering to want to wear out. I know jeans fit everyone differently it's a gamble to buy on line.
B007CFJWE6|5|I am a diabetic and these socks meet the criteria that I require to stay healthy.  Also they do not fall down
B00JZIU7IS|4|Amazing look
B007BLNFWQ|2|The quality of this short seems good and the style is nice but the actual legs of these shorts are way too small! They seem cut like skinny jeans almost which is not a flattering look. If you have muscular legs these shorts will not fit.
B00B0AOR5I|5|1. the price is ok<br />2. the desire is very cool.<br />3. the size is OK<br />4. i like the sports style with such a girlish feeling.
B00ARY0RPC|3|Beware buying items from Young Hearts. even though size Tag says 3T, it fits like 2T. I have never had this kind of problems and other orders I made for 3T fitted perfectly.<br /><br />Putting that aside, the product is really beautiful.
B00TVDWSVG|5|It's the best!
B0042LJGUI|4|I have real straw hats. This isn't one of them. BUT it is fine. Looks good. And well worth the money.<br />Was crushed in the packing. Either an angry employee or a moron packed the hat, but I was able to reshape it well enough.
B00D088WQI|3|The size chart would not work. I went one size up to begin with and it was still small. I bought it for a 9 year old that wears a size<br />8-10.  I'm going to return it. I won't ask for a replacement because I don't trust the size will be correct and I've run out of time.
B00O412BNA|5|Good quality shirt. Thicker  and better than  you average junk shirts from wally world
B0007A9220|5|This is a really great backpack.  My daughter weighs 25 lbs and we use this pack at least 3 hours a week.  She loves riding in it & overall it is very comfortable to wear.  (Considering of course you are carrying a child on your back)  The product is designed so it doesn't \\"soak\\" my back with sweat & I have no trouble putting the pack on and taking it off with my daughter in it.  Definitely buy the rain/shade cover.  She has fallen asleep in the pack & the cover adds additional support for her head, as well as keeps her protected from the elements, but still allowing her to enjoy the outdoors.
B004QY6N48|5|Excellent
B00VB01S86|5|LOVE IT!!!!!!
B008COISGO|5|This is such an awesome crown.  It's rubber, but it looks so real, fits great, great construction.  Held up through my whole party.  I would highly recommend!
B00S1S6XI6|5|I'm in love with this product fits beautifully
B00U776S1G|5|The fit and construction are great.  Easy to adjust up and down for different length dresses and makes a fantastic finish for a flared dress.
B00MYGEN8I|4|Love the shirt but it ran small so I have to order another hoodie
B00PACA86O|4|Simply stated, this brief makes a man look like man, with perhaps more than God gave him!  I do greatly miss the Elance Bikini.  It is simply the best brief ever made and makes every man look bigger than real life.
B00LS26A8A|5|So far, these are the best suspenders I've found. Price wise, durability, and looks. Like someone else had mentioned, NO leather patch sewn into the cross in the back of the suspenders, to irritate your back if you wear the suspenders under your shirt. VERY hefty double pinned clasps for guaranteed NO SLIP support. The clasps are a bit larger than on other dress suspenders, but they really lock onto jeans or dress pants, and don't slip. No problems with rust on any of the clasps after washing. Over all, a very good buy. Have bought several pairs.
B000J3AWU6|3|I bought these as they looked cute and the price couldn't be beat. I will most likely buy again BUT, the price isn't the only thing that is cheap about these. After the first wash, one of them starting spliting at the side seam. They don't 'ride' up too bad either.
B006PHXUOU|5|So I bought this as a gift for my dad and he loves it. A week later he found out that there was a loose piece on the hinge therefore making it not close well. I emailed the sharkk at amazon customer service and they were very helpful. They quickly responded and sent me a new one. Thanks
B003IXBLRW|5|These are the ComfortSoft Classic tees and they are the best Hanes tees I ever owned. The weight is not too low, as is often the case these days, the fit around the body and neck is perfect and holds up very well over time. The heathered color gets a little lighter but I kinda like that. I wish I could find this very same model in other colors but so far no luck.
B00CHFBRMQ|5|Very good product and quality. delivery as described
B00B4EYE94|5|Great tie for work and special occasions. Reasonable priced.
B00394DMAO|5|All women know that it is hard to find a perfect fit, even in the store, but this is a good buy. High quality and comfortable. Looks great, and is versatile depending on the shirt you are wearing straps can be adjusted or removed easily, and bra remains in place, even when worn strapless. The price is excellent, I would not have been able to buy this in the store at a lower price, even with shipping cost added.
B008AJZPTO|5|Fits perfectly and looks great! Definite essential for fall. My boyfriend loved it. Great color, great look, and best price for a namebrand fleece.
B005C9FTUK|5|I love this garter belt so much!! It's super cute and comfortable and the price was amazing for the quality.
B00EVO5XQC|5|As many have mentioned they are practically unnoticeable when they're on.  Incredibly comfortable, and a whole lot of sexy.  I originally purchased the grey bikini style... got them... wore them... and immediately ordered the bikini in white and the briefs in black.  I find them to give you a sense of freedom, yet are supportive in a very natural feeling way.  I would even go further and say that you actually feel a certain sexual confidence wearing them.<br /><br />I am so glad I did not delay in ordering them as they seem to be quickly purchased... obviously I was not the only person to realize what a great product was being offered at such a great price.  Try them... and you may see/feel what I'm talking about.
B004EFX1KI|5|I purchased the umbrella for my 6 year old granddaughter who wanted her own umbrella for her birthday. She was ecstatic with the present and greatly envied by her two old sisters. Lovely art-quality butterfly photos.
B000K6C66K|5|Excellent fit, warm, and the price was right!
B00192WU42|5|Great for my husband!!
B00LFN0KOC|3|We got it early but i'm 5'4 154 pounds. it went above my belly and the panties are small to. It looks somewhat like shown. And no thigh highs come with this. Personally not worth while to buy. Spend more money and find something nicer in a store not online.
B00MO60OG8|5|Keeps my head and ears nice and warm.
B00CXVEHTE|5|Got this 3 days ago. It does run a bit small so you might want to size up unless you're very skinny. The little padding does provide a fuller look and that's what I was expecting. It is a bit thin and see thru.<br />Overall I'm very happy with my purchase and can't wait to wear it to my date with the hubby!
B00EZTKX7C|5|I think this shirt speaks for itself to how most women think about their future husband if he was a pro baseball player.
B00EDTO1KO|2|I ordered the size i normally wear but they were a big baggy in the upper thigh area and i dont like that. they will be in the back of my closet now.
B00I4R4GUG|4|Nice shirt
B00M2HQ4MC|5|It looks like exactly the photo. It fits very well for me. Although you have to wrap the top yourself, since the top part is just a long piece of fabric, it's still really cute for a cheap price. I love it!
B004ZP2REI|2|I ordered this shirt with high hopes and though it arrived when expected the actual collar will only fit that of someone with a basketball for a neck, its almost like a crop top for girls, its that bad.
B00N9GX2IE|2|I bought this cap for my niece . It was really cute and liked the colors, but it fit really  tight across the back of her head . She couldn't stand the  pinching. So I'll be retuning it.  She doesn't have a lg. head.
B00TZ98CQ6|4|Super cute, but I had to give away as the wool itched my skin
B00JMXTRZU|5|Comfortable and stretchy.  I would order this again.  Fits well.  Did not shrink with washing and drying.  Thats a plus.
B00A9ME76C|5|As described
B00KPD05NE|1|The color is dull, not vibrant like the picture. The brim is bent do to being rolled up to ship. Glue is on the outside of the band.
B00THWIDLA|4|Good for the price.  Fits a bit small when worn the first time.  I recommend one size bigger if you don't like the snug feeling.
B00NJ5OJL4|4|I am a size 14 and 5'8 and ordered the large and it fit well.  I was happy with the dress.  At that price it is obviously not made of an expensive fabric, but it was fine for date night.
B00B803Z8A|1|Too long
B004FPYHE6|2|too small
B00D8SS6DY|5|I bought this for my boyfriend, he wears it to work everyday. Reversability is a plus. the hat fits as expected.
B00EP0RXSS|5|I ordered this to protect/organize my handbags and it has worked out better than I ever imagined. Everything is well placed. I used to be afraid to put pens and pencils in my bags fearing the ink may leak or the lead may mark up the interior of my expensive handbags. Now I feel safe keeping a pen in my bag. Many compartments to keep everything organized and neat. Now when I switch handbags I just remove the liner with the contents and place it in the next handbag. Love, love, love it!!!!
B00T36SYFU|5|Fits great! I love it!
B001AQWK9M|5|These are a great price and fit perfectly. I wanted some comfortable underwear to wear around the house and these are great. If you prefer something that is tighter and more fitting than this is not it. If you want something that is comfortable than these are perfect.
B004C3V4CO|4|small, but a nice size for your id, money and lipstick/chapstick. came way sooner than what was listed on invoice. lots of colors to pick from. i picked a neutral color.
B0068XZ080|5|really comfortable and the design on the back is great!
B00C6YOT3C|5|Fits wonderfully. I bought it for my boyfriend as a gift and he loves it!
B001RFI356|5|I was a little worried when I was ordering the belt because of the low price. But this belt is quality! It is thick leather and supple. I would definitely recommend.
B00M3Z7EKE|1|Not the dress
B009IS9I7G|1|Do NOT buy. I'm a size 11 and its comical these are considered &#34;no show&#34;. They show up in my all my boat shoes and not just a little bit; they are clearly visible. They are practically visible even in my sneakers.<br /><br />Again, DO NOT BUY.
B00A1S0AWO|3|They are a little bit too small. If I dry them in the dryer they will shrink. I should have bought a bigger size.
B009GVHFAC|4|This helped keep my hair in place, which is exactly what I needed it to do. I did use this with Bobbie pins.
B005Z53FBG|3|the wrist band is too small , therefore I can not wear this watch . oh well , i liked this watch a lot just to small for me
B0080C71KM|4|These socks are great, they actually stay on my babies feet.  They can be a little tight around the ankle but my little guy doesn't seem to mind.  They run a little small (or my guy has big feet?)  He is 9 months and the 12-24 months are perfect.
B000FZVUK4|3|They run small. I would suggest going up a size. Bought for halloween did not end up wearing it. if they fit they would be nice though
B008D5GF76|5|just what I was looking for, my daughter's  birthday and she loved it.  Good price, shipped quick.  Nice color and fit..
B00AQGE1FI|4|I looked at similar cufflinks in a shop which were $50; same material, same look - just 5x more expensive than these. That should just about answer it. Also, they're not too big.
B00I354GHM|5|Love it!
B009GPJZN8|5|I love these jeans!!!! They sit at your true waist so there comfort level is amazing!!!  Just enough stretch in them to hug your curves but not stretch out so they keep the shape without looking baggy!!!!  It's true, if you are a size 4....order a size 2!!!!!  These are the only jeans I buy anymore!!!!!
B0031U0QBO|5|What we were looking for- my boyfriend said these are good for what he needs...to keep his pants on when he wears a toolbelt.
B0081GILHO|5|We bought this in hopes that it would fit our 3 year old son. It's a perfect fit and will pro. be good for another year. Our 3 yr. old has the head size of a 4+ . It would definitely be too big for a baby.
B00F6ODCI2|4|item is as described
B00JXRTJMQ|4|i sent my girlfriend this shirt from A.I.T and she really enjoyed it. she wears it to school and walks around proudly. The part that reveals the chest is slightly large so it is some what revealing, so the shirts run alittle large in that aspect.
B00JJ5B83K|4|I've had it seven days, okay so far.
B00128KJA0|5|I was fitted professionally a few weeks ago for bras. Much to my surprise, my accurate size was a 38G. Well thank you to all of you reviewers who advised ordering a size up. I ordered a 40G and it was the correct fit for me, both in band and cup size. I am debating on whether to order a whole shipload of these to use as my everyday bras. And why? Sure beats the 60 dollars and prices up I paid for my new underwires. And did I mention underwires? This bra has none, and what a comfort it is to have support without the nagging underwires there all day to remind me of \\"my support\\". I am very pleased with the quality and wish I had found these before I spent a small fortune on underwires. But, since I do a lot of walking in the park, I will order some more of these since this bra does not give me the uniboob like my Champions, etc. do. I am glad I found this bra.
B000MX3O4E|5|Best bra ever, I do not like underwire so this is just the one for me
B001UHN2BG|5|I had bought my husband a robe several years ago of such good quality. When it came time to replace it, I could not find a simple cotton robe. Everything was fluffy and heavy, but it was all that we had to choose from in our small shopping choices. We live in the South and it's hot. I got tired of seeing him sweat in that fluffy robe.<br /><br />When I saw this robe, it was reasonably priced. Also, I read the other reviews and that was very helpful to me. It is just the right \\"weight\\" for our area. He likes it very much. Just washed it today. Looks like it has held up so far. Don't trust it in the dryer, will air dry.<br /><br />Overall, he's satisfied, and I think I \\"done\\" good. Reviews are very helpful.
B001KXETZ8|5|These socks are great to wear around the house. They are very soft with non skid bottoms. I have worn them a lot and they have held up well. Worth the price, I think. And, yes, all the bows fell off right away. But, there is still a pretty lace around the edge.
B008DNXCDI|5|Great.
B00A219DHS|4|I love them.  Fit perfectly
B00SJA33UM|5|I love it
B00EU6ICBE|1|I am 44 years old, never been told I have  big head - regular winter hats or baseball caps always fit me, but this is NOT made for an adult.  I couldn't even push it on my head it was too tight.  Very disappointed
B00L1C0VZK|5|It's my new favorite hat, it's perfect!
B003H6KHPC|5|This product worked great under my dress for a wedding. No pantie lines to deal with and smoothed out the hip and tummy area.
B00P68SOJU|5|Great product
B00CGJTLNU|5|Perfect for totally blocking out that hot Texas Sun.  Light weight, light color.  Laundries well & air drys quickly.
B008AYJKYK|5|Bought these as a gift for a thirteen year old. If you know a thirteen year old, they probably love Minecraft, so these are a pretty safe bet as a gift. She put them on her backpack and I imagine that it made all the other thirteen year olds super jealous. I asked her this and she rolled her eyes at me. Kids, right?
B00198JRXS|2|After doing much research on quality undershirts (not the big box store kind) it was concluded that  2(x)ist would be the best bet for my needs.  I ordered it (3 pack-white) and got them very quickly (thank you Amazon).  HOWEVER, I was highly disappointed with the shirts.  To start they are NOT as soft as I have seen other manufacturers produce such as Calvin Klein (YES i did wash them a few times) and they have a certain thickness that makes it NOT comfortable to wear as an \\"undershirt\\" (under a dress shirt)  They probably would be fine if you were to wear them on their own.  Also, the shirt is very short.  Sizing was fine but the length would just reach my belt area and would untuck after the first lean over. The V-neck is larger than most shirts which was fine with me.  Just wanted to add this for anyone trying to decide prior to purchase. Back to the work of trying to find a thin soft quality undershirt!!!  Maybe American Apparel.  The day after I ordered I saw the price drop $9 dollars from Amazon which didnt sit well with me either.
B0077CSDTO|5|All my tops are flexibles! I love this top.<br />Missy
B003VRXPHY|5|My baby is 3 months old. She looks absolutely adorable with this headband. It does sit well on her head, doesn't bother her.
B0016MNH7Y|4|Although i love the shirt it's a pretty generous XL almost XXL - otherwise 5 stars
B006ZYWOY0|3|Costume was successful with the addition of the hat, and the stars on the collar of my frock coat. I thought the hat would be a darker grey. The stars were actually a little larger than I thought they would be.  I used two stars on each side of the collar, designating Lieutenant Colonel, instead of three, full colonel.
B00EPDXPV4|4|Dress is adorable. Arm openings are a bit small but otherwise a great dress.
B003XT4EQQ|5|I'm a mother of a 3 year old son and I must say my body hasn't been the same since I gave birth to him. This bathing suit is able to hid all of my body's imperfection and it makes me look good again! not cheaply made either. It's worth every penny mothers. so go get this bathing suit! you won't regret it!!!
B00WDUE5C4|4|The shorts fit really well around the waist but the leg parts are rather big. You can see most of the diaper when sitted.
B00817M1SI|4|It's what I thought it would be... VERY small for a &#34;one size fits all&#34;.  That said, my friends and I all fit into it somehow, across a range of sizes.  It's a bit see through so we wore black tights, and as a group costume I thought it was pretty cute, we got a lot of compliments.  Also, the price was right :)
B0097B6SYU|4|I was skeptical about the mask due to reviews on various others, but it actually look very authentic. The only thing I saw that was kind of iffy is the hair. the hair looks very real, and authentic. Although it sheds with a light of the hand. Still a good item to have for displays, and wearing. I would not recommend wearing much though due to the shedding. But a quick Halloween night round would hold up, and then back to the display rack. :) Overall, i give it a thumbs up for horror lovers, and Halloween fanatics such as myself.
B00E9QZQ0A|4|Loved the bra needed that size due to having had breast cancer
B00ITI5EBA|5|Great Price
B00JTOX9D8|5|cool
B00NNDX6T8|4|I was worried the sleeves were going to be too tight and the dress too short but it fit well. Cheap material and the sleeves are east to snag but it's cheap so what do you expect
B00C2OC8RK|3|sexy styling but the stripped fabric on the sides of the bottom are just tied on.<br />the clasp on the top releases easily.  doesnt contain large chest well
B00C6U1SEE|5|These ears are the coolest Mickey ears I've seen! They're huge but they fit comfortably.
B00E0IYJEG|3|Nice socks for the price. Great for winter in the desert. Why is this text box forcing me to write more words? They're just socks. Seriously.
B0095D1H2S|3|The waist elastic is a bit loose fitting. Not sure if all will have this problem. Ok for the $4 I paid for them.
B0011D2FL2|4|These underwear are a good value for the price  nothing spectacular about them, nothing wrong with them! Just what can one say about cotton underwear
B00T3REY6W|5|If you want a roomier lightweight jacket this is a wonderful purchase.  I would, however, buy a size larger if you want to wear a lightweight sweater or sweatshirt underneath.
B00FGJQ6OO|5|I love this shower curtain! it actually looks better than this picture portrays
B0009GCAIU|3|This runs  a little small and I think once washed it will be a problem other than that it is pretty good.
B00E4NR138|5|I bought these for my daughter since girls pants are thin and don't hold up to our active lifestyle. She needs pants that can withstand the woods. They are a little long  for her short legs but she will grow into them and I can roll them up. The width can be adjusted - love that
B007IRCD2G|5|I bought this dress for my daughter's 1st birthday. The layers & detailing on the dress make it super cute & trendy but young & whimsical. It reminds me of what a modern princess would wear. The picture makes it look like it comes with little shorts but they were bloomers, still adorable otherwise. I definitely recommend it for little fashionistas!
B004NINTGM|5|Good quality for use in early childhood classroom.
B00KNTRHYU|5|I love it
B00K1BDL6I|5|Perfect and soft
B00QEDMV40|5|My brother loved it!! Shipped in a timely manner!! Thanks
B004QJNPOE|4|There was absolutely nothing wrong with them. They arrived on time and in great condition. I was just hoping they were a little bigger and not, for lack of a better word, floppy. But for the price they will work just fine! Thank you!
B00IHPLJ50|1|I am a small woman, 5 feet 3 inches 110 pounds. And it is to small. I ended up giving it to my 9 year old niece!!
B000LSOQ9W|1|When looking at a picture of this shirt, the pocket cannot be seen and how many people under 70 want a pocket on their golf polo shirt
B005Y36UFW|4|husband loved it..
B00ONAF8LY|5|Bought these for my son prom an he loves them.
B00X8WQS44|3|I was so excited to get my shirt in the mail I order a 3 x but it fit like  xl
B00I0IZUB8|5|I was a little afraid of this jacket. I thought it would be too small, cheaply made, or just look stupid on me. However, when I got it I just about crapped my pants.<br />This thing will make you look like a sexy French dude. The ladies won't be kissing your toes, but you can guarantee some other parts will receive she-mouth contact.<br />Like big women? No problem. They can rough up this jacket like it's a box of twinkies as much as they please, because you could get hit by a train in this jacket and it would still look nice.<br />This jacket was delivered exactly on schedule, and I almost left it outside to be scavenged by neighbors because I thought it was my ex-girlfriend at the door. Ex-girlfriends are usually more punctual than packages in my experience, but this time that wasn't the case. An upside to expecting my ex-girlfriend? I already had a knife in hand when I opened the door, so tearing into my new package was easy.<br />I ordered a jacket from some jerks in China before this. My size choice was not saved, so it was ordered as a small. They took about a week to package it, so during that week I emailed them, asking them with diction that was so sweet it could be used by a 10 year old girl scout, if they could at least put a larger size in that package. They basically responded with a middle finger and shipped it off. It's going to be here in a few months, and when I get it I'll look like Will Ferrel in the Elf.<br />TheLees were a good rebound. They were quick to give it up, and there were no size problems. However, if there were, I'm sure they would fix them. And cook dinner every once in a while too.<br />I don't recommend that anybody buy one of these jackets. Really, what are you going to do with just one? You need just about all different versions of it to truly be satisfied. If you get just one, it's going to suck when you wear it one day and are forced to wear an inferior jacket the next day because of that white mark near the bottom that you gave it when you looked at yourself in the mirror. 10/10 good job.
B00K1XY3ZO|5|nice polo. BUT I think i buy the wrong color.
B004BX90FI|1|I love the style of the swimsuit dress.  It is my first swim dress, which I bought for occasions when I want a little more coverage of my legs, etc. I would buy something similar again, but without the decorative piece on the front.  I washed it separately and inside a garment bag in the washing machine and half of it came apart where it was glued on with some cheap glue. Don't bother buying it if you plan to wash it in a machine.  I won't ever buy another suit with something like that on it.
B008L1ZL8G|5|Nice looking and well<br />Crafted checkbook. Does the job for good price.
B000P55154|5|Been wearing a &#34;T&#34; under my shirts now for 70 plus years. Fruit of the Loom has been that &#34;T&#34; for at least 50. Still a good value. Fit well, Comfortable, I'm sure I'll get  another 5 years out of these.
B005GNWCV6|4|Google &#34;somethingturquoise&#34; on the web.
B00K9FZMSQ|4|excelente
B004P1HXQY|5|good service very good afternoon I hope to continue to improve every day more
B00B58TWZK|4|I only gave this item 4 stars because while they are well made these pants are a little too baggy for my taste, although I still wear them.
B00AAHN7US|4|I like the variety of colors this packet provided. Not the highest of quality, but pretty decent.
B00GXWTCOY|5|Good quality and it was such a good price. May get this as a gift for someone else....that's good!
B00JST8LVO|5|Awesome shirt. Timely deliver and fits excellent.
B00QEXGZ42|5|I am a 32DDD and a size 10 fit perfectly.
B00AX4GHX2|1|Color is wrong for me, doesn't fit very good,the length and curls are nice took a long ye to ship
B00LUWA3F4|5|Love it so much space
B00L3EUPPC|5|a MAJOR bargain! I got this through an Amazon lightening deal for a mind-boggling price! I still can't believe I got a $165.00 Anne Klein DOWN coat for $18.99!! Are you kidding me?!<br /><br />The coat fits great.  I wear a size 10 or 12 and ordered the large. It fits like a glove, but there's definitely not room for a bulky sweater, but that's okay! For $18.99, I'll wear a blouse or thin sweater when I wear this coat. 😊 The knit storm cuffs are great. I always have problems with sleeves being too long and the knit cuffs keep the sleeves where they need to be so they aren't too long. The side pockets are nice, the knit collar is wonderful because the zipper zips it up around your neck where it'll keep you toasty warm in a snow storm. I LOVE the faux fur hood too! It can be adjusted to be tight or loose and will be great when it's snowing and the faux fur looks great. I really like this coat! A LOT.<br /><br /> Thank you for the bargain Amazon!
B00BN102YE|5|Wouldn't know its not leather. Very handsome accessory for the price.
B008NCYBJ8|4|Quality is good for the price. It fits well for my wife. She wore it a lot when she was pregnant.
B00D7WFN5K|5|I have been a front-pocket wallet person for over 12 years now. My last one had gotten bulky and clogged up with so many cards that I had to keep them all in there because the leather was perma-stretched. This one is thin and the leather was tight. This allowed me to downsize my carrying to just insurance, credit, debit, store, and a couple ID cards, maybe 15-20 in all. It is so much smaller and lighter than my last one that I sometimes forget it is there and have to check for it.
B009NOJTBA|3|The closure in the back is really strange. I sent it back because it was too small, but I didn't order a larger size because of the odd closure.
B00XXSXNVO|5|beautiful fit!
B00JY7TJOI|5|The dress is absolutely gorgeous! It looks exactly as in the pictures, elegant, very good quality and well made. Be sure you are buying from Angel Bride, because it is the original seller and I had a very good experience with them, who kept in touch with me periodically and solved all my doubts. They asked my exact measurements and it fits me perfect. The use of a ribbon instead of a zip in the back permits you can adjust more exactly the dress. I am amazed the dress arrived many days before the estimated date... It took a little more than three weeks, and I am in Chile, Southamerica. I am totally delighted with my purchase, specially considering price and quality. I was afraid about buying this article online, but now I can recommend it with confidence.
B00EOMA3CK|5|So this was my base to make a personalized Christmas sweater and it worked great.  I personally wouldn't want to be with a dude that wore this just as it was... because it's... well... yeah.  BUT if you love the way it looks and think you would look super snazzy in it it's a great buy.  I think it looked better with a race car and checkered flags all over it but hey, to each their own.
B00KZ9XK1M|5|It came in 24hs!!! And I love it, super stretchy, fits anybody
B002HTWV90|4|I purchased this gavel to use at our monthly meetings because for the price and type of gavel I wanted, it is exactly what I was looking for - didn't need to have an engraved gavel.  Good choice for those that want a gavel that is inexpensive and durable - the wood quality is very good!
B00PODHIB2|5|Im a small person, but in the waist fits perfectly, and the fabric its just amazing. Totally buying it again
B00DHE8XEQ|5|I'm 5'11 so ordering clothes can be tricky. I'm more on the medium size but I ordered this in a Large so it will be long enough. Not only is it long enough the material is soft on your skin and heavy enough that it drapes just right on my body.
B00FX96PO8|5|bought these for my son for my wedding and fits perfectly
B00BU1ZGM0|5|Just what I was looking for.  True sizing.  Perfect fit and comfortable
B00B5WK7IC|3|I measured the bag and it is no where close to the posted measurements.  It is 19 inches across and it is way bigger than any purse that I have ever owned.  If I ever find the need to take the kitchen sink I will have a bag to carry it in.  However, I do like the color and style of it.
B0085HKRBC|5|Was perfect - used for 19 mos old at beach kept sun off his face - I would recommend this product
B00SFHV9KU|5|I'm 5'0&#34;, 100 pounds, B cup, and got the 38.  It's perfect.  The little skirt gives the illusion of curves, which is great.  The skirt will obviously fray easily, so that's something I'll have to be careful about, but the quality for the price is outstanding.  Cups are padded.  I do have to frequently adjust them because they want to ride up; I wish there was some kind of grip there.  If I let out the neck tie to lower the top to remedy this issue, it sort of sags in an unappealing way, so I'll just deal with it.  I love the color (it's more of a pinkish red, not a true red).  One caveat though - if you are short-waisted it will gap slightly on the sides in the back under the second tie.  But I don't care, I'm going to wear it anyway. For those that care, the skirt does not completely cover your rear end - it is a little flirty and you can see the bottom half of your cheeks (just like in the picture).  Someone with an ample bum might not be as thrilled about it.  Ruched waist covers any kind of small tummy pooch, which is nice since I've had two kids; there's no dedicated control tummy panel though.  I don't know if it will keep its color after being in the water, but it doesn't matter because I don't get into the ocean!  Looking forward to wearing this on my vacation to the beach.
B00IA10SXA|5|Came quickly and greatly enjoyed
B00LTG6U76|4|Was a little bigger than I expected. Really cute shirt, the coloring is not as bright as the picture appears.  Also the back is plain white.
B004WAXDX0|1|Very disappointed. It fits amazing, but is completely see through.I can see my nipples, and every tattoo through it, it also feels cheap and looks like something I cut up without taking time and tied together. Will be returning.
B0029ZC7AA|5|Great product to minimize the skin exposure to the cold.
B00IZNMEXK|5|Love the color and fit!
B00LGL2G1I|5|I bought one in green and another for my boyfriend in red, I love this shirt and I wear it a lot. It still looks great even though I've had it for maybe 2 years now. I probably wear this shirt way to much but its such a fun shirt to wear. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and I'm very happy that its lasted me such a long time. Fabric is good and the decal is still in good condition.
B00LEU5MHG|4|This tshirt is of gr8 quality but I bought a large which I usually wear n it fit a bit big . I don't understand that because I checked the measurements but I guess that's what happens when u gamble. Online purchases of clothes is sort of a gamble. Some measurements are slightly off because it's not like I can loose or drop that much size to cause that much of a difference in a matter of a couple days. N not change my eating habits. All n all good quality t-shirt. Maybe my error.
B002Q0TL7K|5|Seemed wildly popular!
B00JKSS3Z2|5|Looking for light travel shorts, found them.  Half  the weight of cotton, wash and dry very quickly.  Almost wrinkle free, will purchase another pair.
B0048MEJDU|4|This belt is solid. I did not have any sharp edges on the one I received. The belt does not slip if you use it correctly. The belt does run big. I was counting on that when ordering. I ordered the XL for a 48\\" waist and it fits great, it will actually fit a much larger waist if need be. I did notice that in ordinary jeans the belt has a little trouble when you get to the part where the soft Velcro is sewn on to hold the extra belt back. Not an issue though, it could be pulled through. I would order this belt again, but don't think I will need to, it seems very durable. I can't wait to use it camping.
B005XLTIQI|5|Really nice. 5'6 215 size XL - I carry my weight all over and these fit dead on! I just had a baby so now I'm fighting muffin top and weird saggy belly all the time. These aren't magic leggings but at least cut out the muffin top issue. They were maybe one inch too long but it's workable. Trust and buy!
B000N8Q0R6|5|I've bought several different brands of pocket tee's and I can honestly say these are the best value for the money. They fit well and the material seems to be somewhat denser or thicker than some of the others, like Hanes or Fruit of the loom.
B00J5H82PE|5|I love Hue sleepwear! I love their waist band ties that have the inspiring words! This pair has it!<br /><br />I have been wearing Hue for years! I bought these in medium and they fit great! I pair them with a black v neck sleep shirt and it is adorable! Very comfortable and very soft! I always let the waist ties just hang down to add more color. The pants have an elastic waist so they are not going anywhere.<br /><br />One thing, most Hue sleepwear is shipped on a hanger in plastic. I am guessing since these were capris and not pants, they decided not to. Mine arrived folded up in a plastic bag. Just wanted fellow Hue fans to know if you were gifting it, it is not in the same packaging.<br /><br />Still adorable and very soft though! I am glad I bought it!
B00AHRDSTQ|5|Call me a weirdo. I don't care. They fit well. Very comfortable. Better then any male briefs I ever worn before.
B00EVLUXMO|5|As described. Very happy
B007WAT8IG|5|It's is just like the image, good material, very beautiful, although I don't use it as a dress, more like a long shirt. It's very comfortable and sweet, my friends loved it!
B00LHOWNA8|5|Great belt, fantastic quality
B00CIZT7J0|5|So wonderful and comfortable. No rolling or punching up. Just perfect.
B00BJDLX12|5|I thought it was a little on the snug side, but it's cut in a way that is flattering, even if it is form-fitting.  I really like the fabric because it's nice for layering and isn't too heavy.  It's good quality and washes up beautifully.
B0088XZF8S|1|Heavy cotton<br />Over sized<br />$10 to ship a $20 T-shirt<br />Should have sent it back
B00UF7XUTG|5|I absolutely love this blouse! It is cool and light and very comfortable. I have not washed it yet and plan to wash on gentle cycle and air dry. It's feminine and has a flattering fit. It's what I call a &#34;feel pretty&#34; blouse. I recommend it!
B00VXXAJZE|5|I have a hard time believing the other reviewers actually bought and use this. It is crappy quality. I seriously regret wasting my scarce money on this. I could have spent less for better quality.  Update: Contacted the seller and was sent a new collar with softer leather and.... I LOVE IT. The seller is amazing and I will be buying more collars!
B00CRAREIM|1|Product was not the size it should've been according to the size chart.
B00LIWRE2Q|5|Looks more better in person so beautiful. Fits my daughter perfectly she loves it
B00H8AG1WQ|4|I am a deputy sheriff and I wear these every shift. They do their job by keeping my shirt tail tucked in and pulled down tightly. But, after a couple weeks of using them, the thread holding the shirt clips could no longer take the abuse. So I pulled all the clips off and sewed them back on using strong power pro fishing line. Now they work perfectly. After several foot pursuits and numerous fights, the clips always seemed to stay attached. except for one time then the lower sock clip detached. That's only because I did not have it properly secured. I suggest when first receiving these, reenforce the shirt clip thread.
B005OFSJZY|4|Good quality. The velcro back is loud sometimes though.
B005NJXQS6|5|This skirt was a perfect fit and length. The material was of a good quality allowing the skirt to flow freely.
B0042RNSCE|5|The gloves are a little longer than the picture, which is fine because the title states &#34;elbow length.&#34; They fit my dainty little hands perfectly and are stretchy enough on the end to fit right at the elbow without them falling down. Well worth it for any occasion gloves are necessary, even protecting your hands from sun damage while driving!
B0039GLS62|5|I love them and have ordered more.
B00AAMOLRG|5|I really like them
B00HUAV0MK|5|Was a gift to someone and he loves them!
B001RD5WU2|4|Cute little button. Great for beginner collectors. Colors are bright, colorful. Packing was very nicely done for such a small item.
B00FLXE9NA|5|Order my hat, and within 3 days it was delivered. Great quality product fits perfectly and it's very comfortable. Could not ask for better service!
B007D4ANEE|5|love it
B00NI2RH1W|5|This sweatshirt is so beautiful and so comfortable! It showed up earlier than the delivery estimate even in a blizzard! love love love it!
B008BVK16I|5|PERFECT GIFT
B008OR78NS|3|to small but will eventually mold to my skin.
B00EOM9VUU|5|It looks good and fits just right! My husband is very happy with it and I think it is a great choice for him.
B00EYYFQQG|5|Great shirt. I love Jones New York shirts, look great, dressy but not over the top.<br />very highly recommend it.
B002RV9QKA|2|I ordered the 32ff because the 30ff in another freya bra I bought was slightly too snug in the band on the farthest hook and I had a bit of spillage over the top of the cups.  I'm between 30.5-31&#34; around.  This bra is too loose on the tightest band setting and even though I ordered the same cup size as my other freya (penache tango II) the cups seem too big.  Only reason I'm keeping it is to grow into it during pregnancy.  The straps are set quite wide on the shoulders which causes some ackward tenting out away from my armpit area.  Also it's not as &#34;plunge&#34; as I thought from the picture.  The gouge comes up around 2.&#34;  Quality seems fabulous and the cups would be quite seamless if they weren't sticking out away from my body under shirts.
B00MWCWJIU|4|Love it! Just as expected & looks just like the picture!
B00FHO7RUU|2|Too big.
B00NNV07LK|5|nice and soft
B00MJABBNO|4|Perfect gift for Granny! Love it. Looks just like the picture.
B00CAMQ9XI|4|I found the top to be cute and it fit well, 36D got a large! There is no support, so woman with implants would love this! You could always wear over a bikini top at a pool party, it's sexy off the shoulder!!!
B00UZXJAE4|5|Beautiful dress and fit nicely, it was just a heavier fabric than I expected.  I would have been very uncomfortable during an August wedding.
B00KIXTFPA|5|I'm 5'3 and 140 pounds. I ordered a small (because I'm light on the too half of my body). It fit perfectly as a dress, and it was very soft! As a skirt, I would half to wear wedges or heels (but I'm short!). I'm going to buy more soon in different colors!
B00QD8IP46|5|Beautiful tie, I have a few of them now, and will get more. Lots of colors to chose from.
B00L2T5ZZS|5|wonderful I love them!
B00IEZ0YFO|3|its okay for the price wouldnt pay more then 5 for it you can tell its cheap was kind of hard putting it on
B00EDOA28O|5|I bought this t-shirt for my sister's 50th birthday and she loved it!  Even though it says 100% PRESHRUNK cotton, it does shrink more.  She normally wears a medium, but I purposely bought a large and washed/dryed before giving it to her and it did shrink in the dryer to a good size.
B00N24KLC8|1|Get rid of this RACIST shirt this man MURDERED THOUSANDS of innocent people
B00BYFH5IU|5|Very, very, very beautiful dress. Nice color and beautiful shine. My daughter turned 4 yr. and got this dress as a birthday gift, I ordered her a size 4, even thou she is petit size, it was good on her. I would buy more dresses for her later from this company/this brand. I love the way it's made. Very beautiful!
B00C6WT5RE|1|Greatly disappointed in the quality of this product. The back seams came out after two wearings. We have so many problems with clothing purchased from this site that we are wondering Amazon is selling factory seconds. We have been buying from Amazon for five years and the quality just keeps going down.
B00FZR1CIW|5|Comfy fit and love the variety.
B007F6BJGG|5|I bought this for my baby, it is very beautiful but it runs small fortunately i had bought this in a bigger size so this one fit perfect! Buy bigger sizes!
B003HC92IY|5|My go to socks, they are the best for wearing with shorts or sneakers because they do not show and fit very well.
B00QKHYYBI|5|grand daughter loves it , said it is her favorite
B001E2A2EC|5|This was a perfect gift!
B00A3KJ7HY|5|Great price for this high quality set of colorful socks.<br /><br />Very comfortable and make great hostess gifts and stocking stuffers.
B0002OQGDY|5|The pajamas are an excellent quality of silk although I have to admit I have not washed them yet.  They ironed easily and look great on my husband. I was impressed with the workmanship and detailed sewing. The 2X I ordered was ample considering at 6'3' and 225 pounds they fit. He is not broad in the shoulders so that problem was solved by having the cuffs shortened. My husband is comfortable in them and that is what counts.
B00GSMTUFK|1|I ordered the largest size they have and the reviews made me think it would fit, and it barely came over my breasts. As you can see it was supposed to be tunic length, there is nothing I can do with it and I ORDERED IT FOR AN ALL WHITE AFFAIR & now I will have to go and purchase something else. I guess since it came from China it was made for small frame women but it should have said that. Will never order from them again. Also I placed the order back in May & they told me after about three weeks that somehow it had come back to them but if I liked they would resend it immediately & I told them to please do that and then for this to happen.WOW!
B00VP5CPZ2|4|great shirt but i think im a lot bigger than i expected. if you are 6'1 and 200 pounds go for the XXL
B00FX7HQ84|5|So cute and well made.
B00F1AOQHW|3|Too big for me
B00QYASZKC|5|Went to a bridal shower, lovely compliments.
B00IX111LA|5|I love this suit!!  it fits perfectly - very attractive and well made -
B00J5H95XM|5|Great purchase for my daughter. The colors are beautiful and true to the picture- as well as fits true to size.
B006M5CECY|2|These panties are incredibly comfortable but over time, the labia begin to sneak through the lace causing a bit of chaffing. The panties have no cotton on the crotch. They are more fit for intimate evenings than for everyday wear.
B005HTB5L2|4|These do work well.<br />However they are expensive for what you're getting.
B00HQNIGRI|5|Brought this for my son and he loves its perfect fit!
B00MFT2PI4|5|Really cute
B00E5A2RFC|5|Bought it as a gift - got a larger size because my daughter is a bit busty and it worked out perfectly
B006O19HIA|5|Jeans fit exactly as I wanted them to (I checked the measurement chart to make sure I was ordering the right size). What I like best about these jeans is that they don't stretch out much over time. I wanted a fitted look: fitted they are and fitted they stay! Legs were a little long for me, but I had them hemmed. Great jeans! Would order again!
B001H0RP2I|5|It was what I was hoping to get.
B002SKW5O4|4|I don't purchase these socks for the quality of the fabric b/c if you look closely, you'll notice these are made with acrylic - not the best or softest choice.  However, I like the thin fabric b/c I wear them inside my \\"5-finger\\" (toe) shoes.  (Most socks made specifically for \\"5-finger\\" shoes are 2-3x's this price!  So, the price is good, too.)  These are the right size - not too thick or uncomfortable.  I also like the color choices.  When I'm feeling particularly whimsical, I don a pair of these socks and smile.  I have several pair, now.  While I haven't had them for more than a month or three, I have not had any issues with the socks coming apart.  So far, so good.  I will probably buy a couple more pair - both for the color choices and the inexpensive price.
B00HEUXCT0|1|Its sooo small. I expected to wear it like in the photo. Theres no way. I wish I would have known it was baby gap size.
B00FKNPDUE|5|This company uses Junior sizing so be sure to look at the size chart to ensure your buying the right size. My short came in on time, fit perfect, and the material and color wear wonderful. I will definetly be a repeat customer.
B00CF2FXC6|5|Clothing is perfect, the size and quality. Thanks. I will definitely recommend to friends
B00CI1HXLI|5|Fit perfect and was impressed with the adjustable boning
B00V6PHXIU|5|Cute... Can b worn just as headband for several occasions.
B008Z703GG|5|It's a tshirt. It's firefly. It's awesome. Fits well. Only complaint I have is that it's not a v-neck but that's it. I've washed it once and it hasn't shrank which has happened in the past with other tshirts.
B00L27WFV2|3|The one I ordered just too big. Instead of returning I gave to a friend. Its a nice light material and very cute.
B00KD86M3I|2|This is way too small. sadly because it is cute
B00K1B0D0K|5|Great
B00GLQ7TOM|5|This product is so adorable. I love it! It's definitely kind of strange.<br />Fits well. The fabric is good enough.<br />My only gripe is the shoulders are a little awkward but it's fine regardless.<br />You should definitely buy it!
B00A7777KC|4|High quality tie. Has nice texture and again beautiful in the presence of sunlight. Has a silklike glow even though it's polyester. :) Happy with my purchase.
B003G4RJP6|5|Awesome shirt. Colors a even better in person. Love it!!
B002GU7WYY|4|You can't really see it in the picture, but the neck on this shirt is kind of wide.  It fits well, but is a bit sheer and has a wider neck than other t-shirts.  I love how this shirt looks on, but just wanted to warn you before you buy: make sure to wear a shelf-bra tank top underneath this shirt.  It is just beautiful with a little white tank underneath!
B000QWDQR6|4|Very good overall , but lengthwise it's small
B00EJLL1SG|5|Nice fabric-- lays nicely-- great lil' cardigan.  My 16 year old took it from my 19 year old who snuck it from my closet.
B00JB753H8|4|Yeah gave me the illusion of a smaller waist. At least in my mind!
B00AYKQKT6|5|This turned out to be a beautiful small scarf...I am very pleased especially for the value.  I use these small scarves to accessorize black purses, and this will be perfect for November.  Also, other reviews from Grace Scarves warned that the print is one sided...however, this scarf is printed on both.  Highly recommend.
B00NB3MDDU|4|The hat/scarf was too large for me so I returned it.  I think I would consider my head size average or medium.  The hat/scarf was pretty though.
B00T79NTDK|4|fast shipping & high quality. t-shirt shrank when washed. It has faded a bit now that its been worn a few times. Good novelty item.
B00F8LF9JS|5|These are wonderful, soft, comfy p.j.'s but they are HUGE.  I washed and dryed them and they shrunk a bit.  I bought some elastic and I'm going to turn up the bottoms of the pants and make them into sweat pants.
B00JSJ7JTO|5|Great shirt!
B006VWUT5C|5|I bought this hat in natural color and navy. I get compliments on them a lot. I love that it is crushable and the brim can be molded up or down in any way you want it. I have a small head and the draw string makes it adjustable. I don't really like the rope string as it is thick and when knotted bothers me a little. I plan to replace the rope with a cord of some kind. Overall I am pleased with the hats and I keep one in the car so I will always have it handy in the hot Texas sun.
B00422M6JK|4|I Like Tommy Hilifiger Products That's Why I Bought This One . Its good But Slightly Wider Than Expected. Thx.
B00II816OK|5|i love it!!! cute!!! reasonable price!!!!!! soft!!!! great quality!!!what else do you want!!!<br />if you want to buy good qualtiy bodysuits at such a reasonable price then this is the place to buy!!!<br /><br />love all their clothing lines and hudson baby line is very cute!! both girls and boys can wear these!!!<br /><br />would definately recommend everyone to buy these!1 believe me you will forget carters, gerber and all other costly brands after buying these!!!
B007ZRF24U|3|it is a good quality buy but runs to large!
B00MXL2BAG|3|Very hot, almost like wearing a plastic shirt.
B001KZP20W|5|Like soap on a rope<br />Till i fell down and lost hope<br />N' got poked<br />By a guy named bubba<br />Who thought he was my lova'<br />He looked like dany glover<br />He said, boi, you gonna suffer
B00MAWYNA4|3|I am a HUGE Percy Jackson fan, and I bought this, BUT when it came, the font of the shirt was not like the Camp Half-Blood font pictured on the shirt. It was in a normal, boring font, which greatly disappointed me. I ordered a medium, because I like looser tshirts, but it was like a small. The shirt material was kind of thin and the sleeves were strange looking. As a PJO fangirl, I am very disappointed in this shirt.
B00KFEFHYK|3|Not quite what I thought it was but it's ok..I was searching for more of a rubber waist shaper, something more aggressive. Its nice to wear around the house due to it not being too discreet under clothes
B000NQ0H6S|3|40-34 are to tight<br />42-34 are too long by 4''
B008OQTR24|5|Bought this for the wife. Let's just say it was an amazing night.
B003KWJ67I|5|EXCELENTE
B009POHREE|5|The shirt came in and fit fantastic, it came neat and clean along with another item i bought, Was worth the money! the colors are very bright and vivid
B000QU4TNI|5|I have 3 boys, and I have purchased these school shorts for them, for many years.  They look smart and have certainly stood the test of time, as I pass on the shorts from one boy to the other.<br /><br />Great value, Great style, comfortable.. what more can you ask for?  Perfect
B007BZ5OYY|4|This tee is what I expected for $7.00. Ordered an almost identical tee for Victoria Secret... tee looked the same but paid double the price. Not interested in paying more for a name. This suits me fine.
B00QP8QIU2|5|My husband loves it! This is his 2nd mighty wallet and he used the first one for at least 2 years
B00E3EYJ8I|4|Nice skirt. I liked how it fit me. I can recommend. Nice for cooler summer days or warmer winter days.
B00HIILIO4|5|Soooo comfy. I love this thing.
B00KTZD9S6|1|It arrived 4 days after I was told it was going to arrive. It doesn't look like the picture. The back portion of mine end right below the knee instead at the ankle like the image suggests. It also looks like the hemming on the waist was coming apart. I am usually a size 12 and I found it a bit tight too. I would send it back but it is too much of a hassle.
B004K43MUW|5|I love these! Yes, the leopard print patterns don't always match, but frankly, WHO'S gonna point that out at a cocktail party or club? They look sexy and feel supple thanks to super soft, spandex fabric. CAVEAT-EMPTOR: they're on the small-medium size, so they won't fit chubby hands/forearms. Great value and fast shipping for the price!
B00M8EWZ0E|5|Super cute a little snug. Probably want to buy a half size bigger if can since denim shrinks. I'll probably never put them in the dryer.
B006PTS05C|4|Great hat!!
B00HPZ8B0E|5|This dress is just gorgeous when you put it on, and the silky smooth fabric feels wonderful. would be great for beach, resort, or just at home which is where I wear mine the most
B000QWA2KU|4|I'm a 5 normal and should've probably went for a Med. It works but I feel like if I eat a normal sized meal I'll burst lol
B001JTARBS|5|Purchased these for my husband. Great quality, true fit, durable and warm. He loves them! Should have bought 2 pair.
B007U3GF4A|4|The outfit looks exactly as the pic....the material is stretchy so if ur wondering wht size to order....just order the normal size u would order for any of your clothes.....overall a good outfit.
B0053WVI60|5|I purchased a few of these. They fit as expected. The colors are vibrant and did not fade in the wash. There wasn't any shrinking when washed on warm. I purchase again. again.
B00O7YDZTS|4|Bought this as a gift for my brother's girlfriend and she liked it. Fits as expected and really looks great. Must have for any female star wars fan!
B00GLQG4HK|5|Love it so much and wear it alot. My sister end up take it away from me and i had to order another one.
B006SRTEGA|4|Very nice long underwear.  Have purchased this brand before and my husband says they are warm and comfortable.
B00F9OXNCE|1|Terrible fabric. There is a sheen when you are out in natural light. Appear better for yoga class but the fabric is not appealing and there was an awful smell when the plastic package was open.
B003ICBE7U|4|Bought it for my fiancé for halloween, worked perfect!
B007PESRRW|5|I loved these shirts and so did my 4 year old. I'm just glad I got the size 6 instead of 4 because it would've fit just right with the 4. I got his name on the back of his shirt and the number 4 and it turned out great. I
B0032C2ZQA|4|It's awesome
B00R18TLE0|5|Really nice is warm and cozy. Good material.
B00P20A3IC|4|Definitely comfortable but I guess my cups just aren't full enough except when when I am uncomfortably full of milk.
B00645B36K|1|The description gave 17 X 16 inches but the hankies are barely 15 X 15.  Very disappointing!
B00A7HXGGG|2|Good price but with issues. Fabric got matty and started loosing treads almost immediately. Plus, they're slightly too big. Disappointing product.
B00MNTU416|2|The overall jacket cut is nice, however,  the fit is way too small for plus size and the material is cheaper looking in person. But you cannot complain for the price I guess.
B00PGQ8HB2|5|My son loved this shirt. The quality, price and fit were all superb.
B009UTQUHE|5|Love the shirt. Was alittle tight around the neck at first but is good now. The green is alittle brighter than it appears in the picture but its not bad. Great shirt.
B000GEFHGM|5|Love  this outfit.  Can't wait to see my new granddaughter wearing it\\"\\"\\"
B0084HM00O|5|My favorite !
B007JBK094|5|The five star rating is only because there was only 5 stars . :) My wife loves it and I can not believe how many people stop and admire it while we are at the store or out walking around . The complements come from all ages , which means to me the show crosses all ages . Best of all she loves it. Best gift I ever got her!
B004C8ZCDG|5|Ahora todo luce como un spa!!!<br />Es divina, gruesa, suave, util,fabulosa,,,<br />Muy contentos con esta bata,,,,,<br />Se siente de hotel
B000A2KCEM|4|very good pants
B00EMG3WHQ|5|excellent
B00KZZJ164|4|Nice pair of darker bleu boot cut yoga pants. Yay!
B0077HY69U|2|completely see through... I am sending back....
B00D70ZJHY|5|The guns look awesome but I almost got a detention (do not wear to school)<br />Also they're very light in color but thankfully I'm as white as a ghost
B00A36KBLO|3|The XL size look more like 2X or 3X to me. I really love the print on the shirt and the material is very nice and soft. I bought the shirt at $6.57 and would have gladly bought another one (1 or 2 size smaller) at the same price. I won't pay the current listing price of $37.95 though.
B003EIFNBG|5|Prima quality and good value for money
B00HGRDPJI|5|Really cool, didn't realize the whole shirt was tye dyed.
B0056B0DZU|5|Color and graphics are very rich.  Really fun onesie.  Quality is really good.
B00K9KFZO2|5|I like it
B00CBEAN0K|5|couldn't have been hapier.... will definetly buy in the future
B001GJM89U|5|arrived in great shape alittle too big but with a reducer it was corrected and actually a large would have been too small so the xl with the reducer is what i need  a great looking hat and very good quality i am very satisfied with it  wore it yesterday and a lady i didnt know said cool hat i think so too
B00M9D0EDO|5|I love it so much.
B005H261HW|5|Got this for a friends birthday. He loved it. Fast shipping, awesome quality. Wish it was available in womens sizes!
B0015PKB3U|5|Very good
B00HWOBS3K|3|Too large
B00E0L1XDI|3|It's great colors but fit way to big &#34; medium&#34; and the belt was pretty cheap looking... but for the price it was alright !
B00GU5MH50|4|This coat fits as expected once you adjust for U.S. sizing. I went up to an XXL and I could have maybe gotten by with a Large, but overall I like the extra room. Its warm and feels durable. I live in the Midwest where it gets very cold, and I didn't have any trouble staying warm this past winter, which was one of our worst in many years.
B00JL3QKUQ|4|High quality, order a couple sizes up
B004ZW0GT4|4|love the i play rash guards.  This is the second one I bought because my daughter outgrew the first one we had.
B00EUVTMOK|3|The jacket fits well, the top of the dress is actually quite nice, but the skirt's fabric makes it cling to one's backside in ways that... well, for some of us, may not be flattering. To quote my daughter (age 10) - &#34;That dress makes you look like you have a big butt.&#34; :lol: But the top is really flattering. I'm actually thinking of trying different things re: the bottom (tailoring, specific types of under-slips) to see if I can make this one work, because otherwise, I like it.
B000UMQB1U|5|Fit perfectly.  Love it.  Had to tweak the draping with pins and the belt kept falling down, also pinned.<br /><br />For the quality and price, a nice outfit.
B001O9BEDS|5|perfect for wearing under shirts.  long enough to stay tucked in.  less expensive than the calvin klein tshirts and a very good value.
B00J9UOAA8|2|This baby suit is huge. You'll be lucky if your child can wear it by 1 year old. I was very disappointed that my 6 month, who is big for his age, couldn't fit into it yet. Hopefully next summer when he's 15 months, it will fit him
B00DGM4ER4|5|My daughter loves these Miss Me jeans & I liked the price of them!  No regrets in this purchase at all!
B00H4UB6RA|5|I bought size extra large. I'm 5'3 height and my weight is 165 lbs.It has a vibrant and excellent quality.
B00S2GHCNC|4|Nicely made but the sleeves were too long and a little wide as well.
B00HVRAPV4|5|soft, warm, stylish
B00JJB8LYI|3|I have to get  the shoulders adjusted but otherwise  i am pleased.
B00U8O5YEK|5|I'm 5' 3' & 118 pounds. The small fits perfectly. I'm 53, and love the way this suit flatters my figure. Next summer, I might try the two piece version because the tie across the middle of the back is a bit uncomfortable if you lie on your back for an extended period. Otherwise, this Cocoship is by far the most comfortable of the three suits ( Cocoship, Ralph Lauren, La BlancaI)  I wear.
B00GM3T46A|5|designed well and functional.
B006ZZSRUY|5|Cute
B000UJXG98|1|This shirt was very stiff material and not very flattering. The colors are vibrant but the quality of the material was so cheap that I'm too ashamed to wear it in public and it's not comfortable enough to wear at home. So it's totally useless.
B000PQHTSA|4|Excellent product...my daughter loves it.
B00GVLRQ5E|5|I actually ordered a set of these inadvertently, thought they were regular &#34;waffle&#34; thermals. Even better than expected, they have a nice cozy fleece lining. I ordered up a size, based on other reviews so fit as expected!! Had to go back and order more sets. Have kept me nice and toasty with all this cold weather and snow we've been having in the northeast and worked great on a recent winter hiking trip on the Appalachian Trail!! Highly Recommended.
B00JBYKJRU|3|I usually wear a small, but I ordered a large. With the large, it fits as I wanted it to.
B00GMVMO4G|4|I really like my suit.  The color is so vibrant.  The feel of the material is so good to the touch.  Thank you for this fashion statement, Amazon!
B00E3UZQ7U|3|Tiny bit see through. Must wear light under garments
B00NTZCQY6|2|meh
B008ZZ1OKW|4|It is great and fit him perfect. Next I might buy a different since it is very comfort when wearing it and it is warm.
B001V9LPC6|5|superb material a real tough guy shirt durable likeable easy to wash try to resist keeping it too long in the dryer. if you are a big guy trust me go for the extra large. large seems to fit average guys 185 lbs thereabouts.<br />this shirt is  good for any t-shirt enthusiast as a gift or collectors item.<br />if you like attention buy it. i wore it and became a celebrity so many stares and 'love that shirt'
B007SOUQH8|1|Very small.
B000KEL6D6|5|I expect these will last a lifetime since I only use them a few times a year. They have a super heavy duty nylon shell, not the quickly worn out cotton duck. The only drawback is that they are stiff.<br />I had a Carhart coat made out of the same material that lasted 10 years of daily use every winter, & only needed replacing because the zipper & collar wore out.
B00DXXZTHK|4|The size is perfect of them and I love the detail on the pockets, however they were to short for me in the leg and I'm not overly tall which was a shame. But a beautiful set of jeans all around.
B00K7TTL3Q|4|The product was snug. It didn't have enough give or stretch. I'd like to send it back and try the next size up. What is your return policy?
B007S01V9Y|5|Purchased this for a four year old party instead of hiring an impersonator. The kids went crazy. The adults thought it was the coolest idea! Then used it as a costume for Halloween. This was a great find that had many uses!
B00DYCHEO6|5|Excelente
B00KX89FQE|5|Great product! It meets all my expectations. They do not stain!!!
B00IFQX8FA|5|good fit
B0090472MG|4|Like this product
B0089KFBDY|4|nice
B004P2HBBA|5|i needed a chest belt for my dresses and I needed one excallay so many inches and this belt was exacally  how many inches it says! its perfict!!
B000RU1AJS|1|the American flag bandana is disproportionate and it says \\"made in china\\" right on it.. that's just terrible. I'm actually considering throwing it away
B00OA3GVYM|4|I like the Coats but I will need to return it, Too Large.
B002CWHKA2|4|This little camisole is just like the pic and well made, they just run a little small, otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.
B0058BUDAI|5|The outfit was a good quality, which was my number one concern when I ordered it.  The color was great and the jeans were very cute, but a little long for the little girl who was turning 4.  I bought this for my cousins little girl and she loved it.
B007GBXKZS|5|Like it!
B00VLBR6TU|5|Love it!! Souper cute.. I'm am xs and it fit like the pic... Just wish it was a hair longer. Material is great, not see thru... Solid navy blue with white lace as pictured!
B00EPWSJC0|4|Calvin Klein Boys 8-20 Bommerang Stripe Dresswear Shirt, White, 18  Calvin Klein Boys 8-20 Bommerang Stripe Dresswear Shirt, White, 18  very good
B00D4A1GXS|5|I ordered a medium, which usually fits me, and it is pretty snug when buttoned up but I plan to wear it unbuttoned and the size is perfect for that. For the price, the quality is great and is definitely a good buy.
B003LVYFUG|1|I want black. Basic, dark, black. And so on. The pics are not good enough to tell me what is or is not black - is 'fume' black? Forget it, I'll go buy on sale at Khols where I can at least get an accurate idea of what I'm buying. Arty farty marketing people need to get their heads out of their hind ends and make things better for online sellers - and buyers.<br /><br />And how about a response to all recent quality complaints?
B00E23ZWT0|3|Cheap materials, expected more coming from nautica. Definitely would not buy again, better try another brand for sleepwear though. I
B00I462OHO|4|slightly uni-boob but to be expected with tube bra.  nice lace and smooth under tank tops for summer.  am a huge fan of cosabella intimates
B00BR0FPUM|1|very small.
B00NQYUHMI|4|These fit a little snug, but I absolutely love them for airsoft.<br /><br />The grey camo pattern works well in all seasons, and although they were a little snug on me, they are just perfect.<br /><br />One little pocket button came off, (easily fixable), but apart from that I really have no complaints.<br /><br />Great pair of pants!
B00DEXZ8NE|3|Just ok.  Kind of old lady like and a little itchy
B000VZPT5A|5|This shirt is very stylish and washes well. It was also a great value for the price.
B0062NW4U8|4|If your looking for a lightweight hat to protect your ears and neck from the sun then look no further. Comfortable and cool with a good headband to absorb sweat. Probably wont be efficient for winter but overall its a reliable hat.
B00B4X6MP4|4|great shirt!!
B00DNRTNLE|5|Most supportive nursing bra I have.  I suggest getting fitted before you pick a size.
B00VPAGU0S|4|Its very pretty.
B00II9D7F0|5|I love them so much, I ordered 2 more pair. They are so soft and comfortable I would wear them every day if I could. They're not too heavy to wear under another layer.
B00LTYC9LE|5|Perfect!!! I loved!!!!❤️
B000QWA2OQ|3|It felt nice and snug the first time I wore it. After about the second or third time, I had to go to the smallest adjustment and now it's a little large at the top.
B003V4AKH0|5|Didn't think I'd like it at first because it seemed  little flimsy, but after a couple of weeks, it's doing its job well.  Looks good too.<br /><br />Update: 4-5 months later and it's wearing well.  For the price, this can't be beat.
B0011T88NK|5|that I tough it could be a wonderful gift for a friend of mine. So I ordered also two other hats like this (one with Guns n' Roses logo, one with Aerosmith logo), but I've been not very lucky: they didn't arrived so I had to run and search another gift.<br />I'm sorry, but anyway I'll try again to order them the next year.<br />I hope you could be more lucky than me!!!
B00LWS3T2A|5|This is pretty dress I just love it. A feedback in response of the pretty dress.
B00FUNNKEA|5|Nice product.
B000LKGTF4|5|These jeans fit me very well.  I already had 4 pair in different colors when I ordered these so I knew they would fit.  I like the fact they come in short, average, and tall.  I'm 5'4&#34; and the short are perfect for me.  I love the summer colors they come in.
B000JUESJK|5|My granddaughter loved it. For someone into dance, each quote fit. Plus, it was a good quality t-shirt. I would recommend
B001DEUSDQ|4|Socks can only be &#34;good or bad&#34;. These are &#34;good&#34;. They fit, are the color wanted & future durability seen good too.
B0076QDCD8|5|keeps me super warm no cold at all and very light weight
B000FZVUJK|4|Great fit, very comfortable. Fast shipping!
B00N7T79X2|1|Unfortunately, it is only with a sweater or something on top that I think any women w/ breasts would be able to wear this- not my  intention when I bought them to wear here in the FL heat.  There's no built in bra or lining, meaning 'everything' sort of shows. And for those a bit larger, offers no support.  Without the liner, they are useless to me as I'm too uncomfortable to wear out. And even for just like around the house or w/ pj's, it's just not that comfy. Wouldn't recommend or purchase again.
B000147620|4|If you're looking for a good waist-cincher that will give you that epic big hip, small waist look, this is it!<br />The material its made of are top notch, the price is reasonable. The garters are metal, not cheap plastic.<br />Only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of five, is because the hooks and garters show through when wearing something tight like a pencil dress. This would probably work much better for something like an A-line dress.
B00CWWP3K6|5|bought this for my homepreschool..We have tortoises and the lil ones go for rides on them. I also am a photographer and this just adds to the tortoise fun for our newborns haha since they are too little for rides :)
B00ET1V780|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B00L61PCK0|5|Love, love, love this dress. It fits beautifully and the fabric is a perfect weight. Would recommend going down one size as I am usually a 14.
B001MAAGX8|4|Its a good wallet for the price. Only problem I had with it was the zipper broke on the back pouch, but nothing to big.
B00XWTYZH0|1|Not happy with these pants, there not high waist at All, bought a size 9, I normally wear a 7 or a 4 in misses.<br />These are tight and uncomfortable .
B010R1WCKW|5|I searched for hours at Nordstrom for a professional dress to wear to work-- I'm a physician, so classic conservative with maybe a pinch of flair was my ideal dress type. Once I put this on, I felt amazing and looked great! The built in shape wear really helps. I mean REALLY helps. The lower portion shapewear is a little snug at the bottom so it hugs your thighs just a bit-- not uncomfortable at all, but you won't be able to take very large steps. Not that you would want to anyway while wearing this dress, as that's not too lady like and you CERTAINLY feel like a refined woman strutting down the street. Honestly, I loved it so much that I bought more NYDJ dresses with built in shapewear the next day. VERY pleased.
B00KLDFNCG|5|Good quality, product is not damaged and it got pretty fast.  And yeah Deftones are awesome :D
B007WQY85S|5|It is made with excellent material and is a comfortable design. I have use it in the beach and it still looks like new.
B009RUNKFQ|5|Big fan of The Big Bang Theory and this shirt is super soft and adorable.  It is great for sleeping.  Love it!  If you're a fan of BBT, you'll love it too!
B00KHT7XU4|5|Was very pleased
B00A3N3OM0|5|I got this as a gift for a friend... I will add her thoughts about the item once she gets it!
B009KY1UHY|5|They fit so well and are so comfy to wear! First time I bought from Fruit of the Loom. I am very happy with my purchase and have quickly ordered another two packs!
B00QEUL7ZC|4|Love love this dress!!!  The material is stretchy and extremely comfortable I could had easily had gotten the Large!  But I just had this one altered. Not a fan of the seam placement in the front but its ok. The only disappointment in the dress was how extremely wrinkled it came! I have a professional steamer did that 2 times and ironed it...still wrinkles! Had to take it to a cleaner and have it pressed! I understand that things get wrinkled in shipping etc but these were some serious wrinkles that took a much bigger hotter iron than what I have! Good thing I ordered it early enough before my event!
B00CV321HE|5|My grand daughter loves to dress her American girl doll like her.  This is a great piece for them both.  This was exactly as described.
B00JAM5MZC|3|They worked
B002XZMCQK|3|I got these to wear as long underwear under pants and I wanted the waist to be as low as any pants I had.  The low rise is so low that I feel like I constantly have to hitch it up!  That is a pain, especially when it looks like you are digging into your pants to pull them up!  They are warm though.  You could wear them alone and that would probably be better.
B00E6MRBU0|1|These are definitely not one size fits all. I'm usually a size four in women's clothing and they're small for me. 😞
B007RKXM3S|5|This is like most Volcom shirts, a great fit! It looks really great on my son and is a nice soft material. It is long and skinny which is a must for a great tee shirt on anyone. It has held up well in the wash also.
B00LHTAOWC|5|Nice and warm, great coat my son likes it a lot.
B003DZ0TAK|1|I ordered a Zoo York shirt (from somewhere else) and even though my son wears a med. size shirt, the shirt was snug.  If you are going to order one of these shirts, I would recommend buying a size bigger than you would normally wear unless you like your shirts tight.
B00HQWG73O|5|Bought this dress(2) for my granddaughter to wear for my daughter's wedding ceremony. I love this dress. It fits both my granddaughters perfectly. one granddaughter wears a size 4T, I ordered her a 6/7 and I really like the fit on her. My other granddaughter. she wears a 3T, I ordered a 4/5 same with her, perfect fit and great dress for the price. They have some wiggle room to wear this dress a few more time. Where I'm not sure. lol. I made a  good decision with this dress.
B009FLKLRC|5|Great sweater - a favorite of mine in the purple, but would like it in black as well.  Hope they continue it as it is so soft and comfortable.  Have had compliments.
B00MA5ZP58|5|Super cute! Good quality! Love the price compared to others elsewhere and arrived quickly.
B00ABHGH3Q|5|The trunks fit large, but super adorable!  Love these!
B00NIN1KLO|4|Love how soft it is, hand wash only, fits great on women too.
B0069L9TAG|2|First time I bought something like this, got it to show off to the girlfriend. It fit well, but theres not enough room for my junk, like I said I'm a first time buyer, and maybe thats just how these work, but I was falling out the sides. Also the part that holds the package slides left and right on the string. Would not buy again.
B00GD6HN3M|4|Cute. But don't last long.
B0006Z9RLM|5|I bought these socks as a filler for my order, and they have been a success.  They are extremely comfy and go really well with any outfit.  Looks also like a lasting material.
B004VUBH8E|5|Fit well and delivered as promised.
B00872DFQY|5|Hands down love this vest! I ware it at work as well as out side of work has style both ways, when it's not cold enuff for my jaket this vest really dose the trick, it keeps my core very worm and shipped very fast, would recommend for any one grate for work home or an awsome gift!
B00F8JYDCO|5|good belt
B00QF6BTO4|5|I love the color,,and it is warm.
B00CCFEKB6|4|This item is cute but it is really fitted in the stomach and buttocks area - so I would recommend ordering a size up than you normally would.
B00IAAFOGC|2|I usually don't have any problems fitting in a 2XLs but this one fit me fairly tight and the art work doesn't seem as great in person, and the material they used is really cheap, going to return it soon.
B00A3NBADU|1|Only wore it a few times and it broke. I was pretty disappointed because it was really cute.
B009NQ6V5U|5|GOOD...gift for wifey and she looks hot in it.  :)
B00BMU0SZE|5|I bought these as a gift for my wife. She loves them. The fit and the quality are great.  She wears these more than any of the other workout pants I got for her.
B001CVCPFE|5|It may seem pricey, but unlike most costumes, the fabric is substantial.  It will keep you warm walking around Halloween night in the cold and it is extremely comfortable.  It definitely will make a Cruella costume perfect.
B003ASURJS|3|It feels light, thin. I haven't used it in the cold weather so I cannot comment. I bought it on the recommendations on this site.
B003JH8SSM|4|Bought as a gift, she loved it. Was a little cheap though
B00NVPRUJK|4|Good looking hat, maybe not best quality but good.
B00VP95B72|3|Not quite what I expected. Material is thin.
B00EJ7L9O6|4|I bought these jackets for my godchildren that are twins. They loved the coat but they both complaint is that the pockets are not fleeced to keep their hands warm.
B00I2ZETJI|4|Great top! Thinner than I was expecting, but not sheer. Very soft material. It is slightly more flowy on the bottom than I was expecting - the picture looks like a pretty straight line up and down and it fits me well up top with a flare on the bottom. Completely covers a racerback sports bra! It feels great, looks good, and I'll likely order more in the future.
B00E1BTTVU|1|I do not like this shirt. first it is not the same as the picture they are showing, it is totally different. and the fitting is too big. I looking to return it, but the amazon return center is a dead end the worst
B004E2N15G|5|...for a groomsman who wanted a 28&#34; x 34&#34;.  These were a 30&#34; and fit perfectly.  Dockers now has a permanent Dutch customer!
B00UL8S15M|5|Looks amazing on. I just had a baby and am flabby all over. I wear it most of the day to tighten myself back up and also wear it out. Looks great under clothes. Makes my waist look amazing. I otherwise have no waist without this. Great buy! I purchased three sizes and returned the ones that didnt fit. I went a size smaller because it should fit snug.
B008L0LMOY|3|It is a pretty dress. Very thin, though. Also, please note that it is cut small, so you should consider sizing up.
B0093ANFJ6|5|Yay!  Love these!  I got one each for my daughter and me and we wear them a lot in the summer.  Really cool show and really cool shirt!
B00R4K6J4U|5|very like it
B003EH5OXE|5|I had read the reviews so I knew to order one size up. I normally wear a women's extra small, so I ordered a medium since this is a junior's t-shirt and it fit perfect.
B002DYWGVW|5|The hat is amazing I wear it everywhere love it :) it came within a good amount of days right before I attend my trip to a sunny state
B00NDNHX42|2|I love this design! I wanted this to work so bad. I ordered a large, which says it fits my measurements, but when I tried it on, everything fit but the bra. I have an average sized bust, but this is built for someone with barely anything up top. The cups just sit on top of my chest. It looks super awkward. I'm a size 10, and my chest measurements are 38&#34;. If I had bought a size bigger, it maybe would have fit my bust, but would have been too big everywhere else.
B00JFW3024|5|She loves it!
B00RPVT95Y|4|Great shirt, looks good.  Make sure you reading the sizing as they run very small.  But if you take that notice you should be very happy
B00AL66D9U|4|Great tank top. I'm average sized so I went with the large. Its great for wearing outdoors or for the gym. I've had it for about a year and the words still look great.
B00D43QIN8|5|Excellent arrived on time and is a lovely coat
B006FULX3C|5|The quality is excellent. I have more than 15 Cuban Guayaberas and this is one of my best. The quality materials are very soft, very well finished and good quality. The trade mark Cubavera is always creating superior guayaberas. Do not hesitate to get this trade mark as some others are made in china and the quality is not the best. Good recommendation and product.
B004TERI62|3|I ordered the white bed jacket.  The fabric was nice and since it was a gift, I don't about the fit.  However, the two buttons were horrible.  The color of yellow- green was NOT the appropriate button choice for the garment.  I bought new pearl white buttons to replace them and it looks much better.
B00AAJ67QW|5|Exactly what husband wanted! Good quality shirt! He was really excited to get this shirt. Will definitely be looking to order more items.
B00STVEXU0|5|i love it!!
B00LPV2FWE|5|Wore to class (Italian Language).  Great reaction, all loved it!
B006DWABXA|4|Little disappointed about how it wouldn't let me track the shipping and how the hair was matted at the top but it is a good wig for the price
B000FXW1B8|5|The fit is great...the pattern is awesome and I highly recommend these to anyone looking for nice workout pants!  I wear them everywhere.
B005CSNWCI|4|I'm 5'8&#34; and 123lb, and small fits good for me. The length was perfect but the waist is little bit annoying cause it's somewhat large.
B004356M9Q|5|Great quality my baby
B00D4EIIYO|3|Cute design but the backpack only lasted 3 months. After that, the cords were shredded and the magnet closure had torn off. We replaced it with a little pricier Vera Bradley backpack and are much happier with it.
B001T4XSIW|4|I was looking for a wide belt and this one is the perfect width. The Click-to-Fit system works great. The belt seems well made and looks good. The sizing is very accurate so beware. If you are expecting to squeeze into a lower size, don't try it.
B007PYG9MC|2|I wear a 16.  It may be the slim cut but I usually don't have an issue with slim cut and Levi's sizes either.  Odd.  You may wish to consider before buying.  Nice color though.
B00APNTU5S|5|My baby is a preemie & still fits newborn clothes even though he's 3 months old so these work well for him. They are super cute too.
B00KN6OAHA|1|hardly fits my money. and with cards its very bulky.
B00BPXT6RY|5|Even in a wheelchair I feel like a Man again. A cool man with no sweat.
B003O0N8LG|5|My husband loves these pants!  They are light enough for warm weather, and very comfortable.  In short, perfect!
B00ARDD65Q|5|These outfits are perfect for our new born, the price can't and the fit be beat. great fit and a nice variety
B00GKC9UA8|5|These board shorts are perfect. The fit is great and the material is great. My daughter LOVES them. They match nicely with the Kanu Surf Women's Breeze ii Swim Tee in black.
B00ENLQ53S|1|First of all, this is not what I ordered, I ordered a regular sized hat, not a trucker cap.  Also, it fits fine, but it looks wwaaaaaayyyy to large.  Though it feels fine.  I guess it just looks big.  Also don't forget the fact that I didn't get what I ordered.  Not convenient
B004WPI9R0|2|THe item is ok but my thin 12 year old daughter can hardly fit in it - the sizing is wrong.
B00VGTMNS6|5|These are the cutest backpacks and well made. The colors are bright and the backpack is just the right size for younger children.
B00CQ4CN7Q|5|Good quality at a decent price. Soft on the baby's skin, as they fit well and washed well. Which is a good thing as babies out grow clothing so quickly.!
B003SEYOWU|5|Great shirt.  The color is true to what is advertised.  The fit is perfect for him.  He is tall and finding a good fitting shirt is always not possible.  Will buy from this store again.
B001HMJYQ6|5|My Silverado hat fit perfect, I would recommend this product to everyone who want to purchase a western hat.
B008PFKJJO|5|Very very good
B003EHYL42|5|I would recommend any lyrical dancer to buy this product. I have worn mine for several dance recitals and competitions. Price was very reasonable. Fits wonderfully.
B000A0Y6BY|3|Makes your breasts very pointy! I hate that look.  It does support and is kinda tight in the band.
B00C7JGOJS|5|Very nice.  First time bying the Skinny Jean.  They truely are skinny.
B00KQFSI94|5|Excellent quality.
B00847H4AK|5|Nice socks.  I tossed out my sock drawer and will start over with these.
B00YTXYUUK|5|They fit amazing and look great!
B001LZG0CU|5|washes well but bought size 3t and barely fits my 14month old
B006W1TYE4|3|I can adjust it to make it work, but the bust is a little on the big side. I am a 36 C and bought a Large to ensure it fit my hips.  The fabric is pretty and it is a comfortable fit.  Not too long either and I'm on the short side. Haven't worn it enough to wash it so not sure of durability.  But it shipped quickly.
B00JKMIR86|1|bad
B0064DQ0JW|4|Fit is larger than expected.
B00C7IR9OI|2|I got a men's medium for my 12 year old thinking it would be too big, it was a bit, but when we washed it, it shrank and was too small.
B00GQS2J2M|2|Ok, not made very well
B0008EOBAS|4|Great quality, but if you are actually looking for a comfort/relaxed fit, these may not do the job. There is no elastic in the waistband, it will not stretch.<br /><br />I like these pants, and if you do too but you're specifically looking for something that's going to give a little bit, and let you have some wiggle room, I'd go with the Dickies Khaki men's comfort - relaxed fit, I bought them in the same size and they almost look identical if not for the waist band design.
B00MCZMZAE|5|This is the second pair of Hue curvy fit leggings I have purchased.  They are so comfortable and DO NOT have to be ironed after washing, which is a real plus.  I hope Hue starts making them in many colors.
B00DZL06OG|5|When working in a hot wear house, this shirt keeps me cool and dry. I have several to wear and will continue to order especially at a sale price. Good purchase!
B00817ECB2|3|The large size, which normally fits me like a glove is very over sized in this product.<br />Buy a size smaller than what you would normally wear.
B008R50VZY|5|I like this shirt, it looks good on me and the material has a kiind of pleated texture that gives it a touch of class.<br />I will buy again in different colors.
B00HFP880M|4|I feel the shirt was well worth the money, but was a little large on my grandson.  He is &#34;in between&#34; sizes and I went on upper end.  This is fine.  I got it for school this fall and it will probably be ok .
B00LEZG24S|5|Exactly as it looks and described.
B00V5BTFQ8|4|very comfortable yet fabric and still looks nice because of the design, though fabric isn't of a very high quality, more beach sorong fabric.
B006M44ILK|5|I have a few off-the- shoulder blouses that need a camisole, and this one is perfect!  It fits snugly without binding, and gives good coverage.  Not recommended as outerwear, however.
B005S6BG4K|4|This outfit fit as expected for our son's Baptism and we received many complements.  Yes the outfit is sheer and you many want to put your baby in a onsie depending on the time of the year or the temperature of the church, building, etc.  Even though the outfit fit nicely, like others have stated, the pant legs do have a tendancy to ride up and the cap was too big for our newborn's head.  Also I would not recommend keeping the outfit on all day as it can be combersome to remove to change a diaper!
B0083WASZO|5|Use this bag for biking. Light weight but still sturdy. For the price, with free shipping and being delivered to my door, almost felt like I was getting for free !!
B00GM3HHKK|5|Love it
B0009MZUWC|5|Best socks you can get for the money.
B0058L28Y2|5|Great costume, easy to put on, not complicated, but cute! My 2 yr old grandson wore for Halloween and he loved it
B0002TNE1G|4|honestly i am inlove with this tshirt it fits perfectly and its pretty badass but the front isnt exactly how its shown the color purple in the background on the front isnt even there i dont mind that much i still admire this shirt but a girl needs her purple ya know? love ittt great shirt, and its only 10 bucks . Why the hell not?
B00L4HUKTY|5|At first I wasn't sure if it was going to look good. But when it came in I was very impressed how it turned out. My only complaint is that its only a front print instead of a 2-Sided printing.
B00N616DGA|3|Daughter loved it. But only comes in one size and it fits just right. So it wont fit her for long...
B005DIF5Z4|3|Color looks more feminine in person.
B005JJDMNO|5|The reviews I read of this product all mentioned its running very small.  i wear a size 4-6 and am 5'9&#34;.  i sully order Small sized clothing, but order a Large in this leotard.  While still a little short in length for my height, the leotard fits perfectly in width and am length.
B001ORFNRI|5|Love it ... Thank you for making all these items available
B000CBWE7E|4|This Santa Bag looks just like the picture. Santa and his bag of toys really stand out because they are raised and not made of flannel.  As soon as I looked at it, I smiled and loved it instantly. It's just so cute.  The flannel isn't the thickness of felt but it is durable and made well accept  I think the draw string cord could have been of better quality cording but it still functions like it should.  What surprised me the most was the size.  It is huge.  I bought a medium sized duffle bag to put in the bag and there was plenty of room left over.  I wouldn't mind finding it under our tree with my presents in it.  It's nice because you can use it again, a form of recycling and you save a tree too.  It's all good.
B00N86JD0Q|5|Kinda small but print and quality is good
B001R4C916|5|The socks are great so far. My grandson is fussy about his socks. The size appears to be true. If the child's foot is on the larger end, order a size up for shrinkage.
B008H666XY|5|I got these gloves for my grand daughter and she just loved them.  She looked so adorable on Easter Sunday all dressed up with hat and gloves just like a big girl.  I am so happy that I was able to find them
B00UYICW6S|5|Beautiful! I love this shirt!!
B002YDOFWA|5|This was a gift and the recipient loved it, but it was too small, and there was no larger size available.  We needed a 2X or 3X.
B005QEOSX0|4|perfect! only giving a 4 star because the tin it came with was indented/bent.
B00N4CEGEW|4|great for a 6$ belt only problem i see with it is the Rivet holes on my main holes i use are not ganna last long i given maybe 6 months then those rivet holes will be missing..
B00A91Y6DC|5|This is a beautiful dress♡ I bought this for my 7 year old  for a natural pageant.. and I'm proud to say that my daughter won miss Florida State ultimate supreme in this dress
B00BLF9ETQ|1|We returned both of the ties we bought.  They are zip on ties but the zipper would not go down on either one. They were a bit misshapen as well.  If they had been wearable we might have worked on straightening them.
B00MYAIGDW|4|I have other Foxcroft blouses that are a shaped fit and this one seems to fit a bit smaller.  It is not too small, but I would have preferred it to be slightly larger.  Also, the right sleeve was coming out of the cuff, so I had to fix it.  Since the blouse was not a sale item and was not cheap, I was disappointed in this.
B007SZV752|5|I used it for the first time a few days ago when I went hiking on a trail w/o a lot of shade & I was thankful I had this hat to keep me cool!  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!
B006SRTEZG|5|Fits perfectly and is soft.
B0031U0QBO|5|I bought 2 pairs of these a year ago and I'm still on my first pair and I wear these daily. Super sturdy. Strong clips. Not much else to say really.
B001EJITMC|5|It works in all the basic ways a shirt should, and the printing quality is quite good. This was a present for a friend, and she seems to enjoy it.
B008BHK874|5|Very warm with the quilted lining.  Fits very well and have been told it looks sharp.<br /><br />Great deal on a winter coat.
B002IQ1KI0|3|My son used this for an explorer's costume at school.  Great look but no tie to help stay on as you move.
B00606NEF6|4|Very nice fleece, just cut too small. Looks good with the contrasting piping. Would have liked to have been able to get it a size larger as very sharp.
B0012M26CU|3|These socks are soft, adorable, and they fit my 6-month-old's feet perfectly with room to grow, but they leave her toes covered - and I mean COVERED - in black fuzz every time she wears them. It's really gross. For this price you'd think the quality would be better. I'm very disappointed.
B005N3ASPG|3|This face mask is warm but also tight around the face. Maybe using it will stretch it out? XXX XXX XXX XXXX
B00Q435G8S|5|Looove this dress!!!! Perfect for work and play. Great fit!!!
B00DCBQD28|5|I ordered this shirt for my husband to go with the lounge pants.  I think he's gonna like it alot!
B00HGRI3PE|4|Already did
B00CXO8K94|1|I tried to return this dress. it was going to cost me $22.00!  I did contact the sell. They did respond but not how to return this dress. I  am tall women. This dress runs with a  short torso. The quality and color was not what I expected. It also has a smell to it.
B0097LQQGU|4|A bit too short.
B00ED7Q7SU|4|This is a junior's top, something to keep in mind when buying. I LOVE mine, but it shrunk a bit after my first wash and has been demoted to a PJ top. That being said it is just too cute. Its a great summer top. I liked the colors and fit, so it worked out really well for me.
B00DZX5WMA|4|Bought it as a gift for our niece.  She loved it!!!
B00H9FB120|5|Excellent
B00U7V1OIO|3|don't like the shape
B00EQV0ATU|3|Was expecting a shirt being lose fits more like a 3x.
B00DJPQCB4|4|Beautiful material, soft and light!  I may have bought it a bit large, but easy to move in, so it is good on NYC buses and subways.  Haven't tried it in the very cold weather; using my Ellen Tracy parka for that.
B00DYRINN2|3|VERY small.  Not true to size at all.  Luckily I have a younger boy that they will fit.
B00CMZ63CK|5|Excellent
B00STAHO3E|5|Ready for work in the gorgeous dress
B002I4W2NO|5|This hat was a gift, ordering went perfectly well, shipment and delivery were the same, went great, quality is wonderful, the gift was a huge success when given, nothing more to say, but ... THANK YOU!!!
B00KWF8H30|5|love it!
B00O241FN6|4|Received the hoodie quickly & my 15 year old son is happy with it!
B00N5PDOGO|4|Granddaughter loved jacket and fleece interior as extra.
B00L9WITY2|5|I bought according to the size chart.  They fit just right.
B00KXQ93H2|5|My husband loves them
B00H7UPWT0|2|Very good at first but wearing out prematurely.  Don't ever recall a web belt wearing out.
B00EPQ7HRE|5|Print is fantastic!  I am 150 and 5'7&#34; and the size 10 fits like a glove!  I get lots of compliments on it, super faltering.
B00BWWWBP2|5|I thought when i ordered this item that maybe the embossing would be too thick as many other shirts like this i have ordered were.  The silver part is not raised at all.  Soft and comfortable.  Shirt fits well and looks great for a t-shirt!
B0063R30O2|3|nice pants
B00VFMFARA|3|Wrinkle, not flattering
B002WJHD20|5|My son is a sock freak.  he hates things that bunch up and are uncomfortable at the seams. These breathe, they fit correctly.  just what he wanted.
B008KE49M8|5|Excelente producto
B00J32PG0A|4|I wear an XL or size 14/16 US and this is perfect, I've had it for a week and wear it all the time, I'm already on the second set of hooks so I might have to order a size down soon. The top rolls down a little but I also have a short, chubby torso. The lace on the front makes it hard to wear under clingy clothing but is definitely helping my posture and giving me an hourglass figure so its worth it.
B000WNIZ8O|5|great
B00P9VZGHW|5|They are comfortable
B00UJFYZFW|4|Nice fits good just the print is a little anoying sometimes
B007HOPFO8|5|I had never heard of Antique Rivet before I went online jean shopping for my son. They looked cute enough online so I ordered them along with 2 other brands. Wow, they are nice. They were my son's favorite just because of how stylish they are. Unfortunately, my son needs a size 12 with an adjustable waist line, so we had to return. I have no reservations about trying again in a few years when his waist is larger.
B00NWN1FHE|3|Looks just like the picture,  arrived on time, but fabric is a little cheap and size chart is a little off lol. Still a good buy.
B008D6NXV6|3|The shield is pretty small. About the size of a small dinner plate. My son is happy with the set, especially the axe and sword. He feels like a real viking!
B00WWE9TTU|1|Had a bad smell had to wash twice
B0085BESG8|4|compression is on the decent level, legs definitely get tired lots less, the look is very ok, the sizing: I'm 34 inch waist, 5,9 and 205pounds, square build- and Large fits perfect for me
B00SKA9FIA|5|Arrived as described. The stretch allows for ample room without any roll up or bunching issues. So far handle well during several washes in the washing machine.
B003Y003NW|5|I don't know what it is with legwarmers but these ones are great! I usually wear them kind bunched down below the knee, like 1980s style almost, and they just make me smile. Loved the purchase!
B00F6NQ03M|5|These monarchy Leggings Fit Nice, I Was Surprised They Kept My Legs So Warm, Love The Color Brown.
B00FDUWV1S|3|Bought if for my man, gave it to my 19 yr old son. It was def too small. Order several sizes larger and you should be ok.
B00D9OB4UO|5|I bought this for a baby shower and the mother loved the little darling outfit.  It was a very well made outfit and a bargain for the price I paid.
