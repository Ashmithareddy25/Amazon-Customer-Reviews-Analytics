B00AZ5Y632|5|Love it
B0080RXJN0|5|Haven't put on my vehicle yet but sticker looks adorable, can't wait!
B004ZF39T0|5|Very nice kit and was very easy to install. Lights look great and are exactly as described.
B001DRHNP4|5|Product was as advertised..  Was a genuine WIX filter :-)  Works perfect on 2002 F-250 7.3l  !
B0036271EC|2|seems a little cheap. the red lever snapped off and now I can carefully reset it with some needle nose pliers. I would go for a better one if I didnt it again.
B00MYI0PHO|5|it helps a lot if you have a 6inch lift and need a perfect alignment. Gives you 1inch positive
B00YIX74V8|5|Product as as described. Great shipping, arrived early. Nothing to complain about, I'd buy again without any issue at all.
B00LLU7ALA|4|Super drying cloth, feels funky but really sucks the water from the car. Easy to clean, cannot believe you use it slightly damp, but it works
B002UC18HU|5|Valve arrived as described, fit perfectly and works fine.  Thanks for the great product and service.
B00HR26TOU|2|Easy installation. However, the lights are not that bright and have a blue tint. Overall, misleading product title. Great price. Will need to be replaced for desired product.
B005DUMZX2|5|Perfect fit, fast shipping
B00OZ6U1BI|4|Its a drain plug for my Subaru.  I much more I can state about it other then it fit and there was no leaking oil.  There was no leaking oil on the prior one as well but I like how this felt as I tighter it.
B00DSD6MQC|5|Put it on, it sticks. Looks badass. Had it for months now and has stuck through wind and rain.
B00OC8KORK|5|Nice sparkle
B004AGOXFS|5|Well made. Breathe easy with this filter installed. Buy now
B001KSAB5A|3|the foam piece they attach for proper fit is in the middle of the mirror, so if you need it as the passenger mirror, you have to remove it . which is not easy to do. needs to be placed separately in the package not on the mirror
B0002SA460|4|Pretty tough to get installed and afterwards it appears that it may be the wrong kit... The front tabs that hold into the windshield is about an inch and a half too long on each side so that was odd.. But we made it work. Also, the center strap is more of a &#34;tie it a lot&#34; type strap because the tie down point in the instructions doesn't exist on our 2004 Jeep Wrangler X. Also, something a little better than 1&#34; straps to hold the top down.. We have it almost rip off of the Jeep twice doing 55mph.
B00M468ZSC|3|Came all squashed in a box.  Strap is too short, the bottom has an inch and a half slit in the material from where someone cut it.  On the front is a small hole which I'll stitch up so no one notices.  The zipper pull on one of the side pockets broke in half as I gently attempted to open it for the FIRST TIME!  So that's why it's so cheap!  Smells great, though.
B00V30J86I|3|Prompt delivery. Nice price. Cannot hook the bottom hooks on anything in the car.
B006WAGUKQ|4|Love these things. My only complaint is that they do rust.
B00V3JNG12|5|https://youtu.be/OsMOjO5jJL8
B00EA0ZB7I|5|all ok
B008GVE1G4|5|Nice and bright with 3 different flash pattern. Great price well worth the money.
B010K31VCC|4|very handy
B00VQKCOV6|5|it looks pretty good
B008RVJK46|4|Every thing good and color just what I wanted
B004FFLLL8|5|Just what I wanted! Fast delivery and great quality!
B0002SREP4|5|Easy to use, new hole is stronger than old one and was done in minutes.
B000BWCFT6|2|Too expensive
B004GCHMSG|5|Went quite some time with my side mirror taped up, glad I purchased this. It shipped fast, arrived just as fast, was easy to install and works perfectly.
B002O5P8BA|3|This is a good inverter in that the quality of the output power is good and it delivers the amount of power it claims to.<br /><br />It has some other flaws, however. Whether they will matter to you, I don't know. But here's what I've found:<br /><br />First, the digital display gives a reading of the input voltage, which is fine, and it seems to work well. However, it alternates between displaying voltage, and displaying power. This is a 2.1 digit display (two whole numbers and a 1/10th fraction.) Mine wasn't displaying anything, so I went to the manual, and read that the display is in *kilowatts*! I didn't really believe that, because it's... well, that would be an *incredibly* poor choice of scale for a 600 watt inverter. So I called Xantrex texh support, and sure enough... yep, kilowatts. So, if you're running it full out, that is, 600 watts, you would only see 00.6 as the output power. I consider that nearly useless -- a very poor design choice.<br /><br />Second, the PROwatt 600 is a major source of radio frequency interference. For a &#34;pure sine wave output&#34;, I would expect no interference generated at the output, and as for the input, I'd expect that to have some decent filtering on it. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I'm going to apply some external filtering on both input and output, and if I am successful (interference may be being radiated internally) I'll post what I did to solve the problem.<br /><br />I'm using mine as an AC power source in a 12.6 volt solar system. It does the job.
B000C2CCXO|5|was easy to install!
B005GYI1GA|3|Not high quality - just ok
B004BTJSD6|5|Nice finish, but should include chrome bolts or at least state what would be best. I happen to have a couple in my storage bins that worked great.
B006HZ9ENG|1|Loved the look and fit and performance. But the frames on these broke at the hinge with the tiniest amount of pressure after wearing them maybe five times. The hinge part itself is thin and brittle. For 50 bucks, I expected them to last a little longer and withstand a more reasonable amount of wear in a realistic environment of use. They are quite fragile, be very very careful if you buy these. I am disappointed in this product and after owning four pairs, won't be buying Suncloud anymore.
B00T6JHAK4|3|Good small towel for light duty cleaning.  I'd &#34;guesstimate&#34; the GSM weight around 300, but it is very effective at window cleaning, wheel polishing, etc... and the small size is a nice addition to your microfiber assortment.<br />It should be laundered separately, or with other very dark microfiber towels.  It doesn't bleed too much but can put a dingy tint on lighter towels.<br />It does have a sizeable tag (as pictured) that's sewn into the edge, and it's better to leave it in place.  If you clip any of the edge stitching when trying to remove the tag, the edge will begin to unravel.<br />Overall, I'd give it a 6.  Good towel and a handy size but the oversized tag and so-so edge stitching bring it down a bit.
B001PWFPE8|5|Great add for my 2011 GMC Sierra 2500 HD CC 6.6ft bed tailgate. Install was a breeze according to instructions. Works great and tailgate doesn't slam down any more
B000CMIPYE|5|Gaskets work, great quality
B00064P99W|1|worked for two weeks
B001H1Q0WI|5|Perfect fit for the dashboard storage latch on my 2010 Ford Fusion
B000TYQB14|5|Perfect replacement part
B003ZOLC8M|5|Perfect fit!  Worked great on my 7500 watt onan diesel genset.  Nice to order on Amazon and get it in two days without driving all over town!
B0085XV9JA|4|Not the best. Price right and it's helpful in the car. I wish the thing to hang it with was stronger and more sturdy
B0027AGFGO|5|excellent and priced better than any parts store around
B001JT0L46|2|Fell off my plexiglass boat windshield after 3 days in the backyard under a cover. Glued it back on with marine adhesive. Hope it works.
B00HM9V9TI|1|DO NOT BUY. I had an issue with regards to condensation build-up. This only got worse over time and now the light on the lefthand side stopped working. Item is not eligable for return. I will not be doing further business with iJDMTOY.
B0028PJ10K|5|Exactly what we need..  last so much longer then other brands
B00J4PMLPO|5|This is a very good brake system (much better than the original) for my 2012 Toyota Camry, I am very much please with everything including the delivery. As always Amazon ain't no joke when it comes to offering the best.
B008NO4H0E|2|Shoddy construction, scratched lenses. I bought them for a bit of flare on a costume, but I'd never use them for anything else. The plastic is cheap and the chrome paint chips easily. Pass.
B0068KHMT8|4|Just so you know this is a BIG bag.  Think hockey bag size (maybe a bit smaller) Fits really well in an BMW e93 convertible and you can even lower the top. : )  This bag held enough stuff for a week at the beach for one person including shoes and a backpack.  Seems like decent quality.  I would be reluctant to check it though because of the large amount of white on the bag.
B0001EVXCY|5|Great Buy.
B010SPPV1E|5|Good quality perfect fit
B008HZME22|1|Wad the wrong pads
B00ON8WFBM|1|This isn't at all what I expected. I wanted a decal to stick in the car window or on the bumper, and what I got is a low quality fuzzy-imaged sticker.  I would NEVER knowingly waste $4 on a cheap sticker; lesson learned.
B003SOKEXI|5|works good!
B00144CZRM|3|We followed the instruction when trying to brighten up some boat seats.  It may have helped a little, but did not fully clean if off.  I will try again and if it better, will update the rating.
B005GGLXCM|4|Product works as advertised.  Did not give it five stars because it hasn't been on the car long enough to determine it lasts.
B00CYLWV6E|5|Great product! Stays in place!!!  Easy on/off
B00KL3ALGO|5|Great quality! Easy install and it does the job
B0081SCR1S|5|I have not used a lot of leather conditioners to compare Pecard to but it seems to work very good. I am using it on a leather steering wheel that was getting old and it has improved it a lot.
B002SSMGT0|5|Exactly as advertised and shipped faster than fast!
B002BVXM92|5|It works! It took me two bottles, but it works! My check engine light has been on again/off again for the past year. Two separate mechanics diagnosed the problem being the catalytic converter. The price tag to repair was almost worth more than the car itself. I bought this bottle hoping for the best & followed the directions. My check engine light stayed on. I read some reviews and bought another bottle, but this time I changed things up. I waited until my gas tank was much lower than the 1/4 tank requirement...waited for gas light to turn on. Pored the bottle in, then hopped on I-20. Floored the engine over and over - even manually shifted my gears despite it being auto. The light went off - I then filled the tank with 93 Chevron. That was about 2 weeks ago and it still runs great. Worth the two bottles!!
B000NPXKFE|5|Great just need to use it.
B0058IETNS|4|Use this on my r53 mini and it is great, however I installed with new oem/Sachs clutch with 40k on the setup it is starting to break loose. Probably should've installed stronger act clutch setup
B004K9KETY|5|Probably the best car wash I have used. I used to be a big fan of miguires gold class wash but after trying this I fell in love. It really brings out the shine in my car.
B00Y8902JS|2|These we're great right out of the box - added a great look to the bike...unfortunately it has now been a month and as we return home from sunny Sturgis we notice that they are now green :-( I guess they oxidized or something...hope to get a reply from TCMT but they are now off the bike and sitting in the garage. Bummer...
B00GNHQN78|5|looks great in my black Cadillac
B006X0DC10|5|Great purchase
B002WPXVC0|5|Product is heavy duty and installed without a problem. I used 3/8&#34; x 3&#34; carriage bolts for the install. The backing plates are reasonably thick and make for a very secure tie down. The rings we're very stiff to lift up but I expect they will break in with use.<br />The seller had excellent customer service. One of the tie downs was damaged when I received it and the seller sent out a replacement very quickly.
B00OM7WQQI|5|Awesome quality super fast shipping great price looks great
B00VSI3GU4|3|The headlights and parking lights fit and look perfect, however the four smaller corner pieces are far too off from fitting. They're too long and narrow with the pegs too far apart and do not fit in the appropriate housing of the grill.<br />other than that, great price for the headlights and parking lights. I'd recommend just plasti-dipping the stock corner pieces
B001G7EOFS|5|good.
B0083G3AXC|5|Perfect addition to our chairs, work perfectly.
B006CRT72W|1|Didn't work can't program it
B011YIUL78|5|The Car Sunshades were a perfect fit for my best friends car. She doesn't have tinted windows so it gets really hot in her car. This would be ok if she didn't have a four year old. Kids are much more sensitive to heat. She popped the shades into her window and her car is much cooler now. They attach to the window by a suction cup. They are easy to put up and take down. This is a truly great product. Included with the product, is a sticker. The sticker is the baby from the hangover movies and it says baby on board. It is a cute add on. I received the shades in exchange for my honest review.
B00VAUA4WS|5|I was always a fan of Texans and the shadow lights I love it. I thank amazon for it.
B00JXLH7CG|5|Solved my LED flashing issue!
B001EESTH2|5|GOOD PRODUCT
B0042ZIT7U|2|Haven't actually used it yet but when I unpacked and laid it out to see if it fit the corners where it was folded are very brittle and I'm thinking there are going to be holes there pretty quickly
B004L7J9ZU|5|Awesome shade fits perfectly and makes getting back in the car in the intense Phoenix summer heat much easier. Best windshield shade I've had ! Arrived quickly too.
B00KZD8JV4|5|Very cool and very easy to install!
B00NO79ONU|5|Well made. Gre a t addition to our Vette.
B006K6P68O|5|Perfect fit
B0012ETJ1O|5|They met my expectations, but they were to hot for my light system.
B0089NL770|5|If your Nisan D21 wont start you may need one of these.  Works great!
B00HPTLNJ6|5|Worked as advertised!
B00DEIAUBE|5|E-track wood beam socket is very sturdy. It arrived as promised in a timely manner. Looking forward to using this in my designed cargo trailer work system.
B00C1CSNJ0|5|Fit perfectly, installed with ease.
B00LAD3Q20|4|I have an 07 G35 and it fits great. The paint will come off a little after usage though.
B001LA34KQ|1|I got this decal and immediately put it on my car. It's only been on there about a week and it's starting to peal off. I keep having to smooth it down. This will not last.
B00062YB9S|5|Works well
B00Z7KIZPA|5|The construction of the piece is very good and the straps are secure.  However, the clip that secures the string that goes inside the lid of the console slipped and would not hold tight.  And if I knotted it to make it secure, the lid would not close.  I was able to secure it by tying a knot to the side, outside of the console cover.  Now it is secure.  So far it has been wonderful in allowing me to place items that I was routinely keeping in the passenger seat between the seats, and I can reach them easily. Since my car is small and the seats are close, I am using it as a sling, and have not opened the pocket.  Even so, all my items are secure.
B00RV2VI56|5|Looks great on my wife's white jeep.
B000EDST1U|3|Isn't as thick as I would have liked but for the price it's a good purchase.
B00CHDJB0S|5|Good parts fit my car
B002ZBWKAU|1|Bought in December, but needed to use it for the first time yesterday....it worked for about 5 seconds and then stopped working.<br />Absolutely do not buy this item....it's worthless.
B001DRLPIK|5|This is the air filter I needed at a good price. I'm very impressed with the quality of Mann products. I've purchased Mann filters in the past and will continue to do so. The reasonable price is a great selling point too.
B005WTPC4S|5|Just ordered 2nd set, replacing set purchased Feb. 2014. I would have usually replaced the rainx 3 times by this point. Lasted over 30,000 miles of commuting 176 miles daily. Simply amazing a wiper blade can last through 18 months before starting to streak.
B00E5OUOCQ|3|I could have just read the product wrong, so this definitely could have been my misunderstanding, but I thought it would be bigger. I don't have a big car but this just barely stays up after some maneuvering in the window because it's pretty small. I have to balance it on the window shades so that it won't fall down. Anyway, it does the job and keeps the sun out/car cooler, but the size isn't what I expected.
B00EOK770I|5|As advertised. Perfect replacement
B0091OE6K6|5|These are neat, seatbelts are now more comfortable while keeping me safe.
B00DSGI9JC|5|I love them  - not too big not too small - can remove them if we need the whole bed.
B00D5O6LPQ|5|Prefect
B007CLNIJK|5|You can save a lot of money on this part.  It fits perfectly and it looks to be (at least) of the same quality as the OEM Ford part.
B00AC6XRPM|1|Got what I paid for but garbage bags bungee corded to my dirtracks would have done the same and been easier to strap on firmly...<br />They're a nuisance to strap on and remove and they're too wide and floppy, I'm also doubtful they'd last long if I did use them.<br />Currently looking at hard cases.
B00N3VYMJ8|2|It has a great turning knob grip but it does not stay tight on my MTD Yardmachines riding mower. It progressively gets loose within a couple of minutes. I even used both of the rubber spacers to tighten it down more, but doesn't make a difference.
B000778LCU|5|I've used these before and they beat grease by a long shot!!
B001XW20NY|5|Item 44604 definitely fits the Toyota Venza. I installed this in about 45 minutes with minimal tools. On the V6 Venza with dual exhaust tips, you'll have to slide the two rubber exhaust hangers off the driver's side of the muffler to drop it down a few inches so the bracket will slide through. The instructions say to lower the exhaust, which sounds like a lot of work, but it is only two rubber hangers. The provided bolts screw into existing threaded holes in the frame. The holes are covered by round black stickers that can either be punched through or peeled off. Four of the six bolts were easy to insert with the remaining two requiring a box wrench to get around the exhaust pipes. Once the back of the car is jacked up, you can use a 5-gallon bucket and a few wood blocks to support the center of the assembly while you tighten the bolts. Torque values are supplied in the instructions.<br /><br />The hitch is made in Mexico, not USA. Despite this, the quality is quite good with solid welds and uniform finish. All holes lined up and there is no contact with any exhaust pipes or the bumper cover. A snap-on chrome plastic trim ring and square hitch cover are included. So far, I am very happy with the Reese hitch.
B002P36OD2|2|easy to use. but started peeling off on all sides after less than a month.
B00XVS1GIS|5|It is really bright and stable if you supply a more than 9VDC.<br />I really enjoy it for my wild back yard.
B00QN62V0M|5|Did the job like a champ. Love that it's adjustable and easy to use. Could use some better instructions but with a little patience you can figure it out. Held up in the rain pretty well too. Happy camper
B00B4KTI5I|4|Working well
B008MCDSRA|5|Perfect fit!
B000E322WC|5|Exactly as advertised and installed flawlessly.
B00ROS4GOC|5|Looked Great! We are very happy with the quality.
B002R0QS6G|5|Got the part I expected.  What I didn't expect was a call from the distributor to make sure that I knew I wasn't getting the actual light assembly, just the housing.  Great customer service.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos and easily installed this myself.
B00LMJD19K|1|Not the correct key for a K5
B002JFEETW|4|I LIKE THEM VERY MUCH.
B00KQ7WDZW|5|I had bought one of these for myself at a &#34;tool&#34; store. Absolutely loved it. Very sturdy and love that it folds up when not needed. My dad saw this in my trunk and mentioned he would like one. I went back to the &#34;tool&#34; store and found out they no longer carried it. I searched Amazon for something similar and got lucky when this popped up. So, now dad has his own and doesn't have to worry about groceries or other items rolling around in the back of his van.
B00CHEXFJK|5|Love it so far. But I hope them can be &#34;deeper&#34;. Recommended
B00IT86XUG|5|Awesome! Everything was as expected and fast!
B009B7K43Q|5|We have two of these and they are worth every cent! Very good quality! Buy it!
B0040OM1JA|1|did not fit 05 Avalanche
B012YEX52O|5|Super fast shipping nice I love the produc
B000CITK8S|5|Great charger. I use it for my jet ski battery.
B00192JGDU|5|Bought one of these tables for camping.  Loved it so much I bought 2 more to give as gifts.  Very sturdy table.  Folds/unfolds easily.  The carrying bag keeps it nice!
B00S5ARF0A|1|plastic
B00T36HLYU|5|These were a perfect fit, but directions for the foam inserts were pretty vaige.
B00MJDWJX2|1|3m tape will not hold. Color was suppose to be black it was dark gray
B0067F0V8S|5|Good quality - easy installation - very helpful use of space !
B00Y14ACFO|4|I don't want to be forced to write a review<br /><br />As advertised
B000G76PLA|4|Per description.
B005Z8HAUK|3|Carrying case was damaged
B0028N8DGU|5|Good product at a great price.
B0052XNOIA|2|Fairly disappointed. I bought this wiper less than two months ago and will be replacing it soon. I have it on the rear of my 2007 Honda Odyssey. When I first put it on, the tiny part (about the size of a BB) that holds the wiper on the arm instantly broke. The wiper was still held in place decently well, so I left it alone. A few weeks later, I was in a carwash and the wiper came off because it wasn't secure. I put it back on and it seemed fine, but not I'm afraid to take it back into the car wash. I don't want the wiper arm to bang against my window. Additionally, the rubber is starting to come loose which makes me think it is falling apart soon.
B00E1J4U98|5|They look  nice
B00LO4HQN0|5|Good
B005JCSW7W|3|Doesn't have as much stopping power as the semi- metallic pad
B001GC2LVM|5|Very easy to use for precise leveling. I have used them 6 times so far and they seem very sturdy and well made.  I can be set up and level within minutes of finding a camp site.
B00QUHEUJO|5|Yes they work great, much better than the velcro ones, You know these are not going to pull off...
B0026PI4A0|5|Makes my jeep liberty look much better for pennies
B00T3Q9PSU|5|fast shipping great product
B006GFLI0O|5|Great beanie, I use it for everyday use. The band is nice and elastic, the only thing is if you decide to buy one get two so you can switch each one out as the band tends to wear down with sweat. Also beware when washing, the color does run, I turned my daughter's blanket from pink to purple.
B00OAXVTA8|1|Chinese made junk...
B00757IGYS|5|Replaced my flimsy antenna and haven't lost any sound quality at all.
B005WWMP86|4|This product worked great on my 1953 vintage Fleetwood canned ham trailer, especially on those hard to get to areas.
B00TP25LY4|4|Clear Bra Film is tough and durable, but the product had about a two foot span (out of the eighteen feet), where it is was slit and in that same area the adhesive was missing. Fortunately, I could cut out the bad area and still have enough to finish the job.
B002OMSKI6|3|Seems to function just fine.  A little spendy for what it is.  Wish there were more color choices. But they do make paint.
B000E3XJX8|5|Decent deal, and these are easy to weld. Not sure about MIG welding, but I TIG welded 2 bungs on each of my collectors and didn't have any issues with warping. I highly suggest you get either a plug, or an old sensor to install while welding. This will prevent any chance of a thread getting messed up.
B000KMRT5M|5|Great brake Lubricant. Will not harm rubber parts.
B00NDHVRWW|3|These fixed my CANbus error code on my 02 S80 after I installed ballast style LED headlights. They worked great. I hadn't mounted the orange resistor yet because I was doing a trial run with them. Well... One of the ballasts on the LEDs went bad for some reason. When this happened it must have overloaded the resistor block and it heated up so bad that it melted all sorts of plastic stuff under my hood that the block was near or resting on. BEWARE. UPON INSTALLATION MAKE SURE YOU MOUNT THE RESISTOR TO ANYTHING METAL AND AWAY FROM ANYTHING THAT CAN MELT FOR THIS REASON!! Learn from me. Do it once, do it right. I do not know yet if the resistor is okay yet or not as I will be switching back to HIDs. Will update.
B000EDUUJO|4|Just what I was looking for to hold bags outdoors. It's not very sturdy but does its job. Made of thin plastic.
B001BJLZJ4|4|Works like it should
B00L3MI5MY|5|awesome fit, looks good. great deal.
B002R1OFGU|5|The fit on my 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix is perfect. The install is very easy with only one bolt to remove and reinstall. The quality of the materials seems to be as good as OEM.
B0052C25AY|4|excellent!
B006TMRSWG|1|just what I needed
B000WEPI4M|4|Nice and sturdy. I bought this to hold small 12oz water bottles. The holders are designed for bigger diameter drinks. Small water bottles bounce around and fall over. Needs an insert to prevent this from happening. It would be nice if they were deeper too. I did receive it 2 days earlier than expected.
B003JK3JAQ|5|this is the best product i've ever used to remove odor. i recommend it all the time.
B00RI2J4YQ|5|Very nice product. The bags were easy to install and the pad hits the knee in just the right spot, so makes all day rides that much more satisfying.
B002GYSM58|1|So far I have not been able to get my TPMS to recognize the sensor. I have been in contact with Schrader for help, but so far nothing has worked. Not only am I out the price of the sensor, but also the cost of getting it installed. My system recognizes the original sensors in the four tires on the ground, but will not recognize this one installed in the spare.<br /><br />I will certainly change the rating if it finally works, but so far I get the same message indicating it has not recognized the sensor.
B0049MVBMG|5|Good Hitch
B00466V9AY|3|Battery seemed low and sometimes doesn't work without having to push several times.
B000JL0CV2|5|happy with this item. thanks it match perfect
B00UIOJD7O|5|arrived on time and as pictured
B00BCRMAAS|5|Nice
B0088KMJDA|3|Hat is great but sizing was not clear. It was too big.
B001RBQF4G|5|Net works great!  Good for carrying a spare helmet on the passenger seat. Holds it down without worrying about it falling off!  Great deal for the money!! Can be used for many other things!!
B0119XYCFU|5|Installed these connectors on my 2012 infiniti G37xS coupe and absolutely love the look of the LED taillight rings signaling a turn over the OEM center incandescent bulb. Very simple install. Here's a link to a video after my install:<br />http://youtu.be/KDlUxw_k1M0
B001AIZ5HY|5|I am realy not write a review often. But this stuff is totaly unbefuckinglievable. We will see how long it lasts. Much more better than new headlights. Thanks 3M.
B00AFVCDAY|5|I have used these carbon filter for years. They really help on odors.
B0085I1DL4|4|Great product
B00BEBCL8S|4|works as advertised
B00IY2CZNQ|5|One of the buttons fell off of my original fob, or remote case, and I thought I'd have to buy a whole new complete fob. I saw this case (it's only the case, no electronics) and thought I'd try it first. It arrived quickly, and after opening up my old fob I was quickly and easily able to snap this new case around my original electronics, which meant no reprogramming needed. Not only is this case fun to look at and easier to spot in the bottom of my purse, I also have a stronger remote signal. It's a great product and saved me a ton of money. Very happy.
B000UKG4JG|5|Third set for my arctic cat but seems to last a season or two I'm hard on my 600 cat so I would say change them every couple seasons so you don't have to re nikasil your cylinders
B0023UPORY|5|Good
B0002SR7TC|1|no good waste of money
B004FFHJ14|5|Living in Florida heatshield works well does cut temp in car happy with it
B00NMZ4ODY|5|Fits just fine
B001C9G7MS|3|Good filtre but is made in china
B0017KOPPS|5|Very happy with them. I use these roll bar cup holder on the back cargo of my 2015 Jeep Wrangler unlimited even though their for the 2 door Jeep and still work fine on my Jeep.
B00JG2J6YO|4|It's a antenna!  i just needed the antenna part.  And it brings in the radio stations when needed.  The wire/cable does not fit into the back of my deck so I just used the old one.
B002E59QCM|5|Perfect fit and quick delivery. Very satisfied.  Thank you...
B00559SAIU|5|GREAT ITEM, FIXED MY PROBLEM, THANK YOU.
B009XP18F4|5|Nice fleece lined
B008MISAYA|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B008TDX3GS|1|Brackets are horrible quality, put them in the car and within a week one was missing and the other was hanging on be the inner clip.
B00GG5H0HE|5|I thought it was metal, but that's okay! There are nice!
B006D9WAFU|3|Works, and is a must have IMO. But buy extra bolts to replace the threaded rod. I broke 2 of them doing 8 joints. Also as a side note I managed to make it work to replace the bushings in a few Johnny Joints as well.
B00ONJESV6|4|It works great
B002EBSLA4|5|Top quality filter
B000WO3358|3|The grips are nice for what they cost.  My only point of mention is that the ends are not &#34;removable&#34; for bar ends.  You have to cut the ends off.  Not a big deal, but I was not anticipating the extra work.  Also, my package did not contain any grip ties as listed. But so far, so good.
B001LHVOVK|5|I didnt use the cd but i reset it twice worth the money
B002QFHLX6|5|Great product and great deal!
B00K5TAMI6|2|Still haven't gotten it to work, but don't know if it's the pump or my installation.
B0008G1NNY|4|Great shipping. Unit worked perfectly. Made the wiring job really easy.
B004CHMVM2|5|Luxury, quality, style, craftsmanship = satisfaction
B009Y33Q6E|5|This is a great product.  Bought it for my husband who tends to run much hotter than me and now he won't travel without it.  I use to get frozen in the car with the ac on full blast but with this he stays very cool and I don't have to wear a Parka! Very affordable, easy to use and quite.  Love it!  Highly recommend this item!
B010DP8PIU|5|This device is an emergency must-have. While it is larger and heavier than comparable USB phone chargers, it has the main benefit that it can be used to jump start a car. Fortunately, I haven't had the need to use it (although I did &#34;jump start&#34; my car with a working battery out of curiosity and the battery was able to handle it). I have a small car and according to specs it should be able to jump start most mid-size cars and small SUVs but you may want to get the 600A larger model for larger vehicles. As for the USB charging capability, it will safely and quickly charge 2 devices at the same time, including my old iPad 3 which needs 12W to charge. The product is extremely well conceived, it includes the jumper cables, an AC charger, a cigarette car charger all in a very neat and good looking case which you can keep in your car at all times. If you live in cold weather (where batteries die often), go camping often, or overall commute in suburban areas where you can't always find (or trust) someone else to jump start your car, you should get one of these for peace of mind. I haven't tested other brands, but my previous experience with Anker has been positive and have never had any issues with their quality.<br />For disclosure, I was supplied a sample for test and evaluation, and I promised that my review is fair and honest
B0041Q79QW|5|bought these for my man as winter gloves but he loves them so much he wears them all summer too!
B004GBJAOG|5|A+
B000C5WD2Q|5|Awsome deal .would recommend to others
B005KDO9UY|5|THE BEST HEADLIGHTS IN THE WORLD. THEY ARE VERY BRIGHT AND VERY WHITE.
B006ZAPCZM|5|I've got #617. It's a Harley Davidson CVO Anniversary Edition. That plate gives it that the unique character & attention to detail my baby deserves. Easy to install & got here quickly. Thanks for making it easy. No complaints. FLO
B001DRH7OG|4|Stops good but they do squeak.
B00MOY85F2|5|i love Sasquatch, I place this sticker over last years, the license is different, guaranteed you will not see another. It's cool and it's harmless. Put a NY Yankees sticker on your car in MA and see what happens.  I love this sticker. I enjoy it.
B00IWSJADU|5|I needed a bushing for the rear knuckle on a 2001 Lexus RX300 AWD, apparently Toyota/Lexus do not sell just the rear bushing for the AWD vehicles they only sell the entire new knuckle...  With no OEM part number you can't cross reference a replacement at the dealership or at a parts store...  You can cross reference the 2WD versions though and I believe this part comes up...  On a long shot after visiting every parts store in town and talking to the dealership, I figured I would give this bushing a try since it list compatibility with many similar vehicles...  Glad I did, I'm not going to say it's a perfect OEM fit but it does fit as good as can be expected and works perfectly in the application...  It might very well be OEM compatible for all I know...  Taking some measurements it was pretty dead on to the destroyed bushing I removed, the metal insert was the same 59mm length and sized for a 7/16&#34; or 11mm bolt...  Since I destroyed my original 11mm bolt and it's a hard bolt size to source I replaced it with a grade 8 7/16 bolt the same length, as they are pretty much identical in size...  The only dimension that appeared different was the distance in between the two lips on the bushing, it appeared about 1/8&#34; too short, but once installed the lips flared out that 1/16' on each side making it fit perfect, by design?  Anyway if you need a replacement for a 2001 AWD Lexus RX300 rear knuckle, this will do the job...
B00GJXRCIA|4|My Kia Soul has never felt so rebellious.... even though it looks like a stormtrooper.
B0009IK85U|4|good replacement for wipers, dead mexican bugs dont get removed on these, great for snow blizz!!
B00UVTUFQY|5|I love these.  I have about 4 vintage BMWs in my garage and moving them around and making space is quite easy with this.  I collect 70's 02's which are quite light and I can easily push them around the space.
B000CIT2LS|2|Muffler us great but the tail pipe was not a direct fit like stated. I had to spend money modifying it.
B00BYGMC8W|5|Product was exactly as described. Very good quality, should last a long time.
B00CQ8NF7E|4|Bottle opener adds weight but its a nicely constructed lanyard.
B00MK2P2PY|5|Absolutely love my decal! It's perfect
B00Y1CND0C|5|I bought this for a Birthday present. the person I got it for likes it and put it on her steering wheel.
B00GSAUHB8|4|It's a great product. A little difficult to hold though.
B00891DUSG|1|DOES NOT FIT 2013-2015 DURANGOS. So unfortunate. Style and quality seems great but definitely NOT universal fit, even if trimmed.
B0093A9YXW|4|I live where the sun is extremely oppressive and as anyone with a Prius knows it has a huge dash just waiting to suck up the heat and then release it into your face when you go to drive.  My dash would get hot enough that I am pretty sure it gave me first degree burns on time.  The windshield is also crazy big so the sun shade I had from a previous vehicle did nothing and wouldn't stay in place.  When I remember to use this shade it has made a huge difference in the heat absorbed and then radiated by my huge freaking dashboard.  It does seem slightly less reflective than other shades I have had.  The picture looks really smooth but it's actually kinda' bumpy.  I think this may be to prevent it from focusing the sunlight into intense heat like a magnifying glass and killing passing birds and blinding airplane pilots but it does make it seem like my car could be cooler if it was smoother.  It is also quite a bit more expensive than the sun shades I could get at Wal-Mart, etc, but when you are a hippie with a Prius you just have to deal with its particular design.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend this to other Prius owners.  It fits great although it does curl a little bit on the sides but you can usually smooth that out and the more I use it the more the curling has decreased.
B00HLK77YO|5|Perfect fit
B0009IBJAS|4|This is an upgrade from an earlier Schumacher auto charger that has be reliable for years. The desulphation process is  a must have as it has resurrected batteries that were considered to be D.O.A.
B0012TYXLU|5|A must when you are in the middle of nowhere.
B000VBAC9M|1|The picture indicates this is an over the hump floor liner, when it is indeed two separate floor liners. The product description also fails to mention this! Please change the photo to reflect the correct product! I sent first set back and  am very disappointed.
B003BZD03K|5|Works great, helps relieve the load on the trailer inlet when connecting hose or filter.
B00RH6STNU|5|This is a PERFECT fit!!!  I tried another cap that promised to fit my 2001 BMW Z3 (and was 1/3 the price), but I had to return it.  This cap fit perfectly and the little strap also keeps it from getting lost (and then itself having to be replaced).<br /><br />This is a very high quality cap!
B001UC9RDI|5|Had no problems installing these myself on my Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo 2000. they have been working very good for a couple months now - they still squeal, but that is because of the vehicle - its cursed with brake squealing. All WJ's have this curse. i did notice the rotor warping i was getting stopped as the ceramic doesn't heat up and melt to the rotors like regular pads do - which is why you get rotor warping. little less braking power, but it's not bad at all.<br /><br />I actually did have a huge problem with installation (not because of the pads though) but because the brake calipers require a 7mm hex tool that seems to be the unicorn of all Hex tool sets. i even bought a 3mm-10mm set just for the 7mm and guess what, it came with (2) 6mms and no 7mm.
B00JRE38EA|5|good product and fast delivery
B00C4XFMO0|5|Got the job done. No complaints
B000MNN4WQ|5|Strong straps and great ratchets for medium duty usage
B00M0CQD9S|5|Very well made and simple to install.  I was initially concerned that adding a chrome cover to my tailgate handle would add a bit too much bling however, I am very happy with the end result.  It surprises me that GM doesn't include a tailgate handle with either a chrome or painted and chrome appearance on its higher end trucks.  Thankfully this inexpensive alternative filled the need.
B001TL6O7C|4|These seat covers look  really great in my Jeep Commander.  I like how snug they are.  I have only had them on for 3 days but I like how they feel, too.  I am not sure how rugged they will be.  They don't seem too durable.  They do NOT cover the full middle seat row.  Essentially I have 4 out of 7 seats covered with this purchase.  I thought the price was reasonable & they were not too hard to put on.  I am happy but am waiting to see if they withstand our lifestyle of in & out of the vehicle.
B00REUUC7U|1|I bought this part for my 2002 BMW X5 and the part listed in the picture with the arrows was not sitting in with the assembly and I had to shave it off. Not sure about 2003 and onwards, but this part DOES NOT fit with a 2002 door key assembly. What I did was a work around and not fun.
B000CPJLLM|3|Paint didn't shine like the reviews said it was supposed to. I put 5 layers on and it was a gloss black for like a week then it faded into a matte black. It looks alright and it's easy to use, but this isn't exactly what I wanted it to look like.
B001L9KI56|5|Absolutely  the best thing you can buy for your bike, doesn't hurt the wallet.<br />Very nice on long rides and prevents fatigue from having to grip the throttle.
B00VT2JXP6|5|For the price this a great product. Works as intended. It came with 4 suction cups. The lower 2 didn't stick but holds up to the windshield with the top 2 just fine. Has several different light patterns and the cord is just right, not too long or too short. I would buy another for a second vehicle.
B001PNU0Z6|2|Skimpy design and retractable part doesn't work well.
B002K3UOKG|5|Exact  fit for for my 1996 Powerstroke. Same product as sold by local auto parts stores at half the price.
B00T5G53ZM|5|This has worked as it should on my 1998 Oldsmobile Intrigue.  I also used it on my 1998 Chevy Venture.  Both worked great.  I used torque for a bit, but now I use TouchScan (OBD Diagnostics) which I believe was 5 dollars on the amazon app store.  They really work well together.  It was as easy as plugging this in, turning on my bluetooth on my phone (Galaxy S5)  finding OBDII and syncing with code 12345.  Then opening the app and connecting with the OBDII connection that I had just set up.  If you are considering it, get this one.
B00IKPFRW8|5|I replaced these on my 2007 Suburban once before do to the chrome peeling on the plastic. The first time I bought them from GM for about 90 bucks. A couple of years later the chrome is peeling again. I bought these because they were a third of the price. They fit and look just like the factory models. Six months later I have had no issues with the chrome peeling. Have to wait and see if they hold up in the long run.
B00A1A6PT4|5|Why GM made these plastic is beyond me.  Also on my 98 Intrigue only one of these is needed, the other side was replaced as a solid part of the tensioner pulley assembly.  Why GM routed coolant through that??  No reason whatsoever!  Besides all that nonsense this worked great to replace the broken plastic original.
B005BOQPH2|5|Had to replace the grills on the AC units as the plastic tabs had broken. These fit just like the originals.
B00SISDC5Q|5|Nice light for the money! Only thing that would be nice is if they included longer bolts in the hardware I had to go buy different ones to mount my light
B00AZA34U8|5|Product and delivery were perfect. Easy to install. Works fine.
B001QUD3OI|5|Happy with it.
B008AVCYE6|5|It works as it should some complained about a bouncing needle but I haven't had that issues.  I have installed this on my F150 2011 Ecoboost so it is cool to see it working and when I am in boost.  It works like it should and it appears to be pretty accurate from what other say with mechanical ones.
B000GZAUQ8|5|excellent long lasting plugs
B00TDAM1QY|5|got this for my daughter and she loves it
B00WLUI43M|5|I purchased this kit for a 2016 Kawasaki Teryx4. The bracket bolted right in place and I was able to mount the winch on the bracket before installing the bracket. This made for an easy install. I also used a superwinch  4000lb winch. Great price, great product and great service.
B003NDI1C0|2|This DOES NOT fit the 2011 and newer GT500 without modification!  So now I have a $550 unused paper weight that's been sitting in my garage for the past few years.  edit: I see they've changed the model description. At the time I purchased this unit, it was claimed to fit the 5.4L supercharged engine.
B00OBA5FYQ|5|Nice unit, compact and good deal
B009X1XDZG|5|Factory OEM stuff without driving all over town to find it.  Perfect fit.
B00M9MGH0O|5|I typically wear gloves 100% of the time, but these grips feel great. they gave my bike a slight MX look which I love. Way better than all the gawdy billet sh*t everyone is trying to put on bikes.
B0039LBJGQ|5|As good as always
B00IQVY35S|5|Easy to install and works perfectly.  Can't beat the price.  Looks, feels, works like OEM.  Feels strong and high quality.  Highly recommended.
B00D7646L8|1|Was differnent then its seen in the picture.  No light sensitivity dial and no jumper.
B00144B2LW|5|works well
B00ITETZ8C|5|Very good quality
B00OLPGJZA|4|No surprises. They are footpegs. Nothing new. Forgot to torque the drag posts down enough and they unscrewed and fell off though. Be careful.
B002PL5I9K|1|that is fake or not the right one but it doesn't have any hole nor sticks to hold the pinlock anti-fog.
B004GCPMTC|3|While the mirror basically met the replacement specification, it DID NOT COME WITH SCREWS. The screws from the mirror I was replacing DID NOT FIT the replacement. I went to three places to find screws to match. Including a fastener specialty store, NON ONE CAME UP WITH SCREWS TO FIT THE SCREWHOLES. NOT HAPPY.
B001F0I4QQ|5|I was very happy with this part. Came packaged really well. Had all the wiring neccessary for the motorized movement.
B001C6P0NS|4|OK
B00BITRINY|1|Was expecting inner cover as well. But not included.
B0045WBVUM|5|Picked this up before a 31 State, 2 Province 8000 mile ride.  It was fantastic!  When you blow it up you sit on it and let some air out until it feels right.  Later on you can add or remove air to make it feel like a new seat.  I have Victory Cross Country Tour and the medium cruiser pad fits perfectly.
B004I0H86C|3|It arrived as expected
B00D2TW86K|4|This looks great on the back of my wife's black Jeep but you have to be sure to find the flattest part of your tailgate or trunk so every letter can stick on.This is bigger than it looks & it doesn't bend.
B00TAKM1PS|5|Love It
B00WF9GLK2|5|I was experiencing some sluggish starts as well as sluggish acceleration. After running this through I haven't noticed any of the sluggishness and it has been a month now since I put it through my vehicle. Stuff works great.
B00ONH7IZ6|5|Easy to install in my WR Jeep.  Working good so far!
B00DPAZWKK|5|Better then I thought it would be
B005Y3M880|5|It sounds and Look good on my car. THANKS
B001MXTOKQ|5|Worked great on my rims along with the mother's wheel polish.
B001IG5N2U|4|This is a good product exactly as described.  I am giving it a four because the metal end is not rubberized and doesn't have a rubberized option so you have to be really careful using it on your car.
B00KFS11W8|5|What I was looking for
B00FTAYPTI|5|Worked as expected and easy to install.
B00AXXEL5Y|5|This antenna works perfectly.  The only problem we had was convincing the installers that it did not need a separate slimline kit as was needed on the previous model.  They watched the video Winegard has posted and read the installation information.  So far, so good!
B00K3GBRQ2|5|Very nice product...VERY bright!!
B009DK3SDE|1|Not good at all
B00WAMRQ76|5|perfect
B007ZYH9XA|5|Love this helmet.
B00FMV69XY|5|It's was great  like it a lot
B000CIUTII|5|Perfect fit
B001QYSXAS|1|Doesn't seem to help pick up any local radio stations, if it does the channel fades in and out
B00BP5Q5PS|4|look fine
B0032758CS|4|I have a '99 Beetle and the mats fit perfectly. I would give them five stars; however, the grommet holes are not an exact match. That is to say, the floor mats don't &#34;snap&#34; into place--they are more likely to shift than the original mats. My car has the &#34;oh-so-sensitive&#34; tan interior and the tan mats are slightly darker than the factory original, but they appear to be of better quality than the original mats.
B00CPN0BB8|5|Using it for a arcade control panel!!  Looks great!
B000GELE0U|1|Only holds very thin framed bikes. None of my bikes even fit on it.
B009K67OXQ|4|The first one I bought was bad so I ordered another it works
B005ES2WLI|5|Bought for my 2012 Honda Odyssey EX-L.  Great product, comes in two pieces.  The front part is covers the driver's side and passenger's side along with the space in between them.  The back covers the middle and rear rows.  Easy to clean and maintain.
B00ESCWBX0|3|Not cut very well so you will tear a few trying to remove them. Smaller than what the picture makes you think they are. Took a very long time to arrive.
B000GTUM9O|5|easy to install. looks great
B000MDZLR2|4|Very good product. Fits nicely, easy to put on, and so far standing up to the desert heat. I will update review based on quality over time if there are issues
B00574WIE0|5|Put on canam spyder, look great, thought they might not stay on as they are tape but so far so good.
B00ANBIPXU|4|Just wish I could adjust it so that it looked straight
B00IG4N4MS|4|Any of you guys that have a 6.0 this is part of the bigger plan to make this engine all it can be. F-350 dual wheel 4x4 2005.After redoing the top part of this 6.0. I now get 21 to22 mpg in the city and 28 to30 highway. An this 350 has a lot I its back. Tools, air compressor 100gallon  fuel tank an more.<br />Bill<br />Northern Virginia
B003VLBPJA|5|Nice
B0002STSC6|2|Too hard to see the viewing area to see spark but does work well once the engine is started which seems redundant and unnecessary.
B000SXCLIS|4|Heavy duty, fits my full dress motorcycle well.  Large enough to cover all accessories and windshield.  The only reason I gave in 4 stars instead of five is there is no marking for the front of cover and sometimes it's hard to tell which end is which when I put it on.  Material is heavy duty and gives a nice, watertight seal.
B007NQMFWU|5|Used this on my SR400, fit perfectly and super easy to install.
B00K2G5I40|5|Looks great!  :)
B00BCRMA9Y|5|They look and fit great in my 2007 Chevy Cobalt!  Installation if done properly takes about 30 mins.
B00EF1ES6C|5|Great fit
B000C2WKOU|5|works as it should
B001QV8I6U|1|Not noted that these are size specific, so ordering the wrong size is very easy to do.  I did, and now they are useless to me.
B009DJWNTK|5|Perfect fit and match; easy installation; and the best price I found anywhere!
B004BTB9QA|5|Good part and it fit perfectly.
B000X3ERJE|5|Installed beautifully. Smooth braking so far.  I like that they came with abutment hardware.
B004PC5GKS|2|Installation was alright after buying brackets for it, wiring was straight forward. But when the lens fell off while I was riding I wasn't happy. Then the seller refused to replace because the purchase date was more than 30 days ago. Don't be surprised if it happens to you and don't expect it to last more than 30 days because the distributor doesn't either.
B00LOZM1SY|5|Good
B00O83MWMO|5|Light works great & looks sharp. Easy to install 2 screws and plug in.
B007AL4W4M|5|Worked Easy as Advertised. Plug and Play install!
B0054GO2X6|5|Look great!  Fairly easy install.
B0081F11S6|5|Excellent! exact fit and operates great!  Exact fit right down to every connector, wire securement tab, bolt hole, and fastener..<br />Cant tell it from the original (except that it works lol)<br />awesome! thanks
B00N27ENXI|5|It is a really great item for Maserati owners
B0080MXQFQ|2|Look the part, but not as sturdy. Once installed all good.
B0014479BE|5|This is my second one and the first lasted 20 years. Great Product!!!
B004BTAJ2A|4|Bought it for my Civic, then realized it didn't fit. Didn't know the wheel sizes were different. Threw it on the accord and it fitted nicely.
B000GD5FMY|3|Very good for the price
B00AH8HR6A|1|They were shipped from China and arrived quickly but the SMELL.  You could smell them through the wrapping.  I left them outside to air for over 2 weeks and the smell never went away.  I ended up giving them to goodwill and never using them.  The smell in the car when I took them to Goodwill took days to go away.  The smell is like carosine/tar/rubber. I just cannot explain it but it is really bad.If I could have given zero stars I would have.
B00EP3PV4S|5|Great Deal ! Great price and really nice nerf bars ...easy to install. Shipping was fast and easy to the 808.
B004ZF39T0|5|Easy to install and easy to follow instructions. When I had an issue with one of the ballasts, the seller sent a replacement right away. I love that kind of customer service.
B0000AXTUY|5|Good Deal!
B004C443SA|5|Ordered XXL and they fit great.
B002GZ3L30|4|Great quality, fits 2007 subaru Outback Legacy 2.5i wagon front.<br />Way too hard for me to ever do again.  The coils are too short and the whole thing to tight to easily compress the spring.  A short compressor won't compress them enough and a long compressor won't fit and needs to be hammered off the coils.  I got it done using straps and methods I won't mention here, but suffice to say I was dangerous and I am too stubborn.4 stars not for quality but for my lack of ability
B0023VBJHW|3|Zzzzz
B00OL14WV2|2|As far as the look of it ... It was great it just didn't fit our truck. There was no spot for the seat belt
B000CO86BY|5|Perfect
B00MA33YK8|1|The item fit but its tin and not thick, so it may not last.
B00Y1HU2EM|5|I work at a hardware store and had my boss cut them. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. Within less than 30 seconds I had two new keys that started my engine. I've used both to drive all around town and they work perfectly fine.
B000YCAMZM|5|Perfect fit for the 2006 Town and Country!
B00063Z0TW|3|DOESN'T WORK IN PHOENIX IN THE SUMMER
B001DRLPRG|5|Good filters, used them before. I like them!
B0017OFW6A|5|Perfect!  Just what I was looking for
B001GC2LVM|5|Love it, works great and easy to use.  No more guessing and easy to store.
B00MMLIXPO|5|I was  so excited that it worked first time and every time since. Would defianately refer this company to anyone needing their products.
B00NGONDVK|5|FIT PERFECT AND EASY FIX
B004WO8VLA|5|I Put these Bilsteins on my 2000 S10 ZR2 and they fir perfect and made a huge difference in ride and drive ability. My old Bils were worn out and it was time for a new pair of these. For the price, you simply cannot beat these Bilsteins.<br /><br />These are sold as a single shock so if you're changing two, make sure you order two! Installation took me about ten minutes a side and I had no issues whatsoever. .
B002TMDUCC|5|Way better than the tiny one that was included with the car.<br /><br />With the seats all the way back it fits over the cargo close out panel and is snug against the back seats.<br /><br />It took about a day for it to stop curling at the edges.
B00K9T6Q3C|5|Cool....
B00CMU9GOC|5|It's a must if wanting to upgrade, it's not going to give you much power it's just going to let your engine rev higher.
B0053CS4I0|5|Good Deal!
B004UR30BK|4|Works great. Lighter than some others.  Makes it easy-to-use and in hitch. Only problem is one of the pins holes is hard to line up.
B00GHSD3O4|5|Excellent
B0078U8KPC|5|Looked a lil rough but did the job.  I got this for work as the OEM GM one was not available so we had to search elsewhere.  Found it here and a few clicks we had a happy customer!
B0001WW37U|3|Didn't work well in my car because I hadn't considered that it covered up the flip-open vanity mirrors.  No fault of the product, but I ended up just tucking it down next to my seat.  I am a non-returner unfortunately, so I just deal with it!
B004YJTD8S|1|DON'T BUY and don't believe what they say about retaining the factory ride!!! Every single ride setting is incredibly hard and none of them resemble anything close to the factory ride. It did level out the front end as described but the added stiffness to the ride quality is the WORST!!! I switched back to my OE shocks due to the pounding my truck was taking. I do not recommend wasting your money on these.
B00B4C5JVS|2|I didn't need these for the installation on my dock so I returned them.
B00C6BWYYG|5|A little different from the OEM shocks, but were easy to install and work fine.
B00SGZ1I66|5|Good light for the price. The harness was a breeze to install. Start to finish took less than an hour.
B002R8HMAY|4|High quality oem equivalent components. I respect and trust the gates brand. Comes with service bulletins and the instructions are pretty straight forward. If you are competent, but have never serviced a timing belt, you can do this repair.
B000CMJ2QE|5|Great locks I am impressed with the design and Quality.
B000CF64LC|4|Works as expected.  No installation issues, except who wants to work on a car?  Most likely is the original manufacturer of the factory parts anyway.  Plus they're cheaper on Amazon.
B007EWVYOS|3|Great product but the packaging needs to be looked at. The cap-brush is bent during packaging. I returned the first one thinking it was defective. The next one came the same exact any. Oh well still awesome for power windows!
B007SCNSKW|5|Love it!! Cheeee Pono!!
B00OPD6SQS|5|Love this stick thus is actually my seconds one I got into a car accident and of course couldn't take the other with me lol
B00CJLF3UA|5|Fitsy 99 vw beetle 2.0
B00M78820I|5|Wanted to let you know that the sun shade works fine. It gets very hot in Dallas, sometime it goes up to 109. I used the shade and noticed that the car was considerably cooler than when there was no shade applied. Taco method of folding the shade also works fine. All in all, satisfied with the purchase.
B00Y2109M2|4|you get what you pay for. they are nice, and i like them
B004OH8X18|5|The product arrived on time. Very satisfied with the order and product.
B008H50VXG|5|They were a perfect fit and had a great grip
B002H9ERBU|5|Replaced worn out OEM sway bar link. Built better than Acura's. Can't go wrong with MOOG
B008E001IO|5|Great product
B00LZO1X38|5|It works perfectly in the American version of the 2013 base vw golf
B00PT5OA2U|5|How big is the sticker?
B00MTHPAN4|1|No batteries, no instructions. I know it sounds like these are simple, but I had to research to find out that they should have come with batteries. Very cheaply made and no contact information sent with mine. I would NOT buy again.
B00008RW9U|5|Love this.  Came fast.
B00GPJRDEQ|5|Good fit and good quality shirt. Seems to run small.
B00OMZLP30|5|I am wiring an auxiliary lighting system into my house, to be powered by 12-volts DC. I needed a good quality, low cost wire for this low tension application. This wire is working perfectly for my needs.
B0024X2SC4|5|PERFECT
B00OABWI14|4|Stitching looks a little cheap up close nd there not the most comfortable but they look cool. Nd that's the only reason I wanted them.
B00N48LYIM|3|had to modify for my application.
B000C55VUM|5|It's not painted it WILL rust! Lol. Great part.
B000Z0HVHA|5|quality product
B0002SR2RY|5|Works just fine, to remove engine oil pressure switch.
B009VYWIMO|1|We purchased this camera and had it installed in our suv.The vehicle sits in the garage most of the time so not a lot of moisture. The camera worked good for about a week and then no picture. This is probably one of the worst products I have ever purchased. I would not rocommend this product at all ,
B001PNAR8Q|5|Good product
B004O844EM|5|this with the rack made a nice addition to my 4runner/ without the extension the standard rack is too small for my needs and for appearance on the truck
B000VTTDYY|5|worked perfect and mounted just like the original.
B00YBGA78E|5|Perfect. Exactly what I wanted and works very well.
B00KTHSYXO|5|Works great
B003VGOBGY|5|Quick shipping, item was exactly as advertised.
B007A8OFHO|5|Purchased this chain for a Suzuki Z-400 quad I was borrowing. My original intent was to buy a lesser grade chain and install on this quad before returning . After some thought out consideration I decided I would go ahead and purchase my buddy the better chain. Glad I did because not a week later he offered to sell me the atv at a discount  and now I do not have to worry about constant maintenance on a lesser grade chain.<br /><br />Chain arrived in perfect condition sealed in a pack with lube still tacky and not dried up like I have purchased from local shops in the past.<br />This is a durable chain at solid price and I am glad I chose this route.
B003UM7B98|5|I've done a couple of oil changes with this as well as a brake change, had it for several months now, working great so far.  Only complaint is that it came without nut that goes on the screw connecting the handle bar to the base.
B00LG39X6W|5|LOVED IT! I got bonus stickers too! These guys ROCK!!!! THANK YOU for sending them SO fast!
B00020BM1Y|4|Cool timing light, still going strong no problems.
B001449ZBQ|5|Very happy, perfect part like decribed and very fast shipping
B0087NAWYQ|5|Works great😎
B00MBBH3RO|5|Perfect works well, and easy to set up.
B00EE1JMAK|5|Great
B00ZDHCDJQ|1|wasn't able to program
B007XYDXZ0|5|Perfect fit
B00A6VS7TO|1|Didn't worked
B005R27ZK4|5|Great quality! I put them in my 1996 geo tracker and they fit well.
B004IYSY5C|5|FIxed the AC problem for good.  Attempt to change this yourself unless you are a contortionist.  LOL
B000C9IZXI|5|Perfect on my 01 Civic, buy a set of brake pliers! I lost mine and had to improvise.
B00P68DQRU|5|Love it!
B00KN0UOEE|5|Seems to work great so far.
B000C2AMZ4|5|Stopped my leak and now have 10 K since repair!
B001BBV704|3|When I received it the exhaust tip was bent. Buddy Club stated it should just bolt on and it did not. I had to modify a few things and weld the catalytic converter to it. Sounds great but the suppressor is ugly and pointless unless you live in CA where they have strict emission laws.
B0014FGVVW|5|Super solution to plug cross threading.  This thing really works!  Don't try to force your plug in when you realize it isn't going in correctly, back it out and get this thing to clean the threads.  Good item to have on hand, for sure.
B001Q4SM1S|5|Works just fine!
B00D3298A0|1|This set of floor mats smells badly.  I putted it outdoor for days and the horrible rubble smell still exist.  I also noticed that this rubber mats release some ugly dark brown liquid under heat in the summer.  I try to return it to the seller and got rejected.
B00C8HY1JY|4|They have worked real good , the best price n service on amazon
B00NGY6H68|5|What a pain to have to replace while doing spark plugs but better to do it all at once than HAVE to do the same job over.
B006JRJF72|5|Excellent faucet for my pop up trailer.  Went in easy and no leaks.
B001FLSMI0|4|Great rotors for the price, good fit, quiet
B000GZCNAY|5|Just what i needed. Works perfect.
B009YY00JY|5|Recipient loved the gift. Cute and thoughtful way to show someone you care.
B0009V1WS4|5|just what I needed
B0006IX850|5|Great product and works very well.
B00UJ5YNYU|4|Lights are amazing. The body is aluminum and have some weight to them, wiring is proper gauge, and rubber sleeve add a nice finished look.Only item for concern is that you can over tighten the screw and strip the housing threads.<br /><br />Other than that very good value.
B008S9CJZO|5|Looks great. Works as it should.
B004ZM3VQO|2|I do not believe that these are genuine OEM products. They are a copy, a good copy, but a copy nevertheless.  The price is attractive.
B006X152SU|1|Ugly.  The leather looks like the fake Gucci bags sold on the Czech border.  The material straps look ridiculous on a leather bag.  For the price, I'm not returning it... I will give it away to that idiot relative that we all have and dislike for their birthday.
B001MU28R0|5|Perfect fit for 05 Hemi QC 4x4. make sure to replace at every 30K miles. Set aside a good 2-3 hours as you are replacing 16 plugs on your Hemi Ram!  Immediate notice of more power and 1.5 mpg better --- so again replace at recommended intervals! I went 35K because I was busy. However I will make sure I go at 30K as the MPG gained far outweighs the cost of 16 plugs.
B000UOBIZC|4|Caps work great gives a nice flat surface on top of levelers
B003V5RL8A|4|Good product for the money. wish it fit a little better.
B00C5HCK8Q|4|Like the previous reviewer, my spare tire was also almost 2 years old when I received it.  It was not dried out, cracked or dirty, and appeared to have been properly stored in a clean dry warehouse.  It was unused, and the little &#34;nubbies&#34; on the tread showed no wear.  It is the exact same brand/model tire and the exact same chrome wheel as came with my Kar Kaddy SS.  It looks like it will give good service - hope I never need it!
B00DORCF1I|4|good value...
B003ZWJC18|3|These fit on the vehicle but they are a little bit loose.  Not the kind of fit I expect for an OEM part
B00XPTJKWW|3|Brackets and Cable were slightly too large but useable.
B0031XQRNW|5|Delivered in a timely manner.  Great price.
B007G7PWSA|5|Thank god dealership wanted to charge 80 for the same oil
B00GUF74HQ|4|fit great. needed help installing.
B00F17Q8BM|5|Worked  great
B00FAIBMOA|5|Great product.  Received undamaged and very timely.
B00SRFPG9K|5|Perfect fit..looks great!!!
B005FKWZXK|5|Looks great stops on a dime very quite great deal and was here on time
B000FQ071Q|4|great product. fit without any mods. be careful when ordering, stated free shipping but was charged freight on each spring order!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00HX8ZNN6|1|Only had them a month and already having to replace
B00GRHRTEU|4|These work nicely. Yes, the mirrors &#34;whistle&#34; above 30 mph, but you're in a Jeep with the doors and top off! They do shake at highway speeds and there is no choice for right or left, so the mirror used on the right will not offer a wide field of view as you get with your OEM mirrors.  This is easily solved with the addition of blind spot mirrors that stick on. Additionally, I'd read in a review where someone had to gently squeeze the bracket to hold the mount tighter.  This was also the case with me.  Not a real issue, but something to add.  Also, two of the screws supplied did not fit the thread pattern for my TJ, but I was able to use the screws that were removed, so again, no real issue but I did want to add that to the review. I really like the throwback look these mirrors gave my Jeep.  I decided to take the OEM mirrors off my doors and use these exclusively. They work well; however, you must be careful when opening the door as it will hit the mirror and move it.  All in all, they do their job and look great, but you do have to work with it a little during the install.  At the end of the day, you're still in a Jeep, and I really don't see too many people upset whilst riding with the top and doors off!!
B00KWDMHJM|3|Lexus name carries a price.
B005BNP7YU|4|the only issue I had was the length of the chord other than that everything was perfect. that's the only thing keeping it from a five star rating
B00R980FE2|4|Good replacement for original.
B000ST5AY4|5|good .
B00J8RJRIW|5|Bought this for my Husband to go with his 50th anniversary Mustang. He loves it!!
B000GTZE5G|5|Fits nice. low profile.
B003VCELCW|5|Fit on my 2009 Subaru forester. Job done, works as expected.
B00496X5DK|5|Good
B00GNU38L4|5|Excelent !!!!
B004BTJE2G|5|I really liked the way it was packaged - with all the o-rings and the corresponding TBI gaskets were included!
B00LO0M918|5|Every lamp worked. Like another poster said, these are polarity sensitive. If it doesn't work take it out and rotate the lamp 180°. My suggestion. Remove the old lamps first then turn on the fixture. While inserting the lamp if it does not illuminate then rotate! I've included screenshots from an app I DL'd. True the app may not be accurate but it does add a comparison factor. The readings indicate that the LED lamps are not as bright but visually speaking they are brighter IMHO.
B00KJGCEXG|5|I had to take the key to the dealership to get it made but it worked and that's al that mattered.
B00Q5TPGA4|5|Exactly what I wanted
B001MYWBF0|5|Easy to use, quick to charge batteries, easy to transport.
B002HR6HH4|5|ole lady loved it
B00GAVZ3U0|5|It's Slayer. of course it's 5 stars.
B004XMBXRU|4|It did not align exactly but it may have been my own fault when installing it. But it was the correct part.
B00IMPEWHM|5|PRODUCT WAS AS EXPECTED
B00FX961T2|5|Arrived on time, damage free, and works well!
B00065ZIJ2|5|Never owned the &#34;original&#34; but this one works great!  Solid and secure.  Hope it deters the thief to move on to the next auto.
B007QV11FE|1|With no coupler to fit the nipple it has, it's useless. I sent it back for a refund. FYI: It requires a Tru-Flow 1/8&#34; coupler, and there are none to be found this side of China. No one answers when you call their tech support number. Left a message and they finally called back... three days later after I had returned it!
B007P9YX0M|5|Great gear. Fits well. Packs well. And keeps boots dry.
B000C7VZUA|5|Worked great . The Jeep was over heating badly with the old radiator and now its cool as a cucumber. Install went really smooth too. Having a mix of metric and standard nuts and bolts was confusing.
B00DSD5FHY|5|Brings me back to my younger days!!!
B000EQRR9M|4|Brakes working nicely, thank you.
B009PCVAHG|5|Awesome deal!! Super fast and the sticker looks Great! Thank you so much
B00MAURR40|5|My son loves these
B00WG5KE6M|5|quality construction, extremely bright
B0089LSMSE|5|As advertised! Will definitely buy again in the future.<br /><br />Great Product!
B000B8JUNY|5|Made my check engine light turn off and stay off.
B00GRDPMG6|5|A
B0087NB6D2|2|Wire too short.  The Aux head is too large and does not fit into nolan socket
B00KQWGNJY|5|i haven't installed any of my suspension parts yet. I am acquiring  all of my pieces slowly but surely. I still have a few more purchases to complete my parts list before I can begin to install them myself. when finished, I will rate and review these products. I am very much looking forward to rebuilding the entire front end on my 1981 el camino. i'm sure every component has never been replaced due to the sloppy handling, but by building with high performance items I am sure that my car will handle like a pro touring package. I love the fantastic prices that amazon has to offer and looking forward to many more purchases from them. john barre
B00G97N2YO|5|I've tried several different types, and this is much better than the others:  It's thicker, and goes on easier than the thin types.  Look for the 12-year rating.  It makes a difference in application and durability, yet doesn't cost more money!
B000C3YTM0|5|fit well!
B0012TRBT6|5|Fits a bit snug in the VT750 but priced just right.
B00B2FWHHQ|5|Fits great, feels great, looks great!
B009LNGQPK|5|Great
B004OHEWZE|5|Excellent
B00PV5DQV4|5|fast shipping heavy duty
B00ZRZGXN6|5|Awesome cover and very good quality!  It's not cheap-looking and I get complimented when people ride with me.
B0040DX7EO|1|Disappointed in this product ,got a car wash and the mirror is full of spots that won't come off
B0084UK2II|5|Everything was accurately depicted and shipping was earlier than expected!
B000GTTAZG|3|Not bad to add some bling to your engine
B00AMMCE3C|5|ok
B00RJ3PNC6|3|I found another brand that works much better, did not see any difference in the air quality with this unit.
B00B0Z8N30|4|After receiving a defective one originally, the replacement was flawless. I got the one with the turn signal indicators, a feature that many don't offer.<br /><br />Only complaint is the gps sometimes take a minute to find the satellites.
B007FDO4K2|5|Loved it. Came on time.
B004Y9ZQSE|3|Good and sturdy, However, pretty difficult to raise bike on stand by yourself. I needed another person to stabilize bike while I lifted.
B00WFHZ6QE|1|It won't work on my Toyota Prerunner.  Wrong chip
B005IYBS1I|4|Good quality and priced well when I bought.
B000BUOSGG|5|This is built very good and is just too perfect for Our RV..It is too cool.
B001JT58OY|5|ok
B002OUMVWY|4|works great
B000CIAVC2|5|Perfect fit, and best price I found.  This is a LuK Repset, properly marked, boxed and sealed.<br />**MAJOR NOTE** - the release bearing thrust face is LOOSE BY DESIGN, it 'wobbles', which is disconcerting, but correct.  The wobble allows for minor misalignment between bearing and clutch fingers.  Search for 'LuK &#34;Product information - Release Bearing 500 0035 10&#34;' or see Luk tech bulletin here: http://www.skruvat.se/digitalgoods/LUK500%200035%2010_1.pdf<br />Also, the alignment tool WAS included in the kit I received, sealed in plastic bag with the warranty card and the pilot bearing.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|fits in my giant truck windows just fine. blocks light well for being so light weight. folds up easy and fits out of the way.
B00QMWQK2M|5|Sturdy, easy to put in place and will catch sandy and dirt nicely. Overall, I highly recommend this product to only looking for some affordable, quality floor mats.
B00TPV6EUK|4|We have been using this soft front windshield on a Polaris for over a month, at it is working great.  The plastic window is very clear (other than the occasional glad you might expect from a soft windshield) and it is durable.  It has withstood the impact of tree branches very well.  Helps that it is easy to install and easy to remove.  Very good solution as a replacement windshield.
B001KQD7YE|5|works great
B005XSNAWO|3|Nice looking grips, but in the heat the rubber gets sticky.
B00FTAZ51K|5|These lifts replaced the ones that went out on our 2005 Yukon XL.  I got tired of holding up the glass or for it to stay up only to fall and hit me in the head a few times.  The lifts were easy to replace and only took about 10 minutes.  As one commenter stated though, these are some really mean lifts.  You kind of have to push the glass down to shut it, but it's not too bad.
B00B3HXYH0|5|I used this on a Harley that included split gas tanks, and two full fenders. It was plenty of product to complete the job, I did use all the primer since I did high build and a sealer. The instructions available on HOK are very helpful and the paint came out very well for my first attempt. HOK has a new happy customer.
B000JZI1U2|5|Fits mine 1999 XJ with inline 6 with no problems.
B006WOHML8|5|It looks absolutely amazing on my BMW and the plate its self is heavy and well made. Will definitely buy from here again.
B00YE5Q0Q0|4|I have not actually used it to start a vehicle but am very confident in my thinking that I will  not have a problem. Looks like a quality product.
B005CLMR44|5|Excellent
B004A32ODE|5|worked perfectly..  Thank you.
B0013FU1WS|5|Fixed the old leaking one fine.
B00ND9Q18K|5|great product for Mazda CX-5 Grand Touring, but doesn't look  anything like the photo. CX-5 model has two plastic hooks that connect to small bars on the rear window. so when you open the trunk door, the cover lifts out of the way. Took 30 seconds to &#34;install&#34;. does exactly what I wanted it for.
B00JGP8I1S|1|I just today tried to install this on my visor, and the visor clip immediately broke  Pretty disappointing.  I got zero use out of it.
B00AQZBVHK|5|Ordered them and they were here in two days, quick shipping and OEM parts at a fair price, What more do you want?
B00VWK73QQ|5|Perfect for anyplace you want peace and quiet!<br />Stick them everywhere around the property!<br />Aim them at noisy neibors...or toward passengers on the back of helmet.
B00HVHSTU8|5|Like this item to keep key fobs from breaking.
B00KU93U58|5|Good quality and  bright
B00MRI9M70|5|Just in time for the 1st day of 1st grade...My son is so happy and so excited.  This is a great backpack.  Love the angry birds on the zipper, the pockets inside and the padding on the straps!<br /><br />I bought this for my son.
B00755OR8Y|5|Was hoping the white area around the frog was translucent because it went on my car, but it's white. Still love it
B006X8BATI|5|Really nice fit for my 2013. Went out and bought my own stainless steel hardware just to avoid any problems down the road that may arise due to rain, snow, salt, etc. Mounting it was fairly easy.
B004RC8TU0|1|Decal is too big so I won't put it on my car because you could be 50 feet behind  and read it...
B00T9GNAYE|5|These lights are brighter than i expected - in a good way!. I tested them out at night and i plan to mount them on my brush guard. With both lights on they provide just as much light as my headlights - very surprised. The casing seems very sturdy and doesn't seem like it will break easily. These seem very similar to the Rigid spot lights which i would expect since they are priced similarly.<br /><br />The only downside i feel is that for this price they should come with a wire harness and a button to turn them on - as similarly priced lights do. This would then have everything needed to get them installed and working. Or have them come with a connector on the end so you can plug into a common wire harness. My truck was already wired from the previous owner so i just need to figure out that harness and i should be ok.<br /><br />While i haven't been able to compare these to other lights yet - i will be keeping these and i think i will be very happy with them. Overall a good purchase!
B005I68Q5C|2|Once you get the shade in place, it works fine. But I'm disappointed with the design of having to roll it up after every use. I used to have one that folded, and that's a better, more practical way of taking it in and out of the window and storing it until next time. Plus, they have a Velcro strap that restricts that you can only roll it up one way. And it's short, so you have to roll it tight. Not well thought out. I'm going to get a folding one.
B00C44NE2Q|3|Does the job but very flimsily constructed.  I don't see this lasting long. Had to find my own u-bolts to make it fit my Thule.  I will never put this rack on the outside by itself. I will sandwich between better racks.
B000EAIERW|5|Great product that met all of my expectations.  Easy installation and looks great on my Wrangler.
B000IG3JJA|1|Honestly I wouldn't give these seat covers even 1 star they are just horrible
B00589S032|5|It's good i like it 👍
B00L4HQRRS|5|Bought this for my 2003 525i already looks like and upgrade I love it! Will post pic as soon as it's painted
B000CD57JE|4|Good
B004A69E7A|1|A year later the sway bar flange snapped off.  Junk.  Steer clear.     Works as expected.  No installation issues, except who wants to work on a car?  Most likely is the original manufacturer of the factory parts anyway.  Plus they're cheaper on Amazon.
B00K1C1WC2|4|not sure
B00GURPYP8|5|fast shipping part was easy to get in works good
B004TP2CM6|5|whee, fresh air when we ride
B00F9K3JKO|1|&#34;High quality vinyl&#34; &#34;durable&#34; and the very patriotic nod to &#34;AMERICAN WORKERS&#34; are all well and good but I received a printed sticker not anything close to vinyl like I expected. It was cheap so you live and you learn. Please update the description so people get an accurate expectation.
B005N53AM2|5|I can actually Touch my steering wheel now in this very hot weather without burning my hands off!
B001Q8IM6O|5|great
B00BZP3PQA|5|Very cute, exactly what it shows on the picture.
B000C453D8|5|great
B008PJDOSS|5|The air my 2012 Focus was musty until I installed one of these.
B0002Q7C3A|5|My brake and turn lights are on separate circuits. This device helped me hook up my adapter. No I use it to make sure everything is working okay.
B001JT342M|2|cheap and cheaply made,should have returned it
B00317FZM2|2|These lights leak water
B002ITR66W|2|Again, Kuryakyn is slipping on post correct picture with correct part.  Picture is of a &#34;Perch Mount&#34; and after further research on their site, the part number is for a 1 inch handle bar mount.  Still trying to get the perch mount as their isn't any room on the new Limited's handle bars.
B00AXMAN9I|5|We have a 1996 F-250 long bed and this fits absolutely perfect in our truck bed tent. Very easy to manage,
B003S6F210|5|Loved the motors, very powerful and run very smoothly. It was easy to install and they even come with the plastic clips to attach to the door frame. I will try to update after a few months use.
B00OYEBPD4|5|This was very easy to install, fit perfect, gret dealing with them, prompt delivery and bang on specs! Thanks!
B000TK8NN2|4|not really needed
B003BSB7PU|5|Arrived quickly and exactly as expected.
B0009JKI86|5|Great product and will purchase again.
B00OL4NCB0|5|came in the mail 2 days earlier than the estimated delivery time. Fits great and looks great
B001P1036O|5|Arrived early.  Exactly as described....  Looks good in the truck....  Would order from again
B004GCKPHG|5|perfect fit and great prices and fast delivery
B00CASDZKC|5|Work great and simple. We'll be buying another set when our next starts facing forward. A must if you like your leather seats, along with a Britax seat protector.
B00OC5BIHI|1|Just a thin piece of fabric....sloppy
B000FW2MC2|5|was every thing I expected
B003U1Q47E|5|Great replacement for my driver's side on my 2003 Dodge Ram 1500.
B00DAFRHU8|5|Awesome replacement, purchased for my moms camry when she backed into another car. Much cheaper than going thru insurance.  The quality and paint were perfect.  Looked identical to the bumper I took of. The actual swap took me about 30-45 mins.  If you have any doubts about this product, do not, you will not be disappointed. I gave the VIN and paint code sticker in a message and the car looks perfect now.
B001O77CMW|4|I am very happy.
B00N6D7K38|2|Not as bright as regular high beam lights
B00Y16E92O|4|I bought these for my 2012 MB E350.<br /><br />It fits fairly well on the front passenger side.<br />I had to trim it to make a decent fit on the driver side. You can not trim it to fit perfectly, though.<br />The rear mat is the real bad fit. It is just too narrow to fit. The ONLY option is to cut the middle portion out. Unfortunately, that undermines my purpose of buying it. I have a toddler that would step on the plush car mat hundreds of times!
B0000AXY97|5|Seems to be much better than Sta-bil
B00E5UVM5I|5|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's saved the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B00499ZFZ8|5|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's saved the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B010MHV00O|5|Finally! A product that keeps my HydroFlask and Nalgene within easy reach. The adjustable bottom fit my SUV perfectly, especially with the little strip of non-slip material that seats the BottlePro nice and tight. An added touch of stick-on Velcro keeps the bottles from rattling around. I could not be more pleased with this product, and the customer service is outstanding too! Do not hesitate to purchase this product if you are a user of Nalgenes or HydroFlasks. In the unlikely case it doesn't fit your car, they offer free return shipping. Win-Win!  #stockingstuffer
B00L8448C8|1|The metal screw is incased in plastic.  So when you tighten it down, to a good tension, you run the risk of breaking the plastic away.  This happened on one light and it fell out.  Very poor design.
B00L1LP782|4|Nice wind shield for the money but the install video was a little hard to see exactly where you were supposed to put the clamps and how to put straps on to lock windshield down because there were no close up pictures while the install was being done.  I still do not know how to strap the windshield down when transporting or riding!
B001G4Z5J0|2|First off the cargo carrier looked like it was shot out of cannon when it arrived. Multiple rips and tears in the packaging.<br />Strong cargo carrier with two major flaws. One is that the hardware is cheap and started rusting after two days of travel.  You can see the rust streaks running down the reinforcement plates. Is it that hard to buy quality hardware?  Secondly the carrier that we purchased either had too much paint on it or was too big because it was a super tight fit in the receiver of the vehicle.  Made it very difficult to get it in...and required assistance to remove.  There are other options out there.  I would likely not purchase again.
B00K5DTWWO|2|I bought these not even 3 months ago and one has already died.
B00RT3QA5U|3|Good quality fast delivery. Somewhat smaller then expected..Other down side is the mirror does not stay in place..
B00JQ6IJXO|5|Were easy to install they look great..
B000C94FPA|5|Fit perfectly better quality than original.
B0016IJ0XS|5|exact fit for pontiac vibe 2005, works with no problem
B000G0T0EQ|4|still to install in my ek3 civic
B00BCRMAAS|5|Arrived as described and fit our Jetta very well!
B00O83OBQY|1|I received my brake light in the mail opened it up and it was perfect exactly what I wanted. Put it in and 2 days later 2 of the LEDs were already out. Personally not worth the hassle to send it back...
B00HJ15AJ4|5|Good looking and sturdy frame. Adds a nice finishing touch on the car.
B00B7MW0T4|4|Exactly as expected and easy to install
B00537FHOY|5|The hitch itself is great, I had a mechanic install it on my Mazda 5.  They charged me four hours of install time.  I feel like they ripped me off, but it looks like they did a nice job of installing at least.
B004G4H6M6|4|Exactly as expected
B00JGJGLMM|5|Good quality
B006CRT72W|4|great product!
B006IV6CAW|1|No good
B00BFWQ96G|5|It came very fast and was just we expected. Still will coud't install them but we&#34;ll do BH.
B00WMHFGLM|5|Good decal looks nice. Its pretty big<br /> Will fit a decent portion of your window of choice
B004LELY6K|5|Fit perfectly for our 99 Fleetwood Prowler Hybrid. Not even our local RV store could find the right part to fit.
B00BG07QZA|5|excellent!
B00BP4V9DC|4|Product came as expected. Everything works fine. Shipping was completely wrong and was a week over. Not prime shipping but it wasnt important so its only one star off.
B003TVGUK6|5|Fit perfectly, super easy to install!  Only downside was that it took 3 weeks to receive a very small package.
B000L9T7AY|4|good
B0041I2J1K|1|No adjustability and doesn't come with new bolts needed. Bought a SIKKY brand front sway bar instead which is a much better product.
B0045Z6BM2|5|Fast shipping and works great on my 07 dodge short box.
B00SM8R04Q|5|Works great on my 01 f250 powerstroke. I use the torque app.
B001FZNIL2|5|Makes my truck have its own style
B00CI2XIOS|4|great buy and a great price
B00DZOIID4|5|I'm happy that the radiator is in my car and working good.
B003VDX5D2|4|installed quickly on my 2015 Ram 1500. works well but could be a little sturdier
B00DUFLHLS|5|Fits great, and holds the phone securely.
B00TG05LO0|5|Great Product! Fast delivery! With the Houston, TX heat, this windshield sun shade has been worth every penny. I plan<br />to purchase another one as a gift. I am a very satisfied customer!
B0007LXTMS|2|not what you think they should do
B008457ABK|4|Worked fine was a good fit. Very pleased
B000C580QY|1|item does not fit honda element
B00652G4TS|5|verry good
B008BC8EW0|5|Perfect fit and 10 minute installation.
B000CRPFHE|5|Fit perfectly and was easy to install. Mirror itself is very good and no distortion. Exactly what I needed
B001DKO3X6|5|Handy this past winter to scrap off ice. Rubber grip never slipped out of my hands.
B004BCJJO6|5|These were for my grandson,he loved them
B000GU0YFK|2|Disappointed in these pegs.<br /><br />They tend to turn with the vibration of the bike. On a long trip I had to stop every hour or so to rotate them back into place because the rubber rotated to the bottom and my feet slid off.<br /><br />Also, they come with curved washers that are supposed to keep the peg from folding inward, but high speed winds pushed them back anyway. Can be kind of dangerous fiddling around with these at top speed to get them back into place.<br /><br />I would not recommend these pegs.
B00GI789GQ|1|Wish I had read reviews before purchasing. Seems like a lot of people have the same issue:<br />1. they don't quite fit the socket for the vehicle they are intended even if they fit the wiring/connection.<br />2. They only seem to work with the brake light feature. Steady on/tail light function doesn't work.<br /><br />Wish I could get my money back and get something better.
B001A6T9OQ|5|Better than advertised, at a great price.
B006FUT05U|5|I love using this product right after I've washed and dried our cars to keep the underlying thorough wax job in excellent condition. I feel it adds that extra gloss and protection that I like to see and feel. Because it's a spray it goes on quickly - then I take a microfiber cloth to buff it off with by hand - easy peasy! Takes only a fraction of the time needed for a more thorough liquid or paste wax as you don't need to wait for the drying stage. We use it on our motorcycles too.
B0002UHVAA|4|Decent.<br />Really needs a shutoff on the drain to get very much water into the tank if it's not a straight entry. Mine has a Tee.<br /><br />It does fit inside, which no other would on my 1999 Itasca Suncruiser (built by Winnebago)
B00KQK1ZNA|1|Voltage rectifier went out on a 300mile ride, left me stranded on the highway with a blown up battery. Do not recommend.
B00WCHLD7I|5|Good product
B0091OE6II|1|Will not stay on the seatbelt. I have a much better one in one if my cars and will be finding out where I got that one.
B00R1WH6YS|4|Appearance looks good on this antenna.  I expected a little harder rubbery texture.. It bends as you drive as expected.. I noticed the first inch from the tip is a little bent.
B00L2QM806|4|works great!
B00ACDP6YU|5|So far, works great.  Takes a while to learn to use it, but it does exactly what I need it to do.
B00OPMIR2M|5|BOUGHT FOR MY STEP FATHER HE SAID IT WAS A GREAT ADDITIONAL TO HIS TOOL BOX
B0000AXQPA|4|A very nice product. Well made - will probably last a long time. Had to enlarge the opening in the boat dash, however, but it fit the new stereo (Kenwood) perfectly.
B00IG1Z7GM|4|I give the bars 5 stars, the instructions 0 stars.....  THEY ARE HORRIBLE!!!!  I put them on in a short amount of time and installed the the same day. The installation instructions need to be updated as to how to install the clips ( they go in the holes not the pinch weld). Also no mention where the rubber grommets go, there is no mention of them. I am mechanically inclined so I figured things out, they go between brace and rocker panel.  Overall, less than an hour to install and they look AWESOME!
B00APZLU6I|5|Received it before estimated delivery date, couldn't be happier with it
B00FDQPCR2|5|I have been skeptical of solar powered LED lights having had a bunch of mediocre products over the years. This one is excellent. Very bright to say the least. Seems to be able to charge in almost any light too, not requiring full sun. Easy to adjust the angle of the light and solar panel and easy to change the sensitivity of the motion detection. Also like the ability to change how long the light comes on. Good product.
B00JVHLS3G|4|Doesn't fit perfectly, it's light and feels like plastic instead of metal but it still looks good.
B00XMO5HV8|1|They sucked they where not bright enough and the box broke after 2 weeks
B0016H0O6G|4|As it happens, I used only the tail lights to replace rusted out units on my utility trailer, but I am happy to recommend the full kit itself. The parts are well manufactured; the instructions are clear; and it is nicely packaged.
B00NEX78IM|5|I love it!!
B001C6LG3Q|1|Pump defective out of box. Followed prep instructions, added oil, hooked up, plugged in, turned on and got the stalled motor hum.<br /><br />Removed rear fan cover from rear and manually turned motor with power off; normal resistance to slightly tight. Powered on and attempted to manually turn; fierce resistance in both directions. Powered off.<br /><br />Removed switch cover under handle, one capacitor wire was off. Reconnected and powered on; same result.<br /><br />Disappointed, put in for replacement. Whatever happened to bench testing a product before boxing it up for sale? Will update when replacement arrives.
B00XZ9OMAC|5|Worked great
B006B3BVP8|3|I ordered these a about 2weeks ago and just recently got back from a trip out of the country, Anyways i just got them installed and one of the halos doesn't work, is there anyway i can return the one that doesn't work for one that does?? besides that shipping was good. Only flaw was that one halo that didnt work...
B006FLMGGO|4|Came rolled up but no worries it flattened out in no time,, fits my 13 Civic well.
B007ETJGQO|5|good fit
B0011MYOCG|4|Worked for what I needed
B00UW0DF4G|5|Fit my 2010 Honda Fury - Performance increase is noticeable. Smooth acceleration and improve fuel economy of standard plugs.
B002KJT3QG|5|Fits great.. well made
B007X6IYES|5|Just what the doctor ordered.
B00YG2PM6K|5|These are TOP of The LINE OIL FILTERS,They are OEM on all Polaris ATV's+UTV'S,Also on All Arctic Cat ATV'S+4 Stroke Snowmobles,+All Kawasaki Motorcycles,SOO they are Good Enough For Me!!!!
B001UOYNK8|1|Ugh,  Stinky stuff.  Luckily I did not put the whole can of this stuff in my car.  I just sprayed about 15 seconds worth.  A cooler leaked crab water into my back seat.  I had it detailed and ozoned and there was just a little bit of smell left.  I thought this might get me through to the end.  Really not a pleasant odor.
B00X87KMEQ|5|Sounds and looks amazing. You can't beat the quality for the price.
B00480BWCI|4|I use these under a Coachmen Clipper 17BH (~4000lbs GVWR) and they hold up fine.  I do see a decent amount of bending in them, so they probably wouldn't go well under a heavier RV, but they work great for the ultralight and pop-up side of things.
B000GZBZOE|5|I thought I was ordering over the window visors. But apparently I ordered the in channel type. Glad I did they fit perfectly and easy to install.<br />I like them fine so far.
B00K1C1WC2|5|Did their job under my 4000lb travel trailer.  I'll be getting more for the truck as piece of mind...easier to keep up with than pieces of wood, lighter and better at staying under the wheels.
B000GZV904|5|I had to search high & low for this battery! I purchased it for 1986 Honda Rebel 250. It fit perfectly with posts on correct side. Once filled with acid, bike started right up & has been for 3 months now.
B00BFLVVU6|1|My battery did not include battery acid. Normally when you purchase a battery with no acid it comes with it separately and you add it. The battery was shipped without acid at all, it was slightly more useful than a piece of plastic.
B0049B12Z8|4|Looks to be well made and installed with no problems.
B003VFNZEY|4|cant go wrong for the price. I have been wearing for couple of months now and happy with them
B007XE8C74|5|Did what I expected it do do.
B00387A6TC|5|Used to protect my show cars.
B002W2V19I|5|Nice material
B00APOEWXC|5|Great product.  Not like the flimsy ones in auto parts stores.  Well worth the price, looks great on my truck.
B000C2SBAM|5|Fit my  2002  Legacy Wagon  4 cylinder.
B001P7C7QM|5|Excellent pump for the money pulls 500 microns on a a/c lines 50 ft in less then 10 minutes
B003SS62PS|3|I love it, especially since i'm a mail carrier; and we rarely use our air conditioners..
B00JGQM1WO|5|Very good oik
B000S0KY8A|5|Looked for a trailer hitch to multi task with, and this was the one.  Like the old saying you get what you pay for.  Why this may seem rather expensive look at all the trailers that are not being towed safely due to be off by as much as 5 to 7 inches to high or too low, people struggle as the trailer bounces all around.  This was money well invested.  Spoke to the actual company on the Internet chat and they ensured that I got the right hitch were helpful and very friendly.
B00X4RXP62|5|Feel the Bern!
B004Q83TGO|4|Works fine for what I need.
B00CZG1U2Y|5|Perfect
B0028JLFCI|5|had to have it in order to connect my jeep trunk cover. Very easy to install once i figured it out.
B000IOJGB2|5|Great chrome addition to your bike. Very easy to install and looks great. Very good affordable price!
B004V9JZ5W|1|They came quick and look cool but I have a 2010 Chevy Malibu and they are too small
B00EZ4L3CG|5|Very nice
B001OK6Q2Q|4|Fits Perfect
B00BHLRTUA|5|Very nice hard rubber...fits my 2013 Civic perfectly
B00063X7KG|5|This is the best clay set. Meguiars is top notch products.
B00EAOIRI4|5|Nice
B00GXKKF10|2|They are all dried up, scent is very weak.
B00KLCI91Y|5|Fit perfectly. Arrived as promised if not sooner. Very satisfied with purchase, saved me money.
B00PU0MW60|5|Very good.
B00O2GFKQW|5|Great lights good value put them on my off-road vehicle they can definitely see my brake lights now!
B001O7PNS2|5|it does the work...
B000JZZ55G|5|Good value
B00I8OK6GS|5|Perfect fit just like advertised. Also very easy to install.
B0041TR892|5|fast shipping<br />Easy to install and work 100% on 2010 hyundai sonata..
B004TOB6EW|3|Ok, it does Tote and Store but a little more thought in the design would make a huge difference. Listen to your Buyers!<br />•  it's too tall for the dump valve to drain.<br />The short hose and dump valve are full of waste and cannot go uphill to the portable tank.<br />•. What good is the included drain hose with only one connector fitting? What could possibly be your reasoning? Do you think I have an extra laying around? Am I supposed to swap one off my RV sewer hose and then swap it back later? Throw in the 3 buck part.<br />•. The portable tank won't fully drain.<br />A little design revision in your mold would put the inlet/outlet fully at the edge without leaving a quart of waste that never empties.<br />You get 3 stars for a good strong tank with quality rubber tires.
B002UC4TCG|4|As advertised. Good value.
B00CPGQ1GO|4|I keep this in my tank bag. I've used it two times when parking on wet grass. It worked well. I which I would have purchased an orange or yellow one however because that would be a good reminder when getting back on the bike that it is there.
B00XZ9OO7S|1|Didn't work and retuned
B001JT1794|1|return for refund
B000QJNA7A|5|put this in my 1996 Jeep Cherokee. has the 4.0 High Output. GREAT TUNE UP I wouldn't get anything else. Made in the USA. brass contacts and and copper plus. Good buy
B000C8Z8NY|5|Fit like a glove
B00QL1TP8U|5|Ordered this for my 87 yr old father's truck. He liked it so much, he had me order another one for his recliner in the house.  It is comfortable and sturdy.  This made it easier for him to get out of the truck and the chair.  Nice fabric and seat size.
B00LIAOUU2|4|I ordered the 10000k deep blue n ones I installed they look white but still work good n easy to install
B00S63YX88|1|Wiring way to short. Connections  for hoses  to large. Not recommend
B000M3V95U|5|I had my car waxed and now the greasy wax on the windshield would get really hazy and there would be these weird smoke streaks when I would use the windshield wipers in the rain. My car never used to do this but I used everything I could to get rid of that. it can be very dangerous to drive in the rain at night, as the lights from the other cars plus the streaky windshield makes it much harder to see. So long story short, I bought this stuff, tried it out, I did 2 very heavy coats and wiped it off with a microfiber towel. I can tell you that my windshield is clear and good as new. This product is better than windex and all that other crap out there. Truly invisible glass.
B00QRANHI4|4|I've had it my truck for a few day's now and I can tell some difference, truck had a bad odor will give more time to do it's job then let you know it turned out. Thanks
B00FLOOAUQ|5|Family was going on vacation and given the Crv has very little storage a roof rack carrier was a must. Of course I waited until a week and a half before we left. So I called the Local Honda Dealer... They want $280 dollars. Whaaaa?<br /><br />So I do some searching on Amazon and find this for around $60. Got it within a week, installed it in less than an hour. Supported a large carrier filled with all of our luggage for an 8.5 hr trip to and from.<br /><br />Couldn't ask for more
B002RSIK4G|5|fixed our leak on the rounded edge of our trailer. Works great
B009DA95M2|5|Great helmet, nice design and so far durable. Would recommend it for sure
B00N15AQ8M|5|I get stares. LOL
B005BNZGCS|5|good quality at good price.  Well made. Fits plug on trailer and receptacles at RV parks perfectly.  Solid, not cheap!  good value.
B000DINKPQ|5|This horn is amazing.<br /><br />I had a huge issue of trying to get people's attention with the factory horn my Prius came with.  I might as well have yelled at the motorists with my windows rolled up and it would have made more noise than honking with the factory gear.<br /><br />This horn ( on a Prius, you buy two ) will not only get the intended motorists attention, but every pedestrian within a 3 block radius.<br /><br />IF for any reason other than to improve your vehicles &#34;hearability&#34;, its worth it to see folks reaction to such a small vehicle sounding like a fog horn.<br /><br />I cannot say enough positive remarks about this horn.  Once you install it, lay on it a few times around the block, see the look of shock on folks faces :)
B00AIJY2ZM|5|great bright light!
B00XN1DAP0|5|Works great!  I removed the parts from the enclosed bezel and placed them in a bracket that I made to fit under the radio.  Each unit is threaded and held in by a lock nut.
B00G8UNQQ6|4|Love the kits when someone hasn't swapped used bulbs in the box back at the warehouse. 6000K matches my Daylight CFL's at home. I love the bright white lights. I don't have a florescent light anywhere on my cars, boat or home. Makes everything look more modern. Amazon still rocks though.
B00HWX7IS0|5|Bought mine at Costco also. Works great
B012YMDPHG|5|Works great!!!! Works just as good as my more expensive ODB
B00RM327NG|5|love it!!! best thing ever invented!
B00AMMCCWK|5|everyone loved my new floor mats
B0006IX87S|5|Great filter the same you would pay twice as much for at any RV dealer.  Like so much we ordered 2 more.
B003VAUQ2I|5|As advertised.
B0051POYJ2|5|The tool works great.  I would hate to have to disassemble weather pack connectors without this tool.
B000COCWIC|4|Fits in my 2014 Ford Titanium's power outlet with no problem.  The original flaps had broken off and these cover the holes and also let people know not to smoke in my baby ;) Great price.  They're a little hard to get out if they're pushed in all the way, but I just leave them up a bit.
B00GYHUF58|5|Perfect with this product
B004P20FGI|1|After about two weeks of having it installed, i noticed this morning that from use of folding cover, the leather top has started to wear and tear because the cover rubs on its own frame that is clipped to top rails of the bed of truck.
B00KMDE1SW|5|I get so many compliments on this thing!
B00CJ5E1GS|1|I made the mistake of writing off the reviews (here and elsewhere) of people stating that they couldn't get this thing to seal properly.  I [arrogantly] chalked it up to them obviously doing something wrong, and I bought it anyway.  I was not pleased with this device at all.  No matter what/how I tried, I could not get a good seal on my brake fluid reservoir and ended up making a mess and wasting most of the new brake fluid.  The &#34;universal&#34; seal doesn't seal at all, and the chains that go around the reservoir will slip almost without provocation.  I hope to find another use for this bottle because it doesn't work very well for changing brake fluid (for me and my cars.)  I ended up having to change the fluid &#34;the old fashioned way.&#34;<br /><br />This kit was not in the slightest worth the time, hassle, or cost.  Save yourself the headache and frustration, and just do a two-person brake system flush.  Or take it to a garage and pay someone else to do it.
B00VENO1MK|1|The sticker warped from the heat.
B00BFDI36O|1|This Honda Emblem is specifically only for 1999-2000 Honda Accords. Don't listen to the &#34;Does it fit your car&#34; . It won't fit. It said it was compatible with an 01 Honda Civic which is why I ordered it and it wasn't even close......it's also a very cheap plastic material.
B002H9ABXS|5|Easy to use
B00BQ01IJU|5|getting 24 MPG in 6.7 cummins now that the EGR and DPF are both gone....GREAT AMAZING TUNER!
B007V2D8IG|5|I park in the street and heard Dodge's have a bad reputation for getting a cracked dash so I bought this as protection and it fits my Durang' perfectly! My car is also no longer 100 degrees plus everytime I hop in my car. Very happy with it. Doesn't feel to be cheap either for spending $50. Only annoying thing is putting it somewhere when you arent using it...not a problem when you don't have backseat passengers though.
B00OM3F04W|2|quality of bags is what I'd expect for this price point. Brackets are adequate for install. My package included no information on wiring color codes. Obviously black is ground and the other two can be figured out by testing, but where these are inexpensive Chinese manufactured bags, the wires could be anything......I'm now up to 3 emails back and forth with the manufacturer and they still haven't been able to provide me color codes. Underwhelming experience so far.
B00EZ85XNM|5|Good quality.
B0073XNCTI|5|It works wonderfully. Thanks a bunch.
B01196JAI6|5|I bought this trash bag for my new Cadillac that my husband bought me for Christmas.<br />It fits well & looks good! I love that it has a zippered compartrment for other things. I put my make-up in the compartment.<br />Very well constructed car trash bag.
B00C7Y61HI|5|just what I wanted.  Also, ordered the wrong part first and returns were easy.
B0023VIN1M|5|Nice quality.  I went to YouTube for detailed instructions for installation.  Installation requires a little bit of skill.  I did two lights in about two hours.  Much better quality than a headlight re-polish kit.  It came with headlight bulbs installed too!
B004J2ROYU|2|In my UPS --- it did not work.  Perhaps it's not the battery's fault.  I'll never know because I quit<br />using the UPS.  No need having it plugged up if it won't deliver even a few seconds in a power outage.
B00B1VBQRS|4|Product works fine...will reorder
B0053ZTO5O|5|Good for what we used it for
B000BK806A|1|Glovers are very stiff. I used some leather conditioner but didn't really help.
B0052G5NPE|1|Everithing all right<br /> Thank you!
B00597NEYS|5|Absolutely love this steering wheel cover and belt.  I have the matching mats and it really accentuates my car perfectly.  The material is think without being bulky for durability, the color is excellent and it feels good on my hands.
B00BITIEA0|4|easy to install!
B00598U2EM|5|Great quality wrap.
B004BT6F00|3|The drums are decent but a 1992 Camaro RS has rear wheel spacers that wouldn't go down flush on the face of the drum because of the protruding flange that slides over the axel in the center-I had to grind the spacer center to clear the drum flange to sit flush on it's face
B00NDN4ZE8|5|These cloths are awesome!  I used them for my vehicles and for cleaning my motorcycle helmets visors.  Gentle but still clean great. Very pleased.
B00JBQQZMQ|5|Good quality part, i installed it on my 2000 Toyota Corolla, fit perfectly.
B00CSX42WY|1|This is junk.  I bought 2 of them for the hood, one to install and one as a spare.  The first one lasted about 2 months and the sticker just blew off.  Ya, its just a sticker.  So then its just a stupid looking piece of cheap, silver plastic.  I sent an email to the seller 2 days ago and got no response!  They are peddling junk, they know it, and will not even stand behind their junky product.  Save yourself some frustration and go buy a real emblem.  That is what I have to do now.  What a waste of time and money.
B00KJAWIJM|5|Product as described.
B00B2FPAVG|5|I was so lost in what windscreen would be best so I wanted to write a review to help out. I have a 2013 Ducati Multistrada 1200 anyone that has one will know what Im talking about its loud and a lot of wind buffeting. I got the smaller screen 14&#34; and the wind buffeting is gone completely. The screen itself is beautifully made and theres still some noise but thats on your helmet quality I have a modular and it has great venting. Also I got the dark smoke you look over it so not a problem when riding at night even in the highest setting. Just remember you install the bottom screws before the top or it wont line up. Great product
B00GHSKXM4|5|Product as described.
B00JIJ4LWW|5|EXCELLENT product!  I didn't realize how much dirt had accumulated in just a short time until I used this cleaner.  I plan to use it once a month from now on to keep the leather in good shape.  Very supportive company as well!  Will buy this again for sure!
B001FNJ8HM|5|Perfect. Replaced a missing bolt and the old factory bolt on 1995 Jeep YJ (Wrangler).
B009PBAHN0|5|My Jetta thanks you as now my windshield wipers/fluid works again!
B00YOF2TYM|5|Very Nice!
B000B6NQHW|5|I replaced the broken one on my 2006 Ford F150. It was an exact fit, electrically and mechanically. Great product.
B00RHI8V1S|1|THE CLIP DIDN'T CLOSE PROPERLY OVER THE VENT. MY CELL KEPT FALLING ON MY CAR FLOOR, I REPLACED THE CLIP WITH A VELCRO CABLE MANAGEMENT.
B009WDG9AQ|5|Works just as expected. It let me remove my stock tail light on the sportster and use the rear signals as tail/brake lights. The added bonus of the flashing brake lights is a plus.
B00T36HLYU|5|I have used CIPA mirrors on several trucks in the past 15 years and have always been satisfied. They are easy to install and remove. They are very stable even at highway speeds. Easily adjusted and stay where you put them. I would highly recommend these to anyone.
B00F4FAKDS|5|it looks just like leather.
B000V5L5SK|5|Fit perfectly, easy to install.
B00LM4OQMG|5|Best invention ever!!
B0039T0518|5|It threw me off a little bit that the generator circuit is considered to have priority, but other than that, it was easy to wire up.  The enclosure box includes both 3/4&#34; and 1/2&#34; inch knockouts for conduit or liquitight connections as well as openings in the bottom for extension cord style wire to be pulled through.  This product was less expensive compared to a competing product but I couldn't be happier.
B00NVBW5EY|5|Works great -- fits just fine in my Subaru Forester.
B00D9C2CDO|4|Bought this to travel from OH to CO and back.  It's good quality and kept our suitcases well.  It fits a lot of stuff in it and works better if you have it filled up all the way.  We had no wind noise at all the entire way.  At first we had sounds from the extra on the ties because we didn't tie them back but that stopped as soon as we tied them back at our first stop.  Went through rain and it did a good job the first day.  Second day we got just a bit of moisture inside - could be because we didn't tie it down tightly enough that day but it didn't hurt anything.  Overall, it did it's job fine.  Be aware that it's a bit of a job putting heavy things up on the roof of a van or SUV and we took our suitcases out at every hotel and had to hoist them back up in the morning.  Thus, I would recommend using this on a shorter car so you don't have to use a stool or anything.  So while it worked fine for us, we think we're going to look into a luggage carrier that hooks onto a hitch so that we don't have to hoist heavy things up.
B00XDQI032|4|These are direct replacements and work as advertised.
B00W8LQE4K|5|Fit and looks good.  Wife loves them.
B00WID0OEE|4|Great, high quality product that comes with extra blades! Only a couple things to note for use in the shower - 1. the handle is a little long making it difficult to maneuver in tight spots, 2. the blades are a little stiff so it's a little difficult to get all the droplets.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with the product though - very nice.
B009S2ZQNM|5|Very solid, easy to install, so much better than the oem plastic handle. I honestly don't know why these weren't stock, the metal handle is great.
B001T1D0QA|5|This is the only way to go for getting those headlights up to par. This was a drastic improvement in the appearance of the car....actually you don't even have to take out the headlight , remove front trim and they snap out and new one snap in ...just like magic..
B00O85JSXI|5|Shipped quick and decent price
B000WJEWVC|5|As good as the  KTM brand it replaced
B007ISGL0U|5|AMAZING!!! Matched with the flowmaster exhaust system it does not even sound like the same vehicle. Lined up next to another TC with the trd system and made him sound like he had a huffy with a can wedged in the tire. I recommend this 100%
B00T6IZFXY|5|Very Nice item and good price to boot!
B000BZL47W|5|Works great.  No two times to start, fuel gauge reads correctly.  Hope it lasts another 200k.
B00O46NBBG|5|Very pleased and it came so fast.
B006GFLI0O|5|Excellent sweat absorption, well vented across the top.
B001JKXJF8|5|Fit was perfect, good construction
B00XRUOHFY|1|Plastic chrome. No throttle connection. Don't waste your money on this... At least the grips you get from china are aluminum...  I took a chance. Very disappointed and dissatisfied with this purchase...
B002N2JW70|2|Well, this is a basic 'starter dampener,' I suppose. It's cheap, and I bought it because I'm a 'DIY' kinda guy and I didn't want to spend the $40 for the ARB Dampener when I knew I could make this one work for $5 of materials. It's made of cheap reflective vinyl, and has instructions on the (not pictured) other side. There are two pockets for weights, and small velcro strips (which really, really need to be bigger). I added a 4&#34; wide strip of velcro to each interior side running about 1.5&#34; from the bottom and I filled the pockets with sections of ziploc bags of Crossman BBs which were then covered in 100mph tape. This added enough weight that I felt reasonably confident it wouldn't fly off and kill anyone - the intent is to dampen the shock of the line snapping tension, not weight the line down to the ground.<br /><br />For the price, if you have a sewing machine and ingenuity, it's ok. For the regular consumer, save up $25 more and get the ARB dampener.
B00P27AIR6|1|Girlfriend ordered these light for my birthday and loved the look of them. But after two weeks of having them on the lights started shining less and less. Ended up the lights burned the plastic on the to where it wouldn't let light pass through. Emailed about returning them but because it was past the 30 day return period they would do nothing about it. So wasted 200 dollars. Would not recommend these lights or anything sold from Auto Dynasty!
B008UPMA46|5|Great delivery and good product.
B00841E6JI|4|Great fit.
B002G38WLI|5|Better than OEM.
B00ANWBESC|2|The instructional CD that comes with it is no good. Will not play on my computer or DVD player. So it is a self learning process.. There was no return shipping label with it. Amazon you dropped the ball there. I'm on the road all the time and don't have time to time to play games trying to return a product. When I purchace a product, I expect it to live up to the reputation it is advertised to do.
B00K1C1WC2|4|Light weight, simple and inexpensive. I gave it a &#34;4&#34; only because they seem to be made for a larger tire than what's on my 26 ft travel trailer. They serve the purpose, though.
B00KXE46BW|5|Awesome!
B00LAI0ZYW|5|customer was greatly impressed and so were we with fast shipping and easy installment
B008YEYETC|5|inexpensive replacement for factory one, work fine without leaks...
B000BYGCYI|5|to be honest i am very, very happy with this oem genuine part plus now i feel a smooth ride(just the way i like it,thanks guys. another happy customer
B000CIONQW|5|great little computer mirror, perfect so no one comes up and surprises you
B007HG7Q5C|5|Works as expected.
B00B4KTH90|5|Arrived a day early. Works good so far. Easy install. Will update if anything goes wrong
B009K6ZH6W|5|Perfect fitment into any fuse block/panel/box. This is for the normal (medium) size fuses. NOT the mini or maxi fuses. These are a great way to add an additional circuit for powering your amp, adding gauges, any circuit really versus wrapping the wire around an existing fuse and cramming it back into the panel.
B0002F6692|5|My application was very complicated because I did not remove the rear duallies.  But they are on and work very well.  I would recommend them.
B000CQDKBI|4|good tool
B00AGAGCRE|5|I love this and it's so bright
B00PGGLOWQ|5|Installation was a breeze but I was hoping for a return to the 50 mpg I used to get. Unfortunately that didn't happen but my bike starts easily and idles smooth.
B000MT7OSK|5|just what I wanted.
B0002KM5L0|5|Work Good!
B00KWGNR5C|4|Very well priced and seems like a quality product the only problem I've had is that I have had to reset it 2 or 3 times since I've bought these fobs it is a pretty easy process but I never had to do it for the original hopefully the problem won't  continue
B0009IBJAS|5|Work well!
B00O85JSXI|5|Easy to install even included all the gaskets and drain tube that I didn't know was part of kit.
B00EJPOQRU|5|Excellent and still working.
B000GARNFO|3|Covers the tires.  There is nothing quick about installing these and using the rubber bungee system.  I used them last winter and they were a pain to install and uninstall.  The directions did not make sense.  They did stay on my tires all winter, but I'm coming up with a better easier to install system for this winter.
B00JC88LDO|5|OK
B00029JXO8|5|as advertised
B001F88ENQ|5|The rotors work great with EBC red stuff brake pads because the more you brake the better the brake pads grip. The downside to any slotted or drilled rotor is the amount of brake residue left on rims, but it is not so bad.
B00NSH9IBY|5|Fit great works great
B001GN6L4Y|5|Quality USA made receiver. Bought this to add a tow receiver to a heavy duty truck flatbed I have. Great quality and well made. Bought the 12&#34; tube to have a little extra steel to weld to and reinforce. Comes shrink wrapped with label.
B0090QLOM8|5|great product
B00KVQJEE6|1|It's just a piece of vinyl fabric. I was misled by the description and picture. I needed a replacement to my console lid. I returned this fabric as soon as I received it.
B0006Z9SQQ|5|GREAT
B000CMHILK|3|I have a 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and it was difficult to fit the filter into the case. I ended up having to shave down a corner slightly by about 1-2mm so that the case can close and even then, it was very difficult to close. I am hoping that after the first cleaning, it might be easier. I wish I knew that the fit was poor and difficult, I might have purchased a different brand.
B005WXPOEC|3|Very Nice item and good price to boot and does the job better than stock one
B00R6BQANW|5|This fits in my 2004 Hyundai Elantra GLS as if it were made for it.
B00JXW0S76|1|I just wasted 20 dollars on this product it is terrible grade vinyl just don't waste your money on it
B000JFNAAS|1|Does not have 1/4&#34; threads, which should be specified in the product description. Cannot use this with my AC manifold gauges. Waste of my money and tapped can.
B001CG21PS|4|i really liked this but wish it had someone in the wizard of oz on it.  thanks for shipping so quickly
B00CLUYFNA|5|Good fit, did not snap into place like the video shows because I have the factory spray in bed liner but still good fit.
B00VHSAGGW|5|Good chain so far shipping was a little late
B000IY8OLU|5|ok
B002PUM6NM|5|Fast shipping and right adress. Thanks. Very happy.
B00SJXE9R0|5|Works well. I love it. Recommend to several people already.😀
B00NMQSPNI|4|B+
B00KTITCRU|1|never got this to work
B000C2UHU4|5|Works great, replaced oem.  5.9L 360  engine 2000 ram 1500  4x4 off road very easy install.
B00LAEEFCY|5|Great price for an oil change.  Not a lot you can say about oil and a filter, but the price is right.
B00BITIOJ6|4|my sequoia handle was cracked so grabbed this and it bolted right into place.  been working great for a month.  so far so good
B00M9WUBBA|4|Electronically and acoustically fine. The problem lies in the completely useless sticky pad mounting system. You will have to either epoxy the Velcro mounting circles in your helmet or find another creative means of affixing them.
B001RO8AD2|5|very hared to put on hemlet
B00OZP9V3S|5|Easy to install and worked perfectly!
B0002KKLI4|5|it has been approx. a month and so far so good, a/c still nice and cold
B00AD5ROFQ|5|Excellent product, works great.
B0041FCNU0|5|Good
B004RNR9QY|4|This is a nice hose, well-done fittings with solid quality.  I can absolutely see the penchant for kinking other reviewers have noted - I took a lot of care to keep it laid out with loose coils in it and pick it up slowly and carefully to keep the coils loose and not allow that first kink.  This hose wants to draw up into a kink you end up fighting that to wind it back up.
B00B51WBM8|5|Very happy fast shipping
B004I0K1KM|5|Super-quick delivery, and was simple, pop-in installation.  Electrical part connected right up with no problem.  Looks exactly like original.
B00HPTDXFS|5|great product. packaged well.
B00EIISYRQ|5|Same as Snap-On, JHW, Craftsman. Very good tool.
B00CMUDDVY|5|This item is just as I expected.
B0009V1WS4|5|Too big for bike hitch.but not worth trouble of returning.
B00C5RAU9W|5|Understand that it is not uncommon for Suburban switches to go out after two years.  Mine lasted three years.  Bought two so I would have a spare after I easily replaced the original.
B0009VF1DQ|5|Great product,... I use it all the time.
B002GO933S|5|Nice hitch
B000182DPG|5|Feel like acceleration is a tiny bit more reaponsive etc.. awaiting time to inatall the Z-Tube with it. That should help a lot. Thanks again
B0019O1BS6|4|This is the correct filter for 2008 Honda.
B0012TWXJE|5|great bag, sun is starting to fade it, but i leave the bike outside in LA. fits a gallon of milk! what more could you ask for? stays stuck to the tank quite well.
B00FLFYK50|5|Item fit perfectly for 2000 quest/villager.  However my display is burned out, so it did not repair my issue.
B000WJA5ZY|5|nothin better than RAM
B00JA3BMDW|5|Seems accurate to me. Use it on the griddle and grill.
B005JU5TUM|5|Awesome wiper! Not sure how long they will last but will be keeping my eye on it.
B00559VRDU|5|This was the first repair I'd decided to do on my own.  After doing enough research and pinpointing the problem (gas cap open message, large evaporator leak on the OBDII, sound familiar?).  Mechanic wanted $250 just to find the source of the leak.  Gosh, it felt good to save that money.  Installation was a little tricky (finding and threading fasteners blind was the worst of it), and it'll likely go faster if you have an extra pair of hands passing you tools, but you can probably manage on your own.<br /><br />If you're installing on a 2009 Chevy Impala, you're gonna need the wiring harness (ACDelco 19257603).  Ignore the automated message that says that part doesn't fit an '09 Impala.  It does, and you'll need it.  It's been almost a year since I installed the part, and I haven't had a single problem with it.
B000IYSJRE|5|Ok
B000C2CJZK|5|Bought for a 2000 4.3L vortec motor in a GMC Jimmy. Worked like a charm. Would definitley buy again if needed.
B00DHQ1C4C|5|It fit my 2005 Taurus windshield perfectly.  It is a little unwieldy to install or remove with a front seat passenger but otherwise is just what I wanted.
B001C3XD0S|5|It Fit Perfect On My 2013 Harley Trike, Multi Purpose For Cell Phone Also. PERFECT
B000AXWU50|5|Love my new Cheshire floor mats! I'm a huge Alice in Wonderland freak so these were a must for my new car! Great quality and super cute. A must have for Disney fans!
B00805YH7E|5|Absolutely stunning backseat cover! I am so happy I ordered this. I have a preschooler, and this is the best seat cover I've found to combat sticky messes and spills. Definitely worth the price. Installation takes about an hour, but allows cover to fit snugly to the seat (I drive a 2014 Ford Focus). The black leather look is very clean and professional, as well as stain-resistant. Simply wipe clean with a damp rag, and liquids don't appear to soak through the seams to the seat beneath. I have had several compliments on these covers. Great product!
B005OLOZE2|5|I have the same thing in a smaller waist size, but I needed a somewhat larger size because I carry things like a leatherman and a flashlight in a pouch on my belt.  These pants have the armor over the knees and hip bones, are very waterproof if the vents are zipped closed, and aren't too hot in summer if the vents are open and you are moving.  Don't be the dummy who wears blue jeans on a motorcyle, the pavement at 35 mph will grind right though your sking down to the bone.  Wear all your gear, all the time.
B00332GB6Y|1|Work very good
B000CPJI1U|5|Did not fit
B001LHVOVK|5|Worked great.  It scanned the codes quickly, i looked the code up online, and replaced the sensor.  All for less than the price of just the diagnostic at a regular place.
B00M9ICSF6|5|Product was as described. Great quality with easy to follow instructions. Price couldn't be beat.
B00EG8WBLI|4|the first couple times you wash it, it will run redder than the USSR in 1922
B0027I8CU8|5|worked perfect
B002PMM9N2|3|First unit I received was defective. Amazon promptly issued an RMA and two day shipped a replacement. The new unit arrived with only 3 of the 4 batteries. Once I got them installed and paired they were still not working properly. 3 of the 4 senders worked but the 4th sent no signal. I took it apart and bent the battery cage for better contact and then it worked. SO all in all the TMPS works well enough for my needs but it's certainly not one for the faint of heart to tackle. For comparison I purchased a two wheel version (but higher quality brand) for my motorcycle and it &#34;just worked&#34; right out of the box. This one needed some tinkering and understanding of electronics to make it work properly.
B00JJBWMDO|5|item as described
B005HAYDR4|5|They fit and work great.
B00SMWZC4M|4|Good Product, received in less than a week of ordering.
B00280BFZY|5|Good quality for a good price
B005617MRM|5|Easy to install and is working out great on our Rav 4.
B0007LZI8G|5|Inexpensive and does the job of protecting the trailer ball and keeping the grease off everything else
B005SUX9MI|5|This tool works very well - replaced both front wheel bearings and had no problem removing old or installing new.
B005DIV7CE|5|Great product.  It was exactly what I needed.
B00LO0M918|5|Works well and nice white light.  Just be advised if you are using them for camper ceiling lights that they are not a full 360degree light so you will loose a little coverage versus regular bulbs.
B00FQSZSEY|1|Ordered this kit after extensive questioning supplier about fit and quality....Item arrived and had several cracks, would not fit car as stated, very shabby formed product!  Was allowed to return for complete refund! However I was stuck with a return freight bill for $350.00...Do NOT buy this product!!! Feeling scammed!!! Poor fit, Poor Quality, Useless!
B001FC7DUC|5|I installed two on my motor home. Prior to installation I drove the rig on different roads (fast and slow) and could diffidently smell the sewage ordor from my tanks. After installation, drove rig again and smells were gone. So far great product. Installation is easy.
B001ABJQ3K|4|this product fit the stock location perfectly. I installed it in less than an hour with just a few hand tools. My truck is breathing better than ever.  Thank you
B00G2586NK|1|This item was no good it did not work I sent you a msg about this. I had to go buy another one. I think I need a refund on this item. I do not think I will ever order anything else from your website
B0095D34YM|5|Perfect fit!
B00LNOK4E4|2|LED has not been installed since I bought this last two months. Finally LED was installed for a fog lights. At night, the fog light looks a bright white in the first photo BUT LED looks terrible and darker on the wall, see the second photo, HID (above) is used in the headlights, look more bright than LED (below). So HID and halogen are highly recommended.
B000CF6I72|1|Not well made, Ventshade doesn't sit properly,preventing window from rolling up. i should have read the reviews first.
B00BTS7Z9Q|5|Cute and very durable!
B0019VZYN2|5|I mean they are spark plugs, what is there to say.  These fit well, well duh.  I knew they would fit when I bought them.  They came well packaged.  Sure, they are in little boxes with cardboard wrappers around one end like any other plugs you have ever purchased.<br /><br />Frankly I like these because when I put them in my Civic, and change the oil regularly with a good synthetic, I get great gas mileage.  I don't really buy the 'permanent spark plug' rumor, so I replace them at 50K miles and I generally see renewed performance, which is really the point.<br /><br />Don't forget the anti-seize, I mean you want to get them back out again right?
B00FX40B16|4|My 9 year old Prius has given me NO trouble in any way except with wiper blades. Don't know why they seem to wear out so quickly. Maybe it's our crazy climate and the fact that we don't garage the car. Anyway, these blades are performing exactly the same as the other brands we've purchased. The Prius windshield is gigantic, so if there was any skipping or other malfunction, I would have to change them. But no problems so far. Of course, it's summer and I've only had them for a month, so time will tell as to durability. I will update if anything changes.
B004IV8NBU|1|Too big for what the messerment said
B006YIVEVG|5|Does what it is supposed to do.
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Very cool.  Easy to install.  Should have bought more, and i will.  Found the same online for a little cheaper, but shipping was fast and fulfilled by Amazon so that gives some comfort. Cool and bright white lite in my interior. Much brighter, and modern than the dirty yellow OEM lights.
B000COOGIQ|4|The wires seems to be very high quality and they work perfectly on my cherokee 1998. But I give them 4 stars because the cylinders 5 and 6 came with a straight terminal for the sparkplug connection instead the L connector that is in the Mopar cables.
B001B7B3B6|5|Is very good part's and very good quality I recommend this to everyone.
B00K9E8QQ2|5|great value
B00VZP1IXW|5|This LED emergency beacon flares is the way to go these day. It comes in a compact storage black box for your 2 beacon flares and 2 stands. It not like the original chemical flares that could potential endangers you or your family while trying to caution oncoming vehicle. The each flares requires 3 AAA batteries to get it running. The LED light is super bright so any oncoming vehicle or truck will able to spot your car in no time. The cool thing about it is the base of the flares is magnetic. You can stick it on the metal base that come with it or you can stick it on the side of your car. Now, the base is really lightweight, so if you were going to set it down during inclement weather, I would highly have something to hold it down. The reason is you don’t want your flares blown in the wind. If you put it on the side of the car, I don’t see any it being blown away. I have two of this emergency beacon flares in my each of my car I owned. If something was to happen, I know I can safety warned other car of my situation. Highly recommend to have alone with first aid kit and such.<br /><br />Flare Measurement:<br />Length- 7”<br />Width- 1 3/8”<br /><br />Magnetic Base Measurement:<br />Length- ½ ”<br />Width- 1”<br /><br />Stand Measurement:<br />Length- 4 ¼”<br />Width- 1”<br />Height – ½”<br />Foot base- up to 8 ½ “<br /><br />*Received this product at a discounted price for an exchange for an honest review.
B0053P69IO|1|Cannot tow anything with it to low to ground on 2015 toyota sienna. Scrapes with nothing in receiver . So after installation of air bag kit from airlift i don't scrape any longer
B00B1VBQRS|5|UPDATE: Recently my wife's honda civic with 143,000 miles started sputtering and shaking randomly anywhere from 30+ MPH. I ran through about 50 scenarios of what it could be and eventually decided it was probably a fuel issue. The next fill up (this had been going on for two weeks) I put Royal Purple fuel cleaner in her tank and you guessed it, a couple days later it was gone. It has now been 3 months without any issues. This is the original fuel filter so I have no doubts it needs changed, but wow it's saving me from a headache for now. I'm amazed at the difference it truly made. Real results at last. Buy some!<br /><br />I am somewhat of a Royal Purple fan boy at this point. I have to say when I saw this product released I said to myself, &#34;What does Royal Purple know about fuel cleaning?&#34; I bought it anyhow. I use shell gasoline to try to keep my fuel system clean. Additionally, I run techron fuel system cleaner through pretty often because my car is aging and has never had a fuel filter... Read more
B0096T8NDW|1|Could not get it to fit my 2015 GMC. I end up sending it back and reorder the stubby for the 2014 model and it fitted perfectly.
B002ZBY9HW|1|This product sucks. It WILL fuggup your TPMS and the manufacturer doesn't care. Submitting a claim on their website is a waste of time.
B008ZPEF58|1|Terrible product, it faded in the sunlight in a matter of 6 months.  Selling war vets a crappy product is uncool.
B005OKXU94|5|Great OEM...
B00D6I1H50|5|It's very good item, good material , very useful,<br />It's saved the day,,<br />Advise you buy it.
B00SY3ZCU8|3|I have been using these for years they seem to work well and last. The only problem I have with this brand is that the cap doesn't lock down. Bad for the boat.
B008J20R1S|5|Works well just remember to use multiple coating.
B003YIM84Q|5|At first once installed the drop was not appearant at all. But it does take several days for the springs to seat into the final location and tension.  Works perfectly fine with OEM shocks. Definitely feel the bumbs in the road easier but cornering and high speed manuvuers are a knight and day difference from the oem springs. Next on the list would probably be adjustable shocks to go with these springs once the oem shocks blow out. Never could see myself buying 1000$ coilovers so this is the next best thing.
B000MD4YKM|5|works great
B000CJ427G|5|Perfect Fit. 01 Civic
B0018R89L6|5|good morning, friend before buying wanted some advice from you if indeed it is reliable and good product is remanufactured alternator and gives me personal opinion about it ... What guarantees and if it is favorable buying remanufactured or not remanufactured. thanks a lot
B006NZTZLQ|5|Works great! Small and portable, great for anyone interested.
B000JFNAAS|5|Over the past 45 years, I've done a lot of air conditioning work on cars and used a lot of can tap valves.  I am also a manufacturer of machined metal components.<br /><br />I've used inferior cast zinc ZAMAK ones, that old timers called &#34;pot metal.&#34;  I have the expensive Master Cool one selling a nearly twice the price.<br /><br />This one is about the same and works just as good.  The bar handle is fine.  The cast round garden hose bib chrome plated &#34;faucet&#34; like handle is not necessary and even adds to bulk in the tool box.<br /><br />The best ones, like this one, are machined from solid hex yellow brass bar stock like good pipe fittings.<br /><br />This is such a good deal,  I bought three (3) of them.
B000G76SKI|5|perfect just the replacement my boat needed
B003VLBPJA|1|Very poor. Quality  Made for a bicycle  Low quality elastic. Smells so bad I can't keep net in my house.  Amazon should not sell this item.  If I could give zero stars I would have
B0125W64PA|4|Great decal but I should have asked if it was white or black, background or not. Knocked off a star only because all other decal sellers usually  specify in the description.
B00192LGYC|5|PROS:<br />This filter-back replacement fits up perfectly.  The pre-welded hangars line up exactly with the existing hangars.  Nice finish on the steel and the chrome tip (so far) has not lost any of its sheen.<br /><br />CONS:<br />The fastener on the tip really has to be torqued to hold the tip in place.  I thought the welded nut was about to break off!...but it held tight and everything is solid.  Installed on a 2008 Ram 2500 Mega-Cab.  If you have a Quad-Cab Short Box, you will need to cut the straight section to fit.  If you have a Quad Cab Long Box, you are good-to-go since the chassis is the same as the Mega Cab.<br /><br />MYTHS:<br />This kit will NOT add horsepower, torque, or fuel mileage.  The difference in sound is unnoticeable.  I bought this to replace the factory tailpipe which had rusted through just aft of the factory resonator (muffler).  This option was cheaper than a dealer replacement and looks nicer.  the &#34;muffler delete&#34; section of the kit replaces the factory resonator whose sole purpose was to knock down a specific resonating frequency from the exhaust note.  The factory resonator was a full pass through design with no restrictions or backpressure, which is why removing it doesn't change your performance or exhaust note.
B000I04Z7Q|1|Came in the mail and only the red light worked and was very dim very dissapointed
B003UVCY00|2|Works great for a year, then quits working.  I used mine for duck hunting, and not much else; keeping it in the door of my pickup and using it sparingly for other things such as fishing.  It puts out a decent amount of light, has a decent amount of charge hold, ect. all decent.  The problem is that it just quit working altogether after about a year after I bought it.
B002SINBRQ|4|They're not quite long enough if you're car is in a driveway facing away from the street and need a jump from behind (no jokes here...:)<br /><br />Otherwise they work great.
B00MHZ0EXE|1|Stopped working after a week of use. Cheap quality, bulky.
B00SR1QEAY|5|Works as it should
B000GBIQ54|1|2 days later broke.
B004ZIUGVG|2|Provided the faintest suggestion of heat while moving at highway speeds.
B00B9HFO0Y|5|Works great!
B00ECGWRHC|5|Easy install and the watch is great!
B005EKY1EM|5|This is the best small lead-acid battery charger out there. It is temperature compensated (a MUST!) and has a desulfating mode (also a MUST). It protects you against battery reversal and a bad battery. The old version had a selectable charge current (this version does not).
B000C2WEKA|3|The product arrived promptly and was exactly as stated in the product description, but it was too small to fit the male end on the pipe coming from the engine...
B00FRHOI86|5|These wipers are so easy to install....easy on the arthritic fingers and no broken nails, too! I also use the Rain-x washer fluid, been using that for years. So even the hardest downpour doesn't slow down this old girl.
B00429NKWK|5|Best kit I have every used. Needs a lot of elbow grease, but in the end my wife's headlights look as good as they did off the sales floor.<br /><br />No need to look further, this is the best kit out there.
B010DLK3DY|5|Fits perfectly on a EJ6 civic
B003IOKPLO|4|just what i need to trouble shoot my car . works good
B00AYXM4DY|5|Product as described.
B00PEYHDMA|5|Mirror worked great, easy to change, and was tinted which I didn't know, and really great at night when the lights are shining in it. Really like it.
B000IG3QNY|1|Didn't fit my sun visor as advertised.
B00MNQU9GO|4|These look nice in our 2001 Ford Ranger Edge and are well made, but I've never found seat covers that really fit.  There are always wrinkles and not enough ways to tighten the material over the seats.  The covers were easy to install...especially easy with two people.
B00K889FCI|5|PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED
B003VYVFSS|5|Great product, great price, fast shipping!
B000VHXEJ6|5|Great stuff, Tuff,thick,does work,will line kitchen cabinets as well.
B004BSNO8W|5|Fast ship--had no trouble making my Honda A/C blow cold again---hope that it holds for the summer--have some left to top off system if needed.<br />Thanks
B001AWDX92|5|best batterys for the money, last for many years
B00C5RBRA8|5|I did not read the description carefully enough to notice that it said 2-10ft hoses.  Yes, you can connect them together but I was looking for one hose but overall a good product and a whole lot cheaper than buying them at camping world.
B00H4W50IO|4|replaced a broken one
B00514BPGI|5|Good product
B000BOCAMQ|5|way cheaper than a new tail light, because who fixes things the correct way anymore? In all seriousness, this stuff will keep you from getting a ticket while you're waiting for your new tail light to come in
B003YI421I|5|best.glue
B005NLQAHS|5|I used to use a scan tool that cost a lot more that was USB to Serial wired. I like this a lot better, Bluetooth to my Windows Phone. And cheaper in price too. Have not tried it on Bluetooth on my Laptop yet.
B00P2K08J6|5|Was exactly what I expected and has worked fine so far
B002U6IL9O|4|This seat warmer is fantastic, but I had to deduct a star for their slightly deceptive picture.  I was under the impression there were two seat warmers and was not happy when only one showed up.  It was too late at that point to order a second one, so we only have one installed in our car.  To be fair, they mention in the description that you'll need one kit per car, so this was mostly user error.  But the picture does make it seem like you get two.<br /><br />However, that aside, the seat warmer works very well and was easy to install.  I would gladly buy another.
B008Y9K0OU|5|Fit perfectly on my 2003 F-150!
B004AH4O9W|5|Always purchase bussmann fuse rather than the unknown brand name.. When you plug in the car charge on lighter and the high power HID/LED with no built-in resistor or capacitor, the current spike always has chance to shoot the cheap fuse, even though the current draw is in range.  The The ampere tolerance of bussman fuses are more in range. I have a habit as an electrician/mechanic that I put dielectric gel on the blade before I plug in the fuse.
B00B9DZKDE|5|Bought this for homebrewing beer.  The water tastes great!
B0009IQZH0|2|Don't use these on your paint.  Save them for your wheels and/or glass or for wiping down the interior.  They become hard and scratchy the first time you wash them.
B00GSAUHB8|4|I have a two door sports coupe and the windshield is completely covered. It does reduce the temperature, but with 100 degree summers and high humidity, it is impossible to keep a car cool anywhere in our state. I would purchase again and it is superior to the rectangular cardboard folding shields.
B00ODDKGV8|5|Got the job done.
B00BYH6C1E|5|Fits a 2015 Tacoma double cab
B003TG8D2E|4|Not as good as my older one
B00JBNYZJO|5|I was going to replace my brown garage door because I thought the colors were deystroyed by UV Rays.<br />I decided to try cleaning the door and that helped done; then I bought this and they look great; I thought it wouldn't last or dust would stick to the door in no time.  Neither has occurred the doors still look great after spraying and wiping this product on the door.  It's a vynil garage door.
B00PA0N9G2|5|Great looking
B000CQTKVC|5|Very good, quality product, fit and finish is excellent.  Excellent fit on my application.
B007TXXXDM|5|Good product.
B00D9C2CDO|1|Not at all what I expected. Looks like it would tear within one trip. Sent mine back. Didn't even use it at all because I felt like it just wouldn't hold up
B00K4GKSRA|3|Bought these to replace the cheap factory lugs on my 2103 ford escape. They fit well and looked good. However after a little more than a month they are showing rust in the grooves. So not happy with the finish.  Still prefer them over the factory equipment. I may look around for another set from a different manufacturer and see how the finish fairs.
B0082X2R30|5|put this on my Hardtail, rode to Sturgis and back 2278 miles.  sure made jumping the bridges alot more  comfortable.  Less than half the price of the ones they were seling at Sturgis.
B00FD90XJ6|5|Love it, looks so cute on my little car
B000N3H8FO|5|Absolutely solved the problem.  Used an aftermarket gasket previously and it blew almost immediately.
B00YBGA8U6|5|Perfect for a 2016 Forester Chevy.  Easier than expected. Nice design. Keeps the windshield cooler.
B0010FVSZA|5|Nice quality, it fixed my vibrating brakes!
B0050LU2GQ|4|I really like the way I don't have to work hard at making them stick.
B007H2Q01M|5|so comfortable and roomy
B004PC5GTO|4|Love the mirrors but left one must of been cracked had on bike a week and it broke in half
B00TO7MXG4|5|I love these new black hubcaps. Much better than the plain boring grey ones that came stock on my Nissan Versa. Installing was a breeze. They are quite snug and still remain on my car. I don't know what people are complaining about. Must be the user if you ask me if you are having issues. I have enclosed a pic so you can see the end results. I would buy these again.
B0049U8MR0|4|Replaced original Motorcraft coils with these on my 1992 Ford Crown Victoria. Took me 15 minutes to install. Seem to work well at the moment.
B006VDHR5G|1|grate product for my needs
B004JBCENW|5|original,oem,genuine,factory installed parts( this is what im talking about) thanks guys
B0002F6804|1|Do not purchase! I called Atwood and they said because there is NO SERIAL NUMBER there is NO WARRANTY. They told me it was probably a remanufactured unit and all Atwood water heaters should come with a switch and a new door.
B00C5WPZ4W|5|Excellent
B00EXFTPYK|5|Great product. Love the sheen on my motorcycle
B007O0L1FM|5|Very good top quality.
B0092D23WE|5|Good glove for the price
B0112Y8GUI|2|Pump died 2hrs after being installed on day 1 of a 5 day trip.  Had to buy an OEM pump from a Cummins dealer near our camp.
B00PUNMOJC|4|PRODUCT AS DESCRIBED
B00GSNAHSI|5|Instructions could be better describing how to remove the Jeep's wheel well plastic fairings. I have used the baseplate for a month now and I feel it meets all my expectations. I am a structural engineer, and I feel it is very well designed to tie into the vehicle's structure.
B000IYPNC8|5|Perfect fit on my 1990 Miata. Can't beat the price. As others have noted, if you have a MT, just ignore the AT cooling section.
B005CLMRE4|5|I would buy another for the other side.
B0023VKXAG|5|Perfect identical replacement.
B0019CJ5Q8|1|\\"Will Not Harm Plants or Grass - Feel secure with our organic Rusterizer that your grass and plants will not be damaged.\\"  Bull F'ing S***!  Killed the grass just off the sidewalk and killed my wife's Petunias, all that and did a poor job of removing the rust spots!  Won't buy this again!!!!
B0007THS5E|5|Best work mats ever.
B001EOYIJK|5|Mounts just like the directions say super simple to install yourself can do it on one hour and that's including wiring would recommend this product to a friend
B009F49NP0|5|I love this little compressor.  Fills a tire quickly with the inflation accessory kit.  Works for lots of little projects as well.  Was easy to mount, came with great instructions and the wiring harness so that I could wire it up to my Jeep.
B00F3I9IPM|5|These were bought as spares
B00NLULY9M|5|Amazingly bright on F150 third Light. Way better than the cheap plastic alternatives.
B000GRY6BG|5|Word out excellent
B001L9KI56|4|cool
B013MKW2AU|5|Amazing product. Fits in my 2005 Evolution RS like it was a stock part from the Mitsubishi. Great company to do business with. Fast shipping and good contact. I upgraded from my 60mm Gruppe-S panel to this and it looks much cleaner! Buy this now while you can because these will go quick and are almost impossible to get your hands on. Cleanest way to mount your 52mm gauges.
B002NAMJHC|5|They are bright as new. Easy to install too.  Wish I had done it years ago. None of those head light cleaners worked at all on my OEM lights. Save your money and get these.
B000HNL86A|5|It's been two years of Michigan winters and swaps between summer/winter tires. Still looks like new. Nice solid lug nut. way better than the crom cap nuts from the factory.
B011D67O6W|4|No installation instructions are included, but hey, it's not rocket science. I emailed the seller and they emailed me a copy, if you need them. All the correct hardware was in the box. Once you figure out the brackets, it is a breeze, check on youtube for an install video. They look nice and are functional.. They seem to be durable.
B00T1RPR9W|5|Worked great
B004F63RYQ|2|the size is awkward. it doesnt stay secure, and it doesnt fit well in the back floor.
B003RVRQJW|3|The key works fine in the ignition, but the key fobs for unlocking the door failed after three months and still does not function. I have changed the batteries three times
B00A4ABF8W|4|Great product, easy to use and you get great results of used properly. My only complaint about it is that the pads are too small. It needs a larger surface area. It takes a lot longer to do your entire car with a 4&#34; pad vs. a 6&#34;. Other than that it's great and highly recommended. Especially for touch up jobs.
B00LOZN03O|5|These are size 1/2&#34;-20; that is, 1/2&#34; thread size and 20 thread pitch, with a 60 degree conical taper (where the nut meets the wheel). They are driven by a 3/4&#34; wrench.<br />I bought these to replace 2005 Jeep Wrangler TJ stock lug nuts and they fit perfectly.  From what I could find, they should fit all stock Jeep YJ ('87-'95) and TJ ('97-'06) Wranglers, and I believe the XJ (Cherokee) as well.<br />My originals were chrome and they had been corroding for years. They made creaking noises during hand tightening and loosening, and stuck so badly that I sheared off a lug trying to change a tire.<br />The zinc finish is great: turns smoothly and doesn't stick at all.
B00CMP3Z4E|5|BUY THIS! Worth every penny to just keep in your car. I've done several jumps without re-charging. I keep this in my wife's car which gives us both the peace knowing that she won't be stranded somewhere in the dark.
B0002F66GA|5|I ordered this for the spare tire on our open car trailer. It is a 15&#34; rim-classic trailer tire. This is easy to fit on, while not loose. We have now used it for over a year with no issues (though we thankfully haven't had to use the spare tire). The color has not faded, though it has been stored outside the whole time. Even while traveling, the cover remains in place. This is a great way to protect your investment.
B00B3L2DQO|5|Perfect
B001DRNNHG|5|Great...2003 Saab 9-3 Arc
B00CPYFOVY|5|It was perfect.
B00153XSWI|5|Timken is a very reliable seal. I've always used the Timken brand when replacing the front inner wheel seals on all of my vehicles. The only reason I'm replacing the existing Timken seals is because I had to replace my front bake rotors and the new rotors required new seals. The old original Timken seals were still working just fine.
B000C7W02M|5|perfect match,great product.
B004Y3VPWG|5|fit exact 1968 p30 van, great
B003TMTB56|5|good price over dealership
B00HUI1EQ4|5|just what I needed
B00KC8JYGQ|5|Work great in Tahoe fog lights. Can't find better product for price
B010H0QV7S|5|This is an Amazing tool to keep in my glove box YOU just never know what is going to happen while your out on a Family outting or just driving to the store, This is a 5 in 1 that everyone should have The device takes 2 AAA batteries (not included) The white LED light is bright enough  to see what ever you point it at. The Red Led light is very bright as well. Has a nice clear able to read led screen for testing your tire pressure. A VERY sharp seat belt cutter. And a glass breaking tool. Very well made, Not a light fake plastic like most you can buy.VERY happy to have this sitting in my glove box.<br /><br />I received this product mentioned above for free.<br />This is my honest opinion and I hope it helps in you decision weather or not to purchase the above item..
B0016J3YG6|4|What  I needed
B00WRUEMN2|1|This product was very very very poor. First off when u look down the car all you can see is the warped & rippled plastic, second the lines arnt even straight & edges are very sharp & will slice your fingers if you slide them down the crooked line & my fingers are calused do to working on cars for a living & as a hobby. Third, the damn tape they use sucks they are already falling off & ive only owned the car for a few months & had these visors on for maybe 3 months. Do yourself a favor & spend the money on the real ones. I've had vent shade rain guards on my 04 monte carlo since 05 & only had to replace the pass side because I had hit a mailbox & the mirror broke the visor, i left the driver side alone when i got the new ventshade visors because it wasn't even faded after a decade & the tape is still holding strong. This product add was very misleading & of very poor quality. Thankfully I dont have kids because they would've def cut there fingers if they didn't fall off first.
B00AHRHVT4|5|excellent very happy purchase
B00JB4ZFTC|1|Didn't last very long. The plug on the phone side came apart. Junk
B0004ELKC4|5|Good!
B007PP2PAQ|5|I had to make my own spacer so that it was tight but, gosh, I love this thing.
B0012FKF9S|3|Love the concept of these hooks for our camper awning. However, when installing them or trying to move around the little plastic pieces tend to come out from behind the fabric and get stuck in the track and the hanger comes off when this happens. And the plastic is lost in the track! They should be secured better to the inside of the hanger. Good concept but not impressed with this product.
B00E5PK740|5|This battery is absolutely unbelievable, I hit the start switch and it turned over so quickly the bike never sounded so good. It outperforms the factory battery by light years. I would highly recommend, this battery for anybody they won't be disappointed in the slightest. Fellow riders can't believe the way it starts now. Super Job Throttle X. You got a WINNER..
B00JGRAP3K|2|The discription didn't mention it is for 7/8&#34; diameter handle bars. Doesn't fit mine which are a 1 1/4&#34;.
B00TGAG6GM|5|All i can say is the guys at Alpha Vinyl are awesome my first one came and the decal was ruined the fluid had soaked everything. i called the guy up and told them how it was received! they put one in the mail and i received it faster than the first! Thanks Guys you number 1 in my book.
B00O28W0L8|5|Finished off the sill plates very nicely. They protect the whole plate and plastic sill cap inside the car which is nice.
B007HRN4N4|5|Perfect, just what my vents needed.
B003M4OAY8|2|This parts says it replaces part #693551 so I bought it assuming it would be an even trade. It does not replace it because I have a Briggs and Stratton engine with #693551 as my starter and it has 16 teeth, so it doesn't work! False advertising!
B00V6Y5AP4|2|It says &#34;It's diesel thing you wouldn't understand.&#34; It is missing the &#34;a&#34;. It isn't even English.
B000EDOSKQ|5|Smart to purchase when buying a replacement vent! You wont regret it....especially when you go to a rv supplier and pay double for it!
B000C42QJ2|3|Package was missing the bolts and only one of the struts came in a box, it looked like the other one was a return.
B0055DNDPG|5|Bought these to work with All Balls Fork Seal Kit 55-107 for 1986 Honda Rebel 250. They arrived promptly in original packaging. Product is highly rated by other reviewers on this site and other sites.
B004D5S2KI|5|I use these. They have never failed. I feel you get what you pay for. I use with synthetic oil. Bob oil guy gave great reviews on testing these filters. If you now his website you know that matters.
B004RCX91E|5|Works great and the price was unbeatable
B0026Y81VS|5|Great product easy to install and use
B000CON4MU|5|works great on my 2000 ram
B00WH1ZC80|4|Very happy with product. Keeps bags off car floor and up where you can find them.
