B0000000LI|5.0|I have come to love Yanni's artistry since I first saw the PBS concert a number of years ago. Since then I have purchesed all of his works and can only implore to anyone considering this purchase to please do so!! Yanni can only be described as someone who can truly touch the soul. His compositions, arrangements and the artists he surrounds himself with reach out to you in ways that this writer finds nearly impossible to describe. &quot;LIVE&quot; is a great first CD to start your collection with as you will get a taste of the pure energy and emotion that is YANNI!!!

0679879269|4.0|I have grappled with whether or not I consider this series to be appropriate for children and have concluded, after reading the final installment, that it is not.  The first volume, The Golden Compass, received the Carnegie Medal, the highest award for children's literature in England.  Other than having pre-adolescent protagonists, the books seem far too intense and mature in theme for most children of that age. Parents who are concerned that Harry Potter is the antichrist (and I adore the Potter books!) need to steer their children far from His Dark Materials.  Pullman is a masterful and gifted storyteller, but his objective seems to be to promote his atheistic point of view.  As the grandchild of a Church of England clergyman, Pullman is well acquainted with both the scriptures and the liturgy.  He has turned his back on his Christian heritage and has created an alternate, twisted humanistic theology in which God (the Authority) is a fraud and is ultimately destroyed, Enoch is portrayed as an evil, villanous killer-angel, and yet an innocent sacrifice is required to overcome death.  Pullman celebrates the wonders of human flesh perhaps without realizing that some followers of Christ recognize the great advantage and blessing of the human body as the temple of God with eternal potential. Pullman's concept of triumph over death involves a dispersion of atoms into the universe, rather than the reuniting of spirit and body in the resurrection.  His storyline borrows from Christ's adage that &quot;the truth will set you free.&quot;  Pullman has stated that his purpose in writing His Dark Materials was, in part, to provide an alternative to the religious propaganda such as what C.S. Lewis has written. (See the cover story interview in October, 2000 School Library Journal.)
B000001F5F|4.0|This record is a snapshot of a band that was still young enough to create music as pure energy and experienced enough to execute it well.  Most noteworthy on this 8-song recording are the pounding opener, &quot;Gloria,&quot; an unapologeticly scortching version of &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot;, and two superior tracks not found on their previous studio albums, &quot;11 O'Clock Tick Tock&quot; and &quot;Party Girl&quot;.<br />HINT:  And if you cannot get enough of U2 live circa 1983, check out the recent &quot;Sweetest Thing&quot; single which has live versions of &quot;Twilight&quot; and &quot;An Cat Dubh&quot; from the same Red Rocks performances of 1983.
0812551508|4.0|To those of you who don't want to read Frankenstein because it seems scary - it's not. In fact, it is book with a profound theme.  It's a book with romance, some suspense, many twists, and a some sad scenes on top of it all. After reading this book, the reader either sympathizes with Victor or the monster.  I thought Victor wasn't an extremely complex character who just has to deal with the wrong choices he's made. This book wasn't extremely dry, only superfluous in some parts. I admit, I just read it for my 8th grade English class, but it was one of the better classics I've read for school.
0593044703|4.0|I think this was a really good book if you read all. I almost  like sime other reviews a read game up on it after the first  100 pages. In the beginning its hard to really get a feel for any of the charecters and Erikson switches to a new one just as its gets excating. <br />After a slow begining the book really picks up pace the charecters get a little more alive and the story begins to  pick up pace. <br />The end is really worth waiting for where everthing happens at once i'm really looking forward to the sequal.
0385495315|4.0|The fine popular science writer Simon Singh (author of _Fermat's  Enigma_, about the proving of Fermat's Last &quot;Theorem&quot;) has just put out _The Code Book_, a quick survey of the basics of cryptography from a historical perspective.<br />Singh's book is an enjoyable and well-done overview of the basics of cryptography.  He begins with a story about how Mary Queen of Scots was doomed because her crypto was bad, and continues up to the present day.  He describes the 16th Century French Vigenere cipher, World War I cryptography, including the Zimmerman telegram, and lots of detail about Enigma.  There is a fascinating side branch into the related issue of deciphering ancient languages.  He does a good job describing the Rosetta Stone and the work in deciphering that, and a good job discussing Linear B.  The concluding chapters discuss computer based cryptography, particularly the Data Encryption Standard, Public-key Cryptography, the RSA algorithm, and Pretty Good Privacy.  I was a bit disappointed in the final chapter, on Quantum Cryptography, which didn't explain things as clearly as I would have liked.  Their is also a set of ciphers in the back, and a contest for readers to try to decode them.<br />Singh does a good job describing the characters involved, in the best tradition of popular science.  And though I've known a bit about this subject for some time, he still taught me lots of new stuff.  I was particularly surprised to learn that British researchers had invented both Public-key Cryptography and an equivalent to RSA several years before the more famous inventor, but that the British government had classified their work, denying the researchers credit for their discoveries.<br />This is a sound, entertaining, and informative introduction to the basics of cryptography.
B00004R99F|5.0|The editorial review says that the movie is strictly for young kids-- don't believe it. I'm 14 years old and A Goofy Movie is still one of my favorite movies. I truly think this is the best Disney movie that has ever been made. The songs are catchy, the storyline is something most teens can identify with, and the level of animation is excellent, as is the voice acting. Why this movie wasn't a bigger hit than it was is beyond me.
0375704027|5.0|Another reader remarked:<BR> &gt;Read the Birnbaum translation a few years back., <BR> &gt;Reviewer: A reader from Portland, OR USA<BR> &gt;I don't know why people are using such esoteric language to<BR> &gt;refer to a book that was so simple and straightforward.<BR> <BR> &gt;Honesly, it really showed me that feelings of alienation or<BR> &gt;displacement aren't just an American phenomenon. Not everyone is<BR> &gt;happy and you just have to live with whatever comes your way.<BR>    <br />I don't doubt it. I can describe the Birnbaum translation in two words: Aw Full. I originally read the novel in Japanese and enjoyed it very much. When I picked up the Birnbaum translation, I thought we had read completely different books. Where the original was subtle, poetic and sensitive, Birnbaum's translation was crude, vulgar and over-the-top. I hope Jay Rubin's translation is better, but I can't imagine it could be worse.
B000001F3C|4.0|Following the somewhat immature 'Boy' (1980) and the fragmented 'October' (1981), U2 seemed to solve an identity crisis with 'War' (1983), its rawest and most passionate release to date.  Aside from 'The Joshua Tree' (1987), this is easily their best studio record of the 1980s.  Here's a song-by-song:<br />1. \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\".  Conjuring the image of a fateful day in modern Irish history, this tune is the perfect beginning to what is decidedly a political record.  Because the electric violins give me painful memories of Dexie's Midnight Runners, I prefer the version on 'Under a Blood Red Sky' (1983).<br />2. \\"Seconds\\".  This is yet another politically charged tune (this time pointed toward the threat of nuclear war) with the Edge on vocals.  (Did you notice?  I didn't the first time.) <br />3. \\"New Years' Day\\".  This breakthrough single is my personal favorite on the record for the unforgettable bass line and the great lyrics subject to multiple interpretations. <br />4. \\"Like a Song . . .\\"  Another angry, passionate, political rocker, with no apologies.  On the other hand, if you found yourself watching the old U2 videos with Bono waiving the white flag and thinking to yourself, \\"Oh give me a break\\", you probably will not appreciate this tune as much.<br />5. \\"Drowning Man\\".  This ambient gem, often played on AOR stations, a standout on such a raw record, would ultimately be a sign of things to come (i.e., 'The Unforgettable Fire' (1984)).<br />6. \\"The Refugee\\".  This one is pure pop fluff, very 1980s and perhaps, a bit dated.  Again, there is a political tinge to the lyrics.<br />7. \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\".  This is an underappreciated pop song and single from the record with some great guitar work.<br />8. \\"Red Light\\".  For this one, U2 borrowed the backup singers from Kid Creole and the Coconuts.  Enough said.<br />9. \\"Surrender\\".  This tune is another attempt at ambience, but it is not nearly as successful as \\"Drowning Man\\".<br />10. \\"40\\".  In a rush toget out the studio door, this version of Psalm 40 has become a frequent visitor in the U2 live set, mostly as an outro to other songs.  As with 'October' (1981), U2 were not afraid to be overt in their Christianity, despite the \\"uncoolness\\" of it.
B000001ELR|5.0|I got this CD the other day. From beginning to end I loved it. War Machine, I Love It Loud, Keep Me Comin', and Creatures Of The Night are fabulous. I just can't describe how cool this is. I listen to it everywhere. War Machine was even heavy enough to be covered by White Zombie. If you get tired of Destroyer and Alive! get Creatures Of The Night, And Rock!
0399146253|3.0|Patricia Cornwell's first few books were great.  I read each with great anticipation, to learn about Kay and Lucy and Benton and Marino.  Then, her books started to get weird.  They were angry and bitter.  The story became unimportant.  What became important was the interplay between Marino and Kay/Kay and Lucy and neither of these relationships was rational.  In the Black Notice, the weirdness was taken to an extreme.  I looked forward to the Last Precinct and for the first half of the book, I was not disappointed.  The story of Kay's emotional catharsis was excellent and well written.  I thought that we were on track to getting back to the story and getting rid of the anger.  Well, the 2nd half of the book does not hold up to the promise of the first half.  There were plenty of opportunities to make the 2nd half great, put Kay in a strong position for future books and take the story to a new level.  Ms. Cornwell fails to achieve that.  Too bad.  I would certainly read this book if you are a Kay Scarpetta fan.  Just dont expect the excellence of the first few novels.

6305810109|3.0|I purchased this movie &quot;sight unseen&quot; because I had seen previews and had read a little about it here.  While I think Richard Farnsworth did a beautiful acting job,  and it is certainly a breath of fresh air from some of the films that are out and about today, I was disappointed that it did &quot;grab me and take me in&quot;.  While I thought Farnsworth's acting was great, as usual; I've seen Sissy Spacek put in more effort in other films, but there were parts of this film that dragged along and there were a few scenes, when he had set up his trailer/tent in the back yard of the folks who help him when the tractor breaks down, that didn't make sense.  The scenes were filmed far away and though the actors were talking you couldn't make out what they were saying. I suppose these scenes had their purpose in the movie, but I found them annoying. Also some of the scenes ended quickly and strangely as though it was cutting to a commercial (as you would see on television--fade to black).  Overall, though, the message got through and it was an inspiring film. Richard Farnsworth deserved an award for his performance.   I just don't think there is anything in there that reaches out and embraces you. Even the several scenes that showed the country side were a little boring (rows and rows of wheat fields (?).  Even the scenes where he gazes at the stars looks unreal (too many stars) and you could tell some of them were laid over top another field of stars.  I agree with another reviewer that the musical score was not up-to-par either.  It's not something I really would want to watch again and my teenagers both thought it was a &quot;little boring&quot;.   I agree.
B00002NDB1|1.0|This is perhaps one of the worst rock/metal CD's of the 90's, and certainly Maiden's weakest release. Not only because Blaze's voice is flat and boring compared to Bruce Dickinson's (one of the greatest vocalists of rock music) but also because of the songs that sound very flat, very uninspiring..very boring and totally un-Maiden. I think that even No Prayer For The Dying is better than this album.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt is a great cd, just overplayed.  Facelift was much better but this cd is still worthy of owning.  Them Bones is a great opener anchored by Staley's wailing vocals.  Hate to Feel is undeniably the masterpiece of the album, finding all members playing at their best especially Cantrell.  Sickman is great just for the screwed up bridge, and Rooster, Angry Chair, and Would? are all classics.  If anything, Jerry Cantrell's guitar work is underrated, but on the whole Alice in Chains has simply produced some very slick and accessible &quot;hard&quot; rock tracks.  I don't know if they broke up or what but it's been a long time since we heard from the boys!
B00004XONN|5.0|Given, the album is completely different from the bands previous body of work but that does not necessarily correlate a decreace in beauty. Truthfully i was expecting a bit of a let down after reading some of the reviews but to my delightment i was stunned by the amazing tracks of this album. the album is not just a collection of tracks put together but a true album from start to finish. the album is indeed an evolved ok computer, but no less than what ok computer was to the bends. my favorite tracks, however difficult it may be to select only a few are 1,3,4,6, and 10 but all are equally brilliant. sorry oasis, but after this album radiohead can truly claim to be the best band in the world.

Which were two awesome moves.<br />It is hard to describe what emotions the music can instill in you, and even harder to understand how everyone can't see it.  This is music for life.

0316743003|4.0|If the title alone does not evoke some curiosity, the lucrative writng skills that Ben R. Rich and Leo Janos display are sure to get you interested.  As a former member of Special Operations Command and a proud veteran, I found it interesting to note how the authors showed the capabilities that our nation's technology has attained in a short manner of time.  The authors clearly state what the facts are without eliminating the once held &quot;top secret&quot; information to their readers.  Once read, reality will sadly sink in to the minds of the readers.  However, if the authors made some gesture to the younger generation then the book would receive a five star rating.  In retrospect, one might find it essential to actually be a participant in the military to appreciate the full content of the book as well as the authors intentions.
0792846338|5.0|There comes along only once in a lifetime an actress as talented and as magnificent as Kathy Bates.  Recently, I saw her in the marvelous Bravo show INSIDE THE ACTOR'S STUDIO...she is just plain brilliant!  This film, along with DELORIS CLAIBORNE (also starring Ms. Bates), are probably the best adaptations of a Stephen King novel to the screen to date.  The direction, by one of my favorites-Rob Reiner, is impecably paced for the suspense and humor that it contains.  James Caan, another actor I have loved since BRIAN'S SONG  and THE GODFATHER, is equally great as the long-suffering novelist who is terrorized by Bates' character, Annie Wilkes.  Let's just say that this movie is a tour-de-force of horror, humor, and pathos.  Superb in every way!
0394712803|5.0|Some years ago, I found a strange looking book in my favorite bookstore - it was an old paperback in a very bad condition, an oversized book almost 40 by 40 centimeters with a very beautiful, dark cover. The book turned out to be a book that was written about the movie &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot;. But unlike other books of this kind, this book did not show me pictures of castings, stages, cameras and other about-this-movie-material - this book told me a story about a time long gone by. It had wonderful illustrations of mystical creatures and places and long stories about the creatures of the world of the dark crystal. Id did not tell the story of the making of this movie - it told me the story of the world of the dark crystal, about it's creatures and about the wonderful worlds of Brian Froud. With it's rich illustrations and stories, this torn old paperback won a special place among all my books.

0060976624|4.0|When I first sat down to read \\"Thank you for Smoking\\" I was a little concerned that the controversial topic would take away from the fun in reading.  I am a non-smoker and didn't know what to expect after reading the title.  My opinions about tobacco are strongly rooted and I believed that no amount of humor would cover up the truth about tobacco in my mind.  Christopher Buckley proved my preconceptions to be wrong, however.  The novel was hilarious!  I often found myself laughing out loud.   I love the irony brought into the situations of the novel, from Nick being covered with nicotine patches to being framed by his boss.   While reading about the Merchants of Death and their weekly rendezvous for lunch, I found myself wondering about the people who actually hold these positions.  I found myself often believing that the situations in the novel exist in the world of marketing and advertising today.  I would not put it past the major industries to do some of the things that Nick resorts to in the novel.  I know that there are a lot of jobs out there that people wind up doing to \\"pay the mortgage\\" and not really enjoy doing.  After reading this novel I can't see those people as the \\"bad guys\\" anymore.  I honestly rethought my views on many of the advertising agencies that use sex and drugs and rock and roll to sell products.  Whatever works!  Buckley's satire was amazing in that it is meant to be ironic and purely fictional, but it had the effect of a literary masterpiece on the way I saw things in the world.  All the same, I had more fun with it than any other novel I have read in years. Overall, the novel was a fun and fast read.  What a change from reading works by Faulkner and Hemingway.  I realize that a book does not have to be deemed \\"canonical\\" to be a good novel.  I recommend it to many of my friends as a way to escape the often mundane and dry reading we have to do as college students.  Being a non-smoker and having strong opinions about the tobacco industry did not diminish the enjoyment I had reading the novel!
B00003CXB2|5.0|This is probably the best movie I've ever seen!  David  Lean was superb in directing this biography about T.E.  Lawrence, a British intelligence officer sent to the  Middle East during World War One.  I consider him a hero  because of his dedication and accomplishments he made in the middle east during his journeys.  The cast used in this movie is outstanding in playing their roles. I just find it very hard to believe that it isn't  available on DVD at this time.  I look forward to its  release!
6304806442|5.0|This movie delves into the days of a life of a junky.  Where things that would embarass and even disgust a normal person are of little oddity to these Hardcore drug users.  But there is more to this movie than just drugs.  There is a unique outlook on life and the actual power of friends.  In the end the friendship they had wasn't as strong as they believed.  I recommend this movie highly and won't spoil any of it for you.  Enjoy the film.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Not quite the departure it's been reported, on Selmasongs Bjrk adapts her everything-plus-the-kitchen-sink style to six songs and musical overture from Lars Von Trier's film `Dancer in the Dark'.  \\"Pastiche\\" is what it was called in the old days.  The industrial clatter of \\"Cvalda\\" turns into a toe-tapping Busby Berkeley homage.  A leaving train becomes the insistent rhythm of the aching Thom Yorke duet \\"I've Seen It All\\".  Due to the restraints of film narrative the lyrics, with help from Von Trier, are more straightforward than usual, which frees Bjrk to concentrate her prodigious talents on an  extraordinary vocal performance.  Reports from the set were that she and Von Trier came to loggerheads due to the painful nature of the story (at one point, she left the film), but you can hear Bjrk's joy in every syllable of these songs, her absolute love of old MGM musicals, and her own goofy imagination.  Much as I admire her, her solo records can be a chore to sit through.  This soundtrack is all bliss.
0060976624|3.0|In Jeff Buckley's Thank You for Smoking Nick Naylor is struggling to save his job from his boss's sexually aggressive assistant. As head of pubic relations for a big-tobacco funded research institute based in Washington D.C. Nick is a relative no-body until he leads big tobacco in a media offensive.  Nick takes center stage on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; and &quot;Oprah&quot; attacking &quot;neo-puritanical&quot; America's assault on the freedom of smokers, and in a risky move promises an ad campaign to combat teenage smoking, funded by big tobacco.     The most entertaining aspect of this book is Nick's perspective. We get to experience the pro-smoking side of the battle.     Buckley masters the question twisting, blame shifting, and finger pointing language of politicians which Nick uses to defend big tobacco. In the process Nick wins the favor of &quot;The Captain,&quot; the head of Nick's company. &quot;The Captain&quot; proves to be Nick's only friend, much to the chagrin of BR (Nick's Boss.)     Nick finds himself at the center of a true capital hill scandal. Under investigation by the FBI, Nick is forced to figure out who tried to kill him with an overdose of Nicotine. Nick sidesteps the law and tiptoes around his Boss who is waiting for an excuse to fire him in order to figure out who wants him dead.     After  &quot;The Captain's&quot; death Nick's only friends are his M.O.D. squad buddies. The Merchants Of Death squad consists of Nick from the cigarette lobby and his friends from the alcohol and gun lobbies who are all fighting the same battle against &quot;neo-puritanical&quot; America.     In the real world of Capital Hill Buckley paints the portrait of a man struggling to maintain his friendships and his relationship with his son. Trying to sort out enemies from friends turns out to be no easy task for public enemy number-one. Nick turns morals and values on their head in a story which written in '94 serves as somewhat of a prophetic glimpse into the Tobacco lawsuits of '98, and a counter point to the popular film &quot;The Insider.&quot; <br /> Thank You for Smoking is a humorous book that makes a great light read. The writing is lacking when it comes to great literary talent. But, if you want literature go read Dickens.  If you want an entertaining pre-bedtime read, read this book.
0679879269|2.0|I have read and re-read the first two books of this trilogy over the past few years, waiting for this third and final installment with great anticipation.  i could not be more disappointed. Not only does the book drag with too many characters and too many scenes (I felt the Golden Compass had not a wasted word), but the author's goal in the Amber Spyglass is disturbing and upsetting. It does not seem that Pullman has thought through the logical consequences of his a-theology.   In fact, throughout the trilogy, I as a reader have been frustrated by the arbitrariness of the rules which govern the universe Pullman has created. Finishing the Amber Spyglass, we understand better the arbitrary nature of his realm, but Pullman does not really have a foundation for any rules at all.  There is no rhyme or reason to daemons or the underworld or the consequences of travelling between worlds. There is no ground for his &quot;reality&quot; and so no way to believe in how his characters deal with the reality he has created.
B000002HH2|5.0|I just got my first Bjork album. Before now, my only exposure to her had been Kristy Yamaguchi's figure skating routine to It's Oh So Quiet several years ago. (That sentence may reveal more about me than I'm comfortable with, but so be it.) I liked the song, the juxtaposition of big band with Bjork's intermittent screams, but didn't really think about buying a Bjork CD.<br />Now that I have one, however, I reeeeeeeeally like it. Hyper-ballad is one of the most amazing songs I've ever heard, lyrically, musically, and any other -ally you can come up with. Cover Me has an experimental feel to it that fills out the rest of the sometimes-overproduced-sounding tracks, and Enjoy is just plain good. I don't really care for Headphones, but it's the only one, so I'm not complaining. (And who knows, maybe it'll grow on me.)<br />Speaking from experience, Post is a good introduction to Bjork. It certainly made me want to run out and buy all her other albums!
B000003TA4|5.0|With the opening guitar riff of the Generation X anthem &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, Nirvana fired a shot that woke up the music world.  With Kurt Cobain's apathetic lyrics and actual melodies amongst a punk like musical barrage, Nirvana touched a chord with teenagers and 20-somethings of the time. Songs like &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Drain You&quot;, &quot;Come As You Are&quot; &amp; &quot;Breed&quot; spoke of the malaise and indifference that was felt at the time.  The baby boomers of the 60's were growing old and their kids didn't quite feel the love, peace and happiness they felt.  &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot; shows where the line was drawn as the song opens with Kris Novoselic mockingly singing the hippie anthem &quot;Get Together&quot; before launching into machine gun burst of nilhistic rock.  The music may seem old today as so many band's rode the grunge gravy train, but when it was released in 1991, Nevermind was as innovative as any record ever released and it was to the 1990's music scene what Sgt. Peppers was to the 60's

0060976624|5.0|One never quite knows whom to feel sorry for -- the very antagonistic protagonist, the very pretentious public health interests, or us all, the very disillusioned public. After a few hundred pages, all three seem a little seedy, and a delicious love-hate relationship is born. <br />Christopher Buckley takes the reader into the heart of postmodern darkness, the top hired gun at Washington's fiercest pro-tobacco lobby, who -- as he continuously points out -- is only trying to pay his mortgage. The brilliant verbal jousting and tumbling plot twists leave the reader slightly appalled, and unless you're dead, very, very amused. <br />Buckley captures the idiosyncrasies of interior Washington perfectly, as landmarks roll through the pages, both institutional (a wonderful send up of the Washington Times, which is already pretty easy to laugh at) and geographic, with story line that tours the Capitol's least impressive monuments. A roll-around-on-the-floor funny sex scene, portrays love in a city with a power fetish perfectly. <br />&quot;'Ooo,' she said... `Ah', he said...&quot;<br />Rarely has evil been portrayed more tactfully, and Buckley is such a master of pacing and plot development that even in the midst of the full-throated cynicism of the K Street trade lobbies, all the characters come off as human, despite just about everything they've ever done. The novel just oozes wit, and it gets hard to put down.
B000001E7T|5.0|Two years ago I got a 10 disc changer for my car, where I listen to almost all my music. I put this CD in and it has never come out. TBYML is fascinating, alternating between dark, simmering blues and all-out punk. &quot;Down by the Water,&quot; perhaps the most heard single from the disc, is a mastery and yet another of PJ's water metaphor songs. &quot;Long Snake Moan&quot; and &quot;Meet Ze Monsta&quot; are my two favorite TBYML tracks, although there aren't any I don't like. (I had a hard time with &quot;Teclo&quot; and &quot;I Think I'm a Mother&quot; at first, but now they blow me away, especially &quot;Teclo.&quot; Give 'em a while to grow on you.) Feminsim is just the tip of the iceberg; PJ explores deeper questions of religion, motherhood, abandonment, and identity that make the superficial themes of Britney and her ilk seem not only ridiculous but soul-less. <br />While this is not my favorite PJ album, it's an incredible piece of art and music, and rightfully deserves the accolades its gotten from Spin and various other sources.
0064400018|5.0|You can never get tired of reading about this adorable family living in the woods. I first read this book when I was in third grade. Now, six years later, I still enjoy re-reading it. No other book can compare to the wonderful stories in this heart warming book. I recommend this book for people of all ages. You are never too old to enjoy a sweet little book like Little House in the Big Woods.
B00004X01U|2.0|I love the first song and several of the others songs are not bad.  Some songs are bad.  Bad lyriks, irritating techno sounds.
B00004XONN|5.0|Upon first hearing Kid A, I was stunned by the radical departure from their guitar-rock of the past (which I also enjoyed immensely, BTW).   It took many many listens topped by seeing the concert (Greek Theatre in LA) for the amazing majesty of this album to really sink in.  <br />Since seeing them live, I have listened to Kid A, OK Computer, and The Bends several times.  And as I listen to the older CDs, while I still enjoy them immensely, they are finally starting to sound that way -- old.  I now believe that Kid A is an absolute success as it sounds like a more mature, classy, and innovative band than The Bends and OK Computer (let us not talk about Pablo Honey - it was &quot;refrigerator buzz&quot; as Thom York says).  Kid A is Radiohead at their latest and greatest - I absolutely love listening to the album now more even more than I did OK Computer and I highly recommend it to curious listeners -- with this warning - you must give it time to sink into your mind.
0375704027|4.0|A simple tale made memorable precisely by its simplicity, 'Norwegian wood' narrates the saga of Toru Watanabe, an unassuming Japanese youth, who falls in love with his dead friend's girlfriend. The main theme of the book is Toru's patient wait for Naoko to fall in love with him and the sensitivity he shows in coming to terms with her broken psyche following the death of her beau. Along this seemingly unending wait for Naoko, Toru comes across Midori, a fellow student who adores him. A beautiful girl who likes getting drunk and watching dirty movies, Midori lights up the otherwise depressing book with her out-of-the-world antics... Its hard to not to smile when you read about this girl who, when drunk, likes climbing the roadside trees and falls asleep in the loo in the middle of the night!  Reiko's another intriguing character... she's Naoko's fellow inmate who, despite her personal trials and tribulations, tries to bring about the union of Toru and Naoko. In this seemingly simple love-story, Murakami has ensured that no character in the book seems out of place... in fact, it is a pleasant summation of all of them that makes Norwegian Wood eminently readable.
B000002IJA|5.0|If you've been tempted by snippets of AC/DC's crunch-rock but hesitate to take the full deep-end dive, this is about as good as it gets for a short intro of the post-Bon Scott era. I'll leave it up to you whether to dock a star for excluding the title cut from &quot;Back In Black&quot;; for me, including &quot;Sink the Pink&quot; atoned for it. Remember - if you're looking for the meaning of life in the alleged lyrics, don't even think about it. But if you're looking for subtle-as-a-trainwreck rock and roll which makes damn near every heavy metallic meathead which followed them look even more limpen despite their greater sophistication, here's where to begin. Maybe the Metallicas can outplay them, but AC/DC can out-rock them; aside from which, give me any three notes off Angus Young's shuddering-to-squealing guitar solos off Kirk Hammett's or Dimebag Darrell's entire catalogue. (It's the taste and feeling, stupid...)
0780631684|4.0|If you liked &quot;Scream&quot; you're probably going to love this<br />death spectacle as well. This is a pretty well-done teenage movie that<br />confronts fate in a unique, if somewhat unbelievable manner. The main<br />character, Alex, has images of his plane blowing up before departure<br />to France with his high school class. When he causes a scene on the plane, he, as<br />well as several classmates, are also removed for various<br />reasons. Imagine everyone's surprise when the plane actually does blow<br />up just after takeoff.<br />The premise is really just an excuse to kill<br />off the survivors one by one, justified by the weak philosophical idea<br />that you cannot truly escape death when it is out to get you. This<br />gives a really great excuse to watch people die in really incredible<br />and dramatic ways.<br />For the DVD, there's also a good feature that<br />allows you to watch some of the audience testing that took place for<br />the movie. You get to see what changes they made and understand<br />how the movie was tailored to better suit its audience. I really enjoyed<br />that as it was something I had not seen done before.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Absolute garbage. <BR> No words can describe the pure disgust i have for this horrible record. <BR> Listen to something from a musical genius like Billy Corgan's Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails, or Radiohead. <BR> Very disappointing. <BR>
B000002J0B|3.0|The 4 wild men from the UK are back with another hit. Good music, but not my favorite album. Sample this Zep cd, before buying it. Not as good as LZ 2 and/or LZ 4, but still a solid album.
B00004XQP4|4.0|I got into Green Day pretty late on through my brother (after listening to stuff like Blink-182, etc). But I liked them so much I went out and bought six albums,  (seeing as how this doesn't quite compete to Nimrod- I'm not sure anything could- I've only given it four stars). So I was delighted when I heard they were releasing a new album, and was CERTAINLY not disappointed when I bought it on the day it came out! It has so much variety, from the 'Time of Your Life'-esque 'Macy's Day Parade' to the, erm, Levellers- esque single 'Minority' and the punk-pop 'Church on Sunday', it's clear Green Day still haven't lost it. The best track is probably 'Blood, Sex and Booze', or 'Misery', both of which are really different and unusual (and have great lyrics as always). They may have changed their style over the years but they still sound great!
B0000029AP|4.0|I usually settle for compilations by these guys.  However, this CD is loaded with prime time material.  No More No More, Sweet Emotion, and Walk This Way rock hard enough for me. My Ten Inch Record strays towards some good old boogie woogie and You See Me Crying is a damn good ballad.  The filler is very minimal so fans wanting to learn more about these guys can start here.
B000002LSV|4.0|Rock music has 3 guys from TX to thank for their great sound. ZZ TOP is plain and simply put, rock n' roll. Not a must have, but worth listening to. Most men love their hits, but some women enjoy them as well.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|This CD may have not been Van Halen's top seller.  However, it is their most creative work in their batch.  With a dark and eerie tone throughout, Eddie, Dave, Alex, and Michael provide with catchy riffs, ear grabbing lyrics, stylish vocals, and a backbeat that is steady throughout the CD.  Eddie makes some very creative  use of the synthesizer on several of the tracks which only adds to the style of the band.  Whereas the sound is still quite heavy and hard, there are many dynamic elements that stand out on this CD such as the muted tone of When Push Comes To Shove, the background vocals and percussion effect on hear About It Later, and the many spoken word dialogues of Diamond Dave throughout. This is the hidden gem in Van Halen's collection and it should be owned by anyone claiming to be a fan of this band.
B000002IZ4|3.0|STP creates some good alternative rock music. This album has a few hits, but &quot;Core&quot; is a much better album. Please, do yourself a favor and sample it before you buy it!!!
B0000026VZ|3.0|OK, of course the big hits are here, there's no sense in reviewing them since they're well known.  I just can't understand why they can never do a decent job compiling &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; for these guys.  <br />Why in the world is the entire &quot;Isolation&quot; CD overlooked - I'd add &quot;How Does It Feel&quot;, &quot;Holyanna&quot; and &quot;Stranger In Town&quot;.  Where is &quot;I'll Supply The Love&quot;?  That great song was all over the radio.  Why is the &quot;Fahrenheit&quot; CD so poorly represented - I'd include &quot;We Can Make It Tonight&quot; or &quot;Could This Be Love&quot;.<br />Even the double CD import misses key tracks.  Will someone ever get it right?  C'mon, this isn't rocket science!!
B00003CXDG|1.0|Mi2 just steals from bond movies,so clich, pigeons..etc. Seems to me that people who thinks mi2 was original and good action movie, havent seen much films, or they watch only films that are &quot;hot&quot;.. MI1 was much better.. Woo has surely lost something,imagination.
0345409671|2.0|I don't get it. I really, really, really don't get it.<br />What's the point?  What does this book have to do with the rest of the Vampire series?  Why does Ann repeat the obvious facts we already know about these characters (that they're beautfiul, full of themselves, etc.,etc.,etc.)?  Why is Lestat such a dull character now?<br />I enjoyed the character of Memnoch greatly, but what exactly was the point?  This whole thing wasn't so much a story as just one long philisophical theory, which is fine, except it ain't all that brilliant or origional, or even well written.  Lestat acts nothing like himself and more or less every character seems ignored with the exception of Memnoch himself (and we see maybe just a bit TOO much of him)<br />At least the ending kept me captivated, if only for a few minutes; and at least &quot;The Vampire Armand&quot; added some depth to this nonsensical rubble of a story.  Also, the storyline that takes place involving the daughter of one of Lestat's victims was fairly interesting as well.  I fail to understand what Rice was thinking overlapping these two stories (which, with one or two tiny exceptions, have NOTHING to do with each other) and turning everything into one big mess.<br />Oh well, at least the writing was excellent, as always<br />(But then again, I HATE the way she writes as Lestat.  The boy's been around for what?  300 years?  You'd think he'd know decent english by now...)
0679746048|4.0|Imagine a story about a person going to a mental institute after only 15 minutes with a doctor.  Well this is a true story about a girl that gets her &quot;life interrupted&quot; because a doctor assumes she is mentally insane and sends her to a mental institute.    Susanna Kaysen is a 17 year old girl that wants to enjoy her life as a writer and not go to college.  This story took place in 1967 and it was very unusual not to go to college and so an assumption was made that she was psychotic.  Her parents really wanted her to go to college and become something she didn't want to be.  The author uses very good voice and explains everything very thoroughly, it is written by the person that lived it.  This book is a bit unusual compared to any other book of the same genre.  You get a look at a bright young girl that gets sent to a mental institute because she wants to live her life differently then any other person.  The author uses an unusual format. This is a bit complicating compared to most books I've read because the book jumped around a lot from different subjects to another.  This book has been made in to a movie and I really enjoyed each of them equally.  I recommend this book to any female that enjoys real life drama.  I found that most males didn't enjoy the movie and since the book is just like the movie I don't think they would enjoy the book.
0060976624|5.0|I was relieved when I saw the book Thank You For Smoking on my class syllabus instead of some boring textbook.  No one knew anything about it, but a comedy about such serious topics sounded interesting.  I just hoped the politics wouldn't overwhelm the humor.  But after reading the first line I was hooked, or perhaps more appropriately \\"addicted,\\" to Buckley's writing style.  This is a great book. Thank You For Smoking plunges readers headfirst into the dark, two-faced world of the tobacco industry.  The protagonist (or antagonist?) is Nick Naylor, whose job as chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco studies is not unlike that of a mass undertaker.  His line of work requires him to be an absolute weasel, but Naylor is a natural.  He's willing to sink to despicable lows to promote tobacco, and he eventually pays the price for his outright shamelessness.  The book begins at the \\"Clean Lungs\\" conference, where Naylor isn't exactly Mr. Popular, with one of the speakers blatantly comparing him to Satan.  He is despised by the crowd, and as the reader quickly learns, the majority of the American public.  But Naylor remains composed throughout the conference and throughout the book, for that matter, and before you know it you're on this scumbag's side.  Buckley has done an excellent job in making the bad guys good, and the good guys bad.  He even has you rooting for the devious heads of the alcohol and firearm industries. Nick Naylor is fighting a losing battle and he knows it.  He must remain strong to keep from losing his job, but it's hard to fight the facts everyone knows all too well:  smoking isn't good for you.  In light of the evidence stacked against smoking, even his opposition has to agree he's got a tough job.  But Naylor is a warrior, and his excuses and public antics are laugh-out-loud ridiculous.  Buckley has created a character whose ability to shift the blame and react quickly to criticism is almost superhuman.    I enjoyed this book immensely.  As I was leafing through it now to refresh my memory for this review I kept catching myself reading whole paragraphs and pages.  As clich as it sounds, it's hard to put it down.

0790743132|5.0|I love everything about this movie, and it gets better everytime I see it (which is currently about once a month).  But, as a piano player, I ,of course, love the song &quot;As Time Goes By&quot;...this song was written long before &quot;Casablanca&quot; was ever produced.  I'm so glad the producers decided to use this song because it encapsulates everything a love song, or a pop song, or a dance song should be....it can be made into any &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;style&quot; one wishes to make it....and it suits &quot;kid&quot; and Rick so well in this gorgeous classic!
B00004XONN|2.0|If this were not Radiohead, nobody would be buying or listening to it.  And that's a fact. That said, &quot;Optimistic&quot; is a great, great Radiohead song; the rest sounds like you're listening to a seashell or to white noise.
B00004XMTC|5.0|M has retired. Q is gone and the 00 section is almost obsolete. This is the world of Never Say Never Again. Bond is older and the new M disaproves of his methods so Bond spends most of his time teaching. But when 2 nuculear warheads are stolen by SPECTRE Bond is called back into active duty to locate the bombs. British intelligence believes they are in the Bahamas. This leads Bond to Largo a powerful millionaire (and deep down psycotic) and his mistress Domino. With only 1 week to find the bombs Bond must seduce Domino and defeat Largo all before his martini glass runs out. Highlights: Fight in Shrublands; Q's labratory; Domino's massage; the motor bike chase; and the fight in the tears of Allah.
B00000IL1K|5.0|I put this in the player and played it almost nonstop for days.  I am always impressed with Sarah Brightman and each cd of hers that I buy tops the last.  All of the ones that I have bought were just amazing.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD was the best of the year. I like how they combine rap\hip hop\ and rock all into one cd. I myself am a big rap fan. But I found myself liking Limp Bizcuit. The CD is strong from start to finish. My favorite songs are #3,6,9,10, and 14. Limp Bizcuit is trully a good group. I like this CD even better than Signifigant Other. Sorry Sean, but this CD is better than the Eminem's Marshal Mathers LP.

0553108034|5.0|George R.R. Martin has taken a fundamental fantasy plot-style and made it his own.  His characters come to life and keep you glued to the pages waiting to see what happens to them.  I have read thousands of science fiction and fantasy books - this series is definitely up there on my list of favorites.  If you enjoy getting your monies worth from large volumes of excitement, this series is a must add to your list to read.
0679879269|5.0|The Amber Spyglass is a classic- not in the narrow sense of the word that we've come to associate with the word, overused as it is. This book is a true classic- beautiful, grand and thought-provoking. <br />The book expands on the universe created in the first two books and elevates the vision of the series. No longer the simple adventure story in the Golden Compass, or the tense mystery of the second, the Amber Spyglass creates the sensation of events rushing past and a universe at war, always swirling around the two children at the book's heart.<br />I don't know what the editor or publisher was thinking when he classified the book as Young Adult. As readers have said, young people (although I hope not all of them) will miss a lot of the book and the underlying theme of losing 'paradise'. Those who do will find their beliefs (if they are Judeo-Christian) challenged (I believe this is a good thing, personally). The book is less about Paradise lost then Paradise gained. Pullman beautifully portrays Will and Lyra as Adam and Eve at the end. Their 'fall from grace', in this book signifying their maturing and falling in love, is portrayed as a good and beautiful thing (&quot;humans coming into their full inheritance&quot;). The ending also leaves a bittersweet and melancholy taste in the mouth that affected me a lot.<br />As for those who feel young people shouldn't be allowed to read this book, you are underestimating them. Those who will get the underlying message will be smart ebough to think carefully about them. If you think the message of the book is wrong, that is no reason to ban it or stop it from being read. <br />I would recommend this book to pretty much anybody who wants to think and be awed. This is book is for those people.
0060931671|5.0|There are two kinds of people who like Thomas Pynchon, the way there are two different kinds of people who like chocolate: those who *like* Thomas Pynchon, and will froth endlessly at the mouth telling you exactly how great a writer he is, how Gravity's Rainbow, V, and the like are THE greatest novels of the post-war era, how reading him simply forces you to think about life, America, and so on, in a whole new way, how vitally important all this is, etc. Other people, as the saying goes, would just as soon have some fruit. I used to fit in the third category: those who simply didn't see the fascination.    <BR>       I can't exactly tell you why I bought Gravity's Rainbow, but I can remember it was one of the biggest literary media blitzes of the early 70's: my copy has the full die-cut, gold-toned treatment of a Major Bantam Release. I can remember diving into it, getting three or four pages in, relishing the conceptual hijinks of the banana breakfast, and then getting thrown back aground a few pages later. Subsequent trials yielded an appreciation of his skill with song lyrics and limericks, his love of the perverse, and of fairy tales, but no real interest in the book as a whole. Throughout the years, I've had numerous &quot;countercultural&quot; friends tell me how much they would like to see me read it, only to be utterly shocked at my assessment of him as impenetrable. OK, guys, he uses allegory and symbolism, he sides with American intellectual progressivism, and he's a conspiracy fan. But where's the plot? the characters? Any kind of book at all? It's enough to make me dig out real-life OSS propagandist Cordwainer Smith. (Come to think of it, I didn't like anything else I read of Pynchon's..until...) <br /> I just told that story to tell you this one: I *like* Lot 49. Let's lay aside the symbolism, the allegories, and the weird wordplay for a minute -- despite the wacky names and farcical turns, this story is not only compelling, but believable, if only because we aren't presented with cut-and-dried explanations and moral stances. Was there, in fact, an illegal courier system (here called Tristero, or the WASTE system) in the electronics business in California during the 60's? Were there similar systems using the same name elsewhere, here and in Europe? Were they all the same organization? Is the Tristero system responsible for murders and assassinations? Is this all just a joke? Who knows? The case can equally be made that Oedipa Maas is a) uncovering a secret organization, b) being led around by friends and employees of her recently deceased (maybe) ex-boyfriend, c) slowly going insane, or d) simply a victim of odd circumstances. In this story, Pynchon's gift for writing songs and poetry help to flesh out the general versimilitude: if you listen closely, you can hear the music the acid punk band plays, the speeches of &quot;The Courier's Tragedy&quot;, and the dramatic soundtrack to &quot;Cashiered&quot;. Written just before &quot;the counterculture&quot; went from being unrelated-except-by-age political activists, rock &amp; rollers, and psychological researchers to a unified coalition of radicals, Oedipa Maas is neither a pawn of the military-industrial complex nor is she a stereotyped hippie-manque. She's simply a nice Californian housewife whose husband works for the local AM radio station and whose old boyfriend wanted her to sell off his stamp collection after he died, and whose subsequent adventures led her into very murky (and skeleton-infested) waters indeed. My belief is that he wrote this book, got a lot of praise for its &quot;literary&quot; qualities, and then decided to concentrate on those instead of on writing good, readable stories.<br /> To me, one of the most interesting things about the novel are the very real-seeming glimpses of the transistor era in Silicon Valley -- the egalitarian camraderie, the way that ingenuity and intelligence is rewarded just as much on the loading dock as in the boardroom. In real life, a few years later some people very much like them decided to use computers to set up an alternative means of communication between large military and research facilities that, for a long time, operated very much like Tristero. You're using it now.
B000000WG4|5.0|I grew up listening to Tubular Bells, so perhaps I'm a bit biased... but even today I still love this album as much as I did when I was a kid.   The music is gorgeous and unlike anything else I've ever heard (not even similar to other Mike Oldfield albums I've listened to).  Part one is my favorite of the two tracks.  I would recommend this CD highly to anyone who is open to instrumental music.  It's an amazing work.
630382790X|5.0|\\"Houston, we have a problem...\\"<br /><br />In April 1970, a radio transmission containing these words crackled back to earth from the tiny Apollo 13 spacecraft, which was carrying three men on a quarter-million mile journey to the moon.  Spoken by the spacecraft's commander with a deliberate calmness, these words alerted the world of  a deadly accident which occurred nearly 200,000 miles from earth... an accident which literally threatened to maroon the three passengers aboard Apollo 13 in space for all eternity.<br /><br />In 1995, Imagine Entertainment released \\"Apollo 13\\", a wonderful motion picture directed by Ron Howard.  This film masterfully dramatizes those harrowing seven days in April 1970, when the world watched and waited to see if the Apollo 13 astronauts would return to earth safely, or be lost forever in the vast ocean of space.  Based upon James Lovell's memoir of the flight, \\"Lost Moon,\\"  this film brilliantly recreates all of the tension, the high drama, and the heroism of that fateful week.<br /><br />\\"Apollo 13\\" is an outstanding film in every way.  The acting is uniformly superb! There is no question that the dominant performance in this movie is turned in by Ed Harris as the irascible, focused Gene Kranz.  In every scene in which Harris appears, he simply towers above the other actors.  His performance is stunning in its realism and accuracy.  Tom Hanks brings an wonderfully easy-going, almost \\"aw-shucks\\" demeanor to Jim Lovell's character.  Bill Paxman is excellent as the quietly intense Fred Haise, and Kevin Bacon shines as the somewhat impetuous but extremely competent ladies' man Jack Swigert.  Kathleen Quinlan suffers beautifully as the superstitious Marilyn Lovell, a woman who seems to have had about enough of being an astronaut's wife.<br /><br />As with all Ron Howard/Imagine Entertainment films, the technical aspects of Apollo 13 were, for the most part,  outstanding.  Ron Howard's direction provided scenes which were very effective in heightening the film's overall sense of drama while realistically conveying the gravity of the crisis at hand.  I thought a couple of scenes surrounding the launch of Apollo 13 seemed to venture into the realm of the over-dramatic, and came close to stretching reality to its breaking point. Most other scenes - most notably the sequences where the spacecraft has broken radio contact with the earth - are wonderfully sensitive and poignant reminders of the emotional toll being wrought on the astronauts, their families and friends, and the men at Mission Control who struggled so mightily to ensure a successful resolution to this crisis.<br /><br />\\"Apollo 13\\" is an important movie which accurately depicts one of the most harrowing events of the 1970s.  Sandwiched as it was between the American army's incursion into Cambodia in early April  and the killing of four students at Kent State University on May 4, 1970, the Apollo 13 mission has largely been forgotten.  This superb film brings that event - which Gene Kranz called \\"NASA's finest hour\\" - once again to the forefront, and restores the players in this real-life drama to the pantheon of American heroes.heightening the film's overall sense of drama while realistically conveying the gravity of the crisis at hand.

B000002KJQ|5.0|With their first two albums, ZZ Top had provided an indication of where the band was heading - three man, guitar driven rock with percolating rhythms and a certain unique sound. But with the release of Tres Hombres in 1973, the culmination of their vision was reached. <br />It wasn't just that the songs were catchy and accessible - for many looking for more of an edge, that almost was a negative. It was that in each three minute burst of creativty(I believe only one song clocks in over four minutes), a complete panorama of sound was produced. While the tracks are all obviously ZZ Top, they still are distinctly different from one another both in style and composition, and the album travels from one peak to another.<br />But let's cut to the chase on why Tres Hombres stands tall. Simply put, Billy Gibbons guitar-work was as inventive and original as anything produced in the last 30 years. And, as previously noted, he did it without the luxury of extended settings. Bending single notes, chording, slide-work; they all contribute to the surprises found around every corner. Gibbons will start a solo, insert a break that slows everything by half, then finish at original tempo with a different sound. Other times he ends the song with a 2nd solo that fades out when it appears to be reaching it's zenith. I guess it's to keep us wanting more.<br />One still wonders why the album is so short. Isn't there a \\"Tres Hombres - The Complete Master Tapes\\" with additional cuts waiting to be released somewhere? Let's hope so.

Listen to any track on the box's discs from WHO'S NEXT and then listen to the remastered WHO'S NEXT from just a few years ago and the difference will amaze you.  I can stand for the sound to be a little wooly on the older stuff but for the tracks on disc 3 and 4 to sound the way they do is a crime.  The box is only worth it to me for the hard to find tracks like JOIN TOGETHER and LONG LIVE ROCK and THE KIDS ARE ALLRIGHT.  Other wise save your money and by the remasters of WHO'S NEXT and LIVE AT LEEDS.
B000002BQK|4.0|I have always been an admirer of Ms. Carey's singles over the last decade without ever being driven to purchase any of her albums.  I purchased the album &quot;Butterfly&quot; on the strength of the &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;My All&quot; singles.  I just recently pulled this album off the shelf and gave it a spin after months and months of sitting dormant.  I have listened to it practically everyday since.  No one has accomplished the pop/r&amp;b/hip hop hybrid as successfully as Ms. Carey does with this release.  I particularly think the first half of the album is perfection.  There is not one misstep.  The visual imagery in the lyrics, the vocal arrangements and production are superior.  &quot;My All&quot; is quite simply a pop masterpiece.  Just a beautifully executed song.  The melodies leap and swirl and weave their way into your mind so much so that you find yourself humming and singing these songs throughout your day.  &quot;Whenever You Call&quot; is a stunning example of Ms. Carey's vocal prowess and &quot;The Roof&quot; and &quot;Fourth of July&quot; show her at her sexy, velvety best.  A very commendable effort that brought all of her strengths together for a winning formula that I feel is truly hers alone.  This record made me an official fan and I look forward to what lies ahead in her career.  Critics can be a bit heavy handed in their treatment of her, but there is absolutely no denying her talents in creating pop songs with beautiful melodies, universal sentiment and some of the best background vocal arrangements I have ever heard!  Give it a try.  It actually gets better with time.
B00003CXFU|5.0|I thought &quot;A Civil Action&quot; was a good movie...Erin Brockovich is 100% better! Julia Roberts plays a Dynamite Role...Shes got spunk, character, guts...and it's based on a true story...which makes it even more Dynamite...
B00004XOWM|4.0|I like this cd; it has cool songs on it. buy it.
0553106635|5.0|Martin's books are not ones you read and walk away from easily, and A Storm of Swords works its way into you even more than the previous two in the series.  &quot;Storm&quot; is an apt word...summer is over in the Seven Kingdoms and autumn has arrived with an unforgiving rain that drowns crops, bloats the many corpses, and leaves the characters searching for physical and emotional shelter.  Unfortunately for them, little of either is to be found.  Betrayals are expected, and as each person's defenders prove false one by one the feeling of desolation and loneliness is overpowering.<br />You can read this book and gasp at Martin's ability to twist and turn the plot against itself, to create an immersive world, to avoid predictability at all costs.  But when, an hour into another daily task, you suddenly feel inexplicable sadness and tears, you truly have experienced his gift: to create characters that live in you, and a mood that seeps into you as much as the rain does the gray, bloody mud.<br />Is there any reason not to buy this book?  The fact that the series is only half over would be my only one.  Waiting the years until it's completed is only part of the difficulty.  Finding something else half as good to read in the meantime is the hard part.
0312263511|3.0|Eugene Cernan's book offers us another look at the manned space flight programs of the 60' and 70's.  His primary focus in the book was on the Gemini flights with special emphasis on his near disastrous space-walk during the Gemini 9 flight.  Many, many pages were devoted to the details and trials of Apollo crew selection and training but the book skimped on actual flight information and aspects of his Apollo 17 moon mission.  The real details of the Apollo 17 mission are what I expected from this book but did not receive.  Cernan also was not squeamish at all about denigrating his fellow astronauts.  Got the feeling that there were quite a few axes left over from those days to grind.  Maybe so, but the cynical attitude toward his fellow heroes does not make a better book in my opinion.  On a sadder note, the book does attempt to address the issue of the disintegration of Cernan's 1st marriage.  Hopefully, Cernan now knows that marriage and family have to come first, even before a space career.    It is a real shame that seemingly highly successful people like the astronauts just do not seem to want to realize this simple fact.
B0000507UD|3.0|Well. Limp bizkit is going over the ledge. With each CD gettin more and more MainStream. Thats just to bad. With this CD they have gone over to R&amp;B which was not one of there parts on the 3$ album. Thats a shame, Cause the 3$ album in my oppinion was the best ever (so far). THis Album lacks all that the 3$ album had. but has gained some new stuff. It has no Heavy tune like Break stuff was on the Significant other album, and thats not good. IOf you like melodic R&amp;b his is an album for you. If you liked the 3$ album like me i suggest that you buy something else.
B00004XOWM|5.0|The first two Limp Bizkit cds were fantastick, but this new album truley exceeds any definition.  From the robotic interlude to the voice mail ending, this cd is amazing.  Combining rap and rock, the guys of Limp Bizkit have impressed me to no end.  This album is one of those albums that you can play over and over again and still never tire of it. The expectations that were held before the ablum's release were high, but Limp Bizkit definitly surpassed all of those expectations.  To the guys of Limp Bizkit, I say &quot;This is, by far, the best cd ever made&quot;.
0780631684|1.0|I'm sorry to say that I lost my time watching this movie ... This is one of the worst movie I saw in 2000 ... This is for the people that really enjoy movies like Scream or other poor scary movie ... Actors are great, but the movie itself is far from a classic ... Great FX but that's about it ... Hope we will have the chance to see a better movie before the end of the year ...
0783225792|2.0|It's not Goodfellas. It never had the potential to be Goodfellas. I've read the book and it was long arduous reading, just liek this film is long arduous viewing. Almost identicle team-up from Goodfellas simply makes you wonder if perhaps he was just looking for more praise and/or money. Cut it two hours and it might be tolerable. Note: I don't hate long movies just beacuse there long, I hate them if there long without content. I loved Magnolia and Gone With The Wind so don't even attempt to criticize.
B000000I0G|5.0|This is one of Mikes greatest ever albums, fantastic instrumentals and great songs combine into a stunning whole.  Taurus II is one of his best ever tracks, and Family Man and the title track are easily his best songs.  Get this Tubular Bells 2 and Discovery ahead of any other mike album.  You will be glad you did
B000002C1V|4.0|Everyone bashes this album, they shouldn't. This is one example of a Floyd album that due to it's lack of being pop-savy suffers heavily. Give it a while. Listen to it a couple of times before you judge. I personally have grown to love this album for it's poetic language and powerful messages. And if you think this is the worst you ought to lister to Gilmour's opus of crap &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;.
0679879269|5.0|I've waited nearly two years for this book and Phillup Pullman lives up to every expectation of the series with The Amber Spyglass.  His creativity and imagination are boundless and this book only reinforces that.  The variety of characters and scale of worlds he creates is breathtaking.  He will go down in history as one of the great authors of our time (at least I think he will ;)).  Get it!  (Not for devout Christians)
B000006TRV|5.0|Although I like it less than I used to it still stands as great proof of not only the musical talant of Floyd, but the depth of Waters, something missing from the Post-&quot;Final Cut&quot; Floyd. For beggining Floyd fans this and &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; are the two you must begin with. If you don't own it stop thinking and buy the damn thing. Note:The movie is not a companion piece and although in my opinion good not for the weak at heart.
B00004XONN|2.0|I wanted to like this album.  I really did.  Many people are saying how they have &quot;reinvented music&quot;.  That's a load of rubbish.  There are a few interesting odds and ends, but overall the album is just not very listenable.  Radiohead has made great music on their past albums and I think most people are grading this album on past accomplishments.  It's mostly pompous, overblown noise.  Don't believe the hype.
0790729725|5.0|I know what your thinking, what about &quot;The Godfather&quot;? Don't get me wrong I'm a fan. But it is impossible to deny it has flaws(e-mail me if you wanna have examples), which Goodfellas has none.  This was my favorite film of all time until I saw &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; and still remains un-chalanged in my number two slot. Scorsese uses his trademark scrolling and fast-paced movement to deliver an intensity that is delivered by none other. With an incredible cast of Ray Liota(who proves in this and Copland that he is the most under-rated actor today), Joe Pesci, and the always incredible godlike Robert DeNiro the already powerful script is risen to levels that astound and bewilder. The few complaints I've ever even heard of this film were simply of its violence, which if you've seen this know is completely necessary. Note:Just because you like this don't think you'll like Casino, it proves team-ups don't always bring repeat success.

B000002U82|5.0|This is easily my favorite album and no matter how much I listen to this it just gets better. The Wall was good but this is where it will always begin for those getting into Floyd. When you listen to this it's like hearing a higher power speak to you. I do believe in god; thy names tis Waters and Gilmour. If you don't own this album you will be punished when you die. The mix of synthesizers, mind-bending lyrics, and guitar work that could take on Clapton this album will always be number one. If you own this go listen to it, if you don't buy it!
0060976624|4.0|Christopher Buckley's Thank You for Not Smoking is a hilarious political satire that will leave readers hacking with laughter.  As the chief spokesman of the Academy of Tobacco Studies, readers are suppose to despise the arrogant, yuppie slimeball, Nick Naylor and what he stands for.  Amazingly, Nick loves his job and happily promotes and defends the right of smokers daily.  However, the trials and tribulations he goes through to pay the mortgage and put his son through the prestigious private school, St. Euthanasius, has readers sympathizing, and even liking him.  Unfortunately, Nick's boss, BR, (Budd Rohrabacher) wants Nick ousted of his PR position so Jeannette Dantine, BR's bedroom buddy, can take his place.  He seeks comfort with the M.O.D. (Merchants of Death) squad consisting of two other friends employed by the NRA and alcohol industry.  The group meets for lunch to complain about their bosses and debate which one works for the worse industry.  In attempts to save his career, Nick has over the weekend to create a phenomenal campaign scheme that will revolutionize the tobacco industry.  Although BR tries to undermine his ideas, Nick manages to sustain his job, and even up his salary.  As he successfully climbs upwards on the career ladder his fame is heightened by his triumphant Oprah and Larry King Live stints.  Everything seems to be in tact with Nick; even his sex life seems to be at a climax as he juggles two women at once.   However, Nick's popularity seems to be escalating too rapidly when a group of anti-tobacco terrorists kidnap him and nearly kill him by covering his body with lethal nicotine patches.  But Nick doesn't let this stop him.  Instead, he uses his near-death experience to promote the smoking industry and condemn nicotine patches.  Before he knows it, Nick finds himself bombarded by bodyguards and on the search for his attempted killers.  Nick's relentlessness to win and be the best in the industry sets the stage for comic relief.  He is sly, conniving, and has no morals.  Yet, his persistent, driven character has readers rooting him on.  It offers insight as to what insane, slimy, disgusting things people will actually do to get to the top.  If you like scandals, behind the scene dramas, and pure comedy this best seller is a must read.  It will leave you wanting more.
0790749815|5.0|Action and suspense are the two words that could never be described better than by the title &quot;North by Northwest&quot;. Cary Grant(who had worked previously with Hitchcock in Suspicion,Notorious,and To Catch A Thief) heads off a cross counrty thriller that is not only exciting but witty and over-all well directed. Right up there with the other Hitchcock masterpieces and probably the best, next to Vertigo, this a must see.
0399146253|1.0|Patricia Cornwell's earlier works are simply her best. That is  how I got hooked. I eagerly awaited this one only to be bored with it from the start. She really needs to regroup and backup and write as I know she can. Too much Lucy and not enough ME stuff.I wanted so much to like this one and I was very disappointed.
B000002A3T|4.0|Far,far,far,far,far better than &quot;A Momentary Lapse Of Reason&quot;. This is a good mixture of traditional Pink Floyd power with pop-savy twists. Cluster One is the best Gilmour tune since Numb and is a heck of an ending to the album. You can't help but like this even if your a Waters fan like myself.
0679879269|5.0|I have enthralled many a reader in my classroom with Phillip Pullman's brilliant novels.  For the last three years, I have created a core group of students waiting for &quot;the third book.&quot;  I read it myself in two evenings and relished every minute.  Alas, my students will  not see it, nor can I suggest their parents buy it for them.  Philisophically, Pullman went too far for the impressionable young reader.  Hopefully when they're in high school they'll remember to look it up.  Thanks for the ride, Mr. Pullman.  I only wish the kids could have come along.  Enthralled and disappointed...<br /> school,
B000002U8G|4.0|I noticed in a previous review someone stated this goes insync with Fantasia. Cool. Well before I give my review I must say in addition to that Echoes the final track goes insync with the Jupiter the final part of the movie 2001:A Space Odyssey. Down to bussiness. This album is a pink floyd great, anyone who has the aquired pre-dark side taste will agree this is one of the best. From One Of These Days-The Hyonotic epic Echoes(the greatest Floyd epic next to Dogs) this is one astonishing album. I also believe this to be the bridge between the psychedelic Floyd and the Floyd that would soon release Dark Side Of The Moon. You must hear this album if you want to get a little deeper into Pink Floyd's world.
B000002UAR|5.0|Of all the Beatles' albums, Revolver has probably aged best. 'Yellow Submarine' is a dud, pure and simple, but this set makes up the band's greatest achievement. Capitol's exploitative policy of subtracting a few tracks from one Beatles album to whack onto the next was never more despicable. <br />'Taxman' kicks off the set admirably, although Harrison's lament jars a bit - I mean, why is he complaining about paying his fair share of tax, anyway? Is this the same bloke who wrote 'Living in the Material World'? Still, this track, along with his other contributions (4 &amp; 10),  demonstrate how far Harrison had come as a songwriter. <br />Lennon and McCartney were at their top here. Macca's ballads (2,5 ,10), helped along by some fine Martin arrangements, are probably the best he ever wrote, stopping this side of schmalzy, while Lennon's major contributions (3, 7, 14) are quite brilliant. (Although it's probably the soundscape of 'Tomorrow Never Knows', mainly courtesy of spooky tape loops and a huge drum sound, that makes it such a standout.)<br />'And Your Bird Can Sing' and 'Doctor Robert' are often described as weak tracks, but I can't find too much wrong with them. If nothing else, the former boasts fine harmonised lead guitar parts.<br />The sounds which the Fabs, producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick were able to coax from ageing studio hardware are remarkable. Macca's close-miked bass is right up there in the mix, clear as a bell, Ringo's drums sound terrific even today, and there are interesting guitar sounds everywhere. As well, Revolver extended the experiment with backwards parts which had begun on 'Rain', and is used to great effect here. The musicianship, particularly McCartney's bass playing, is great throughout. Honourable mention to R. Starkey for 'She Said She Said'.<br />Bookended by two magnificent double-A side 45s ('Rain'/'Paperback Writer'; 'Strawberry Fields Forever'/'Penny Lane'), this album is demonstrably the Beatles' creative peak, and you can see why Brian Wilson was inspired to go one better with Pet Sounds. Essential.

B0000025D0|3.0|Thoroughly more soul-infused and much darker than his earlier work with the E Street Band, &quot;Darkness...&quot; is still somewhat of an enigma in it's eclectic collection of hope and despair all in the same place.<br />The album segues in and out of varying moods, from the hopeful bang of &quot;Badlands&quot; directly to the hard-rocking, gritty &quot;Adam Raised a Cain.&quot; <br />But it's the more soulful songs that caught my attention. Ballads like &quot;Something in the Night,&quot; the hot-rod-inspired &quot;Racing in the Streets,&quot; and the organ-driven &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; are the emotional centerpieces of the album, which focuses on aspirations more than anything.<br />The uptempo songs on this album actually slowed it down a little, for me, anyway. While I did like &quot;The Promised Land,&quot; &quot;Candy's Room&quot; was too busy, and &quot;Factory&quot; was a little non-descript, but then, I can't identify with the elements in it. I'm sure it's a lot of fans' favorite song.<br />Overall, this is a good Springsteen album, but if you're just getting started listening to him, start somewhere else and work your way here.

B000002513|5.0|I can't pretend that I was around when this album came out. I'm only 19, so I can't talk about the impact that it had. But I can say that THIS is one HELL of an album.<br />From the discordant sounds of the E Street horns warming up, you can tell that this is gonna be a fun album. And that it is. This album is enjoyable to listen to from beginning to end. From the carefree guitars in &quot;E Street Shuffle&quot; to the mood-setting bongos of &quot;New York City Serenade,&quot; Springsteen's second album is a clear winner.<br />There honestly isn't one song on the album I don't like. From the quiet longing in &quot;4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)&quot; to the raucous &quot;Kitty's Back&quot; to the tuba-driven &quot;Wild Bill's Circus Story,&quot; it's all good music and great lyrics.<br />But the back half of the album has to be my favorite. I love the streetwise city tale on &quot;Incident on 57th Street,&quot; which segues into the marathon-rocker &quot;Rosalita.&quot; Punctuated by a great chorus (&quot;Rosalita, jump a little lighter/Senorita, come sit by my fire/I just wanna be your lover, ain't no liar/Rosalita, you're my sole desire&quot;) and a really bouncy arrangement, if this song doesn't get you up and jumping, check for a pulse.<br />The final opus, however, is my personal favorite of Springsteen's songs. The slow-paced, piano/bongo/acoustic &quot;New York City Serenade&quot; is pure musical beauty. Springsteen's crooning ballad about love, the city and other topics has the power to just put you in a trance and keep you there 'til the end.<br />Be advised: this album will HOOK you on Springsteen. But it's well worth the addiction!
B0000507PC|5.0|Set in an a surprisingly humane orphanage in Maine in the early 1940's, the good doctor who runs it, Michael Caine, delivers babies and also performs abortions, assisted by one of the two dozen orphans, played by tobey Maguire, now grown to manhood.<br />Later, the young man leaves the protectiveness  of the orphanage to work in an apple orchard, picking apples with a group of African American apple pickers and learning about the rules that hang on the wall of the cider house.<br />The acting is superb and the story is deep on many levels, dealing the some tough questions of right and wrong.<br />Also, this is the first film I ever saw about an orphanage where the children were not mistreated.  I found this refreshing and a new and interesting reality.<br />Some might find this video too moody and sentimental.  I didn't.  Highly recommended.
B00000255F|4.0|Everyone in the entire universe is familiar with &quot;Born to Run,&quot; so I really don't think I need to belabor over how great the rebel anthem is. Let me get on to the rest of the album, which is just as good, if not better.<br />It's Springsteen's Everyman lyrics and quality that has made him such an enduring rock icon. People can identify with him and the songs he sings. There's something personal at stake in every word, and his fans can sense that. And while &quot;Born to Run&quot; isn't as personal as some of his other works, it's well worth the price.<br />The tracks are pretty much all very well-done. &quot;Thunder Road&quot; builds from a simple melody to an epic ending in a few short minutes, and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; is New Jersey funk, if there is such a thing (?!).<br />There is, in my opinion, a little filler (which there shouldn't be much room for on an 8-song album, but hey), which comes in the form of &quot;Night.&quot; My personal thought is that it's a little bland. &quot;She's the One,&quot; while it does bump and roll along, gets old fast, as well.<br />But the last two are my favorites. The piano-and-horn beauty of &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; tell the tale of small-time hoods along with a little comic relief (&quot;Here, stuff this in your pocket/It'll look like you're carryin' a friend...&quot;), all over a musical backdrop to die for. Then comes the epic, mini-rock-opera, &quot;Jungleland.&quot; Painting Anytown, USA almost perfectly, Springsteen and Company take the listener on a musical journey through the night, highlighted by fantastic lyrics (&quot;The poets down here don't write nothing at all/They just stand back and let it all be&quot;) and wonderful guitar work. The shifting tempos and majesty of the song make it truly something to behold.<br />This is a great Springsteen album. Not the best, but CERtainly well deserving to be in your collection.
B000002ULO|4.0|And this is absolutely my opinion...is the booklet that comes with the CD. Not only does it give the usual liner notes of who played on what and where, but also personal notes from Paul on and about each of the songs here. That made it more of a listening pleasure for me, even though, once again in my opinion, there are a few clunkers here.<br />Fresh from the Beatles &quot;Anthology&quot; project, it's just Paul &amp; Jeff Lynne, mostly (though not over-produced, as Lynne has done in the past) with contributions from Steve Miller, McCartney's son, James, Ringo Starr, George Martin and, of course, his lovely Linda.<br />The &quot;best's&quot; for me here are:<br />&quot;The Song That We Were Singing&quot; &quot;Young Boy&quot; &quot;Calico Skies&quot; &quot;Flaming Pie&quot;  &quot;Souvenir&quot; &quot;Little Willow&quot; &quot;Beautiful Night&quot;  <br />Not my favorite McCartney CD, but still one of his best.
0679731725|5.0|Not often would you find the protagonist of a novel bereft of emotions and sentiments. Stevens, the narrator-hero of the `The Remains of the Day' is one such rarity.<br /> In the novel, Stevens, the archetypal butler, recounts his experiences in an aristocratic household in the post-war England, as he travels to meet a long separated female colleague. The aftermath of the war has rattled his cloistered and complacent life and he never reconciles to the fact that the distinguished household should ever pass on to the hands of a strange American.<br /> This American master has given Stevens the keys of his Ford and has sent him out to explore the world. Once out of the claustrophobic atmosphere of Darlington Hall, Stevens discovers a totally different world: beautiful, expansive, informal, accommodating and full of zest.<br /> Towards the end of the journey he is found reflecting, `I should cease looking back so much, ... I should adopt a more positive outlook and try to make the best of what remains of my day.'<br /> Characterization and language contribute greatly to the enduring quality of the novel. Stevens is a very complex, self-effacing and inhibited character who likes to `minimize my presence by standing in the shadows.' He takes refuge in a highly regulated and formal lifestyle, where all human emotions are set aside. His mindless loyalty to and blind faith in his employer (`I have every trust in his lordship's good judgment.') look odd in the light of the fact that the master is a strong sympathizer of Nazi Germany and hater of Jews.<br /> The language is tuned perfectly to the needs of the narrative -- sometimes subdued, sometimes formal or stiff-upper-lippish, but always a pleasure to read.<br /> The novel derives its greatest strength from a big irony around which it is built: Stevens making all the fuss of himself and his master, without knowing what kind of a fool he is.<br /> A  well-deserved winner of the Booker Prize.

Black and white is absolutly gorgoues in this movie.  woe be it to anyone who wishes it were in color.        <br />  anyways this movie is so great.   the battles are very realistic instead of a free for all. its paced . very very different from todays movies
0553266306|5.0|I loved this book.  I read it many years ago and then re-read it more recently.  Frederick Forsyth is a master.  He portrays such interesting characters is such a sublime, eloquent manner.  He builds suspense bit by bit in an incredibly analytical and seamless manner.<br />Not only is the suspense so well developed, but so are the characters.  You really get inside of their lives, especially the police inspector who methodically hunts down the assassin.<br />His main character, Le Chacal, the assassin, is so controlled and so smooth.  The assassin is a master of disguise and evasion, and perhaps the coldest man on earth.  He is willing and able to kill to fulfill his mission - the assassination of Charles de Gaulle.<br />Yes, Frederick Forsyth is a master.  A master storyteller and a master suspense builder.  This is a superbly well-written novel that will draw you in, making you read until the wee hours of the evening, or morning.
0790751305|5.0|I've just finished seeing the film so many had urged me to over the years,and I can tell you this: it was worth it.<br />  In the recent years I've caught a glimpse of the nature of the movie here and there, and the main phrase that repeated itself was this movie is &quot; a requiem to the west&quot;. I can say that I completely accept this notion ,for once I see it eye to eye with all those critics.<br />  It seems like a realistic movie, giving the feeling that things could've been the way they're presented. I feel like nobody's trying to fool me ,to sell me another fantasy about how heroic the life of men and women were back then .Instead ,I'm given something different than before, a new perspective from another angel of the events ,difficulties and problems people had to deal with in this life style.<br />  I admired the way the prostitudes were shown, not as objects ,but as human beings, though NOT in the eyes of most of the characters. I admired the character of Eastwood as the sphinkx who regained his old outstanding abilities as a gunman,and did what he had to do at the purifying endind scene.<br />  &quot;Unforgiven&quot; is not intended for one deed ,but for two. and that's ,too,TWO good reasons to watch this film .
630179513X|3.0|After an exhausting second installment in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy, &quot;Part III&quot; quickly changes pace and reveals itself to be a charming and exciting end to the time travel series.  The film begins right after the events in the second film which found Marty and Doc Brown travelling from the future, to a sinister 1985, to the wholesome 1955 to save the space time continuum.  Even with this fun and fast paced adventure, &quot;Part II&quot; was essentially a downer.  &quot;Part III&quot; lightens things up considerably.<br />Marty is now stranded (again!) in 1955, and his friend Doc Brown has been stranded in 1885.  Disregarding Doc's warning about any more tampering with the space time continuum, Marty risks yet another time travel trip only this time to 1885 to rescue his friend Doc Brown.<br />The story arc here is almost identical to the first film in that Marty is stranded again, is trying to get home and devises a thrillingly complicated action sequence to get back to 1985.  As the story centers on only one era; the old west, the film has a great deal of fun focusing on eccentric cowboys, gunfights and train wrecks.<br />Also in the spirit of the first film, there is a sweet romance only this time it's with the most unlikely &quot;BTTF&quot; character, Doc Brown himself.  Doc falls in love with a charming school teacher and is torn as he ponders whether he should stay in the old west with is true love or go back to the future.  In the first and even second film, Doc spent a great deal of time telling Marty he shouldn't take chances.  This time it's Marty telling Doc to grow up and make smart decisions but Doc can't help himself because he's in love.  It's a charming development.   &quot;Part III&quot; is funny, sweet and has none of the negative traits of the disappointing &quot;Part II&quot;.  While not as great as the first classic film, &quot;Part III&quot; delivers a grand entertainment full of good cheer and warmth.  It is a wonderful ending to the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy.
0060976624|5.0|Oh, those evil tobacco companies.  This is a wonderful job of portraying both sides of the tobacco industry.  Whatever your feelings are on the subject, Christopher Buckley writes a beautiful novel about the struggle between big tobacco, anti-tobacco lobbyists and the government.  While doing so, he also succeeds at portraying a middle-aged divorced father perfectly and keeps the story entertaining.<br />Nick Naylor is a tobacco lobbyist that is also a devoted smoker. He struggles to fight off anti-tobacco lobbysists while trying to keep his sanity at the same time.  Buckley does a brilliant job of creating this character.  If the reader is strongly against tobacco, they can still feel a bit of compassion for the man.  In his own words, he only promotes the portrayed &quot;industry of death&quot; to &quot;pay the mortgage.&quot;  Buckley also nicely exposes a side of the anti-tobacco lobby that may not be realized.  <br />All in all, &quot;Thank You For Smoking&quot; is a great book.  It is one that is very hard to put down, even if you don't agree with the side of the story that is being portrayed.  Sex, alcohol, smokes, they're all in here.  They blend together to create a brilliant story that should be required reading for any person lobbying for or against an issue.
B000009EAD|5.0|this album is really cool.......... some songs are heavy and some are slow and that is what is cool about Iced Earth.  alot of people would say Iced earth and Nevermore sounds the same.......... well a bit, Nevermore sounds like Iron Maiden but in a progressive style and Iced Earth sounds alot like Judas Priest.  Matthew Barlow (the singer) is just awsome, I never heard such good singing and just to let you know that my dad got really hooked up to this cd and his favorite songs from this album is track number 4 and 6.......... mine is track number 9 (1776). you should really get this album because these guys worked really hard for it and they have some great songs (except track number 3 and 11). GET IT NOW!!
B000002J1O|5.0|The best Prog/band of all time. I'm 42 and a fan of almost every kind of music. My first two albums (you remember vinyl don't you?) were Selling England and Floyd's wish you were here. This album not only brings back memories of a special time of my life, it reminds me of a time of great music. In a time when music is driven by beer companies and shoes and a bands first priority is to become millionaires on a single hit, its refreshing to know a time existed when music was made from a more creative intellectual force. The music on this CD is beautiful and timeless. It would be great to see them one more time for us old timers.... You teased use with Carpet 99....
6305657947|4.0|I thought this movie was full of action but also had a logic plot: something almost unheard of in action movies, especially when you compare it to movies like MI-2.  The actors were right for the part and the whole product was incredibly entertaining. It is a movie worth watching.  I have watched it myself 3 times.
0201508036|5.0|After 9 years as a researcher in image analysis and pattern recognition, I still refer to this book on a regular basis.  It give straightforward explainations of a broad range of algorithms.  If I ever forget how to do something, I know I can look here and be reminded.
630562285X|2.0|Ok, so this movie is mildly entertaining.  After all, Zeta-Jones' body clad in skin-tight garments is certainly a sight worth beholding.  However, that's pretty much all this movie can sport: the story is weak and not very original (the &quot;Thomas Crown affair&quot; is the real thing and a much better movie overall) and the characters are not convinced about their roles (neither are we).  It is not the worst movie I've ever seen but it could be better.  Go for the other title (The &quot;TC affair&quot;) if you haven't seen it already and enjoy!
0679879269|5.0|In a stunning conclusion to Philip Pullman's His Dark Material's Trilogy, he sets himself up for what could have been the hardest writing task faced by any author _ever_, but he manages to pull off concluding a trilogy that equals or excels works by LeGuin, Tolkien, and Lewis. In short, this book ends what my be one of the greatest stories ever concieved by mankind, and it does so very well.<br />When I finished the second book, I thought to myself &quot;Aye, Pullman's going to be in a bit of hot water with radical Christian groups ranting about his themes of the death of God (or lack thereof) and whatnot.&quot; As you can see in some of the Amazon reviews, we have some people who loved the book but their religious devotion was the only reason to pull down their rating. It's JUST A BOOK, people. Don't you know how and why religion came about in this world!? It was a way for our primitive minds to grasp the world around us. It governs our thoughts and our actions, and often times, religious zealots will blindly follow their beliefs without questioning them. This does not mean that I hate all religions. I _do_ hate people who denounce books and movies and culture as &quot;works of Satan himself.&quot; and protest the release of such materials with relish. These nutcases need to remove the neurosis from their lives and get on with it. So what if a book presents a viewpoint that is different than yours? Don't let that EVER cloud your judgement of the author, the plot, the imagination, and the magic of literature.<br />That being said, I will say that this book isn't perfect. Scenes regarding Father Gomez feel short-shifted and out of place. Some scenes feel unnecessary and weigh down the already long book. But besides that, this book is very good. Imagery through words is so vivid and detailed that the reader feels that he or she is actually part of the book. Pullman does well to create characters that aren't the perfect superhuman types. Deciet and lies are very prominant as character traits throughout the book. <br />The Amber Spyglass effectively ties together the entire series and ends it strongly and well. His Dark Materials deserves the highest praise and should be put with the likes of the Earthsea Series and Lord of the Rings.<br />-Freddie W
0060976624|5.0|Christopher  Buckley has struck gold with Thank You for Smoking.  Not since the 1997 blockbuster hit Alien Resurreciton, have I been made to sympathize with such an abominable character.  Just as Jean-Pierre Jeunet made us sympathize with  the mutant ali-human children of  the Ellen Ripley clone, Buckley made me love the nasty, carcenogenic Nick Naylor. The connection between director Jeunet and author Buckley is the ability to make readers and viewers sympathize with immanent death.        Only a truly talented individual could make a human sympathize with the natural element against which evolution has fought.  Buckley has done just this.  Nick Naylor, knowing that smoking in hazardous to human health,  spends his career convincing the American public otherwise.  He impregnates an entire nation's chest with certain death.  But Buckley manages to make us love Nick, who is doing nothing more than persuing the American Dream by any means necessary.
6303421563|5.0|The Professional, known in Europe as &quot;Leon&quot;.<br />Leon tells the story of a professional hit-man who, against his better judgement, saves the life of a twelve year old girl whose family have all been killed, and then he has to figure out what to do with her.  While this film has plenty of action, it's a lot more than just a shoot `em up type film - the main focus being on the relationship between Leon and the little girl, Matilda.<br />Leon is an Italian hit-man who works on a freelance basis for a mafia figure.  However, neither Leon nor the mafia man are your usual Godfather types, instead they seem thoughtful, considerate and even gentle!  OK, they kill people for a living, but otherwise they seem quite nice.  Leon, especially, is a quiet, pensive, doesn't take offence easily (there's none of that phoney \\"respect\\" stuff going on).  Leon does his job, keeps to the rules (no women, no kids), and keeps himself to himself.<br />Everything changes when a drugs deal in the apartment next to him goes wrong, and the family are all killed by a corrupt DEA officer, except for Matilda, who was on an errand for Leon, whom she had just befriended.  As she returns, she sees the mayhem in her apartment, and just walks right past and goes to Leon's door, as if it were her own.  After a long consideration, Leon answers, and so she is now with him.  <br />The main part of the film focuses on how they get on together, his life of order and predictability now gone, while she draws on his strength and stability, a strong father figure she never had.  She wants to learn the art of assassination so she can get the cop who killed her family, and Leon teaches her.  I can't describe too much more without giving the story away, but suffice to say there are plenty of moving scenes, and not a little shooting.<br />The performances are superb, with Natalie Portman in her debut absolutely stealing the show as the sweet and precocious little girl who steals Leon's heart.  Jean Reno, in his first really big Hollywood role, is just right as the gravely voiced strong silent type, while Gary Oldman is very convincing as the manic bad cop who will stop at nothing (really, nothing!) to get Leon.  Everything about this film is good, the music, the dialogue, the cinematography, and especially the performances.  There are some lovely touches, such as Leon's love for milk and his plant, and the scene where Leon and Matilda play a game where they dress up as famous characters and the other has to guess who they are.<br />By the end, you're shouting and cheering for Leon, and booing and hissing at Oldman.  Overall, this is a very engaging and poignant film, the kind you would watch again and again, and see more detail and nuances every time.  In my opinion, a must see.
B000002AH1|5.0|There was a certain style of extended riffing that became known as &quot;fusion&quot; ... other artists such as the original Soft Machine were able to fuse rock and jazz in entirely different ways ... Miles and his band did it in an entirely different way from anyone else on this release.<br />The bulk of this album (85 minutes or so) was recorded at the Cellar Door in D.C., in late 1970.  The band is tight.  Jack deJohnette is kicking up dust in all directions, Keith Jarrett is at his most pointed and soulful, and guest star John McLaughlin is playing the type of brilliant solos that Miles was presumably hoping for.<br />&quot;Sivad&quot; is a killer groove piece, but &quot;What I Say&quot; is even more impressive.  It's 20+ minutes of rolling groove placed on top of a highly aggressive beat.  It's timeless energy music and Miles does some of his best soloing on top of it.  Sides 3 and 4 are more deliberately formless, they're big rolling jams that don't go anywhere in particular.  But Side 1 and 2 make this must-have.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Who thought that they would put out an album that rivals all of their previous releases? I did. My boyfriend and I were not disappointed. The hard hitting &quot;Getcha                      Groove On&quot; is probably their best song ever, not to mention the split personality song &quot;Rollin'&quot;. All around great album to just sit back and chill                      to. Although you might be tempted to get out of your seat and jump around
0393314804|5.0|This is the story of Scottish heroin junkies and their friends.  Drugs, HIV/AIDS, drugs, sex, drugs, welfare, drugs and more healthy fun is what you'll find in this exquisite novel.<br />Trainspotting is often compared to A Clockwork Orange...  For one thing, they both write in slang (it takes a while to pick up but after a wee bit you'll find yessel typing the same wae, likesay...  daft draftpaks) and are both very explicit.   Still, they are different.  Trainspotting is a little more &quot;real,&quot; dealing with the present, while ACO warns us of the future.  Trainspotting revolves around a group of characters while ACO is about one protagonist (who is actually an antagonist too, if you're keeping score).  In any event, it's safe to say that if you liked one, you'll like the other.  <br />For people who are familiar with the movie but not the book: A few years after I saw the movie for the first time, I decided to read the book...  And I must say, the book is much better.  If you enjoyed the movie, you will LOVE this.  Granted, the book is harder to follow.  It's written from different points of view (not just Renton's), and thus includes many scenes/characters not in the film.  Don't say &quot;I saw the film, let's move on to something else...&quot;  READ THE BOOK!
B000001EMW|4.0|I just can't help but crack a smile when a cello breaks into the main vocal parts, like in Sandman, but the rhythym and solos are very impressive.  Parts of Metallica songs, like the slow part in Master of Puppets seem as though they were made for the cello, and it is beautiful.  If you can just get around the funny part that where James is supposed to be singing, there's a cello.  They did miss the big solo on Master of Puppets, but I imagine it would be next to impossible to do that much on an instrument with no frets.  My next purchase is going to be the Inquisition Symphony, which is supposed to be better than 4 Cellos since their success with the first one has lent itself to a greater degree of freedom to exercise their expertise in cello and make the piece almost seem as their own.  Plus, their original efforts, according to other reviews, are almost better than the Metallica songs themselves.
B00004XONN|5.0|wow. that's all that can be said. in no way is this the &quot;typical&quot; radiohead- but honestly, what is? with each album, they take drastic musiacl leaps...this has to be the biggest though. musically, this is their most artistic and abstract album. it's much more electronicaly-experimental, and the lyrics are more contemplative. the tracks aren't immediately catchy, but are incredibly so after many listens, (as i have found out). my favorites are; KID A, THE NATIONAL ANTHEM, HOW TO DISSAPEAR COMPLETELY, OPTIMISTIC, IN LIMBO, IDIOTEQUE, and MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK. i certainly would rate this above PABLO HONEY, and even THE BENDS, but to compare it to a masterpiece like OK COMPUTER is simply not fair because of how different in approach, they both are. but this certainly can stand up to it, and it is better in many ways. 2, or 3 of the tracks are almost &quot;classic radiohead&quot;, but the rest is pure drastic change. change (with radiohead) though is always good, and this album proves it. please buy this album if you have ANY interest in expanding your music-tastes, or if you are a RADIOHEAD fan. and RADIOHEAD, please keep pleasantly suprising us!
6305949638|5.0|...so is American Beauty, The Ice Storm, and many, many others. But &quot;The Cider House Rules&quot; is simply one films I would make if I had the experience. Beautiful cinematography, amazing score, perfectly cast, great locations, and a simple, yet sometimes complex story to base it upon.<br />Every shot of the film is breathtakingly beautiful. The camera slides with simplicity and perfection, and the picture is colorful and crystal clear.<br />The story is nicely put, and the film's two hours reel by silently and quickly. Tobey Maguire, who was in one of the most amazingly moving movie experiences, The Ice Storm, is back again(after other great films like The Wonder Boys and Pleasantville).<br />He is Homer Wells, son of parents who have no need to take care of him whatsoever, and lend him to a orphanage where Dr. Wilbur Larch (Michael Caine) takes over. Dr. Larch must be pretty special -- he has had several Wilburs' running about in his orphanage(named by him, of course).<br />Young Homer Wells grows up in the orphanage, and learns a great deal of hospital education through the usual pregencies and illegal abortions preformed at the orphanage.<br />Having spent his entire childhood and up to his teenage years in a baby-giving orphanage, he decides to see some of the world. He must of been really lucky, because of all that he sees is completely beautiful and wonderous. He then goes into an apple farm and meets some nice people there too.<br />Since this movie is mainly about him, the film also has an open ending to which the main character(Homer Wells) is based upon.<br />The film provokes so many good emotions, particularly when Homer returns to the orphanage. It's the best feel-good movie of 1999.
B000000WFU|5.0|Imagine a wild, windswept night with clouds racing accross the sky and the sea crashing on rocks below.A yacht battles the storm, knowing safety is close at home. Close your eyes, and forget all that the modern world brings. Just be open to the raw sound of the powers of nature...... This album may not suit all, but I challenge anyone with a soul to listen to Track 5, In Caelum Fero, and not feel moved in one way or another.Uplifting is hardly a fit description. If you think you've heard all from the many ads which this music has graced, think again. It's one of the few CDs I've just left on repeat for hours - even better if you're playing it somewhere of special meaning to you, and at full volume. The unique, clever, challenging vocal patterns and underlying key changes bring to this music something which even many classical &quot;greats&quot; lack - pure emotion, in all its forms. The composers, on the sleeve notes, describe Sanctuary as not only a religious place, but somewhere to loose yourself. Whatever trials or problems you face seem to fade away when reminded that there is a way to bring peace, though the music is not always peaceful. The orchestration is superb, and the amazing vocals of Miriam Stockley are not quickly forgotten. So listen, enjoy, and head back to that clifftop, tasting the spray, watching the stars hide behind scurrying clouds, and remember that in all the world's man made problems, nature has the last word.....
0792842731|4.0|This film had some nice touches and some BRILLIANT chase scenes (there were definitely not enough of those in Goldeneye) and a really, really horrible villain.  With Renard in The World Is Not Enough, you could feel almost sorry for him, and with 006 in Goldeneye you could see where he was coming from, but this Carver guy is just horrible, slimy and sneaky.  I thought it was a bit obvious at the end when Bond and Wai Lin went off together, that didn't need to happen and could've been left out.  Still, it's not bad, and it's better than a piece of wet fish.  Right?
6302732875|5.0|I first picked up this video on a whim at my local video store about a year ago. I had no expectations, but the store was closing and I just decided to grab SOMETHING. Very lucky for me. This quickly became one of my favorite films; the dialogue is dense and powerful, the performances are hard-hitting and compelling. This ensemble gels and turns a fine script into gold; if you are a fan of any of these actors, you owe it to yourself to buy this film.
0792842723|4.0|I thought Brosnan did very well considering this was his first Bond movie - indeed all the actors were very convincing.  The trouble was though that about 3/4 of the way through this film I got bored.  It was just too predictable - fight, fight, kill bad girl, fight, fight, kill bad guy.  Up until they got to Cuba I was really enjoying it, but afterwards it just got a bit dull.  However the bit with Boris clicking the pen was really clever and tense, and I liked the bit when Bond went to see that gangster guy in Russia.  Not a bad film, but The World Is Not Enough was better.
B0000024TQ|5.0|This album is one of Simon &amp; Garfunkel's best, I would list as an I Love It album but I think I'm just going to wait and list the collection, Old Friends which has all their best works. It is a simply fantastic collection of songs, by some extremely talented lyricists and songwriters. Many consider Bridge Over Troubled Water to be their best album, I think a very good argument could be made for this album as well, though I think I would have to go with Bridge eventually just because there are more great songs on that album.<br />I've been listening to S&amp;G for quite awhile, I was a big fan in High School and I recently decided to go back and get quite a few of their albums because I really missed them. This was one of the first albums I got. The songs on here are very compelling and are a completely different type of folk rock than most of what you see. I feel drawn in every time by S&amp;G's storytelling ability and there ability to weave a lyrical narrative that surrounds you and beckons you closer.<br />There are so many great tracks on this album that it's tempting to go through each one, however let me just start by pointing out my favorites. &quot;America&quot; is a great song and could very well be my favorite S&amp;G song though I think it would have to fight &quot;The Boxer&quot; for that spot. This is a song about some lonely teenagers travelling across America and experiencing all sorts of interesting events that allow them to grow in their appreciation of life in general.<br />The combination of &quot;Voices of Old People&quot; and &quot;Old Friends&quot; is a great piece of blending in spoken conversation to a very natural song. &quot;Voices&quot; is a set of recordings made by Paul and Art of actual conversations that they overheard. This piece is extremely well done and very natural. It blends in to &quot;Old Friends&quot; which is a great song about what true friendship really means and is very poetic.<br />&quot;Save The Life of My Child&quot; is a very energetic song that discusses suicide, and contains an urgent plea to try and preserve young lives as much as possible. The chorus in the background is extremely haunting in its nature. &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot; is of course the song that so many people remember from The Graduate and is still a great song. &quot;Hazy Shade of Winter&quot; is almost better know from the remake made by The Bangles in the 80's but this is still a stupendous song.<br />There are two other songs I must mention on this album. &quot;At The Zoo&quot; and &quot;Punky's Dilemma&quot; are both told with an almost whimsical attitude and really show that besides all the serious subjects that S&amp;G talk about they also know how to have fun. I sometimes skip these songs though simply because they are so tongue-in-cheek.<br />This is a great album and I highly recommend it to everyone. However if you are just starting to listen to S&amp;G and want one album, you might want to check out Greatest Hits or Bridge Over Troubled Water. Also if you really like S&amp;G, I would recommend that you check out some of Dylan's earlier work like John Wesley Harding and Desire both of these albums remind me of S&amp;G and vice versa.

0060976624|4.0|While I was apprehensive upon being assigned a bit of \\"witty\\" modern literature in my class, I do not regret for a moment being forced to read this book.  I like to read just about anything, but this book was better than most.  It starts with an utterly disgusting character as a very believable protagonist, and the contradictions escalate from there.  <br />This book is truly witty, but in a way that is different than you'd expect.  Yes, it has a good deal of humor, but it is the complete reversal of common sensibilities that is so impressive.  I had to check myself every so often and remind myself that the guy I was cheering for was spending all of his efforts trying to put cancer sticks in the mouths of pre-teens.  A real winner.<br />But that is the kicker - this guy is amazing.  Buckley has created a character in Nick Naylor who is ingeniously evil, and yet the reader can't help pulling for him the whole way.  He's in the middle of a political lobby that is exactly what we, as humans, should object to, but I just couldn't while I was reading.  <br />This book is gripping.  From the first lie, through the abduction and dispensing of justice towards mister Naylor, right up until the end, the pages turn themselves.  Buckley makes it all okay with his ending, and Nick turns out to be a good guy after all who pays his debt to society and then makes money off of the whole ordeal.  <br />Buy this book.  It's cheap, it's fun, it won't take but a cool minute to read.  Plus, it's really good.  And, if you're lucky, you can get college credit for it.
0060976624|5.0|Thank You For Smoking is a wildly original, hilarious book.  In challenging the mainstream political correctness of America it opens the reader's eyes to a different perspective.  Nick Naylor is a supremely intriguing character who is such a pure representation of greed that it is impossible not to like him.  The spins he puts on attacks from anti-smoking groups or witty and shrewd and very well-done.  Christopher Buckley does a great job of keeping the reader constantly engaged in the action with a developing plot filled with several unexpected twists and turns.  Though a work of fiction, the book feels so realn that the reader assumes they are learning about ATS, a real tobacco lobby. You would swear buckley is the head of P.R. himself.                                                          The book succeeds most in its many subplot which support the main theme of Naylor fighting the anti-smoking advocates.  First there is the desire of BR to get rid of Naylor and Naylor's subsequent alliance with the Captain.  There is Nick's hiding from the FBI and his revenge on Peter Lorre, the man who attempted to kill him.  And then there his personal life - his sexual escapades, his relationship with Joey, his twelve year-old son, and his meetings with the Mod Squad.  It all fits together very well in the story.  Buckley's use of the third person is at times so intimate that it feels person.  Naylor's voice is clear and speaks directly to the reader.  The book begins by introducing  you tot he world of Nick Naylor, and does a wonderful job of doing so.  It shows you what goes on in the ATS, and gives great characterization of the people he works with.  The plot quickly moves ahead when Nick gets abducted by the anti-smoking terrorists paid off by BR.  This sets the tone for the fast pace of the novel which is maintained by the wit of Nick and his friends in the Mod Squad and the skill of the author to tell the reader only what's necessary.  In fact, Nick's relationship with the Mod Squad was my favorite part of the book.  Each of their characters is so perfect, and Bobby Jay especially was hilarious.  The end of the book is also very well-done as what happens is so unexpected yet so understandable.  This book is a must-read for anybody who likes to root for the bad guy or who wonders what goes on in the mind of the enemy. Great cultural commentary.
0060976624|4.0|Even with a short attention span, a dislike for contemporary fiction and a natural resistance to forced reading assignments, I managed to thoroughly enjoy the wit and humor found in Christopher Buckley's Thank You for Smoking.   The protagonist is the antagonist; the attitude is dark yet truthful and the characters artfully dynamic.  Nick Naylor is the chief spokesperson for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.  He pays his mortgage by stretching, twisting and hiding the truth about tobacco from the public, and as a result lives his life as a target for despise.  Buckley's talent as a writer concisely and sarcastically reveals the culmination of events that grow from Naylor's continual and conscious lying.  The readers' separation from Nick's dangerous life provides perspective for humor - continuing to prove the \\"it's funny when someone else falls down\\" theory.  As Nick's awareness and follies increase so does the readers' fondness for this tragic hero.     When boss-man, BR, turns up the heat, Nick's urgency to regain the integrity of tobacco for a newly health-conscious society shifts into a high gear.  He begins to make blatantly false public statements that in turn introduce him to death-threatening enemies and the praise of the Captain, the tobacco-god.  With manic intensity he continues to finagle his way into the media until he is so deeply loved and hated that bodyguards, FBI interrogations and secrete plots with his fellow \\"Merchants of Death\\" become necessary.  Oddly, Nick's increasingly good job results in an increasingly malignant response from his boss, and the notion of internal tobacco scandal calls for extreme measures.     The curious scandal and how Nick manipulates and escapes brilliantly fuels the plot.  Buckley writes with a mesmerizing tempo, gluing your eyes to the pages.  Between his cynicism, humor and talent for creating anticipation, Buckley weaves Thank you for Smoking into a book that is impossible to leave unfinished.  My only criticism isthe last chapter, which is weak and jumps almost too radically to a pleasant conclusion, however the fury of events leading up to that single final chapter makes the book well-worth the read.

B000002U82|5.0|&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is a true work of art. Ever song on this CD is unbelivably great! Roger Water's lyrics are very meaningful and David Gilmour's guitar playing is the best, especially the guitar solo in &quot;Time&quot;. &quot;Us and Them&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot; is a good example of Pink Floyd's great talent. This CD is a must for the Rock Fan!
6305750750|2.0|This is the kind of movie you make when you have unchecked authority, no limit to what you can spend, ready access to all the special effects you could possibly want to use, and little concern about what your audience actually cares for.  A sad heartless creation, &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; wants to win us with stunning visual elements and sound effects.  These overwhelm the few attempts to give us suspense and drama...which fail for anyone familiar with adventure stories because they are tired and obvious.  Disappointingly little is done with the capable cast.  And when familiar characters appear, they give us no additional insight into who they are (or why their role in this movie is necessary).  Granted, the film-maker had a great burden of viewer expectations to handle...but one would hope that these expectations might have been used beneficially.  Rather it seems they were avoided in order to provide something that no one else had suggested.  Of course, this movie also had to fit into the series and needed to lay the groundwork for the planned sequels.  But it should have been designed to stand on its own.  Instead, the audience is presented with little more than a parade of characters and an introduction to what lies ahead.  The first movie filmed in the series -- Episode 4 -- was able to accomplish that and much more.
B000002LEM|5.0|In their final days with David Lee Roth, Van Halen found themselves running low on creative energy, and it showed on their final Roth-era release, the dismal &quot;1984,&quot; which was half filler and, with a few exceptions, well below their earlier releases in term of songwriting consistency.  After Roth's departure in 1985, Sammy Hagar joined and Edward Van Halen found his creative juices replenished, because they then released one of their finest LPs, &quot;5150.&quot;  However, the best was yet to come. After proving their enduring popularity sans David Lee Roth with 1986's &quot;5150,&quot; Van Halen returned two years later with &quot;OU812.&quot;  It was here that Eddie proved that not only was he one of the colossal guitarists in rock history, but also a first-rate songwriter and keyboardist as well.  Lyrically, this is the best writing Sammy Hagar ever did for Van Halen, while Eddie's guitar work remains searing, emotive and inventive.  His songwriting, however, exploded with newfound maturity, confidence and artistry.  Edward Van Halen has said many times that he considers himself more of a songwriter than a gunslinging guitarist, and &quot;OU812&quot; shows why: from the pulsing, keyboard driven &quot;Feels So Good&quot; to the country-inflected &quot;Finish What Ya Started,&quot; Eddie's writing shows an unexpected stylistic catholicism and assurance lacking in any other Van Halen album before or since.  And there's still plenty of frenetic, hair-raising guitar on &quot;OU812&quot; (&quot;Source of Infection,&quot; &quot;AFU,&quot; &quot;Cabo Wabo&quot;) to satisfy old-style purists who don't like Eddie's keyboard experiments.  While many prefer Van Halen's older, party-oriented releases with David Lee Roth, &quot;OU812&quot; shows one of rock's finest writer/instrumentalists at his absolute creative zenith.  Highly recommended.
B00003CWTI|2.0|You wade through three hours of a decent film to encounter one of the wirst endings I've seen on a film since - geez I don't remember when.  Don't bother with this clunker.  I went to fil school and I still don't think it's &quot;cool.&quot;  Director PTA should rot in h-e-double hockey stciks for offering this up as his follow-up to &quot;Boogie Nights.&quot;  Sure, the Aimee Mann sing along is cool, but he could have made that a music video, in fact music videos is all he's good for at this point.  He's been directing annorexic girlfriend Fionna Applegate's videos for the past few years.  Couldn't he have spared Tom Cruise's best performance for a better film?
0553106635|5.0|Everyone who is interested in reading this book will have read the first two, so I will not waste everyone's time talking about how Martin plays for keeps and isn't afraid to kill good guys, kill bad guys and make you stare at the book like you are the dumbest person in the world for not realizing this is what he had to do to move the story forward.  <br />This is definately one of the best books I have ever read.  No book has elicited such an emotional response.  This book is what I call the total package.  A good story, excelent dialogue, violence, romance (real life romance not that sugar coated crap of pulp romance novels), and most importantly it moves the story along.<br />When I was asked to describe to a friend after I handed him my copy of the book to read, he asked me to sum it up in 1 sentence.  I said this was the Empire Strikes Back of the Song of Ice and Fire series.  It falls right in the middle, and it explores the darkest aspects of the trilogy, and I don't see how Martin could possibly write a better set of three books.<br />I will keep reading them as long as Jon doesn't go exploring in the north and happen upon a group of unsuspecting midget bear looking things calling themselves ewoks.  I just don't think I could handle that.
0811826848|5.0|As a first generation Beatlesfan,I have read many books over the years on the Beatles.Some excellent,some good but most just plain exploitive.Because of the principals involved namely John,Paul,George,Ringo et.al,this tome(no exaggeration)offers as close to a definitive look into their history as we are likely to receive.As such it is a beautiful and awesome undertaking. The text is revealing with some insightful and perceptible comments, though I suspect some of it is revisionist.The photographs and artwork are exceptional,if a tad familiar.Fortunately there are many I've never seen. The coffee table design is a bit cumbersome but I imagine that would be the only practical layout.One thought,however, intrigues me while reading this anthology. I can't help but wonder what John Lennon's contemporary views on his Beatle past and this book would be.At any rate, the Beatles appeal is timeless and in my life I've loved them all.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Kid A has now been released, so as I listen to where Radiohead is now in their prolific brilliance, it is good to comment on their last CD and see where they come from.  OK Computer is by all means a work of art that truly is on the line of the trajectory to which this band is headed.<br />Lauded, correctly or incorrectly, as the next U2, Radiohead's passion and rock roots in Pablo Honey and The Bends established them as an intelligent, quirky, and insightful band with lyrics sculpted to captivate and disturb.<br />With OK Computer, Radiohead matured into lyrics that delve into our techno-obsessed culture.  With screaming guitar calling you to listen and listen well, the sum total of the CD is more than the parts.  At times the lyrics are not clear in their immediate intent, yet the whole tone of the CD gives you the impression that I should be very angry, angry at what I have accepted as the norm.  Big buildings, pollution, and the ever-present acquiescence to computers (Ok COMPUTER!) makes me uncomfortable.  This is no luddite whining - this CD is a prophetic call to rediscover what it means to be human.
0679416781|4.0|This book is a touching story about the truth of love, and the impossibility of a doomed romance.  I really enjoyed the read, and thought that all in all it was a touchong book.  While The English Patient gets long-winded at times, all in all I really enjoyed the book.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I must say that this is not my favorite U2 album.  It has sounds that I was not expecting from them, it uses a producer that does not use them in the way that I am used to.<br />Nonetheless, this is a wonderful CD.  And I can't help but grow to love it.  With writing like this and Edge's foray into new types of guitar screams, it still gives me the shivers.  U2 are still in their &quot;over the top&quot; mode with Popmart, yet they still know how to touch the heart with raw emotion.<br />Please is a stirring, anthemic call to Ireland, begging for a change and to think of peace, to put off traditionalism.  Gone is a sonically crashing song that uses Bono's soaring plaintive voice.  If God Would Send His Angels asks the age old questions of God in a new way; it is beautiful and pretty.  Wake Up Dead Man goes a step further - it is NOT pretty, but heartwrenching and powerful.<br />This IS a different U2, as different as their change from Joshua Tree to Achtung Baby.  Consequently, some people may be put off with their attempt to try new things.  I admire them for that.  I admire them because I think they are a band that truly cares about music.
B00001NFCY|1.0|This album is pathetic. The music sounds old and uninspired, the lyrics are the worst string of cliches I have seen this year...and the VOCALS. Don't get me started.<br />I really tried to like this band. But this music is just so fake. Couple that with the fact that Mark Tremonti did an interview and openly bashed the bands Creed rips off (Nirvana, Pearl Jam) and going so far as to say Scott Stapp barely sounds like Eddie Vedder...it's all too much. I don't only dislike this band...I *hate* it. I LOATHE this cheap excuse for grunge.<br />And you can go ahead and click this review was not helpful. It's not that I'm trying to put down fans of this sound...I just want to say, if you like Creed's sound, and it's new to you...check out bands like Stone Temple Pilots, Alice In Chains and Pearl Jam. Those bands are Creed with better music, lyrics, singers and most of all...they have real emotion.
B00003CWTH|5.0|I say unequivicably that this is the best movie of the year.  P.T. Anderson has gone out of his way to weave a captivating, heartwrenching and very quirky story.  Correction - stories; he has brought together the lives of several people, linked in various ways.<br />With Aimee Mann singing wonderfully, especially for the movie and some incredible acting, this movie was fascinating and disturbing.  And the scene where everyone sang all at once was a wonderfully symbolic and bold gesture that some may have found odd, but I absolutely loved.<br />And what about the frogs?  Again, even more bold and extremely disconcerting if you don't watch the movie closely.  It a bit hard to explain, but basically, he plays with the idea of the possibility of this happening....unrweal as it seems. After all, &quot;this really happened&quot;.  Moreover, it touches on biblical issues - the sins of a generation being punished by frogs, as warned in Exodus....so is it just a coincidence or is it a miracle? Urban Legend or real?  It makes you think.<br />Tom Cruise was brilliant.  The tension in the film as this mysogynist was being interviewed was palpable, a tribute to Anderson's direction.<br />There are few movies that are as bold and thought provoking as this.  But get ready for something different.
0553573403|5.0|It's difficult to add something to what other enthusiastic reviewers already said. I just want to underline how the strong sense of reality this book transmits, is not due to the absence of elves, orcs and other usual fantasy stuff. The book is so real, so entangling, because of characters' depth. Do you really believe men like Richard Cypher or Aragorn could ever exist ?  Martin's characters could.
B00004XONN|4.0|These guys are musical geniuses, there is no question of that.  Their passion has been channeled into an album that defies traditional music, making it all the more remarkable that they are also an uber-band, a well known (dare I say mainstream) band that is not afraid to be ridiculed for rejecting their historical musical roots.<br />There is not a single song that follows a traditional ballad form.  Many are 2 or 3 lines that are releated several times.  Some songs, like Kid A itself, you can't even make out the words.  Perhaps the distortion allows one to try and put their own words to the music.<br />From the freeflowing hyper jazz sounds at the end of National Anthen to the atmospheric gentleness of Treefingers, Radiohead captivates their listeners with either a cacaphony of sound or the gentle lilting sounds of a quiet guitar, or even a harp.<br />It is refreshing that this album is #1.  It is good to see the public appreciate something so daring and different.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that very little of this CD is radio-friendly.  Given their dislike for the corporate game, it may be that this is just wahat they want.  And bravo to them!
0425107469|5.0|You can imagine what a page turner this novel was that I couldn't keep it down even when I was undergoing an ultrasound! I so vividly remember that day when my parents thought the pain I was having was because of appendicitus and took me to the hospital but I just couldn't keep this book down. It is almost as if you were a part of all that was going on in the plot, your feelings on a roller coaster ride, feeling sympathies for the bad guy (you have to read to find out). The Einstien's character is one of the amazing portrayals I've ever come across. <br />The movie later on never did justice to the book, so please don't watch the movie!<br />Oh yeah, the reason I picked up Koontz was because of the relatively smaller size novels he writes when compared to Stephen Kings. Back in undergrad school as EE major, we were really short of time and there just wasn't enough time to read mega King's novels. A friend of mine handed me this copy of Koontz and wow! I was a believer in Koontz from that day onwards. <br />Another thing I love about Koontz is the fact that his story develops from the very first page and sorts of grips you right there. Perhaps this was the best of Koontz I've read so far.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|This CD is really a collection of Lenny Kravitz' very best hits. If you don't yet have all of his CDs, you should get this one. All songs are well-known, the most recent ones &quot;Fly Away&quot;, &quot;American Woman&quot; and &quot;Again&quot; are worth the price. But you also get his classic songs like &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; or &quot;Stand by my Woman&quot;. But hey, the list of titles speaks for itself. <br />By the way, the CD fits exactly on a 60min tape, so I can listen to it in the car as well.
6300214435|5.0|The second installment in the Indiana Jones, set 2 years before Raiders, finds Indy going after the Shonkara stones and trying to rescue children enslaved by the Thagee Cult. He is joined by young Short Round (Key He Quan) and nighclub vocalist Willie Scott, played very well by Kate Capshaw, the current Mrs.Spielberg. While Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood was a two-fisted hellraiser, Scott is a pampered indoor brat, and in turn is brilliant, plus her character is quite funny also, as is Short Round. Amrish Puri is a chilling as the villainous cult leader. <br />Though Temple of Doom lacks Sallah, Marcus Brody, and the Nazis, it is an improvement over Raiders in more than a few ways. To start, Ford is even better as Indy for his character is tested more. Douglas Slocombe's photography is more effective, and John Williams' music score is even more diverse and genius. Temple of Doom is also more creative, emotionally effective, and imaginative. However, it lacks the spectacle of the first film and is far more controversial and violent.This is the movie that created the PG-13 rating.<br />Dennis Muren's stunning Oscar-winning visual effects match Richard Edlund's effects in Raiders, yet they are not as awe-inspiring or important to the story. Elliot Scott's production design is terrific, and the cult sequences are very intense. The stunts top the ones in Raiders and are really good. The most memorable sequences have to be the mine car chase, the creature feature dinner, the Shanghai nightclub opening, the duel at the cult platform, and the rope bridge finale, incredible. Though Temple of Doom isn't as good as Raiders or Last Crusade it is highly recommended and is one of the best adventure films ever made.
6305627401|5.0|Oaky. Some people say this mnovie is a little to much come on, you have to laugh. If you are a die-hard South Park fan as my self you can't help but love this movie. I think it is a little better than the TV show. It answerd some questions about the show including Kenny's true identity. I would recomnmnend this movie to anyone who likes to have fun. Or anyone who is a Cartman fan. I own this movie on DVD and I watch it anytime I need a good laugh.
B000001F5F|5.0|This is an amazing live cd! I was not fortunate enough to have been at this show, but everytime I either listen to the cd, or watch the video, I feel like I am there; on a cold, foggy, wet evening in Colorado in 1983. I never tire of hearing or watching it, and all I can say is GOD, I WISH I'D BEEN THERE!!!
0898705525|5.0|Orthodoxy is written for the poet and the child in each of us (The latter being that part of us Jesus said can inherit the Kingdom).  Orthodoxy is, at the same time, one of the wisest, and funniest, books I have ever read; almost up to the level of Everlasting Man.  It seems to me he does give a logically challenging, if rather whimsical, argument for the Christian faith here.  And having read many of the most famous skeptics of our time, his argument remains no less timely, powerful, and suggestive.   <br />How do I explain the reaction of the reader below, then, who appears intelligent, but finds &quot;Little that is intellectually bearable&quot; in this book, and could not even read it through once without throwing it down in disgust?  For one thing, Chesterton's approach is not scientific, but psychological.  For those to whom science is the only god, a little prior reading might be worthwhile -- John Polkinghome or Hugh Ross on evidences for the Creator in modern cosmology, for example.  Let Scott Peck's People of The Lie search your heart.  Or even try my book, Jesus and the Religions of Man, which offers empirical evidence of a more historical nature for the truth of the Christian claims. Let the facts presented in these books take the edge of your arrogance.  <br />Then, maybe, go for a walk through Mt. Rainier National Park when the huckleberries are reddening in the fall, or skin dive in Hawaii.  Or walk through a dark forest on a clear night when the stars are out.  Observe and wonder.  Become a child again.  Laugh at your certainties and prejudices a little.  Then try reading this book again.  <br />&quot;(Skepticism) discredits supernatural stories that have some foundation, simply by telling natural stories that have no foundation.&quot;  &quot;The only fun of being a Christian was that a man was not left alone with the Inner Light, but definitely recognized an outer Light, fair as the sun. . .&quot;&quot;To be allowed to make love to the moon and thento complain that Jupiter kept his own moons in a harem seemed to me a vulgar anti-climax.&quot;  You still don't see the relevence or wisdom of such teachings?  Oh, well.  Chesterton did warn, &quot;If a man would make his world large, he must be always making himself small. . . It is impossible without humility to enjoy anything -- even pride.&quot;  This book, I guess, is no exception.
6300214028|5.0|Created at the dawn of the Reagan era, it took a lot of guts on Warren Beatty's part to put out this rather favorable view of American socialist-turned-communist John Reed.  <br />But while the viewer will learn of some of the more unsavory aspects of life in the land of the free (such as Woodrow Wilson's Palmer raids in suppression of free speech, and the real reason our pompous messianic leader led us into the First World War), the film is not a hymn of praise to Communism.  It is instead a portrait of lives lived to the full -- maybe not, to be sure, the way we would choose to live our lives; but it certainly depicts lives lived beyond the category of drones in what is supposed to pass for democracy in America.<br />As Reed, Beatty infuses his character with an energy and dynamism that probably exceed the original template.  And to the character of the &quot;Queen of Bohemia,&quot; Louise Bryant, Diane Keaton brings a luminous beauty that grows along with her character.  Jack Nicholson is wonderful as the jaded Eugene O'Neill, and a host of other actors make this film one of the most richly cast films of the era.<br />Communism is dead now, and as for socialism, any glance at a public restroom will demonstrate the regard that people have for property not their own.  Part of the appeal of this film, as with the ideologies it depicts, lies in the romantic myth spawned by Rousseau that, once liberated of the shackles of civilization, humanity will be reborn and therefore truly free.  As to whether that same humanity will be happy is quite another question, and one which the film implicitly answers in the negative.  For those interested in where the most noble parts of these ideas may lead a truly honest person, I suggest that you purchase a film called &quot;Entertaining Angels.&quot;  It is about a woman who knew some of the people depicted in &quot;Reds&quot; and shared many of their ideas to her dying day, Dorothy Day, the co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement.  She may one day become a canonized saint.  She is already an inspiration to many, and her ideas are far from the dustbin of history.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love Linkin Park although I dont like other bands in it's category.  Instead of combining rap and rock at the same time, different parts of a song are one or the other.  Also, some songs are more rapish while others are more rockish.  I noticed that LP has moved from more rap to more rock, although I love their style eitherway
B00000AD94|4.0|First of all, there are way too many of you comparing these guys to the heavies of the proggy 70's. Sure, there's the obvious inspirations, but these guys have their own sound. As for the lyrics, geez, remember when stringing words together could be...fun?  The reviewers complaning about &quot;Senor Velasco&quot; should take a cold hard look at the nonsense of &quot;Willow Farm&quot;<br />The Light is a great debut... and things only get better on their next effort &quot;Beware of Darkness&quot;
0448060191|2.0|I did, at age 8 or so, though, re-reading it today, I find itrather grim and dull. Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.<br />Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.<br />That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the &quot;poor&quot; outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood.

0061020710|5.0|This is the first book of the Discworld series. I have read other Discworld books, but I think this one is still the best.<br />The setting is (try guessing) the magical Discworld (carried on the backs of four elephants, which themself walk on the Great A'Tuin, the turtle that carries the whole disc world).<br />The characters are very funny (I don't think they'd remind you of anyone you know, but so what?). Rincewind, the magician that knows only one spell and is afraid to say it, Twoflower, the first (and probably last) tourist on the disc, also an insurance (in-sewer-ants), agent, and the Luggage, a box made of sapient pearwood, the rarest tree on the disc, ready to eat anything (especially people who do bad things to his owner, Twoflower).<br />The book is so interesting, you are not gonna be able to stop reading until you've come to the last page.
B00003CXGG|2.0|I can't really write a review here on the content of the movie, but if this say's anything for it... I tryed to watch it 3 times fell to sleep each time. it was just to boring for me. there were a few good fights but all and all it just put me to sleep.
B00004XQP4|4.0|The reviews on this album crack me up.  I try not to get hung up on what a band has done in the past.  Seems a lot of these people want this band to keep playing the same kind of music or they consider it a betrayal.  Same crap you see on any modern Metallica album.  Wouldn't you get bored to tears playing the same music for over a decade?  These guys aren't freakin' teenagers anymore.  <br />Anyhow, I liked this cd.  I've got Dookie and rest.  Yes this is a little lighter although the lyrics are about the same level.  They opted for a little more acoustic sound. I like it a lot.  To be honest I'm not sure I would have bought another Green Day cd if the single &quot;Minority&quot; wouldn't have sounded different than previous Green Day cds.  They gave a little hint that they were getting bored with normal punk rock on Nimrod.  (I actually liked Dookie better than Nimrod)  <br />Really liked the title track and the majority of the songs are good.  There's so few good rock cd's coming out.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby is an awesome, creative musician. His music is tops in almost every review, and he's a platinum selling artist.    A lot of his sequencing is done by computer. His computer of choice? Why the computer of choice for creative people everywhere, a Macintosh.
B00004XONN|2.0|Working hard for my money, I don't enjoy being let down by a group trying to experiment all the time (I should have know better) OK, Computer opened new grounds on the rock arena, but KID A sucks. There is no Karma Police, no Exit Music to a Film, no No Surprises. NOTHING. Electronic sounds, silly landscapes and programming ... you call this rock? Give me IRON MAIDEN!<br />The booklet (&quot;limited edition&quot; and all) is total junk (no lyrics, no photo's, no innovative drawings as on OK,Computer) and just goes to show that there is such a thing as &quot;overexperimentating&quot;.<br />I must also say that after a while one starts to get used to it (my first instinct was to take it back), even gets interesting, in fact I can understand why some call it revolutionary. (Don't compare with Pink Floyd, PLEASE!). But WHY all the effort, when something like Mark Knopfler immediately goes well on the ear!?!
B00004Z459|5.0|Sweet Lord!  What a great cd!!  I downloaded the whole album off of Napster about 2 months ago, and liked the cd so much that I went out and bought it today as well.  I have been listening to it pretty much constantly ever since I've had it, and it never gets old.  They mix the new metal sound with electronics and hard hitting bass, and then throw in 2 vocalists.  By now, I'm sure you've heard &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, their single off of the album, but any song could easily be the single.  Every track is THAT good.  I've let many of my friends hear it, and they have all loved it.  So far, I know 6 of my friends bought it.  I think that sooner or later, all of America is gonna be blasting Hybrid Theory from their stereos, because it has definate crossover potential.  The best tracks (the cream of the crop, because just like I've said, they're all good) are &quot;Papercut&quot;, &quot;Points of Authority&quot;, &quot;One Step Closer&quot;, and &quot;Be Myself&quot;.  I highly highly suggest this cd, as it ranks in the top 5 of my favorite cds-hard to do-I have around 600.  Be sure you go and see them if they come to your town too....they're touring with Hed P.E.  If you don't, you should have someone kick you in the eye.
0684847248|5.0|The book opens with the words &quot;Life is difficult.&quot; Once you accept that, it becomes a lot easier!<br />But most of us don't accept that.  We think if we do things the right way, or if other people would, then eventually life would become easier.  Our material needs will be met, love will bloom forever, bad things won't happen to us, and life will unfold according to our individual needs and wishes.<br />Guess again. If you're constantly trying hard and finding life to be a major disappointment, you may find comfort and practical help in the reading and re-reading of this book.<br />Peck writes in an easy to read, easy to understand manner, writing of his life and that of many of his own patients. He begins with a section on Discipline; the next is on Love; then Growth and Religion; closing (how appropriately) with Grace.<br />When first I read this, in my mid-twenties, (living life in what one of my 'friends' called Life in the Breakdown Lane) the sections didn't look like they'd offer anything to help me.  Discipline was something I wanted to act out against, not find solace in.  The section on Love, I was disappointed to find, did NOT provide any instructions on how to find a knight on a white horse.  Growth and Religion seemed some kind of a paradox to me, and I was sure that Grace was nothing more than a name I wished I had.<br />But within those Sections I have again and again(at different levels) found peace of mind through solutions that at first I didn't fully understand, but came to believe in -- for anyone looking for help in improving their lives, from a non-dogmatic, non-fundamentalist point of view, I'd strongly recommend this book.<br />Read it, learn from it, and just as happens to the bunny in the children's book, The Velveteen Rabbit, you'll find yourself becoming more alive, and more 'real.'<br />I'd also encourage the reading of Sheldon Kopp's &quot;If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him&quot; and (if you're looking for some comic relief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).ic relief, always good when stressed) watch &quot;Groundhog Day.&quot;<br />This is truly a gem of a book (though I haven't liked many others of his).
B00004YKUX|5.0|This is a great album, better than Unchained but not as good at American Recordings.  He sounds a little frail, but it only adds to the power of his vocals.  But I must comment on some misconceptions stated by others:  JOHNNY CASH IS NOT DYING, HE WAS MISDIAGNOSED WITH A RARE NUEROLOGICAL DISORDER!  HE FOUND OUT ABOUT A YEAR AGO THAT HE NEVER HAD THE DISEASE.  ALTHOUGH HE DOES HAVE DIABETES AND SOME OTHER AILMENTS, HE IS NOT TERMINALLY ILL AND IS IN FACT ALREADY WORKING ON ANOTHER ALBUM.  HE SAYS HE WILL NOT TOUR AGAIN, HOWEVER, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO RECORD.
0790744759|1.0|Meet Me in St. Louis is one of those insidiously bad movies that looks and acts like something worthwhile or entertaining, and even worse, manages to fool great scores of viewers into liking it.  I greatly enjoy Singin' in the Rain and many of the Disney animated musicals, and I watched this movie expecting to like it, but I ended up hating nearly every single deceptive, ridiculous little moment.  The narrative is unsure of what it wants to be about-- initially the film focuses on Rose and her boyfriend in New York, but then it discards that story to focus on the much-less-interesting romance between Judy Garland and that completely generic Guy Next Door, and then the movie shifts *again* to the family crisis of whether the family will relocate to New York.  This is done because none of these stories are interesting enough to work on their own, but even their combined momentum doesn't amount to much.  Even worse is the film's ideology.  This is a movie that actually believes things were better back when young women forced themselves into corsets to impress the boys.  It also glorifies a bunch of people who decide to keep everything in their lives exactly the way it has always been, rather than move to a different city where they would be more successful and where they could make friends just as good as the ones they have in St. Louis.  The film helps perpetuate one of the most horrible falsehoods of our society-- the idea that change is bad and that the traditional way is always the best.  Of course, all of these complaints would be meaningless if the songs were catchy and funny and moving, but unfortunately none of the musical numbers reach escape velocity.  The only remotely worthwhile moments involve the little girl who makes funny, morbid comments and decapitates her snowmen; otherwise the whole movie is a waste of time, and one of the most overrated films in history.
0553108034|5.0|Well what can I say? this book was so compelling i just could'nt put it down! Why you ask? because of the limitless twists and curves that kept you on the edge of your seat in this roller coaster ride of imagination. I have not read another author's work that can compare. George R.R. Martin is truly a master of Fantasy...
B000002N25|5.0|Golden Heart by Mark Knopfler is just an awesome cd. Mark Knopfler cannot be put in any category of music style. He sings everything from rock to fun fast paced music.... from slow love songs to songs about history... He's just a really cool artist and I think his cd Golden Heart reflects his many interests in different types of music. <br />There isn't a song on the cd that I don't like. My favorite songs are &quot;Darling Pretty&quot; and &quot;Golden Heart&quot;. Both of which are love songs.... My other favorite song is &quot;Done with Bonaparte&quot; a song about Napoleon Bonaparts dreams of conquest, and the hurt it cost its people.<br />Another thing about Knopfler is his Lyrics. Honestly, I don't know how they came to him. The songs flow very well, and paint a picture of the feelings. <br />This cd is amazing! My first time through I was awestruck, I am so happy that my friend introduced me to Knopfler and I hope by reading this and taking my advice; I really hope YOU will enjoy this cd as much as I have.... Its what I have been looking for, for so long.... Music that can make me feel.
B00000K3G8|5.0|The movie remains one of the greatest, if not THE greatest, concert film of all time, and this re-release finally does it justice.  While the earlier version was just a sort of live greatest hits CD, this one is a more complete look at the band and its skills.  From the simplicity of &quot;Psycho Killer,&quot; which consists solely of David Byrne playing an acoustic guitar over the rhythm of a boombox to the lush orchestration and gospel-inspired power of &quot;Take Me To The River,&quot; this CD amazes.  The addition of &quot;Heaven&quot; &quot;Crosseyed and Painless&quot; and others add depth and breadth.<br />The truly remarkable thing about Talking Heads is that they make intelligent music.  Not only are their lyrics far more sophisticated than just about any other band, but the music is also a notch above.  They play challenging chord progressions, non-syncopated drum beats and complicated harmonies that force us to listen to music in entirely different ways.  And although this album precedes Byrne's total immersion into world music, you can definitely see its influence in the music.  This album belongs on the shelf of anyone who considers himself/herself a fan of music.

B000002UAR|5.0|Of all the Beatles' albums, Revolver has probably aged best. 'Yellow Submarine' is a dud, pure and simple, but this set makes up the band's greatest achievement. Capitol's exploitative policy of subtracting a few tracks from one Beatles album to whack onto the next was never more despicable. <br />'Taxman' kicks off the set admirably, although Harrison's lament jars a bit - I mean, why is he complaining about paying his fair share of tax, anyway? Is this the same bloke who wrote 'Living in the Material World'? Still, this track, along with his other contributions (4, 10),  demonstrate how far Harrison had come as a songwriter. <br />Lennon and McCartney were at their top here. Macca's ballads (2, 5, 10), helped along by some fine Martin arrangements, are probably the best he ever wrote, stopping this side of schmalzy, while Lennon's major contributions (3, 7, 14) are quite brilliant. (Although it's probably the soundscape of 'Tomorrow Never Knows', mainly courtesy of spooky tape loops and a huge drum sound, that make it such a standout.)<br />'And Your Bird Can Sing' and 'Doctor Robert' are often described as weak tracks, but I can't find too much wrong with them. If nothing else, the former boasts fine harmonised lead guitar parts and the latter a catchy groove.<br />The sounds which the Fabs, producer George Martin and engineer Geoff Emerick were able to coax from ageing studio hardware are remarkable. Macca's close-miked bass is right up there in the mix, clear as a bell, Ringo's drums sound terrific even today, and there are interesting guitar sounds everywhere. As well, Revolver extends the experiment with backwards parts which had begun on 'Rain', and is used to great effect here. The musicianship, particularly McCartney's bass playing, is great throughout. Honourable mention to R. Starkey for 'She Said She Said'.<br />Bookended by two magnificent double-A side 45s ('Rain'/'Paperback Writer'; 'Strawberry Fields Forever'/'Penny Lane'), this album is demonstrably the Beatles' creative peak, and you can see why Brian Wilson was inspired to go one better with Pet Sounds. Essential.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|what can i say lenny does it abain. bravo!!
B00000253N|5.0|WARNING: Do not play this album if you are getting over a broken heart - you'll be drowning in your own tears by the second track.  (On second thoughts, play 'Idiot Wind' as loud and as often as possible.)<br />On Blood On The Tracks, Dylan sheds the obtuseness that characterised so much of his output to this point, and sings straight from the heart. But these are not syrupy love songs. Tenderness, regret, bitterness, and anger are here in equal measure, served up with some of the most tuneful melodies and singing BD ever managed. And the lyrics are stupendous, even for Dylan.<br />If pushed, I'd nominate 'Simple Twist Of Fate' as the standout track, but this is one of those fabulous discs where, just as you think 'That's the best track on the album', along comes another corker.<br />Ask around and you'll find there are lots of people who count this as their favourite Dylan album. It's certainly his best since the halcyon days of the mid-'60s. Truly beautiful.
B00000DFSK|4.0|I agree with almost everything that Jeff Blehar wrote about in his review (see below).  They could've added a lot more songs to this greatest hits album, such as &quot;Out of Control&quot; from BOY, &quot;Two Hearts Beat As One&quot; from WAR, &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; from UNFORGETTABLE FIRE, &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; from JOSHUA TREE (probably my FAVORITE U2 song ever!), and &quot;In God's Country&quot; from JOSHUA TREE.  Not a bad greatest hits album but could've been better.
B00004XPP0|1.0|The re-release of the Star Wars Trilogy on VHS for the third (or is it fourth) time is an affront to fans.  This newest release appears to offer nothing new but a trailer to Episode II.  As fans eagerly await the DVD release, Lucasfilm has ignored their wishes, but instead has insulted fans by asking them to spend even more money on VHS tapes that will be replaced when the eventual DVD release is distributed.  Shame on George Lucas!
6300214435|5.0|The second installment in the Indiana Jones, set 2 years before Raiders, finds Indy going after the Shonkara stones and trying to rescue children enslaved by the Thagee Cult. He is joined by young Short Round (Key He Quan) and nighclub vocalist Willie Scott, played very well by Kate Capshaw, the current Mrs.Spielberg. While Karen Allen's Marion Ravenwood was a two-fisted hellraiser, Scott is a pampered indoor brat, and in turn is brilliant, plus her character is quite funny also, as is Short Round. Amrish Puri is a chilling as the villainous cult leader. <br />Though Temple of Doom lacks Sallah, Marcus Brody, and the Nazis, it is an improvement over Raiders in more than a few ways. To start, Ford is even better as Indy for his character is tested more. Douglas Slocombe's photography is more effective, and John Williams' music score is even more diverse and genius. Temple of Doom is also more creative, emotionally effective, and imaginative. However, it lacks the spectacle of the first film and is far more controversial and violent.This is the movie that created the PG-13 rating.<br />Dennis Muren's stunning Oscar-winning visual effects match Richard Edlund's effects in Raiders, yet they are not as awe-inspiring or important to the story. Elliot Scott's production design is terrific, and the cult sequences are very intense. The stunts top the ones in Raiders and are really good. The most memorable sequences have to be the mine car chase, the creature feature dinner, the Shanghai nightclub opening, the duel at the cult platform, and the rope bridge finale, incredible. Though Temple of Doom isn't as good as Raiders or Last Crusade it is highly recommended and is one of the best adventure films ever made.
6303039456|5.0|Walt Disney knows better than anyone else how to associate comedy and deep reflection for the widest public possible, the family. In this film the situation is of course incongruous :  four Jamaican athletes deciding to go to the Calgary Olympics in 1988 as a bobsledding team. Walt Disney uses all possible contradiction to make the story funny : warm Jamaica versus cold Canada, blacks versus whites, Jamaican easygoing spirit versus caucasian single-aimed concentration, father versus son, mother versus son, etc. But, and that is the real ethical genius of Walt Disney, every single laugh they create is there to deepen the best of all human morality. The main two ideas are : 1- Be proud of your roots and nature because that is your winning force ; 2- Refuse any kind of inferiority complex because you're different, and reject any kind of racism against your difference. Your difference is your strength and that is true of anyone, not only of people of a different color. It is true about culture, personality, sex, color, you name it you have it. This film is the best demonstration that the most powerful affirmative action comes from inside the individual, inside the team, inside the group you belong to, not from outside. Yet it is necessary to have a go-between, in this case a caucasian coach. He knows how to rebuff and negociate « racist » reactions. And he succeeds. And do not forget this marvelous lesson the end of this film gives you : no matter what, it is more important to take part and to cross the finish line than to win the gold medal, especially because if you only look at winning, you may be tempted to cheat. The aim of any human being on this earth is to achieve the best things he or she can, and to reach the finish line, the goal of his or her adventure, the aim of his or her attempt, and reaching that aim takes courage, strength, honor, honesty and moral beauty. This film should be shown in all schools all over the world for everyone to see what it takes to be oneself and what being oneself can give to the world. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universites II and IX.be oneself and what being oneself can give to the world. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, Paris Universites II and IX.
B00003CWTH|5.0|Magnolia left me stunned, thoughtful, and more than a little unnerved. The movie chronicles the unraveling of the lives of a large cast of characters, all of whom are revealed to relate to the others in some way, and finds a moral redemption from the chaos.  It has a dark fascination similar to American Beauty's.  In fact, of those two excellent movies, I would say Magnolia is the stronger.  It's not a movie for those who want shallow, stupid entertainment; it will disturb you and (God forbid!) make you think.  Wonderful.  (It will also have you looking nervously at storm clouds for months; see it and find out why....)
0780626494|5.0|If you want something sweet, warm and funny, this movie is just for you. It is not one of those &quot;talking movies&quot; where you have to chase every word or you wouldn't understand anything. Also it's not slow motion movie that makes you sleep or go to  kitchen for a quick sandwish. You sit down and start watching and i guarantee that you won't leave your couch until &quot;Blast of the Past&quot; is over. Check it out!
0790742705|5.0|I think this movie is pritty darn good. It had very good Gremlinpuppets. It's funny when the gremlins were in the movies and blew up.It would be a good ideafor a Grimlins 3 movie. But I think Grimlins 2was better then the first.
B00004W5UA|5.0|After seeing this brilliant, definitive-of-our-time movie trashed left and right by...other critcs, I was expecting something derivative and poor when I curiously went to see it.  Instead, I was riveted, amused, and left quite shaken by the experience &quot;Fight Club&quot; unleashed upon me--so much so I saw it two more times in the theaters before it was unfairly scuttled into limbo.  David Fincher is simply the most exciting, risk-taking director working in mainstream Hollywood, and it really surprises me that a major studio was willing to shell out big bucks on a project this risky.  Unfortunately, a lot of people didn't see the same movie I did, which caused a short theatrical run.<br />Brad Pitt and Edward Norton make an incredible team here, and it's good to see Helena Bonham Carter playing a characer without an English accent.<br />The way the movie indicts materialism as a form of security and satisfaction is a statement more true than many figures in Hollywood are willing to accept, no doubt.  Norton's anonymous everyman is easily accessible for comparison with ourselves, and his deadpan narration perfectly encompasses his losing fight with the modern world as his sanity drifts.  Pitt's Tyler Durden is an all-id misfit that's really the highlight of this &quot;pretty boy's&quot; career, because the character runs against his image.<br />The filmmaking technique is dazzling despite its considerable grunge (a Fincher trademark).  A lot of scenes are carried out with incredible innovation and originality in &quot;Fight Club&quot; (Norton's direct-to-camera explanations, wobbling film stock, subliminal images, etc.) as opposed to a normal Hollywood film that would merely do something in a derivative way to get it over with.<br />All in all, if you allow &quot;Fight Club&quot; to suck you in, you'll go away from the movie shaken, high, and absolutely exhilarated.  Personally, I'm all for a theatrical revival.
0812589041|1.0|This is not the worst book ever written, but how Amazon can put this in its best SF of the Twentieth Century is quite beyond me. To me, this is what gives SF a bad name: juvenile militaristic rubbish with religous propagandist underpinnings; stereotypes instead of characters, a by-numbers plot; no depth, no complexity, no intelligence. I read this first when I was a teenager and thought it was bad then. I'm afraid it hasn't improved with age.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|Fiona Apple has got to be one of the most original artists making music today. Her voice and musical talents combine to give the listener a spine tingling head rush. This is good music, in a class with Steive Wonder. Unlike Portis Head who after a stunning first album came back with the same album Fiona's second album is on a par, if not better than her first. The styles are also very different with the second album being more drum and bassy/Jazzy than the first. All in all these are good tunes to drive to/dream through and not being to crude but to make love to. So get a copy and enjoy!
B00004YX39|5.0|Danfans rejoice!!  The remastered version of Steely Dan's final album for MCA has finally been released, more than a year after the reissue of &quot;Aja&quot;. In the liner notes Becker and Fagen make light of the lengthy delay of this re-release. From the accidental erasing of one of the songs slated for the album(The Second Arrangement) to Walter Becker being hit by a car, and the two plus years spent in the studio making this record, this obviously was a trying time for Messrs. Becker and Fagen, but the strain doesn't show. For years &quot;Gaucho&quot; has been unfairly compared to their previous album(which is a masterpiece, but we don't need to get into that now), this album is just as strong and stands very well on its own. Great songs like &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot;, &quot;Time Out Of Mind&quot;, and &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot; are classics that have held up well and will sound great years beyond now. An excellent first class reissue.

0679879269|5.0|This book was the most beautiful, the most powerful, and the saddest that I have ever read in my 12 years of life. There is none to equal it, or even rival it. If I ever find one, I'll tell you, but I doubt I will.  Love has been portrayed a thousand times before in films, art, and the written word, but never has it been portrayed more truthfully or more powerfull than in this book. Lyra's love for Will is the element which is the most beautiul; it is tangible and impenetrable; it is truth itself. Its portrayal brought me to tears. Lord Asriel and Mrs. Coulter are two of the most confusing characters in not only this book, but in the whole series. I myself have felt the sensation of wishing to hug them and strangle them at the same time. They have both been portrayed as cruel and perhaps sinister in both the previous books of the &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; trilogy, but now, in this final installment, after all their years of cruelty and indifference to Lyra, their final act is to die for their daughter. When I first discovered that there were only to be 3 books in the series, I moaned and resolved to write to Mr. Pullman and beg for just one more when I finished the third. But now I realize the series is complete; there is no more to tell. The story of Lyra and Will is not over, but it is at a close.  I finished this tapestry of beauty and sadness two days ago and still it has me in its grasp. I really have tried to start other books, but I have thrown them away from me in disgust. I can't seem to stop making comparisons to &quot;The Amber Spyglass.&quot; It seems that its glamor was too deep for me to ever be happy with any other book ever again.  I used to believe that &quot;The Golden Compass&quot; would never be rivaled. I was a mile from the mark; &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; surpasses any other printed text in this or any other country in the world.  I hold this book close to my heart and look to the sky and think, &quot;Perhaps I myself can travel to another world and do great deeds.&quot; But for now, I have &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; to sing to my heart while I wait for the northern lights to open a passage in the sky.
B000021XS0|5.0|Since my father introduced me to Emerson, Lake and Palmer in 1995, I have been a rabid fan and defender of progressive music, from Genesis and Santana (albums like Borboletta and Welcome) to ELP and Yes.  However I was disappointed that all the music I loved was made in the 70's (except for maybe Queen, which isn't really progressive). It wasn't until a friend introduced me to this album that I found something I loved that was made in the 90's.  &quot;Scenes&quot; just blew me away from the very first time I heard it.  My first and lasting impression was that DT had engineered a new sound.  Something like combining Led Zeppelin's skill and fury with Patrick Moraz's keyboards and style.  If you like Progressive Rock, in my opinion rock's true artistic vein, then this album is definitely for you.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|After reuniting with singer Bruce Dickinson, and guitarist Adrian Smith, and after 1999's extremely successful &quot;Ed Hunter&quot; tour, Iron Maiden returned to the studio to record their first album with their new lineup now consisting six members.  Because Bruce and Adrian were a part of the band during Maiden's peak, expectations were high for the new album, and some people wondered if Maiden was going to be able to make a record capable of filling those high expectations.  &quot;Brave New World&quot; surpasses all expectations!  &quot;Brave New World&quot; is easily Maiden's best release since &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; in '88.  From the opening track &quot;The Wickerman&quot;, it is clear that Maiden is serious and focused about climbing thier way back to number one.  Songs like &quot;The Wickerman&quot;, &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot;, &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, and &quot;Ghost of the Navigator&quot; are all hard rocking metal songs that force you to pump your fist in the air and shout along.  Every song is well written and VERY catchy. &quot;Brave New World&quot;, like &quot;Seventh Son...&quot; and like &quot;Powerslave&quot;, is one of those albums that contains no filler.  There are no tracks on the record that you will want to skip, EVERYTHING is great!  &quot;Brave New World&quot; is probably the best album I have heard in several years, and ranks amoung the top 3 best Maiden album ever in my book. This is REAL metal for those of you who think that Limp Bizcrap and that poser Kid Rock are metal.  While all of those &quot;(c)rap/metal&quot; bands are tuning their instuments down low and using turntables and effects to try and make up for their lack of talent, Iron Maiden display their amazing talent on this amazing record with great lyrics, catchy songs, lots of melody, fast solos, and an amazing singer. With this album, Maiden proves that  they are still the best metal band in the world and they show us that there is still exciting music out there.  But don't just take my word for it.  Look at the number of reviews for this album, and note that this record still holds almost a perfect five stars. There is well over 200 reviews and the average rating is almost a perfect five.  Ignore the two or three people that are bringing the average down. If you don't own this album yet, get it.  It's a must have. Believe me, the album is really that great.  UP THE IRONS!!!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|The only reason it took me 15 years to purchase this album was the overplayed radio-video killed Money for Nothing and Walk of Life. Yet, my curiosity finally took over in the new millennium about the rest of the tracks the group had to offer. ASTONISHING ! I had feared that maybe DS would have succumbed to the marketing-synthesized pressures of the 80's ( however,they didn't sing Money For Nothing for nothing).It's nothing but good 'ol Rock n' Roll without the glitz or glam of the 80's marketing monster. Kudos to Mark Knopfler for also writing Tina Turner's Private Dancer track back in '84...<br />Ride Across the River is memorable and some of pop music's writing at it's best !One World has a distinctive yet eclectic style.Knopfler's no thrills, frills vocal ability is right on target. <br />This entire project still holds up (even by today's standards) since DS did not take the new-wave synth pop sound route of the 80's; That path would have definitley dated the sound of the album entirely. After all DS was (is) about music (particularly Rock with a slight edge of blues-grass).
0684853523|5.0|I've been a Stephen King reader for more than half my life now.  When I was eleven, I bought Pet Sematary at the local grocery store paperback rack.  I'd never read an adult book before, but something about the book's spooky cover made me know I had to have it.  As it turned out, what was inside the book was even better.<br />What was inside was something that stirred and awakened my imagination.  Right at the beginning of puberty (I finished that book on my twelfth birthday) I fell in love with reading.  I'm 27 now, and my relationship with reading shows no signs of breaking off.  It's been fifteen years, and I still can't get enough. Reading will always be an important part of my life.  It's such a personal, even spiritual activity.  While reading, you can get to places in yourself that you never knew existed until you read that specific ordering of words on the page.  For a second your breath is taken from you and you feel a wonderful magnetic rush of recognition as your soul leaps up to meet the words somewhere in an imagined, but very real just-created space.  That's what great writing has the power to do, and that's why there's nothing quite like it in the world.  It's like dreaming with your eyes open.<br />Stephen King's new book, On Writing, is part autobiography and part how-to manual for aspiring writers.  I think that just about anyone who truly loves to read has the lurking desire to write.  That's my feeling, anyway.  I don't know how you couldn't want to do it.  I've wanted to be a writer pretty much all of my life.  So far, a lack of confidence and an overly critical inner voice have pretty effectively kept me from doing the one thing I know I really want to do.  It's my own fault that I haven't written more than I have, but I also think that I have the power within myself to turn that around.<br />Reading Stephen King's new book, I found myself truly inspired to give writing another try.  In the autobiographical sections of the book, King recounts formative events from his often difficult childhood and early adulthood.  His family was dirt-poor and he often had to work long hours at miserable jobs to help support his single mother.  Instead of letting those aspects of life beat him down, he was able to mine them for material for his writing.  In reading this section of the book, one gets a great feeling of the redemptive power of the creative imagination.<br />The writing portion, like the autobiographical one, is not exhaustive.  King touches on a few main points that are important to him.  Mainly that you have to love to read and love to read a lot in order to be a writer.  Because it's that force of loving the thing that's going to get you to where you want to be.  If that engine of wonder and fascination is not going full-tilt, you're not going to go anywhere.  That's why you can't be ashamed of what you like.  You've got to bathe in it, day after day.  If you like mysteries, read myesteries.  If it's westerns or romances, read westerns or romances.  You can't worry about what other people are going to think about what you're reading. &quot;Oh, he's got a soft mind&quot; or  &quot;She doesn't read anything important.&quot; When you let yourself listen to those voices, which I've done for too much of my life, you cut yourself off from the intuitive center of your being.  Then you just spin around in frustrating circles, chasing your tail instead of living life the way you want to.  If you love to read Shakespeare, by all means read Shakespeare, but do it because you love it, not because you want to be impress anyone.  I'm just starting to be able to do that now.<br />Anyway, I thought this was a truly wonderful little book.  It's not perfect, it doesn't come near saying all there is to say on the subject of writing--I don't think a thousand volumes could do that--and it's at times pretty opinionated, but it does inspire and it's very honest and to the point.  If you've ever had the yearning to write but felt you lacked some essential ability, do yourself a big favor and get this book.  From one aspiring writer to another, good reading, good writing, and good luck.t you lacked some essential ability, do yourself a big favor and get this book.  From one aspiring writer to another, good reading, good writing, and good luck.
B00004Y9PP|5.0|Pitch Black may borrow from several Sci-Fi flicks; at least all the flicks were honorably favorable ones like Aliens,Road Warrior, Dune, etc.  The original creativity and imagination from the writer for this story,including aliens that will only come out in the dark or night, added to the thrill and horror of what these creatures could do. At least the creatures were given a &quot;weakness&quot; unlike other films where the creepy things are indestructible. Expose these puppies to sunlight and P-O-O-F !...The same thing that happens to Gremlins and vampires in the sun w/o sunblock spf 2000.<br />Vin Diesel is also another actor to watch out for as he may be the next big box office success. Right now he's a little rough around the acting edges. Yet, he's defintiely destined for greater things! As for Radha Mitchell, she portrayed her character very humanly; she proved her character was fallible and human just like the others despite her rank or authority.<br />The f/x were also reminiscent of Starship Troopers; which is a compliment and not an insult. The only annoying eye strain-excercise is the beginning of the film where the crew is new to the planet's surface;The bluish-white filter camera effect was unbearable ! <br />This is a defintie Sci-Fi must see !
1559408855|5.0|Though still banned in my native England, tonight I finally got to see &quot;Salo&quot; after 25 years of hearing its fearful and mis-represented reputation. Reading through the reviews on the IMD and here on the Amazon site, it seems clear that for many it is a &quot;Must See  Nasty&quot; - A film whose graphic imagery of torture, rape, coprophilia, sexual perversion and murder become an endurance test to rate alongside &quot;I Spit On Your Grave&quot; or &quot;Last House On The Left&quot;. The truth is that on a purely visually graphic level, it's violence and rape is outdone by 1000 other films. But the emotional and mental impact of the film, it's messages and what it tells us of Man's inhumanity is practically unrivalled. It's hard to express the film's strength and message without lapsing into pseudo-psychobabble, and the layers of meaning and allegory contained within it are too various to list, but to try to put it simply, by using the extremity of deSade and the awful truth of Fascism in Europe, Pasolini confronts the beast in us all. Having lived in Italy during the time of Mussolini, Pasolini saw at first hand the distortion and debasemant of humanity under Fascism. DeSade in turn, celbrated the fact that man's capacity for atrocity was what made us human and could free us - two sides of one awful coin. Many of the scenes have an awful stillness, presented as full-frame tableaux, with the four main protagonists watching the degradations: Pasolini flips this back on us sat in a movie theatre watching the film... For anyone seeking to ask questions about whether or not Fascism, nazism or pure evil still has the capacity to re-occur, and particularly for those people who pretend &quot;it could never happen here again&quot;, this is the film to confront them with. It is a multi layered, disturbing, often strangely beautiful film and one that any real fan of cinema should see, to fully experience the power of film to provoke, stimulate and force the viewer into confronting real, painful aspects of humanity. Sorry to get arty, but this film has had more impact on me than practically any film I have seen in the past 20 years. A masterpiece, for real. With recent events in Eastern Europe still fresh in the mind, this film and what it has to say about Human Beings is especially relevant.
B000002GF8|1.0|I did not care for Synchronicity and I gave it away. EBYT -The Singles was better.
B00004YKUX|5.0|If you're expecting the younger bravado of hits like 'Ring of Fire' and 'I Walk the Line,' prepare to be treated to something better. The man has walked the long hard road and arrived at that point where his soul is showing. The bass voice is intact. The timbre is improved with age... and the meaning that is poured into the music is magnified by the fact that all of us are older now. The range in this recording strikes me as wider than usual. Not just a mixture of old and new country, but a blend of this and that.  Listen to this one as background music first. Then sit down and really listen. All this one lacks is a reprise of 'One Piece at a Time' for its humor, but I won't complain. Thank you, Mr. Cash!
0385495323|5.0|The Code Book traces the evolution of secret messages from simple hidden messages to modern computer/mathematical cipher techniques.  Using interesting historical examples of different cipher techniques, Singh explores not only the cipher techniques but also the people that developed them or succeeded in making contributions to breaking them. There are certainly some fascinating characters!  The secretive nature of the work consigned them to the shadowy peripherals of history, undermining the importance of their work. The decipherment of Linear B was an incredible achievement and the success and importance of breaking Enigma can not be understated.<br />Singh does a remarkable job at making such a complex topic relevant, interesting and fairly easy to understand. I definetly learned a lot reading this book and enjoyed myself thoroughly while doing so.  Read it before buying your other books online!
B00004U8H4|3.0|Wow! I just finished the movie and I have to say it was very timid. It is NOTHING like the book! The story is fundamentaly the same, but the death scenes in the movie are both fewer and lighter in terms of gore. My God, the book made me want to vomit, and I've read some messed up stuff in my time. See the movie, then read the horrifying book and compare.
B00004U30D|1.0|This movie is so hateful, so loatheful of human existence that it's the most painful experience. The writer obviously hates women because The Annette Bening is such a stereotypical picture of women. She should wear a sign that says, &quot;What she needs is a really good shag.&quot; That's about as subtle as the writer is with her character. Kevin Spacey again shows why he is the worst respected actor working today. It's the same performance he has given in every one of his movies. This guy's act never changes. Skip this overbloated piece of manure.
B000002JS6|4.0|This is the album that launched AC/DC into mainstream success. &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; got em started, but this has all their big hits. It brought us songs like &quot;Hell's Bells&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot;, and the title track, all of which are great. There's nothing overly brilliant about this album, the music is not especially technical (although Angus does come up with a good solo now and then), the lyrics are pretty meaningless, and there's no melody at all, and yet there is something strangely irresistible about it. It's good to move around to, and it just fills you with energy. A little bit of melody would be nice, though, all the hard rock legends have melody in their music (Zeppelin, Sabbath, Aerosmith). But, oh well. Although I prefer &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; (the only other AC/DC album I have), and it's not the best album of 1980 (that would be Ozzy's &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot;, followed closely by Black Sabbath's &quot;Heaven and Hell&quot;), &quot;Back in Black&quot; is still a sure thing for those who like their music heavy.
B00003CXFG|4.0|This is a good movie, really. The plot line wont blow you away, but this movie isn't reall all about the plot anyways. The visuals are top notch and the acting is decent enought to pass. The plot itself is predictable as most of your other summer blockbusters, so don't expect a sweeping epic, just a movie that will keep you entertained for a good 2 hours. As for the DVD, there are decent features, but nothing outstanding. The package stated that this is the unrated directors cut, but I really don't see what it is that they could have added that is so mind boggling. Never the less, rent it and you'll probably enjoy it.
0380788624|5.0|Okay.  First a bit about me... I am a programmer with some interest in computer security, and I have been fascinated by the Enigma and WWII spying in general.  I was a math major in college, and I enjoy a lot of technical stuff. I also know a little Japanese so I even caught some of the Japanese puns in this book.<br />So basically, I am the quintessential nerd -- the type of guy who could empty a cocktail party faster than a bomb scare.  I'm like Dilbert, only not as good looking.   That said, I would still recommend this book to normal people.  It has a very good storyline (actually two simultaneous storylines almost 50 years apart), interesting characters, and relationships and details that tie together in fascinating ways.<br />A friend of mine who is an actress (in L.A. even nerds know actresses), said that she thought this book would be a bore but once she got started, was drawn in.
B00004XOWM|5.0|The new Limp Bizkit CD is a great follower to Significant Other.  After owning it for 5 days, and knowing the words to a few of the songs already, I can say it's definitely worth having.  Go out and buy it NOW!  Thank you Fred, Wes, Sam, John and DJ Lethal, for making my drive to work more enjoyable.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Nothing to say about this incredible recording that the other reviewers haven't already written, except that as my title suggests, it should be American IV.  Following the release of Unchained, there was an European release titled American Outtakes, 17 other songs, mostly covers, that Rick Rubin recorded of Johnny and his guitar during the sessions that produced American Recordings. These songs didn't make the final shakedown, though they are of the same quality. I managed to buy a copy of the disc from a small store in the US, and beyond that know nothing about how it came to be released in such limited quantity. Will say that everyone who has written about American III, and everyone who appreciates the American Trilogy, should keep their ear to the ground, and do whatever anyone can think of doing to encurage a wider release of this lost treasure.
0399146253|5.0|What a great book!  Once I got started, I didn't look up again for the next ten hours.  Patricia Cornwell has a talent for drawing you in to Dr. Scarpetta's life.  You feel like you really know all of these characters.  The only recommendation that I would make to someone contemplating buying this book, is to read Point of Origin and Black Notice first. The Last Precinct is a continuation of those two books.  Believe me, you will not be disappointed with any of them!
6304602901|1.0|why did you even bother coming down to here? You are either looking for someone to have a laugh at if they rate it so highly when their insane or youre looking for someone to give it a proper report like im doing. This film is abliteratingly poor do not buy it's out the ark and its not even worth what its worth.   gooday  to you all.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I love the fact that when she says it's gonna be R&amp;B, it's R&amp;B!  She shows a lot of growth on this album, which is more than I can say for another artist.  Keep up the great work Christina and I hope this is shades of what's to come on your follow-up album!
0340738448|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, and incidentally, my favorite screenplay! It's an excellent representation of the movie--many full-color pictures of the best scenes in the movie. It even includes story boards, cast and unit lists, and an afterword by Hugh Grant. The photographs were taken by Clive Coote, one of Great Britain's most famous photographers.<br />Almost everything I'd seen before I bought the book only included pictures of Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant--this book is different! It doesn't leave out Spike or any of the other small but memorable characters.<br />Anyone who's a fan of the movie will love this exquisite book. It gets an A+ from me!
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park has to be one of the best bands in this genre of music in a while.  With hard pounding riffs, amazing back DJ beats and lyrics that actually mean something this band will go places!  Pick up their debut release on Warner Brothers and see for your self; then go check them out on tour with Hed Planet Earth and P.O.D.  This CD is my current fav, and is worth every single penny.  Hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
0671042858|4.0|This book was as I said in the title not typical King but not all that bad. The only thing that really bothered me with this book is the lack of dialogue and writing that would hold the reader throughout the whole book.<br /> The book is about young Trisha McFarland that gets lost in the woods fromher mother and brother. Bascially the book is a story of self survival and she does this by imagining that Tom Gordon, the relief pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is with her. Using this and her radio, she finds the strength inside of her to go on. She finally makes it and has a final showdown with the &quot;thing&quot; that was scaring her.<br /> Although not horrible I wouldn't recommend it over any other King book.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I love this cd! Its very nice and its the kind of tunes that make you want to bop to the music. The songs are simmilar to those in Celene Dion's &quot;These Are The Special Times&quot; so if you like that one definitely consider this one! I always find it better to purchase a Christmas cd before the holiday as supposed to getting it for Christmas because then you'll be in the holiday spirit beforehand! This cd is also good to listen to even after Christmas and into January and Febrary because it is still dealing with winter. It has been just released, so consider it!
0684853523|5.0|After the horrible Danse Macabre I never would have thought that King would make another attempt at non-fiction. In this attempt he strikes well and this book was great! The book basically has two parts, the first an autiobiography, and the second a writing guide which really helped me. <br /> The first part of the book I feel was put in as a sort of inspiration. I must say his life was truly weird and also very cool. From the days when he was a tot to the days when he got married this section houses all of that wondeful information.<br /> The second part, the writing guide, is truly great as it teaches things you would never learn in school. It shows how to draft your books, how to choose a topic, and how to use the right words and grammar. I feel this part of the book must be read even if you are not an author or writer. <br /> Lastly Mr. King throws in a brief summary of the events that happened in the summer of 1999. So this book is not to be missed for any King fan. If you are not a fan don't waste your time and money.
0440539811|5.0|Well, how to even BEGIN to describe this book?  Other people have done it so much better than I ever will, and so I must be humble here folks - I can't.<br />What I can do is tell you a little about me; before and after I read this book.<br />Let me share with you what I knew before I read this book:<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />I knew EVERYTHING, in great detail, in chronological order, with footnotes, dates, times, witnesses, alibies, all approved by law, bound by the church and stamped by the notary public.<br />Now, let me share with you what I know since reading this book:<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />&lt;insert blank, non-colored, non-existant &quot;page&quot; as a thought and uncomfortably long pause here&gt;<br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Any questions?<br />This book changed my life in ways I never knew it could change.<br />It shook my death grip upon the pillars of my so-called sanity loose and taught me a little bit about being more comfortable with myself, with acceptance, with tolerance, with sobriety, with religion, with spirituality, with consciousness, with unconsciousness, with love, with lust, with politics, drugs, sex, with cults, with fraternal organizations and all the other dirty subjects that people seem to &quot;know&quot; so much about around here.<br />The guerilla ontology portions alone challenged me and my so-called 'beliefs' so often, and so repeatedly, and I was constantly asked &quot;is that your final answer?&quot; so many times (and you think Regis is annoying!) that there is no way to hang onto those 'reality-tunnels' anymore.  It's futile,  Let go.<br />Some people might prefer &quot;The Language of Letting Go&quot; or &quot;The Road Less Travelled&quot; or some Depak Chopra, or Florence Scoval Schinn, but I prefer &quot;The Illuminatus Trilogy.&quot;<br />Maybe that says something about who I am, but that's all right by me because I'm no longer who I was.
0316777722|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much and (after hearing excerps) my 15 year old son was chomping at the bit to have it.  It is a very funny book.  And I am not one of those people who think everything is funny.  I am quite picky.  The author lets you know that he is gay in the most natural way and that was nice, too.  I loved the endearing way that he wrote about his quirky family. (By the way, my 15 year old loved it, too.)
076790382X|3.0|I came across a used copy of &quot;Notes from a Big Country&quot; which was the title for this work when it was published for British readers.  Like other Bryson's works, it has a considerable degree of charm, wit, some sting, and more than a little bit of truth.  American readers will understand and relate to Bryson's experiences and frustrations as an ex-patriot returning home.<br />As with other Bryson books, however, after awhile you want to say &quot;lighten up Bill&quot;.  He even shares that his English born wife responded when reading a draft for one of the articles included in this collection &quot;bitch, bitch, bitch&quot;.  After awhile you do recognize that Bryson was providing what his British audience sought -- pokes and taunts validating their sense of the inadequacy of the United States.  Since Bryson is an Anglophile his comparisons of American and British culture and society are from the perspective that the latter is decidedly superior.<br />While Bryson's criticisms and frustrations are well founded, they would be more palatable if balanced with some favorable observations. While he does share the warmth, generosity and security of his New England community, he then qualifies this segment by noting that a New York transplant advised him &quot;this isn't the real world, its New Hampshire&quot;. While all Americans are not all dull, dim witted sheep who prefer a junk food diet and who are too apathetic to resist unthinking bureaucracy this book leaves one with the impression that this largely Bryson's opinion.<br />While this book isn't entirely negative, one is reminded that humor is well intended when you are laughing &quot;with someone&quot;.  Since this collection, like other Bryson books, primarily laughs &quot;at&quot; the United States you are left with the question &quot;why did Bryson choose to return?&quot;

B000002BQK|5.0|While Mariah's Music Box will probably go down as her classic album (and rightly so), Butterfly reveals the depth and versatility which Mariah can aspire to with success.  Butterfly, her emancipation album from her failed marriage to Tommy Mottola is a pained but smooth soul/r'n'b/hiphop affair.<br />The album's title track steals the show with its soaring chorus and aching lyrics of release, while Whenever You Call continues the refrain of being with a loved one who is no linger there.  Prince collaboration Beautiful Ones is sexy &amp; Honey drips sex appeal.  The Roof and Breakdown show La Mariah has cred &amp; the gorgeous No1 My All is worth buying the album for alone, where Msriah wishes for the return of a lost love.  The album is very much themed about loss, but Mariah finds, upon singing so, true identity and solace in a musical package which is breathtaking, consistent &amp; a joy for any music listenr if they like opo/soul/r'n'b/dance.
B00004XOWM|3.0|but the problem i have with this recording is there is nothing on it that wasn't already on significant other.  it's just basically the same and doesn't sound new.  the lyrics are stupid.
0671034065|5.0|I was hesitant to read this since the preview in the back of the previous book introduced characters that were not very likeable but once I started reading the book I sure changed my mind.  I laughed, I cried and my heart pounded. The story is exciting and very suspenseful.  What a great read!  Buy it! Buy it! Buy it! You will love the characters!  I did not want to see the story end.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This movie chronicals the real life of John Merrick, or the Elephant Man as he was refered to.  Raised or discovered by a circus man, Merrick traveled 19th century England as a freak, where his incredible deformation and disfiguration brought about the curiousity of a doctor(Anthony Hopkins).  The doctor discoves although he has been treated like an animal, Merrick is actually intelligent and articulate.  He introduces him to British society and becomes his friend. The trials and tribulations of this story are what ensue. This is an amazing movie.  David Lynch is at his directorial best  creating a tale of simpathy, facination, gratification, cruelty, and redeption.  John Hurt is brilliant as Merrick giving layer after layer to such a complex character.  The make up artists also did a terrific job transforming Hurt into Merrick.  This film is a classic and anyone who loves movies should see it.  I highly recommend it.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|THis is a great collection in comparison to others that are released.  If you are a longtime Lenny fan, there are a few notable ommissions i.e. Rosemary, Fields of Joy etc.  The decision to include the last track is strange because it really is not consistent with his entire workings.  If you are just a recent admirer of Lenny, this collection is right up your alley.  Kudos for the inclusion of Mr Cab Driver.
6304698623|5.0|A client of mine turned me onto this film, and I think it's one of the most beautifully photographed films I've ever seen.  The DVD package is simple, no booklet, no disc graphic, but I wasn't expecting to be blown away with a bunch of extras, although a couple of extras would have been nice.  The disc comes in widescreen and full screen versions, as well as 3 trailers.  So, I put the disc into my machine and enjoyed this beautiful film.  The sound was remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1, and although this is not your shoot-em-up, explosive film that really takes advantage of 5.1, this film uses its surround elements quite nicely.  Sometimes the vocals sound a little too tinny (too much treble), but overal the stereo separation and ambiance is soothing and pleasant.  Picture quality is beautiful, with very rich color saturation and fine detail throughout the disc.  This really is a beautiful looking film, and the DVD format  unlocks the beautiful colors quite impressively.  I recommend this film for those who appreciate beautiful cinematography, and for those in the mood for a non-violent family picture.  If any Dads are reading this, and you have a young daughter (probably 8-12 years of age), she'll thank you for treating her to such a pleasant movie experience.  Enjoy!
0440224764|4.0|Four and a half years before and a lifetime ago, Patrick Lanigan faked his own death, embezzled US$90M from the law firm where he was a partner, and disappeared from sight, leaving behind his wife and baby daughter.<br />When he was caught and brought back, many charges were brought against him, by the Federal government, by the State government, by his own wife, by his former firm, by the insurance companies, especially by those who lost the money.  They range from murder to abandonment, to fraud, everyone wants a piece of Patrick Lanigan and it seems that there's not enough of him to satisfy all.<br />But Patrick had yet to play all his cards.  He has a beautiful and smart partner out there coordinating with him, using the US$90M as a powerful tool.  Despite his infamy, he still has friends in the legal circles, sympathetic and willing to help.  However, his most powerful weapon it seems is the truth itself, which he deployed to unravel everything that stood against him.<br />It was interesting how much court room scene actually turned out in the face of all the legal actions flying around.  Despite the atrocities charged to Patrick, the author made it clear that he is a figure to root for, hence readers could expect from the beginning that Patrick was not a monster.  Thus it was not surprise that revelations and twists came to save him, only the nature of those twists.<br />Despite the seemingly brilliant plan Patrick had to save himself, thoughtful readers would notice several large holes in Patrick's plan - namely, the one thing he had failed to plan for in the event of his capture turned out to be one of his most important salvation.
B00000ILDE|4.0|As a fan of James Cameron, I was excited to buy this THX certified DVD and pop it into my player as soon as it arrived.  Upon opening this DVD package, I first noticed the rather lazy disc design and booklet.  I think the booklet can use a facelift with much more behind-the-scenes info rather then a resume on all the actors.  When I buy a &quot;Special Edition&quot;, I expect more then that.  Call me crazy, but I want every aspect of the package to be 'special' if you are going to label a DVD package as a &quot;Special Edition&quot;.  But maybe I'm being picky......maybe not.  So anyway, I popped the disc into my player and enjoyed the menu graphics....simple, yet attractive with easy navigation.  I started to play the movie and was instantly impressed by the sound quality.  I knew I was in for a treat.  The picture looked terrific, with rich blacks and saturated colors.  Fine detail and a clean transfer made this film a pleasure to watch.  I hope all films are transferred from High Definition masters in the future....it really is a noticeable difference.  The sound quality throughout the film was explosive.  The surround elements are wonderful and the stereo separation is quite pleasing and realistic.  There are many scenes where the bass will test your system, so be prepared for your ears to bleed a little bit.  Although the vocals on the actors sound just a tad dated (a little flat in some areas), overall, this DVD sounds quite impressive.  Having THX certification is almost a sure guarantee that your audio experience will be the best it can be.  The disc also includes the usual stuff.....trailers, scene selecion.....but the addition of 17 minutes of restored footage is the real reason I bought this disc.  The scenes fit flawlessly into the original cut, and if you are like me, you'll appreciate trying to recognize the scenes and enjoying the restored footage.  I can see why they were originally cut, not being THAT important or necessary to the flow of the film,but having them included did not ruin the experience for me....I found the scenes quite enjoyable.  In conclusion, I recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of the Alien series (except for Alien 3) and/or a fan of James Cameron.  The original was wonderful, but as usual, James Camerons need to thrill us all comes through loud and clear in this sequel.  Although I do recommend a better job creating the booklet and the disc graphic in this &quot;Special Edition&quot;, every other aspect of this DVD is wonderful.  Enjoy!
014028009X|4.0|Number of times have called friends to tell about book 14 (not enough), number of times laughed out loud in public while reading 365 (or more...), number of times have wanted to count weight in stones and marry Mr Darcy: too many, number of emails and messages written Bridget's diary style ALL (yes, annoyed friends) <br /> Bridget Jones is a single woman in her thirties, and as Jane Austen might have said it: &quot;It is a fact universally acknowledge that a single woman in her thirties must be unable to find a partner&quot;. Thus, her entire family and friends' life goal is to hear Bridget out about any current boyfriends or try to hook her up with someone, anyone. Bridget herself is very much convinced it must be her weight that is keeping her from finding anyone. <br /> This very funny diary might remind one a bit of the Adrian Mole diaries, that were written in a similar way and had a main character that dealt with many of the same problems. However, Bridget Jones's diary has more to it than just the every day life of a very funny/desperate woman, it is also a modern day version of Pride &amp; Prejudice, obviously written with the same characters in mind. Bridget being Elisabeth, Mark Darcy being of course Mr. Darcy! If you have seen the 6 hour BBC version of Pride &amp; Prejudice, or have read the actual book by Jane Austen (both are absolutely fabulous and extremely funny, particularly the BBC series, because they star the V. handsome Colin Firh as Darcy), you will have the additional fun of slowly realizing who is who in the book (I won't give it away, it is much more fun to find this out by yourself), and also you will find that Mr. Darcy was written with Colin Firth (who will in fact play Mark Darcy in the upcoming movie) in mind.<br /> If you have not seen or read Pride &amp; Prejudice, this book will still be a great read. Any woman who's ever had a relationship, wanted to lose weight, or even had a mother, will identify with Bridget, as she goes throughmany entertaining crises's and introduces her friends and her not-so-wonderful boyfriend Daniel. Enter Bridget's life for a year (or more, the sequal is already out), you won't be able to put the book down! Don't wait for the movie to come out, the book is fab, funny and a pleasant read.
B000025558|5.0|Upon my first listen, I was not too fond of this album.  The more I listen to it, the more I fall in love with it.  The melodies are unlike anything out on the market right now.  The songs will grow on you after a while, especially &quot;Everything In Its Right Place&quot; and &quot;The National Anthem.&quot; I would strongly recommend this album to any Radiohead fan or any music fan looking for something new and daring.  One more thing, the domestic version also comes with a special booklet under the CD tray.
6304698526|4.0|Bullitt is a rare and complex film; a strange mixture of European style &quot;cinema verite&quot; and glossy Hollywood stylisation. Sure, it has a car-chase, but its a shame that that monumental sequence tends to overwhelm everything else that's good in it.<br />The opening title sequence which flips from color to monochrome accompanied by a loud jazzy score, indicates nothing but a brash late 1960s stylish thriller. But what we get is a thoughtful sensitive character study of a laconic, yet complex man; Frank Bullitt, his arty sensitive English girlfriend, and the pressures his job in the San Fransico Homicide division impose.<br />Englishman Peter Yates started his career directing advertisments and short films; his aptitude for the perfectly crafted scene is never better than here. Most scenes are shot from a distance giving a deliberately cold amoral feel. Several, such as the meal in the jazz club (no dialogue), Bullitt's trip to the grocery store (two words of dialogue), and the muder discovery in the motel near San Mateo are about as perfect as cinema gets.<br />There's also a little remarked but very subtle mood change that occurs; at the beginning of the film we feel excited, almost exhilerated, by the end (the best closing shot you'll ever see?) the mood is sombre and serious.<br />If you have the attention span of a goldfish, like lots of action and plenty of dead bodies and explosions, then this film is not for you. <br />If instead you like to care about the people you watch, and want to appreciate virtuoso film making (has any thriller ever been better to look at?) then buy this DVD. You'll watch it many times, and find plenty to enjoy and ponder each time.<br />Highly recommended.
0552131067|5.0|My only problem with this book is that it is far too short.  I read it more and more and wish the story didn't end too soon.  The story draws you in, and all the characters are portrayed very well, leading to a very tense moment when Death starts, well, um...  Don't want to give away the plot.  Let's just say he's losing his voice, and that's a bad thing...  A GREAT book.
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A is an excellent CD.  Yes it is odd, but what do you expect from the band.  If you are new to Radiohead, this will take time to grow on you, but give it a chance you won't be disappointed.<br />For all their apparent success Radiohead still seems to be a &quot;tweener&quot;.  They're not so obscure that only people named Malcolm have heard of them and yet still are not played as much (except when they come to town) as many other bands.
B00003CXCS|5.0|&quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is a delight from beginning to end, and the DVD adds exceptional features and content that really round out the filmgoing experience.<br />What review of this film would be complete without the requisite gushing praise for the opening sequence? It's justifiably famous, and gives an epic feel to a film that, at its heart, is a simple family story. <br />Director Robert Wise lives up to his surname...he wisely takes a very effective minimalist approach with the story. Where a lesser director would have 'pumped up' the song sequences with flashier camera moves, Wise lets the songs speak for themselves and instead concentrates on getting the texture and feel of the scenes just right. &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; is simply but beautifully shot.<br />Julie Andrews is a delight as the plucky Maria, who starts as an erstwhile nun, becomes a governess, and earns the affections of the children of the steely Captain Von Trapp (Christopher Plummer, all poise and polish), not to mention the captain himself. The children are all properly cute and talented, and the supporting performances by Richard Haydn (the charming sponge Max Detweiler) and Eleanor Parker (Captain Von Trapp's would-be society fiancee) hit all the right notes.<br />If the film has a weakness, it's length; &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; weighs in at almost three hours, which is quite a stretch by today's standards. But in the original theatrical version, there was an intermission, which was common practice for long films in those days.<br />There are also times that Wise plays it a bit too minimalistically, and the big finish should have more emotional punch than it does, but overall this film is an unqualified smash.<br />It's worth noting that at the time of its release, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; was wildly popular; in fact, adjusted for inflation, it's the third highest grossing film in history, behind only &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;.<br />Not bad company for this classic film. And the second DVD disc included with this set - packed with production notes, interviews and extra information - just makes this a better deal.<br />Enjoy!
B00004XOWM|1.0|What a complete load of rubbish... Limp Bizkit's third outing sees them trying even harder than the first two and failing even more. Modern radio should be ashamed at the way that it is encouraging bands like this. There was once a time when the &quot;superstar&quot; bands were there because they genuinely deserved it. Bands like the Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, Nine Inch Nails and Alice in Chains got the spotlight because they genuinely deserved it... it's a travesty that manufactured tryhard bands like Limp Bizkit can achieve greater popularity than the little real talent that's still out there. Big ups to the major labels for flooding the market with rubbish like this, eh?
B00004XOWM|1.0|This CD is the worst thing I have heard in a long time.  I would give it zero stars if I could.  It makes Significant Other (another crappy CD) sound like a masterpiece.  Every song on here is worse then the one before it.  I think Fred Durst spent too much time trying to get on Christina Aguluiar (sic), when he should have spent time thinking up decent lyrics.  All the songs either sound like &quot;Nookie&quot; or &quot;Rearranged.&quot;  The one good thing about this CD is Wes Borland's guitar work.  He needs to leave the band. [...]  There is no way I would pay money for this
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina Aguilera's CD keep getting better.  I thought it would be hard to top Mi Reflejo, but My Kind of Christmas successfully does that and more.  The traditional christmas songs like &quot;Silent Night&quot; (and its Spanish version) are beautifully sung and given new meaning.  I especially like the first track, &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; with Dr. John because the voices just seem to mix like they were made for each other.  All-and-all there isn't a flaw with this CD that I can find and it really will be &quot;Your Kind of CD&quot;.  I'd recommend this to everyone.  If this is where Christina's CDs are headed, then I can't wait for her next English album.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening deliver performances in this film unsurpassed in their greatness.  Spacey plays a man caught in mid-life in a dead-end job who wants nothing more than for his life to be less monotonous. His wife, played beautifully by Annette Bening, is a housewife and mother who is almost entirely void of any excitement for her marriage, and also desperately needs a change of lifestyle. After Lester Burnham (Spacey) quits his job, he begins to go through a lot of changes in the way he views the world around him.<br />This movie is about love, hate, and confusion, and an absolute must-own for years and years, and a keeper for the rest of your life, as it is an instant classic.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|This CD is a great introduction to the world of Lenny Kravitz.  For those only familiar with his songs on the radio, this CD offers you a chance to hear a mini-history of his music.<br />If you are looking for something not too deep and a little funky, pick this one up.
B00004TFK3|4.0|&quot;Men In Black&quot; proceeds from the familiar premise that humans are one of many intelligent species in the universe, but adds a coy corollary: we ain't that bright a species.<br />Nevertheless, in the universe of &quot;Men In Black&quot;, Earth is a kind of DMZ for aliens looking for a trouble free existence, and the job of the Men In Black is to keep it trouble free. Tommy Lee Jones's character, Agent K, likens it to the exile world of &quot;Casablanca&quot;, and it's a apt comparison. But the worst problem facing the poor exiles of &quot;Casablanca&quot; was Louis Renault's arbitrary gendarme; certainly, giant intergalactic bugs that suck the guts out of humans and wear their skins as a disguise never made an appearance at Rick's Cafe Americain.<br />And where is this sci-fi &quot;Casablanca&quot;? New York, of course.<br />&quot;Men In Black&quot; veers wildly from sly comedy to slapstick and fairly standard sci-fi action. There are the requisite sci-fi trappings, like ray guns, flying saucers, a fancy high-tech headquarters, and cool gadgets. But &quot;Men In Black&quot; takes these kinds of sci-fi conventions and turns them on their ear; Agent J (Will Smith) is issued his ray gun sidearm, it's a tiny affair called the &quot;Noisy Cricket&quot;. But as it turns out, the Noisy Cricket is roughly as powerful as a rocket launcher. The Men In Black's requisite high tech headquarters doubles as a kind of intergalactic customs office where aliens man the communications console AND the coffee maker, and like to smoke Marlboros. <br />This sort of &quot;anything goes&quot; tone works well for &quot;Men In Black&quot;, at least for its first half. Agent K even instructs J in the fine art of finding aliens. Does he use some kind of super-advanced technology to do it? Nope. He reads the National Enquirer.<br />Jones is all seriousness as Agent K, a man who's literally been there and done that, and listened to Elvis while it was happening; Smith is at his streetwisebest as K's partner J, who has an affinity for chasing down aliens and smack talking 50-foot-high giant bugs that have 70 million children (as the bug stares J down, he crushes a cockroach and asks 'Was that your auntie?').<br />I won't even begin to describe the over-the-top plot, but suffice it to say that the film's villain (Vincent D'Onofrio) is an intergalactic bug who inhabits the skin of a redneck farmer (Vincent D'Onofrio) and isn't real fond of humans, especially ones that hurt bugs. <br />That kind of irreverent, 'anything goes' tone works well for &quot;Men In Black&quot;, but unfortunately, the movie bogs down when it goes for standard summer action fare about halfway through. It's also a shame that director Barry Sonnenfeld couldn't find more for the excellent Linda Fiorentino to do in this film.<br />Still, even when &quot;Men In Black&quot; resorts to standard action-flick conventions (the street chase, for example), the tongue-in-cheek attitude remains, and that's the film's biggest strength.<br />It bears noting that the DVD has any number of excellent features that make it a nice buy.
B00004Y7SF|3.0|I love Christina and was really expecting to see a steller Christmas album.  Too many uptempos, not enough good Christmas goodness. If you want a really excellent Christmas pop album buy Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas
B00004RF9B|5.0|What a truly remarkable film this is. It scared me as a child, made me ponder on philosophy as a youth, and help give me understanding as an adult. Great science fiction films like Forbidden Planet don't just give  a couple of hours of entertainment, but make us think deep thoughts. But for others like myself this film cuts too close to the bone.    Forget about blaming the world or circumstances for your ills or problems, for the rot truly lies within. Look at the soul destroying prognosis that the captain must force upon Morbius so as to reach the only possible conclusion, that the evil hideous monster that lures in the dark ripping his comrades limb from limb is actually HIM (Morbius) now ready to destroy the captain and his only daughter.    Technology is neither good nor evil just neutral but people in a fit of rage will still smash their TV's, stereos, microwaves, etc if it does not work as expected, when will we ever learn that circumstances just reveal who we truly are. Two thousand years ago a unique man walked the earth, he spoke remarkable words and  did brave things that lead up to his death but never backed down from what he said. One of these things was what Morbius needed to hear.    That man is basically evil in thoughts and deeds. But what God regards as evil intents and thoughts, man regards as natural and normal.    I have seen some classic horror films like all of the Alien films and in these films who are the real monsters as Aliens 4 shows so well, the aliens, or the humans who would use fellow humans as hosts so as to use them for the military or bred an entirely new species part human part alien. Remember the shock of Ripey's face when she entered the medical lab to see what they are really up too.    Thanks Forbidden Planet you have taught me a lot about myself....  Cheers.
0790740443|4.0|Soldier is an action sci-fi film. It is quite entertaining compared to many in the same genre and has more credibility compared to Universal Soldiers. First of all, unlike Van Damme, Russell can act. Secondly, the BS in the other film about dead soldiers walking about and being bullet proof is way too far-fetched. Soldier is also supported by a very good cast notably, Gary Busey, Connie Nielsen and Jason Scott Lee. Okay, the story is old and there's not a lot new but if you view it as just an action flick, you will enjoy it. See it and judge for yourself.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Having seen this one in the theater I thought Pitch Black took a familiar genre into a new direction. On DVD it scores even bigger.  David Twohy's script is very linear as far as plot goes but mangages originality within it. The ensemble cast make up an interesting group of survivors who actually serve to be the main driving force of the story. Despite the excellent special effects, especially the way cool opening crash sequence, the cool creatures, and a very cool visual style this story at its core is character driven drama which is rare enough in cinema let alone in a sci-fi Thriller.       Vin Diesel scores the most points with his character of Riddick. He, though a known killer, is more than he appears like many of the characters in the story. Diesel will hold your attention when he is on screen.      As far as the DVD features go they are average and I confess to not being able to tell what the difference is between the unrated version and the R-version. Still the picture is great with almost no noticeable imperfection and graininess only in the darkest scenes. The Dolby Digital 5.1 is crisp and well mixed throughout but best heard in the crash sequence. All in all a must have in any DVD collection for the Home Theater fan.
B00001NFCY|4.0|It is often tough to like a band that you enjoyed in their infancy once their music starts to mature.  Human Clay took a couple of playings before I was hooked.<br />When you first play the CD it will become obvious (if you have listened to &quot;My Own Prison&quot;) that the band has not only matured, but lightened up.  Gone are the darker brooding tunes from &quot;...Prison&quot;, replaced by a more positive, even hopeful message.  If you have the time and have both CD's play them back-to-back and you will see the change.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|There doesn't seem to be an end to the musical dexterity of Mr. Lenny Kravitz. He blends heavy guitar rock with traditional black soul so well, that sometimes it becomes difficult to classify his work. He always manages to silence his critics with one above-par album after the other. This best of...collection is just what a lot of his fans have been waiting for. You simply cannot beat the guitar work in songs like, \\"Are you gonna go my way\\", \\"American woman\\", and \\"Fly away\\". \\"It ain't over till its over\\", \\"Let love rule\\", and \\"Again\\", are also some of the songs constantly under the \\"Repeat\\" command on my CD player. This rocker soul brother is definitely gonna be up there for a long time. A definite must buy.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is without a doubt the best new band I've heard in a long time. I first heard of them months ago on that &quot;evil tool&quot; that begins with an N. I've been waiting for their debut ever since.Their debut CD &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is one of those rare instances where I can listen to every song without skipping any. All of the songs are that good. By now most people have heard their first single &quot;One Step Closer&quot; somewhere. If you were worried about that being the only good song on the CD, don't. In fact thats not even the best song (that honor goes to either Pushing Me Away or With You). So do yourself a favor and buy this CD now because once everyone hears of this band (and MTV gets their hooks in them and makes them trendy) the price is definitely gonna go up.
0399103422|5.0|_The Godfather_ is the novel who introduced me to the reading of Anglo-American books in the original language.<BR> For the first time, I felt it was worthwhile to do such an effort...because I'm Italian, and I was used to read only translations.<BR> But Puzo's language is so beautiful and intense that you cannot give up....you must read his books, just the way he wrote them!<BR> _The Godfather_ is an absolute page turner. The characters are extraordinarily vivid and true. Maybe, my favourite is Santino Corleone -a very amazing mixture of violence and tenderness- but I loved the other personages as well, especially Tom Hagen.<BR> They say: beware, this book teachs you to love the mafia. In my opinion, it teachs to love mankind, in good and evil.<BR> The movie was very good indeed , but I think that the book is even much better.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|Being a fan of Submarine movies I found U-571 a thrill ride from start to finish. Probably the best thriller of its kind since Das Boot I thought Mostow deserved a great deal of credit for his ability to waste not a bit suspense while paying so close attention to detail. Considering the ship had to be built from scratch for the movie the look and feel is so authentic you can almost smell the B.O. and spoiled food. The ensemble cast came off somewhat stiff with Matthew McConaughey leading the way. Although there were a few good acting moments the film is definitely dependent upon the action and effects to carry it. History buffs jilted the film for its inaccuracy since the first enigma machine was indeed captured by the British but, like other films have proven in the past as well as this summer, history should be taught in the class room and not on the movie screen. U-571 is an action adventure story which celebrates the courage of young men fighting for a cause but it is a fictional story set against an historical backdrop. The DVD extras are certainly worthwhile with commentaries, interviews, as well as documentaries. The picture and sound are what it's ultimately all about and U-571 delivers. The picture is beautiful and the Dolby Digital 5.1 is among very best soundtracks I've ever heard on a DVD and it has to be for intense depth charge sequences. If you like action movies you'll apreciate it, If you love home theater you won't be able to do without this one.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Pardon the pun, but LB just keeps Rollin.  Limp has definately found their groove and for their fans this CD won't be a disappointment.<br />I didn't like it as much as &quot;Significant Other&quot;, but still an excellent CD.  Fred's vocals seem to improve with each new outing  while the band seems to be totally in sync (no not N'SYNC).<br />Nothing too experimental on this CD, but enough adrenaline pumping beats to keep most people happy
0312954468|2.0|The story has good action and likeable characters but some details bothered me. Like when Taita, the protagonist, disguised himself as a priest, he wore a wig, when in fact, Egyptian priests went completely bald.  The number of blond and green eyed characters didnt really convince me either, not in ancient egypt. And another thing that startled me was that the Ethiopian king, was referred to as 'fair skinned'. Also, according to Smith, the Ethiopians spoke Ge'ez when in reality that language hasnt been recorded at the time. And contrary to what was written here, iron wasnt introduced by the Ethiopians, it was introduced by the Hittites about a thousand years later than the setting of 'River God.' i would have enjoyed the book if it was a bit more accurate.
B000005IU1|4.0|One of rock history's crown jewels.  This album debunks the idea of the sixties being a big happy hippy rainbow.  Anti-anthems for  disaffected youth... No Fun, I Wanna Be Your Dog, Not Right, 1969.  This is a great album. (only for stars because We Will Fall can be a little tiresome, but it does have it's place.)
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|First off, if you haven't seen the movie yet don't get this cd. The soundtrack has to be listened and understood within the context of &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot;. It's possible for the cd to stand on its own, but it gains in emotional power if you know what happens in the movie.<br />With that being said I was highly disappointed that it wasn't fully faithful to the movie version of the songs. While I enjoyed hearing Catherine Denueve on 'Cvalde' I would rather have had Peter Stormare's vocals for 'I've Seen It All' and the original version of 'Scatterheart' You'll find some lyric switching between Yorke and Bjork in 'I've Seen It All' and the lyrics for 'Scatterheart' barely resemble that which was sung in the movie.<br />The greatest tragedy of all with this cd is the omission of 'The Next to Last Song'. A powerful moment in the movie is completely lost on this cd, rendering '107 Steps' and 'A New World' not as powerful as they were in the theater. Don't get me wrong though, you'll still find yourself moved by these tracks, but the moment is not complete without 'The Next to Last Song'.<br />I can only hope that somewhere down the line a more complete soundtrack will be released or the DVD will offer a music only track. While this is a terrific soundtrack and one that any movie music lover should own, it's not complete.
0679879269|3.0|Alas, I found this book to be tow long, as another reviewer said, another round of edits would have helped. As the author admits in the introductory material, he freely borrows ideas and techniques from others--I have no problem with that. In this case he seems to have borrowed the style of Tom Clancy with all of the jumping around between the various characters. Some plot lines, Fr. Gomez, should have been better developed or dropped. Clancy often does this with his Bart Mancuso character. He has to get him in for at least 50 pages with no justifiable reason.<br />Perhaps I haven't read the first two books recently enough, but it seems that the cosmology (the Authority, Metatron, etc) popped out without sufficient clues.
6305807086|5.0|When I first heard a movie was being released about getting into John Malkovich's head, I asked &quot;What?&quot; &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is a hell of a film, and is uncategorizable in terms of it's genre. It's part black comedy, part fantasy, part drama, and part thriller that stars attractive people John Cusack and Cameron Diaz as unattractive people. Former 80's star turned respected actor Cusack plays Craig Schwartz, a struggling Manhattan puppeteer with a message that no one will listen to and a job that no one will hire him for. Facing pressure from his wife (a really, really ugly Cameron Diaz) Lotte, a pet store owner, Craig gets a job as a filing clerk at Lester Corp on the 7 1/2 floor of an office building. He befriends Maxine (Catherine Keener), a sharp tongued office sexpot who turns Craig down at every shot. Craig also befriends his boss Lester (Orson Bean) a nice old man with a hell of a secret. While working, Craig discovers a door that leads him into the mind of John Malkovich of which he spends 15 minutes and then finds himself ejected onto the New Jersey Turnpike. Havoc ensues for Craig, Lotte, Maxine, and John Malkovich himself in this strange film. Spike Jonze has got the right timing to direct the scenes of this truly bizarre film. Having an incredibly offbeat tone, Being John Malkovich is one of the best films of the year and a standout of the different films that came out this year following American Beauty, The Sixth Sense, Fight Club, The Blair Witch Project, Dogma, and The Matrix among others. The DVD is surprisingly delightful minus any deleted scenes or commentary. It comes with a featurette about puppeteering, a short video diary of being a driving extra, and two featurettes from the film itself as well as it's marketing campaign. One odd thing is a supposed interview with director Spike Jonze that ends on a gross note.
B000000WFF|5.0|I thought this was great and I have to buy it. The ablum has class and i totally love it. My fav song off the ablum is 'stop' and i was totally gutted when it went in at 2. Spice Girls rule

158234082X|4.0|I found this book to be an entertaining read, quick and a tad bit sleazy - the perfect book for a plane or the beach.  As a devote foodie, I laughed, was disgusted by some scenes and salivated over others!  Not literary genius but certainly fun!
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|I have been a huge fan of Bjork since I first heard POST/1995 (Hyperballad,  Its Oh So Quiet, Married to myself,Possibly may be...) and as I listened to her more and more, Debut/1993 (Venus as a Boy,One Day,Come to me..),Telegram/1996,Homegenic/1997 (Hunter,Immature..) Bjork landed in a special place in my limited  but diverse roster of favorite artists (Mariah Carey, Macy Gray, Etta James,James Taylor,Sting among the few).<br />When I saw that the &quot;Dancer in the Dark&quot; soundtrack had only 7 tracks I was a bit disspointed but it is well worth the full price I paid since all the songs and tracks on the album have been so beautifully and intelligently performed and produced by BJORK. My favorites starting w/ the best are:<br />1. New World.(Only Bjork can take this ballad to its cinematic    climax the way it does) 2.In the Musicals.(Those who think Bjork is irritating will see the flipside and realize how wrong they are in this song) 3.107 Steps.(Another somber and moving track that ends w/ a tragic yet climatic melody) 4.Cvalda. (The intro to this song w/ the heavy machine sound...I thought it was neat....may seem acerbic to some people but wait until you hear the entire catchy tune. In this song Bjork leaves the ballads and returns to her trademark free spirited, girlish tantrum throwing style that only she can do so well.Catherine Deneuve's participation is also a plus) 5.I've Seen It All. The duet of the album, w/ Thom Torke, shows that Bjork, who normally doesn't sing duets,can do that very well indeed.This song has a depressing tone but that only helps convey the story underlying Dancer in the Dark. 6.Overture. The non vocal extravaganza that opens the album is very movie like and apt to the movie's sad theme 7.Scatter Heart. I like the starting of this track more than the ending.<br />Overall this is an excellent EP. It still would have been a lot better w/ a few more tracks and if it included the lyrics and may be even some pictures from  the movie(hence the 4 stars). Thats why I can't wait until Bjork comes out w/ her next full studio album, DOMESTICA, next year,<br />I have also heard that Bjork's extraordinary acting in Dancer In the Dark is generating a lot of Oscar Buzz (she has already won the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actress award earlier this year). Even though she announced after winning that award that she will never act again and rather devote the next 50 years in creating beautiful music, I hope she changes her mind and showcases her talent both in music and acting.<br />&quot;Selmasongs&quot; does actually grow on you but any Bjork fan or fan- to-be should love this album from the get go.
B00000BKDV|4.0|It would have been practicly impossible to make a equally stunning follower to Number Of The Beast so it's understandable that Piece Of Mind is not quite as good. But still, it's a truly amazing album. Especially the first five feature such masterpieces as &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, &quot;Flight Of Icharus&quot;, &quot;Die With Your Boots On&quot; and &quot;The Trooper&quot;. There aren't really a weak song on this album, but of course the stand-out tracks aren't quite as amazing as the ones on N.O.B. Still, one of the best Maiden releases. Mie lhen karhhuun...
B000000H64|5.0|This Cd is seriously heavy and by far Fear Factory's best album.  I have to say that Burton's vocals are second only to Barney Greenway from Napalm Death.  Zero Signal, Pisschrist, Self Bias Resistor, Replica, New Breed all anchor this album.  Demanufacture is so well produced that you will not believe that this is their major label debut.  This album shames Obsolete, so if your just getting into Fear Factory definitely buy this first and then Soul of a New Machine and proceed very cautiously to Obsolete(hardcore fans only).  I hope that this was not Fear Factory's peak but if it was its a damn worthy obituary.
0312243022|5.0|In 1925, Virginia Woolf published her masterful novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  Set during a single day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway, Woolf brilliantly used techniques which became hallmarks of the modern novel--interior monologue, first person narrative and a stunning, albeit unrelentingly difficult, stream-of-consciousness rendering--to produce one of the masterpieces of twentieth century English literature.  Nearly seventy-five years later, Michael Cunningham has used many of these same techniques to write \\"The Hours\\", a fitting homage to Woolf and a novel which deservedly won both the PEN/Faulkner Award and the Pulitzer Prize.<br />\\"The Hours\\" tells the story of a bright June day in the lives of three different women living in three different times and places.  The first story is that of Virginia Woolf during a day in 1923, when she is writing \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\".  The second is the story of Laura Brown, a thirtyish, bookish married woman living in the suburbs of Los Angeles.  Laura has a four-year-old son and is pregnant with another child as she plans a birthday dinner for her husband on a day in 1949.  The third story is that of Clarissa Vaughn, a fifty-two year old, slightly bohemian, literary agent who is planning a party for Richard, her long-time friend and one-time lover, a prominent writer dying of AIDS.<br />\\"The Hours\\" is, among other things, a nuanced and sensitive picture of middle age in the lives of its characters.  Like the novel to which it pays tribute, \\"The Hours\\" relies heavily on interior monologue-on thoughts, memories and perceptions-to drive the narrative and to establish a powerful bond between the reader and each of the female protagonists.  The reader feels the psychic pain of the aging Virginia Woolf as she contemplates suicide in the Prologue. The reader has an almost tactile sense of Laura Brown's claustrophobia, of her feeling that life is closing in around her, as she flees to a hotel for two hours in the middle of the day simply to spend time reading (\\"Mrs. Dalloway\\", of course).  And the reader can identify with the yearning, the melancholy, that is suggested when Clarissa Vaughn thinks back to the time when she was young, when her life's choices had not yet been made. <br />\\"The Hours\\" is written, in short, like all great fiction--with deep feeling and love for its characters-and it stands as one of the outstanding American novels of the past decade. While resonating with the themes, techniques and characters of Woolf's difficult modern masterpiece, \\"The Hours\\" is masterful and original in its own right, an accessible and engaging work that is worth all the time you spend with it.

6303347657|1.0|Jim Carrey one of Hollywood's most annyoning players plays the ultimate loser in this rather chidish and yet another uninspired attempt to try to woo an audience. He plays Stanley, a bank clerk, a nice guy who is such pushover that one day he stumbles across a mask belonging to ancient god of who knows what and becomes a macho green guy who tries to imitate Clint Eastwood. The special effects alone is fanatastic but that's the only good thing worth mentioning in this lame film. If Jim<br />Carrey continues to go on this self indulgent path to make child like films that see him as an horse's behind he won't be around for a long time to come because people will get sick &amp; tired of seeing his same old antics on the silver screen. Cameroen Diaz as Carrey's love intrest please! she must need the cash badly to take part in a comedy masscare like this. Is Jim Carrey worth $20 Millon per film after seeing this you won't think so anymore.

If you like Here With Me and Thank You, you will like this whole cd.  My favorite tracks are: Here With Me, Hunter, DOn't Think of Me, Thank You, Honestly OK, Don't Slide, No Angel, and Take My Hand.  They all have catchy melodies and her voice sounds reallie good. Trust me.
6305622930|5.0|George C. Scott becomes the living breathing &quot;Blood &amp; Guts&quot; Patton with his masterful depiction of the WWII legend.  Patton, commander of the US 3rd Army was instrumental in the collapse of Germany's Western front, and few would argue the 3rd Army was most effective combat force in the ETO.  The German General Staff feared and respected Patton, while they laughed at Montgomery, his British contemporary and competitor.  Patton was no ordinary 20th century warrior, he frequently drew from ancient history for inspiration for his battle plans.  Patton took the whole Blitzkrieg(lightning war) concept from Guderian, and took it to the next level.  Patton ranks as one of the most colorful and complex personalities of the Second World War.  A great DVD, well done, with the bonus DVD of the making of this landmark picture.  A must for anyone who appreciates great acting, action, sets, and history.  Arguably, the best war film ever made, and at this point in time the best War film DVD.
6302897270|4.0|For those of you that didn't appreciate this movie... you must not have one ounce of sexuality. I feel for you all and your mates, because if you hadn't experienced any of those scenes for yourself before you saw the movie I would think that you would have afterward. The movie is about being unable to control yourself when you are with this other person... giving freely of yourself... everything else in the world goes away when you with this person.  Degrading to women, you have to be kidding right? This successful female finds someone that is so different, unlike her so called peers, that she is fascinated by him rather than being sickened by him. Gee wouldn't be nice to find a few men like that to take us away from all of this madness even if it is just for a few hours at a time. I believe that this movie explores a side of sex that more people should look at, it might just make you happier people. I really dislike it when people judge things that they are unwilling to try. Most of the reviews I read were of the content not of the movie, so here's another to add to the list. <br />As for the movie, it had some unbelievable camera work. The angles and lighting made the scenes even more powerful. The movie really pulled you into what was going on at the time.

B00001NFCY|5.0|I love this CD! I got this CD because of the song 'with arms wide open'. I still like that song but it gets old... I recommend this cd to anyone who is into alternative. Or anyone who liked 'higher' and 'with arms wide open' or 'what if'. The lyrics are powerful and meaningful. There's only about one slow song on this albulm, 'with arms wide open'. The others are fast and loud. Buy this CD! You'll love it!

Chickenhawk details the mass use of helicopters for delivering and retrieving troops in major assaults.  It's also interesting as the author is not convinced the war is just.  He routinely sees death and sometimes freak accidents, and slowly goes crazy from the stress.
B000002A46|5.0|Mariah proves she is a pop diva with no inhibitions about praising her Lord Jesus and sharing her Christmas joy and love in a most intimate and lively way.  God Bless her!  She belts out her most passionate and spirited vocal energy and really lets her gospel hair down on this CD.  Her rendition of &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; will have tears in your eyes while at the end of the CD,  &quot;Jesus, What A Wonderful Child&quot; will have you  dancing around, throwing your hands in the air praising the Lord, shouting AMEN..and singing along with chills (maybe even if your not a Christian!).  The entire CD will get the  true Christmas Spirit moving through you faster than Santa can come down your chimney and will touch the hearts of even the Grinches among us!  This CD is about feeling and healing.  You will feel the healing energy in the last song as it miraculously wipes out any  seasonal or holiday blues you may have.<br />The secular favorite &quot;Santa Claus is Comin' to Town&quot; and a very cool, creative and 'peppy' medley of Three Dog Night's &quot;Joy to the World&quot; and the classic Christmas version add to the holiday cheer.<br />This is another contemporary Christmas CD that is destined to become a Christmas classic because of the powerful, passionate, healing energy and upbeat spirited emotion it invokes.<br />(OK Mariah, now how about convincing the record execs to let you add more of your  raw gospel influence to your regular pop albums?)
B0000033OZ|5.0|In 1970 keyboard player Keith Emerson of Nice and Greg Lake of King Crimson bolted from their groups and joined with drummer Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster to form the most successful power trio in the history of progressive rock.  Only Renaissance could be said to have more explicitly incorporated classical music into its sound that Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer.  The trio were regarded as technical virtuosos on their instruments, to such a point that their performances surely could not match their reputations.  Lake might not be as great a guitarist as the other two were on their instruments, but when I was a lad if you had given me my choice of any one's voice in rock and roll, I would have wanted to sing like Greg Lake (Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer also have some of the more interesting &quot;what ifs&quot; around in terms of their origin, since there were rumors of Jimi Hendrix joining the group and Steve Howe of Yes actually auditioned).<br />The self-tilted 1971 debut album (mostly recorded the previous year), is a mix of the bombastic synthesizer overkill that could dominate some of their early work (such as the first side of their next album, &quot;Tarkus&quot;) and the subtle balance between Lake's vocals and Emerson's piano playing. The former is represented by the instrumental opening track, &quot;The Barbarian,&quot; which sets up a radical shift to the former with &quot;Take a Pebble.&quot;  This song was ELP's first released single, and would become one of the improvisational standards of the group in concert.  The &quot;first side&quot; ends with &quot;Knife-Edge,&quot; based on a theme by Janacek I believe, and is one of the rare examples of balance between Emerson's synthesizer and Lake's vocals.  You have to remember that the synthesizer was a new toy at that time and perhaps Emerson should be forgiven for taking it out so unrelentlessly at times on a test drive.<br />&quot;The Three Fates,&quot; like &quot;Take a Pebble,&quot; owes much to classical forms and provides ample evidence of my contention that Emerson was much more proficient on a piano than on an organ.  &quot;Tank&quot; represents the third synthesized work while &quot;Lucky Man,&quot; the group's first and biggest hit single, showcases Lake's haunting vocals against an acoustic guitar, with a synthesizer solo at the end.  You cannot help but wonder what else Greg lake might have written if he did not have to contend with Emerson's propensity to longer and longer keyboard works.  Any how, on Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer's debut album we end up with three synthesizer songs and three piano/guitar songs.  I give the latter 5 stars and the former 3 stars, but &quot;Lucky Man&quot; is a 6 and &quot;Knife-Edge&quot; a 4 and that ends up a 5 because I can make this stuff up as I go along.

0316921173|4.0|I'm not really going to try to add anything new to the 200 reviews already posted; all I'll say is that you should keep in mind the time committment this book will require versus what you expect to come away with.  Infinite Jest will probably take you 2 months to read (1.5 if you're fast), and it consists of wildly entertaining and original episodes that don't necessarily equal a complete story.  So if you think two months is a long time to spend on a book that doesn't reach any kind of real resolution, then Infinite Jest might not be for you; on the other hand, if you can put aside any expectations of receiving a good ol' fashioned exposition/climax/denoument and just appreciate the mastery of language and humor, then the two months might be worth it.
B00004X01U|4.0|After a break of two years Madonna is back with probably the best album of her career. The lyrics are more personal than ever, and although the production is different to anything she's ever done before, she still retains that distinctly Madonna sound. Highlights are &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; and &quot;Paradise (Not For Me)&quot;. Whilst there are usually two or three tracks to skip on a Madonna album, at last she's put one together where every track is a goodie. A recommended buy.
B0000033P2|5.0|There two things I always remember about this album is that every time the beginning of &quot;From the Beginning&quot; played on the radio it sounded so much like the beginning of &quot;Roundabout&quot; by Yes, and that the end of &quot;Living Sin&quot; was used as the theme music for one of the local television news shows in Albuquerque.  &quot;Trilogy&quot; was the third album from Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, the British Progressive (nee Classical) Rock group and it is certainly interesting in retrospect to consider those first three albums as a set.  On their self-entitled debut album, ELP offered a balance between tracks featuring synthesizer overkill by keyboard virtuoso Keith Emerson and the melodic compositions of guitarist Greg Lake, wherein Emerson turned in his organ for a piano.  Their second album, &quot;Tarkus,&quot; went in the first direction, with the Tarkus Suite representing their best effort along those lines.  &quot;Trilogy,&quot; represents the other direction of ELP, one which I personally favor.<br />The two parts of &quot;The Endless Enigma&quot; are bridged by a &quot;Fugue,&quot; that shows ELP's interest in pursuing classical musical forms, as does the final track, &quot;Abaddon's Bolero.&quot;  &quot;The Sheriff&quot; is one of those cute ditties the group tended to indulge in a bit too much, while &quot;Hoedown&quot; from Aaron Copeland's &quot;Rodeo&quot; is one of their better direct adaptations of a classical work.  &quot;Trilogy&quot; and &quot;From the Beginning&quot; highlight the instrumentality of the group in a clearer, cleaner style.  All in all, the high points on &quot;Trilogy&quot; are not as strong as on their debut album, but this certainly got ELP back on track for my money.
B00004XONN|5.0|You will be totally amazed with what Radiohead does with this album.  I think this is the best alternative album ever!  It has the most incredible soundscape, with instrument layered over instrument.  They also use trumpets (and other horns) in a way you'll never imagine (in 2 songs). If you buy one more album this year, this should be the one.
B0000035E7|5.0|Nirvana are the greatest band in history. This album is brilliant despite being their first attempt and being recorded for such a small amount. This album although released over a decade ago is still very listenable. The best tracks are : School, Blew, Love Buzz, Negative Creep, Paper Cuts, About A Girl, Floyd The Barber. But hey, they all rock! Kurts voice is amazing and passionate. The drumming isn't as good as the other albums as this was before the amazing Dave Grohl joined but get this album you will not be dissapointed.
0679879269|5.0|I have read his Sally Lockheart triolgy.  I never thought anything could be better than that.  Robert Cormier came close in  few of his books but never up to Phillip Pullman.  Then he decides to write another triology and at first I thought there was no way it could be better, but with the excitement and the tension and just the great story line along the way.  It makes you think about things we have no knowledge about.  He took a gigantic risk with saying the things he said in the book but that just made it better.  It was well written and I loved it ranking it the best book he's written thus the best book I've ever read.
B0000033P0|3.0|The British Progressive (nee Classical) Rock group Emerson, Lake & Palmer followed up their self-titled debut album with this second effort in 1971. That first album was a balance between the synthesizer overkill of Keith Emerson's keyboard work on tracks like \\"Knife-Edge\\" and the soaring melodic songs like Greg Lake's classic \\"Lucky Man.\\" However, \\"Tarkus\\" is most decidedly in the camp of the former. As such, the first seven tracks on this album, considered collectively as the \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" represents the best ELP effort in that vein, although \\"Aquatarkus\\" suggests the lads did not really have a way of ending the whole thing.<br /><br />\\"Tarkus\\" is made of seven parts, alternating four instrumental sections (\\"Eruption,\\" \\"Iconoclast,\\" \\"Manticore,\\" \\"Aquatarkus\\") with three songs (\\"Stones of Years,\\" \\"Mass,\\" and \\"Battlefield\\"). The suite does not really have a plot, although the cover artwork hints that Tarkus was some sort of hybrid armadillo tank that was born during a volcanic eruption. After a battle with a Manticore, Tarkus became Aquatarkus and apparently went swimming away to live happily ever after. However, if the story does not really hang together at least the music does, flowing from one section to the next and providing much more of a unified whole than we usually see in ELP's most ambitious efforts.<br /><br />For me \\"Tarkus\\" is just too much at the extreme of synthesizer excess in terms of ELP's music career, although the album did make it to #9 on the Billboard charts. I really like the later synthesis between the two styles the boys attained with \\"Karn Evil 9\\" on \\"Brain Salad Surgery,\\" although I suppose it comes down to a preference for the piano over the organ, which applies as much to the works of Beethoven and Back as it does to that of Keith Emerson. The rest of this album really comes across as leftovers from their first recording sessions that should have remained on the cutting room floor (\\"Jeremy Bender\\") with some really inane lyrics (\\"The Only Way (Hymn)\\"). After the thematic unity of the \\"first side,\\" the remaining hodge-podge is pretty lame. If you like the heavy synthesizer use the Tarkus Suite is a great example of Emerson on the organ. But if you prefer him on the keyboard and songs that better feature Greg Lake's vocals (best represented by the \\"Battlefield\\" movement of the suite), \\"Tarkus\\" will have a lower place in your ELP rotation.)\\").

B00004XQP4|5.0|green day, the best punk band of all time, besides nofx.  this cd is simply delightful. it sounds like irish bar music along with tradition green day sounds.  songs like church on sunday and castaway are more on the softer side along with macey day parade which is the slowest song on the cd but it also shows that they have grown up alot since they came out with &quot;dookie&quot; which talks about masturbation and drugs, when this cd talks about faith, relationships and other things. this album is  an overall positive album which won't annoy your parents.

He proves he still has what it takes to be great.
B00004X01U|4.0|Madonna combines that electronic sound that has served her very well with some recent hits and combines it with a little bit of folk to make \\"Music\\", her latest album.  The album starts with a triple punch of pure energetic dance clips.  From the near infamous French disco of the title track to the  \\"Impressive Instant, a hot combo of club grooves and silly sexy lyrics. Then \\"Runaway Lover\\" is a trip of hard beats and smart story telling that entraps its listener like a good book. I was reading Pride and Prejudice at the time and they kind of sounds like some of the characters in the novel.  Very stylish and smart.  Then there is her new combo of folky story telling ballads like \\"Gone\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"I Deserve It\\" (after a while it gets country with words like \\"Many miles, many roads I have traveled...\\").     Kind of weak inline with heavy synth laced ballads like \\"Nobody's Perfect\\" and \\"Paradise (Not For Me)\\".  And neither of those are perfect.  \\"Amazing\\" is a good kind of retro jam in the likes of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\". Probably the best of the mid tempos/ballads is \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\".  It's an almost laughably honest song.  It's a cute account on being a girl, but seems silly.        <br />It's almost been a sad running gag of Madonna making near brilliant all over albums, with a few flaws for the past few years.  For one, this album is way to short. \\"Ray of Light\\" had the problem that was it was way to long.  What happened here?  Madonna finds a new kind of sound and doesn't want to explore it farther?  Also, this one is extremely weak vocal wise and I'm sure Madonna knows it.  I don't know that she was aiming for good vocals.  She accomplished that well on \\"Ray\\", tough.  You can't tell Madonna fans not to buy a Madonna album.  It's a nice chapter in her songbook, but for people that want to explore Madonna, hold off and buy something like \\"True Blue\\" or \\"Like A Prayer\\" first.  This album was shinning moments, but doesn't work very well as a solid unit.  Again, can't wait for Madonna's new album, but hopefully this one will do for now.

B00003CXE7|4.0|This movie has drawn many comparisons to Braveheart.  The basic difference between the two besides taking place in different times and in different countries ... is that Braveheart is supposed to be based around, however loosely, the life of William Wallace whereas Gladiator is almost purely fiction.<br />If one looks at &quot;Gladiator&quot; through the same lens through which they view Braveheart, they are not giving the movie a fair shake.<br />Gladiator is a good old-fashioned hero movie. It doesn't matter if its characters dress like real romans did or speak like them, which they obviously don't.  <br />What is endearing about Gladiator is primarily embodied in the character of Maximus.  He loves his family, he is loyal to the king, he fights for his ideals, he brings the smack down when necessary.<br />I give Gladiator 4 stars because I feel that is accomplished all that it set out to but it could have set out to accomplish more. <br />Just as a side note:  The action is all first-rate, I was especially impressed with the &quot;Battle of Carthage&quot; scene.
015650300X|5.0|Le Petit Prince is a magical story of a pilot and the Prince he meets in the middle of a desert.  The pilot, an adult, listen attentively as the Prince, seemingly a child; tells of his trip to Earth and the people he meets along the way.<br />The Prince has journey to Earth from an asteroid floating in space.  He tells the pilot of people such as a dedicated lamplighter living on an asteroid where night and day last only moments.  He also tells the pilot about the asteroid and about how sad he feels as he watches the sunset and then, watches it yet again, until he finally feels better.<br />The pilot and the Prince then make a journey together in search of a well.  Finally, the Prince must leave Earth to return to his asteroid and his own special rose.  The story ends with a simple request to the reader.<br />Although Le Petit Prince may seem to be nothing more than a simple and beautiful fairy tale it is really so much more.  It is a story for children, to be sure, but it is also a story for people of all ages who have not quite grown up.<br />But who is not quite grown up?  If you have read Le Petit Prince you will realize that a grownup is a person, who, even if there is a pitcher of water sitting in front of him, will choose, instead to walk to a fountain and take a drink.  This book has many things to say that are very important for all of us to hear, however, most of us never find the time to listen to the lessons it teaches.  There is magic in this little book:  in the fox, in the rose, in the asp in the sunsets and most of all, in the Prince's parting gift to the pilot.<br />The journey of the Prince and the timeless themes this book presents are woven together into an immensely beautiful story.  This is a sweet but profound little book that might change the way you look at things and live your life, if only just a little.

B00000373U|5.0|I play guitar and attempt to write songs...and the first time I heard Elliott was on &quot;Either/Or&quot;.  It made me want to cry when I listened to it because he embodies everything I've ever wanted to do as a songwriter.  I'm a big fan of later-era Beatles, and I feel that &quot;Either/Or&quot; successfully blends their flavor with Elliott's emotional musical poetry.  His voice is soothing as he pours out all his feelings- you not only are captivated by the music, but by the words as well. Simply put, this album is brilliant.  Don't believe me?  Read all the other reviews.  Everyone picks a different song as their favorite.  When every song on an album is touching to different people in different ways, you know it's something special.  My personal favorites are &quot;Alameda,&quot; &quot;Between the Bars,&quot; and &quot;Angeles&quot;.  Every track is a highpoint in its own way though, and it is such a beautiful work.  The ONLY disappointment about &quot;Either/Or&quot; is that it only clocks in at 37 minutes.  I want more!
0553106635|5.0|Amazing.  A fantasy series that actually gets better with every book, an author who can actually WRITE without insulting his adult audience, and real characters who pay the ultimate price.<br />I'm (almost) speechless.<br />Every prediction I made after Clash of Kings was WRONG. I was actually SURPRISED.  And not always pleasantly, as Martin deals harshly with characters that you love.  But I was always on the edge of my seat.  I have to read the book over again, because the first time my heart was in my throat and it was sometimes too heart-rending to concentrate on details.<br />Be prepared.  And be thankful that there is actually a deft practitioner of the art of fantasy somewhere in the literary world...
B00001W9G0|4.0|This DVD demonstrates why this medium is so fantastic.<br />I watched the film in its entirety, then watched the documentary, then watched the film all over again listening to Sydney Pollack's insightful commentary.  It was a completely different experience to do so.  <br />What his commentary highlighted was the subtlety of Redford's performance - he was brilliant.  I never rated him as an actor until I heard Sydney and Barbara's views on him.  The documentary, showing the missing scenes (and why they were deleted), provides an interesting persepective on the film and the characters.<br />If you love the movie, you will need to have this DVD.
B0000039PW|5.0|B.I.G. knew he was great. In an interview at the end of the first disc of &quot;Life After Death,&quot; he's talking about how it's too hard to hate him, and he says, &quot;C'mon, man, you don't have Ready to Die?&quot; knowing full well the interviewer did. Everyone does. And Biggie earned it.<br />This is probably one of my top five favorite albums. It's just loaded from front to back with great tracks and equally great rhymes. It was a young, hungry B.I.G. with nothing to lose and everything to gain. And gain he did. Enlisting top-notch producers the likes of Easy Mo Bee, Puff's Hitmen (before they sold-the-hell-out), The Bluez Bruthas and DJ Premier, he crafted the quintessential thug's guide to life. Songs like the brilliant &quot;Gimme the Loot,&quot; where Biggie converses with his psychotic alter ego about the robbery-in-progress, the hypnotic &quot;Big Poppa,&quot; and the driving &quot;Machine Gun Funk&quot; detail the various facets of the street life and how Biggie lived it.<br />But the highlights don't stop there. They really don't stop at all. Witness DJ Premier's amazing execution of &quot;Unbelievable,&quot; Easy Mo Bee's back-in-the-day-flavored &quot;Things Done Changed,&quot; and the brooding Lord-Finesse-backed &quot;Suicidal Thoughts.&quot;<br />Honestly, I can't find one bad thing about this album. And you won't be able to, either. This is hip-hop right here.
0553579908|3.0|I loved A Game of Thrones and promptly bought copies for all my friends when it came out in paperback.  I eagerly awaited A Clash of Kings.  Well, I liked it (I wish we could give half stars because I would have given it 3.5 stars), but I felt after reading 950 pages that I wasn't much further along in the story than I was at page 1.  Some of the characters I like trememdously, such as Arya and Tyrion and Catelyn.  Theon is interesting in his folly.  So, as a character study, it is a very interesting story.  Arya grows in her journey as does Jon Snow.  I like the conflict that goes on within Tyrion.  However, after I read the last word, I just asked myself, &quot;Ok, what happened story-wise in this novel?&quot;  Answer:  not enough to justify 950 pages.  Still, I'm looking forward to reading Book 3.  I just hope there is some form of movement in the story in that one.  I gave up on Robert Jordan's series, and I really don't want to do that to Martin's.  The characters are quite interesting.  I just don't want to feel as if I'm being led around to buy sequels obsessively just so the book company can get my dollar.
B00004Z459|5.0|Bought the cd after hearing &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the radio.  The rest of the disc is great......especially &quot;With You&quot; and &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;.  This is probably the first cd i have owned where I like all of the tracks.  Linkin Park rules!
B00004SCX6|1.0|this album is by far the WORST album i EVER listened to! all the songs are xerox copies of the songs off of &quot;....baby one more time&quot;. just listen to &quot;don't let me be the last to know&quot; it's like &quot;from the bottom of my broken heart&quot; but with a sythzer in the background! the title track is annoying! how many times does britney have to say &quot;yeah yeah&quot; that song is about being a player not what her teenybopper fans think! most of the songs couldn't be saved by other singers infact britney should have never been signed in the first place! what did britney do in the first place that the album is called &quot;oops!.... i did it again&quot;? she also copied mariah carey's &quot;butterfly&quot; album cover and she claims to like madonna. well,if that WERE true she wouldn't be copying off of mariah carey all the time now would she? this album is going to sound dated in like a few months in fact all her songs sound dated as it is! &quot;oops i did it again&quot; is getting VERY overused in the media and i'm NOT talking about the song! like the media has been overusing that phrase TOO much and it's becoming old FAST! this album has no chances of surving shelf life once britney is a washed up has been! &quot;baby one more time&quot; is a WAY better album then is one and it doesn't get annoying fast like &quot;oops&quot; does! don't waste your time on this one it's sure to land in a pile never to be seen again and collect dust.
B000001ESJ|5.0|When Rush wrote this album they were at their very peak of musical talent. This album has everything a true Rush fan could want.
6303022901|1.0|I saw this movie because I had to read the book for school.  This story does not captivate the viewer, there is no plot.  The whole story is exposition.  The closest thing to a climax is where the two people do it on a wall.  Don't worry, you only get the picture, it's not graphic.  The movie sucks.  I would give 0 stars, but Amazon won't let me.  The movie was a complete waist of time.  Save your self the moner and time and go watch something with a plot, or atleast some humor!
B000002JOH|5.0|Vulgar Display Of Power is Pantera's follow-up to their successful Cowboys From Hell album! VDOP is another excellent album! It surely delivers the goods that one would expect from Pantera! Dimebag Darrel once again proves his guitar playing skills on this album! Yes! Phil can sing besides simply screaming! This Love is a great track! My faves have to be Mouth For War, New Level, Walk, F**king Hostile, This Love, Rise, Regular People, and Hollow! The album flows through very nicely; each track is entertaining! This album is Must-Buy for hardcore fans of Heavy Metal and you won't be disappointed with it!
0060976624|4.0|There is a reason why it's a bestseller. Hollywood, guns, Oprah, death threats; in short, Thank You for Smoking, covers everything America idealizes in this raucous account of Nick Naylor's profession as chief spokesman for the Academy of Tobacco Studies.   Compared to Hitler, satan, Stalin, and other proteges of evil, Nick struggles (with a cigarette constantly at his lips) to beat back the wave of neo-Puritanism sweeping the nation. His hilarious escapades, often underscored with scathing insights by the narrator, lead to a climactic finish.   Christopher Buckley, also author of, Little Green Men, has thoroughly researched the hot topic of tobacco and has added all the unexpected twists and jokes of a true craftsman. an enjoyable, intriguing, quick read that might just make you reach for a pack of your favorite cigarettes, even if you don't smoke.
B000001K2V|5.0|I have never understood the hoopla about Uchida's playing. For my ears her Mozart is too heavy. This set by Klien has been my favoirte recording of the Mozart Piano Sonatas for a long time. I also have the set recorded by Lili Kraus which is interesting to the point of being bizarre in some of the pieces but I like it none-the-less. Her live playing was also extremely heavy. But back to Klien...this set is a shining jewel and you will not find a lower price.
0679879269|5.0|The greatest fantasy series to come from the past twenty years isn't the bestselling Harry Potter series or the overblown Robert Jordan (Wheel of Time) books.  It is His Dark Materials, perhaps the second most innovative fantasy trilogy I have ever read, next only to The Lord of the Rings.  The characters are complex, dynamic, and well-developed.  Mrs. Coulter, in particular, behaves in a manner that contrasts her actions in the other books.  Side characters such as Dr. Mary Malone are developed, while the main characters - Lyra and Will - become even more endearing and well-written.  The end, in particular, is superlative and sad.  I had high expectations for the third book in the series of The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, but Phillip Pullman has surpassed them all.  Truly an excellent book.
B0000024SI|5.0|Highway 61, along with Bringing it all Back Home, make up two of Dylan's most important albums. A reviewer above said that he must have been arrogant to put his voice on his creations, but I think his unique voice fits better than anyone else's possibly could have; he isn't any opera singer, and that's not the point. This album isn't about pretty singing, it's about society's changes, especially in the amazing &quot;Ballad of a Thin Man&quot;, which is an incredible song that is often overlooked.           These songs make you think, they are a kind of musical poetry that, as clicheed as it may sound, &quot;defined a generation.&quot; &quot;Queen Jane Approximately&quot; and &quot;Desolation Row&quot; are both haunting and interesting to listen to, as well as the classic &quot;Like a Rolling Stone.&quot; You don't need to classify Dylan as a good musician or singer to decide that this album is good---Just listen to it!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|i respect Lenny kravitz for his focus on creating music.but his albums overall can be hit&amp;Miss.My Favorite of His is still Are You gonna go my way.i dig his Arrangements alot.he wears his influences a little to much for me overall but he has had impact over the past decade.it ain't over till it's over is my jam by him.he has one of the baddest Drummers&amp;horn Sections right now in the business.this set is all you will ever really need from.it captures him fully better than his other albums have combined.he should put out a Live Album.he is better Live.
B00004Z459|4.0|You can stop waiting for the next best thing in rock n roll.   The debut album by Linkin Park is the best I've heard in a long time.  These newcomers combine rock, rap, sampling, scratching, and a variety of other genres to create a sound fusion that's all their own.  The first single, One Step Closer, is as angry and sonically powerful as anything Limp Bizkit or Papa Roach has ever released.  The vocal tandem of Mike and Chester provide a perfect balance in order to come at the listener from all directions.    Finally a band has released an album where all the tracks don't sound like the same song.  Especially of interest is the band's DJ and resident sampler, Big Bad Mr. Hahn, whose influence can be heard dramatically in such songs as Papercut and By Myself.  Mr. Hahn adds another layer to the music that most bands are missing.  His skills serve the complement the resounding bass and drums that are the backbone of Linkin Park's unique sound.  The band really excels in mixing up the tempo of each song and surprising the listener with each passing minute.  Don't be fooled by the ballad-like beginning of Crawling (one of the album's finest tracks), the band raises and lowers the intensity enough to get a strong point across.    Hybrid Theory is a very beautiful yet intense debut album.  Although not an instant classic in the rock cannon, the album shows the kind of promise most new bands at this time are lacking.  If Hybrid Theory is any indicator, Linkin Park will soon be known to rock fans throughout the world.
B00004Y2QT|2.0|while Prince is one of my all time favorites this Show didn't do it for me.the band wasn't happening&amp;Prince just wasn't with the Groove.even my Jam She's Always in My Hair was boring.it was cool with him&amp;Lenny doing there thing.Larry Graham was alright but overall this is far below Sign O The Times.The Band was not happening&amp;the Greatest hits just didn't move me this time.but i heard he has a new band&amp;album coming so we shall see.
0399146253|3.0|Being a huge Patricia Cornwell fan I could not wait to get a copy of The Last Precinct in my hands. I only give the book 3 stars because it just does not pull the reader in like previous Cornwell novels. I hope Kay Scarpetta is only having a mid-life crisis. Don,t waste your money wait for the paperback.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Ok. This cd is very very good but its not the best. There best Cd is Three Dollar Bill Y'all$ by far, but anyways this Cd is very good and I recommend it for anyone especially hardcore Limp fans. I got this Cd outta Fan Devotion but even if I wasnet a huge limp fan i still woulda got this Cd ,its awesome not too much rap or too much screaming its just perfect.
B00004UEN8|5.0|Why didn't my earlier review of this show up?  Anyway, this version of ART MEETS THE RHYTHM SECTION is a remaster using JVC's proprietary K2 Super coding process.  What does this mean?  It means that Art never sounded better.  This record is a jazz classic, required listening, must have etc.  The mike placement and channel mixing still stinks, Art way over on the left channel and the rhythm boys way over on the right but it sounds like it was recorded yesterday.  Art is very clean, clear and distinct like he is sitting on a bar stool in your listening room.  The drum and cymbals are a real stand out.  If you have not heard this (k2)CD then you have not heard this record yet.  Deletes all previous efforts.  Buy it now as all this K2 stuff from the boys at Fantasy Jazz is limited edition.
0140186395|5.0|Forget the movie. It stinks.  read the book instead. This is a wonderful book. I have heard people say that it is all symbolic and metaphorical, and not in the least realistic. That is not true. The background characters, such as Adam and Cathy, are certainly symbolic. I'll concede that. Adam is unable to bear evil, and in a sense, he is good, but he, in his goodness, is cruel to his son Cal by not accepting him for who he is and always comparing him unfavorably to his twin brother Aron. Cathy, who is a person completely lacking a conscience, to the point where she sees nothing wrong with incinerating her parents to steal their money. But she is still attracted to the &quot;good&quot; character of her son Aron, and tries to protect him from Cal. She recognizes that there is something about Aron that is admirable that she doesn't have. What she can't see is that Aron, like his father, can unintentionally be cruel. What Adam and Cathy represent is that good and evil is never complete-- Adam is evil because of his goodness, and even Cathy is not a complete monster. Now to Cal, who in my opinion is the main character. Is his rage realistic? As a twin, I think so. I don't want to kill my sister, but there are times when I wish she were dead. Or at least far away and out of my life. I don't want to be constantly compared to my sister, who gets better grades, who is nicer, who is more religious. I can understand Cal's rage, becuase I share in it. Poeple say they wish they had a twin, to share secrets, to have a best friend always there, etc. What they don't realize is that the bad part comes along with it. You can't get away from this person. You live in the same house, go to the same school, perhaps belong to the smae cicrle of friends. Soon, perhaps when you are about five years old or so, I'm serious, you want some time to be alone. And you can't find it. You want to be your own person, and you can't and you rage against the person who prevents that. You try to acoomplish something on your own. What else do you think Cal is doing when he invests in beans. But his father takes away his pride in that by saying he wasn't fair to the farmers, and again, compares him negatively to his brother. I have not yet had such a problem. But if I did, I know I would be so angry at my sister that I would want to hurt her as badly as I could. cal does that to Aron, when he shatters all of Aron's illusions about their mother, showing him that she is a murderer and the madam of a whorehouse.  So don't say a book isn't realistic just becuase it is outside the range of your experience. Maybe it is part of someone else's experience. maybe you just don't understand. What amazes me most, is that Steinbeck, who wasn't a twin himself, understood. The man was a genius.  Oh, as a side point, Steinbeck quotes a hebrew word from Genesis. Timshel. That is slightly incorect, as there is no such conjugation of (m,sh,l) The corect version is timshol. A slight difference, but notworthy to any hebrew speaker. It means that you, in the future, will conquer  or rule [something] Steinbeck was pretty close.
B00003Q438|5.0|Everyone who likes sci-fi movies must add this excellent DVD to his/her collection.<br />The movie has great ideas which are well presented. Besides this DVD has an excellent work in the special features and offers an excellent sound quality.<br />This DVD offers the Special Edition of the movie, with 28 minutes of added footage.<br />The story is original and although you can see better special efects now a days, you can notice an excellent work (taking in consideration that the movie was made in 1989).<br />The story presentes the possibility that an advanced alien race could be living in our oceans.<br />The movie doesn´t have too much action (it does have some, but not as an essential part of it), instead, it has a deep meaning and a little suspense, the scenes are well written and worked.
0879306033|4.0|What a FUN book! If you were around when these synths were king, then this is a true trip down memory lane! Tons of pictures, including a color section, and chapters on Moog, PAiA, Buchla, Korg, Yamaha, ARP etc (Roland could use more coverage, and my beloved Yamaha CS-60 is not mentioned, though the CS80 is well covered). Most of Mark's information is fun and non-technical. This is not a how-to book, but more of a capsulation of the technologies, companies, and people surrounding the synthesizer revolution. A few factual errors and street prices that seem low since the analog synth resurgence are the only reasons I give it a 4. Also great pics of extremely rare synthesizers and lots of background stories on the companies. Highly Recommended (but dont believe the prices listed)
158234082X|1.0|A star wants to be born, amidst the puddles of animal fat, screams and blood. A star who finds sensual pleasure in frying animal fat and who openly hates vegetarians, compassion and anyone who's not as twisted as he is. An individual who longs for the exquisite taste of monkey brains (were the monkey's craneum top is removed while still alive, to die only with the trust of the metal spoon). This person embodies the worst of the qualities that have made the French so famous: a decadent sensory obsession and experimentation where anything and everything goes (and has), coupled with the arrogance and disdain of a people who long for appreciation they've never gotten. My veredict: This book is just another brick of the wall that separates France from civilization.
6300268470|5.0|Rio Bravo is a movie that just seems to get better with every viewing...Howard Hawks dynamic 1959 western is a boisterous and energetic film that has it's share of both tension, adventure &amp; laughs.<br />John Wayne is Sheriff John T. Chance....a traditional lawman caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse. After arresting Claude Akins (Joe Burdett) for shooting a man dead in a bar fight, Wayne has to endure the hired cronies of Akins' brother John Russell (Nathan Burdett) stalking the jail house trying to break Joe out. The only assistance on hand for the beleagured Wayne is recovering alcoholic Dean Martin (Dude) and crippled jailer Walter Brennan (Stumpy).<br />The odds are well and truly stacked against Wayne, but aid appears in the unlikely form of shy gunslinger Ricky Nelson (Colorado) and warm hearted, card shark Angie Dickinson (Flowers) as they both become embroiled in the tense stand off to keep everyone, including Joe Burdett, alive until the territory Marshall can get to town.....<br />Rio Bravo never slows down in it's journey and it appears that the actors on screen all enjoyed making this film....especially the brilliant Walter Brennan ( Where would westerns have ever been if Walter Brennan were never born ! ) who giggles and cackles his way through his sparkling time on screen....and even getting a kiss from John Wayne in the process. And we even get to hear Ricky &amp; Dean do a couple of duets...and Walter joins in!!<br />A worthy addition to any film fans library...Rio Bravo is western film making at it's best...another one that I can't wait to come out on DVD !!
B00004XONN|5.0|brilliant. disturbing. terrifying. I imagine if we could scrape at the darker insides of a mind like will self's, or william gibson's, or george saunders', or mark leyner's, KID A would perhaps be a good aural indication of what we might dig up there beneath our grubby, ragged, monkey fingernails. there is little consolation in the suspicion that the future's hypercapitalistic ultrahuman designer babies will look back with perfectly-calibrated eyes on the first crude injections of human embryos with foreign genes and on the arrival of Kid A as perhaps the first and last gropings of a species doomed to extinction by its own intelligence. in Kid A is the awareness of all this, and yet--somewhere underneath it all, the human heart still beating, despite. for whatever that's worth, for the time being. the sound of a dying old world slipping (almost) unawares into one frightfully new, frightfully unknown, frightfully uncertain in its inclusion of humanity as we now know it.
0792106989|5.0|Undoubtedly, one of the finest westerns ever made...this exquisite example of film making is proof positive that not every western is a simplistic plot about \\"cowboys and indians\\".<br />John Ford's stylish film is a brilliant psychological story about very different personalities and their violent meeting in the town of Shinbone. James Stewart plays the young, idealistic lawyer Ransom Stoddard...heading west in the hope of bringing law and justice to an untamed land. Enter Lee Marvin as the cold blooded and ruthless outlaw, Liberty Valance, ruling Shinbone and the surrounding territories by his own laws. And finally, John Wayne as the strong, iron-willed and well meaning Tom Doniphon....the only man with the courage to stand up to Liberty Valance.<br />Ford's movie is additionally supported by several dynamic character actors...Andy Devine as the cowardly sheriff Link Appleyard, Edmond O'Brien is simply brilliant as habitually drunk news paper editor Dutton Peabody, Woody Strode as Doniphon's loyal ranch-hand Pompy, plus the villainous duo of Lee van Cleef & Strother Martin. <br />What makes this movie so outstanding is that it appeals on so many levels....as an adventure, as a love story, as a tragedy, and ultimately as a tale well told. It moves with such eloquence and style, and the viewer is carried through each layer of this complex story with precision and feeling.<br />This is easily one of my most watched and most enjoyed films, and a moving reminder of a talented film maker and some very fine actors excelling in their craft.<br />I'm eagerly awaiting the DVD release of this one !!
B00004WKII|3.0|What can I say?  It's a box set of the music (both freeform and choriographed) of possibly the best rock band ever.  I'm a fervent Jimi Hendrix fan, and the only problem I have with this set is it's sheer size.  I haven't listened to it all (this will take hours and hours), and it's pretty intimidating.  However, having a collection of the best rock ever isn't something to be taken lightly.  Jimi, now as always, works his fantastic magic.  (three slices of toast)
B00004Z459|5.0|Okay, this CD is so sweet! It is, in a nutshell, a combination of Papa Roach, Limp Bizkit, a little bit of TOOL, some Kottonmouth King style, House of Pain, a little bit of Deftones and Korn, a lot of Hed(pE), Filter, heavy amount of Orion... to be brief, they rule.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I bought the CD because In the Musicals was getting German radio airplay.  Once hearing the whole CD, I felt hynotized by Bjork's sound, and most of all by &quot;New World.&quot;  This tune was haunting and yet comforting at the same time, and I have not stopped listening to it since.  Actually seeing the movie brought all the songs to a new level, so perfectly mixed, rhythm, movement, and sound among the story's characters.  I fell in love with Selma and felt her &quot;hearing with her heart&quot;, as she says in the movie. My daughter has not seen the movie, nor In the Musicals video, and yet she states the music made her envison the body movement, and she was right on the mark!  Wildly accurate!  Bjork achieved so much more when her music, enables a child who can't see the ability to put into words the movement the music conveys.  Pure genius...
6305903182|2.0|Okay, the movie itself...I love Jenny McCarthy and Parker Posey so I found it to be a &quot;cute&quot; movie among horror spoofs. And come on, that's what the whole series was, not a &quot;redefining&quot; of the genre. Watching this after having seen Scary Movie makes it even more hard to take seriously as a thriller/horror film.BUT...let's talk about DVDs and this one as a pretty good/bad example. I'm a Laserdisc collector. I am used to the finest quality found in the consumer market. DVDs are laughable in comparison! The ease and simplicity of DVDs are what makes them like candy, but for a serious collector this is not the format for you. All the bonus selections looked a step above a MPEG that you'd download off the Internet. In some sequences you couldn't make out a character's face!And unless it's hidden, my copy did not contain the Creed music video. No loss, but I found that a little odd. And the deleted scenes they did show were none of any substance. Two additional takes on the pre-title sequence that didn't add a thing to the story or build up. And the &quot;alternate&quot; ending? It still ended the same way, they only left out Sid's ridiculous bullet-proof vest device that makes it more like an episode of Scooby-do than anything. Who was it that said, &quot;let's go back and make that scene really, really stupid.&quot;
B00004T9UH|5.0|I love Eminem.  He is an awesome rapper.  I listen to it 24/7.If you have strict parents, don't even consider it.  When you go to buy a cd, with your strict parents, you want an edited version.  The truth is, the only word that the just barely try to edit out is the &quot;F&quot; word.  And, even then you can still tell what they are saying.  So, careful parents and or careful kids/people, 'yall might not want it.
B00003CXFG|2.0|I usually don't waste time with these types of movies but when I saw the previews I thought it could be an ok movie.  and it was pretty much . but thats about it.   I will give this movie credit for adding some new twists to a tired genre.  The monsters dont like light and there is some neat play with that but it doesnt really do much for the excitment.  One saving grace of course is the future action star Vin Diesel.  He plays a dangerous prisoner who can see in the dark and one total badass!    <br />  This movie does have its fans im sure.   It does have some originality . but not much
B000001Y42|5.0|Alright, I feel as if I must clear up a few things. People who think this CD is not good in quality, I see nothing wrong with your opinion. I personally find this CD to be very good. This is better than Significant Other; Chocolate Starfish, I don't know. Now, those of you who think that Limp Bizkit is &quot;the tool of the devil&quot; or that the members are &quot;the Four Horsemen&quot; (although the band has five guys in it), or any of that crap, you are obviously deluded. I see nothing wrong with not liking this CD (or others like it), but if you think that it is sacriligious, or evil, or something similar, you obviously are a member of a cult. See a psychiatrist, and understand that people CAN distinguish between fantasy and reality... well, some people. And rest assured, you culties are not included in that &quot;some&quot;.<br />Best songs: Stuck, Sour, and Faith.
B00003CXAR|5.0|I think pretty much everybody can agree that this movie started the whole Blockbuster thing and also the big monster genre in general.  It has spawned countless monster clones that have not touched this movie at all.  After 25 years it is still a chillingly good piece of work.  It hasnt lost any of its edge. Even the shark looks surprissinly good for its age.        When Jaws showed on tv a while ago I wasnt that excited. I thought maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it.   Boy was I wrong!  I watched the whole thing. not budging from my chair, my eyes glued to the television.  The plot I think everybody knows so Im not gonna go over it.  But If you expect it to show the shark in five minutes of the oppening credits. then you might want to skip it.  naaa watch it anyways to see how monster flicks should be done.  Without flashy special effects but with a little something called tension and suspense.<br />     The dvd is very good and a staple for any collection.  The picture is very clear for its age and the colors are bright.  Its got several trailers which are interesting to see since they are after all 25 years old.  Also included is a interesting documentary which shows how they got the shark to work.   Trust me its a must buy!
1573226521|5.0|This is a thoroughly enjoyable and intriguing book. The premise -- a &quot;lost&quot; island somewhere off the coast of Thailand, appeals to the adventurer in each of us; but the reality once the island appears appeals in a different way, to the utopian in each of us. Free land, free love, few obligations, and a great deal of relaxation. There's just a few things wrong ...<br />This is one of my favorite books of the last year....
B00000ILDE|5.0|A movie like this is very very difficult to make.  After all name one of the countless clones that came after this .  not one came close to it.  The story is pretty simple and everyone should know it. if they dont just look at another review.      James Cameron is a man's man (except maybe for Titanic).   he knows how to make a movie for the action lover .  and make it good he does.  Siqurny Weaver  (I know i misspelled her name, im sorry)  is a fantastic actress and can plays Ripley as a strong leader.  <br />      This movie is a must see and buy .  The dvd is fantastic.  and has some great extras  .  just go out and see it at the very least.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED
0792838084|3.0|Unfortunately I didn't think this film was as great as most of the other reviewers here at Amazon.  I think the lady that sang Blue Velvet was a very great actress, and some of the scenes with her in them were very moving and great.  And of course Dennis Hopper is always a great actor, and the parts with him in them were convincing as well.  However, I thought that the boy who was the main character, as well as his young girlfriend, were terrible actors.  Some of the lines sounded so awkward to me, as if they were in a high school play or something.  I wish they would have had more actors like the older lady (older in comparison to the young girl the boy was dating), and Dennis Hopper.  That would have made the movie so much better, but as it was with those two main actors, it seemed very corny and awkward in parts.  I did enjoy the original plot and some very moving scenes in this movie, so I do think it is worth watching.  However, I am only giving it three stars because in my opinion, it is weakened by the main actors.  I think this movie is worth watching for the positive points I've mentioned.  Also, many of the reviewers seemed to think this movie was excellent and gave it five stars, so don't take my word for it :), watch it yourself and see what you think.  It was probably just something personal I had against those two actors, but for some reason it just ruined some parts of the movie for me.
B00004U8JU|5.0|I destinctly remember going to the theater and seeing this movie and going &quot;wow&quot;.  There are very few movies that make me do this and this is definatly one of them.   Some of the scenes are sooo tense.  for example I breathed a HUGE sigh of relief after the car gets chased by the t-rex every time i see it.         This movie is one of Steven Spielburgs most fun movies and you are making a huge mistake if you dont see it.
B00004YRQA|1.0|This card is a major miss for Sony. <br />Sony has been bragging about the portability of its Memory Stick. Now, the PlayStation 2 is released and it does not support the Memory Stick! If anyone from Sony is reading this, PLEASE make an adapter for it at least! This could have been a great opportunity for increasing demand and support but instead it is farther evidence that the memory stick might be another Betamax in the making!
B00004XOWM|5.0|This is the best Bizkit has put out yet. The cd is filled with hard rocking songs, and even the ones where Fred sings about love lost are great. This is a great cd. If you cannot get pumped up by songs like Rollin(air raid version), you have a problem. And &quot;It'll be OK&quot; was probably the best song about losing someone you loved yet put out by Limp. This cd belongs in everyone's collection!
0140282033|5.0|Joanne Harris's first novel is a gem, small, but sparkling nonetheless. Her cast of chracters, mainly Vianne Rocher, are so startlingly human, you feel like you're one of their neighbors in the tiny French village of Lansquenet. I'm surprised that this didn't make Oprah's Picks. It's heartwarming, charming, humorous, and magical. The simple theme of good vs evil, which Harris depicts as the church vs chocolate, has never been this much fun. This is the perfect book for one of those chilly days when you're curled up near the fireplace with your mug of tea. It will definitely leave you with a smile on your face.
0375703764|4.0|Horrifying......... Ever walked down a country road, wondering what would happen if that road dissappeared, with you in it?  This book is geniunely scary, as far as the description of the Navidson Record is concerned.
0345350499|5.0|I guess I have to realize that not everyone loves this book,  however,when I read a negative review I just want to say, WHY??   It's clearly such an excellent novel... When I read the reviews where people say the book was good, but too long I am reminded by Mozart's words in Shaffer's  play Amadeus where he replies to the kings criticism that his opera has 'too many notes'...'there are neither more nor less notes than the piece requires, Majesty...it is perfect the way it is!' Please, please, please, if you truly love books you must read this one--it will not disappoint.
B00003CX8U|5.0|I'M USUALLY NOT ONE FOR MUSICALS BUT INDEED , AS PATER ONCE SAID, &quot;ALL ART ASPIRES TO THE CONDITION OF MUSIC.&quot; FOSSE UNFOLDS THE FREUDIAN &quot;DEATH WISH&quot; OF A MAN WHOSE LOVE WAS SUBLIME DECADENCE. MELONCHOLY LAUGHTER ACCOMPANIES YOU THROUGH A VISION OF A GUY WHO TRULY APPRICIATES THE BEAUTY AND IRONY OF THE HUMAN CONDITION. THIS  MOVIE HAS A HOLISTIC PHILOSOPHY THAT CAN ONLY BE REVIELED BY DELVING BELOW THE SURFACE WITH SEQUENCES OF FANTASY AND CONVERSATIONS WITH LOVELY DEATH. SCENES CUT BACK AND FORTH COMFORTABLY ILLUSTRATING LAYERS OF THE CHARACTER'S PSYCHE. THIS STYLE WILL BE GREATLY APPRICIATED BY FANS OF OLIVER STONE. SOME COULD ARGUE THAT FOSSE IS FAR MORE ACCESSIBLE, AND LESS OBSCURE THAN STONE. ALSO IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET THAT HEAVY THINKING FEELING THEN THE MOVIE ON THE SURFACE IS STILL EMMENCLY FUN, GOOFY...AN ABSOLUTE FOOT-STOMPING HOOT. IT'S JUST WHEN YOUR ROLLING ALONG YOUR FOURTH WATCHING YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF SAYING, &quot;MY GOD! THIS IS BRILLIANT.&quot; YOU'LL NEVER HAVE MORE FUN REFLECTING ON PRECIOUS LIFE.
B00000K19E|4.0|Say what you will about Keanu Reeves, but he's certainly getting better at picking vehicles for his &quot;acting&quot; talents. Also to his credit is the fact that only once was I reminded of his character from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Trust me, that's an improvement. This is Reeves at his best - standing there and looking pretty while the action happens around him.<br />There are a few themes that films can use that (in my mind, at least) almost always work well. The Matrix manages to touch on two of them: the fight for freedom and overcoming fear. Wrap that around a slick sci-fi core with some eye-popping effects and you've got something that can keep me in my seat and smiling for a couple of hours. Simply put, the movie just oozes cool. And that's a good thing. Hey, it worked great for The Fifth Element.<br />Overall, The Matrix is at its best delivering the stereotyped Hong Kong style action, but its the surrounding script and Reeves's supporting cast that make this a memorable flick. Laurence Fishburne gives a great, no-nonsense performance as Morpheus, the leader/father of a group of futuristic freedom fighters. My vote for the best performance in this one, though,  has to go to the small role of the Oracle, brought to life by Gloria Foster. It's a small but pivotal role that could have easily turned into the loose thread that pulled this movie apart. Foster's performance makes sure this one stays tied together. Hers is the hingepin scene in this  movie, and the writing held everything together (remember, &quot;there is no spoon&quot;).
006016848X|5.0|Men and women have been made different. Congratulations, you might say. Welcome to the world. While everyone knows there are (vast, huge, gulf-like) differences between the sexes, few are able to put their finger on what it is that makes them not always get along. Gray does a marvelous job in this book, and it comes down to this: too often the communication lines are down. I really like what Gray had to say about how to better understand what your partner is made up of and the patterns of thinking. I would have to say this is the best book on communication that I have ever read. He gives many examples to support his points and makes for interesting reading. I especially enjoyed the charts where he gives the right thing (and wrong thing) to say in response to a question or comment. I recommend this book especially for younger couples, even for those who are not yet married.
0553212443|5.0|In his 'A Christmas Carol', Dickens seems to be sending a message of gratefulness for us having to celebrate Christmas Day once a year inspite of the bitterness, sadness and hatred we sometimes feel the whole year round. Just the thought of having Christmas itself is enough reason for us to be thankful and to forgive and forget, Dickens seems to be saying. <br />Also in this book, Dickens seems to be telling grown-ups to take care of the children. Ebenezer Scrooge has an axe to grind with the world with all he had experienced in his childhood and early adulthood. Who would not feel the same way as Scrooge after all what his early life had offered him? As when the Ghost of Christmas Past is showing to Scrooge the school scene when all young Scrooge's classmates have left for the Holidays and Scrooge's younger sister is trying to make him come home, too, but he is not inclined to do so. Dickens was constantly haunted by his traumatic experiences as a little lonely boy working in a blacking factory in industrial-age London. Dickens knew he lost a significant part of his life -- his childhood -- that he seemed to have brezzed by it straight into adulthood. He knew how important childhood experiences were as foundation of everybody's personalities that he seemed he wouldn't want other children to experience the hardships he went through as a child. And, through his 'Carol', Dickens has forever reminded adults about this particular sentiment of his.<br />Dickens shows us how the love of money, the root of all evil, transformed a bitter, vengeful Scrooge to an old, cold man. One very poignant, heart-breaking scene of the story is when Arabella, young man Scrooge's object of affection, explains how, because of Scrooge's yearning to become financially successful in her eyes, she feels like somebody has replaced her in Scrooge's heart.<br />Embedded in the story is the Biblical promise of redemption and salvation once a man has been born again like a child. Indeed, Scrooge, at the end of the story, on Christmas Day, feels like he's little again when he realized that there is still a chance for him to change his ways after the visit of the last specter, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come. <br />If there is one book that should be read during Christmastime by both grown-ups and children, it is this book , 'A Christmas Carol'. Charles Dickens has, indeed, given us an eternal Christmas gift.
6304806434|4.0|Cage is a ex ranger, busted for protecting his girlfriend. Now, a bunch of crinminals is being transfered in a plane, called &quot;Jailbird&quot; and Poe takes a ride. Only he is on his way home, when Cyrus the Virus (Malkovich) and his buddies (Vingh Rhames, Steve Buscemi..) take over the plane in an attempt to retain their freedom. Chasing the bird are John Cusack as U.S. Marshal Larkin and a D.E.A agent, portrayed by Colm Meany.  Sounds like the plot of a cheap B-Movie? Well, it is! And guess what... Poe's girlfriend is having a baby which is being born while he's in prison. Why do I give this movie 4 stars??? Because in action movies,you can compensate the lack of plot with spectacular, eye-popping action sequences and fine actors who help making the story believable.Nick Cage is playing pretty much the coolest guy on the planet, which sometimes seems a little ridiculous and John Malkovich, what do I need to say? He is the perfect cast for the bad guy because he plays his roles so theatrical, which does give the movie something fresh.   The rest of the cast is perfect and espescially Buscemi, psycho as usual, has some of the funniest scenes of the movie. After the fight the action continues to the most electrifying crash landing I've seen as the Jailbird lands. Mark Mancinaand Trevor Rabin composed an energy-packed music score which never lets go and LeAnne Rimes' &quot;How do I live&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs to appear in a happy end of a movie.Dianne Warren has written it and even got an Academy Award nomination for it... So fasten your seatbelts, turn off your thinking and enjoy the ride. Cause that what it's all about. A fun ride!
B00004XONN|5.0|I found this album beatifully haunting, but as we all expected it turned out to be the biggest hype of the year. To me it's all about the music, not just because it's radiohead i'm going to listen to it. I understand a lot of people are disappointed with the new direction of the band, but let me tell you Kid A is one of the most crafted albums i've ever heard, it hooked me on the first listen. Its not like OK computer at all but that's fine, we all knew that anyway. Most of the songs in here will play constantly in your head and you'll live through them, really. The only one im having trouble understanding is the title cut, but the rest.. brilliant. I'd like to know what's gonna happen with the other songs recorded like: knives out, lift, true love waits, pyramid song. They deserve being on an album cause they are amazing.
0385421982|4.0|Much can be said about John Grisham, but I will always defend for being one of the best suspense writers ever.<br />'The Pelican Brief' is another example for that. It's hard to ignore the awesome movie and not to think of Roberts and Washington, but when doing it, you have a lot of fun. The book is much more provocative and has a lot of suspense. It's the typical page-turner, a book hard to put away.<br />This is not his best book, but it's one his real good ones.
6305807086|2.0|The only reason I give the movie 2 stars is for originality.  But at what price?  The characters are completely unlikable.  The plot is much smaller than I had hoped.  And let's face it, it was just plain stupid.  Blech.
B00004Z459|4.0|It's got the grooves and the heavy guitar, it has the sheer volume and enough hip-hop influences to make it just so slightly from Deftones. Listen to the huge drums on 'A Place for my Head', the thudering on 'Points of Authority' ... Linkin Park can get my attention, but who knows if they'll hold it...
B00004Y7SF|5.0|CHRISTINA AGUILERA IS THE BEST. THIS IS A GREAT CHRISTMAS ALBUM! I WENT TO HER CONCERT AT &quot;SUMMER FEST&quot; IN MILWAUKEE, WISCONSIN. I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT SHE IS GREAT, CHRISTINA AGUILERA IS THE NEW POP STAR DIVA. SHE HAS A MAGNIFICENT VOICE. I AM THE #1 FAN OF CHRISTINA IN PUERTO RICO.<br />I ALSO RECOMMEND THESE TITLES: &quot;PASIONAL&quot; BY JESSICA CRISTINA, &quot;GIVE ME JUST ONE NIGHT: UNA NOCHE&quot; BY 98 DEGREES, &quot;SWEET KISSES&quot; BY JESSICA SIMPSON, &quot;I WANNA BE WITH YOU&quot; BY MANDY MOORE, &quot;WHERE YOU ARE&quot; [SINGLE] BY JESSICA SIMPSON AND NICK LACHEY, &quot;MY NAME IS JOE&quot; BY JOE, &quot;ETERNO&quot; BY LUIS FONSI AND &quot;MI REFLEJO&quot; BY CHRISTINA AGUILERA.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|this music is intended to add another dimension to the movie, dancer in the dark.  i just saw the movie this weekend, and it was probably the most emotionally exhausting two hours and twenty minutes i've spent in recent memory.  although this music is beautiful, and i fell in love with it without seeing even a trailer for the film, it is meant to be experienced in the movie.  find out where this film is playing, forget what you're doing and go see it.  you'll either love it or hate it, but i guarentee you will walk out of the theater feeling more accomplished, even jaded, than when you walked in. and much of the plot is simply unbelievable to the audience, in terms of logic, but you're so emotionally turned on you won't even realize how much of a fantasy it really is until you leave the theater, and you start trying to tell yourself what the hell you just experienced.  its like nothing you've ever seen.  and bjork's in it, so get up, free yourself from your computer and tv and school or work and divulge yourself selma's world.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|On My Kind of Christmas, Christina shows a side that she's only dreamed of showing in the past.  Bottom line:  this is a different kind of Christmas album.  It isn't popsy or ditsy.  It is a blend of heavy vocals, stunning gospal, and sausy R&amp;B beats (believe it or not).  Listening to every song is like setting out on an expedition, because they all are very powerful.  Completely breaking tradition, My Kind of Christmas is definitely not the kind of CD you want running while sitting down to eat a quiet Christmas dinner, but it is definitely an album worth owning.
0446672653|1.0|The author helped the woman patient to overcome many of her phobias.  However, he intruded into her personal life when he concluded that two of his patients seemed to have shared many lives together--let's see what happens if I get them together in the same room....  I have read that with enough prodding patients will believe they are remembering anything that it is sugessted to them....   I hate it when women have to sacrifice so much and it is never worth it!  Yes, it is never worth it. Men are so used to have women slaving for them like zombies with no will to unite and overthrow the REAl ENEMY.  It is never 50/50. Women have the hardest part thank you very much, mothernature! This book is another romantic fiction that serves to program women to be mindless [objects]. Men never fall in love, they fall in lust.  So, are soulmate marriages any less painful than the average deal?  What happened to these two &quot;soulmates&quot;?  Did they lived happily ever after?
1878424319|5.0|I've been poring through books about personal growth for years and I've found that if a book doesn't touch me, as in actually make me feel more alive, then all the words and ideas are just words and ideas.  So when I read a review of Don Miguel Ruiz's \\"THE FOUR AGREEMENTS\\" where the reviewer actually said it felt good to read, I knew it was a book for me.  The book is like taking a walk with a compassionate shaman who describes and lives simple truths.  I particularly liked a passage on the third agreement (\\"Don't make assumptions\\") in which Ruiz describes a husband and a wife who fall out of relationship not because they don't love each other, but because they make assumptions such as the other member of the couple should be able to read their mind if they really loved them.  How familiar!  It really underscored the value of truthful communication for me.<br />    The same reviewer also recommended \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane.  This is an excellent book about REALLY living your life fully.  And a perfect example of how the words are secondary to the feeling of well-being that jump off this book's pages.  Thank you, kind reviewer, for two great gifts.
B000000W5P|5.0|I cannot believe that people would be so tone-def as to say this album is overrated.  I, on the other hand, tend to think that Some Girls is one of their best albums ever.  Beast of Burden is something that should bring tears to the eyes of anyone that can appreciate music.  For big rock stars, The Rolling Stones sure can add diversity in a lot of ways to their music.  Well done guys!!!
B00004XONN|5.0|This CD was *amazing*! I actually like it more than &quot;OK Computer.&quot; The music is truly ineffably beautiful...so it's obviously hard to write something specific about it...but I'll give an attempt:<br />This record is soft (for the most part) and filled with random sounds, which gently coalesce together or strikingly contrast against one another...all to provide the listener with an intensely beautiful mix of sounds.<br />There are just so many beautiful nuances...the sound of violins in &quot;How To Disappear Completely&quot; and the &quot;jazz&quot; in &quot;The National Anthem.&quot;<br />Of course, like any other Radiohead album, everything fits together into haunting beauty.<br />Sure, Thom Yorke's voice seems to be downplayed in this album...which is definitely a bold move...but allows the listener to focus on the melody.<br />For some reason, Radiohead has the ability to put unique notes, keys, abstractions, noises, and thoughts into their music, and make it beautiful. With that thought, this album really isn't too far away from its predecessors. Kid A, like the others, is no disappointment, and a huge success. <br />It probably won't be as monumental as &quot;OK Computer&quot;...but is at least as good of an album.<br />-Lindsay-
015626224X|4.0|Ostensibly a novel, this book is Orwell's thinly fictional account of a time he spent &quot;slumming it&quot; in Paris and London. Orwell had read and greatly admired Jack London's book, &quot;People of the Abyss&quot; (1902), which chronicled his time spent among the wretched poor of London at the turn of the century. In the prewar '30s Orwell followed London's journalistic example, and voluntarily entered the ranks of the barely surviving in Paris. His account is rich in it's evocation of sights, sounds, and characters of this day-to-day existence. When he isn't unemployed and pawning his clothes, he works 12-18 hour days as a &quot;plongeur&quot; (dishwasher/gopher) at various hotels and restaurants. It's a pretty awful never-ending cycle of poverty to be caught in, as Orwell's books amply demonstrates. He ends his Paris section by speaking directly to the reader about the reasons for such poverty. Rather than claim any kind of nobility in  poverty, he points out that the terrible jobs he and his friends perform are largely useless work and can be easily made obsolete. Later he moves over to London and joins the ranks of the homeless tramps. This section is less vivid and strong, and is better as a simple sociological study of homelessness in Edwardian England. He somewhat awkwardly inserts a lot of info about slang which is interesting, but somewhat tangential. The extreme policies he decries here have been replaced by the modern welfare state economy. Altogether, it's an interesting journalistic/sociological exercise with some strong statements.
6305537550|5.0|Halloween is hands down the greatest horror movie of all time, and, in my opinion, the best movie of all time from any genre.  I am a horror movie buff, and this is the movie which started it all for me.  Though there is a lack of blood and nudity, which are the two greatest parts of a horror movie, as we all know, Halloween makes up for it in sheer suspense.  While it may not be the scariest movie ever, I have explained many times to many people that the knowledge of the existence of the Shape is enough to create a scare.  In short, this is the best movie ever.
0792107683|5.0|Along with &quot;High noon&quot;,&quot;The magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;The  wild bunch&quot;,&quot;Shane&quot; is one of the most definitive westerns  ever,and also obviously one of the best.The story is both simple and powerful - the land-hungry ranchers intimidating the powerless farmers and then good gunman Shane helps the farmers while bad Gunman Jack Wilson helps the ranchers - and is the quintessential struggle between good and evil.The first 2 fist fights are in my opinion among the best ever in any film.As well as this,we see at the end Shane's prowess as a gunman.And his immortal words - a gun is a tool,as good or bad as the man using it - earlier.  The story of &quot;Shane&quot; and indeed the character Shane have been reproduced to some extent in many other Westerns,including &quot;Pale rider&quot;,&quot;Unforgiven&quot; and differently in &quot;The magnificent seven&quot;. Even non-westerns/neo-westerns like &quot;Mad max 2&quot; share a similar storyline.  Basically,this is one of the films that set the standard for many westerns and other action films to come.
B00001NFCY|2.0|I will admit that at first, I was a Creed fan.  I have My Own Prison, and even though it's a bit cheesy, I liked it because it rocked and was pretty good.  Then I heard the song Higher and I figured that it was a really good song and got Human Clay a little over a year ago.  I couldn't get into it but I tried to convince myself it was good.  Well looking back I know why I couldn't get into it.  It's total and utter crap.  From track 1 to the end, all the songs sound exactly the same.  Scott Stapp's lyrics are horrible and he needs to quit Veddering about how gray and dark everything is, because then he mentions something about God (Come on, Creed is such a Christian band, they're an embarassment to all the good, upstanding, religious bands of the world by denying it) and tries to be inspirational.  It's sickening.  Really, I wouldn't despise it as much if all the stupid people of the world didn't think that this was the greatest thing ever.  It's not good.  It sure as hell isn't innovative.  It's incredible how people don't realize how much they sound like what would happen if you put Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Stone Temple Pilots in a blender and got some brown disgusting goo that not mixed together was made of some pretty damn good elements.  I give it a star because they tried and I guess some people like it, even if I can't for the life of me see why.
B00000DG1R|4.0|When I first got this album, I had been wondering about whether it was worth it or not as I am not a Duran Duran fan and I'm still not. Well, I found the songs on this album quite good and occasionally a bit annoying (no offence intended) but overall this is a good album. Ordinary World is quite nice, but truly I liked The Reflex as well as Rio and Hungry Like The Wolf. If you are into 80s bands as well as music, this can be a pretty good album choice. The thing it lacks is actually lyrics and the album cover is pretty confusing but overall, this is a good album to take home.
B000002TLX|5.0|If you were a fan of Endless Summer Nights, Hold on to the Nights, as well as Right Here Waiting, this album is just perfect for they were all by the same artist: Richard Marx. Sadly, I believe that Richard Marx deserved better fame than many singers out there, he is perhaps the best of lyrics writers and his soft piano music is very relaxing to the ear whether you are a fan of rock or just slow music. One of the unknown works, Angel's Lullaby is a really nice and sweet song. If you are into slower music, this is a very nice album to take home and listen.
B000000OSO|5.0|People always don't want to hear any ballads in a hard-rock band's album.Alright, let's say: it's ok. it's true. But, however, it's not the case of Aero. You know: Steven's extraordinary talent of making a GOOD &amp; MOVING mellody makes Aerosmith be able to carry the title of &quot; inventer of power ballads&quot;. back to 73, there were never a ballad have  been interpreted with so much POWER as Dream on had,actually,Tyler taught the world how to express one's willing and feeling. and of course, the PB always forms a fundamental part of the history of AEro. Ofcourse Aero's hard-rock is among the very best of the planet, but you can't deny that they can do good ballads,too.It's not sell out,they do it just cos they are gifted. So, don't make me laught of saying in a Aero album there should not be any ballads.(however,I'm a hard-rock lover)
0812550706|5.0|A classic in the genre. Not only is this a Hugo and Nebula award winner (along with its sequal), but it is exceptional even among the other winners over the years. Card writes about a young boy being groomed to be the next Napolean, a master strategist and savior of humanity.<br />Not only is the book well written, the characters are deep and meaningful, they are tied together in a tight, well woven story and Card doesn't shy away from several moral issues that might have gotten in the way of a lesser writer.<br />If you liked this book and are looking for more of Card's work, try the &quot;sequel&quot; &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; and his fantasy trilogy &quot;The Tales of Alvin Maker&quot; which starts with &quot;Seventh Son&quot;. All are equally brilliant.<br />Unfortunately Card never quite matches the power of these 5 books (the two Ender books and the Alvin Maker books) although he tries several times, including sequals to all of these. The next one to come along worth reading is probably &quot;Pastwatch&quot;.<br />For authors who are similar, try Dan Simmons's &quot;Hyperion&quot;, another great work that is remenecent of Card's books.
0679879269|5.0|Ok, first thing to say would be, if you haven't read the other books, you have to read them before you read this.  This is an excellent book.  The mystery that leaves you hanging at the end of The Subtle Knife is solved a couple of chapters into The Amber Spyglass, but I won't post any spoilers here.  This book follows the adventures of Will and Lyra on the final stretch of their quest, bringing new characters, adventures, and tragedies.  Along with all of these though come new discoveries as well.  And it is so suspensful, with many surprises that alter some of what readers thought they knew in the first two books.  With Lyra's trip to the Land of the Dead, friends gone by are remembered and seen briefly once more.  One thing I will say though, is that if you didn't like the religious content of the book's prequels, you may find this one a bit slower, because it focuses much more on religious connections.  But it still is interesting and exciting, and will have you wanting to read more.  Especially when a new light is shown on certain characters.  This is a definite buy, especially if you liked The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife.  It is an excellent ending to the trilogy.
0553288105|3.0|I originally picked up this book because I was working my way through a list of double winners, books that had won the Hugo and Nebula awards in a single year. The list is exclusive, and Azimov is one of only a handful of people to accomplish this (Orson Scott Card - twice, Ursula LeGuin - twice, Arthur C. Clarke - twice, David Brin, Joe Haldeman and William Gibson are the others that I know of).<br />Having read Clarke's &quot;Randezvous With Rama&quot; and Card's &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Speaker fo the Dead&quot;, I thought that &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; was going to be a great book. It was good, but my expectations were too high.<br />I like Azimov's writing style, he isn't a literary giant, but he knows this and is intelligent enough not to try. He places an excellent mix of pace, simplicity and plot to carry the book along nicely. I found that the book depends a little too heavily on one plot trick that I guessed early on. This marred the overall impact of the book, but didn't destroy it.<br />The book fully deserves the 3 stars I gave it and maybe more depending on how you like Azimov. If you loved the book and want something similar, you can't go wrong with most of Arthur C. Clarke's material, especially &quot;Randezvous with Rama&quot; which I mentioned earlier. Also, Azimov's &quot;Foundation&quot; books are written in a similar style and carry about the same weight.

0671042858|3.0|Trisha McFarland is a 9-year-old girl who goes on a hike with her brother, Pete, and her mom, who is determined to spend the weekend with her kids.  Trisha's parents recently divorced, and her brother is constantly feuding with his mom.  In an attempt to avoid the spiteful quarrel between her brother and mother, Trisha steps off the trail to go to the bathroom.  She falls behind and then tries to catch up by attempting a shortcut, but becomes lost in a wilderness maze full of peril and terror.<br />Trisha's odyssey succeeds on several levels.  She descends into hallucinations of her beloved Red Sox baseball pitcher Tom Gordon.  For solace she tunes her Walkman to broadcasts of Boston Red Sox baseball games and follows the gritty performances of her hero.  But when her radio's reception begins to fade, Trisha imagines that Tom Gordon is with her and protecting her from an enemy who has left a trail of slaughtered animals and mangled trees in the dense, dark woods.<br />Although I have never been much of a Stephen King fan, I decided to read The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon because it seemed appealing and related to my English theme of survival.  I must say that King does a remarkable job of showing how Trisha's anxiety over her situation slowly begins to escalate, and how the time alone in the woods begins to affect her mentally.  He also does a wonderful job of making a complex, believable character out of a simple 9-year-old.  Another pleasant aspect of the book is that it is very feminist, being that Trisha is the sole character throughout almost the whole story.  She is determined and resourceful and easy to root for in her quest to survive.<br />Unfortunately, though, the book leaves much to be desired.  My dissatisfaction with the book began with the plot.  It started out slow and monotonous, but with hopes it would pick up, I kept reading only to find that it indeed did not.  The story simply goes on too long and begins to seem repetitive after awhile.  Trisha continually falls down, runs the wrong way, etc.<br />Another negative factor of the book is that King is characterized as the master of terror.  Although I was hesitant about reading this book because I feared it would be too scary, when I finally decided it would be appropriate, I was expecting a thrill.  Sadly enough, I was disappointed to find that there was almost no terror portrayed in the story.  It was very difficult to relate to the story, and, because of its absurdity, I found the novel to become boring and strung-out.<br />I have taken into consideration that I have not always been fond of King's style of writing; therefore, I may not be the best critic of his work.  But having read many books in the past, I feel that this novel was not very well written or organized in a suspenseful, interesting manner.  I must credit Stephen King for his attempts to create such a novel, but it was disheartening to find that he had to spoil what could have been a good story line.e.  Trisha continually falls down, runs the wrong way, etc.        <br />Another negative factor of the book is that King is characterized as the master of terror.  Although I was hesitant about reading this book because I feared it would be too scary, when I finally decided it would be appropriate, I was expecting a thrill.  Sadly enough, I was disappointed to find that there was almost no terror portrayed in the story.  It was very difficult to relate to the story, and, because of its absurdity, I found the novel to become boring and strung-out.        <br />I have taken into consideration that I have not always been fond of King's style of writing; therefore, I may not be the best critic of his work.  But having read many books in the past, I feel that this novel was not very well written or organized in a suspenseful, interesting manner.  I must credit Stephen King for his attempts to create such a novel, but it was disheartening to find that he had to spoil what could have been a good story line.
B000002KFJ|5.0|People tend to say that &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; is the most important Black Sabbath record. While I agree that the album is very good and is a total turning point in the band's musical life, &quot;Sabotage&quot; remains as the best Sabbath album for me. See, it is just that I think that &quot;Sabbath Bloody Sabbath&quot; is a bit too prog - rock and is lacking a bit of the hard rock, which is why we're here in the first place... With &quot;Sabotage&quot; the band was smart enough to take in all its new found prog -rock influences, but mix it with a handful of full frontal dose of the good old hard rock, therefore, resulting in a true masterpiece that is by far the highpoint of the classic Sabbath lineup.
6302293553|5.0|simply the greatest movie of all time. if you have not seen it you are stupid and missing out.
B000001DWG|5.0|In the late 1980s hard rock got a bad name for being all about parties and big hair... While a lot of it was true, there were some other bands as well. The band in hand is the perfect exemple for that. Long before all the hype about the music from Seattle, Mother Love Bone was paying tribute to the great hard rock of the 1970s. And the end result was total magic. Take Led Zeppelin, Aerosmith, Elton John, Queen, T Rex and Red Hot Chili Peppers, mix it all together and drink. Enjoy !
0887306101|4.0|I liked Market Wizards the first time I read it.  I read it a second time to figure out what I needed to do to become a successful trader.  Other than reading about trader after trader blowing out big time at least once in their life before hitting the road to success, I found the book enjoyable.  The only real drawback is that it is low on actual usable strategies.  I mean, what I'm looking for is some idea of what these trading gurus are doing to make all their money.  The Best: Conversations with Top Traders, does a good job of presenting more winning strategies to accompany their backstories.  Don't get me wrong though, when it comes down to good old-fashioned stories of rags-to-riches success and kernels of wisdom, Market Wizards is the hands down best.
B000002LQR|5.0|Red Hot Chili Peppers before the album in hand is, for me, a pretty bad band. It seems like they always knew what they wanted to do, but never got around to doing it. and then there's &quot;Bloodsugarsexmagik&quot;.... I won't beat around the bush: I think it's a total masterpiece. Mixing the right dose of sex, gentaleness, funk, rock and rap, the peppers never sounded {or will sound} better than they do on this album.
B00004Z459|4.0|Glassjaw were first for best debut. This album is extremely poppy, and it may appeal to Papa Roach fans, but that does not make it bad. I also want to include that Linkin Park definitely has the best street team in the world (I'm on it, but that's not the point) because when I first heard about them back in May of this year, they were just another no name band, and then October rolls around and their new record is sales rank number 129 on Amazon on the first day. I'm not sure if they're on MTV or the radio, but I have seen a lot of posters and stickers up around LA for them, and I see why. This is a band you'd want to promote. Two rappers/singers, similar to 311 or Linea 77, a DJ/programmer who is fairly good, but needs to work on the programming, a drummer who doesn't suck, his beats are just fine by my standards and this is a high point, and then a guitarist/bassist who plays heavy, Filter-esque riffs to back up the rapping. This all adds up to a pretty unique band, as well as a contract with Warner Brothers and like I said before, a lot of promotion. Never have I seen a band so hyped by media and fans before their debut record even drops. If you want my opinion, yes I'd recommend this album, mainly because it is easy to get into, it's cool, poppy, and has something for everyone on it. There isn't a lot wrong with it besides the programming and production (pretty poor) and is overall a good CD. All of these underground bands keep blowing up, first Papa Roach, then Linkin Park, next it should be Alien Ant Farm, Vent, Hoobustank, or Factory 81, who all recently signed major label contracts. This record is a good buy, if you're into MTV-charged nu-metal. The best songs so far are With You, Papercut, Crawling, and By Myself. Check this out, it's not a bad CD.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is simply a masterpiece.  Many critics wondered what the fab four would come up with next.  The answer - one of rock and roll's greatest albums ever.  This album without a doubt takes you on a journey like never before.  The Beatles take on alter egos and perform on this album with sheer brillance.  From the opening song &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band,&quot; to the end &quot;A Day In The Life,&quot; this album is packed with wonderful arragements and production wizardry.  Is Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds a drug song?  What exactly does John want to turn us on to?  This is the first album where the Beatles blantently express drug references instead of their usual inuendos.  All grown up, the Beatles have filled this album with humorous and serious tones, which make this album absolutely incredible.  Why do the Beatles hold that last chord for 53 seconds?  Is it really a concept album?  Find out for yourself with this magical piece of rock and roll history.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|This is a typical Christina CD...same beat as her other records just Christmas lyrics.  Should be a wonderful seller for the 13-14 year olds, but not worth listening to if you truly want some traditional Christmas musc. Christina has an amazing vocal range as evidenced by her blues rendition of an Etta James song in her concert. One of these years she will grow up and use the full potential of her voice. This was NOT it.
B00000K0DT|5.0|This is a movie made for intelligent people.  It plays with our perceptions and establishes a mind duel with the audience: will you be able to decipher its plot? Can you guess who Kayser Souze is?  Get ready for top notch performances by the whole cast, especially Kevin Spacey and fellow Puerto Rican Benicio del Toro.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Yes. You will have to find out for yourself. I'm not going to tell you how brilliant Bjork is, as you've heard it from numerous reviewers below. I dare you to pop in Selmasongs, listen to 107 Steps, and NOT tremble. Be a hunter. Go out and find this CD. Ordering it may take to darn long. You scatterheart...<br />You are going to have to find out for yourself...
B00004T8RK|2.0|Yes, the guys are soo lazy to come up with any really good material. Till No code, they were very very good, even though most people dissed no code, i still liked it very much. But Yield (and now Binaural) are just very mediocre efforts. Binaural has a good set of songs till track 6 (Thin air), then off the girl, and thats it. The other songs are really unlistenable. The sad thing too is that the listenable songs dont have a lasting effect, and you can see for yourself, how often do you play yield now as oppossed to any of its predecessors? People keep saying that pearl jam are just great because they refuse to come up with an album like Ten. I dont think they 'refuse'...they just cant do it again, thats all. Look at some guy like stone gossard, the guy who almost single handedly wrote the ten album, all he has on the new record is three songs, 2 of them are JUST ok, and one is trash 'rival'. They just cant make it again, and this is passed off as experimentation, every single PJ album has been worse than the one before it (except for this one and yield, i listened to yield only 20 or 30 times then i gave it to a friend for good). Pearl jam just lost it (or are losing it, because they still have killer tracks on this album such as god's dice/breakerfall) I just dont know why people are waiting on them all that long. I will still buy all their coming albums, and i got 3 of their recently released live recordings, but w/ every album...i keep hoping they'll have something that was life-changing as daughter/sometimes/corduroy/porch or whatever, but they dont.
0790734443|4.0|This isn't Batman or Batman Returns but it is very entertaining and fun to watch. You can't blame Joel Schumacher for going for a more crowd-pleasing and fun approach, like 2OO1 going to 2O1O and OHMSS going to Diamonds are Forever. This is a good movie for several reasons. The Oscar nominated photography is very well-done and revolutionary especially the during the building jump and BatWing sequences. The special effects are incredible. The sound is perfectly done also. Watch this you wont be disappointed
B000001FY9|5.0|The songs speak for themselves -- and all the best ones are on this CD. If you're not familiar w/Bob Marley, this is THE best introduction you'll find.
0688172377|5.0|Waris Dirie tells us the extraordinary story of her life, beginning as a nomad in Africa, her escape on foot thru the desert from the prospect of an arranged marriage, going first to the city where her sister lived, then to England, where she knew not a word of the language, and finally to America.  She became an internationally famous model, learned to speak English, got married, divorced, and remarried, and finally became a spokeswoman for the United Nations against female genital mutilation.    The story of her life is fascinating, but the genital mutilation she and her sisters suffered is disgusting.  Dirie relates that no man of her native culture would want to marry a woman who had not been mutilated in such a way as to make it impossible for her to feel the intense pleasure of sexual intercourse.  Thus mutilated, she supposedly cannot be tempted by other men.  Many young girls die from infections contracted from unsanitary instruments used in this barbarous procedure.    Both men and women there are really missing out on the joy they could have, were men to give women the respect they deserve.  Such a man may experience orgasm, but he can never experience the far greater joy of knowing that he has given the greatest and most intense pleasure to someone he deeply loves and respects.  If I were married to a woman so mutilated, I would feel sorely cheated because I could never give her the pleasure I would want her to have.  Like the Texas oilman who married a much younger wife and was warned that she would soon take on other lovers, I would rather own five percent of a gusher than lock, stock, and barrel of a dry hole.    I hope Dirie's husband will always be loving, thoughtful, and kind to her, because after the hell she has been thru, she deserves all the happiness he can give her, and then some.  Her story is an inspiration, but at the same time it is a challenge to the rest of us to do what we can to end the horrible practise of female genital mutilation.watziznaym@gmail.com
B00004WKII|5.0|I just bout this tresure of a box set,it is full of outtakes and music i never knew excisted. If you are a jimi hendrix fan you have to get this set.It has a book inclouded that has a lot of rare photos and info in it. Enjoy
B00004YA66|5.0|I dare anybody to watch this entire movie with a dry eye,its very touching especially to those who have lost loved ones at a young age. The movie travels at high speed never letting up till the credits start rolling.The low down on the film is this, John Sullivan a young imbittered cop (played flawlessly by James Caviezel who in my opinion is an actor with unbridled talent and ability who keeps impressing me in each movies he's in) is able to come in contact with his father over an old ham radio his father (played by Dennis Quaid who is at his best in this film)thirty years in the past by a freak electrical storm which occuring at the same time in the past. I don't want to give to much away but it gets into the whole theory of time travel and the paradoxs that could occur if someone meddles in the past, one tiny little eventcould be catastrophic to the future and so forth. This film is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to everybody.
630472229X|4.0|Just as &quot;Aliens&quot; was a departure from the original,&quot;Alien 3&quot; has elements of the last two films but manages to work as an independent work with characteristics of it's own.<br />People who hate this film were obviously expecting another blast-the-aliens away-marines fest like &quot;Aliens&quot;.Well,that has now been attempted in &quot;Alien Ressurrection&quot; and it turned out terribly.Personally,I would prefer a film trilogy with each film having it's own atmosphere and concepts,rather than a monotonous continuation (eg Back to the Future series).Alien 3 is a stylish,gloomy and fascinating addition to the series,and a logical conclusion.<br />It may not be a perfect film like it's predessesors but people who think it's not worthy of the series obviously don't  understand the Alien saga.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Wait, didn't I just hear this album? Oh, that's right. This one's new. Fred Durst and his bandmates certainly have pulled off another one, and when I say &quot;another&quot; I really mean &quot;another album that they know before it hit the shelves that it will go at least triple platinum.&quot; A GREAT EXERCISE IN BS AND GIVING THE MASSES EAR CANDY INSTEAD OF REALLY TRYING TO GO SOMEWHERE WITH THEIR MUSICALITY, WHICH IS ACTUALLY PRETTY ORIGINAL.<br />Also, the songs on this album are WAY overproduced. There isn't a second in &quot;Rollin'&quot; where I don't hear Fred Durst saying something. Hey Fred, here's a tip: SHUT UP! LET THE MUSIC SAY SOMETHING FOR ONCE! WE DON'T HAVE TO HEAR YOUR VOICE EVERY SECOND OF THE ALBUM!
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok all you half to get this album it is so hardcore and the lyrics are so hard too. The music part of it is awsome the turntables got great with the great gutair sound, awsome bass beats, and great drum rythem. GET THIS ALBUM one of the best if not the best of 2k look for this band in concert and MTV in the future they will be all over.
B000002BE9|4.0|Fiona Apple has a unique and seductive voice that will draw in a listener to her unique sound.  This CD highlights her low, earthy unique singing voice and is delightful to listen to.  My favorite on this CD is &quot;Criminal&quot; in which she confesses that she has been a &quot;bad bad girl&quot; and another great song is &quot;The First Taste&quot;, when reading the verses of her songs, the listener can tell that she writes about her own experiences and her emotion in these are evident.<br />Fiona Apple has been accused of being to serious about things and for creating a stir at public events, well I can neither praise her or condemn her, all I can do is enjoy her songs and the way she presents herself, and I believe she does quite well in both.
0782006809|4.0|&quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; may not be quite as good as &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; and &quot;Lover Come Back&quot;, the Stanley Shapiro scripted comedies that preceeded it, but it's still a delightful comedy romp.<br />&quot;Mink&quot; was the second biggest moneymaking film of 1962 and the first film to gross more than a million dollars at NYC's Radio City Music Hall. (Eventually it grossed nearly 2 million dollars during it's record breaking run there).<br />It's glossy and slightly improbable, but the dream pairing of Cary Grant and Doris Day, both masters of sophisticated comedy, smooth over many of the rough edges.  They are assisted by a wonderful supporting cast including Gig Young, Audrey Meadows, and John Astin, among others.<br />Doris is splashed by Cary's limo, which sets up a merry &quot;battle of the sexes&quot; as Cary vigorously pursues Doris, who receives dry advice from roomie Meadows, who works in a New York City automat. The premise is simple but the writing is sharp and often hilarious and the settings are lush and picturesque, as the pair twice go to Bermuda, as well as visit the United Nations, a Yankees game, and a place called Al's Motel!!<br />The film won a Golden Globe as Best Comedy of the year and that was due, in large part, to the stylish manner in which the cast made the situations come alive.<br />At 58, Grant is still the master of the suave and sophisticated line.  Nobody before or since can inhabit a role like Grant. Day more than holds her own against Grant showing brilliant comic timing, especially in a scene where she becomes inebriated and falls out of a hotel window.  Her double takes are classic.<br />Sure it can be dismissed as &quot;fluff&quot; but it's of such a high quality that it can be enjoyed for what it is.  Every film doesn't need to challenge the viewer or be analyzed for some hidden message. &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; provides a cargo of laughs and that's all it sets out to do. On that level it succeeds admirably!rably!
B000005H3A|5.0|This is Herbie Hancock's first recording as a leader and it is impressive to say the least.  From &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; to the alternate take of &quot;Empty Pockets&quot;, Hancock shows listeners why he is considered one of the giants of Jazz.  He shows his unique style on this 1962 album (CD), and just to think, he just got started!  In a few years, he would join Miles Davis and become a member of one of the most famous quintets in Jazz History.  It is easily apparent to see why Miles Davis was impressed with Hancock, and that itself was a difficult task, since Davis was very selective in who he wanted in his group.  &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; is a selection that is just as fresh today as when it was first recorded 38 years ago, and the other works on this album (CD) are just as outstanding.<br />Highly recommended to all Jazz enthusiasts, it is well worth 5 stars (and more).
0062502182|5.0|Will what can I say &quot;The Alchemist&quot; avery good book that i racomendto many poeple.
B00004Z459|4.0|That sums it up pretty well. My fav song is 2, 3 is also really good.  As far as what bands Linkin sounds like- I would say a cross between Limp Bizket and Incubus, little deftones thrown in as well.  For the money you wont go wrong with this CD.
B000002V07|5.0|If you like either of the other Mazzy Star albums, this one is a little different... in a better way.  If you have never heard of this band, but like mysterious, sultry, and deep music, running the gamut from acoustic guitar with female voice, ranging to psychedelic electronic, then maybe it's for you.<br />This is the best of all Mazzy Star's albums.  I really wish the group would stick with this style, which is a little darker at times, and a little more acoustic at others, than either 'Swan or 'Brightly.  There is only one song on this album (track 2) which I do not truly adore (and it just happens to be the one song which sounds EXACTLY like most of the songs on the other 2 albums).<br />The sound on this album reminds me in an odd way of early Pink Floyd and The Doors, with a sultry female vocalist.  It makes great mood music for a make out session.  It is good for combating depression.  Then again, it also gets me riled up.  The title track makes think of what would happen if Jim Morrison was reincarnated as a woman and tried to play &quot;The End&quot; in the 90's.  &quot;5 String Serenade&quot; is one of the softest, sweetest, and most gentle songs ever.<br />Also, the recording quality is FANTASTIC!  I use this CD as a test/reference whenever I try out new audio equipment.
0811826848|1.0|Anyone who is even slightly familiar with the Beatles from any number of past books will learn nothing new here. I have never found a Beatles book as boring as this one, I found myself praying the book would end. Paul can put you to sleep with one paragraph, Ringo is forever trying to defend himself as a great drummer (He wasn't even the greatest drummer in the Beatles) and George is so pompous that I stopped reading him about halfway through to get to the end more quickly.<br />Anyone who wants to know the real story of the Beatles would be far better served by  &quot;The lives of John Lennon&quot; by Albert Goldman.
B000001FA4|5.0|This is the album that firmly established the U2 sound.  The haunting, ringing guitar of the Edge gained its substance and myth here.  Arguably, Bono gives his BEST vocal performance on this album - his range flowing from falsetto to whisper to scream almost effortlessly.  From the opening guitar journey tranced on &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot; to the harbored pain and anguish of &quot;Bad&quot; to the unbridled hope of &quot;MLK&quot; - this CD set the stage for what was to come.  Without &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot;, U2 would never have pushed themselves to the spiritual heights of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; or the reverb and revolution of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;.  It was a risk that paid off and truly launched their carreer.
B000002KDI|5.0|I've been buying Neil Young's records and CDs for a long time, and this is the best one, and the one I reach for most.  11 great tracks out of 16.  Cortez, Powderfinger and Hurricane are awesome.  On the back of the CD is a picture of a Jimi badge on a guitar strap.  These guys earned the badge with this CD.  If you were going to get just one Neil Young CD, there is not a better intro to him.  Then get After the Gold Rush.
630588255X|5.0|I don't give big 'inflated' reviews.  This is because I hate to read one -and then get the film, and see how disappointing it really is.  But in this film's case, I don't know how to describe it with words.  It will make you feel alive in so many ways, you can't count them.<br />This film should be sub-captioned 'Question authority, question your whole life!' It is hysterically funny, tragically sad, and filled with soul.  So many subjects are explored so deeply...after you watch it, you'll be astonished that they packed all of this in, without the movie taking 6 hours.<br />It opens your mind and your heart.  You'll have entirely new points of view regarding religion, family pressure, intergenerational love affairs, death, societal position, and the meaning of life itself.  Before I go too far with this, I'll stop.  (like I said, I'd hate to dissapoint you in the end).<br />Suffice it to say that it will be in your top 20 films list for the rest of your life (maybe your top 10).<br />The only comparable films I can think of are American Beauty, Lolita, and Office Space.  But they're quite different from this one, while exploring many of the same themes.<br />Its a &quot;wow&quot; !<br />    - Jeff
B00003CXDG|3.0|I thought this movie copied &quot;the Matrix&quot;, &quot;James Bond&quot; and almost every other kick em' up shoot em' up action film out there.  The first one was much better, this one was more for the use of shooting, blowing up, kicking, and fighting. it's just your typical action flick, nothing spectacular.  It's worth seeing at least once, but just know it's nothing like the first one.  Much more blood/gore.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I thought this cd was cool. I liked the musice,lyrices,&amp; songes.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Forget the witty antics of a Kevin Smith film, leave your logical side at the door, and just enjoy the ride.<br />Tom Green's appearance in the movie, though more of a cameo, adds a subtle and twisted feel as only he can.<br />Viagra, pot, sex, love, fat jokes, blind jokes... by the time you leave, if you havent been offended once, you need to get out more. <br />Definitely a rival to American Pie, I give this movie 5 stars enthusiastically. Deliver this movie already!!  ;)
0790729989|5.0|Calling SEVEN a detective thriller is almost like calling ANNA KARENINA a romance novel.  Still, ostensibly that's what it is.  It deals with the hunt for a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) committing murders based on the seven deadly sins.  The job of finding him falls to two police detectives:  Somerset (Morgan Freeman)- a wise, dignified  but burned-out veteran, literally days from retirement- and his partner, Mills (Brad Pitt)- an impatient, ambitious newcomer.  <br />While SEVEN is a rollercoaster of disturbing surprises, it's hardly just a lurid thrill ride. The final twist is a horrific reminder that murder is a human tragedy and that even ordinary human failings won't escape this killer's fanatically pitiless judgment. There are illustrations throughout of the indifference and dehumanization on which evil thrives- the sex shop owner who casually custom-makes a potentially lethal erotic aid, for example. <br />Be warned: SEVEN is extremely graphic. (At the morgue, for example, you see everything they kept out of frame on QUINCY. And then there's Sloth...)  The visual design creates a fittingly dank, decaying urban environment.  My favorite scene, however, was Somerset doing research after hours at a library while a radio played classical music.  It's a transcendently serene moment in a violent and corrupt world.  <br />There are fine performances.  Although Pitt is well cast and Spacey gives the killer a fine, restrained portrayal, the real screen presences are Gwyneth Paltrow (Mills' wife, Tracy) and Freeman.  Paltrow, of course, is one of the great beauties of our time but Freeman's quiet charisma is amazing.<br />The DVD is somewhat awkward. It must be flipped over. The scene selection feature indexes large chunks (the sins, mostly) not the numbered scenes. While cast bios seem thorough (Freeman was on ELECTRIC COMPANY!), there are no interviews or documentaries.   Still, little can diminish this film's power.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Once more the powerful voice of Johnny Cash does not disappoint.  This CD pulls you through a whirlwind of emotions from the cold chilling sounds of &quot;I see the Darkness&quot; and &quot;Mercy Sea&quot; to the mellow, warm side of love with &quot;One&quot;.  Johnny Cash's music speaks to every man and American III is no exception.  This is a perfect addition to any CD collection and a must have for all Johnny Cash fans.
B00004YLIU|5.0|The sense of a Major Band on a journey that is exceeding expectations recalls the giant steps made with each successive album by The Beatles in the Sixties.   &quot;Idioteque&quot; and &quot;Everything in its Right Place&quot; are two of the best songs they've ever done, easily making this one the must buys of 2000.  The people who don't like it probably think &quot;Creep&quot; was their finest hour.  Listening to it feels totally contemporary but it also has many of the things that made OK Computer so great.  If you're looking for &quot;Karma Police 2&quot; don't bother.  If you're looking for an instant classic, buy this album.
B000002UAR|5.0|Before &quot;Revolver&quot; all popular music was as one - The Beatles, Dylan, The Hollies, Gerry and The Pacemakers etc were all bracketed together.  &quot;Revolver&quot; stood the whole thing on its head and single handedly created Rock and Psychedelia, and from this point on popular music was never the same again. From the effortless grace of &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; to the extreme of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; the album never pauses for breath, and never wants for inventiveness. It was at this point that the Beatles reached the top.
6303014100|4.0|I first saw this film a couple of years ago. It was a great effort to attempt a realistic account of those terrible three days in 1863 when the history of the United States was changed forever. A little slow in parts but this can be overlooked as the battle scenes are extremely well done, although perhaps not as realistic as Saving Private Ryan. Many of the men who survived the battle suffered terrible injuries which left many of them losing limbs, but not their spirit. A must see film if you want to develop some understanding of what Gettysburg was all about. Many good performances from Jeff Daniels, Martin Sheen, and the late Richard Jordan who portrays General Armistead who died two days after the battle.
B00000J6AG|5.0|The album is breathtakingly beautiful with every song a masterpiece on its own. Some people have complained of bad audio quality. Well, if you've seen the MTV VMAs 2000, you'll know that Moby records the albums himself in his bedroom. And to produce an album like this one, that's just brilliant.
0789723107|5.0|As a web designer that owns my own domain, I had purchased Jakob Nielsens Wed Design Usability book and loved it. I thought nothing could top it, but then I was in a book store and picked Don't Make Me Think up. It had some high-power reviews of the book on that back cover. When I opened this book up, I understood why. This book talks about Web Design as and ways to understand why a site needs to be design to the specific user the designer has in mind. <br />Highly respect design expert Roger Black writes the forward. I remember buying a book of his years ago called Websites That Work. While a beautiful book, it was before its time and lacking what Krug has written into this book. I'd recommend this to anyone who has purchased Nielsen's book. It refreshing that there is actually credible suggestion out there.

Both of them wish to leave the warren because of the way they are treated by the Owsla or band of young strong rabbits that steal food from the weak. <br />Watership Down is an exciting read, full of surprises, twists, turns, and terror.  It is one of the best animal books ever written and may have, I believe, inspired some animal novelists like Brian Jacques to start their writing career. <br />Alex Hutter is the writer of Rabbits `r' Us and is currently working on project P.T.R.O.N.A, Protect the Rabbits of North America.
B000006P8I|2.0|David Bowie is a great brand, and it shifts lots of CDs. This is because of a terrifically fertile creative period David Bowie the artiste weathered in the 1970s, all of which was captured in Glorious Stereo by the good folk at RCA, but none of which is represented here. This, instead, is the godawful &quot;Deram&quot; material of the 1960s - which a young and outwardly talentless Davy Jones recorded between leaving school and discovering the Dylan perm. Irrespective of what any of the revisionists say, it is simply not any good. This doesn't stop Decca valiantly trying to flog it off every six months in a different package, of course, a practice they have maintained unstintingly since about 1984.
6304493681|1.0|Mindless animated mush.  How can anime fans not fall asleep?  I'd rather watch THE IRON GIANT.
B00004XQP4|5.0|Warning-  This is a very fitting opening song.  The track warning really shows how different the cd is. After the chorus in this song you can hear a siren going off.  There's a first for everything.  3/5<br />Blood Sex and Booze-  The best song on the cd.  If you like Hitchin' a Ride(Nimrod), you will love this song.  A very nice beat.  5/5<br />Church on Sunday-  This is the most popish song on the cd, but still with a green day/punkrock touch.  Its a pretty good song, but not my favorite on the cd.  4/5<br />Fashion Victim-  A good song.  It has a swing type feel to it.  A very catchy rhythm.  The lyrics make a lot of sense.  &quot;He's a victim of his own time, in his vintage suit and tie&quot;  &quot;What's in a name?&quot;.  5/5<br />Castaway-  A very good song, good beat.  5/5<br />Misery-  Similar to Last Ride In from the album Nirmod, in that they try to do a song from a different culture.  Last Ride in doing a Hawaiin song.  Misery, an italian type song.  This is the most different song on the cd by far.  This song made me miss the Dookie days the most.  Green Day trys too hard to do something different here.  Not a very good song.  2/5<br />Deadbeat Holiday-  This song sounds like it could have been off of Nimrod.  When you hear this song you will probably agree.  Good song.  4/5<br />Hold On-  An intro with a harmonica, a swingish beat, Todo, I don't think we're in Dookie anymore.  If you like change, you will like this song, as well as every other song on this cd.  I happen to think this song is just ok  3.5/5<br />Jackass-  These lyrics are not like most of the lyrics off of this album.  Most of the lyrics are very optimistic and positive, in this song Billie Joe sings about that person who is annoying and how they are a waste of time to listen to.  Good song.  5/5<br />Waiting-  The most optimistic lyrics on the cd.  This is one of my favorite songs on the cd.  5/5<br />Minority-  If you have heard one song from Warning, this is the one.  The opening sounds like a drunk Irish guy playing the acoustic gutiar.  After the intro it breaks out into the most punkish song on the cd.  Very good song.  5/5<br />Macy's Day Parade-  A weaker version of Good Riddance (Time of Your Life).  I would have liked to of seen a better closing song on the cd, but still it isn't a bad song, it just isn't a great song.  3.5/5<br />If your willing to let go of the Kerplunk, Dookie, and Insomniac days, you will love this cd.  For those of you who are too die hard punk fans, and don't like anything a little differnt I don't recommend this cd for you.  I loved it.sounds like a drunk Irish guy playing the acoustic gutiar.

B00004Z4WR|4.0|Gone in 60 Seconds is your typical Jerry Bruckheimer summer action film.  Those looking for a little bit of substance in their film need not apply to this one, audiences who want to grab a bag of popcorn and have some fun, will certainly get their money's worth out of this fast paced 'cartoon.'Calling this film a cartoon may sound like an insult, but with this film, that's not the case.  With this movie, we get loads of colorful characters and some crazy stunt work.  The story is one that you've seen a ton of times previously, and if you haven't it's still predictable.  Randall &quot;Memphis&quot; Reins (Nicolas Cage) is an ex-car thief who once was 'the best' in the business.  Reins is lured back into the business when his dopey brother (Giovanni Ribisi) gets on the bad side of a notorious criminal called 'The Carpenter'.  Reins comes rushing, reluctantly at first, to little brother's aid and in order to have the little man's life spared, Reins, along with his brother, must steal 50 cars in 24 hours for 'The Carpenter' or both of them will be killed.  There's some bits of Reins assembling the old gang he used to steal cars with including the sexy Angelina Jole-an ex-girlfriend with an attitude.  Master actor Robert Duvall is also on hand as the theif's mechanic.  Reins back on his old turf even makes a local gang very unhappy and just for good meausre, we get to see the car thieves dealing with these dopes in a few very amusing scenes.  Another main character is a cop (Delroy Lindo) who sees Reins back in town and vows to catch him this time out.  To this cop, Reins is like Moby Dick, and although this is nothing original, the cat and mouse, hide and seek game played between these two guys is also very fun.Gone in 60 Seconds is concerned less about plot and characters and more about cars and style.  The thing about this movie though, is that for a movie about cars, we only get one car chase.  Granted it is a long and exciting one toward the film's finish, but thoseexpecting this one to be all chase will probably be disappointed.  But, if you're just looking for two hours of escapist fun, this is a really great movie.  There's nothing too special about any of it, but if you know what you're getting into, there's just a general aura of fun about the whole thing.This movie won't appeal to prudish viewers who believe themselves above a silly good time, fans of The Rock and Con Air should have a pretty decent idea of what they're getting into.  Imagine those films, but sillier!  Gone in 60 Seconds IS a fun movie, just turn off your common sense and enjoy the ride.  I'll bet you have a good time.
B000021Y74|5.0|I loved this movie. But do yourself a favor--don't read the other reviews here!  Some of them give away too much; I saw this movie without knowing anything about it (the exact recommendation was &quot;You have to see this movie NOW, and this is now than anything I ever nowed at you before&quot;), and I think that I was more able to enjoy it that way.<br /><br />I'd also like to comment on the fact that, more than in almost any other foreign movie I've ever seen, you forget that you're reading subtitles to the extent that you can almost remember the characters speaking in English afterwards...
B0000019PA|2.0|The sweeping scope of words used in reviews to describe the sounds of Neutral Milk Hotel certainly mislead the average listener.  Neutral Milk Hotel is interesting, complex, and off the beaten path.  However, one would definitely put this album and artist  into the &quot;acquired taste&quot; file.  This by no means detracts from the artist, but &quot;hypnotic, psychadelic, melodic, greatest&quot; etc.- these adjectives should not be used lightly- and are probably not the most appropriate for this album. Listen to samples before you buy to see if it is for you.
B000002L7J|5.0|i got turned on to these guys when i was living in baton rouge, louisiana, by a black woman who was really into alternative music.  then i got my best bud to make me a tape of this album and strangeways, here we come. both are excellent records. this one i really like alot because you really see morrissey's sense of sarcasm and humor coming into bloom.i have never skipped a track since i've started listening to it. best songs are: &quot; the headmaster's ritual,&quot; &quot; i want the one i cant have,&quot; meat is murder &quot; which is noteworthy because it takes on the subject of animal cruelty, and &quot;how soon is now,&quot; which is the ultimate whipped puppy's anthem. such a shame morrissey and marr didn't get along. but the output they created was enough
B00003CX5A|2.0|i'll never never ever ever see it again. ... I am in awe of his visual imagery (though Idon't particularly like his penchant for dark exposures and washed out colors) and I am perplexed at his use of this genius to create such bizarre and twisted films.<br />What is most disturbing about this film is that it tries to pass itself off as being based on Washington Irving's classic short story.  This is not even loosely based on that masterpiece.  It bears no more resemblance to the `Legend of Sleepy Hollow' than Johnny Depp bears to Ichabod Crane.  To put Irving's name and title on this goes beyond artistic license to shameless artistic forgery for its commercial value.  <br />This is not to say that this isn't a good story.  It is an excellent story.  I just object to the artistic deception.  What is sad is that we have a whole generation who will never read the story and believe they know it because they saw this film. <br />That being said, I thought this was a very good film that was a bit too ambitious in trying to cross genres.  Burton attempts to create a comedy horror action adventure mystery romance.  It has too many competing elements that distracted us from the main plot.  The comedy element is the least effective. Burton's wry attempts at humor are sophomoric and puerile and detract from the better elements of the film, namely the horror/mystery aspect.<br />From the standpoint of the sets, props, costumes and visual effects, this film is masterful.  The woods were spooky, the tree of death was fantastic and the windmill was a marvel. The creation of the headless effect was brilliant use of digital technology.  The decapitations were also superbly grisly and realistic.  <br />Johnny Depp did a fine job as the bumbling constable. He played it a bit too tongue in cheeky, but I'm certain that was more Burton's direction than Depp's interpretation.  Christina Ricci was well cast as the coquettish Katrina.  Somehow I don't think she has to stretch much to play the sassy and flirtatious type, but she played it to perfection.<br />I rated this film a 7/10.  It is very entertaining and has moments of brilliance, but overall the whole is less than the sum of the parts.  And Washington Irving it ain't.py  Hollow,&quot; a film that will eventually become a classic in its  genre.Please, if you havn't seen it, run and rent it and if you are lucky  to see it if it comes to your town on the big screen, see it again and just  marvel at this dark and fantastic tale told in wild, beautiful,and stunning  images.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|This is a good sample from Kravitz' five albums.  Like the Guess Who (&quot;American Woman&quot;), Kravitz is one of those artists that Greatest Hits albums were designed for.  If you're like me, you find some of his albums (like I did with the Guess Who) a hit and miss affair.  And with this release we get the hits (and a new song, &quot;Again&quot;).  So here's your chance to relive some of the songs that might not get played as much as &quot;Fly Away&quot; or &quot;It Ain't Over&quot;: stuff like &quot;Believe&quot; or &quot;Always On The Run&quot; and &quot;Heaven Help&quot;.  Sure, you'll find something missing.  I'll trade you &quot;Rock and Roll Is Dead&quot; for &quot;Fields of Joy&quot;.  But that's a minor complaint. Sorry, no liner notes here, but you do get a lot of photos of Kravitz from throughout the years.   This is a solid 62 minutes of Rock-Pop-Funk-Soul.
B000002UEB|4.0|I'm a big fan of progressive music in general, bands like Yes, Gentle Giant, Frank Zappa, King Crimson, Uk, Pink Floyd, (early) Genesis, Rush, The Moody Blues etc.Just recently I've been getting into prog-metal, I was blown away with bands like Tool, Dream Theater and King Diamond, and heard plenty of reviews on this album and gave it a try. I love it to say the least. And highly recomended it to anyone who's a fan of progressive music. Get it, you wont be disappointed!
B00004Y2QT|4.0|To me, until recently Prince's prodigious musical talents have increasingly been obscured by a tiresome string of marketing ploys that go back to the early stages of his career.  Among the examples: the name changes, the CRYSTAL BALL mail-order fiasco, a string of questionable talent/image (Vanity, Apollonia) or miscast talent/image (Sheila E, Sheena Easton) female proteges, a short-lived record label, and a horde of album releases (including many studio outtakes).  It seems like the CD-buying public has grown so tired of the hype that they've turned away from even his better recent albums.  <br />On RAVE UN2 THE YEAR 2000 Prince seems to have taken a forward step by dumping the excess baggage and turning our focus back to his musical skills.  A lot of music fans who have drifted away in recent years may want to climb back on board here with this highly entertaining, fast-paced video (the DVD sounds and looks great, and has bonus features).  Buoyed by fresh performances of mostly his most popular tunes (particularly from the album PURPLE RAIN), Prince seems more than ever like an rejuvenated musical Artist.  Furthermore, he is gracious in his turning the stage over to an impressive list of guest stars, and at times pulls out a few musical surprises (for one, the blues medley will turn a lot of heads).  <br />Also, his visual perspective seems to have grown from lust to love: instead of pseudo-porn stage scenes, he brings out a gospel choir (for the song THE CHRIST aka THE CROSS).  No vanity...in more ways than one!  Which isn't to say Prince has eliminated sexuality from his show...it's just considerably more ready for prime-time than previously.  In fact, everything but the vitality of the music itself seems quite conservative in nature, and for once that's a relief (in an era where the negative messages of some pop music have come under fire even by free-speech proponents).         <br />For those of you who think that Prince and his peers' best musical moments are behind them, I suppose this concert could be used as an argument in favor of that assessment, given that only two of the twenty-plus songs are recent.  Yet one of the new songs (GREATEST ROMANCE) compares favorably with his classic repetoire, leaving open the probability that there's more great music to come.  As for the oldies, Prince still has some inspiration to give to tunes that he has probably played hundreds of times. It's a pleasure to see him focusing on the music, while foregoing most of the visual teases of the past.  Additionally, for long periods this concert recaptures the electricity of vintage funk, in a manner more vital than nostalgic.  Larry Graham is in top form on bass, and takes center stage for several Sly and Graham Central Station classics, joined by fellow Family Stone members (but not Sly himself).  Lenny Kravitz fits right in, as do Rosie Gaines, Maceo Parker, and of course Morris Day &amp; The Time.  Yes, the video parties more like it's 1984 than 1999.  Yet I find that I'm replaying it quite often...and for the first time in years looking forward to hearing what Prince has in store for us next.
0375703764|3.0|It's like one of those very psychedelic albums from the late sixties, where they do all those funny stereo effects, and all that phasing or whatever it was called - all great fun but you still had to have good songs. As you'll know by now, &quot;House of Leaves&quot; has more tricks up its sleeve than you can shake a James Joyce at, but not enough tunes. There are two stories. One's about this, you know, uh, what can I say - house. Okay, it's about the story of the book about the film about the house to be precise, but let's not overcomplicate things. The film at the centre of it all is called &quot;The Navidson Record&quot;, and so is the book about it. Hmmm - well, the house story is pretty good - yes, stolen from numerous genre horror movies and books, but not bad, sufficiently interesting, even a little bit creepy. (But come on, by no means edge-of-seat keeps-you-up-all-night, so I have to wonder about the encomium from Brett Easton Ellis - he should get out more.) Now the story of the house is wreathed with hundreds of footnotes - even the footnotes have footnotes, believe me - and I really liked them. They're a kind of deadly straight-faced parody of various kinds of commentators, some scholarly, some not. Very funny stuff, in a solemn, unsmiling way. Many intellectual jokes. Not much knockabout. But so far so good. However, and here's the downside, the footnotes are themselves encrusted with the random autobiographical jottings of the guy who supposedly discovered the book-about-the-film. His writings comprise story number two, the tale of Johnny Truant. And it's dire. It's most strange - I found the events of the spooky house more believable than I did the ludicrous cavortings of Johnny Truant - gratuitous sex, drugs, tattoo parlours, and existential angst by the bucketful. JT is inclined to spout off into pages of incomprehensible rantings at the drop of a tab, and it's just as interesting as someone describing their most wonderful/most terrifying acid trip, which is to say, it's really tiresome. Eventually I gotta say that JT and his pal Lude and his sexual fixations and his loony mother and his fights and his whole depressed, defeated and miserable schtick just serve to capsize what was otherwise an interesting and almost bold satire. Final note : with all the pages containing just one sentence or three words written back-to-front, plus photos and poems in foreign languages et etc this is a 400 page book posing as a 700 page book. Still big, but not THAT big.
B000002JSH|3.0|It is a matter of great regret that Free ever broke up.  The death of guitarist Paul Kossoff was a tragedy for the rock world.  But singer Paul Rogers and drummer Simon Kirke went on to form Bad Company with ex-King Crimson's Boz Burrell and guitarist Mickie Ralphs, who had the misfortune to play for Mott the Hoople, a slur on any serious musician's reputation.  And they recorded 'Bad Company', which is a great album, by any standard.  It also features, in its remastered format, a wonderfully clear sound, streets ahead of the muddy mix that was 'Heartbreaker', the last Free album.<br />But after 'Bad Company', they began to run out of ideas.  There are a couple of great tracks on 'Straight Shooter': 'Good Lovin' Gone Bad' and 'Feel Like Makin' Love'.  The re-mastered sound quality is also excellent.  But Paul Rodgers's voice was by now past its best.  And the lyrics are suspect, if you have any feminist sympathies whatsoever.<br />I'm glad I have this CD, but I would always point the new fan to the first record as the best introduction to Bad Company.

B00003CXDG|2.0|What a steaming pile of .... this is.  I thought Tom Cruise was better at choosing his projects but this is a return to his Days of Thunders/Cocktail days.  The movie is just so high on itself.  The scene where the two motorcycles fly up in the air while the two &quot;heroes&quot; fight belongs in a cartoon.  Don't get me wrong I like dumb cartoonish movies like Starship Troopers but John Woo takes this movie too seriously.  Even Anthony Hopkins's eyes (his cameo) were missing his usual fire.<br />Some people in Hollywood are WAY OVERPAID.
B00004Y635|5.0|I just bought Scream 3 this morning as soon as the store opened. I drove back home and popped it into the VCR and watched it. This one is amazing. There are no clues to who the killer is. I'm not going to spoil it for you. The ending is shocking. You find out a lot about Sidney's mother in this one. It keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole thing. But you should watch Scream and Scream 2 before you watch this one or you'll probably be lost. You gotta pick up this one! I suggest if you do have a DVD player then buy Scream 3 on DVD. I bought it on VHS, the DVD has tons of extra stuff like an alternate ending, etc. Make sure you see this one or you'll be missing out!
B00004Y7SF|4.0|The most wonderful part of the season stems from good holiday music.  Often times we are bogged down with maudlin melodies and dreery voices that echo the lonliness that this time of year can bring.  Fortunately, Christina Aguilera's album breaks through the clutter and resonates the jubliation that we should feel.  While this pint size diva has gotten flack this year from her designer duds to her attitude, there is no denying her vocal capabilites.  If she plays her cards right she might be able to avoid the pitfalls that her predecessors, Tiffany and Debbie fell for years ago.  But concentrating on this album, it gives your heart the chance to reach the limit and explode with joy.  Many other artists attempt and fail at holiday albums becuase their voice cannot adequately bring the excitement and power that actually delivers the songs.  Hope that this album brings as many rewars to you this year!!  No matter what your views on this mini diva are, you must get this cd and check it out.  Forget the nay sayers and teen mobs, a good voice should be heard and hailed.  Take care this Christmas!
0399146253|2.0|I believe that even bad Scarpetta is better than no Scarpetta and wouldn't think of missing a Cornwell book.  However disappointing I found this book, what I found most disturbing was the author's usurping of Linda Fairstein, a real life person who also writes mysteries (though legal rather than medical) with herself as a model for the protagonist.  The dedication to Fairstein seems like a forced nicety.  I find it most disturbing that a character in a novel should be lifted both from a real living person and her alter ego in novels.  Granted many Scarpetta characters are &quot;based&quot; on real people, but this seems too much.  I await the next book with hopes of originality.
6304119046|5.0|This was a movie we had to see in our History of the Cinema class (and the professor warned those who already saw it not to give away the significance of &quot;Rosebud&quot;!).  Orson Welles outdid himself with the direction and the different effects (and made an enemy of William Randolph Hearst, who this film is supposedly about).  Beranrd Hermann, who also contributed music for Alfred Hitchcock movies (particularly Psycho) and the Twilight Zone TV series, does an excellent job with the score.  For me, the most interesting part of Citizen Kane is seeing the kind of person Charles Foster Kane (Welles) was to others (he is seen as an egomaniac, shallow, lonely, private, and mysterious by each of them).  Nobody knows the real Kane in the end, not even the viewer.  This is one of those movies you should see at least once in your life (and if you really like it, you should see it again!).
0671027344|5.0|I was in my freshman year of high school when I read this novel, the same age as Charlie.  Unlike all the shows one watches on tv where all the teen agers are beautiful and popular; Charlie isn't. His words will touch you in a manner of realism like no other.  The honesty of of what his says makes this novel truely worth the read.  A fine read indeed.  Turn off the tv, stop watching picture perfect models of what teenagers are supose to be like and read this; the novel of what being a teenager is truely about-belonging.
0399146253|2.0|I was very disappointed with the ending of this book.  There was so much build up to the story of the Loup Garou and all the people that may or may not be involved with Chardonne.  I cannot believe she wrapped up the story in about 20 pages after building up the story for over 300 pages.  There was so much more she could have done with the ending that when I put the book down, I had a very bitter taste in my mouth and felt very let down.
B00004XONN|5.0|Has anyone noticed that if you pop open the cd jewel case there is a small booklet underneath?  It's not really liner notes.  More like bizarre art and jibberish but interesting.  So if you didn't know, pop it open and take a look.  <br />I like this cd a lot.  It took me a couple of times listening to it to really appreciate it.  No, it isn't as smooth and perfect as OK Computer.  It isn't as harsh and filled with angst as Pablo Honey.  It isn't as hard and heavy as The Bends.  But Kid A is eerily beautiful nonetheless.  That is the beauty of Radiohead --none of their albums are alike.  Each breaks new and different ground.  Thom Yorke and company never disappoint.  Give this one a listen.  You won't be disappointed.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is a strong debut by a band with ALOT of potential. The lyrics of every song is a good poem. My faviorite songs would be Runaway (with almost a incubus type feel), Papercut which has some really cool lyrics and is just a good overall song, and A place for my head is also great. One Step Closer is a bit made for radio and probably my least fave song on the CD. And perhaps the only drawback to tis band but prbably one of its greatest assets is its diversity of categories this could fall into
B00000JPH5|4.0|I remember being a tiny, innocent child and watching this brilliant film. This story is fantastic for any girl to see who's had to take care of a screaming baby. What a wonderful tale! This film takes you to a place where utter ugliness really exists. I don't know what else to say. There are some parts in this film which are so repulsive (such as the farting dungeon) and much more, but it is so great and funny! It is a real place to me, a place which exists within our minds. I simply love it!
0783243499|4.0|Where 1999 was considered one of the most exciting years for film, 2000 has been mostly derivative and dull as it quickly approaches an end.  The one movie that sticks out--I saw it twice in the theater--is &quot;American Psycho,&quot; a rib-tickling satire about young rich men who define themselves by hairstyle, bath products, the restaurants they eat at, etc.  As the hollow yet handsome yuppie serial killer Patrick Bateman, Christian Bale pulls off the act of being a soulless, angry snake quite well.<br />Despite other reviewers who take issue with the fact that the film isn't violent enough, a detail-by-detail adaptation of Ellis' book would go beyond an NC-17 (it'd be like watching snuff, probably).  Marry Harron's visual tricks imply most of the carnage, which may not be as disturbing as the scenes Ellis described, but do the trick all the same.<br />Like all well-crafted satires of late, &quot;American Psycho&quot; finds humor in the extremes of human behavior and the horrors we unleash on one another.  Even if this year had been as exciting as 1999, AP would still stick out.  As a spit in the eye of '80s greed, this tale is just a relevant today.
6305807086|1.0|One of the very few movies I have ever not been able to finish watching.  This is a trend movie:  1. No Plot  2. Totally Unlikable Charachters  3. Kooky.  <br />Kevin Smith has to apollogize for making Mallrats, yet this movie is praised?<br />What?
B00000DGUG|5.0|LISTEN TO IT A FEW TIMES AND YOUL LOVE IT!
B00004SVID|5.0|I bought this album after listening to a few of Pink Floyd's albums and I just have to say it is excellent!  Even though it is a live recording that was made 20 years ago, the remastering is awesome. Sometimes, you can hear crackling but that doesn't really matter. This album is great! It's not just a straight performance of the 1979 double-disc epic; Pink Floyd adds plenty to the value of this CD. Just check out a few of the songs, some of which were not available on the original album, like &quot;What Shall We Do Now?&quot; and &quot;The Last Few Bricks.&quot; Also, there are a few hilarious moments on it. Listen to Roger Waters questioning the audience before &quot;Run Like Hell&quot;: &quot;Are there any paranoids in the audience tonight? Is there anybody here who's weak?&quot; Also, you can hear someone saying,&quot;Shutup!&quot; during the second &quot;Master Of Ceremonies.&quot;  There was a lot of energy put into the concert. Many of the songs are performed at a faster tempo than the original album, creating a more thrilling feeling. Also, the only crowd noise you can hear is pretty much between songs, so that you don't get annoyed when they cheer at the good parts.  Also included are two very large booklets, and I mean VERY large; try fitting just one into one of your normal CD cases. Inside are interviews with the band and crew members about the production of the concert, along with dazzling, high-quality photos of the concert, which include several amazing shots of Gerald Scarfe's animations projected onto the stage.  I strongly recommend you purchase this CD. It has enough extras to keep you listening to it for a long time.

B00003CXDG|4.0|It was a given that, with the success of Mission Impossible, we were bound to witness a M:I-2 sooner or later. The sequel is very good, but it just couldn't live up to the success of its predecessor. This is probably because of minor irratations throughout the movie. First, with Tom Cruise playing a bigger role behind the cameras this time, a lot of the movie is focused on him. M:I-2 also uses slow-motion way too much. Some of the action scenes would have been way better if it weren't for this. But enough criticism, I didn't give this movie four stars for nothing.<br />The storyline in the sequal is very unique (and not nearly as confusing). The premise is simple; a bio-medical engineer has created a super-virus that only he himself has the cure to. When the virus gets into the wrong hands, it is up to Cruise to prevent a world-wide breakout. Woo did a stellar job on the action scenes in M:I-2, as well. Everybody will also be relieved to hear that the storyline is a lot easier to understand this time. There are still a lot of old fasioned plot twists this time, but they are explained much better.<br />All in all its a solid movie. The first 20 minutes or so are painfully slow, but if you can get past this, you will agree that this is a great film.
B00000DGUG|5.0|THE BEST ALBUM I EVER HEARD
B00004YMVC|4.0|Everything And Nothing is a well-balanced overview of the vocal side of David Sylvian's post-Japan career. While there's bound to be some arguing over what was and was not included, all of Sylvian's major album projects - the four solo albums, Rain Tree Crow, and Sylvian/Fripp - are represented, as are collaborations with Ryuichi Sakamoto, Mick Karn, and Alesini &amp; Andreoni. Then, of course, there some unreleased tracks, as well a couple of Japan tracks (one of which was previously unreleased).<br />The only real missteps are the new version of &quot;Ghosts&quot;, ruined by a re-recorded vocal track that lacks much of the emotional tension of the original, and stripped by the removal of its intro, which in the original version sets the mood for what follows; and the remixed version of &quot;Bamboo Houses&quot;, which includes a couple of superfluous elements either not found or not emphasized in the original mix.<br />Otherwise, despite being a compilation, Everything And Nothing is a welcome return to form. The outtakes from the Dead Bees On A Cake sessions are often more interesting than what made it onto the album, particularly &quot;The Scent Of Magnolia&quot; (which should have been a single) and &quot;Cover Me With Flowers&quot;. The remixed versions of &quot;Heartbeat (Tainai Kaiki II)&quot; and &quot;The Golden Way&quot; are both sparser than the original mixes, with &quot;The Golden Way&quot; in particular given an edge that the original lacked.<br />The songs that are not otherwise remixed or given new vocal tracks benefit from remastering, particularly the Rain Tree Crow tracks (&quot;Blackwater&quot;, &quot;Every Colour You Are&quot; and &quot;Cries And Whispers&quot;). &quot;Laugher And Forgetting&quot;, which segued into &quot;Before The Bullfight&quot; on Gone To Earth, here segues into the remixed version of &quot;Buoy&quot;, the 1987 collaboration with Mick Karn that subsequently appeared as the b-side of &quot;Let The Happiness In&quot;.<br />Listeners who found themselves disappointed by last year's Dead Bees On A Cake should find Everything And Nothing to be well worth the wait.steners who found themselves disappointed by last year's Dead Bees On A Cake should find Everything And Nothing to be well worth the wait.
B00004TH6O|3.0|I loved about 5 songs from their self-titled debut (like &quot;Regular John&quot; and &quot;Avon&quot;). The rest were just too Alice and Chainsy for my taste. But they won me over enough to give their new album a try. I cranked this on my van's cd player on the way home and began to fall in love with the first couple of tracks. Excellent production on the main instruments (the guitar is on fire). &quot;Auto Pilot&quot; completely alienated me. In every way a ploy to get on all the &quot;X&quot; alterna stations across the U.S. Cheesed out chorus and gutless beat. Same goes for the song w/ Mark Lanegan on vocals. A few of the other songs are heavy but in a derivative grunge manner that even STP wouldn't touch. A damn shame because on &quot;Leg of Lamb&quot; and &quot;I Think I Lost My Headache&quot; they've got some bizarre melodies and amazing Devo meets Sabbath stretched-out riffs going on. I no longer listen to this album because it just pisses me off when the top-40 shlock kicks in and it appears they're underachieving to win over some mainstream fans. Too bad because QOTS has shown me that they can get under the skin in a way that indie rock bands cannot yet they are more original than any other heavy group on the major labels. Boys, I want an ALBUM start to finish and I want it now!
B00004ZDVQ|5.0|It says much for how consistent Stevie Wonder's 1970s music was that &quot;Original Musiquarium,&quot; joining his best-known songs from his most successful era with four then-new recordings, fits together lyrically, musically, emotionally as a concept album.<br />Wonder's innovation during this remarkable period never seemed to cease; this continued right up to &quot;Musiquarium's impeccable  pacing. &quot;Ribbon In The Sky&quot; slides beside classic Wonder ballads like &quot;You Are The Sunshine Of My Life,&quot; and 1971's haunting &quot;Superwoman.&quot; The war protest &quot;Front Line&quot; furthers a social protest timeline begun by &quot;Superstition&quot; and &quot;You Haven't Done Nothin'.&quot; Wonder's Carribean-flavored &quot;Boogie On Reggae Woman&quot; and &quot;Master Blaster,&quot; play nicely against each other while the curtain-closer &quot;Do I Do&quot; (with Dizzy Gillespie on trumpet) pieces with &quot;Songs In The Key Of Life&quot;'s most jazz/R&amp;B-flavored moments.<br />The four new songs not withstanding for completists, this is why &quot;Musiquarium&quot; is the only greatest hits collection essential even to those owning the original LPs. How many artists can you say that about?
B00004XONN|5.0|\\"All THE BEST THINGS IN LIFE CANNOT BE DESCRIBED... THEY MUST BE EXPERIENCED\\"... When you really love your work (like an artist, songwriter, singer, designer, whatever...) you make things that you really like it, you don't think in other people, if you like it, that's ok (cool), but if you don't  (when you ear this album), you have a short point of view, because there are beauty in everywhere. All things change in time and space, Radiohead is an avant-garde band (like Autechre, Brian Eno, Bj&ouml;rk,Pansonic, Aphex Twin...) in constant evolution and \\"KID A\\" is the best sample, all the radiohead's albums are different. KID A is beautiful, sophisticated, deep, cold and wonderful album, if you really love RADIOHEAD you will love this album. KID A contains the best sound of music all tracks are spectacular but \\"optimistic\\" (track 6) is too much, \\"How disappear Completely\\", a beautiful, eerie wail, and the album rambling, mostly instrumental closing track, \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\", still capture much of the band's trademark allure... RADIOHEAD is music for the brain  &amp; soul. RADIOHEAD is the music of the FUTURE...
B00004TH7Z|5.0|When I look at the music industry today all I see is a bunch of crap being thrown out into the mix. It all sounds the same and you know what, it is all the same. No one takes the time to put thought and energy into a recording. So when I discovered that Iron Maiden had released a new album, I jumped on it. From the opening chords of &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; to the final note of &quot;The thin line between love and hate&quot;, I was totally blown away. This was tight and inspired music, not to mention awesome. Bruce dickinson's vocals were ear-shatteringly stunning and the guitar work of Smith, Gers, and Murray was brilliant. Niko's drums were unlike anything I had ever heard and Harris is a master of the bass. While this is not the best Maiden album-that honor goes to &quot;Powerslave&quot;-it is still one hell of a record. It is great to see that someone has decided to be brave enough to release somthing new that is this damn good into the world.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This album is a step up for Christina Aguilera. She throws all sorts of different genres in there, and sounds great doing it. She has R&amp;B, blues, and some gospel along with her traditional sound. The vocals on this CD are amazing and this CD is a must-have for the Christmas season.
B00003CXAT|3.0|this was a decent transfer and all but my main question is, why was the laserdisc and video that was released in '94 both 2.35:1 BUT the DVD version is 1.85:1?? I know that Lost World was filmed 1.85:1 and was released on video as such.
0399146253|2.0|I was anxiuosly awaiting the new release from Patricia Cornwell, having been a fan for years.  I was, unfortunately, disapointed in &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;, it lacks the action, suspense and mystery of her past novels.  It's a direct follow up from her last novel, so if you want to be able to follow along, re read her last novel before you bother picking this one up.  I was disappointed throughout the whole novel and let down at the end.  I'll continue to be a fan of the Kay Scarpetta series, hoping the next one is better.
B00004SCX6|5.0|For all of you who claim that this CD will collect dust a week after you buy it.. well it has been 6 months and it is still constantly in my CD player. If you liked her old album, or like any of her songs, this one is for you! It has some truly amazing songs, and I think it is great! She is laughing all the way to the bank guys, and she deserves it!
0449000729|5.0|This book is about the story of a small town in the south of England.  Just relating the story of this town, the author is relating the history of England.<br />Each chapter of this book is about a different period of history and it is narrated through the lives of four different families.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book vey much.  All the characters are exceptionally well described and real. Also, each chapter with its history explains the how and why of changes and progress.<br />If anyone is interested in understanding history, I really recommend this book.  It is a masterpiece.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|I just have one word for this CD-- Excellent! Just listening to it makes me in the mood for the holidays and geared up to start my christmas shopping! Here is my song by song review- Track #1- &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot; feat. Dr. John  This track is very nice, Christina sounds great with Dr. John<br />Track #2- &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; This track is wonderful! I liked the song before Christina recorded it and hearing her beautiful voice singing it makes it better!<br />Track #3- &quot;This Christmas&quot;  An upbeat, spirited song that gets you in the mood for the holidays.<br />Track #4- &quot; The Christmas Song&quot; *Live* This is what Christina sang to President Clinton last year, and it sounds wonderful. It features Christina's amazing powerhouse voice.<br />Track#5- &quot;Silent Night/ Noche de Pas&quot;  A classic song. Christina adds her own touch to it and makes it an even more awesome song. She sings in spanish also.<br />Track #6- &quot;Angels We Have Heard on High&quot; Another classic song that Christina makes her own, adding on her own touch. Great vocals.<br />Track #7- &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; feat. Billy Preston This is my favorite song on the record. Her mystifying voice left me in chills. <br />Track #8- &quot;These are special times&quot;  Another great song,  her vocals are outstanding.<br />Track #9- &quot;Christmas Time&quot;  Good Song, very catchy.<br />Track #10- &quot;This Year&quot; Good Song, not one of my personal favorites.<br />Track #11- &quot;The christmas Song&quot; Remixed Version I love this song! It adds on a beat that makes you want to dance!  Christina has done it again, she has made another album that makes you happy and satisfied. Great Buy!
0449002632|5.0|Edward Rutherford has done it again.  This book about the history of London is another masterpiece.<br />He brings to the reader the whole evolution of this beautiful and incredible city from its very early periods during the stone age to present day happenings.<br />Each chapter relates a different period in history, narrated through the activities of different families through the ages.<br />Even though London is part of England, by being its center of politics and commerce it has always been considered a special happening place.<br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history. You will certainly enjoy reading this book!
B0000027RL|5.0|Some albums just don't seem to have the right amounts of everything music should have- talented people who can actually play their instruments, a singer with an outstanding voice,  and powerful lyrics. On Ten, Pearl Jam had all that in a perfect balance. As many times as I've heard it, I still cannot stop listening to Jeremy because in addition to having a great melody, the lyrics still make me come close to tears every time I hear them. You also have some of the best opening and closing songs you'll ever hear on any album (Once and Release),what could possibly be PJ's best radio single ever (Even Flow), and a beautiful slow song where Eddie Vedder gets to show off his voice for all its worth (Black,my favorite). One listen to this album will show you right away why Pearl Jam are still considered one of the most innovative groups around and bands like Creed are just rip-offs that are nothing compared to the real thing. (I mean, could they really have written anything like Jeremy? No chance.)
B00003CXHJ|5.0|It's the best movie on World War 2 submarine I ever seen. The characters are really good. The story is impressive. There's suspense in every second of the movie. I strongly recommend it to buy.
0783226063|2.0|I made the mistake of seeing this movie before reading the book on which it was supposedly based.  At first, I thought it was an interesting enough movie, with a few oddities and curious names thrown in, but then I read Frank Herbert's masterpiece, Dune.  This film throws all the important details out the window, discarding key concepts that make Herbert's Dune Novels some of the most memorable books in the science fiction world.  I must give the director credit for creative (if completely inaccurate) sets and props, and going through all this trouble to create a movie that didn't do so well, but the film doesn't do the book justice.  Read Dune first, and you'll see what I mean.
B00004WIBW|4.0|Although Burton's take on &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; could be described as a hollow attempt at Irving's short story, it does provide a more frightful and action-filled plot than the original work of fiction.  The lighting is fanciful, changing as the film nears its conclusion.  The acting may seem stilted at times, but it seems to inhance the flavor of the main character's radical crime solving methods.
0679879269|5.0|This book still gives me chills. It's the kind of book whose world you dive into and you never want to leave. Very few writers come close to getting an inkling of the way the world works. An excellent series that is filled with hope, wide-eyed innocence, courage and sacrifice and love.
0399128964|2.0|Everyone else has given this five stars, but I am writing to let people know that some of you may not like it.  BIG QUALIFICATION: I have to admit I have not read the entire book.  The first time I tried was in college, but I only got to around p. 150.  Now, 13 years later, I had to give up at p. 250.  (I would appreciate it if someone could tell me at what stage it gets better.)<br />The book is simply dull.  I point out the following:<br />THIS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION:  Yes, the setting is some distant future, with space travel etc.  But this is definitely not science fiction.  There is no theme around technology, scientific dilemma, or interaction/conflict between humanity and technology/science. The correct genre is fantasy.  It calls to mind the Lord of the Rings (I did read all of that) in its rich detail of a fantasy world.  <br />STORYLINE IS TOO DULL:  sure, the detail is impressive, but the story is predictable.  It starts out with so much promise - the struggle among the noble houses, the Emperor, the Guild, etc. in a complex setting.  But the book disappoints.  The characters are so one-dimensional in their various superhuman skills or character traits that they are like comic book characters.  The Bene Gesserit, Mentat, and others are capable of understanding the grandest significances from the minutest of details - it just becomes too ridiculous after a while.<br />STORY HAS NO SUSPENSE:  You know from the first few chapters how everything is supposed to turn out.  So many prophecies.  And then you have the silly, pretentious mock quotations that preface each chapter - there is absolutely no suspense because you see that everything is going according to prophecy.  It is like reading the Bible - you know how all conflicts will turn out in the end.<br />TOO MANY INCONSISTENCIES:  Characters see the most elaborate intrigues in the simplest things, and understand the most byzantine possibilities in strategic maneuvering.  Precisely because Herbert makes hischaracters so &quot;perceptive&quot; - and plots and intrigues so complex - you start to see silly inconsistencies.  For example, you have Lady Jessica and Thufir Hawat (a Bene Gesserit and a Mentat - two superanalysts) know that there is a traitor and that their situation is precarious when they arrive on Arrakis.  But the room in the fortress that controls the protective shield is occupied by a couple of engineers and an old woman such that the traitor is able to kill them with a knife and thereby bring down the entire dukedom.  How can you explain this oversight?  Another example:  Arrakis is practically the most important planet in the universe because of the spice.  Yet the Emperor has sent only one ecologist who has any idea what the planet is about while everyone else is only interested in mining the spice?  In real life, would corporations and nations behave this way?  Third example: if the Emperor and the Harkonnen are so ignorant and cavalier about the planet's ecology, wouldn't it have occurred to them that they could get rid of the pesky sandworms with bombs when they come to swallow the mining equipment?  I know that no book can be airtight in its premises (and that there are inconsistencies in the real world as well).  But because Herbert creates such a complex, rich world with clever, superhuman powers of perception, he invites the reader to read with a higher level of critical analysis.  And the book cannot survive the higher critical analysis.<br />I would appreciate if a fan of Dune could tell me why I'm wrong.  Or at least around what page the book gets any better.  Until then, the book goes on my shelf of books that I regretted ever starting.
B000005JA8|4.0|Trout Mask is probably the Captain's least accessible record, but it's still wonderful. Rating it above a four though is overdoing it, I think he reached a good happy medium point in his music a couple more albums down the road (Spotlight Kid/Clear Spot)which I put on more often than Trout Mask. A great long (double album) work that requires the listener's undivided attention (and many plays) to fully &quot;get it&quot;. It mixes free jazz, blues and beat type poetry successfully. Actually the spoken word pieces &quot;Orange Claw Hammer&quot; and &quot;The Dust Blows Forward And The Dust Blows Back&quot; are two of my favorite spots on this release. Beefheart is artsy, but with a sense of humor and a rootsy feel. If you want to get into his music , I wouldn't recommend buying this first; it may be a little harsh for newcomers.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Hey I'd like to review Christina's new album. I'd advise everyone to go out and get it. Not only is she a wonderful singer with a beautiful voice but, my favorite songs are Christmas songs and she's my favorite artist. These are all great songs! Please go out and buy her CD as soon as possible or buy it on Amazon! :-)            Thanx!
B0000256VK|2.0|First of all , there are two types of Roxy fans;there are those who worship the early experimental yet rocking work (me)and the 80's adolescents who only know this album (and sometimes Manifesto and Flesh And Blood). I was so dissappointed when I bought this back in '82. What happenned to my music gods !! This is nothing but stale, mellow, batchelor pad background music; toothless,overrated and unchallenging for musicians of this magnitude. It's the one Roxy album I've never re-bought on CD.The vinyl sits untouched on a shelf. When I hear people praise this &quot;mature&quot; album, I want to play them Country Life; it's the real deal.
0679879269|5.0|I have read the first book at least a hundred times, my cat is named after a character, and I thought that nothing could ever obtain the perffection that the Golden Compass acheived.  But The Amber Spyglass surpasses the Golden Compass By FAR!!  If a more perfect book exsists, I would like to read it, truly.  I love this series, it changed my outlook on many things in life.
B00003W8NM|5.0|No questions, you have to buy this movie. First off,  Fight Club is such an awsome movie. If you have seen it, then by now you must be out trying to convince your friends that this is the greatest movie ever. If you havn't seen it, let me be the first to tell you this is the greatest movie ever. Second, fox did am awsome job with the DVD. You get almost too much stuff to look at. Tons of pictures, tons of trailers, tons o visual effects shots, and more. Deleted scences, 4 audio  commentary tracks and more make this the DVD that you will show to your friends. Not only that but the audio rules with a great THX transfer. Buy this DVD, you owe it to yourself really...
B00004XOWM|1.0|I cannot believe I wasted money on this. There isn't one original song on this album. How do they go from &quot;Three dollar bill yall&quot; which rocked, to an N'Sync wannabe. Please, don't buy this.
B00004Z4WR|1.0|This is the very worst movie ever made. -Nicolas Cage isn't an actor, he's an impostor -the other actors are less than nothing -The cars chases are full of mistakes<br />Finally, HOLLYWOOD is a big trash today HA
B00003CXGP|4.0|about a week after I saw it.  There's something so arrogant and contrived about its sequences that you have to ask yourself &quot;is this for real?&quot; The answer, of course, is no. The whole film (as well as the book), in all its nonsense, is just a metaphor for a material society driven by impulse and self-gratification. You then realize that every scene portrays its characters as almost &quot;characters&quot; of themselves, polished and human-like &quot;packages&quot;. Batemen, the most obvious, is basically the male distillation of everything that's reprehensible about human nature;  he's overly handsome, wealthy, resouceful and witty, and is part of unique Manhatten uptown clique.  What's interesting is how he represents the American Dream, everything that we secretly strive to be (or at least everything that the American culture leads us to believe is important), whether or not we know it;  the only difference being that he goes as far as to act out his impulses. So is Elliot saying that, we, as an audience, are suffocated by the American dream to the point where we have become numb under its spell, have become so lost in the process of obtaining status and material that we've lost touch with each other? That we've become selfish, self-centered, ego-maniacal performers in our own lives? That our conversations are hollow and superficial?  That our relationships are nothing more than devices built to enhance personal attainment? When we see Bateman, a reflection of our ideals, carry out ritualistic acts of violence, it come across as both disgusting and hilarious. I walked out of the theater feeling jipped, like I have been made fun of. And now, as I write this review, I am finally understanding that I, as an American, was being mocked. The second time I watched it I was even more humored by Bateman's dry and hammy performance. I agree that this movie is not for everyone, but watch it,  think about it,  give it a chance; the stuff on the screen is just a tool.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Although Christina's new CD isn't out yet, I'm sure it won't fall short of my expectations.  I loved her first CD and I know her second album will be even better.  I hope to get a copy of her CD as soon as it comes out.  That's all.
B00000I8DY|5.0|The reviews featured here are mostly accurate and very positive. And so they should be! This opera (and this recording) is a masterpiece. Rene Jacobs, with his usual conviction and invention, vindicates &quot;Cosi&quot; probably as Mozart's greatest opera. Now all the bad press which this opera has collected over the years seems to glare rather badly in light of this recording.     With the exception of Graciela Oddone's delicious Despina the rest of the cast range from disappointing (Gens) to acceptable (Fink and the male cast). The men on the whole actually sing much better than the women. In older recordings, one usually encounters problems with the unfortunate tenor who is unable to comfortably negotiate Ferrando's fierce tessitura. Here Rene Jacobs finds a Ferrando who sounds as if this role had been specifically written for him. The Guglielmo and Don Alfonso are very capably handled.   Fink and Gens should have the sense to stick to operas/roles where less vocal punch is required of their androgynous voices. They can do nothing about the voices they have been born with, but Gens unlike Fink, is frequently off-pitch and has NO trill and has very little flexibility to speak of - there is no excuse for this especially since she features in a lot of early music recordings. Gens is often quite exquisite in the ensembles, but in her arias she leaves much to be desired. Her weakness is the obvious lack of technical refinement: listen to her inability to hold on for the full length of the sustained A towards the end of the duet, &quot;Ah guarda sorella&quot;. And then listen to Caballe singing the same section and you'll know what I mean. Caballe's unbeatable interpretation under Davis combines Mediterranean warmth with an athletic flexibility and a stupendous command of bel canto which any interpreter of Fiordiligi needs. This command of bel canto unfortunately completely eludes Gens  - specifically in the lightning triplets of &quot;Come scoglio&quot; and the cascade of trills in &quot;Per pieta&quot; - things which hold no terrors for the formidable Caballe. For a real flesh and blood Fiordiligi, I urge you to give the Davis recording from the 70's a go.    The only really big fault one may find with the Jacobs recording is that everyone seems to be trying to get all the notes just right - resulting in a lot of expression being lost in the search for perfection.     Even though it may seem as though I am slating this recording, I cannot recommend it highly enough. Jacobs' conducting leaves one breathless: he involves the orchestra into the drama of the opera - this, however, is an innovation of Harnoncourt, who has also made a stunning recording of &quot;Cosi&quot;.     Please buy this recording if you want just one copy of &quot;Cosi&quot; - it is as close as you will find to what Mozart may have wanted us to hear.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|My Kind of Christmas is surley a hit!  The music is music that will keep you happy!  And her voice is really great!  She puts soul in her words and makes you feel it.  She is surely a diva and this CD is surely a hit.  Every song on this CD is song great and will make you never doubt how great of a singer Christina Aguilera is.

B00004ZB9D|5.0|Lenny Kravitz started his career in the mid to late 80s, and his first album was Let Love Rule. The message was of importance, it was love and acceptance. Mama Said was released in 1991 and did very well, as did his 1993 album Are You Gonna Go My Way. His 1995 album Circus was his reaction to the media, who made him feel as though his life was a circus that everyone was watching. 5 was his next album in 1998, later rereleased in 1999 with 2 extra tracks. This album is an anthology of his hits from those albums, with an added bonus of the new song called Again. This is a must for fans of Kravitz.
0811826848|5.0|This is a comprehensive overview of the Beatles from the very beginning...full of photos and handwritten notes, school programs, and family reminises.  It follows the band through various incarnations (loved the old flyers and advertisements) and various influences. Each member has a voice, and it facinating to see each person evolve into the personalities we remember so well.  It is also a comprehensive look into the cultural changes that raced through the 60's.  Family and friends also contribute to the narritive, and it is a refreshingly honest  and uninhibited look at the band.  The eventual breakup of the band is chronicled, and it  captures the apathy and ambiguity that made the &quot;announcement&quot; so hard to believe, and fuled the hope the reunion was possible.  The actual book was a bit unwieldy.....not one you could cosy up on the couch with.  Don't let that discourage you..
B00003CXDB|5.0|Oliver Stone researched this movie pretty good to portray Wall Street behind the scenes as authentic as possible. And while the financial dimensions from when this movie was made have significantly increased to at least ten times higher amounts today, the basic principles still apply. That's why the movie comes across fresh. Michael Douglas gives an excellent performance and Charlie Sheen is doing good too. Douglas plays the wealthy financier Gordon Gekko as he takes on one deal after the other with information being the most important commodity . . . insider information that is. The movie isn't made on a small budget either like some of the recent copycats, but instead the beach house, the offices, the plane, the cars (except for Charlie Sheen's car), the wardrobe, all have style. While Gekko is supposed to be the bad guy, he comes across as very likeable and he shows us capitalism at its finest . . . it's a game as money is never lost but only transferred and whoever has the most in the end, wins. The question in the movie of how much is enough is answered there with it's not a matter of enough, and it certainly inspired the bull market of the 90s with its crystal clear reality of no limits and it's never going to be enough. Greed is good as Gekko proclaims in this motion picture.
0312955006|5.0|I've read a lot of mysteries: just about the entire &quot;Travis McGee&quot; series by John D. MacDonald; all of the &quot;Fletch&quot; novels (including the two &quot;Son of&quot; books) by Gregory McDonald; every Raymond Chandler piece of fiction; most of Dashiell Hammett; some Ed McBain; many Carl Hiassen books; a few Agatha Christies.<br />Michael Connelly ranks up there with all of those distinguished writers.  He has a fluid, detailed writing style that conveys the scene without bogging down in such intricacies that the reader gets lost.  The dialogue is snappy and hard-boiled but will probably age well (unlike, say, some of Chandler's).<br />&quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; is the third novel starring LAPD detective Harry Bosch.  (The order goes &quot;The Black Echo,&quot; &quot;The Black Ice,&quot; &quot;The Concrete Blonde,&quot; &quot;The Last Coyote,&quot; &quot;Trunk Music,&quot; and &quot;Angel's Flight.&quot;  The new novel coming out in early 2001 involves Bosch as well, but it's not clear if Bosch is the main character or a secondary character.)  I've read the first three and the last (&quot;AF&quot;), and, while they are all good, &quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; is the best thus far.<br />Earlier in his career, an incident that is described or alluded to in virtually every novel, Bosch gained some notoriety and fame for taking down a serial killer known as &quot;The Dollmaker.&quot;  He was so called because he would use makeup and polish to paint up his victims.  The killer sent bad poems to Bosch, taunting him with descriptions of the victims.  Eventually, Bosch tracked down the killer and shot him to death when the man reached toward his pillow . . . for a hairpiece, as it turned out.  Bosch was cleared of wrongfulness in the shooting, though he was disciplined for not calling for backup.<br />Fast forward four years.  The dead man's widow is now suing the LAPD and Bosch for violating her husband's civil rights, and the case is going to trial.  All of a sudden, a letter is dropped off for Bosch at the police department: it contains a poem, just like the ones the Dollmaker sent, and it leads the LAPD to another body . . . which is painted up just like the Dollmaker's victims.  Could Bosch have killed the wrong man?<br />&quot;The Concrete Blonde&quot; alternates between the court scenes and the investigation of the new murder, and the transitions are deftly handled.  While the court scenes are not perfectly accurate (I am, unfortunately, a lawyer by trade), they are much better than in most novels.<br />The mystery is tight and compelling.  Having read lots of mysteries, I often am able to guess at the outcome simply because the set-up reminds me of another book I've read.  In fact, that happened with &quot;The Black Ice.&quot;  Not so with &quot;The Concrete Blonde.&quot;  About 180 pages into it, I thought I had it figured out.  With about 50 pages to go, I thought my instinct had been confirmed.  Oops.  I was wrong, and about as shocked as Bosch!<br />In addition to weaving a great mystery, Connelly paints a reasonably deep picture of his main character, Bosch, a Vietnam veteran (he cleared out enemy tunnels) who is simultaneously cultured but also emotionally damaged.<br />To sum it up, let me put it this way: I started with &quot;Angel's Flight,&quot; and when I was finished, I ordered all of the Harry Bosch novels immediately.
B00004W5UA|5.0|There are only 3 reasons why one would not like this movie. One, you came in expecting Rambo and left with the aftertaste of Hitchcock. Two, you're one of those overly cynicall people who pretend to be superior by hating what a lot of people like for a good reason. Because to you anything with violence or anything slightly off the norm is shallow and trying to be hip. or three, you just didn't get it, oh well, you'll always have American Pie to entertain your feeble mind. The bottom line is that this movie has a lot to say about every aspect of life, spirituality, politics (and not &quot;what should we do with HMO's?&quot; politics, we're talking real political theory here), identity, individuality, relationships, and more are all covered in this masterpiece. you can write it off as tragically hip or overly violent any day, but the truth is you found this movie hard to swallow in one gulp.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina has proven that she can sing more than love songs, and some adults dont think that she can sing that good. Go out and buy this CD if you enjoy the holiday time and holiday music. You'll probably like it! She has shown how good she can sing and how well she sings for only a 19 year old (almost 20 in December (18th)). You'll probably shocked by her tallent from this cd. From &quot;The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire)&quot; to &quot;Angels We Have Heard On High&quot; to a song that most of us are farmiliar with, &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot; and &quot;Silent Night&quot;. She does serious vocal acrobatics with so much confidence and clarity on 'My Kind Of Christmas', you'll forget that five of these songs are known all around the world for people that do celebrate Christmas and some that don't, and that she's a very modest 19 year old.
B00003CX5A|5.0|I never had the opportunity to see Sleepy Hollow in theatres but heard great things from a number of my colleagues and friends. When the movie came out on DVD I took notice and rented it. Sufficit to say, I was not disappointed in any way. Burton's interpretation of the Headless Horseman myth was masterful and conveyed the perfect atmosphere for the story. Gory and gothic, there was always a sense of darkness and foreboding during the movie. For those of us who had only the merest passing affiliation with the original myth, much (if not all) of the story was surprising and suspenseful. Personally, though, I think the occasional use of comedy helped to keep the story from becoming too dark in tone, and I really enjoyed this movie. For anyone with an interest in suspense, drama, horror, or even fantasy (much of the movie had a fantasy feel to it), this movie is sure to delight.
B000006TRV|1.0|This is the most overrated album in all of rock and roll. This is Pink Floyd's WORST album bay far. Nothing compared to Wish You Were Here, Meddle, or Dark Side. Now, it does have some good material(Happiest Days of Our Live/Another Brick Part II, In The Flesh, Is There Anybody Out There) and even a three really great songs(Comfortably Numb, Hey You, Mother) But this album is way too long. I can barely stay awake when I put it on. Roger Waters may actually do a good job of telling the story he sets out to tell. The problem is, by the end of this grueling over 100 minute recording, nobody cares. It is so hypocritical to hear millionaire rock stars singing about rebelling against education. This album is was way too ambitious and way too dull to be even listenable.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Lenny has done obviously pure classics out of his music. He really knows how to blend feeling with beat. He is an artist, and an excellent singer. This is an excellent portfolio of his work. However, I miss &quot;Always on the run&quot; and any selection of his MTV Unplugged session.<br />Nevertheless, if you are a fan or want to get into an ocean of funk, love and feeling, this is your album
6304083769|5.0|While it largely failed to make the American public aware of anime's existence, this movie is one of the best works of hardcore science fiction out there, animated or live-action.  Excellent action sequences, intriguing philosophical questions, and tragic characterizations abound in Ghost in the Shell.  I'd definitely recommend the subtitled version; the dubbed has a moderate amount of mistranslation.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This is the first time I have actually bought a Christmas CD, and thought it was the best CD the artist has ever done. Granted, this is Christina's 3rd effort. Yet, &quot;My Kind of Christmas,&quot; shows that an artist can grow artistically while doing seasonal music. Highlight tracks include, track 1, &quot;Christmastime&quot;, and a beautiful version of Silent Night. I would definitely reccomend this album to anyone who enjoys the holiday season, a great voice, or even just wonderful pop music. Christina has truly seperated herself from peers like Brittany Spears with this album.
B000002ITW|5.0|I lived for 18 months in a mud hut village in North West Iran. This was back in the beginning of the seventies. I had a set of earphones, a sony cassette deck and tapes of Iron Butterfly, Doors &quot;live&quot; and 4 way street by Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. I didn't need a lot more. 4 Way Street is still one of the great sounds. Take no notice of the bad points, live recording was still primitive in them there days and that's why you can imagine that you are at the concert because live sound used to be bad. Buy and enjoy.
B000002UAU|3.0|Only Pink Floyd's The Wall is more overrated(their WORST album). The fact that anyone still thinks this the best Beatles album - let alone the best rock album - perplexs me. Sure, it is good and probably the most influential album of all time. But it pails in comparison to the White Album, Abbey Road and Rubber Soul. The reason? McCartney does most of the song writing. Now, he's alright, but his talent is not even close to that of Lennon.(look at his solo CRAP) The first 3 songs are all awesome. Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is just so trippy. When I'm 64, Lovely Rita, and Fixing A Hole are all pretty good. The Sgt Pepper Reprise leads in perfect to A Day In The Life, which is one of the best songs ever recorded. The problem I have with this album is Within You Without You, Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite, and She's Leaving Home, which, although somewhat trippy, are still little better than filler tracks. All in all, it's certainly a very good album and certainly is listenable, but it doesn't make my top 5 favorite Beatles albums.

0945001193|4.0|Mein Kamph although long winded, a tremendous insight into how an individual can through being a failure apportion blame and hit out at minorities in order to further a cause by appealing to the lowest common denominator. I must say that I found the book to be a far better read than other reviewers have. If you are looking for a riveting read you will be disappointed but as a study of human nature it is a remarkable book.

B00000IPAX|5.0|blink 182 pulled out all the stops on this one...they have really pulled it together and came out with a really good album...they have managed to stay punk and not go mainstream, but they are on the brink...but this one is in the clear...so it is a definite MUST BUY
B00004XOWM|5.0|This CD combines the best of 3 Dollar Bill Y'all and Significant Other to produce a unique blend of rap, rock, and even some slower alternative ballads. The best songs are my way, rollin (air raid vehicle), take a look around, it'll be ok, boiler, and my generation. This CD is overall a lot better than Significant Other, and, although I think 3 Dollar Bill Y'all will always be the most original Limp CD, Starfish gives the listeners a wider variety of music to enjoy.
0399146253|4.0|From page 1 of The Last Precinct, this long-time Cornwell reader senses  that great (and welcome) change is afoot.  It opens with Dr. Kay Scarpetta, one of far too few literary heriones, trapped under the microscope of watchful law enforcement personnel as she packs up her belongings and what seems to be her life.  Her home, her sanctuary has become the very crime scene she has investigated throughout her tenure as Virginia's Chief Medical Examiner.  <br />Faithful friend and colleague, Police Captain Pete Marino, is present to protect Scarpetta from her own dark thoughts, as well as the chain of public fools who secretly are plotting her demise.  Niece Lucy returns to offer her Aunt Kay protection. And her lover and best friend, Benton Wesley, returns from the dead to offer both Scarpetta and Marino clues that ultimately help save their lives.<br />If these names don't sound familiar, don't worry.  It is not necessary to have read The Black Notice, the predecessor novel to The Last Precinct, or the many other Cornwell Scarpetta novels, to appreciate the book.  It is recommended, however.   <br />Scarpetta must she find the inner strength to survive the heinous attack on her own life by the grotesque serial killer, Jean-Baptiste Chandonne, aka the &quot;werewolf.&quot;  In the midst of dealing with this crisis, she must defend herself against a whole new set of would-be assasins. And do so alone since most of the people she has come to trust in her life prove untrustworthy.  She faces an indictment for a crime that she did not commit.  Trhoug all of her own personal and professional turmoil, she must muster the courage and will to investigate new crimes that appear connected to Chandonne, including the hanging death of an innocent young boy. And perhaps most difficult for Scarpetta, she must place her life in the hands of a top female prosecutor from New York, Jaime Berger, who has come to Richmond, ultimately to offer Scarpetta salvation.<br />Cornwell provides many glimpses into the mind of Scarpetta.  Her thoughts, her feelings of despair, her questioning of everything known to her. This may bother some readers.  But it adds a more human dimension to Scarpetta that the earlier novels lack.  <br />In the end, Scarpetta is able to solve the new crimes by relying on the gut instincts and forensic expertise that has served her so well in the past.  And she is able to let go of past demons and look forward to a new life.<br />Cornwell is smart to move her heroine onward in her career path. The Virginia Medical Examiner's Office was growing stale for material.  With one foot still in the public sector -- Scarpetta returns the favor to prosecutor Berger by agreeing to participate in Chandonne's trial in New York -- and the other in the private sector, Cornwell will be able to introduce a whole new set of story lines and characters in future novels.  A good read.
0380788624|5.0|If you're a hacker, or even think you know what one is, you need to read this book. Once you're done, you'll have an astoundingly accurate picture of what a hacker *really* is (not necessarily what CNN says we are), and you'll have enjoyed a well-written story to boot.<br />The plot is quite intricate, and jumps back and forth from WWII to the modern day with gleeful abandon. The characters are mostly well-written, though with so many, it's inevitable that you'll be left wanting to know some of them better (Randy's grandfather comes to mind here). Like Clancy, there's lots of technical information thrown in, but it really does advance the plot, not just display the author's technical prowess -- in most cases, anyway. This may be the first novel I've ever read with a Perl script in it, and definitely the first that devotes several pages to the proper way to eat Captain Crunch.<br />Be prepared to spend lots of time with this novel. If you're a hacker, you'll identify deeply with a number of the characters. If you're not, don't worry -- there's lots of other folk in there. And the story is great. Definitely a good investment of your entertainment dollar.
B000023VR6|4.0|this is a great return for dre.  its a tight album, and most all of the songs are good, and the ones that are popular, are qute good, unlike eminem, who gets old...dre is just as good everytime, so if you like dre style rap, get this
0140386335|5.0|The Neverending Story provides for its main character exactly what it provides for its readers; an escape from reality in order to take a look at their lives. There lives inside the most timid of all human beings a strong and corageous warrior. Every failing student has the right answer. Every bully has a soft spot. Michael Endes fantasy is targeted towards young adult readers, but young and old alike respond to the most incredible story ever told.<br />Bastian Balthazar Bux, the main character, feels his life is not worth living. His mother is dead, his father is disconnected from reality, his fellow students hate him, he's not happy with his appearance and it seems that his only escape is through literature. Only when he is at his lowest point does fate step in to point him in the right direction. He steals a book called the Neverending Story from a back alley book shop for some unexplained reason. All he knows is that he is compelled and meant to read the book. Hiding in the attic of his school, he reads the story as if he is a character himself... until at last he finally is. His life will never be the same again.
0671034065|3.0|In short, the book kept my attention but the mystery wasn't much of a mystery.  The love story between the two main charactors was nice but a bit on the &quot;teenagery&quot; side.  <br />The plot/storyline was original/fresh.  <br />Those who enjoy Sandra Brown's thrillers may be a bit let down.
B00004XPQ2|4.0|This movie rates as one of my favorites.  The parade of the captured british battalion marchingt into its new prsion camp ranks as one the most memorable scenes in my movie viewing history.  Alec Guiness' portaryal of Nicholson is superb.  Willaim Holden's also performed well in this film.  Also note what happens when the British use female bearers. &quot;Be Happy in Your Work.&quot;
B00000DHRZ|2.0|The offspring needs to just QUIT. over the years, they have just gotten worse and worse, i think its time for them to just give up...this album gets incredibly annoying after you hear it about 2.5 times...and it becomes bubble gum music...music that you listen to which forces you to want to jam wads of bubble gum into your ears so you don't have to listen to it....and YES its THAT bad
0684853523|3.0|King maintains that he wrote the first part of this book before his terrible accident and the rest following.  Unfortunately, it shows.  The first part of the book has a snappiness and freshness that is missing from the rest of the book.  I wasn't swept away by this book as I have been by other &quot;writing books&quot; -- say by Natalie Goldberg.  But then not all writing books should or can do that.<br />The main part of this book is packed with practical,  how-to information for novice and established writers alike.  All of it is useful.  None of it is unimportant.  The best part?  King's claim that you can make a competent writer into a good writer, but you can't make a bad writer into a compentent one.  You have to come with a certain amount of stuff already intact.  I'm glad someone has finally put that out there on the table for the truth that it is.  King also includes a line-by-line edit of one of his own stories so you can compare and contrast.<br />I was also impressed by King's great intelligence.  Of course, you can't write even bad run-away bestsellers if you don't have some brains and talent, but it really came through in this book.  And one cannot dismiss his courage in going back to his desk after his tragic accident.  There is a lot to be learned from this &quot;short&quot; book (King's words).
0553106635|5.0|George R. R. Martin is a truly gifted writer and story-teller, and &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; is about as good as it gets. The characters in this series are credible and compelling, the lines between good and evil are complex and deftly handled, and the storyline itself never fails to, at turns, both delight and horrify the reader.<br />I would rather read through any of Martin's books over and over again than slog my way through most other fantasy novels and/or series--Martin is THAT good. If you are unfamiliar with these books, then buy &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot; and read it. You, too, will become totally hooked on this marvelous and engrossing series, one that, amazingly, just keeps getting better and better with each new volume.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|It hardly seems like it's time for a greatest hits cd from lenny, but it's been 11 years since Let Love Rule. This is a solid greatest hits collection with all the hits - Let Love Rule, Are U Gonna Go My Way?, It Ain't Over 'Til Its Over, Fly Away - and all the essentials - Mr. Cab Driver, Believe, Heaven Help. It also includes the great new single &quot;Again.&quot;  Greatest Hits shows off Lenny's tremendous skills as a musician and vocalist. It also highlights his influences, from the Beatles to James Brown to Led Zeppelin to Prince. For diehards, it's a great collection to take on a plane ride or put in the car when you want a good Lenny mix. For new fans, it's a great intro to what you've been missing for the last decade. He built this garden for us!
B00000JCB2|5.0|this album is the bizkit's finest work.  they just put it all together...and it was a real big improvement from three dollar bill...they featured some other people, and with tracks like break stuff, nookie, n 2 gether now...i mean, COME ON!! it is the BEST
B00003CXA6|5.0|Jeff Daniels' surprising, great performance in words could serve as another Gettysburg Address as he utters them; his words in a speech to Maine's &quot;mutineers&quot; alluded to the only other army in recorded history with just such a mission -but without a powerful political state behind it- That of Spartacus!<br />It's most agreeable that Richard Jordan's portrayal of Confederate Brigadier Gen. Armisted was admirable; a complex part to play, considering Armisted's divided sympathies between both devotion to the State of Virginia and his love for the Union's Hancocks. What a performance Jordan handed in before he died! Not to mention Martin Sheen's equally admirable performance as Gen. Robert E. Lee - I must admit that I wouldn't go see Gettysburg because I didn't think Sheen would carry the role well: He's a dead-ringer for Gen. Ulysses S. Grant!! 1960s TV great Andrew Prine's return to the screen as Confederate General Garnett is as cool as Hitcher star C. Thomas Howell's Lieutenant Thomas Chamberlain (borther of Col. Chamberlain).<br />The action scenes in here were superbly done ... Little Round Top's surprised me, but Pickett's Charge in this film has no past comparison and is the most impressive I've ever seen: With few or no special effects, as Braveheart had aplenty, it pushed the envelope in dedication to the &quot;Passion of Gettysburg&quot; - so well carried out by the reactivated Civil War units on the same historical locations.<br />A film writer myself (Isn't everbody?), I watch this one repeatedly with envy of its conception and execution of materials in a manner consistent with actual historical context and human emotions.<br />Hesitant to see this movie because of Daniel's contemporary appearance in Dumb and Dumber, and Sheen's casting as Lee, I now realize what a fool I'd been - I couldn't wait to buy it on tape and anxiously pre-ordered it on DVD.
6305609691|5.0|I loved Apocalypse Now.It was about Captain Willard,a soldier in Vietnam who travels upriver to assasinate Colonel Kurtz,a renegade who is operarating on his own.I thought the film was very eerie as was the musical score,which was great.Martin Sheen did a fine job as Cpt.Willard,although I think Robert Duvall stole the show as an air cav Lt.Colonel.Marlon Brando did a good job,too,as Col.Kurtz,although he was only in the film for a short time and was always shown in the dark.The cinematography is excellent.Although the film doesn't show a lot of combat,it is my personal favorite about Vietnam.
B00004X01U|1.0|Sorry ... I really can't stand this CD.  It's totally empty and meaningless.  I enjoyed Ray Of Light a lot but this is really bad &quot;music&quot;.
B00004T9UF|4.0|don't get me wrong, its a great cd. its just that the real slim shady is SO overplayed that it turns out to be one of the MOST annoying songs there are...but if you get rid of it, then its a great eminem angry rap album...he is getting real good
B00004Y7SF|3.0|I went to buy this CD the first day it came out. I didn't know about duets with Billy Preston or Dr. John...They weren't on my CD. My CD has the original Chestnuts Song, The Holiday Mix of that, then the Xtina's Xmas, O Holy Night, These are Special Times, etc. No performing live for the President, no Silent Night in Spanglish, no Thunderpuss Remix. I would've liked it on my CD. If you want to know where I got mine from, I got it from Target. It does come with an enhanced CD feature, not sure what it is yet, though.
0440219078|4.0|I really felt this book is a must read for people of all ages!  The main reason is because I believe that within Lowis Lowry's THE GIVER, everyone can find something to relate to.    For example, Jonas, the main character, is very worried about his future life, like many people are.  From another view, Jonas also seems to feel left out, a feeling many younger people and adolescents can relate to.  Another aspect of this book that I feel should strike a chord with anyone and everyone who reads it, is how wonderful it is to have variety.  Just as had happened in the book, everyone ended up with the same birthday, not being able to see colors... dressing alike etc.  Thank God we don't have to worry about that!    I feel that people, when reading this book should focus on the feelings that Jonas experiences when being the Giver's tutoree... so to speak.  He goes from confusion to understanding- from sadnees to overwhelming joy.  The spectrum of emotion that Lowry reflects is amazing!
B00004XOWM|2.0|Limp Bizkit is one of those bands that makes a lot of fantastic noise, but whose message is ultimately weakened by dumb lyrics. Sometimes the lead singer of a band whose message is ambiguous can get away with it by saying something like &quot;our message is just to not give a f---!&quot; Lots of true hardcore bands do this all the time, but unfortunately for Limp Bizkit, Fred Durst has neither the vocal talent nor writing skills to pull it off. Listening to this CD just reinforces my opinion that his lyrics don't mean anything, and he falls into that horrible black hole that inferior songwriters sometimes reach when their goal in using certain words in their songs just stems from an effort to &quot;rhyme&quot; and not because the lyrics actually make sense. Fred Durst also seems to suffer from that type of amnesia where he forgets exactly who he is. He seems to think that just because he did some work with real rappers, he is all of a sudden this &quot;true mc&quot; with actual street credibility. Don't get me wrong -- the fact that Fred Durst is a horrible rapper isn't because he's a white man. In fact, there are great mainstream white rappers out there, like Eminem and Everlast (and the list is steadily growing), who easily put Fred Durst to shame. Fred Durst is horrible as a rapper because he can't write meaningful lyrics, and his voice is whiney and repetetive... I guess you can call that his &quot;style.&quot; The remaining members of Limp Bizkit, however, are very talented and should seriously consider disassociating themselves from Fred Durst to continue making their hard-edge music, unless they really like the idea of becoming another Nickolodeon prepubescent kiddie band, liked only by naive children who don't know &quot;real&quot; music, and just want to pretend that they do.
B0000248L1|5.0|This is a stunning debut album from one of Thrash Metal's most innovative bands.  It is packed with ideas that the band made their trademark, complex riffs, wacky solos and melodic clean guitar passages.<br />The opening track, &quot;Crystal Ann&quot;, demonstrates the classical background that Jeff Waters came from.  A beautiful instrumental showing an amazing sense of melody and structure.  How many thrash bands can play like this???<br />The anthemic &quot;Alison Hell&quot; is one of Annihilators most classic songs, this reworking of the 1986 Phantasmagoria demo track is outstanding!<br />Throughout the album the band show that nobody can play schizo-metal as well as they can.  Full of classics including &quot;Human Insecticide&quot;, &quot;WTYD&quot; and &quot;Schizo's are never alone: Parts 1 &amp; 2&quot; this is an essential addition to any metal collection.

B00000ADG2|5.0|Now the joy of our lives is in Zion....I hate to admit, but this girl deserved her victory, so real it makes Andrea Bocelli seem horrible. <br />The reason?<br />Where Andrea Bocelli is a singer who often sings songs written by others (he occasionally writes his own material), Lauryn writes her own all the time. Proof that she's a &quot;real&quot; artist. But then it makes me seem like an idiot because I don't plan on singing.
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I thought U-571 was fantastic.  It was exciting from start to finish.  I feel this film was meant more for entertainment than a history lesson.  It had suspence, trajody, and excitement. It keeps you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie.   Lets face it we always want the Americans to win.  If you want to be entertained then see this movie.  This movie shows that you can't rely on just knowing what to do.  You have to have the guts to do it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is a GREAT cd if you're into Pop music..if you're into sorry stuff like hip-hop and rap go elswhere --&gt; For real entertainment go for anything Britney! I love this CD and I never tire of it or the awesome boppy beat that always makes me dance! I give this CD 5 stars because it deserves it...and plus, Britney Rocks! Her voice is great and her talent plus her personality far exceeds that of any current pop or hip-hop artist currently out there. Make way for the next Janet Jackson! Wooh-hoo!
078322804X|5.0|Blues Brothers, a classic for its time.  It has great actors, like john candy, cab calloway, dan akroyd, and of course john belushi. this is a movie that is not to be missed.
B00004Z459|5.0|After hearing the single &quot;One Step Closer&quot; on the radio, I had to get this CD!  Needless to say, I was hooked....I can't get it out of my head.  Every track on the album is well worth listening to; which, in today's &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot; age, that's not an easy thing to accomplish.  Songs like Crawling,In the End, and Papercut keep you coming back for more.  A must Get!
0345350499|5.0|I read this book when I was about 14 (6 yrs ago), and I have to say it still remains one of the most memorable novels I have ever read. Disturbing in so many ways, yet so captivating that, even when you're hating it, you're loving it.  I love how these romantic, legendary characters are faced with all these eerie psychological, and very much contradictory issues.  This is definetely a new perspective to the arthurian legend, and specially of Morgane.  A book that will inspire opionions even from those indifferent to sci-fi novels.
B0000026NC|5.0|Can I just say, the reviewers who have expressed a prefference for Pulse over this album must be deaf and mad.<br />Delicate sound of thunder is THE live Floyd album (OK Ummagumma is partly live but Syd Barrett's Floyd were never really suited to live recordings). It was released on the back of two of their best albums - Wish You Were Here and Momentary Lapse Of Reason and features many of the strongest tracks from both albums. The inclusion of some tracks from The Wall/Final Cut add nicely to the overall feel of this album.<br />I remember when The Wall came out and 'die hard' fans moaned that it was too mainstream-rock and said that Floyd had sold out. Delicate Sound showed that while they were no longer the band they once were they had become something just as interesting and powerfully moving. This album and the tour it was recorded on showed the so called 'giants of rock' that Pink Floyd could still kick ass on stage.<br />Unfortuanately Pulse though it features much of the same material is a pale comparison produced only to pander to the yuppie market with their characteristic lack of taste and knowledge. It isn't even really Pink Floyd - most of the band have left and been replaced with sessionists. I would recommend Delicate Sound to anyone interested in knowing what (post-Syd) Floyd are all about, Pulse on the other hand is an album only for completists and I am scornful of anyone who owns it as their only Floyd album.
068818071X|4.0|Well, I'm not gonna bore with long dissertations, suffice to say, this book was a long long time coming, and as Ms. Keyes, a writer like myself, says &quot;It was often painful to write.&quot; VERY painful at times to read as well,So why write it? For the purging. Whether u are an addictive personality or not, it jolts u into a deeper awareness than I feel years of counseling could do. It is, as Keyes usually writes, multi-faceted and laced with such sexy sexy humor that you don't fall apart crying on nearly every page. Her work has gotten much more maudlin and 'deep', yet this remains a book which I, as a published author, hold tight to my chest in love and thankfulness for the understanding! It DOES lead you to wonder, since isn't all our fiction writing based on fact? Was   Ms. Keyes writing this from a  'research based point of view'only, without personal experience? I would be very surprised and impressed.  Mixed emotions here about this  very lengthy 'read', but well worth it if you need some REAL questions about your  emotions and behavior answered!     with love and authorship, wendy w.. cleveland
0783235607|5.0|&quot;Psycho&quot; isn't a horror film, or rather it isn't a horror film in the modern sense of the word. Rather than being a simple, thoughtless predecessor of such mindless slasher films like &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;Psycho&quot; is a shocking, deeply disturbing, and very thought-provoking character study of a seemingly benign madman. The film is based on a novel by Robert Bloch, which in turn was based on a true series of murders. Bloch finished the book before the investigation reached completion and anything was known about the murderer (thus Norman - &quot;neither woman nor man&quot;), the accuracy of Bloch's prediction is truly stunning, and Alfred Hitchcock's ability to portray the events so artfully is more disturbing still.<br />Marion Crane, a secretary at a realty agency sees the chance of a lifetime when a rich customer buys a house for his daughter and pays the full sum in cash. Our heroine takes off with the money, but since she has no clue what to do she begins to panic. Racing out of town, switching cars, she is forced to slow down after two days of driving by an awful rainstorm. Marion misses an intersection and stops at Bates Motel (&quot;twelve cabins - twelve vacancies&quot;), which is owned by a shy, but very enthusiastic young man - Norman Bates. There is no one else for miles away, except his reclusive and apparently senile mother who lives in a brooding, dark house nearby. Then Marion disappears...<br />&quot;Psycho&quot; lulls the viewer into a sense of safety by making its central antagonist the most affable character in the film, and perhaps in the existance of films. Anthony Perkins is unbelievable in the role of Norman Bates. Hitchcock's genius is timeless; in fact, the movie has even more of an impact now, years after it was made, since many things in it seem hopelessly outdated, but the shocking message remains as powerful as always.<br />The film starts out very slowly, perhaps even tempting you to stop watching, since several scenes look like amateurish atempts to establish tension (the policeman scene, for example). I knew the outcome before watching, but I still came away totally devastated. For the fans of trivia, Seymore Skinner from &quot;The Simpsons&quot; is almost entirely based on Norman Bates, and there were a few scenes on the show that are parodies of scenes from the movie.
B0000024YL|5.0|I didn't grow up with these two incredible musicians, so I'm not sure what their motivation was behind their music, but I love it. The first time I ever really experienced the power of Paul Simon's voice was when watching a rerun of Saturday Night Live when he performed with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, and I got hooked. I bought the CD mainly for Mrs. Robinson, but I knew of some of the other songs, and fell in love with the rest. This album covers a wide range of emotions from the upbeat &quot;Cecilia&quot; to the mellow &quot;Scarborough Fair/ Canticle&quot;, and from the motivational &quot;I Am a Rock&quot; to the feel-good &quot;Mrs. Robinson.&quot; I cannot say enough good things about this album. S&amp;G harmonize beautifully, and the sound quality is incredible. My only complaint is that &quot;Kodachrome&quot; isn't on this album, but other than that, this CD is perfect.
B00000J7SS|3.0|I am a huge fan of Davis but this is not him.  I am used to those classics like kind of blue but this CD totally changes his sound.  While it does sound ok, it is not Mile Davis at all and I would not recomend it for a person who likes his other CD's.
B00003CWL6|1.0|One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Even Kevin Spacey couldn't save it. Judging by some of the other reviews I'm not alone. What they should have done is save everything the kid next door in the movie shot with his camcorder and just use that footage then throw the rest of the movie away. I've never seen such a bad story or worse acting. Shame on the studio for offering this trash to the movie going (and buying) public. Oscars? You've got to be kidding.
B00003CWNR|3.0|John Irving used to write great books - not many works that belong to a \\"Modern Fiction\\" shelf sell in millions. But the novels' inhabitants - the endearing misfits having their clashes with reality -  had a very bad time translating into movie characters. Robin Williams as Garp is just a huge tasteless joke.<br />The author's later offerings are less memorable and way too long. They feel stillborn, lifeless, though there are still some glimpses of John Irving we love. I've stopped reading his books with The Son Of The Circus. When a new novel comes out I leaf through it for an hour and put back on the shelf - I'd like to remember the writer in his prime.<br />I had a definite impression that John Irving drifts into obscurity, into the void of artsy vagueness. And all of a sudden I see him clutching the golden guy with a sword, riding the Oscar hypewave. <br />The author made a script out of his last great novel, leaving all the originality behind. What we have now is the simplistic Coming Of Age/Period Piece Hollywood movie that tackle for a couple minutes some serious issues. Michael Cain is good, he delivers \\"the performance you can always rely on\\". He is evidently out of his league in this cast. Toby McGuire is a nice young actor, but he seem to have just one facial expression available and the more times he puts it on the less endearing it looks. Evidently, Charlize Theron has not arrived to the stage, where she is no longer required to sell a film with her body - which is perfectly OK with me, but that the-beauty-spreads-across-the-sheets scene looks like a bonus.<br />Well, to make it shorter - I do not regret seeing the movie  just as I would not regret skipping it.
6303942830|4.0|This epic, sprawling film is beautifully crafted and well-acted, but if you are looking for the film to serve as Cliffs Notes for James Fenimore Cooper's novel, I suggest that you look elsewhere.  Several drastic changes have been made to the plot and main characters.  The core of the story remains in a diluted form, but it has definitely been Hollywoodized into a decidedly more romantic, predictable variation on Cooper's novel.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for artistic license, I just don't want anyone waltzing into their literature class with a fastidious comment about the symbolism in Hawkeye and Cora's love affair, when it does not even exist in the novel.  See the film for entertainment, just don't mistake it for the book.
B000002AQQ|5.0|THIS CD IS OFF THE HOOK TO! ALL THESE OLD SONGS LIKE SWEET HOME ALABAMA....OOOO I LOVE IT AND IM ONLY 16! BUY IT IF YOU LOVE THE GOOD OLD SONGS THAT YOU NEVER HEAR! SOME COOL PARTY SONGS ON IT TO! GREAT FOR KEGERS!
0684853523|4.0|To write, or not to write.  King prefers the former, and his newest book on writing (pun unintentional) captures King's opinion about what makes good writing.  As an avid reader of King's writing, this non-fictional account is a success.  It clearly relates enough memoir without the long, depressing incidents of his &quot;wrecked&quot; years. The section of the book entitled &quot;On Writing&quot; gives the reader a taste of Strunk and White with a main course in King's preferences and aviodances in writing fiction.  I enjoyed the section on adverb use and King's sharp sense of humor.  The book belongs in any reader/writer's toolbox. Steve, I am sure, would bask in the light of my anxiously avoided adverbs(OOOPS!).
B00003CXFG|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this film because the visual effects were spectacular. It is worth buying for that aspect alone.  I also enjoyed watching Vin Diesel act.  He put on a very good &quot;tough guy&quot; performance, and although the plot was not oscar-worthy, the movie made up for it in the action scenes.  I am also eager to see the deleted scenes on this movie.  I can imagine that this DVD will be in many people's collections.
B00004STPT|5.0|I bought this soundtrack soon after I saw the movie, and it blew me away.  There are a few tracks in particular that stand out -- track # 3 (the battle), #9 (The Might of Rome), and #13(Barbarian Horde).  I felt these tracks did a great job at portraying the atmosphere of the movie.  They invoke a sense of dignity and honor about the situations they portray, which is what I think Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrad were trying to do.  The CD is also well put together, and there is a good selection of music from the film.  I have baught many movie soundtracks, and this is one of my favorites of all time.  The length is also just right - 61 minutes of great music.  Virtus et Honos!
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Christina has put together quite a nice Christmas album!  It is very diverse, with all musical styles including pop, r&amp;b, gospel, blues and dance.  This album starts to hint at the well rounded artist that many people believe Christina will be in the future.<br />Here is my review of each song:<br />01. Christmas Time &amp; 02. This Year - The first two songs are as far as I know original songs which sound similar to Christina's hits from her first album with a pop/r&amp;b feel.  Very nice.<br />  03. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas - A heartfelt version of the Christmas classic.<br />04. Angels We Have Heard On High - Starts out with a kind of reggae feel, then turns into a full blown gospel romp with an awesome backing choir.<br />  05. Merry Christmas, Baby - A blues number in the vein of B.B. King.  This really shows Christina's verstility as a singer.  She really belts it out on this one!  I hope she sings more blues in the future.<br />  06. O Holy Night - Starts with the traditional sound (ala Mariah Carey's version) and then takes a turn towards the end to a more gospel flavor.<br />07. These Are The Special Times - A more r&amp;b remake of Celine Dion's original recording from her Christmas album last year.<br />08. This Christmas - Another remake of a classic.  Another fantastic vocal performance! <br />09. The Christmas Song - The slow version of this Christmas classic as she sung it for the President last year. <br />  10. Xtina's Xmas - A cool interlude-like jam that is mostly instrumental.<br />  11. The Christmas Song (Holiday Remix) - Released last year as a special holiday release single.<br />Overall, Christina just sonds amazing on this album - a real treat! This Christmas album will be popular with young and old alike for years to come!
B00004Z459|5.0|I heard about this band from a friend and went out and got it the day it came out.  I was completely amazed by what i heard.  This band has a lot going for them, unbelievible talent.  Definitely buy this if you are a fan of any type of rock or metal.
B000005RS7|5.0|This has got to be Kate's best album to date!  She has continued to keep her off-beat, theatrical style, adding a twist  to make it fit her musical maturity.  It is a piece that takes you on a journey through every aspect of humanity. From the calming lullaby of &quot;And Dream Of Sheep&quot; to the frightening portrayal of torment and dispair in &quot;Waking the Witch&quot;, you just don't know where she will take you next.  The drama of Kate's musical genius engulfs this 1985 release and truly emphasizes her talent.  Kate has used every ounce of her passionately unusual spirit to bring us an absolutely mesmerizing masterpiece!
B00004YRQA|5.0|The new 8MB Memory Cards are great! The origanl ones for Playstation are 1MB. These are great for any kind of game. You should at least have one of them. People might think they don't look as fancy as the Dreamcast's Visual Memory Unit, but the truth is they are much faster and store much more data. If you can't get one by Sony get one from any third party compony.  Sony's are of better quality and efficiency, but if you can't get a hold of one just take anything available.
B000002UV1|5.0|I purchased Mother's Milk at the dawn of a very experimental period in my life, musically speaking. It immediately established itself as a &quot;I know what I was doing when&quot; album. When I heard the first searing notes of &quot;Good time boys&quot; in my bean bag chair in 1989, my life changed forever. Fantastic album in many ways, with &quot;Knock me Down&quot; and &quot;Johnny, Kick a Hole in the Sky&quot; being the standout Peppers standards. Note to Amazon reviewer:  The cover of &quot;Fire&quot; features Hillel Slovak on guitar, not John Frusciante. It was recorded quite a few years before Mother's Milk.
0399146253|2.0|I have been a big fan of Cornwell and Scarpetta.  This book was a big disappointment.  I prefer a murder mystery.  The story was focusing on Scarpetta's damaged psyche.
B000002NAK|4.0|Every time I listen to this soundtrack I am more and more impressed by the orchestrations done by Andrew Lloyd Webber and David Cullen. One of the nicest things about turning a Broadway musical into a Hollywood film is that you finally have a full studio orchestra playing the music instead of just the musicians you can afford to stuff into the orchestra pit in the theater. Even so, the original cast album of &quot;Evita&quot; did feature a full string section on &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina.&quot; But the added orchestration on this soundtrack is absolutely awesome and it is not just a question of having more instruments. Some of my appreciation is for the little things I notice in the background, such as the castanets that pop up in &quot;Oh What a Circus,&quot; the flutes in the intro to &quot;Goodnight and Thank You,&quot; and the honky-tonk piano in &quot;The Lady's Got Potential.&quot; Apparently Lloyd Webber thought about this a lot during all those years &quot;Evita&quot; was in pre-production. The credits say Cullen provided &quot;Additional Orchestrations,&quot; so there is some question of who actually gets credit for what, but wherever the line of demarcation falls this is as nice a job of adapting a musical to film that you will ever hear.<br />The vocal liabilities of the singers are much more noticeable on the CD than they are when you are watching the film. Madonna has never been a particularly strong singer, but power has never been the key to her performance anyhow. I keep getting the feeling she is falling behind the pace on the fast songs, particularly &quot;Eva Beware of the City,&quot; which only highlights her strength in the slower numbers and from that perspective she pretty much nails &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina,&quot; which is the one song she has to nail. Of course, there are the inevitable comparisons to Patti LuPone, and I have to wonder if I think Madonna's best effort is on &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; because it is more suited to her vocal stylings than LuPone or because I never heard anybody else sing that particular song. But then the first time I heard &quot;Don't Cry For Me Argentina&quot; Karen Carpenter sang it with opera singers doing the intro part, so there. Similarly, Antonio Banderas does not have the same impact as he does on film, where his expressive looks and gestures provide so much of the nuance of his meaning in singing any given line (e.g., &quot;On What a Circus&quot;). Jonathan Pryce really does not have all that much to sing in this show, but his few moments certainly match the emotion tenor of each scene (e.g., &quot;She is a Diamond&quot;). Jimmy Nail sounds (and looks) to young to be Evita's ticket out of the sticks, even though he is technically the best singer in the group (&quot;On This Night of a Thousand Stars&quot;). However, the additional vocalists are all obviously younger than the actors lip-syncing in the film, so at least there is consistency.<br />All this being said, I have to say I do not think it incredibly strange than when I listen to this album at home I tend to put on the DVD rather than the CD. Not only do I get to see the visual dimension that is so important to these performances, but the beautiful cinematography. Besides, the deathbed sequences were done live so what was recorded for the CD was never used in the film.

B00003Q43A|5.0|Hi, I am sure you know of the plot by now but I will ive a short summary. Independence Day is about a LARGE colony of aliens who invade our planet. The aliens are relentless and they could be to much for us. So, the entire message of the film is unity amoung us, as humans. Will Smith, Harry Connick JR., Bill Pullman and a list of others star in the film.<br />My DVD Review...<br />WOW, I do not think I have ever seen on a DVD so much stuff. The first disc contains the Theatrical version and the Special edition with over 9 minutes of extra footage.  The second disc contains mucho material. It is everything a DVD collector would want. I just wish a lot of other DVD's would contain the same.<br />What the Disc contains, but this is just from memory so I will not of listed all of them. An HBO special I think, hosted by Jeff Goldblum the star of the film, Inside ID4, very extensive footage on the making of the buildings, such as the White House, New York buildings and the aliens, that was a really great segment. Also, the spaceships were shown in their irst stages of development, on draft paper and then in the modeling process.<br />There were ALOT more, I suggest you should really view the DVD's. Even if you do not like the movie, the time and effort put into the second disc is just worth it right there. I would really recommend you see this DVD set and a note on the deleted plane scene to the directors, thank you, thank you! Just kidding.<br />Thanks for reading,<br />Ryan
0399146253|4.0|Well, it's about time.  After dealing with the fallout from Black Notice - TLP picks up where BN ended - Kay Scarpetta FINALLY (we hope) decides to get on with her life instead of maundering about and wailing and gnashing her teeth over the loss of Benton.  <br />I picked up this book fully expecting it to be better than BN (which was damn near unreadable), and it was, in nearly all respects.  Kay goes through a lot here.  It often seems as though she's groping through a maze, what with nothing and no one being what they seem, and layers upon layers of suspicions, paranoia, deceptions, etc. etc. etc.  However, she has to get through this before she can move forward, as I have been waiting for her to do since Point of Origin.  Readers who are paying attention will get a clue as to who's behind all of this very early on in the story.  I won't give it away here!  I am actually looking forward to Patricia Cornwell's next Scarpetta story - she seems to have written herself out of the mire and is ready to fly!  One complaint I have, though, is the endings just seem to come too fast.

B000002UAX|4.0|THIS ALBUM HOLDS UP EVEN TODAY. IT IS A GREAT ALBUM FROM A GREAT GROUP.
B00003TL49|5.0|What was already a perfect album (I rate 'When the pawn' the finest album of 1999) is made better by the release of this Import CD.<br />Understandably, the only reason to get this is because of Fiona's cover of The Beatles' classic 'Across the Universe'. This song has long been regarded an uncoverable piece because the original was so pristine and incomparable, but Fiona takes it and makes it all her own. To me, this version sounds far better than the original.<br />The other track here, 'Never is a promise', which gave birth to a website of its' own, has been heard before, and isn't really groundbreaking - but when listened to in the album's entirety, it makes perfect sense! It blends in beautifully, and is quite an achievement.<br />A definite must-have piece for any serious Fiona collector. Highly recommended.
B00000K3G8|3.0|I love the band, and love this cd (saw them on the '83 tour in Charlotte NC,  and they were incredible. One of my favorite bands for sure. BUT, I agree with Pop Kulcher above, where is the CD version of &quot;The Name Of This Band Is Talking Heads&quot;  from about '81 or '82?  It is without doubt one of the best live albums ever.  (I've only got it on vinyl).  The early stuff expecially is out of this world, like &quot;Don't worry about the Government&quot; and then the mid period pieces like &quot;Artists Only&quot; ; and all was so very well produced and sonically beautiful!  Though it wasn't a hit at the time, it's great - Please someone re-release this beautiful album.  It's one of my all- time favorite albums. Does anyone else from then miss it?  It's incredible. Anyway, Stop Makning Sense is good, but nowhere near this one. Keep expressing,   Richard
630562285X|2.0|A little more attention to detail would have helped this move considerably.  <br />A few examples:  We are given more than ample reason early on in the movie to believe that Catherine Zeta-Jones' character is totally unafraid of heights, and yet a pivotal end scene sees her suddenly fearful of being up too high.  Even ignoring the all-too-frequent action movie plot device of having the main female character responsible for screwing up the male character's plans by being fearful or foolish, this error highlights the problems that arise when scripts are written by committee.<br />Later, the famous scene that finds Zeta-Jones wending her way through a series of lasers--meant to serve as burglar alarms--also finds her dragging her leg through one of the beams to no effect.  Careless editing is probably to blame here.  Also problematic in this scene is that the elaborate ploy concocted to steal an artifact by tunneling through a floor and then struggling through the laser-maze leaves this viewer wondering why the burglars didn't simply emerge through the floor immediately in front of the plundered object rather than all the way across the room, thus avoiding the lasers entirely.  Had they done this, of course, the previous 45 minutes of the movie would be rendered pointless.<br />All of these casual errors point to a movie made formulaically and somewhat casually, with more attention paid to effects and the stars' sex appeal than to feasability or plot.  And while I find both Connery and Zeta-Jones as sexy as the next person, their appeal, even coupled with some fairly fantastic effects in the Malaysia-based scenes and a series of genuinely surprising plot twists (that did, however, leave one feeling they were invented sheerly for the sake of making the movie convoluted), could not keep me interested in the tangled and sagging plot for the length of the entire picture.
B0000064TT|4.0|I've always loved this album.  Very beautiful, well produced and varied.  Saw them live about '79  at the College of Charleston, a peak event in my concert going (Also there, I beleive were Papa John Creach and Vassar Clements - an awesome time).  Anyway , this one never lets you down.
B00004YW6I|4.0|My introduction to PJ Harvey has begun at last after years of hearing her name bounce around with the hierarchy of musical supremos. &quot;Stories from the city, Stories from the sea&quot; is a spellbinding mix of angst ridden joy deflated ambient folksy pop blues and the first of her albums which I own. PJ Harvey's voice simple stuns it's way along 12 tracks of love lost, love longed, love found and love shredded beyond recognition. &quot;Big Exit&quot; opens the preceedings with a sense of anticipation and excitement as Polly Jane blazes her way into the core of the album and throws in the greatest line of the album &quot;I'm immortal when I'm with you&quot;, Oh yes this is gonna be good. &quot;Good Fortune&quot; carries on with the uplift and battles it's way into the seat of most poppy of the albums' listing. Then &quot;The Mess We're In&quot; brings Thom Yorke to the fore and this duet on many an album, with the juxtaposition of these two marvelously derranged voices, would serve as its pinnacle yet on this album it but just adds to the ride. &quot;Kamikaze&quot; is a quick sharp shock of a track as the name would suggest which lands us straight into &quot;This is Love&quot;  the most upbeat of all the tracks where Harvey pleased to find love quickly tries to keep it a secret, Oh she's good! The last two offical tracks on the album &quot;Horses In My Dream&quot; and &quot;We Float&quot; replace the secret love with offical torment and end the album on a more melancholy theme but before you turn away let the silence at the end play as there's the all important hidden track which ladies and gentlemen is ... well you make your mind up.
B00004Z459|4.0|When i first heard the song &quot;One Step Closer&quot; i was hooked on this band.  They are so original, and i knew i was going to get their album the first day it came out.  I did, and i was not disapointed.  Their sound is very original, and are going to go a long way.  They are one of the best rock groups to come out in a while.  Every song on the album is worth listening to.
B00004XONN|5.0|All of us true Radiohead fans know the real genius behind them is the ability to innovate.  Every lp so far has made the last seem like a band of minstrels.  This is no exception.  I can't believe something can make OK Computer sound old, but it's true.  The sounds of Kid A are lucid, they seem celestial in nature and allow you to almost see the music.  I read another review that used a Kubrick analogy.  I don't disagree, Kid A manages to haunt, inspire, and astound all at the same time.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Savage Garden outdid their first album with this one. I just can't get enough of Darren's beautiful vocals and Daniel's fabulous guitar skills. Not to mention that both Darren and Daniel wrote all their songs!! The title track, &quot;Affirmation&quot;, is my all time favorite song out there. And it's not like my music collection is limited (Garth Brooks, U2, Mozart, Tom Petty, Billy Joel, ect.) either! I went to their concert when they were in town and they blew me away with their showmanship, their energy, and their emotion. If you need a CD to cover great music, touching lyrics, and rousing rhythms.....this is your dream come true! (I know it is mine.)
B000002HPV|5.0|This album has proven to be a breakthrough release for the Icelandic siren.  Bjork proves that her music is both intellectual and highly danceable. &quot;Hunter&quot; and &quot;Alarm Call&quot; are two of my favorite songs.  Both of these titles showcase some lyrics which prove to be a bit revealing for this extremely gifted singer and song writer.  I can listen to this cd over and over again while simpy reading, driving in the car, or chatting with friends.  An artistic work of many moods and modulations.  A very worth while purchase for just about any cd collection!
6303168507|1.0|In which Steven Spielberg replicates Ophuls's &quot;Sorrow and the Pity&quot; with all the subtlety of &quot;The Color Purple&quot; or &quot;1941.&quot; This film proved to be the signpost of the decade, in which technical superiority reigns over the film itself. Spielberg grabs the audience and forces emotion down it's collective throat. Vile, insincere, and a thin-veiled attempt at an Academy Award (albeit successful). Spielberg is saved by his ace cinematographer, Janusz Kaminski, and a top-flight cast.
0553573403|4.0|A Game of Thrones is an imaginative book. Its better than Robert Jordan's over-hyped and badly-written Wheel of Time; and it comes near my favorite fantasy books (LOTR and His Dark Materials by Pullman).<br />Lots of well-developed characters exist, and are rather realistic at that. The literature isn't solely escapist as a lot of fantasy is, but it also has that subtle element of magic which makes it a fantasy book.<br />The only problem I found was that sometimes the relationships between people became too convoluted, and also the magical elemnt sometimes seemed to be forgotten. Otherwise this is a good read.
B00004XONN|4.0|Whether or not you were a Radiohead fan previous to this release it doesn't matter- chances are you are not going to love this album.  So why then give this album four stars? Well, its simple really.  This is great music folks.  Will you love it and play it over and over.  Maybe not. <br />Kid A is like one of those movies that you can admire and be in agreement with the Academy for receiving loads of Oscars.  It really is a great art piece.  All of this doesn't make for great entertainment of course.  For example, Top Gun, in my view, is a great movie and one that I can watch over and over when it is on TBS because it is so entertaining.  Is it art? No.  But that doesn't mean its empty.   <br />Lets get into Kid A's tracks.  The highlights for me are: Everything In Its Right Place (a great opener), How To Completely Disappear (a beautiful song that transports you to another place if you let it), Optmistic (weighty, clunky rock song with great vocals), Idioteque (anxious and beautiful vocals and Motion Picture Soundtrack (a beautiful song that as the title suggest would work brilliantly in a film).  In my opinion, the rest of the songs, while very respectable from a musical standpoint, just don't do it for me from a listening standpoint.  These songs make great background music, but would I ever pull out Kid A from my CD collection to play Treefingers? No.  In Limbo? No.  The song Kid A? you guessed it...No.  <br />So here is the dilemna.  Do you penalize an album that you admire, but do not love just because the songs don't excite you.  I handled it by giving Kid A four stars.  However, just don't expect to hear great songs with heart when you buy this album.  There are a few, but what this album really is is great music.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|Lenny can rock; don't get me wrong. I saw him at Radio City Music Hall in 1993 and it was spectacular. And I bought Let Love Rule in 1989 after the 1st time I heard it. But to my ears he's been treading water since &quot;Are You Gonna Go My Way.&quot; He has never really developed beyond a skilled impersonator with great tastes (especially in Plastic Ono Band-era John Lennon) into a true original, and I always thought he would. And of late it seems he's become less rock &amp; roller and more of a VH1/Tommy Hilfiger fashion plate, embraced by the in-crowd who think he's just &quot;fabulous&quot; and probably think it's Lenny when a Sly &amp; the Family Stone or Curtis Mayfield song comes on the radio or jukebox. Nevertheless, he's got a bunch of great tunes, many of which are here. Personally, I'd suggest you pick up his first 3 records; there's a bunch of great tunes on them that aren't on the greatest hits record: Stop Draggin' Around, Is There Any Love in Your Heart, Freedom Train, Flower Child, etc. But I'm sure this comp will become a ubiquitous presence at the upcoming plethora of yuppie holiday parties.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|What is there to say about Lenny Kravitz?  His combination of rock and roll, funk, seventies style and attitude and brilliant musicianship and song writing talent make just about anything he creates fabulous.  This Greatest Hits collection is no exception. Each song on this CD is another shining example of why Lenny has achieved the success he has (all of it well deserved).<br />The ballads, the rockers, the funk- its all here...except for &quot;Thinking of You&quot; which Lenny wrote for his mother and on which his love for her really comes through.  Everything from the remake of &quot;American Woman&quot; to the earlier stuff like &quot;Let Love Rule&quot; is covered.<br />My only complaint about this CD is that except for the new song &quot;Again&quot; I already have all of these.  It is nice to have them all on one CD however.<br />So for those of you new comers to Lenny's work, this is a great CD where you can get a flavor for all of the favorites you know and some of the others you might not.  For those of you who already own all of Lenny's previous stuff- pick this up for the new song and the convenience of having all the other greats on one CD.<br />Enjoy.
0316286443|5.0|I have not purchased the book, but plan to do so today.  I browsed through the book yesterday in a salon where I was getting my hair cut.  My hairdresser and I were astonished at the magnificent transformations.  Kevyn is extremely gifted.  Not only does he change the look of people, but has step by step instructions on how to achieve each look.  Kevyn is truly a sensational artist.
0446677450|3.0|I thought the book had more to do with investing in real estate in a down market (like Phoenix) and hoping it comes up rather than being a teacher of actionable items - I found the audio 1-hour on the internet very informative and hit more of the highlights rather than being a salesman for the board game.  If the author highlights that he does not need to write books or games for the 'money', then I question why are not the profits from sales go to a good cause.  More action items are needed but does start you thinking about other types of investing.
B000002B7O|5.0|There is no doubt about it, this album is THE best Ozzy album. Many do say Blizzard of Ozz is the best, but I beg to differ.<br />Not only is this CD the last one with Randy, so it sets a kinda eerie mood, but it also happens to be one of the best written albums by anyone; and the best of Ozzy. This album has it all. Happy, uptempo songs(Flying High Again, Little Dolls), depressive, moody songs(Believer, Diary of a madman), and the remarkable playing of Randy Rhoads.  Unfortunately, his playing on this is overshadowed because of speedy production, and poor overdubbing of the guitar.  But overall, this album is buyable because of the title track. A lenghty 6 or 7 minute song, it changes itself so many times that it seems theatrical. The bridge before the solo is the best part! <br />So if you are looking for a great CD that will leave you feeling like you got your moneys worth, this album is for you.
B000002BMV|5.0|Journey's Escape and Survivor's Vital Signs are my all time favorite 80s rock album. Why do they stand out from the rest of 80s rock masterpieces?<br />First of all, they are excellently produced. Not only their tracks are excellent, but the combination of their track order give each track brilliance. First track Don't Stop Believing wrap up the concept of the album just as I Can't Hold Back of Vital Signs does. Stone In Love gives Steve Perry's high tone irresistble allure. Superb contrast of slow ballad Open Arms and uptempo rocker Keep On Running. During 80s many rock bands tried to emulate these two giants without success. If you like Vital Signs and When Seconds Count you will definitely love this album. Can we find such a great rock now? I am still searching.

0671578855|5.0|If you are a Miles Vorkosigan fan, then you don't need any review beyond - Wow! Bujold has outdone herself.  'Nuff said.<br />If you have no idea who this Miles guy is or why he has such a funny last name, please, please, PLEASE do NOT start with this book.  Start with Shards of Honor or Barrayar or even The Vor Game, but not here with this book.<br />Oh, I don't doubt A Civil Campaign can stand on its own as an entertaining read, but even so, the climax of this book cannot possibly be nearly as satisfying if you don't know all the background.  Don't cheat yourself.
B00004X0Q0|3.0|In/Casino/Out.  At The Drive-In/Aassee Lake Split.  Vaya.  These are the records of a band transforming itself into a major creative force.  Relationship of Command, however, is an unfortunate mutation.  The blame for this glaring genetic mishap lies squarely on shoulders of the producer, CRAP MONGER EXTRAODINAIRE, Ross Robinson.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the producer that brought you such steaming piles of excrement as Korn's self-titled debut and the follow up 'Life is Peachy.'  As well as, the frat boy anthems on Limp Bizkit's 'Three dolla Bill Y'all.'  Lest we forget, the gimmick-laden shenanigans of the self titled SlipKnot debut (incidentally, he is also their A&amp;R guy).  Why a person with a career this repulsive was allowed to produce a band as melodic and creative as At The Drive-In, is beyond all decency.  If I were a conspiracy theorist I would say that the record industry feared an ensuing onslaught of political and consumer activism that is part and parcel of the At The Drive-In aesthetic and fan base.  But that sounds silly, doesn't it?  In his arrogance, Ross Robinson, couldn't leave the ATDI boys well enough alone.  His first debacle was to drench all of the instruments in a thick spew of sticky reverb.  This constrains the immediacy and urgency that is essential to the ATDI sound.  Then if that isn't enough, he thickens the sound of the guitars.  This results in pulling them away from their hardcore/punk leanings and migrating them toward Robinson's own rock/metal tendencies.  For a cherry-on-top finale, Robinson drags in Iggy Pop's post-Stooges corpse for the track 'rolodex propaganda.'  The song is great and it has very little to do with Iggy Pop's operatic warblings.  The novelty of his presence is unnecessary, misplaced and insulting.  These are the signatures of a person who is responsible for helping to inspire the worst abomination in the last decade of music.  That creative abortion known in the press as Rock/Rap/Metal.  Now it seems Robinson has gotten his diseased clutches on ATDI.  Fortunately, their song writing is strong and their energy is high on this record.  In fact, that is what makes you listen to it more than once.  Maybe they were foreseeing their collaboration with Robinson when they wrote 'Napoleon Solo' (In/Casino/Out), one of the greatest anthems of the last decade, in which they said &quot;You can't get the best of us now because this is forever.&quot;
0788821075|3.0|Pretty Woman is a popular and very familiar movie meant for a popular audience, the main attraction being the charisma of its two box-office buffos, Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.<br />I always feel a certain sense of interest when anticipating a Richard Gere film.  I know that in some way he will be slick and sleazy (e.g., Breathless (1983), Internal Affairs (1990), etc.) and I can get involved in his contrary nature.  In other words, he won't bore me with a one-dimensional persona.  Here however he is thoughtful, kind, considerate, intelligent--a non-sleazy, gray-suited business man with a wise and fatherly manner.  Perhaps this is Gere's persona for his middle years...<br />In the case of Julia Roberts, not only is she nice to look at, she is interesting to look at.  It is no accident that her face is one of the silver screen's dominate images from the nineties.  She has a powerfully expression nature and can assume a role as easily as one puts on a coat.  She is striking physically, the huge mouth, the delicate nose, the long limbs...  She is also the quintessence of a woman who can appear ordinary or beautiful according to circumstances.  I have seen her in two PBS productions of Nature.  (Yes, she is a Hollywood star with compassion, or at least one who loves animals.)  In one she is in Borneo with orangutans, and in the other in Mongolia with the descendants of Genghis Khan and the wild horses.  In both cases she throws herself into the dirt and discomfort like a trooper without a hint of the glamour she left thousands of miles behind.  She charms both the children of the nomads and the orangutans.  In fact, one randy orangutan becomes so smitten with her that he starts to put the moves on, and has to be restrained!  In other words she has an equalitarian, democratic, down-to-earth nature which sits well with a popular audience.  She has made so many movies lately (hurriedly as her youth is expiring: she is now over thirty, the age of death for most Hollywood actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.<br />Will her role in Pretty Woman help?  Although I found it difficult to swallow her fake bad grammar, the phony lack of sophistication, and the predictability of her golden heart, I thought it marginally plausible that such a striking woman COULD in some strange parallel universe be reduced to hooking in Hollywood.  And I thought she did a creditable job by bringing some originality to a well-worn role.  Certainly I believed in Julia Roberts, the whore, as much as I did in Elisabeth Shue, the whore (from Leaving Las Vegas (1995)).  Had Roberts been portrayed as a drug addict--which of course Hollywood made a stringent point of NOT doing, since they needed Middle America to identify with her in order to sell tickets--I might have bought it.  Most American prostitutes are drug addicts.  That's how most of them they got enslaved into the business in the first place.<br />So what we have here is a variation on an old Hollywood fantasy: poor, underclass girl, through her natural beauty, lovable nature and good common sense wins the heart of a man of considerable means, thus upgrading her social and economic status, etc.  In others words, this is a woman's fantasy-fulfillment movie all the way.  The real question to be asked, though, is how did the chemistry between the two stars work?  Do Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn or Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have anything to be jealous about?  I think not, but judging from the box office success and the fact that they were paired again in Runaway Bride (1999), I am probably wrong.  But see it and judge for yourself.  Despite the clich&eacute; situation, this is more than a confectioner's diversion because of what it implies, and what we can learn, about the American psyche, circa 1990.d actresses) that I cannot keep up with them, so many that her ranking among the great stars of the screen is still up for grabs as we evaluate her many performances.<br />Will her role in Pretty Woman help?

0684853523|5.0|I just finished reading &quot;On Writing&quot; which I have to admit is the first book of Stephen's King's work that I have ever read.  I prefer to watch some of his movies, I loved &quot;The Green Mile&quot;.  I have purchased nine other books on the subject of writing that have been written by various authors, some I thought good, some just so-so.  I loved Dorothea Brande's book, &quot;Becoming a Writer&quot;.  But King told it exactly as I see it.  I think that is why I loved the book so much.  When you write, be yourself.  Get hidden away and get the tools that work for you.  The man has one outstanding MUSE in his corner, and his talent with words is unlimited.  I hail him as the &quot;King&quot; and the man that touched me with his book &quot;On Writing&quot;, especially the chapter on his accident.  I recommend it to everyone.
B0000069KS|5.0|This is just the silliest thing I have seen in a good while!  Of COURSE, the music is wonderful; this is only to be expected.  The plot is highly contrived and completely implausible, and this is a GOOD thing!  This is not a failed attempt at a &quot;good&quot; story; this is ridiculousness in its purest form.  The story is basically as follows: Ringo receives an extremely large and garish ring in a fan letter from an &quot;Eastern bird,&quot; causing a variety of people to chase him around trying to kill him and/or paint him red.  My favorite line, spoken by George: &quot;Hey, it's a thingy!  A fiendish thingy!&quot;  Also, no one should miss the sight of a tiny Paul clad in a gum wrapper, cowering in an ashtray.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I think Toy Story 2 is better than the 1st. The animation is even more realistic and lively. It's the story though, that truly astounded me. It is sentimental and funny.I think everyone has had a favorite toy and as we come of age, we lose interest in it. While I certainly don't believe toys have feelings, the story can be transcended into reality. The toys can be symbolic of a best friend from childhood, and with the way the world is today, it is easy to grow apart as we grow up. Someday we may go back to find that friend and become tied to them again, and sometimes we just have to let them go and know that they will be best friends with someone else. I believe that this is the true heart of this movie.While this is certainly a great movie for kids, adults like me, will certainly find the humor and entertainment value in it as well.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Limp Bizkit has sold out. this cd lacks the originality of there first cd &quot;three dollar bill,&quot; which i liked. This new cd sounds identical to their last cd &quot;significant other&quot;  and i'm sorry but there must be a line drawn when Fred bashes TRENT REZNOR AND HIS LYRICS, that's uncalled for. this cd simply sucks because Fred sounds like a wienning idiot.
B000002LEE|5.0|The Amazon reviewer says that the songs on this album aren't as good as those on &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual,&quot; but that this album is &quot;much more consistent.&quot; What is that supposed to mean? This album DEFINED Janes Addiction and set them apart from the world of hair-band slop during the late Eighties. It's &quot;much more consistent&quot; than &quot;Ritual&quot; because it's much BETTER than &quot;Ritual.&quot; &quot;Nothing's Shocking&quot; showed us that bands don't have to follow formulas to be successful. This album defied categorization at the time. Is it metal, like Metallica? Is it alternative, like The Smiths? Is it funk-based like Red Hot Chili Peppers? The answers are, YES, YES, and YES. With Eric Avery's pounding bass-rhythms and Stephen Perkins' virtuoso percussions providing the true foundation of the music, Dave Navarro's trippy/Zep-esque guitars were free to weave a tapestry of sound that was complimented by an unconventional singer/screamer in Perry Farrell. Metalheads could appreciate songs like &quot;Had A Dad,&quot; &quot;Mountain Song,&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Zen&quot; while the alternative crowd got into the more psychedelic and funk-based songs like &quot;Summertime Rolls&quot; and &quot;Idiots Rule.&quot; This is the definitive Janes Addiction album. &quot;Ritual&quot; was more pop-heavy and erratic, wheras this album is dark, often funny, daring, emotional, and much more involved with the human spirit than &quot;Ritual.&quot; It really is the perfect encapsulation of the power of Janes Addiction, and it should not be overlooked in favor of their more radio-friendly, but thematically inferior second studio album, &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual.&quot;
B000007MVL|5.0|I cant beleive people would state this as dissapointing, or one of Kates worst albums,This is a simply astonishing album, one of Kate's best. Songs like `wow', `In search of Peter pan', `Don't push your foot on the heartbrake' and `hammer horror' show how original and exciting Kate's music is. Although it was made in the time of 2 months you certainly wouldn't know it and in fact it makes the album even more astonishing! In parts the songs are reminiscent of both `kick inside' and `never for ever', but songs like `Symphony in blue' are slightly different to Kate's other work but still hauntingly beautiful. Like all of Kate's albums you need an open mind and a good imagination, listen to it 5 or 6 times and you'll fall in love, and realise what a work of genius it is!! Forget Britney Spears, this is worth your hard earned money! It'll make you feel glad to be alive!

B00004XONN|5.0|I'm enjoying the reviews of &quot;Kid A,&quot; but I don't think they really explain the album too well.  Of course, it's hard to know if I can explain it any better, but I thought I'd give it a shot.  First of all, I read that &quot;Kid A&quot; is number one on the Billboard charts, so it's pretty much guaranteed to be talked about for years to come, positively or otherwise, just because no one would ever think that an album like this would sell *that* well.  At first, my thoughts varied a great deal depending on the tracks.  My initial reaction to &quot;Everything In it's Right Place,&quot; the opener, was to skip it about ten seconds into the song; I couldn't stand it.  Now, a couple of weeks later, (I bought the album the day it came out) it's one of my favorites, depending on my mood.  Everyone is talking about how &quot;Optimistic&quot; is fantastic, including many who hate the album, and again, I didn't like it at all for about a week or so.  This experience sorta sums up &quot;Kid A&quot;; you may hate it at first, but if you listen a couple more times knowing what to expect, you'll probably find yourself enjoying a few tracks, and when you listen for those tracks, again, you'll find yourself like a few more tracks.  The ones I liked right from the beginning were: &quot;Kid A,&quot; &quot;How to Disappear Completely,&quot; and &quot;Idioteque,&quot; but you'll notice how the ones that people like vary a good deal from review to review.  This, in my mind, is the strongest sign that this is a good album; when you only see a specific songs mentioned in a review, you know that those were the ones that the band put a real effort into.  And despite what the reviews say, this isn't a complete departure for Radiohead; just like you could, in retrospect, hear &quot;OK Computer&quot; coming on &quot;The Bends,&quot; you can hear &quot;Kid A&quot; coming on &quot;OK Computer.&quot;  The major difference is (apart from an increase on ambient noise, and a decrease on guitars) that the lingering sadness of the last tracks on the latter album take center stage here, which adds to the album's intimidating nature.  So, does this mean you'll like the album?  No.  I imagine that there are those who, having listened to &quot;Kid A&quot; a few times, will find it more annoying than bewildering.  It's perfectly understandable, and for this reason, I recommend that you borrow it from a friend for a little while, and listen a few times.  If you don't like it, just return it to them, no harm done.  Of course, if you do like it, this album will more than likely become a small obsession.
B00004W3MS|4.0|Delicate walls of guitar feedback and rich basslines await the patient listener, but you'll also have to negotiate a disconsolate falsetto and Icelandic lyrics that are pushed up in the mix on this album.  Musically, it bears strong resemblance to The Verve circa &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot; with the added intimacy of a string section that invokes the quaintest of moods.  Sigur Rs tread a fine line between pastoral melodrama and ornate spaciousness, but when they get it right this album sounds nothing short of majestic.
B0000033K2|5.0|I have the other 2 box sets of Coltrane's recorded works - the 16-CD Prestige set and the 8-CD Impulse set.  This is by far the most impressive, definitive, and even of the sets.  <br />John finds himself on here - he cuts his seminal &quot;Giant Steps&quot; material on Discs 1 and 2, then moves on to form his original quartet (with Elvin, McCoy, and Steve Davis) and cut a wealth of blues-inspired material while the band was fresh.  He discovers the soprano sax and plays some startling figures on it (the best-known being &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;).  The compositions on here are perfect and the playing pretty great.  John never sounded better, and I can't imagine anyone with an interest in jazz not enjoying the heck out of this set.
B000003AEB|5.0|Although Doggystyle is nearing eight years of age, it's still one of may favorite CDs and remains in constant rotation in my poor, overused CD player.<br />How can one not resist the raw rhymes? How can one not move to the smooth flow?<br />If Gangsta Rap was invented by Dr. Dre and N.W.A., it was refined by Snoop Doggy Dogg with Doggystyle, an asset to the Rap music genre.
B000000LZV|4.0|There was a time that I was especially impressed by this, but after going back and listening to earlier efforts like &quot;Buzz or Howl&quot; and &quot;The Punch Line&quot;, I came to see this as a bit slowed-down and even watered-down from what the band was capable of.  Still - there's a lot of great music here.  If you don't like one track, hold on for a minute and another will be coming down the line.<br />The band's instrumental interplay is sensational.  A lot of the energy comes from George Hurley's wild, accomplished drumming.  On top of that, Mike Watt is playing some of the finest rock bass committed to vinyl or disc.  And on top of that, D. Boon was radiating energy and commitment on his guitar and with his voice.<br />Even though I'm getting a bit old for music this aggressive, I have to agree with other posters when they claim the Minutemen as one of the most important, or perhaps the most important, bands of the 80's.  In the context of the right-wing mania that swept America, they really had something to say and they said it with a great deal of panache.<br />Am I crazy, or am I hearing &quot;Corona&quot; in an automobile commercial these days?  You live for awhile, you see things that you never thought you'd see.

0944379044|5.0|Rating this book is something of a futile exercise.  What is important is that the reader understand that this book is a penetrating look into the psycho/socio state of a man who held tremendous influence on the 20th century world.  From a historical perspective one can see clearly that Hitler did in fact spell out his goals for a Thousand Year Reich and wonder why Chamberlain and others so greivously overlooked it.  As despicable as he and his literary work may be, it must be used as a tool in the study of one of the most tyrannical regimes in the twentieth century, lest such mistakes be misunderstood and hence repeated.

6304457383|5.0|In her last Oscar nominated role, Audrey Hepburn brings her role as Susie Hendrix to life in this thrilling film brought together by Hitchcock influence. <br />Susie is learning to adapt to her blindness, which resulted from a recent auto accident, she recieves help from Gloria, a girl who lives in the upstairs appartment &amp; her loving photographer husband, Sam. Sam who does a great deal of traveling in his line of business, excepts a doll as a favor to a young woman, on his way home from Canada. He takes it home deciding to give it to a child in the hospital only to have it dissapear. <br />But what Sam &amp; Susie don't know is that the doll is actually filled with small packets of herion &amp; that a murderous drug dealer (Alan Arkin) will stop at nothing to get his hands on the doll. He inlists two con-men (Richard Crenna &amp; Jack Weston) to help him trick Susie into handing the doll over while posing as policemen &amp; Sam's friends. The plot thickins as Susie begins to realize the truth behind the criminals &amp; turns her weakness into a powerful strength. <br />Many claim that the movie is a pathetic excuse for a horror &amp; that the movie isn't at all scary but I guess they consider films like Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream, &amp; Halloween scary because of the cheap scares &amp; gore. But if your not hooked on the slasher genre you should watch this classic, &amp; try watching it in the dark, if you don't scare easy.
B00004Y7SF|4.0|There's no doubting the fact that Christina Aguilera has one of the most amazing voices anyone has ever heard.  HOWEVER she does show off a little too much on this album.  There are many unnecessary trills she adds in every now and then...well more like very often, and sometimes it just doesn't fit.  Don't get me wrong, she sounds AMAZING, but showing off too much isn't a good thing.  Overall, though, the CD is great.  My favorite track is &quot;The Christmas Song&quot;.  All the trills in there are amazing!  I only wish she had put more original songs in there instead of doing so many classics, but that's just my opinion.  If you're thinking of buying this album, do it!  She has a great voice and the songs sound great.  Even the classics are slightly different in the way she sings them.  This CD is a must-have for any Christina fan!!  Enjoy!
0684853523|4.0|In On Writing, Stephen King shares with us the motivations and mechanics behind the man who has become perhaps the greatest storyteller of our time. I gained some excellent insights into King, how he crafts his fiction, and why he writes horror novels.<br />The jacket copy calls the structure of the book &quot;brilliant,&quot; but I found it a weakness. King states early on that On Writing is not an autobiography, but a large part of it is. King has written a memoir, but just doesn't know it. For almost half the book he tells us about his New England childhood, his mother's terrible illness, and meeting his wife, Tabitha, and he ends the book with an excellent piece on being run over by Bryan Smith and how writing became a good part of his therapy.<br />I love all that stuff -- it's the best stuff in the book, and it's far more telling of King's development as a writer than the straightforward writing instruction (which you can find in most other books on writing) -- mechanics, grammar, writing a good cover letter, getting an agent.<br />His chapters on writing are less useful, I think, but are still interesting reading. King spins twenty pages or so about getting Carrie published. I could have read an entire book about the publishing history of each of his forty-odd titles.<br />You get three books in one with On Writing, folks, and each one's damned good. I was sad when it all ended.
6302878527|5.0|Mark and Joanna Wallace meet while each is sailing to France, meet again while traveling, travel together, fall in love, and marry.  Then the real work begins, with quarrels, unfaithfulness, a husband who loves his wife and daughter but frequently seems to love his work more, an obviously loving but equally stubborn wife, and, most important, love that brings them back together.<br />Audrey Hepburn is elegant, playful, passionate, willful, and loving in turn, while Albert Finney is excellent in his role as a man in love with his profession of architecture - sometimes so much that he doesn't pay sufficient attention to things right under his nose.  William Daniel and Eleanor Bron are exceptional in their portrayal of Mark's girlfriend from his college days in America (I think that Eleanor Bron is English, but her northeastern American accent is perfect) and her husband, touring the European continent with Mark and Joanna after their marriage but before the birth of their<br />daughter.  You also get a few minutes of a very young and, of course, very beautiful and sexy Jacqueline Bisset flirting with Albert Finney fairly early in the movie.
0679879269|5.0|As a teacher of English and as an adult, I loved this book.  I enjoyed how Pullman strove to go beyond typical fantasy plotting (a' la The Wheel of Time series) and create a new Paradise Lost.  However, the first two novels only barely hint at the theological implicatiobs that Pullman brings to the forefront in The Amber Spyglass.  Pullman has made this series practically unusable in a public school setting.  I have, without hesitiation, given The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife to my students.  But the dismissive attitude towards organized religion wil give me pause before I give it to any of my seventh graders (although I tend to agree with his themes), and I certainly can't use it for entire classes. As an artist, Pullman obviously has the right to go in any direction he wants to; I was just somewhat startled by the intense theological tone set In Book III.
B00003CWTH|5.0|I have seen too few films with this much hidden intensity and strength. In a subtle, seamless way, all things come together, follow each other, resolve themselves, and even the things that die come to terms with what is around them. This is an immensely thought provoking film that will last, passively perhaps, in your mind for a long while. Don't miss it, and you shall be rewarded.
0446525537|5.0|I highly recommend this book to high school students and others who are neophytes in living and literature.   Sparks doesn't use any big words, and he doesn't create any situations that show how complicated life can be. There are no moral complexities, no meaningful ambiguities that might confuse the novice who has not experienced the tensions that arise in human relationships. Nothing to threaten, nothing to evoke insight. Everything is satisfyingly predictable, and the end is visible from the beginning pages.<br />There'll be no stretch marks after you finish &quot;A Walk to Remember.&quot;
B00003CXFG|5.0|If you like science fiction and/or action (like me), this is a great movie. The movie has great special effects and lots of action from the beginning to the end. The DTS sound is top notch.
0062502182|5.0|I like the Alcmemist book because it, taught me that we could do everything that we want. In our lives we have to make decisions when we want something. We need to make the imposible to realize the things that we really want
B00003CWRX|4.0|There are few directors whose work I enjoy as much, and can identify as easily, as Michael Mann's. He's a master at making the ordinary into something dramatic and seductive. And he really does know how to make the most of a soundtrack. This human docudrama follows the emotional destruction of a man caught between his conscience and a corporation trying to silence him, and of the journalists who drew him out and then are pressured to abandon him. (I will make the comment that I find it ironic that a movie about journalists wiggling away from the truth, has itself altered the real story.) Russell Crowe did an excellent job as the beleaguered tobacco executive, as did Al Pacino as an assertive television producer. Actually, all the performances are great. Bruce McGill enlivens one scene considerably in his role as a Mississippi lawyer. It maintains an edgy pace though-out its length, which is best described as really, really, long. Eventually I felt the way I do when I've spent too long in an art gallery. I became jaded, and began to wish that something else - anything - would happen to change the pace. Still, the length does allows us time to get to know the characters, and after all, it is a Michael Mann film, and that's all that matters.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Pearl Jam doesn't sell out, while Metallica will continue to go pop (and do whatever they can to get your money), Pearl Jam continues to create rock and roll history with songwritting and musical composition we haven't heard since Led Zepplin.<br />I think Yield was the bands &quot;come back&quot; album that was a lot more mellow in tone overall (WishList, MFC, Given to Fly).<br />Binaural is an excellent album, it has a good mix of songs, and the lryics make statements, lryically this is a deep as the band has gone (Vitalogy and Ten also come to mind when I think from the sole lryics). <br />The CD may not sell like Ten or Vs, but who cares? Pearl Jam doesn't seem to, why sell out and change to fit pop culture? screw that, This collection of songs helps balance out the live shows (which consist of up to 30+ songs per set), all the songs on the CD sound much better live (something happend in the mix)
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This CD Rocks. It has some great music on it. It is not just slow christmas stuff it has some really good R&amp;B christmas stuff on it. This is a must have. Good Job Christina on another awesome CD.
B00002MZ2T|2.0|I spend around two hours a day in the gym, and they have looped this CD on the sound system day in and day out for two weeks.  I must admit the album has its moments (some of the ballads are kind of touching), but I find it's also chock full of super-cheezy cliches and silly lines (primarily found in the &quot;Animal Song&quot;). Many of the songs are in the same key and use the same chordal structures (almost a'la Britney Spears). Also, the lead singer uses an irritating switch to falsetto, which gets old real fast. These little annoyances are making me want to start working out with earplugs in. Two stars for effort.
B00003CXDG|5.0|OK, Ok, if you've read the reviews (both professional and customer), you've probably heard all the negatives...bad plot, cliches, predictability, etc. etc.  And perhaps all of that is true; for example, who could buy a love story that starts out with the hero and heroine making googy-eyes at each other while one of them is dangling periously over the edge of a cliff?  But, it seems to me that the whole point of a good action flick is the ACTION, isn't it?  I mean, if you want to see great plot, multi-dimensional characters and the like, I direct you to the various films in the Merchant Ivory genre.  If you like good action, stylish film-making, and overall bang for your buck, MI:2 is the way to go.<br />  What MI:2 may lack in the complexity of its plot or character development, it more than makes up for it with the complexity of many of its action scenes.  This corroborates the rumor that the screenplay was written around the action &quot;set pices&quot; already composed by Cruise and Woo. (And really, shouldn't a good action movie revolve around the actual action scenes?)    From the opening of the movie, the famous rock-climbing stunt, you can tell that the action pieces in this movie will be something different.  And from the panoramic and breathtaking rock-climbing scene to the  motorcycle-chase, cum shoot-out, cum hand-to-hand combat finale, you can't help but be riveted by John Woo's unltra-macho, ultra-stylistic direction.  Even a scene involving flamenco dancers is turned into macho eye-candy by Woo's deft film artistry.<br />  And sure, Woo often riverts to the same formula: slow-mo shots, standoffs where all the characters seem to be pointing about a million guns at each other, a strange fetish for doves and pigeons....  But, darn it, all these things look good!<br />  Another, quite refreshing, positive in this movie is that the female character, played by Thandie Newton, is not a simple foil character, made to be used sexually and then killed off to make way for another potential conquest.  Instead, she actually makes a unilateral, powerful decision at the movie's climax that affects the entire outcome of the movie.  Show me a Bond pic where that happens!<br />  All in all, despite its flaws with plot and character, MI:2 delivers the best of all cinematic guilty pleasures: a good couple of hours on the edge of your seat, and some virtuoso, fun-to-watch film-making.  This movie should make any fan of action pics very happy.
0684853523|5.0|Although my interest in writing lies with children's books, I LOVED this book.  I was able to draw so much inspiration and good advice from a wonderfully entertaining read.  (For those of you who've read it, sorry about the adverb).  I was impressed with King's honesty in discussing his past, his problems, and his immeasurable talent.<br />If you love Stephen King's writing, if you love to write, or if you love quick and informative entertaining reads, you'll love this book.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's first major debut, Hybrid Theory, is incredible. I have been waiting for this CD ever since I first heard their demo many months ago and it has left nothing to be desired. Beginning with the intense beats of the track &quot;Papercut&quot; and ending with the raw and agressive track &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot;, Linkin Park covers many levels of today's contemporary rock. Whether your looking for rapping, singer, or yelling (which more of a stressing of words rather than yelling which IMHO is awesome), you'll find it all on this CD. On another positive note; they lyrics do not contain excessive, pointless amounts of child-inappropriate language and lyrics and they do not use them to sell records like bands like Limp Bizkit and rappers like Eminem. So inconclusion, LINKIN PARK easily out-does Limp Bizkit's new, dissapointing album, CSFAHFW, and is truely a band to keep an eye on. Other bands with similar sounds include: Nonpoint, (Hed) P.E., Primer 55, Papa Roach, Ultraspank, Spineshank, Endo, Mudvayne, Slaves on Dope, Downset, and Crazy Town.
B00003CXDG|5.0|this film is the bomb ! Tom Cruise is the man ! Thandie Newton is the woman and the rest are.... there. This film is stylish and John Woo has made the perfect action ... romance movie. I want to star in MI 3 so tom, if you're reading, email me please. The soundtrack rocks , especially Limp Bizkit. ROCK ON !
6305949638|5.0|I really enjoyed this film; Tobey Maguire is one of my favorite actors and he doesn't disappoint here.  I felt real bad tho when Erik Sullivan (Fuzzy) died.  He was so cute---you just wanted to pick him up and give him a big hug !!
B00003CXHJ|1.0|U-571 is nothing more than Das Boot with a higher budget, no realism whatsoever, not historically accurate, and recycled from over 50 submarine movies. I didn't care for it at all. If you want a real sub movie, don't waste money on this. The only thing this movie has going for it is that the action is great. The special effects are definitely better than The Hunt for Red October's (not that I'm disrespecting Hunt in any way, but its special effects did leave a bit to be desired). The sound is great, and the tension is also well done. But, when you look past the action movie coating, this movie is nothing but Armageddon in a sub. The movie throws away the chance to be good only to be a pumped up action film. While U-571 is not about something that never happened, it is instead much worse. It was the British, not the Americans, who found the Enigma machine. This is just another example of those stupid American producers over at Universal who make the rest of us look bad. This movie takes a great accomplishment away from Britain. I also can't figure out why Harvey Keitel is in this movie. He is a bad actor; this movie doesn't deserve him. I guess he was low on cash, and the script could have looked good on paper. Basically, if you want an entertaining yet stupid sub movie, rent this. If you want a real sub movie that is well made and accurate, not to mention entertaining, rent Das Boot or Crimson Tide. Otherwise, you might find this piece of dishonorable trash appealing.
B000002U9E|5.0|Simply brilliant. I never tire of its majesty. Yes, I said. Yes! Delicate weaving gives continual pleasure as on the 13th listen you discover a previously unfound connection. Practically hypertextual. Gothic, perverse, erotic, excessive. Yes, I said again. Dreamy. Lost. Underappreciated by so called 'Alternatives.' Essential. Thank you, Kate.
0452277752|4.0|So, since it's not possible at the moment to find every single Bachman-book I have to rate them here in this compilation. I won't ask why they left the fifth one away. But, why?<br />If you know Stephen King you know it's not the same as Richard Bachman. It's the same person, but not the same author. The style is different, the themes, everything. It's not better or worst, it's just different.<br />'The Long Walk': One of the typical things of Bachman books is their strong pessimistic view of the world. This is one of the most pessimistic books I've ever read, but it's very effective and disturbing. Not an easy one.<br />'Rage': Maybe one of the simplest premises ever, but wonderful solved. It's very realistic and was written long before Littletown or something like that. It's a good one, not very easy too and quite disturbing, but better than 'The Long Walk'.<br />'Roadwork': Surely the most psychological one. It's very good I think, maybe the best of this collection. No ray of light is seen here again, but it's good anyhow.<br />'Running Man': Has nothing to do with the stupid movie. It's another wonderful idea, very similar to 'The Long Walk', but different somehow. A negative ending again and a pessimistic and depressive one.<br />These books are not easy to read and they are NO horror books!
B00004X01U|1.0|In reading through some of these reviews, it is calling Music the best thing since sliced bread.  I can't disagree with this more.  Madonna has already written the best CD of her career - and that was the last one, Ray of Light.  Usually, the followup to a mega album such as that is either horrible, or is just &quot;eh&quot;.  This one is in the horrible stage.  I tried to like it, I really did.  I can't.  The only tune on here that is really listenable is the title track.  I hated Madonna's early bubble gum music, and generally liked her stuff from the Greatest Hits era till now, but this?  Blech.  Borderline is better than anything on this new album, and I really dislike her tunes like Borderline.<br />Some folks will blindly like this thing because &quot;Oh god, it's new songs&quot;, but listen with your own mind.  This is so far inferior to Ray of Light, it's obscene how much better ROL is.
0684853523|5.0|If you'd like to know what makes this guy tick...take a look.  This is a quick read filled with an assortment of information.  From early childhood memories, amusing anecdotes, and tips on writing your own stories, to WHERE ideas for his stories came from (which is what I'VE always wanted to know)...it's all here.<br />Don't judge Mr. King as a person or a writer without having read this, his latest work.
B000002PC6|5.0|&quot;Physical&quot; is a solid state of the art pop album that found Newton-John at the pinnacle of her commerical stride.  The collection contains an even mix of ballads and uptempto songs that appeal to the masses (it sold over 2 million copies.)  The title track muscled it's way to #1 and with incredible stamina remained there an outstanding 10 weeks.  It remains one of the most popular pop tunes of all time and the top single of the 1980's! <br />Produced by John Farrar (who wrote the majority of Livvy's hits), this collection opens with the pulsating beats of the electric track &quot;Landslide,&quot; glides into &quot;Stranger's Touch&quot; which highlights Olivia's beguiling vocals.  &quot;Make A Move On Me&quot; is a formulac, tongue in cheek, upbeat dance number that also ignited the pop charts(#5).  This is followed by a ballad done in the classic Newton-John vein, &quot;Falling.&quot;  This segues beautifully into the upbeat and inspirational &quot;Love Make Me Strong,&quot; in which the singer elicits a confident and self assured delivery.  The title track simply rocks, with attitude! &quot;Silvery Rain&quot; serves as an environmental plea in which Olivia addresses the issues of pollution.  It's a uptempto number with a message.  &quot;Carried Away&quot; contains some lovely harmonies inspired by its writer, Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees.  &quot;Recovery&quot; is the consummate breakup song.  The album quietly concludes with Olivia's self-penned, heartfelt composition, &quot;The Promise {The Dolphin Song},&quot; <br />The album is accompanied with a full length collection of music videos that cover the entire album and includes several bonus tracks: (&quot;A Little More Love,&quot; &quot;Magic,&quot; &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You&quot;).  Olivia was the first recipient of a Grammy award for Best Video Performance in 1981.  Filled with colorful sets and elaborate costumes, the video is the ultimate visual companion to the album.
0811826848|5.0|I do a Beatles show 5 days a week and have lots of books tohelp in my show, but none as comprehensive as this.  This book isstraight out of the mouths of the boys themselves.  It's honest, it'seducational and it's downright fun.  The photos are fantastic and manypreviously unpublished.  I would recommend this book to any seriousBeatles fan.  It's going to help my show no end!
B00004X01U|1.0|I loved Ray of Light, but this CD is terrible in comparison.  Many of the lyrics sound like something a 4th grader would write and the electronic voice stuff gets old fast.  I guess my first clue should have been the cowgirl outfit on the front cover.  This just isn't the Madonna we all know and have come to love to see what she does next.  This album seems like it is more of a novice artist's than Madonna's.  It's like she is going through a musical middle age crisis and has lost herself somewhere along the way.
B000009EAD|4.0|SOMETHING WICKED is Iced Earth's most diverse and best-sounding album yet.  The melodies are well-developed, the vocal harmonies are excellent, the songwriting is mature, and the rhythms are as heavy as ever.  Unlike the previous few albums, this one features songs that are designed to hold their own weight rather than support a concept.  Thus, I'd say THE DARK SAGA is probably better start to finish, but this is the album to own if you're looking for some great tracks.  Honestly, I don't know how fans of this style won't be able to find something interesting here.  There are power ballads, an instrumental, speed metal tunes, and even a mini concept album to close.  Truly a diverse offering.<br />If the negative comments about IE are keeping you from buying an album of theirs, hopefully I can convince you.  They're not incredibly original, they're not musicians along the lines of Dream Theater (but they're still quite good), nor is their music particularly complex.  But this band has as much passion for metal as any I've heard, and in my book, that outweighs everything else combined.  Jon Schaffer (guitarist and songwriter) has made this band what it is because of his love for true metal and his refusal to compromise his integrity.  If that doesn't convince you, consider the fact that their live album (ALIVE IN ATHENS) has sold over 500,000 copies in Greece.  Since there are about 10 million people in Greece, that would translate to about 14 million copies sold in the U.S. Obviously, this band is doing something right.
B00003CXA6|5.0|Finally on DVD! It's about time.<br />I cannot watch this movie with other people in the room because it is so powerful. A definite 1-box-of-kleenex film, it's even more tragic because it is mostly true with some &quot;artistic license&quot; taken. The parts of the actual battle that are portrayed here are accurate as well as true to the book (Killer Angels). Remember though- it is not a portrayal of the battle as a whole- merely select portions and patricipants.<br />Tom Berenger firmly cemented my view that Longstreet is one of the most interesting and complex generals in the war, and Jeff Daniels portrays Chamberlain with a thoughtful and learned air that makes you forget he's also capable of such broad humor as &quot;Dumb and Dumber.&quot; Martin Sheen as Lee is good, but he is overshadowed by other actors.<br />The soundtrack is a work of art unto itself, and I highly recommend the boxed set with the booklet.<br />I guarantee you'll never look at the Civil War in the same light after you watch this film.
B000007T1M|5.0|When I first purchased this album I did not like it to much.  I started listening to it more and more and it grew on me.  I found that it made me feel good and full of energy.  Songs that I really liked on this album are: &quot;War&quot;, &quot;P.L.U.C.K.&quot;,&quot;soil&quot; and &quot;Darts&quot;.  The songs were well written and thought out,most of them are very political and send out a message of intolerance.  Overall I would recommend this album to anyone who likes political laced lyrics and hard driven guitar riffs.
B00000JZC4|5.0|One day I switched on the tv and saw four guys screaming inside a glimmering cube in the middle of the desert, I was hooked instantly. Filter puts a new twist on rock music, his unique voice helps excentuate the hard rythem of the music. With songs like I'm Not The Only One, Welcome To The Fold, Cancer, Skinny, Miss Blue and Captian Bligh it is hard to match up to this cd musically, 1999 was a fantastic year for music. I would definitly put this in my top five of the year.
0966638328|5.0|I love this new book. As a graphic artist, color selection has been a weak area for me - I know when I finally get the right picks, but often the process takes me too long.  This guide is a great time saver, with lots of color combinations to choose from, nicely catogorized by moods or feelings that they can provoke.     It is also a very good educational tool on the basics of color for new students or for a refresher for anyone.  The book is beautifuly laid out with wonderful color pictures.    An added benifit for graphic production is the handy table in the back of the book that converts Pantone colors into 4 and 6 color process percentages.    A Great Buy!
0553573403|5.0|I think this is a great book and series.  It is well worth the investment of time and money.  The characters were very realistic.  It does get a little dark and graphic but only to the point of setting the tone of what the characters are going through.  This book is not for those who are squeamish and those who always like those &quot;happily ever after&quot; outcomes.
B00000DGSN|5.0|This is a live album with a very big reputation, but it lives up to it. Undoubtedly the best of Deep Purple's countless live albums, Made In Japan is truly great. The songs are long and jamming, with some particularly awesome duel solos between guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and organist Jon Lord. If you thought \\"Smoke on the Water\\" couldn't get any better, you were wrong. This version is loads better, with some really sharp guitar, including an excellent solo and a cool drawn-out ending. \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" is another great improv-jam and another Blackmore showcase. However, the longest song, the near-twenty minute \\"Space Truckin',\\" showcases Lord's considerable improv talents. This is one of the finest live albums ever.
B00004XOWM|2.0|This is definately NOT one of their best works. The weakest of the 3 albums, I would only recommend getting this for all the hardcore Limp fans out there. True disappointment :&lt;
0441003257|5.0|but not enough can be said about this devourable book! <br />It's fabulous. That's the line at the bottom. :) It's impossible to read it only once. I borrowed the copy I have from a friend, who told me many jokes ahead of time (and I still found them funny when I read them, and when I reread them!), and is in fact the only reason I even knew about it! For an entire weekend, everything we did was &quot;sauntering vaugly downwards.&quot; Anyway, the copy I have is borrowed, and I do have some intention of returning it to her...<br />Some of the footnotes are go on for longer than they really should, but only because of one of them do I finally understand the brittish currancy system!<br />The Them are great counterparts to the Four Bikers, who in turn have other counterparts: the OTHER Four Bikers of the Apocalypse!<br />If you want to veiw an angel and a demon drunk together, I don't know of a better place than here this book.<br />I love just going back through the books and looking at the jokes: my copy has a bunch of sticky notes in it, marking my favorite parts. There is a LOT of them.<br />I think it was the San Diego Tribune who put it best: &quot;A steamroller of silliness that made me giggle out lout.&quot;<br />Anyway, now I feel I've said enough. Read this book!<br />Have a nice doomsday.
B00003CX6P|1.0|One of the worst movies- EVER.  The first 30-60 minutes is decent, but from there on out, it just plain stunk.  The plot if pretty much predicable and towards the end it's as implausible as the end of The Rocky Horror Picture Show.  My suggestion is to leave after the first hour.  If not, you're in for a long, boring rest of the movie, which you could take a nap during and not miss much.
0140434151|4.0|An intellectually stimulating piece of literature, which challenges one's beliefs and enlightens one's mind with inventive theories concerning life-- if this is the type of commentary that peaks your fancy than I would not recommend reading Jane Austen's Emma.  Indeed, the book is a coming-of-age story illustrating the comical mishaps of Emma Woodhouse, the novel's heroine, who takes destiny into her own hands.  Particularly, she makes it her purpose to find suitable mates for her close acquaintances.  As one might imagine, at times this creates a slightly awkward situation for the parties involved.  Therefore, readers are introduced to a strong set of supporting characters inhabiting the small commonwealth of Highbury.<br />Undoubtedly there is one amongst the bunch that the reader is able to identify with.  For instance, Mr. Woodhouse, the town hypochondriac, who fears any situation which could spark the onset of illness; therefore, he virtually never leaves the comfortable confines of his home.  In addition, Miss Bates and Mrs. Elton, the village gossips, who make it their business to learn all the comings and goings of the townsfolk.  Besides the previously mentioned characters, there are a host of others who take you into their hearts and homes within the pages of the Jane Austen's novel.  <br />In fact her strong characterizations were perhaps the most compelling factors that kept me turning the pages.  Indeed, Emma lacks the complex nature of many other novels written today.  It is, however, a timeless example of the dynamics of human interaction.  Yet the book's strongest claim to attract readers is a carefree amusement ending with a happily ever after.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I can't almost tell how much I am looking forward to the release of this magnificient piece! The film was in French theatres on 20th june and I won't tell how many times I've seen it, you don't want to know... Even if special FX are a bit too smooth, just get into the movie, and it's Rome finally come true. A genuine epic of all times and despite long exposure scenes, a breath catching sort. If you don't know, yet,Russell Crowe and don't remember how fabulous were Richard Harris and late Oliver Reed, it's definitly the film to start with for next Xmas.

There is no need to look further than this book and the practices within it.  Salvation is here, salvation is NOW.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen in the year 2000!  The griping story of the hero Maximos kept me on the edge of my seat through the entire show!  I highly suggest this movie to everyone!!!
0684853523|5.0|And I didn't really read the book because I thought I had writing mystically spelled out in my future.  I read it because (and this may sound silly) as a constant reader, I have always enjoyed his introductions and afterwords.  Reading them makes me feel like I am able to understand the how and why of that particular novel.<br />This book is exactly like a conversation with an amazing writer that I've always wanted to have.<br />Wonderful - even if you don't think you have what it takes to become a serious novelist, King makes you feel like....you just might.
B0000028PI|5.0|The Last Temptation just may be the most underrated album of Alice Cooper's long and successful career. The album gets away from the pop metal sound of Trash and Hey Stoopid, and goes in a darker vein. The album brings back the character of Steven from the vintage Welcome To My Nightmare and Goes To Hell days.<br />The album is conceptual in nature, and it tells the story of Steven battling his own personal demons, and having a battle for his own sanity. Steven is tempted by wordly possessions and ultimately learns about himself and that his enemy is the devil himself.<br />The album is hard rocking, and standout cuts include Nothing's Free and Cleansed By Fire. There really is not a weak track on the album and is a good introduction to this underappreciated rock legend.<br />Alice seems to be back on track musically and his last three studio releases are musthaves. Hey Stoopid, the aforementioned Last Temptation, and the continuation of where TLT left off, the critically acclaimed masterpiece, Brutal Planet.
B000000OTY|4.0|Many musicians and bands like to put out a &quot;best of&quot; CD that features hits over a certain time period.  Peter Gabriel has the fortunate problem, however, of being so remarkably prolific in his career from Genesis to his solo work that it would be impossible to do this.<br />Secret World's live album can't hope to be enough in only two CDs - but it does all it can to show any fan the beauty of Gabriel's music.  More than this, it also shows how passionate and captivating his concerts are.  It made me wish that I could have seen him at one of these concerts.  The pictures in the CD sleeve also indicate a concert of beautiful props and great artistic expression.<br />With the wonderful opening of &quot;Talk to Me&quot; to the wonderful extended anthemic &quot;In Your Eyes&quot; the listener is given great insight to the essence of Gabriel's work.<br />I may have given this a full 5 stars, but Biko MUST be in any good listing of Peter Gabriel's work.  Such a powerful wonderful song leaves just a little bit of a vacuum.
0385486804|5.0|What an amazing book!! I am a nature person so just reading about the book was great. However the book is quite deep and is a sort of psychology analysis of the main character. The book offers an extreme example of a man who is sick of goverment and society. I think he was born in the wrong era. He was a fighter and truly appreaciated nature for its beauty.
B00004Z459|4.0|As I listened to Hybrid Theory bands started to pop into my head.  Papa Roach, Korn, and Limp Bizkit were 3 that showed up quite a bit.  But Linkin Park is not just another knock off band.  They have an original sound that uses those other bands as a stepping stool, and thats all they use them for.  The song &quot;Papercut&quot; may sound like a Papa Roach song, but it goes that one little step extra to make it sound original.  So if you like Papa Roach, Korn or Limp Bizkit this album is definitely for you.  I personally love the album, and would recommend it for anyone.
B000001GQD|5.0|It was Rachmaninov who seduced me into classical music. It was my first hearing of Richter's earlier version that hooked me forever on both Rachmaninov and classical music (I have searched for Richter's Piano Concerto #2 with the Moscow National Symphony Orchestra, with the conductor Kiril Kondrashin, for several years on disc. If anyone knows how I might locate a copy please e-mail me, very much appreciated.) When I hear this version I inevitably feel the profoundest exhileration run through my veins. I don't find Richter's version sentimental, perhaps darkly romantic, but rather a stirring and stimulating encounter. I remember lying in bed as a young man and listening to this concerto (Richter's earlier version) and being totally absorbed and distant from all else. My musical taste is eclectic but if I had to choose only one type of music, it would be classical music, and that would be largely due to Rachmaninov and Richter. This piece breathes with an emotional intelligence unafraid to go over the edge, and then some. So far, Richter's interpretations remain at the top of the chart in interpretation and execution.
0399146253|5.0|This is the book I've been waiting for. The insight in the good Doctor.<br />Her elbow in a cast, from being attacked, she still continues to work.<br />Her sessions with her close friend and confidant, that aren't on a &quot;professional&quot; level (her friend being a Doctor herself) - end up coming back to cause her problems.<br />Her bad judgement in who she sleeps with (*gasps*) comes back to REALLY haunt her.<br />we learn more about lucy and her finances (wow smart and loaded.  what a catch!).<br />we learn how devoted Kay is to her job and the truth... <br />while it is initially kinda hard to get into - there is just so much to absorb (at least for me).. This is the book I've been wanting to see for a while.  <br />Although this isn't one I'd put at the top of the reading pile by my bed - finish the one you are reading and put this one like 2 or 3 after those you REALLY wanna read...  Gee - somehow the pile never does seem to go down.
B00004Z459|5.0|After I heard One Step Closer on the radio I knew this band had something, and after listening to their whole album, I'd say Linkin Park is my new fav band. The best song on the CD has to be Points of Authority. Other good songs are Papercut, One Step Closer, A Place for My Head,among others. Buy this CD, rock fans, you won't regret it.
B00003CWNR|1.0|This film had great stars, but a terrible script.  It was so slow and so uneventful.  John-Boy and the rest of the Waltons were more exciting than this.<br />This film gets high ratings because it's a pro abortion film. There are only two young girls in this film and they both get abortions for different reasons. The story itself goes no where . No Plot, no memorable lines, no story.  Just a real snore.<br />I feel that just about anyone could have written a better coming of age story for this cast. This movie isn't worth the 2 hrs. to keep watching to see if something will happen.  Nothing does....
6305508550|5.0|I really had a hard time going back to work and actually working! This movie is great for anyone who is a cube dweller and has to follow stupid rules. I asked our Facilities guy for a drill when I got back from the movie!
0790734850|5.0|A lot of people agree that CHINATOWN, starring Jack Nicholson, is one of the best modern film noires since the genre's heyday.  I'd like to say that L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is well on its way to taking it over.  Bud White (Russell Crowe), Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), and &quot;Hollywood&quot; Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) uncover a major coupe in the city's organized crime ring and the twists just keep on comin'.  With charged action scenes, heavy drama and loads of style, L.A. Confidential is easily one of the best films of the nineties.  Kim Basinger won an Oscar for her turn as Lynn Bracken, a Veronica Lake lookalike who's the only character in the film with nothing to hide.  The extras on the DVD are just great, including the screen tests of Crowe and Pearce and the discovery that the first retro-gangster American film in a long time is headlined by two Australian actors.  With an all star cast, tight direction and an award winning screenplay, L.A. Confidential is a tough one to beat.  For all you fifties music lovers, you're gonna die for the sound track.  One of my top ten favorite movies ever, I very highly recommend it.
B00000K31V|2.0|This movie started off like it could have been a great low-budget tech thriller, but due to lack of consistency, poor acting, and patchy direction, it just falls apart into a mess of good ideas gone bad.  Sounds like a number of other Cronenberg projects...<br />Cronenberg has shown on a number of occasions that, when inspired, he can direct on a level with many other big names.  In this case, I think he fell for a good pitch during a time when the &quot;What is reality?&quot; idea was popular.  Unfortunately, this movie doesn't have a leg to stand on when compared with other movies that shine in this sub-genre.  <br />Cronenberg tries to slip all this by in a sleek and sexually charged package, complete with Jennifer Jason Leigh as a smolderingly sexy game programmer, and a game system with a nipple that needs to be tweaked frequently.<br />Jude Law makes several attempts to make his character seem real, but for all his trying, it comes across rushed: as if Cronenberg had a deadline to meet, and tried to make the movie in one take.  Leigh never really does anything except play her part in such an over-the-top manner that it's really quite laughable.  If you're looking for a movie in which these two stars shine, try The Talented Mr. Ripley for Law, and Delores Claiborne or The Hudsucker Proxy for Leigh.<br />All in all, this movie was more of a disappointment because it could have been so much better.  I'm a sucker for Sci-Fi, and I tend to make excuses for a bad movies that I like.  I can't scrape up any excuses for this flick, however.  If you're able to forgive unacceptably bad movies of the likes you would see on Showtime after two in the morning, than you might be able to stomach this.  <br />If not, steer clear.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I never seen Toy Story 2 when it was in the theatres but I knew before seeing it that when it cam out on video I would get it when it came out on it's release date. I got it, watched and was extremely pleased with it. I think that it was as good as the first Toy Story [which I also have]. It was nice to see that they showcased the story behind the origin of Woody. This is a movie that be watched over and over again. I highly recommend this movie to anyone if they liked the first Toy Story or enjoys Disney films in general.
B000021XR5|4.0|Welcome all to chapter no. 4 in the stone temple pilots story. I'd like to ask you one thing: leave all the drug abuse, jails etc. stories behind. That's yesterday's news anyway.... Let's talk about the music. This album sees the band going back to its harder sound {see &quot;Down&quot; and &quot;No way out&quot;} as well as continue to explore it's strong melodic sense {see &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, &quot;Glide&quot; and &quot;I got you&quot;}. These exemples bring forth some of the strongest, most emotional songs the band has ever written. However, the lowpoints of this album, for me, are the fast ones such as in &quot;MC5&quot; and &quot;Sex and violence&quot;, and the strange Jim Morrison tribute in &quot;Atlanta&quot;, which all seem to me a bit out of place.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|I bought it because I like &quot;black veleveteen&quot; and &quot;again.&quot; Now I'm afraid I'm going to have to buy all his cd's. its a &quot;My first lenny cd&quot; type thing here, if you don't know his work that well, buy it. Even if you own every lenny album, buy it anyway; bravo on this one for sure. :) :) :) :) =)

B00004SCX6|1.0|Please tell me how this CD's average rating is 3.5 star when the highest visible rating is 3 and the others are all 1 star??? Is it just an artificial boost for this unfortunate young cele-britney, &quot;pushed&quot; somewhat into the stardom she feels so &quot;reluctant&quot; to be in. I've heard this CD, some parts are catchy but all in all, you could spend your money on something else and feel more satisfied. I feel in general people are getting somewhat tired of the wining baby vocals that don't &quot;cut-it&quot; on stage. The first few months of the debut album was interesting but I suggest that Britney look into other avenues of the entertainment industry. She's a terribly good looking girl so may be film... but that's not very imaginative (kinda like this album)??? Thanks for reading.
B00000J2KX|5.0|It had been a while since I had seen The Shining.  This is one film that is really standing the test of time.  Sometimes horror movies lose their luster over the years but not this one.  It is still scary as hell!  <br />Jack Nicholson gives an amazing performance as the troubled writer who is taken over by the hauntings at the Overlook hotel.<br />Buy this movie!  It's not just for Halloween!
6305750750|5.0|I am getting fed up with people that berate this movie simply because they do not understand it or can't think beyond the surface level.  Yes, Jar Jar was irritating.  However, since when does everyone speak perfect basic (as English is known as in the SW universe)?  Just on this planet called Earth, we have thousands of different dialects of English, many of which are barely understandable by &quot;American&quot; English speakers.  Why wouldn't this be duplicated on a galactic scale, especially for an isolationist race, such as the gungungs, who don't have much use for, or chance to speak, basic?  Jar Jar's clumsiness is Lucas' Redemption Character theory (see: Ewoks).  No matter how bumbling stumbling stupid you are, you too can save the galaxy.  We can only hope that Lucas realizes that 10 years have gone by between P.M. and Episode 2, so Jar Jar will have plenty of time to study proper basic.<br /> Next, Metichlorines:  I did not like this explaination at first.  However, when I stopped to think about it, it does make sense.  It does NOT explain the Force.  It only explains the heredity of the force, why certain people can become Jedi and others can't.  The higher concentration of metichlorines you have, the better you can communicate with this mystical Force.  Given the fact that finding Force sensitivity, and Force heredity, is a very large part of the Star Wars story, this is a good explaination of it.<br /> Ok, the story: Any body who complains about how dull the story is remember this: Phantom Menace is not &quot;A,&quot; &quot;One,&quot; movie, in and of itself.  It is 1/6th of a movie.  A lot of people did not like Empire when it first came out because of the ending.  However, a lot of people today agree that Empire is the best (perhaps not favorite) of the original 3 due to story telling, cinimatography, and the like.  When you look at P.M. with the rest of the Star Wars stories, I think you will agree that the story is amazing and fits very well.  Perhaps you should read one of the books (Heir to the Empire, by Timothy Zahn is a great start).  This, at least, would tell you the name of the Emperor (creepy old dude shooting lightning bolts in Jedi) and who he was before becoming Emperor.  (Yes, the character is in P.M.)  Now, I will agree that the acting could have been better, but come on... Mark Hamill?<br /><br />Ok, bottom line is that Phantom Menace is not one movie but a single part of an entire story.  If you look at it as such, coupled with the (and I don't think anyone can disagree with this) SPECTACULAR special effects, I think you will agree that this is a great movie, worthy of the name Star Wars.  Even great enough to challenge Jedi as my favorite of the movies (though that has mostly to do with the fact that the Emperor's character is my favorite Star Wars character, and he doth rocketh much in this movie, if you know who he is... Oh, wait, what was the title of this movie? &quot;The Phantom Menace!&quot;)
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Lenny Kravitz has demonstrated time and time again that his musical creations are to be revered as musical art like to other.  His distinct singing voice and his aesthetic craftmanship with his guitar make him an all time great musician. I will bet my bottom dollar that Kravitzs newly released song &quot;AGAIN&quot; will at the very least be NOMINATED FOR THE BEST SONG OF THE YEAR at the Grammy's.
B00004XOWM|5.0|This Chocolate Starfish album is definately the best rock album of the year! Also along with Greenday's new album and Radiohead's Kid A album the best CD in years. My favorite songs off this record are: both versions of &quot;Rollin&quot;, &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, and &quot;The One&quot;. I am speechless about this album, but this is a must have for any Limp fans or people who might not even have liked there old stuff too much. However, I am a die hard Limp fan. All I can say is this is a MUST HAVE!
B00004XONN|1.0|Being a Radiohead fan and running out to buy it on day one of it's release, I listened repeatedly hoping to find something I could truly experience.<br />I ended up with nothing.<br />Kid A has to be the biggest dissapointment of the year. I wonder how a band so intelligent and divergent could have created something so weak? It sounds as if they were doing a bad impression of Aphex Twin or Stereolab, mixed with a little 70's Elton John. Bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. It's so bad I figured this CD is a difflection until they are ready to let go of their collective brilliance again and drop a real CD worthy of my convo.<br />Until then, I have Selmasongs by Bjork.
0451191153|4.0|It is difficult to brand this book as a novel.It mixes philosophy, selfishness, love and several other rarely discussed concepts. The first time I read this book I found that everything it said was perfect. But 15 days down the road the holes in the story started showing up. I started finding whole of Rand's so called objectivity a cruel farce. The story starts with the naked Roark and ends with a successful Roark who after 700 odd pages looked to be mightier and aweinspiring than ever. Toohey- the evil really went on to prove that &quot;the pen is mightier than the sword&quot;. All in all the book is powerful and is not for the weaker fun loving minds.
B000002U82|1.0|Man,   I really expected this to be good, all my friends have been taking about for the last 12 years and then I went out and bought it and it.....well it was really boring and it was just dumb, like you had to smoke pot or something to understand it or enjoy it.  man, was I dissapointed.
0385486804|4.0|Into The Wild is the true story of a man named Chris McCandless who gave up his money and most possessions to start a new way of life.  In college, which he excelled in academically and athletically, he began to like the workings of author Leo Tolstoy and forsake wealth and privilege for a new way of life.  Four months after Chris McCandless gave most of his money away and left most of his possessions, his dead body was found in and old Fairbanks bus in the wild of Alaska.      I was very interested in this book about what Chris McCandless thought he needed to do spiritually.  What most struck me about how different this book is was how Chris gave away his money and abandoned his possesion to go out and live in the bush of Alaska.  He felt he had no worries in Alaska and was free to do as he pleased.      &quot;I'll climb a tree&quot;(pg.6) was one reaction from him when somebody told him about the bears in Alaska.  It shocked me how unworried Chris was about going into the wilderness of Alaska and not knowing what could happen.  When people tried to offer him things he said ,&quot;I'll be fine with what I've got.&quot;  He just wanted a life with very little complications.      As you can tell I enjoyed this book very much.  This book may not be for all people though.  Like some people I was interested and somewhat agreed with the way Chris McCandless tought and how he changed his life.  Other people thought he was a complete idiot for what he did.  I highly recommend you to read this fantastic book about how Chris McCandless changed his life.
B00004X01U|5.0|Thank God SOMEONE is putting an end to the droning pop market that has swallowed this country whole. This Madonna record is nothing short of astonishing- a fun, pop-laced beat-driven throwdown that beckons back to her early 80's work. The first single, MUSIC, needs no explanantion- it spent 4 weeks at number one and has gone down to become one of Madonna's trademarks in such a short time. IMPRESSIVE INSTANT will be eaten up like candy by house DJ's whenever they release it to the clubs. A great trance romp. RUNAWAY LOVER recalls the fierce dance energy of classics DEEPER AND DEEPER, RESCUE ME, and RAY OF LIGHT. I DESERVE IT is one of those songs that just gets stuck in your head for days, and is her first venture into techno-folk. AMAZING is basically BEAUTIFUL STRANGER with a different chorus, but one almost wishes this one was on Austin Powers instead. NOBODY'S PERFECT is one of the album's highlights- a trippy ballad with amazing instrumentation and some of her most expressive lyrics. DON'T TELL ME is just a great song to blast in the car- a thumping R&amp;B number in the grand tradition of her classics SECRET and HUMAN NATURE. WHAT IT FEELS LIKE FOR A GIRL is a downtempo millennium &quot;EXPRESS YOURSELF with a beautiful pop melody and some great distant guitar work. PARADISE is a little odd, but an amazing work of art when you listen to it a few times. GONE, a finger-snapping pop ditty closes the album with a good hook and a good beat.<br />If Madonna had made Ray Of Light part II, as some people seemed to be expecting, then why would Ray of Light be special anymore? This music is some of her most clever, fun, and light-spirited work since True Blue, which is a great way to kick off her 3rd decade in the music buisness, with a call back to the sound that made her famous years ago. A must-have.
0345423496|1.0|This book was twice as useless as 2061.  It is a good short story that never makes it as a novel. As usual,  Clarke uses the story to publish his predictions for the future, but with this book that's about all you get.  The poorly developed characters elicit no empathy from this reader, and the plot is only ankle-deep.  I kept thinking that sooner or later it would have to get interesting when I realized I was three quarters of  the way through to the rushed and wow-less ending.  I read this book only to finish out the series.   Odyssey 2: 2010 left me wanting more.  And while Odyssey 3 was rather lackluster, 3001 is contrived and  downright juvenile in story development.  Read the Epilogue from 2010 and consider that the end of the story  because you will find no new revelations or answers here.
B000002VC5|5.0|&quot;I Robot&quot;, originally released in 1977, was the second release from the Alan Parsons Project. Today it stands as an emblem of what music can and SHOULD be...if all the major record companies were not more interested in image than artistry! I would really love to see Alan Parsons gain more notoriety for all of his hard work, and I believe that his albums would apeal to those who love the classic melodic rock such as The Moody Blues, Pink Floyd, Barclay James Harvest, E.L.O., or latter day-Beatles. In my opinion Alan Parsons has never released a bad album. Like everyone I have my favorites that hold special meaning for me (and in fact I find his 3 most recent albums to be some of his best work ever), but Parsons has never released anything that he will have to be embarrassed over a few years down the road! (I can't say the same for all classic rock acts, can you?) Well, &quot;I Robot&quot; is no different by Parsons standards of quality, it is an album that I can play from start to finish with not one bit of filler or fluff to be found. Of course this is a &quot;concept&quot; album, based on the struggle of man against machine, and this only helps to make the album more deeply interesting as a listening experience. The production, as you would expect, is pristine throughout. Eventhough this album was recorded in the mid-70's, it still sounds extremely full-bodied and clear on CD. There are plenty of melodic rock gems to be found here, such as &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Some Other Time&quot; &quot;The Voice&quot;, and &quot;Don't Let it Show&quot;. There is a touch of funky rock with &quot;I Woudn't Want To Be Like You&quot;, and a liberal dose of what would come to be known as 'new age music' on instrumental tracks like &quot;I Robot&quot;, &quot;Nucleus&quot; and &quot;Genesis Ch.1 V. 32&quot;. Come on music lovers! Hear what a real artist can do in the recording studio, pick up &quot;I Robot&quot;, you won't regret it!
B00004YKUX|5.0|While &quot;Solitary Man&quot; is an apt title for Johnny Cash's new album, I think it may have been better named for the Tom Petty song, &quot;I Won't Back Down, which Cash uses to begin the album.  To me, this song characterizes Cash himself, as he has battled numerous illnesses and fought for his life prior to recording this album.  It is due to this persisent, aggressive approach that Cash has came up with yet another outstanding album.  No, he isn't always in top form vocally.  However, the heart, sincerity, and grittiness that characterize his recordings are clearly present.  As usual, Cash displays tremendous versatility, with songs ranging from the tragic folk ballad,&quot;Mary of the Wild Moor,&quot; to the extraordinary, alternative bitter love song, &quot;One,&quot; to sweet love songs,&quot;Before My Time.&quot;  There are also haunting, dark, almost scary songs, &quot;I See A Darkness,&quot; and &quot;The Mercy Seat,&quot; two very poignant gospel songs, and a fun, attitude-filled duet with Merle Haggard, &quot;I'm Leavin' Now.&quot;  The themes in Johnny Cash's songs bespeak of his life experiences, leaving the listener with an authentic bonding experience present with very few other artists.  And that bond is present on every song on the album.  That he was able to record another terrific album after all he's been through only further increases my infatuation with &quot;The Man In Black.&quot;  Since this album successfully mixes strikingly up-to-date songs with old-time, nostalgic tunes, it can be enjoyed by listeners of all ages.  Thank you, Johnny Cash, for an incredible 45 years and counting of making heartfelt, consistently brilliant music and good luck with future endeavors!
B00004XOWM|3.0|I like Limp Bizkit, don't get me wrong. Limp Bizkit's guitar, bass and drum. Their first CD, $3 dollar..., was a VERY good metalcore album, the rest... just good-curious. What it really has shocked me from The Chocolate... it's been the beautiful song Hold On. I recognized immediately Weiland's voice and got very surprised. Surprised too with Durst, trying to put his ridiculous voice in the same song. This guy must have no sense of shame. There are 3 GrEaT singers in your country nowadays: Chris Cornell, Scott Weiland and Maynard James Keenan. Trying to sing in the same song with them I find it kinda masoquist. Anyway, and despite the voice and the stupid lyrics, Limp Bizkit make good music.
6300185311|5.0|Send Me No Flowers&quot; is the final big screen teaming of Doris Day and Rock Hudson.  They would team three more times, professionally - on a Doris Day musical special on CBS in 1971, on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; for a delightful interview in May of 1983 and for Hudson's final appearance before his untimely demise, in 1985 on Day's cable program, &quot;Best Friends&quot;.<br />Anyone expecting a rehash of &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; or &quot;Lover Come Back&quot; may be disappointed in &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot;. Those seeking and able to enjoy an adult comedy that is wry, witty, darkly funny and extremely well acted, should find this to be their cup of tea.<br />&quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot;, based on a successful Broadway play, is the story of the ultimate hypochondriac, George Kimball, played by Hudson, and his loving but long-suffering wife Judy, played by Doris Day. George overhears his doctor discussing another patient who is terminal and leaps to the conclusion that his time is almost up.  With the assistance of his sometimes sober neighbor Arnold, played by Tony Randall, he sets out to find a new husband for Judy.<br />Thanks to the chemistry of Day, Hudson, and Randall, not to mention their finesse and skill with any situation or line, this works perfectly. The talented direction of Norman Jewison brings out the best in all of the participants and they include Paul Lynde, in a hilarious turn as a salesman for cemetary plots, Clint Walker as a prospective mate for Day,and Edward Andrews as Hudson's patient but befuddled doctor, among others.<br />Ultimately, however, it is the team of Doris Day and Rock Hudson that raises this above the level of a merely pleasing comedy and makes it something really special. The natural give and take between the pair and the realization that this would be their last film together makes it slightly poignant.  Nevertheless, most of the tears you shed will be from laughing so hard. &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; will definitely send you!definitely send you!
B00003CX8J|5.0|Xmen the movie rocked. I loved his movie. All the actors were perfect for the characters they portrayed. The special FX were also great. Im looking forward to part 2 of Xmen. As for this DVD if you like Xmen...buy this, if your a superherofan...buy this, if you like good movies...buy this.<br />There wasnt a dull or boring part in this movi at all.
B000006TRV|4.0|For people whose first introduction to Pink Floyd was The Wall, this is the best and most original Pink Floyd album.  But, it really isn't.  It is about 25% too long, including songs that don't really add to the story and aren't that good musically.  The ideas here have been expressed in earlier Pink Floyd work, such as Dark Side of the Moon and espcially Wish You Were Here.<br />I consider this Pink Floyd's answer to Genesis's Lamp Lies Down on Broadway.  They are nearly identical albums in theme, format and structure.  They both have a cathartic grand finale and a hopeful epilog. Even the album covers are similar.  Only the Genesis album came out several years earlier.<br />Since The Wall is basically a rock opera, it works much better as a live show.  The recently released live version, Is There Anybody Out There, is an improvement over the studio version.  It brings out the energy and emotion of the story.  My criticisms of the Wall are minor, and the live version pushes the work into five star material.
076790382X|5.0|This book was so funny.  Written as a compilation of a series of newspaper columns, Bryson makes fun of everything from junk food to the English language, but, most of all, Bryson makes fun of himself.  I was reading it on a plane, and it was all I could do not to bust out laughing, and have my fellow passengers think me a lunatic.  Bryson's gift is in the rhythm of his humour, the way he nostalgicly describes the disappearing All-American diner or the post office community, then blind sides you with a sarcastic remark so sharp you laugh until you're in pain.  You would laugh, then stop and realize he is not just describing his own experiences, but those of everyone else's as well.  I look forward to reading his other memoirs.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Though this is Dido Armstrong's first album, she sounds like a seasoned artist. Her music is Lilith-esque, soft and well rounded with a penchant for higher meanings. Those meanings are put forth simply and clearly without, as in some cases, becoming childish. There are few albums that I can listen to the whole thing. No Angel ranks up there with one of the few I listen to all the way through, and its as good as Fumbling Towards Ecstacy-Sarah McLachlan, Harbinger-Paula Cole, When The Pawn,Blame it On Me-Alana Davis, End of The Summer-Dar Williams, Walking Wounded-Everything But The Girl and John McArthur's, HIDDEN. The tracks on the album are not only beautiful, but addictive, and once you hear them you'll never get them out of your head.
B00000I41J|5.0|One of the best recordings in Jazz's long history was made when five of the premire musicians of Jazz, Miles Davis, Cannonball Adderly, Art Blakey, and the other greats got together for this landmark recording.  From the first song &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; to the last song &quot;Bangoon&quot;, each and every song on this showcases the brilliant musicianship and uniqueness that this quintet had.  Miles Davis on his unique and brilliant Trumpet, Cannonball Adderly on the Sax, and Art Blakey on the Drums, as well as the other greats on this show their fantastic style excellently.  This timeframe of Jazz (mid 1950's to early 1960's) produced some of the absolute best recordings that Jazz ever offered.<br />Something Else is a perfect way to introduce a person who never listened to Jazz to the fantastic, complex sound of the Jazz world.  In my opinion, this is an album (CD) that every Jazz enthusiast MUST have in their collection, it is that brilliant and fresh and can be listened to with enjoyment over and over again.  Well worth 5 stars and more!
B00000BKDY|5.0|This was the first Maiden record I really got into.  I had gotten the double-record set of Live After Death, but this one...I got it for Christmas in sixth grade.  Yep, my mom bought me Iron Maiden, albeit grudgingly.  I don't how many hundreds of times I listened to that tape when I was that age.  As an adult, and having re-explored Maiden's entire catalog (after having seen the New Lineup on their small &quot;greatest hits&quot; tour last year--in a club!! When will THAT be possible again?!), this record still kicks all A@# combined.  Yeah, it had a very produced/processed sound, but that's what they were going for; it sounds like they started to incorporate technology into their recording.  The production works with the futuristic imagery to create an overall atmosphere.  That's what I've always loved about Maiden: they create a mood.  And Derek Riggs' cover art...man, words can't describe my awe.  The reviewer who commented on Adrian's performance--RIGHT ON.  This is his record; even if he only wrote three songs, they're three Smith songs nonetheless.  And I don't think I need to say more about his solos, especially in Alexander, for a long time one of my favorite Maiden songs.  Whoever said Alexander the Great &quot;bites&quot;...well, it's a shame you didn't &quot;get&quot; it.  I hadn't thought it possible that this record could be topped, then Seventh Son came out...UP THE IRONS!!
B00004Z459|4.0|I really enjoyed this CD.  A cross between Limp Bizket, Deftones, and Incubus.  If you like any of those bands you wont go wrong this one.  My favorite songs are #1,2,7,8,11.  For the money, you can't go wrong. Pick it up.
B00004NHCC|5.0|Unquestionably, this is one of the finest jazz vocal albums ever recorded. Ask anyone in the field about it and they will tell you that. The key, I think, was the simplicity of the performances, the eclectic mix of songs and Sarah Vaughan's delight at finally being given the opportunity to do a classic jazz album without pop overtones. Her previous albums for Mercury had been a small-group 10-incher that later became \\"Swing Easy\\" and a 10-inch poper that later became \\"Sarah Vaughan at the Blue Note\\" only the album had nothing whatsoever to do with the Blue Note. This was her premiere 12-inch opus and Mercury knew it was time to let this nightingale take flight. What resulted is one of those magic moments that only happens occasionally in the recording world--a timeless, exquisite, endlessly fascinating and entrancing moment in music that will continue to reach out and embrace listeners for decades to come.  I will never forget seeing it the first time at Famous-Barr's record shop in downtown St. Louis, Missouri.  It was like the globe had stopped turning for a few seconds--I knew instantly here was an album for all times.  Nearly 60 years after being recorded it remains stunning. Don't miss it!
0399146253|5.0|Patricia's best yet! I can't wait for her next one. I was completely entranced!  This is a must for all Kay Scarpetta fans.  What a masterpiece.
0767803434|1.0|This film is a real dissapointment.  Harrison Ford gives a credible performance as the President and Gary Oldman pulls off his villain role with panache.  But this movie simply doesn't work.  Overall the film is completely illogical and frankly a bit too patriotic, especially for someone who comes from Europe.  Maybe logic isn't exactly what people are looking for when they watch a \\"no-brainer\\", but this film is really too much.
B000002J09|5.0|I am hitting myself for not getting this CD sooner.  All those who call themselves a rock fan must have this CD in their collection, along with Dark Side of the Moon.
B00003CWTI|3.0|This film is pretty good.  The performances were excellent, I especially liked Tom Cruise and Phillip Baker Hall but this has to be one of the most overlong movies of all time.  It takes forever getting to where it's going but still, it's far from boring.  Although it is a bit overrated.
B00004XOWM|1.0|THIS ALBUM PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP MODERN MUSIC:TRASH TRASH AND MORE TRASH. MIXING RAP AND ROCK IS AN INSULT TO MUSIC AND FURTHERMORE, THE PROFANITY ON THIS ALBUM ISNT EVEN FUNNY AND MAKES THE LYRICS 20 TIMES MORE CHILDISH THAN THEY REALLY ARE, AWFUL VOCALIST, AWFUL MUSIC ENSEMBLE. \, ITS EVEN WORSE THAN KID ROCK AND OR KORN. DONT BUY THIS.
6305903182|1.0|The first one was good, the second was OK but this one really misses the target, in fact it's dead boring.   Probably the worst film of 2000, I doubt that any movie will come along in this year that will top this one in being BAD.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Oops, wrong site, but I wanted to  get my feelings across
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I am extremely pleased with the video and audio on this dvd.  This is the best I've ever heard on the surround sound.  This will be the DVD to show off your theatre.  The depth charges and fighting scenes are well done in 5.1 surround.  A++++ on the sound quality.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Wow! What a movie. A lot of people have compared this movie to American Pie, but it is much better than that. I laughed from the opening line to the end credits. Tom Green was brilliant, as usual. Not only was the dialogue very funny, but all the actions going on in the background made the scenes even more hysterical. Anyone that has been to college can identify with the &quot;Road Trip&quot; and the antics while on a road trip. Another definate positive is the lack of a &quot;cheezy&quot; lesson to be learned at the end. Definately a DVD title to buy.
B00004XOWM|2.0|When I first wrote this review, I was just glad to have the CD and I was trying to be the first to review it. Now that I've listened to it for a while, I must say, I am disgusted with this CD. The songs all are truly forgettable with the weakest lyrics I have ever heard on a CD. Even though Wes Borland learned how to play guitar, it wasn't enough. Fred Durst just wants money and hopes to get girls out of it. He doesn't care about his fans! It seems like Sam Rivers has all but stopped trying on the bass, because he now plays weak tunes with one or two chords unlike the fast paced complicated lines from Three Dollar Bill Y'all$. John Otto is a bad a drummer now as he was before, or maybe even worse. DJ Lethal seems to have expanded his horizons, but please, tell me something I haven't heard. Every song has about 20 swares in it, because Fred Durst thinks it impresses girls when he cusses overexcessively but it sure makes me bored. All of his cussing is careless, especially in the song Hot Dog, where he adds that word we all know in every long, and shows more than writer's block, but a bit more than a little stupidity also. But it's not all bad on this CD. Several of the songs show attempted enthusiasm in music style, but they all fail. My Generation and Livin' It Up try very hard to impress people, but they fail lyrically. The only good song on this CD is Take A Look Around from the M:I-2 soundtrack but maybe that had something to do with the fact that Fred didn't write the lyrics! Please, don't even bother. I'm disgusted, and to make up for it, I've been listening to Three Dollar Bill Y'all$ even more. There aren't any really lame songs on that CD, and none of the lyrics show as much sellout as Limp Bizkit. And I take back what I said about Eminem selling out more. I was wrong.
B00004X01U|5.0|When the first words of the album are spoken &quot;Hey Mr.DJ, put a record on. I wanna dance with my baby.&quot;, you know that this will not be a run of the mill pop album.  The funky title track kicks the abum off to a radical and musically challenging start, and unlike &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; it does not set a precedent for the album as every song has a totally dfferent feel.  After the funky, subtle dance feel of &quot;Music&quot; you are then lead into the in your face thumping dance tune that is &quot;Impressive Instant.&quot;  This is my favourite track on the album and you have never heard anything like this in your life!  Madonna sings well over the biggest beat which makes &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; sound like &quot;Cherish.&quot;  Then you are followed by a stomping dico bass and is brought to life by William Orbit in the first of his three tracks.  The sound of this and the previous track are so utterly different but they work together and they blend seemlessly- beat that if you can Britney!  &quot;I Deserve It&quot; follows which is a blatant tribute to Guy, but do we actually care as it is a beautifully sung, beautifully written, beautifully produced piece of folk inspired balladry which would be as much as home on a Beth Orton CD.  &quot;Amazing&quot; follows which is an upbeat dance track that will be heard at clubs and parties by thye end of 2001- for sure!  William Orbit takes the production credit for this and this is a truly banging tune.  &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; offers an interesting perspective on fidelity and i think Madonna wants us to know that she is just like the rest of us.  The song has an uncomforable feel to it and this is maily due to the precision production from Mirwais.  &quot;what it feels like...&quot; is a beautiful ballad where we find out that she really can sing- well.  &quot;Paradise...&quot; sounds like a track by &quot;Air&quot; and Madonnas breathy vocals i9n both English and french manage still to sound cool.  &quot;Gone&quot; sounds like a hip country-folk song but has that Madonna feel- with the line &quot;Selling out is not my thing, giving up, i dont think so..&quot;  we agree love! Best track on the album is probably &quot;Dont Tell Me&quot; which is something you would never have thought Madonna would record- its funky R&amp;B with fantastic jerky production- Madonna sings beautifully with a voice that sounds like Sheryl Crow on speed. Every song is great, well written and beautifully and Madonnas introspective lyrics provide her greatest album yet, which takes some doing.  Always inventive, never boring- Typical madonna you might say, but youd be wrong! She just gets better- beat that Britney!
B00004ZB9D|5.0|one reviewer called him the second coming of jimi hendrix. other people dismissed him as the most unoriginal brotha in music. say what you want about lenny kravitz, but the man knows how to come up with great songs and has been doing so for 13 years... for the uninitiated, this is a great album to discover his sound. i tend to like his funkier, r and b flavored songs ( i belong to you, it aint over till its over ) but the rock stuff holds up fabulously. of course, &quot;let love rule&quot; is the chesnut, that people will put on repeat on their cd players, as well as &quot;are you gonna go my way ?&quot; next time i go to new york city, i may sing &quot;mr. cab driver&quot; to a cabbie just to see what kind of reaction i get. get this cd.
B00004RJ74|5.0|I admit to not liking this film when I saw it in the theater all those years ago.  I thought it trite and that it suffered from multiple personality disorder, since it started out as standard Quentin Tarantino crime-fare and wound up a vamp splatter fest.  I'm pleased to say that repeated viewings have increased my appreciation for &quot;From Dusk Till Dawn&quot;. <br /> The Gecko Brothers, George Clooney (in his best role yet) and Quentin himself, are bank robbers and complete badasses.  Seth is the cool, collected one, self-assured and able to control his inner rage.  Richard, on the other hand, is dimensia on two legs, giving in to his blood lust as though it were a heroin high.  The two are on their way to a rendezvous with a man who can make them &quot;disappear&quot; until the heat dies down. <br /> For reasons we don't need to get into, the pair kidnap Harvey Keitel, faith-lapsed preacher, and his two children and force them to help them across the border.  The rendezvous takes place at ... a biker bar cum strip club built on the ruins of an old temple.  The kicker?  The temple/bar houses gazillions of vampires who feed on the truckers and bikers who frequent the place and, presumably, keep the bar going by selling  the cargo in their pirated trucks. <br /> The shift from crime to horror is not as abrupt as it sounds.  In several instances, director Rodriguez suggests that the carnage exacted on the bar's patrons is no more horrible than that Richie Gecko inflicts on the people with whom he comes in contact.  In a way, Richie is a vampire already, an opportunist who feeds on adrenaline and power. <br /> Keitel seems horribly miscast in his role, but comes off believably and even sympathetically.  Juliette Lewis is annoying, as usual, but that at least gives us some pleasure hoping she gets fang-fu'ed by one of the vamps.  The kid who plays Keitel's son is acceptable.  But the person who really shines is woodface Clooney; for once, his underacting really paysoff.  He even comes across as sympathetic toward the end. <br /> The extras and vampires are wonderful.  Other bar patrons who (mostly) survive are funny, macho cartoon characters.  Salma Hayek, in her too brief appearance, is absolutely electric. <br /> This is a goofy film that requires very little from the viewer beyond a strong stomach and a sense of humor.  I wanted a tad more backstory, since I was confused about the many types of vampires that seemed to exist - some were batlike, some were snakelike and some seemed wolflike.  I would have expected a little clan infighting among these different species and wanted to know more about how they came to be.   <br /> But that's not what this movie is about.
B00003CX8J|5.0|This movie is really good. It has a lot of really good action in it and i'm no fan of the comic books but i really liked it. The DVD looks like it is gonna be good too!!
B00000DHR0|5.0|Christmas for along time has been my favorite time of year, and there is nothing like hearing the magical Christmas songs of the season. On this CD, Celine not only gives you those classics, but she delivers new classics with same ferocity as the old. <br />The album begins with the beautiful traditional classic 'O Holy Night' which in my opinion is one of the hardest songs to sing 'cause I've done it and it ain't the easiest thing to sing! She executes it with such power and grace that anything that I've heard pales in comparison. The only version of worthisness is Mariah Carey's on her 1994 opus, 'Merry Christmas.' Pure vocal beauty and gift. Not only is her voice exceptionaly strong, back that up with a full choir and you've got something special. This song alone is worth purchasing this album!<br />'Don't Save It All For Christmas Day' Celine in fact wrote part of this song, one of the vary few that she's ever helped co-write on. Here she displays the fine vocal control she has over every word, every note. A POPPY Christmas song, but what can you expect, she is a POP singer.<br />'Blue Christimas' A great rendintion of this bluesy Christmas tune. Her voice suits the style of this piece perfectly. The viloins work well with this piece, another great song.<br />Bryan Adams wrote No.4 on this CD, 'Another Year Has Gone By', which is instantly recognizable as comming from his pen. Subtle and compasionate, it shines.<br />A new tune writtin' for this album, well maybe not this album, but a new tune nevertheless. 'The Magic Of Christmas Day (God Bless Us Everyone)' has the holiday feel through-out. Tubular bells at the beinning open this song, triangles and angel choirs fill the rest of it with Celine's voice filling in the spaces that need it. The Magic is in the package of this song. Classic.<br />'Ave Maria' I could use one word to describe this song. Gorgeous. I have never heard it done like this. Another extremly hard song to sing, the voice has to be in top shape to pull it off. And she pulls this off effortlessly, as she does with everything else. Schubert would be proud, I'm sure. She does justice to this gorgeous classic.<br />'Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful)' Another great version of a Christmas classic.<br />I'm not going to talk about every song on this album, there are 16 in total so it would take forever, but the songs I have mentioned above are reason enough to buy this wonderful Christmas album. Five out Five
B00003CWPR|4.0|Kubrick's final film is a lasting work of art, funneling touches of Bunuel surrealism through the authoritative tracking shots of the late director. Kubrick seems to be making an homage to himself, with the deliberateness of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot; and the austerity of &quot;The Shining.&quot; In all, a fitting triumph for Kubrick, on par with the late works of Welles, Kurosawa, or Bergman. When he died, America lost its greatest film director at the moment, a man who took the medium up to his level, creating one icy and cryptic masterpiece after another. Other than Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, no other American comes close.
0380789019|5.0|OK, so I've never been to London at all... but I don't think that matters. The world that Neil Gaiman has created is so vivid and teeming with exceptionally well-drawn characters that I never wanted the book to end.<br />In a way, it's like every other adventure story before it - &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;... the protagonist's physical journey parallels some emotional or spiritual journey and is marked by an intense desire to go home -- to have things be the way they used to be. We know, of course, that that's never the case. A million stories have been written along these lines. <br />So, why is this one any different? Maybe it's the wry humor. Maybe it's the clever dialogue. Maybe it's the characters who are so outlandish, yet so real at the same time. Maybe it's the twists and turns. Or maybe it's the villains -- Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandermar -- a pair of baddies who are so perfect in every way. They are the villains you've always wanted to root against, and they say the most perfectly nasty things at exactly the right time. I found myself grinning often. And the story never slows. As soon as chapters ended, I wanted to start the next.<br />I can, without reservation, recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy or adventure stories. It's like a fairy tale for adults. One that I will undoubtedly return to again.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|This album has left my speechless.  You can tell that Christina has matured as an artist since her debut album.  Her vocal abilities are phenomenal, and they leave you wanting more.  This cd is a must have for any Christmas collection.  Start your holiday season out the right way, and purchase Christina's &quot;My Kind of Christmas&quot;.  It truly is Christina's kind of Christmas.
0553278355|5.0|This book really captured me, in more ways than one.  It is an an autobiographical book taking place in the 1950's about a nineteen year old woman named Esther Greenwood, who was staying in New York City for bing picked to go to a meeting for young journalists.  There were many other women there too, and she made a few friends.  From the time she arrived, she was slowly getting worse mentally, but no one realized it...not even her.  She had many trials in her lifetime that led up to her breakdown.  First, her father died when she was nine, leaving her with a mother and a brother, both of which she hated.  She lost some friends.  To make it worse, her first &quot;love interest&quot; betrayed her.  All of these things made up her life that she hated to live.  She ended up in many institutions, and she ended up hating all of her counselors.  One put her into shock treatments, and the treatments scared her so much that she hid everytime she heard those words, fearing that it would be her that had to go through them.  The other tried to help her by making he talk to her mother, whom she could not stand.  She finally ended up confessing that she hates her mother and she always has.  From that point on, she felt free from everything.  Her first &quot;love interest&quot; ended up getting TB and got very sick.  His girlfriend, Joan, ended up in the same institution that Esther was in.  This upset her very mich.  She was never close to Joan, but when Joan was found drowned, her patents called Esther and told her that she was one of Joan's best friends, and they asked her to come to the funeral.  Esther went, and it was a whole new beginning for her.  From that day on, she progressed a lot.  She finally ended up getting to go home and she tried to lead a normal life.  <br />This book by Sylvia Plath was actually written about her own experiences as a nineteen-year-old girl in New York City.  The book was written just as she remembered, but every name was changed.  She committed suicide when she was in her early thirty's because of her life and the way it had turned out.
0399146253|4.0|I am a huge fan of the Scarpetta series and was not disappointed at all. <br />Considering the personalities of Kay, Lucy, and Marino and the day to day, life and death situations they deal with, its no wonder that anger and conflict emerges and dominates the interactions among the three, but it is also clear that the characters care deeply about one another.  To me that is the most realistic part of this novel and the previous two.  <br />For me, the plot involving Chandonne and some of the subplots were a bit confusing, even at the conclusion of the book.  Perhaps there will be answers in the next novel.<br />All in all I enjoyed it and felt it was a great read!
078322608X|5.0|I personally am an afficionado of sci-fi flicks;especially ones dealing with time travel or the theories and probabilities involved with it ! This film is not for those with short attention spans or who hate to figure out certain story details for themselves. You must pay VERY (and I do stress very) close attention to the timeline and details of this movie for it jumps in and out with the blink of an eye. If you don't from the beginning, then you are already lost my friends ! Just what are the Twelve Monkeys you ask ? I will not tell, for it is the basis of the film. It is part sci-fi, part thriller, part action, and major SUSPENSE !<br />Excellent casting and acting with Willis, Pitt, and Stowe.Pitt's looney tune role is superb and believable. Willis' character being literally pulled apart mentally and physically from one timeline to the next is chilling and mesmerizing. Do not compare it to other time travel films or sci-fi movies; This one is in a class of it's own !
B00004X01U|1.0|All I can say is what happened?
0790729989|5.0|This was the film, which I thought, really stretched Kevin Spacey's multi-faceted acting muscle (other than The Usual Suspects or American Beauty)! His psychopathic-homicidal role was chilling.Though, his identity is not revealed until later in the film, his whole execution of character was terrifying (as they say it's always the little quiet silent,harmless types you have to worry about). Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt were in top form. While the film is often compared to Silence of the Lambs, the ending is a real shocker and an emotional roller coaster ride for Pitt's character (this also flexed his acting abilities as well). The murders are hideous and grotesque to say the least. The one disturbing and vivid scene hard to forget is the discovery of the victim who is kept intravenously alive (barely)! The glutton victim scene almost made me lose my cookies as well.The special effects department is highly commended for a superb job,also...Certain scenes are not meant for viewers with weak stomachs !
B000002UAI|3.0|This is about as close as the early Beatles (as opposed to the vultures at Capitol) came to putting out a dud album. OK, it IS a dud album, but considering their scarcely believable schedule, it's no wonder. They must have been mentally and physically exhausted.<br />Sophisticated gems like 'I'm A Loser' and 'Eight Days A Week' are mixed in with the paint-by-numbers 'I'll Follow the Sun' and the pretty awful 'Every Little Thing' and 'What You're Doing' as well as some uninspired covers. <br />'Baby's in Black', 'No Reply' and 'I Don't Want To Spoil The Party' are all good tunes, but they can't conceal the let's-get-this-over-with approach to this recording. When you think about Dylan's output around this time, 4 Sale  looks like pretty slim pickings. Still, you can forgive a good horse one bad run, so I'll add one star.
B000002UAO|5.0|Why is Rubber Soul perhaps the best Beatles album of them all?<br />1.  No weak links.  Every song is solid. 2.  There is more vocal harmony on this album than any other Beatles album, and except for John's occasionally flat singing, they do it well.   3.  Lyrically, this is the album where the Beatles (particularly John) began to mature.  &quot;In My Life&quot; is a good example.   4.  Musically, things are starting to get interesting (Paul's bass playing is more melodic, for instance), but it is still fairly raw (not a whole lot of orchestration), which arguably makes the music more accessible. 5.  George makes two excellent contributions:  &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; and &quot;If I Needed Someone.&quot; 6.  Anything that would inspire Brian Wilson to do the Pet Sounds album must be pretty good.    My only complaint about this album is that it doesn't have a strong climax like Revolver and Sgt. Pepper do, but everything else about this album is excellent.  I personally single it out as the major transition point in the Beatles recording history.  BUY THIS RECORD!!!
B0000013GT|5.0|I wish I could have gave it more stars. Said to be one the hundred greatest rap cd;s of all time.What more could you want buy. Don't waste your money on immatitions.
0060273224|5.0|Sabriel is an immaculate book. Garth Nix weaves a classic tale of magic and intrigue. The world of Sabriel seems so realistic, that I feel like I can just reach out and touch her.This is most definetly my favorite book, and it is truly hard for me to say that, being an immense fan of the Harry Potter series. I recomend this book to anyone who enjoys a good novel, because anyone of any age will love this delightful book.
B00004ZB9D|2.0|One review above reads 'L.K. does it again!'  whatever.  Lenny hasn't done anything again - he just wants you to buy what he's already done twice.  What's with the over use of the 'greatest hits' album.  Assuming he's going to make some more albums in his career, he should wait a couple decades and then package up a REAL greatest hits album.  jumpin the gun a little aren'tcha Lenny? At least title it something like 'the hits so far for anyone who doesn't own my albums and needs to catch up'  what? too wordy?! P.S. where's 'Rosemary' on this one?
0684853523|5.0|...on my mind.  I had just finished his new book, &quot;On Writing&quot;, and was as exhilerated as if we'd been in conversation all evening.  That's how reading the book felt, as if he and I had been sitting at a kinder, gentler version of the Algonquin Round Table and just enjoyed talking about writing.<br />The conversational tone of the book only made it more enjoyable for me, from the C.V. section in which King described the events that shaped his life as a writer, to the end, where he discussed getting back to writing after his accident.  What comes across clearly and above all is his LOVE for writing.  He talks about it as being magic; those sudden flashes of insight, the glow he feels inside when somebody likes what he wrote, the sense of satisfaction when he rereads a first draft and thinks, this is okay.  It needs work but it has resonance and purpose.<br />I was really interested in the section that dealt with King's problems with drugs and alchohol.  In fact, I'm committing some of it to memory for those writer friends who think they're in some kind of hot fraternity just because they can toss back a few like Hemingway or Fitzgerald.  King commented that creative people probably do run a greater risk of alchoholism and addiction than those in some other jobs but, as he put it, &quot;We all look pretty much the same when we're puking in the gutter.&quot;  Exactamently.<br />I think that anyone who's a Stephen King fan will enjoy the book for the insight into a favorite author that it gives.  To tell the truth, I've never read one of his books; I bought this because I'm a writer.  So to the writers out there - especially the ones who have enough writing under their belts to know that they have SOMETHING going on, but aren't quite sure how to make the most of it - this book is going to be a friend.  I plan to keep it on my writing desk, where I can look up those phrases that I marked in yellow highlighter.  King is a guy with no pretensions about his writing.  He's a craftsman who shows you which writing tools he's passionate about, why, and how they work for him.  He takes you from words (and those little creatures of the dark - adverbs), to sentences, to paragraphs (the building blocks of stories), to the full story, with a superstructure of theme, symbolism, and honesty.  He discusses the nuts and bolts of a writer's life, from first drafts to agents and publishers.  I feel as though I've been given a guidebook to help me through when I'm confused or discouraged.<br />Mostly what I get from the book is a sense of joy about writing.  Despite setbacks, Stephen King loves what he does.  In every page, he conveys the same message - find joy in what you do, or do something else.<br />So, yeah, Stephen King was on my mind last night.  Now it's morning, I've finished this review, and with &quot;On Writing&quot; nearby, I'm ready to get back to the joy of writing.
B000002LR6|4.0|I was once lambasted by a industrial purist for calling Nine Inch Nails - &quot;industrial.&quot; He had retorted with a smirky, know-it-all smile - &quot;You haven't heard industrial until you've heard Ministry.&quot; Curiosity got the better of me, so finding Ministry's Psalm 69 at the record store, I snatched it up since I really liked the cover art. Very few times do I buy a CD purely on impulse so I went into listening Ministry with no expectations whatsoever. The only other time I've really been this blown away was listening to Public Enemy for the first time. Ministry builds up a sonic tank, armed to the teeth with grinding guitars, relentless beats - all welded with a masterful perfection to samples and pure visceral wrath. Its nastingly alluringly, drilling its brutality with the efficiency of a machine into your consciousness. I'm not a big fan of heavy metal/hardcore music, but Ministry is unresistable in its invitation to trash-dance, the chilling mechanisms of the sonics seem so cold and heartless - but that's what gives Psalm 69 its overall beauty. Ministry is certainly overlooked as one of the most important industrial bands of the 90s, their influence is undeniable. The centerpiece of the album is &quot;Just One Fix&quot; which is just cathartic energy translated into music. Its stunning, to say the least. Nonetheless, a few experimental tracks of Ministry run thin after the few listens, but with songs like &quot;N.W.O.&quot;, &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot;, &quot;Hero&quot;, and &quot;Psalm 69&quot; - make this album a landmark. Favorite moment: opening of &quot;Psalm 69&quot; - Sunday church congregation was never this much fun.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have a hard time articulating how this album makes me feel, and I can't describe the music like some of the other reviewers.  I feel the need to say something, though, because this is the best album I've heard in a long time.  I have listened to it countless times and haven't tired of it.  This is &quot;mood music&quot; for almost any mood.  I enjoy listening to it in the early morning, middle of the day and late-night.  It makes me happy, it makes me sad, it makes me think.  Although I don't pretend to understand all of Radiohead's lyrics, I feel them.  I feel the music and I appreciate (SO MUCH!) the creative minds that created it.  It's mind-blowing and epiphany-causing.  Seriously.  Buy this album.  Listen to it, over and over again.  Thank you.
B00003CX6P|1.0|Have you seen the version of this film played by Alain Delon (in the role of Mr. Ripley)? Do and compare. Matt Damon may be good at plain tear jerkers, but he is incapable of playing a psychologically multilayered character.
B00004XONN|5.0|I know there are already a ton of reviews, but I will press on...<br />There are four reviews at Salon.com that perfectly epitomize the different views of this record as everything from indulgent and overblown to delicate and achingly beautiful. The latter is correct, just in case your blank slate needs to paste on an opinion.<br />Radiohead have made the record that the equally brilliant, but much more accessible OK Computer only hinted at. They have basically create a massive soundscape. Kid A plays like the soundtrack to the first eager views of an alien planet. The stress is not on lyrics or themes specifically, and if those are the aspects you are concentrating on, you're missing the point. <br />At the risk of sounding pretentious, the band has redefined rock music, or, paradoxically, stabbed its headstone into the ground.  This is not an album about singles, videos, hooks, or rousing choruses. It is about imagery. On this note, I have never seen album artwork that more perfectly complimented the content of the CD. The world that the album introduces on the first track is shown on the cover, with its ominously discolored sky and mountain peaks, and a strange, underlying structure suggesting a wide, sweeping terrain that has to be covered to get there. <br />But I digress. I will stop trying to shove opinions down your hopefully eager throats. Buy the record and experience the most mystifying, attantion-grabbing record this side of Dark Side of the Moon. Yes, it is THAT good, but twice as abstract.
B000002LEE|5.0|I Remember Dave Navarro Is From The Red Hot Chili Peppers Album 'One Hot Minute' in 1995. I Knew That In 1987 Thre Was A Live Album Called 'Janes Addiction' Next Album In 1988 Was Called 'Nothing's Shocking' From The Hit Single &quot;Jane Says&quot; and &quot;Ocean Size&quot; The Album and The Video Was In 1989 'The Fan's Video - Soul Kiss [VIDEO]' and 'Ritual De Lo Habitual' Had A Hit From &quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; &quot;Ain't No Right&quot; &quot;No One's Leaving&quot; and &quot;Classic Girl&quot; Is Originally In 1990. Since In The Biography They Were Disbanded In 1991. They Were Back Together Again In 1996 From &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot; In 1997 Is Released.
B000001FI7|5.0|There's something about this Cd that only compelles me to play this only when it's cloudy or rainy outside. From the first track Mysterious sets the mood for this album. dark, moody intricate. During the first listen it mau sound like it's simple trip hop music but when you listen to it again you begin to hear that there's so much more. The beats are hip hop breakbeats  accentuated by live instruments, distorted scratching, weird samples and haunting vocals from Beth Gibbons. The result is a murky, multi layered  masterpiece that stretches the musical boxes used  to classify music.  My favorite cut on Dummy is the spaghetti  western flavored sour times but my other faves are Mystyerious, numb and Glory Box.
B00004XONN|2.0|Although most discs reviewed on this site seem to get a 4 or 5 star &quot;THIS IS A MASTERPIECE!&quot; review, I'm going to break stride and Kid A is a good album with which to do just this - and for good reason. I liked OK Computer quite a bit and was prepared to like Kid A as well, but even after repeated listenings I don't hear anything here that really makes me want to come back for more. I mean, I'm trying very hard to like this album! But essentially, Kid A is an album with maybe 2 songs containing something approaching a memorable melody. The rest is electronic filler. I would recommend not buying into some of the pretentious reviews posted here claiming Kid A is &quot;terrifying&quot; or &quot;groundbreaking&quot; etc etc...it's filler.
B00000K3D4|5.0|I'd love to write a glowing, eloquent review, but I'm afraid I can't... This movie reduces me to a giggling, carefree, bouncing little kid every single time I watch it! Sarah's been my hero (thanks for the name, mom!) and Jareth my dream guy since forever ago! Now, as manager of a video store, I can make masses of people watch it all night! *bounce* :-D
B00003CWTI|5.0|One of the most INTRICATE MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN, I think that everyone speeks rightly when they say that the movie didnt make much since or that it did not even weave in and out as much as everyone thought it would, But it is still an excellent film.<br />It does capture the viewer to the point that you have to watch everything and not miss one beat, much like a soap oprah but with REAL PEOPLE, they did not even look or act like actors, they actually did an excellent job of becoming those people. But in the end it leaves you wanting more and it barely answers your questions. I did figure out what the whole frogs thing was about, in how IT tied all the key players in the film together, but I never found any other significant parts in which they are all connected. Unsolved Mystery.<br />Reasons for the R rating: Sexuality/Nudity, EXTREME CRUDE HUMOR, Violence, Drug abuse, a guy orders porno magazines, multiple depictions of suicides-murders-and robberies, THE WORST LANGUAGE PROBLEM IN ANY MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN, not one sentence came out without a negative or derogatory comment or even a curse word which was a big dissapointment for such an excellent film.<br />The Film Plot: It didnt really have one, BUT it was supposed to be that \\"EVERYONE'S SO AND SO MEETS EVERYONE ELSE'S SO AND SO,\\" AND THEY INTERACT AND WEAVE IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHERS LIVES TO CREATE A SINGLE STORY THAT REVOLVES AROUND AN UNCOINCIDENTAL EVENT IN HISTORY (OR A FICTIONAL EVENT IN THE CASE OF THIS MOVIE.)<br />The reasons I gave it the 5 star treatment: 1:Tom Cruise (\\"M.I.\\"&\\"MI-2\\") and many of the other actors and actresses whose names are fleating at this moment.-Excellent job acting or should I say looking like real people in real life situations with a camera that just so happens to be filming everything. 2:The stories at the beginning that gave the film a sort of Twighlight Zone/X-Files appeal. 3:The message that it finally gets around to in one of the last scenes where the cop asks, \\"I GUESSTHATS THE HARD PART, WHO SHOULD WE FORGIVE?\\" 4:HATS OFF to the intellegent devils who put that together. 5:Thanking God it was only 3 Hours and 8 Minutes, if they would have weaved that plot anymore I would have weaved into a VERY DEEP SLEEP.<br />This is Acedog from THE LUCKYDOG NEWSLETTER: MOVIE REVIEW Have a wonderful Frogday afternoon.
B000002MP2|4.0|Dookie is a rare example of punk and mainstream rock mixing beautifully.  This album rocks with songs like Basket Case, Longview, and When I Come Around, and has amazing musicianship (how often do you say that about a punk band ?)  Billie Joe's guitar and singing, Mike Dirnt's bass playing, and especially Tre Cool's drumming are all incredible.  If you are not much of a punk rock fan, Green Day's music is very accessible, yet stays true to its punk roots.
0060920084|2.0|After having read another book by Bill Bryson, &quot;A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail,&quot; I was prepared to love this book.  Unfortunately, it came nowhere near meeting my expectations.<br />Perhaps I expected too much.  I suppose a part of me was comparing it to Steinbeck's &quot;Travels With Charlie,&quot; which isn't really fair.  &quot;The Lost Continent&quot; is really meant to be a witty account of the author's travels through America in search of The Perfect Small Town.<br />Unfortunately, the one thing that struck me most in this book was that Bill Bryson spent an awfully large amount of time driving in his car being bored.  He makes snide remarks about every person he meets who doesn't immediately welcome him to the community (and even about the few who do) but his description of his appearance and of his conversations with the locals lead me to wonder whether anyone in his or her right mind would really want to talk to him at all.<br />I did make it through the entire book, and I did chuckle a few times, but I am still looking for that witty update to &quot;Travels with Charlie.&quot;
B00003CWL6|4.0|American Beauty is one of those rare Hollywood films that actually dares to push boundaries, make audiences think, and - most importantly - impress enough people that it wins a much-deserved Academy Award.<br />American Beauty is many things; a not-so-subtle portrayal of the hollowness of consumerism and consumer culture, a coming of age story, a treatise on the Heideggerian notion of beauty existing everywhere.  It manages to weave all these things together splendidly, while leaving the viewers enough room to work things out on their own.  Some of the symbolism is blatant, and the shallowness in suburbia where &quot;nothing is as it seems&quot; is nothing new, and other films have probably dealt with it in better ways, but American Beauty manages to overcome this flaws mostly with outstanding performances from all the main actors, especially Spacey and Benning.<br />Some of the characters, especially Ricky's dad and mom, and occasionally Benning's Mrs. Burnham, are a little underdeveloped and two-dimensional.  Many of Thora Birch's lines to Kevin Spacey seem a little &quot;stereotypical&quot; of the &quot;angst-ridden teen,&quot; and almost push the boundaries of plausibility, especially in the beginning - &quot;you can't just expect to be my best friend just because you had a bad day at work&quot; comes off as forced, no matter how many times I watch that scene.<br />There is nothing special with the cinematography, and the cgi-roses are almost an overused, tired metaphor at the end of the film.<br />American Beauty is a moving, disturbing piece of filmmaking that manages to put some heavy philisophical concepts regarding art and aesthetics into forms that the average Joe can understand, and will satisfy even those who feel Hollywood turns out nothing decent anymore.  Sit back and enjoy one of the many gems that Hollywood turned out in its bumper crop of good films last year.<br />DVD Dirt -<br />The transfers are good, but not perfect.  There are minor black lines and dots throughout the film, especially noticable whenever there is a lot of color on the screen.  The sound seems a little quiet as well.  The commentary is supposedly by director Sam Mendes and writer Alan Ball, but Ball hardly manages to get a word in edgewise, and Mendes really doesn't share any earth-shattering insights about the film, although they do manage to talk the entire time, which is refreshing.  The behind-the-scenes featurette is OK, although almost seems like filler they added just to say it was there.  Some deleted scenes might have been nice, especially the entire original introduction, but I guess we'll have to wait for it.s and dots throughout the film, especially noticable whenever there is a lot of color on the screen.

B00001NFCY|1.0|For a perfect summation of everything this band stands for, check out the video to &quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;  The lead singer wanders around in a spooky castle with scary gargoyles, and falls into the floor.  Taking a few moments to sing into the camera (notice that ever so earnest facial expression), he baptises himself and finds himself on top of a sunny mountain, &quot;arms wide open&quot; just in case you didn't get the point. You get it, cause he just got saved, right?  Creed are Christian rock, with all the implications (fakery, no sense of humor, slick production) that the term carries (fairly or unfairly).  This, however, I already knew.  I didn't know, however, that they were the new Rush. Y' know, when the whole grunge thing started, there was a suggestion that it was a reaction to the big rock cliches of the 80's.  Maybe so, but in the end it has just replaced them with the even worse big rock cliches of the 70's.  Frankly I'll take some lipstick, fireworks, and songs about girls a million times before this overwrought, bathetic joke of an album.   I played it in the store where I work the other day, and all the employees were laughing uncontrollably.  Maybe, that's the value that it will have in the long run.  Pure kitsch.  But, considering that Creed are the biggest rock band in the U. S. at the moment, it's really not all that funny.
630476524X|1.0|If you loved the first movie, &quot;The Crow&quot; starring the legendary Brandon Lee, stay away from this &quot;The Crow: City Of Angels&quot;.  It is horrible - the acting, execution of story, and the backdrop (a  green foggy mist engulfs Los Angeles...sick).  This is an insult to Brandon Lee who poured out his heart and soul to make &quot;The Crow&quot;.  Vincent Perez is terrible in this film, he has no grace or rhythm when he moves, he has terrible fight scenes, he acts wimpy, and his dialogue is bad.  Only a couple of things good about this film, the name of the movie is cool, only it doesn't fit the material, and the tribute to Brandon Lee (VHS version, maybe DVD???) at the end of the movie.  In my opinion, they should of stopped with the first one, Brandon Lee as Eric Draven will always be the best.
B00003CX6P|2.0|...I think is the word your searching for. EVIL Plain and simple, I didnt just not like the movie (it was kinda cool in a suspense type of way, but the suspense never goes anywhere and the body count just keeps rising...) I didnt like the novel either (and it looks to me like the movie sorta slaughtered the novel and ruined it).<br />Reasons for the Rating: Male Nudity, blood'n'gore, alcohol abuse, drug abuse, language, terror and suspense, sexuality, certain sexual preference innuendos, murder, harsh violence, and a scene of suicide.<br />The Plot: Thomas Ripley (Matt Damen, \\"The Legend of Bagger Vance\\")is a noname childlike young man who has noone to love him or to take care of him, instead he has a WIERD POWER to forge writing and mimick voices.<br />He gets an offer to find someone he doesnt know but pretends to know and bring him back home, and when he goes the guy he finds tells him to stay for a while and live it up with him, because (IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE) he aint going home.<br />When it comes down to it Mr. Ripley wants everything this guy has including the guy. It gets even worse from there and ultimately leads to death and destruction, which is without a doubt what evil always leads to.<br />This is Acedog from THE LUCKYDOG NEWSLETTER:MOVIE REVIEW Have a chilling Holloween (by renting the classics).
0399146253|4.0|While I have read every Kay Scarpetta book written I felt woefully unprepared when reading this book.  There were far too many refences to previous books, I could have used a study guide.  Having said that I really enjoyed the novel and Cornwell's elegant writing.
0679879269|5.0|This was the most amazing book I have ever read. It was emotional, touching and wonderfully descriptive. As sad as I was after the book because the wonderful trilogy was over, I find myself still thinking about it at night. Never in my life have a read such a great mystery book tying in the bible and Adam and Eve along with fantasy and romance. I have also never stayed up until 4:30 in the morning still reading a book because I couldn't put it down! I would recomend this book to anyone wanting a new view of life. I can't wait until another Pullman book comes!!!
B00004NRWH|5.0|I have actually worn out my first Nickleback CD entitled, The State.  I have picked each track apart for lyrics, instrumentation and production quality and I must boast that Nickleback needs more exposure!  This fine group of musicians accomplishes it all in this alternative rock and roll CD.  I have selected the following tracks as my CD memory Mantra.  Track Two - COWBOY HAT/// Track Three - LEADER OF MEN - ROCK VERSION///  Track Four - OLD ENOUGH/// Track Five- WORTHY TO SAY/// Track Eleven - LEADER OF MEN - ACOUSTIC VERSION///<br />Then back to the beginning memory selections. Tracks THREE and Eleven explore rock and acoustic versions in LEADER OF MEN/// The other tracks stand on their own, but after listening to this CD over 400 times, I recommend the above mentioned memory lineup on your CD player.  Go out and buy this musical masterpiece.  It is the culmination of ROCK, ACOUSTIC, FOLK, &amp; POWER!

B00003CWL6|5.0|WOW, this is a very intriguing and powerful film.<br />Reasons for the rating: Male and female nudity, violence, sex, drugs, alchohol, mild language, mild blood, crude humor.<br />This movie is deep. Too hard to explain or even discuss or even write about on a 19 inch PC screen. It seems demeaning to put this work of art into mere words. I know that this movie contains a lot of wierd stuff, but it does get its point across big time.<br />The plot: two suburban families and the events that lead up to the death of one LESTER BURNAM (Kevin Spacey, \\"The Usual Suspects\\"). And don't be shocked or ticked, because the first sentence of the first narration states that he will die, and this story is why.<br />The reason for the 5 star treatment: 1: It kept my attention and interest the entire film. 2: The excellent performances by Kevin Spacey and the other actors and actresses. 3: The comic relief that relaxes some of the tension that builds toward the end of the film. 4: The plastic bag, THAT WAS COOL, I love photography and art, and that was talented and took hard work Im sure (In case your wondering that video was A REAL LIFE video filmed by the Director. 5: The clever ways they threw in the words LOOK CLOSER throughout the film. (ex. In Lester's Cubicle, and on one of the video tapes in Ricky's room).<br />An overall masterpiece and classic.<br />This is ACEDOG from THE LUCKYDOG NEWSLETTER: MOVIE REVIEW Have a Beautiful Suburbia.
B000000OAC|5.0|This is one of the first albums that I had when it came out in the 70s. Everybody knows the classic &quot;We Will Rock You/ We Are the Champions&quot; The rest of the songs on this CD are equal if not superior to these(with the exception of the horrible remix of We Will Rock You) Check out Roger Taylor's &quot;Sheer Heart Attack&quot; and Freddie's &quot;Get Down Make Love&quot; not to mention Brian May's brilliance on &quot;Sleeping on the Sidewalk&quot;- classic Queen-every song on News of the World is great. &quot;It's Late&quot; is probably the best &quot;unheard of&quot; song that Queen ever recorded. Not too many groups can come close to the extreme talent that Queen was- News of the World proves it.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|If you thought the last album was good, you're gonna love this one! It's the &quot;best&quot; Christmas album out there! Christina experiments with a little R&amp;B and remakes classics like &quot;Oh Holly Night&quot; and &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot; very very nicely -- Not to mention her vocals have improved ALOT! She sounds like the next Mariah Carey for crying out loud! You must get this album and also IMO this would be a great gift to others! Support Christina! You'll love this album, believe me!
0446605409|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read, and I read a LOT of books. It is funny, suspenseful, and simply a great story! I could hardly wait until DeMille wrote the second book, &quot;Lion's Game&quot;.  Get reading!
0783226063|3.0|I should have read the book &quot;Dune&quot; and its sequels about ten times. Then logically I had to see how that magnificent book could have been translated in a film.<br />I saw the film twice. The first time, I was horrified and disappointed; where is DUNE in all this? The only thing that really remains from the book is Paul Atreide's ascension as a political leader, his tranformation as a messiah and his quest to reconquer a lost political power. Definitely not the sharp, complex and detailed description of a raising society and changes of the balance of power that can be found in the book. Arrakis and its ecosystem is almost not mentioned (except to serve the story), whereas in the book, the real hero is this strange planet.<br />Then I saw the film a second time. As I knew from the beginning that I would not find what made me enthusiastic in the book, I took a closer look at the way the story was filmed and at the music. I looked at smaller details, and realized that at some points, David Lynch really tried to reproduce some of subtleties of the book, like for instance Paul's strong feeling that he cannot control his destiny. And sometimes he succeeded. But I am quite convinced that this can be perceived only by people who have read the book -- and who want to give to the film a second chance.<br />In fact, the film taken alone would be a masterpiece, if it were not constructed on a complex and rich science-fiction work. For those who consider Dune as &quot;The Book&quot;, the film can only be disappointing and incomplete.
B000001ESF|4.0|reading through all the reviews here reminds me of two very important facts; 1-how brilliant and underestimated by other followers of rock/prog 70`s music rush are! 2-the number of different reactions/connections/interpretations of rush`s music there are! it will be enough for me to say simply how much i enjoy the album as a whole(&quot;discovery&quot; of personal significance)and recommend this abum as essential listening to anyone with even the smallest piece of romance/fantasy/musical interest.
0679879269|2.0|I'm sorry.  I know it;s popular to praise Phillip Pullman as if he were the new writing god, but please. The Golden Compass was great. The Subtle Knife devolved into that awful Oxford literary crap, with stupid biblical allegory. This is a complex but overblown book. I am glad the trilogy is over, and pray that he doesn't add to it.

B000002JSJ|5.0|I don't see how people can call themselves huge zeppelin fans and say that this is the worst zeppelin album.  Zeppelin is remembered as a hard rock band, and Presence has the most hard rock of any Zeppelin album.  It is the only one with no acoustic guitars or keyboards.  The price of Presence is worth the song Achilles Last Stand alone.  In my opinion this song is better than Stairway to Heaven and is the best Zeppelin song.  It has great guitar work with many layers and a great solo.  This song, and this album is Bonham's best display of drumming.  For Your life is a great song, too, more of a slower song, though.  Royal Orleans is a short, funky song that is very good also.  Nobody's Fault but Mine is great, one of their lost gems.  The only real filler song is Candy Store Rock, which was released as a single I don't know why.  Hots on for Nowhere is also a good funk song.  Then Tea for One is a good blues song with a couple of blistering guitar solos to finish it off.  All in all a great album.  You should buy it for Achilles LAst Stand, if not for all the songs.
B00000I8UJ|5.0|This is the first Dexter Gordon albums I have purchased.  I have been collecting a lot of the RVG remasters as many of them are Jazz's greatest recordings, and the sound quality is unparralleled for an early 60's album.  This is a JAZZ GENRE must have, and althought I have not heard any more of Gordon's work yet, I understand it to be one of his greatest works as well.  This album has it all from slow ballad style jazz, to fast and techinically challenging pieces.  I highly recomend this album to someone looking to get into Dexter Gordon, or acoustic jazz.  This is a MUST HAVE!
B000002H6C|4.0|I give this Album Four stars for a few reasons. 1)The production is not that good,but in a way it conveys the albums message even further.The sound is cold, harsh, and unrelenting;which mirrors the bad side of our society.2)Jason is not heard in the entire album. Jason is an excellent player, but becasue of the poor production he is inaudible.3)There are some songs which are low quality, or lack any distinction.If you listen to the album all the waythrough(which clocks in over an hour)it is consistent and blends well. But that is the only was you will probably want to listen to some of the songs, becasue they dont hold there own by themselves. The songs that are always great are Blackened, One, Harvester of Sorrow, Eye of the Beholder. They are the right length and dont get too repettive. The title track is cool, but a little too repetative.The instrumental To live is to die is a tribute to their former bassist Cliff Burton(R.I.P), but you most likely wont find yourself listening to it that much. The rest are forgetable. Very intricate and the band stays on time always, but because of the production, lack of bass, and some forgetable songs, the album is not the best one.I rate this album higher than Kill em' All, but lower than Black Album, with Puppets and Lightning being above The black album. Definately worth getting for any Metallica or Metal fan, but not a great album to start with. It is not the fatstest or most melodic, but it is definately their most hardest album to date.
0060977264|4.0|&quot;By the River Piedra&quot; shows us how love redeems, how it sets free, how it complicates life to make it richer. In the story love in its varied guises visit the couple--philia, the love between life-long friends, romantic and erotic love, and love of God. <br />Coelho says: &quot;The heart decides, and what it decides is all that really matters.&quot; He elevates love to the highest position possible. Love is what really matters, just as St. Paul announced that love is the greatest, just as in myths and tales love always triumphs, even if death may come for it love survives for not even the grim reaper can arrest love's heart.<br />Coelho observes: &quot;To love is to lose control.&quot; How true! When love finds us it tears down the walls that have kept us within our safe little abode. We are ushered into a freedom, a soulful experience that cuts the cords that bind us to earth. We move into a surreal realm that all at once looks and feels more real than the world we've just left behind. <br />Coelho's works speak to our spirit and our soul, to a part of us that some  pejoratively call our naiveté. Those who have been disillusioned and enthralled by Reason and who no longer believe in anything except the things they can see and touch won't appreciate Coelho's stories of Personal Legends and the heart's call, of angels' tidings and the Soul of the World. Yet for most of us who still bask in our childlike inheritance of imagination and fantasy and intuition, Coelho is an elixir in a world that adulthood daily turns into a dreary desert.
B00004X01U|5.0|For an artist that keeps reinventing herself both musically, and physically, this CD should come as no surprise. I guess one thing some are used is to compare an artist's future work against its &quot;so-far&quot; best, which to me is definitely &quot;Ray of Light&quot;. I do not get into the habit of expecting the same type of music from all the musicians I listen to. If you are looking for a &quot;Ray of Light 2&quot; - look elsewhere.<br />Must admit I was afraid to &quot;explore&quot; her &quot;Ray of Light&quot; when it was released 2 years ago. Like I said, I turned out to consider it as her best. So, I gave her latest &quot;Music&quot; a chance, and Madonna does not disappoint a bit. At 1st listen everything sounded &quot;weird&quot; (except the 1st track &quot;Music&quot;, which is gets into my blood as the most danceable of the whole CD). However, listening to it more than once, I am conviced this is a good one.<br />My favorites are &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Impressive Instant&quot;, and &quot;It's Amazing&quot;, a trio that is sure to fire up dance floors around (very sultry!). &quot;Music&quot; replaces &quot;Vogue&quot; as my favorite Madonna dance song (can't stop listening to it). With ballads, I go with &quot;I Deserve It&quot; (romantic with such beautiful lyrics), &quot;Nobody's Perfect&quot; (a true statement in all societies), and &quot;Paradise (Not for Me)&quot;, which kinda gives me the blues.<br />Musically, Madonna is to be taken seriously. She definitely has the &quot;muse&quot;. Her music career history says nothing less, her music very mature (experience definitely counts). To me, she still reigns in pop music because, in part, she has the guts to be really creative. &quot;Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on, I wanna dance to Madonna&quot;.

0393317552|3.0|I read Guns, Germs and Steel to get some answers as to why the world seems so dominated by what is essentially Western Europoean Culture. Why did a small minority of dirty white people wind up dominating the world through technology and disease? Jared Diamond, goes to great detail to explain how goegraphic happenstance gave one group of people the ability to colonize the world to the detriment of all the others. After reading Guns, Germs and Steel the answers seem so obvious. This book is a great read for a mind curious about some of the big questions about why the world turned out like it is.    If the book has one drawback, it is the ecrutiating detail provided. For example, Diamond spends many pages describing the various species of wheat grown throughout the world. Though, he is correct in mentioning it, I found these sections of the book to be more detail than I wanted,and frankly, quite boring. This book is not a page turner, but an intellectual workout. Nevertheless, like a good workout it is for the results one does the excercise.
B00003CWL6|1.0|As I watched this movie, my reaction went from &quot;ok, this could still be ok&quot; to &quot;nah...doesn't do it for me&quot;.  I know that this is supposed to be a &quot;dark&quot; comedy, but I totally found it to be disturbing and I disliked all of the characters.  Kevin Spacey's acting is great, but his character totally going for his daughter's girlfriend made me sick.  I am trying to understand that it can be a fantasy for this middle-aged, exhausted man to lust after a high school girl, but that is called rape usually.  I think that in showing all the dysfunction in family life it is a sad commentary instead of something to be revered or laughed at.  <br />     Don't waste your time with this movie.  If you have never seen it before and want to get it out of curiosity, I beg you to not waste your time because it is not funny or interesting, but truly disturbing.
0679746048|5.0|Susanna Kaysen has an incredibly captivating writing style. Her attention to even the most minute and often overlooked detail is especially appreciated. I like to read the story that is behind the story and she tells just that. <br />What I can't understand is how obtuse the staff of the hospital seemed to be. I felt more connected to the patients than I did to the staff, they actually seemed more &quot;normal&quot;. What exactly is normal anyway? Kaysen sounds as if she would be a great person to know. Personality is everything and she has plenty of it.

B00004XONN|5.0|You know, there's a fine line between brilliance and insanity, and the beauty of &quot;Kid A&quot; is that find ourselves tossed back and forth over that line until it's merely a blur.<br />Not since Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; has a concept album left listeners so entranced and in wonder. And while the most common criticism of this record seems to be..&quot;What in the world does all this mean??&quot;.....that question itself is where the beauty lies in this project.<br />Musically - flawless, seamless. Sure, folks digging for anything close to a single could pull out &quot;Optimistic,&quot; or &quot;Idioteque,&quot; but even tearing out pieces of this work to get a quick-fix detracts from the work itself.<br />So put your headphones on in a dark room, and listen away. Or let it spin while you drive that long drive you've been dreading.  &quot;Kid A&quot; should be something you sink into and exist in, instead of trying to find it on the singles charts.  Ah, could it be that there is something left for the underground afterall????? We can only hope.
B00003OSTN|5.0|This was quite a sensational movie for its time involving themes of infidelity and incest. Joan Crawford won an Oscar for her tormented performance in this film. Crawford rises from being a waitress to becoming a successful businesswoman.  As she enters a world of affluence including a glamorous beach house, she finds herself in competition with her daughter for the affections of her scoundrel husband. The lovely Ann Blyth and foppish Zachary Scott play the semi-incestuous duo. Michael Curtiz turns in a solid directorial drama. George James Hopkins designed some memorable sets for the beach house and Crawford's business. Composer Max Steiner turns in another of his wonderful scores. Steiner is the composer who gave us that familiar Warner Brother's sound. It is interesting how Joan Crawford went on to make cult classics like \\"JOHNNY GUITAR,\\" \\"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE?\\" and \\"BERSERK.\\" \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is one of those great classics we don't see enough of.
B00004Z459|5.0|This cd rocks, especially for a debut album. From start to finish each song builds upon the one before it. The only bad track on the album is #11. All others are great. I particularly liked the two lead singers. Their voices balance eachother's well.
B00004THAY|5.0|This is a long time BB and Slowhand played together !  God, they can do that whenever they want !  Actually, i wasn't a real BB King fan ... but after listening to this cd i changed my mind, he's the blues himself ! This cd is a real tribute to the blues music.  Clapton is smart enough to set himself at the service of one of the greatest voice blues has ever known !!!
B000000OE7|4.0|Queen's recording history reads like a good book, and if Innuendo was the last Chapter (Indeed, it's last song 'The Show Must Go On' was as fitting a tribute to Mercury as anything they've tried since), Made in Heaven is the epilogue, taking the material Freddie Mercury recorded after Innuendo, and peicing it together into a comprehensive, final Queen album.<br />  The history is a little convoluted, not every track is brand new, a couple were from Mercury's original Mr. Bad Guy solo album (Made in Heaven, I was born to Love You), others were outtakes from The Miracle (Life has been Saved, Too Much Love will Kill You), Made in Heaven was original a Roger Taylor solo song that Mercury re-recorded in '88-89, but the rest of the material here is Mercury's dying days basically set to tape.  Even the older material is given the full Queen treatment by Brian May and company, so it all sounds fresh and new.<br />  The sound of the album is very uplifting as opposed to the overall wistful, dark overtone of Innuendo.  It's a Beautiful Day, Made in Heaven, and Let Me Live make one heck of an opening trio, the latter also sung by Roger and Brian, backed with a gospel choir.  I Was Born to Love You is given full Queen rock treatment with one of Brian May's better guitar solos, and the lead-off single Made in Heaven flows as only Queen's best songs do.  You Don't Fool Me is a great dancey tune, harkening back to Hot Space.  Too Much Love will Kill You and A Winter's Tale are two beautiful ballads, the latter a hit in the U.K., and the album 'closes' with a stunning reprise of It's a Beautiful Day, followed by an unmercifully long instrumental (over 22 minutes) that is really pretty unneccesary.  It never really gets going until the final minutes, and it's reminiscent of a new-age moods instrumental.  It tries to set a mood of peacefulness but doesn't quite work.<br />  The most telling work on this album, however, is the final song Mercury recorded, Mother Love.  From the secondhe opens his mouth until he closes it for the final time, you can hear the utter pain and longing in his voice.  He's through with this life, he has no more hope, he just wants to die in peace.  Brian May keeps a lonely guitar circling overhead.  And as Mercury sings the second chorus, and whispers 'Mother Love', it's almost as if he died immediatley after uttering those words, and ingeniously, Brian May finishes off the song himself.  After that is a quick snippet of numerous Queen concerts, followed by a baby's cry, symbolizing Mercury's rebirth into his new life.  It's enough to make any Queen fan break down and cry; why the album didn't end with THIS song I have no idea, instead it's thrown smack into the middle.<br />  Made in Heaven is among Queen's best works, even if most people dont' count it as a 'real' album because half of it has been done before, it's simply beautiful in context and Mercury proved that he had the greatest voice in rock right up until his all-too-soon death.
B000002UYZ|5.0|I always liked this album ever since it was released. I Prefer the Red to the Blue album simply because we get to hear the raw voices in their more formative years. Also, the concentration of most of these selections is about personal love found or lost. There is much less focus on social issues and commentary that you find on the \\"Red Album.\\"  Not only does the album demonstrate their ability as performers but also you can really appreciate their gift as composers and lyricists.
B000000WA4|5.0|If you want hits forget it. This band doesn't thrive on hit singles although they had a few on this cd. 'Zero', 'Bullet with butterfly wings' '1979' 'thirty three' and 'tonight tonight' are a good representation of the album, but there is so much more to this double cd album than that.  Billy has opened his soul and dragged me into his tragic world of enchantment, through the castles of sadness and regret he sings such beautiful songs they actually make me cry.  Corgan was courageous in making such a long album, but each song is unique and intelligent to appreciate.  It has literally changed my life. When I got it 4 or 5 years ago, it hit me right in the heart.  Finally music that I could relate to and felt real, not the crap on the radio.  If you are one of the sad ones too, I highly recommend it to you, even if you're not - you're just someone who appreciates great music, get it.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Every so often a film comes along that so completely fulfills the demands of its genre that all such films that come after it seem to be little more than pale imitations in comparison. Such a film is the 1981 German classic, `Das Boot,' undoubtedly the gold-standard against which all other submarine sagas must fairly or unfairly inevitably be measured. Since that film pretty much exhausted the great humanistic themes of brotherhood and survival to be found in this category of films, the American submarine films that have come afterwards `The Hunt For Red October,' `Crimson Tide,' and now, `U-571' have been forced to turn to high level suspense plotting to supplement the standard genre conventions. Each of these films has its moments but, the truth be told, one ends up invariably comparing these pieces of pulp entertainment to a genuine work of cinematic art and there is just no comparison. In a way, this genre, more than virtually any other, suffers from the cramped restrictions of its underwater setting. There just isn't a lot to DO in a submarine and, hence, the directors of these films are obviously very limited in the way they can approach the material both visually and dramatically. Thus, we are subjected to the endless tight close-ups on the men's worried, perspiring faces as they cast  their eyes upward and strain their ears during the inevitable depth-charge and how-low-can-they-go-before-they-break-apart sequences. We know that before long we will be watching that needle moving precariously into the red zone on the depth gauge, followed by the customary popping bolts, creaking hull and spouting water mains as the ship challenges the limits of its diving capabilities. (Not one of these subs, in the history of the movies, by the way, has ever failed this test). To get a little visual action into the picture, the cinematographer will, at some point or other, begin shaking the camera chaotically to simulate exploding depth charges a mere stone's throw from theship's egg-like outer shell. Unable to even approach `Das Boot's cinematic and technical expertise, `U-571' attempts to generate excitement with its action movie plotting and ambiance. Regrettably, neither the story nor the characters in this film are particularly engaging. Mathew McConaughey stars as Lt. Andrew Tyler, a naval officer who manages, through a complicated series of partly planned, partly inadvertent ircumstances, to lead a group of men on board a German u-boat, kill most of its crew and cruise around the North Atlantic in a Trojan Horse type operation, while uncovering the German codebook they have been sent to find on the ship. Unlike `Das Boot,' whose primary concern was to make its recreation of life aboard a sub as realistic and convincing as possible, `U-571' loses its way in a welter of action film histrionics, cardboard cutout characters and maudlin sentimentality. Taylor is suppose to be a second-rate, overly-sensitive officer whom the bigwigs trust so little that they refuse to assign him a boat and a command of his own - but do we doubt, that by finale time, he will have proven himself to be a leader in the true-blue military tradition? None of the characters in this film seem to differentiate themselves from one another in any way that would make us care about them. They all seem to be, essentially, a group of dressed-up actors playing at soldier a far cry from the fully fleshed-out and convincing set of characters that comprised Wolfgang Peterson's crew. Perhaps it is unfair to judge `U-571' in relation to that earlier epic work. (After all, `Das Boot' runs several hours longer than this film). Nevertheless, it is a measure of the true greatness of that incomparable German masterpiece that it literally left nothing for future films to add to the genre. It is all there in that one work complete and perfect in its artistry and form. Very few films sum up their genres as consummately as Wolfgang Peterson's `Das Boot.'
6304712944|5.0|CAMELOT. Joshua Logan directed this outstanding film. It is visually stunning and full of great emotion and yet seems to have a very great cerebral perspective overall in its effect. The picture wavers in tone and seems a bit episodic, but it does have skillful bits of genius tucked in among the gayety, pomp and circumstance, love, war and reflection. This is very uncharacteristic filmmaking from Logan. Richard Harris' King Arthur is beautifully underplayed and unfathomable at times. But he achieves some very effective moments in this unique telling of the Arthur legend. The movie is somewhat dark at times as it juxtaposes humor, which is biting such as is seen in the performance by David Hemmings and the screen presence of Franco Nero very foreign Sir Lancelot. It's a film that may grow on you each time you return to it. It did for me. CAMELOT is a highly underrated classic and somehow seems forgotten as Hollywood musicals were in their death-throws.
6300214400|4.0|I really like The Search for Spock.It's probably one of the more somber of the Star Trek movies,without a lot of humor,but it's still a great film.The Enterprise is to be retired,but Kirk and his crew steal it and race to the planet Genesis to rescue their friend Spock.Of course the Klingons want Genesis,too.The Klingon villain Kruge,played by Christopher Lloyd was pretty cool.Nothing personal meant to Robin Curtis,but it's too bad Kirstie Alley didn't reprise her role as Saavik in this film.The special effects are great,the musical score was very good,and it was great to see Spock alive and well!
038532653X|5.0|While looking for a new novel to read aloud to a group of fifth grade students, I stumbled onto Skellig by David Almond.  I expected a somewhat mysterious tale, and I wasn't disappointed.  What I was totally unprepared for was the beauty and strange sweetness, the well-developed relationships between the characters, and the touching ending.  I literally cried for two hours...ok, I cry easily, but I believe this to be one of the best novels I've read in a long time.  As a read aloud, I'm not sure if my students are quite ready for Skellig.  I'm going to pilot it this week and will report back when I've finished.
630242335X|5.0|Star Trek VI:The Undiscovered Country is my favorite of all the Star Trek movies.The Klingon empire is dying and Kirk (who hates the Klingons)is supposed to meet the Klingon chancellor to discuss dissarmament.The Klingons dine on board the Enterprise,and when they beam back to their own ship,two Enterprise crew members beam aboard their ship to assasinate the chancellor.Kirk and McCoy get charged with his murder,and then the film turns into an excellent whodunit as Spock and the Enterprise crew try to prove Kirk and McCoy's Innocence,and find the real assasins.The movie had excellent special effects(they went         back to ILM after not using them in Star Trek V,and the effects in that film weren't very good),and a good musical score.This was the original Enterprise crew's last film(with the exception of Kirk,Chekov,and Scotty ,who appeared in Star Trek:Generations),and it was the perfect way to go out.
0684853523|5.0|I have read many of the books written &quot;by writers, for writers&quot; and have almost always come away disappointed.  More often than not, the reader is subjected to 100+ pages of the master telling his or subordinates the &quot;correct&quot; way to write.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by Mr. King's book.  To tell the truth, I purchased it more for its memoir qualities than its instructional ones but the latter is was proved to be the more valuable.  <br />King does not tell the reader (the aspiring writer) how to write.  Instead, he gives concrete examples on what works for him.  He is also open to the possibility (gasp) that what does work for him may not work for someone else.<br />As for the memoir qualities, there really wasn't anything &quot;new&quot; there as his life has been illustrated in countless articles and TV bios.  However, his own take on it is priceless.
6300213803|5.0|I have to admit that I never watched the Star Trek TV series much,but I love the movies.I'd say Wrath of Khan is no.2 on my list behind Star Trek VI.The special effects are great,the musical score by James Horner is very good,and it's got the best villain in a Star Trek film,Khan.I really like the chemistry between the cast,especially Kirk,Spock,And McCoy,and I loved Kirstie Alley in the role of Saavik,it's just to bad she didn't come back in Star Trek III&amp;IV.Overall,I'd say it's a great film and one of my favorite sci-fi films.
0393317552|1.0|Jared Diamond, a physiology professor at UCLA, is a strict follower of the Stephen Jay Gould school of environmentalism. In this, his Pulitzer Prize reducing &quot;Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies,&quot; he attributes European technology, influence, and efficiency, not to European ingenuity or genetics, but to plants, wildlife, and geography. Diamond also asserts (with a straight face) that all racial groups are of identical average intelligence--except for New Guineans fresh from the stone age who &quot;in mental ability...are probably genetically innately superior to Westerners.&quot; (It's highly questionable to this reader whether Diamond actually believes a word of what he wrote in this book.)<br /> Prof. Diamond is no doubt right that a large industrial society cannot form without plentiful food, compliant animals and contact with outside areas. The descendants of a band of Europeans stranded on a Pacific atoll 5,000 years ago would not be building moon rockets today; a potential Newton would be too busy gathering coconuts to wonder why they fall. But it does not follow from this near-truism that just any human group with crops, animals and outside contacts will rise as high as European man--that, given these factors, civilization is automatic. It certainly does not follow that any two human groups will exploit these resources to precisely the same extent.<br /> In fact, different groups as they now exist plainly do not respond identically to identical inputs. The Japanese played no part in the creation of modern science, but once exposed to it they embraced it, and now lead the world in making cars, computers and other high-tech gadgets. Africans have been aware of European technology for just as long, but microchip firms have not sprung up in Kenya.<br /> Prof. Diamond replies that unlike Kenya, Japan can build on &quot;a long history of literacy, metal machinery, and centralized government,&quot; ultimately traceable to flora, fauna and stimulatinmg ideas imported earlier. However, the &quot;history&quot; of any individual begins at birth, so Diamond's theory predicts that Kenyans reared in the west should be just as adept at technology as the average westerner. But we do not find this.<br /> Descendants of Africans have lived in the US for ten generations, and have been immersed in its culture (and unconnected with Africa) for at least five. Yet black contributions to technology remain negligible. As is well known, American blacks reared from infancy in middle-class white households show adult levels of IQ and scholastic achievement barely above the American black mean.

6300268993|4.0|Superman II is a great sequal and almost as good as the first Superman movie.I've read that Richard Donner was fired from filming after he had completed much of the film.Quite a bit of his footage is still there.The rest of the film was directed by Richard Lester,who did a good job in what had to be a tough situation.The one thing that keeps me from giving the film five stars is the music.It's okay,but nothing like the first film.The score was written by Ken Thorne,from John Williams original Superman score.I've read that the reason Williams didn't score the film was because of the way Donner got fired.As for the plot of the film it's very exciting with the three villains Jor-El imprisoned in the first film escaping the phantom zone prison and coming to Earth.Meanwhile,Lois Lane finds out Clark Kent is really Superman,he becomes mortal,and they have a love affair.He finds out about the villains and gets his powers back,they have a very exciting battle over the streets of Metropolis,and in the end Superman wins. He kisses Lois and she forgets everything.It is a very good movie.

WHY DOES... is the one I can't get enough of.  If you are interested in Moby mixed with Blues/Gospel, this CD will be interesting to you.
6303212263|5.0|Superman is an excellent movie.It's fun to see him as a baby on the planet Krypton,watch him grow up in Smallville,and then finally find out what he was meant to do.Marlon Brando gets top billing as Superman's father Jor-El,but he's only in the movie for twenty minutes or so.It's Christopher Reeve that carries the movie as the Man of Steel(I couldn't imagine anyone else in the role),and Gene Hackman as villain Lex Luthor and Margot Kidder as reporter(and Superman's love interest)Lois Lane are excellent,too.The rest of the cast is very good,also.The special effects are great(I suppose a little primitive compared to today's computer generated ones,but that's beside the point),and John Williams' musical score is fantastic.My only regret is never having seen this movie on the big screen,so I hope they decide to re-release it at theaters someday!
B00004XOWM|1.0|Horrible - the first word that pops into my head.  This CD is a combination of lack of talent, lack of inspiration, and lack of quality.  There is no continuity to the album.  You may have a song that seems to give life to the CD then the next song makes you wonder how they ever got a record contract.  Please spend your money somewhere else.  I would rather spend my money on an extra copy of a Matchbox 20 CD than to get this garbage.
B00003Q43A|1.0|This movie suffers from poor acting by all involved, worse scripting, and even worse concept.  This movie lends new meaning to the term &quot;implausible,&quot; and it is so utterly bad that it is impossible for the viewer to engage in the temporary suspension of disbelief.  Boo.<br />Too bad, because I like Will Smith on the sit-coms that he has starred in, but I don't believe that motion pictures is the next logical step for his career.  I think he should stick to TV.
0812551508|5.0|Mary Shelly's 'Frankenstein' is a wonderfully horrifying look at one man's obsession and the evil that comes from it.  Victor von Frankenstein, a young and ambitious scientist, discovers the secret of bestowing life on lifeless matter.  After creating a hideously deformed being Frankenstein quits the experiment and leaves his 'monster' to his own devices.  Months later Frankenstein pays the price as the 'monster' seeks it's revenge.  Far from the Boris Karloff idea of Frankenstein's monster, Shelly's creature is one that invokes sympathy and pity as he is cast out from the human world and forced to endure existence without companionship.  The basic theme of the work is also an important moral- that obsession, if unchecked, can only result in despair.  Truly a great work and one that fans of horror have embraced for over one hundred years.
0684853523|5.0|On Writing is one of the most helpful books I've read on the subject to date.  It covers a wide range of writing components in sufficient detail without boring or overwhelming the potential writer.  King does an excellent job of demonstrating how his life experience influences his writing style and motivation.  I was surprised to lean of the number of movies I've enjoyed that are based on his novels.  Although he's not an author whose work I've read in the past, I have all intentions of catching up on some of his earlier novels and look forward to his future work. On Writing is an excellent addition to the writer's toolbox.

The story is told from the point of view of John Utterson, a lawyer and friend to the brilliant scientist, Dr. Henry Jekyll.  After relating a disturbing tale of an angry fiend assaulting a small girl, Utterson begins to question the odd behavior of his friend.  As he investigates further into the life of Dr. Jekyll he unconvers a story so horrific, so terrifying, that he can hardly believe it.  Truly a great work of English Literature, 'Jekyll and Hyde' is a magnificent story that takes the reader to the very edge of maddness.

Often times, movies based on books are sub par, with the common complaint being, &quot;The book is better.&quot; Well I, for one, have read the book and watched the movie, and I assure you that the movie is not a let down at all, but rather a triumph of modern cinema. The DVD disc itself is a little thin on features, but at an average price of about $15, anyone with a DVD player and a taste for Drama(or anyone who simply likes excellent movies) should own this movie on DVD.       Now, on to the movie itself. The Shawshank Redemption saw career-defining performances from many of its cast members,including Tim Robbins, who became a top star after his incredible performance, and Morgan Freeman, who added to his already impressive list of accolades with his perfect supporting role. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne, a Maine banker who is unjustly convicted of killing his wife and her lover after he discovers that she is having an affair. Andy is a true outsider in the bleak world of Shawshank prison, an educated man not used to violence and despair that are an everyday part of prison life. Robbins plays this part to perfection, showing emotional vulnerability, as well as the stregnth to overcome the greatest adversity. Freeman plays Red, &quot;The man who can get it all,&quot; a prisoner serving a life sentence for murder, who befriends Andy. Red adapts to his life in prison by becoming a source for bringing outside goods to prisoners.  The interplay between Robbins and Freeman is one of the highlights of the movie, as these two wonderful actors test each other's limits. James Whitmore plays Brooks Hatlin, a man who spends his entire life in Shawshank as a librarian. Once released,as an old man, Brooks finds that he would rather die that live another day in a unfamiliar world. His character is a tragic example of how the human mind can become so attached to its circumstances(even the blak setting of a prison) that it simply cannot let go of them. Bob Gunton takes a memorable turn as Bible-quoting Warden Samuel Norton, whose facade of morality is merely a mask for his depraved behavior and illegal activites.      Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed this movie,is a master of skilfully portraying human emotions. He deserves all the credit he gets for helping to shape this memorable movie experience. Stepen King's brilliance shines through, as his ability to create complex and memorable characters is evident in this movie.         The bottom line is this: The Shawshank Redemption is a monumental achievement in motion picture history. It is defined by a memorable story, engrossing character performances, and one of the most truly gratifying endings I have ever seen in a movie. This is truly one of the greatest movies ever made.
B00004YX39|5.0|1981's Gaucho was the last release the band had until the release of Two Against Nature in 2000.  Gaucho follows the pop-jazz path of their previous release Aja.  The album has all the Steely Dan trademarks: impeccable production, cynical and venomous lyrics and undeniably catchy songs.  &quot;Babylon Sisters&quot; opens the album with silky aplomb and then it moves into maybe the best Steely Dan song, the incredible &quot;Hey Nineteen&quot;.  The title track is an underrated song that doesn't get enough play and the album closes out with the crisp &quot;Third World Man&quot;.  Gaucho often gets lost in the shuffle as it followed Aja, but it is every bit a good as that album and ranks right up there with anything this great band has released.
B000002HRE|3.0|But it really isn't bad.  The fact is, MANY great metal bands had cds that sucked.  Iron Maiden had No Prayer for the Dying, Judas Priest had Turbo, and the fact is, Reload is ten times better than either of those albums.  What does that mean?  I don't know, but this album isn't bad.  It's not as good as early Metallica, but seriously, it's better than most music that is being made in this day in age, so give them a break, and be a little more open minded than &quot;it isn't fast enough!&quot;  So, what, music has to be fast to not suck?  Um...that'll basically mark off 90% of all music as being a complete suckfest.  Oh well.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten is Pearl Jam's debut album and it is still their best. The album perfectly combines Eddie Vedder's confessional lyrics with the grunge sound that helped make Seattle the center of the musical universe for the early 90's.  Often they are compared with Nirvana, but the band's approaches are very different.  Where as Nirvana were influenced by punk, PJ are more influenced by the 70's hard rock sound of Zeppelin, Sabbath and the like. &quot;Once&quot;, &quot;Even Flow&quot; &amp; &quot;Alive&quot; have growling Eddie Vedder vocals with driving guitars while songs like &quot;Black&quot;, &quot;Oceans&quot; &amp; &quot;Deep&quot; are slower and more pensive.  &quot;Jeremy&quot; can still inspire while the pro-choice number &quot;Porch&quot; foreshadows the political stances the band would take in the future.  The band is always thought of being so serious, but the album title shows a sense of fun.  They are big basketball fans and at one point the band went by the name of Mookie Blaylock who was an NBA point guard for the Nets and Hawks. Due to legal issues, the band changed its name, but Ten is a tribute to Mookie as that was his uniform number.  Title aside, Ten is a brilliant rock album and it justifiable made Pearl Jam the superstars they are today.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Non sono un fan di Bjork, almeno fino all'uscita del film di Von Trier. Ora mi &egrave; difficile pensare a questa straordinaria ragazza senza un senso si profonda ammirazione. Qui si parla del disco, naturalmente, ma credo si possa essere d'accordo che senza Bjork musicista (per non parlare dell'attrice...) il film non sarebbe esistito (qualcuno dice che, nonostante le musiche, non esiste neanche adesso). Il disco &egrave; bellissimo, pieno di quelle vitalit&agrave; che Bjork sembra poter trasmettere a qualunque cosa tocchi. E si sente, come gi&agrave; dalle prime battute del film - quelle per intenderci dove lo schermo &egrave; &quot;ancora&quot; nero e gli spettatori non smettono di chiaccherare... - che non stiamo parlando di una cantante, pur bravissima, ma di una vera e propria musicista, di un'artista completa. L'Overture, assai semplice, &egrave; magnifica. Senti un uso degli ottoni insieme ai timpani che con un brivido ti fa ricordare quel filo che da Mahler (penso alle battute finali della Terza) sale fino ai nordici...Grieg, Sibelius, Nielsen...sono attimi, inutile dilungarsi, ma capisci che questa ragazza ha visto il loro stesso cielo, e con lo stesso sguardo.  Delle musiche, tutte bellissime, vorrei dire qualcosa a proposito di &quot;I've seen it all&quot;: vi ricordate le ultime parole di Roy, il replicante di &quot;Blade runner&quot; (&quot;ho visto delle cose che voi umani...&quot;), anche lui uno che non potr&agrave; presto vedere pi&ugrave; nulla? Fate un confronto. Bjork parla di cose cos&igrave; piccole da essere immense, fa star male...&quot;ho visto un uomo tradito dal suo migliore amico&quot;...altro che le porte di Tannhauser e i raggi gamma! La voce di Bjork-Selma in questo pezzo &egrave; molto particolare: sta piangendo? sta ridendo? &egrave; rassegnata? soddisfatta? cosa vive di quel &quot;tutto&quot; che ha visto? &egrave; tutto ci&ograve; che c'&egrave; da vedere? o &egrave; &quot;tutto&quot; quel che suoi poveri occhi hanno potuto vedere? e non &egrave; forse la stessa cosa? Questa musica, forse anche perch&egrave; nel film si accompagna alla coreografia pi&ugrave; bella, ti entra dentro e non vuole uscirsene pi&ugrave;. Si sviluppa sul ritmo di un treno lento e pesante. Implacabile. Quasi tutti i pezzi, del resto, si aprono con rumori, rumori ritmici o che diventano tali nella testolina di Selma, che da qui prende ogni volta le mosse per danzare nel buio. Dove nessuno pu&ograve; seguirla, pu&ograve; capire...&quot;cose che voi umani non potete neanche immaginare&quot;.<br /> *a alla coreografia più bella, ti entra dentro e non vuole uscirsene più.

B00000DGUG|2.0|Alanis Morrissette had a great US debut with Jagged Little Pill, an album with a great variety of songs. Sadly, she joins the likes of Bush and Live as another artist who went away from a winning formula on a monster album. Like Live and Bush, Alanis gets all weepy and mellow on us while trying to sound very wise in the ways of the world. The new formula doesn't work. The only good songs are Joining You and So Pure, songs with a good driving beat. The rest are a bunch of meaningless, wispy, mushy, quasi-intelligent gook that Alanis picked up while 'discovering herself?' in the depths of India.
0517122707|4.0|Centinaia di recensioni in inglese, per questo libro scombiccherato ma perfetto (o viceversa), e una media eccellente (4 e mezzo su cinque). Allora e' il caso di rivolgersi agli amici italiani. Cominciate dall'inizio, per favore. Dalla scena in cui Ignatius fa' la fila assieme alla madre. Vi si apre davanti un mondo nuovo, fatto di pensieri lucidissimi ma, come dire, sconvenienti. Non e' un folle, quello che abbiamo di fronte, un imbarazzante grassissimo folle scoreggiante (ahim&egrave;, fa anche di questo!), &egrave; semplicemente un uomo che non fa sconti a nessuno e troneggia su un egoismo perfino commovente...ma tutto ci&ograve; non &egrave; forse ci&ograve; che potremmo osservare in gran parte dei nostri simili? Forse sono meno inclini alle flatulenze, tutto qui... Pertanto, il mondo offerto dal libro &egrave; nuovo solo perche' non l'abbiamo mai visto cos&igrave;, ma &egrave; proprio quello che attraversiamo ogni giorno. Solo, abbiamo - in genere - visioni meno radicali di Ignatius. Il libro tocca punte di comicit&agrave; piacevolissima, pian piano le assurdit&agrave; che propone ci sembrano per&ograve;...meno irragionevoli. Ha ragione, Ignatius, a restare quel che &egrave;? O per farsi amare, accettare, per inserirsi - problema che avvertiamo solo noi, osservandolo all'opera, perch&egrave; lui ha sempre ragione! - dovrebbe rinunciare ad una delle sue mille sgradevolezze? Ora io ricordo una storiella: un uomo guida la sua auto e sente alla radio un allarme &quot;attenzione, si avvisano gli automobilisti che un pazzo sta percorrendo l'autostrada in senso contrario!&quot; l'uomo spegne la radio con aria infastidita e commenta  &quot;see, uno, sono migliaia!&quot;. Che dovrebbe fare Ignatius, allora, darla vinta a quella banda di idioti? Epper&ograve; mai avrei pensato che quell'automobilista pericoloso mi avrebbe tanto intenerito...qui a mio avviso emerge la maestria di J.K.Toole: quasi spiamo Ignatius mentre sta da solo (&egrave; sempre solo, dannazione!), sistema le sue cose, i suoi fogli bisunti in cui riscrive la storia del mondo partendo, guarda caso, da ci&ograve; che pi&ugrave; lontano si pone rispetto alla nostra luminossissima modernit&agrave;...l'oscuro Medioevo! ed &egrave; cos&igrave; affettuoso con le proprie cose, con le proprie fissazioni...un bambino, davvero, che si chiude da solo nella stanza dei tesori... Non so se &egrave; solo bravura, quella di Toole, o se c'&egrave; qualcos'altro che gli permetta di farci alla fine commuovere per il suo magnifico e ributtante personaggio...non so, mi viene in mente un'altra madre, quella di Toole stesso, che per anni si presentava a scrittori ed esperti di scrittura per sottoporre il manoscritto del figlio morto suicida, un ammasso di fogli bisunti, appunto...fino a trovare chi sapesse finalmente leggerlo e farlo arrivare a noi. Grazie, signora Toole, ha fatto bene ad essere ostinata come suo figlio Ignatius, anzi Kennedy, ha fatto bene a non arrendersi a quella banda di idioti!he pi lontano si pone rispetto alla nostra luminossissima modernit...l'oscuro Medioevo! ed  cos affettuoso con le proprie cose, con le proprie fissazioni...un bambino, davvero, che si chiude da solo nella stanza dei tesori...

B00004Y7SF|5.0|I pre-ordered this album a month before the release, and boy am I glad I did.  I own all of Christina's albums, but I think that this is her very best!  Her voice is incredible, and it has really grown since she hit the music scene a year ago.  My favorite tracks on the album are &quot;Christmas Time&quot;, &quot;Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas&quot;, &quot;Merry Christmas Baby&quot;, &quot;Oh Holy Night&quot;, and &quot;This Christmas&quot;.  Forget everything you know about Christina, or think that you know!  If you want a record of an artist with true talent, pick this album up.  It will certainly cheer up your holiday and put you in the Christmas spirit!
B000003TAL|1.0|I bought this album the day it came out, as I had done with the two previous albums. I still own it, and at least once a year I  put it on and try to get through it.  I have yet to make it through more than one whole song per sitting.  Everyone I know loves this thing.  People were saying it was their best from the get-go and I still think it's their worst.  It's worse than Dirty and Jet Set combined.  It wasn't groundbreaking.  It sounds like Dinosaur Jr. already sounded, and the tour for this album was the first time I was ever bored at a Sonic Youth show.  They played the songs straight and without any spark of fun or energy.  I think the whole period surrounding this album is a low point in their career. I REALLY wish I liked this album.  It is the one record in my collection that remains as salt in my eye.  If it were by any other band I would have sold it years ago, but part of me still believes that one day I'll put it on and it will sound great.  Until then, I'll stick to EVOL and Bad Moon Rising.
0140277447|4.0|When dealing with Japan, everything is essentially political.  Or rather the Japanese have made it so.  So it seems it took a journalist, rather than a historian, to break the perplexing silence concerning one of this centuryfs greatest crimes: the Rape of Nanking and its subsequent neglect.<br />For the uninitiated, this book marks a great wake up call to the atrocities visited upon the people of China by the Japanese Imperial Army.  Chang hits on all the main points: the pure evil, the Emperor's involvement, and the current Japanese unwillingness to fess up and pay up.  If you are looking for a good introduction to this issue, I heartily recommend it.  If you want more data and less passion, I don't.
B000001Y2U|5.0|This album was the most darkest of it's time by far. It's a great album with great music. The beautiful people is not the only awesome song. My favorite song is Cryptochild because it sounds creepy but awesome. Even though I don't agree with his views on the christian religion, I still love this album. I hope his new album is like ACS and not like mechanical animals because i hated it. AWESOME CD!

B000006NPY|2.0|The Smashing Pumpkins were my favorote band for a really long time, so needless to say when Adore came out I was upset. It was almost a completely different band and type of music. Of course, things like Billy Corgan's voice and other set trademarks of the Pumpkins were there, but I don't see how an old-skool Pumpkins fan could like this album nearly as much as their others because it is nothing like it. Mellon Collie, while being on a different path than Gish and Siamese Dream, still continued with their original sound AND expanded... it was a nice mix. Adore, however, doesn't achieve this. I still have the CD because I guess I like to have the complete Pumpkins collection, but I don't ever listen to it. There are a few songs that I like but the album as a whole disappointed me. Maybe because they had lost Jimmy Chamberlain for that album. If you're an old skool Pumpkins fan, you probably won't like this. If you're new skool, you probably would. I would have given it one star but just the fact that it is the pumpkins made me give it two.
0553573403|5.0|This book has great character development and a lot of intriguing sub-plots.  It doesn't have the great atmosphere or charm of the Tolkein books, but does convey a convincing landscape that effectively backdrops the cadre of characters.  I will be reading the next book in this series, since there are so many loose ends...and I want to know what happens next!  Good books should leave you wanting more.
B00004XOWM|1.0|This album is a disgrace, it is a shameless rehash of their first two albums, with no new ideas or thoughts. The lyrics are terrible, aimed at angry ten year olds. Whereas 'Significant Other' was Fred's anger at his break up, here there is no heart in the words, so he just curses instead, but there's no emotion there. I liked the first two albums but this is simply no good.
B00004Y7SF|2.0|I am a christmas album collector and i must say Christina has a great voice but she doesn't know how to use it. She wails when the song is supposed to be soft and is soft when she should be louder. She goes from high to low voices to often. Plus the arrangements of the songs are so boring. I think the producer was depending a little to much on christina's voice to carry the album and decided to blow off the background music. If you want a great christmas CD check out JEWEL's Joy: a Holiday Colection. It is my favorite of all time. Not only is Jewel's voice beautiful but the arrangements by producer Arif Marden are amazing as well. Sorry to all the Cristina fans but she needs to stick to regular pop albums.
B00004XONN|5.0|I have to add my voice to the scores of people who love this album. I have listened to this record so many times and every time I do I hear something new, I have a new favorite song, I come away with a different opinion about the whole thing. And that is exactly what I hoped for given Radiohead's track record - to have an album that I would grow to like and appreciate with every listening and that would challenge my musical horizons while still being something I would enjoy listening to.<br />I don't want to be bashing other people's reviews too much, but I really took exception to the way a lot of people put their negative reviews. It goes without saying that not everyone will like this album but it is ridiculous to just write-off positive reviews as being based solely on the bands past work , etc.  One reviewer even had the gall to say that finally negative reviews were coming in because these were obviously real music fans who know what they are listening to. Come on! Maybe this is a hard album to recommend because it is NOT your usual fare and I think it is completely reasonable that some people will find it interesting and enjoyable and others will not. What I CAN say with complete confidence is that I love this album - I have enjoyed it more and more with each listening. I recommend it to anyone who has enjoyed Radiohead in the past, preparing yourself for the fact that it is not EXACTLY like any of their past albums, and I recommend it to anyone who is looking for something that is so different from what is getting played on the radio right now and who wants to explore what new directions music might be going in.
B00004TH6O|2.0|After all the QOTSA talk about how they're the band &quot;that just might save rock n roll&quot; I thought I'd give it a try. Well if I were rock n roll and drowning and QOTSA were the lifegaurds I'd suck in a big mouthfull of water and head for the bottom.  The album has no merit its very forgettable. I found the album loud ( wich is usually a must) but on this album there is no groove with the noise. My advice to you is that you borrow a friends copy and save yourself the money.
B00003CXFG|5.0|Okay this film does share alot with Alien, but it is still a very enjoyable film to watch. Vin Diesel was without a doubt the most interesting character in the film. <br />    Alot of good lines and overall acting made all of them pretty good. The effects were very clever and some I found spectacular. The planet coming over the horizen I particully liked.<br />     My only real complaints are they never really say what happen at the start. And they never really show what they eat as there doesn't seem to much else on the planet. They show the aliens fighting each other, but not so much eating each other. So what do they survive on?<br />    But still a suspenseful and riveting watch.
B00001NFCY|1.0|OK, I can live with the fact that Scott Stapp is weird looking and always wears leather pants and a wife-beater, and has an incredibly long chin. The thing that bothers me is that his vocals cannot be anything but a sad attempt at coppying Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam. Several times I have heard a Creed song on the radio and have mistaken it for a Stone Temple Pilots song from 6-10 years ago. The final straw was when Creed's bass player had the balls to insult Pearl Jam in an interview. Creed will never develop and have half the career that Pearl Jam has had, and is continuing to have. I have also noticed that about half the reviews here say they bought the cd because of 'Arms Wide Open'. If that's the kind of teeny bopper fan base you want then go ahead, but it won't last forever. In case you haven't noticed I hate Creed with a pasion. If anyone would like to contact me my e mail is coryjh@hotmail.com  P.S. I wasn't allowed to give zero stars, or belive me I would have.
B00004YKUX|5.0|Johnny Cash has a smash hit in Norway with this new album, which has been given great reviews in the media. This is simply an amazing album. He has been able to make the songs of U2, Nick Cave, Neil Diamond and Will Oldham all his own. Absolute stand out is the remarkable version of Cave's &quot;The Mercy Seat&quot;. Other top songs are &quot;I Won't Back Down&quot; (with Tom Petty), &quot;Solitary Man&quot;, &quot;One&quot;, &quot;I See A Darkness&quot; (with Oldham) and &quot;Wayfaring Stranger&quot;. Moving is also &quot;Would You Lay With Me In A Field Of Stone&quot;, written by David Allan Coe. When I write this, the album is no. 11 in the national charts and no. 10 here in Bergen. &quot;At San Quentin&quot; is no. 3 in the catalog charts. &quot;The Legend&quot; is riding high again, and we remember his tremendous performances in Norway in 1997.
B00004VXF2|1.0|To understand the 5 star review below, click on the reviewers name and read his other reviews.  Enough said.
B000002UA0|5.0|This is my favorite Pink Floyd album, because I'm such a fan of the curious innocence that Syd Barrett seemed to bring to all his work. After he left, the band did some other far-out things, but it never had the same good humor. It seemed much darker. They also did some very commercial things. Syd didn't - he was a pure one-off, for good or ill. I encourage fans of this album to get Syd's post-Floyd albums, &quot;The Madcap Laughs&quot; etc., and also his collection of erie outtakes called &quot;Opel.&quot; Also, seek out Pink Floyd's psychedelic singles from this period - &quot;Arnold Layne,&quot; See Emily Play,&quot; and &quot;Apples and Oranges.&quot; As for this album, it is a good example both of Syd's quirky songwriting and of the band's ability to do long echoey jams. In the sixties, anything seemed possible, and this album also benefits from the shrewd production of Norman Smith. My favorite track is &quot;Bike.&quot; I love how they bothered to cut the tapes and edit them together like that. Funny, good. Overall the album is a bit uneven, but that's only to be expected of an album like this. By the way, I don't hold with those who go comparing this album to &quot;Sgt. Pepper.&quot; It's like comparing.. well, Apples and Oranges, and everyone suffers when compared to the astonishing Beatles. This stuff is less broadly accessible, but it is a fine guitar/organ sound from 1967, if slightly chaotic.
B00003CX8J|4.0|First, I must say that it's kind of funny how many &quot;reviews of the DVD&quot; there are before it even came out. Still, like everyone else, I want to have my say about the movie, even before seeing the DVD.<br />I'm not a fan of the comics, in the sense of knowing them well and buying them. I might have bought a couple, and watched a few episodes of the animated series. What I saw I liked, but it was some time ago, and when I came to see this movie, I was missing a lot of stuff, even basic stuff, like what Rogue's power is. But I knew enough to know who most of the characters were.<br />The movie, IMO, was meant mainly as an exposition to next ones. It looked like this, although this feeling wasn't as strong as I got when I saw Spawn. There was still enough of a story and conclusion here.<br />I liked it that it's not a special effect movie. Yes, there are great special effects, but they are so well integrated, that they just look natural. The only time I felt an effect was a little forced was when Jean Gray shows her telekinesis power when she's working on wolverine. But generally the effects were so well done, that they did their job of fleshing an impossible world without drawing attention to themselves, and there was enough story to keep you engaged and not thinking of them (unlike, for example, Star Wars Episode 1).<br />What I really liked about this movie is that it's deep and interesting enough. It goes way beyond just action, or even character interaction (which is also done pretty well). The initial scene, with Magneto's parents being taken to be cremated by the Nazis was pretty strong, IMO (a friend I saw the movie with thought it was a bit too much to put a reference to the holocaust in a blockbuster movie, but I disagree). It puts in an interesting light the attempts to have mutations &quot;licensed&quot;, and allows some understanding of Magneto.<br />The idea of the character of Rogue is great. A girl who can't touch anyone - that's true agony. And then there's Wolverine with his lost memories. This really has the making of a great story, which is why, as the title says, it makes me interested in reading more about these characters.<br />The film also does well in capturing the sexy spirit of many current comics. Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are certainly very attractive women, as is Rebecca Romjin-Stamos. I guess that the men are not bad looking, either, but I'm not the best judge of that. I did feel that both Magneto and Storm were a little, well, smaller than I imagined them from my previous encounters with the X-Men series. But that wasn't a real problem for me.<br />That about sums it up. The main reason I don't give this movie 5 stars is because it was an introductory movie. If the second movie manages to keep to the standards set by this one, then it should be great.
B000002ULO|4.0|Paul scored a big success with this, his best work of the nineties. Why? Because he wrote good song after good song and recorded them in a straightforward, no frills manner that appeals mightily to the pared-down sensibilities of its time. A variety of moods and the ever-present McCartney melodies make this an extremely pleasing rock effort. (There are fine liner notes by Mark Lewisohn too, almost like the Beatles Anthology except this is new material!) There is one bit of dead weight, however: &quot;Really Love You.&quot; It's too long, and it doesn't go anywhere. (&quot;Great Day&quot; sounds a lot like &quot;Big Red Barn&quot; from the same era it was written in too.) But this is quibbling. I recommend this album. It shows McCartney as the pro he is.
B00004XMVL|4.0|This was a great movie. Most of the actors are new,but pretty darn good.The effects are wonderful and the story IS good. (despite what others may have said). It is a story SIMILAR to Aliens...but they are totally unaware of what is on the planet with them. They have a few &quot;obsticles&quot; (haha) on their mission in repairing the ship.  I have to tell you my favorite part is where that good looking guy with the shades does this cool thing (don't want to give it away) by staring the &quot;thing&quot; snap-dab in the face it is really cool.I would say more about the &quot;scene&quot; but I would give something important away. It's good! Trust me.
0783241399|4.0|\\"The Hurricane\\" is the life story of boxer Rubin \\"the Hurricane\\".  It tells of his plight in and out of jail for most of his life and his struggle to prove that the accusation against him is an unjust one.  It's a pretty good story with a powerful performance from star Denzel Washington.  Maybe his best to date and considering his resume that's saying something.  But not everything is peaceful in the film, as an \\"required for length of over 2 and a half hours in order to get near an Oscar\\" puts a ton of filler into the film.  <br />The story of the actual Hurricane is a good one, but then when others get into the act, the movie gets a bit dull.  Rubin begins his life roughly on the street and a confrontation with a perverted but respected citizen that tires to seduce a young friend forever lands him in trouble.  Officer turned sheriff, played skillfully by Dan Hedaya sets up Ruben.  He lives most of his childhood in juvie until his return to prison is spent usefully learning to fight.  The Hurricane becomes a very famous boxer for a short time until he is set up for a massive killing of people in a bar.  Again, the Dan Hedaya character is on his back.  Well, Ruben writes a best seller that garners little interest for some time but is resurrected years later by a young black man.  He compares his situation in life with Ruben's.  The young man lives with a Canadian group of friends that offer themselves as tutors to help him continue in education.  This is where the story gets long, as the group of strangers believe that Rubin is innocent.  The story now drags on as these pesky \\"Canadians\\" try to prove a black man's innocence in a still racial era.<br />The near ending with this \\"Scooby\\"-like gang investigating this crime is dreadfully boring.  It's near humorous that people think these people from \\"Toronto\\" are treated like a lower life form.  Racism is blind as well as stupid.  This might be a case of a sub par movie with a stellar performance.  You really feel theemotions of Denzel Washington.  See the movie for his roller coaster ride portrayal of Rubin if for nothing else.
B00004W5UA|4.0|Don't get up for a refill..you may lose track of what's going on..but this is truly a good movie. I am getting more and more impressed my the &quot;different&quot; movies that are making it to the big screen....Finally! Something different!
B000002LHX|3.0|You'd think Prince as a new character to represent Batman in this soundtrack would be a brilliant move filled with smart songs and hooky music.  Not quite as \\"Batman\\", the soundtrack has more filler than good tunes.  The highlights of this set (which nearly fakes funk on some cuts) are \\"Batdance\\", \\"The Arms Of Orion\\" and \\"Scandalous\\".  \\"The Arms of Orion\\" seems to be Prince's spin on the movie ballad formula of such songs as \\"Love Lift Us Up Where We Belong\\" and \\"Endless Love\\".  Those songs are quite swarvy yet romantic.  Prince along with Sheena Easton make this light pop cut lush with their passionate vocals.   \\"Scandalous\\" is R&amp;B passion at its height.  Prince draws inspiration from a soft soul sound that could make anyone putty.  Another steamy \\"Batman\\" cut.   \\"Batdance\\" is a combination of all of the uptempo tracks on the album that seem to make some significance together.  Provides some insight into the mind of lead characters in the film.  It's also a hot jam full of guitar blended with some hot dance.  Now the rest of the album...funk filler.  It's all faked too.  It's a real let down when you're expecting this kind of funky and fun set up for these people. It just doesn't work.  If you ask me, songs like \\"Partyman\\" just don't age very well.  \\"Vicki Waiting\\" is pretty good, as it's a playful set up for the relationship between Batman and Vicki Vale.<br />In all, Prince is much better than this quirky album.  It's beneath him. It's no that he sold out, I just don't think he gave enough intellectual insight into this album.  Could have been an eccentric masterpiece but feels like a let down with a few pop gems. Prince maniacs, wait on this one.  Again, this of course the Prince \\"Batman\\" album. Don't know how this remix with the really good Danny Elfman score got mixed up.
B00004U30D|5.0|This movie is beyond words..because it is beyond the usual. It is a great movie, to keep it in so many words. Kevin spacey is great (and sexy as hell, in my opinion) and Annette Benning plays a great Nag! haha! You will be pleased with this movie.
B00004XONN|5.0|I don't own a single radiohead album, so had no preconceived notions or desires to be captivated as a result of earlier music. A friend slipped it into my cd player and I was instantly sucked into the gorgeous tapestry that is Kid A.  I get the feeling that it either hits you somewhere deep inside and reverberates through you in brilliant ripples, or else goes right over your head. I'm intoxicated like I haven't been by an album since I was a teenager. Thank you radiohead!
B00003CXHJ|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves either drama, action, or combat movies. I am an enormous movie lover and I know good movies and great actors when I see one, so you can take my advice to the bank. Watch it and you will see. As far as the person, above, being upset because this wasn't &quot;how it happened&quot; I think you should stop &quot;JUDGING&quot; the movie on it's truth and look at it as the good movie it is. Maybe the true story would have been less entertaining. I hate it when someone tries to ruin a great movie with judgment likes yours.
0399146253|2.0|Wow.  I am very disappointed with this latest Kay Scarpetts novel.  <br />The first thirty-some pages are consumed by Kay's indignation over becoming a victim; a deformed maniac has come after Kay, his pursuer.  I had to laugh that Kay was so troubled by this latest victimization, given that she has been stalked and nearly killed by at least three different serial killers whom she likewise investigated in past novels.  Why is she acting like this is a first?!  She should be used to being nearly murdered by now.  Par for the course.<br />Oh, Patricia, work harder next time.
B00004RF0E|5.0|This is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies. I had to buy this one to go with my collection of favorites. and I only buy movies when I think they are good enough to watch over and over again! Some people may think &quot;people killing big bugs?-GEEZE?&quot; but this is really a good movie. If you do not like Sci-fi...don't waste your time..this is a true sci-fi lover movie. ENJOY!
B00004XONN|3.0|Brilliant? Come on, the hype for this album has got to be the next wonder of the modern world. &quot;Sounds like Super Mario&quot; isn't a far off description to me at all on some of these tracks(the first few in particular),and comparing this album to Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon is ridiculous.     That being said, Kid A does have a fair amount of material that makes the album worth at least listening to. How to Disappear Completely is great, a nice reminder of why I picked up the Bends(seems like forever ago.)Treefingers sets the right mood for the remainder of Kid A, which is decent and surprisingly a touch softer than I expected.      It's an interesting album, no question. I will never get the mass popularity though. The need for something different must have taken a lot of people over the edge in recent years, I don't know. Fart into a trumpet, process it through a synth. and paste some vocals over the result and you get descriptions  like &quot;brilliant!&quot; &quot;astonishing!&quot; I don't mean this towards Kid A in specific, it serves its purpose, but the whole electronica industry in general.      Like most bands gone experimental, I really think Radiohead was just plain better when they used more guitar work.
0792140346|5.0|Excellent movie..you'll see. And if you liked this..you'd like &quot;Shattered&quot; with Tom Berringer.

0800141326|5.0|If you aren't into Science Fiction, don't waste these pages for negative comments, cause this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.If you don't like Sci-fi, you won't like it..but otherwise..you will.Plain and simple. I HAD to buy it...I have seen it over and over..MAN IT WAS SOOOOO GOOD! This, with the Jurassic Park movies are the greatest &quot;large main character&quot; movies I have ever seen. AMAZING special effects! I wanted to pet him! :)
B000005JA8|5.0|Being about the 79th or 80th review on this, I'm can't think of too much more to say without being repetitive. I can say that the music on this album, like some of the great classical works, must be actively listened to. Allow no distractions get in the way of your listening, headphones work nicely for this album. I had looked at this album in stores  out of couriosity. I had heard people say he was being weird for weirdness sake, that his fans beleived he took more acid than anyone else on earth. Deciding to play it safe, I got THE SPOTLIGHT KID/THE CLEAR SPOT, &quot;the Beef heart album to start with&quot; as most people called it adn made one album after &quot;Trout&quot;. It was certainly something to hear. Having being convinced that Beefheart was not a charlatan after hearing the phenominal, &quot;Big Eyed Beans From Venus,&quot; I decided I would get this album.             I was suprised and delighted as the first track,&quot;Frownland&quot; concluded. It is still hard to put into words exactly what I felt at each track but let me tell you that almost each track conjures a diffrent emotion, don't be suprised if you feel something you never felt before while hearing this one. For some listeners this will sound like total chaos; unorganized, uninspired, unlistenable. An experienced listener will find out that these songs are meticulously contructed. Obsessivley realized.       I couldn't help but think of Sun RA when I first litened to Trout. Like Sun Ra, Beefheart took a totally different approach to music.They had no label for it, it was totally thier own, and people are still trying to emulate it today. And Beefheart is, as many interviews will convince you, not a wierdo. The man has a great sense of humor and saw music as the most important element of life.             I would very much like to see the follow up  ,&quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot;  re-released so us that have just discovered him can have the priviledge of hearing him at his creative peak. I'll have to do with the English collection(although very well done) called&quot;A Carrot is as Close to A Diamond as a Rabbit Gets&quot; and the other english release &quot; Shiny Beast(Bat Chain Puller)&quot;. All a slightly diffrent turn from &quot;Trout&quot; but it is still prime Beefheart.                 This album is Indespensible. Everyone can appreciate it with time. It is best to hear this one all the way through although it is quite a long one. Now I have only had this album for 2 weeks, so I still have more to learn from it. Being 19, I know that I will come back to this album many, many times. It has already changed the way I think about a lot of music and how to appraoch making music.                 One may feel sad, uplifted, scared, intrigued, overjoyed, so much comes from just nearly 80 minutes. The final track is one of the greatest outros in music history and markes a high point in my music experiences.  I can't suggest hearing clips or sampling it before you buy it, if your are even marginally courious, get it.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is my first Alternative cd. I don't normally listen to bands like Linkin Park. But I just saw the video for ONE STEP CLOSER one day when I was sick @ home from school. I thought it was good and that they will be huge one day. Then I went out and bought the cd on October 25th and now they are my fav. band   I know theyre going to be huge.  EVERYONE SHOULD GET HYBRID THEORY!!!
6303149200|5.0|This film actually accomplishes, and brilliantly, what the dreadfully bad TV version of Thomas Tryon's Harvest Home, starring Bette Davis, attempted some years back -- the convincing portrayal of a survival of paganism into the modern era. (Christopher Lee's explanation of how Summerisle came to be as it is may not be wholly convincing, but at least it avoids the problem that the Tryon film walked right into -- accounting for how such a strange environment somehow missed being subsumed by the modern world). The rituals and songs of the islanders were easily the most convincing examples of otherworldly practices I have ever seen in a fantasy film (no Maria Ouspenskaya gypsies here!). I was particularly impressed by the way that the screenwriter, Anthony Shaffer, refused to make Sergeant Howie &quot;lovable&quot;, but, rather, allowed him to be as humorless and dogmatic as a real Scottish Presbyterian would be if confronted with this horrible situation. At the same time, his courage and sense of duty make him a real hero -- and Woodward, a splendid actor, conveys all of this human complexity to perfection. The chilling matter-of-factness with which the villagers present their bizarre beliefs is infinitely more disturbing than any no-don't-go-to-Castle-Dracula-tonight-good-sir nonsense would have been.
0446608955|5.0|Nicholas Sparks dose wonders to pull you into a whole new world with vivid discriptions of the surroundings and characters emotions. It's a true tear jerker that pulls at every heart string even if you're not the emotional type. <br />The end of the story keeps you thinking for days. Though you know the ending even before the story is through the last like makes you rethink everything you think you know and put down the book with a longing for more.<br />It's truly the best book I've read in a long time.
0425107469|5.0|I have read about all of Dean Koontz's books, so he is has not wrote a bad book yet.  Some are slow starters and some are alittle long in detail.  This book is one of his best.  I say everyone should read it because I could not put it down.  This is a good book nomatter who you are because when the book is over you are still wanting to know what else happens to them.
B0000004V2|5.0|This is AMAZING! 'I want to b adored' is just PURE GOLD!
B00000HZFH|5.0|I am 14 years old and i am a hard core skateboarder.  I got this Skateboard video and it has a pro named Mark Johnson Skating to this awsome music.  i didn't know who the band was but i wanted to find out so i looked at the credits and found out that it was Built to spill.  I surfed the internet and found out alot about BtS and I knew i wanted BtS's Keep it like a secret album.  I orded it from Hastings and it is now my favorite band.  IT has the best guitar i have ever heard.
0446608955|5.0|Once again Sparks makes us look inside ourselves to find the strength and courage that is buried. He shows us that unconditional love is possible between two people, no matter how old they are. If you have ever loved someone read this book and learn how the love you have for that one person can change your entire outlook on life.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Can anyone tell me what the name of the song (I think it's Pearl Jam) where he is in a car accident with his girlfriend and he holds her while she slips away?  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!<br />Please e-mail me! :)
B00000K0E5|5.0|This is the first of Pierce Brosnan's 007 films and his best so far.  Brosnan is the perfect Bond, he has the look, charm , and that tongue and cheek humor needed for any bond.  Its to bad he could'nt have done it sooner instead of Timothy Dalton.  The movie has a world record bunjee jump as an opening scene, and Tina Turners Title song gets you reved up for this action packed, well acted, and simply awsome movie.  The story brings you into the crubling Soviet Union and revisits the Cold War in a modern setting. I've been a Bond fan for a long time and this film is in my top 3 of ALL TIME! Goldeneye is pure Gold.
B00004ZB9D|1.0|A greatest hits collection from Lenny? Laughable! The only noteworthy tracks that Lenny's ever done was the work on 'Let love rule' (come to think of it, even that sounded rather contrived) and his collaboration with Vanessa Paradis - a French songstress whos destined to remain obscure to American audiences. Pity, because her album in English really showed off Lenny's skills as being a record producer and songwriter.<br />Here, however, with the horrendous coming-together of past and present Lenny work, what can one say except 'Ugh'? The new songs on this CD are easily the most vapid I've heard this year. I remember 'Are you gonna go my way' way back in the early 90s. It sounded too much of an effort even then, and it was as if Lenny really wanted to stand out and make himself sound different. Well, even Then Jerico sounded different, and look where they are now.<br />Exactly.<br />Lenny's cover of 'American Woman' (supposedly inspired by bimbette Heather Graham) is no great shakes. For all his vocal prowess, Lenny's studio work sounds tired, and at the end of the album you are weary and depressed, usually both. Even if you're a hardcore Lenny fan I would advise against this collection. Be satisfied with your album collection, and save your money for something else. Like the new Erykah Badu album perhaps.
0553573403|4.0|A lot of people have compared A Game of Thrones to Robert Jordan. Thankfully, its nothing like the Wheel of Time. Jordan's so-called 'epic' was filled wih haphazard adventures, whining and crudely drawn 2D characters, and more drudge. A Game of Thrones is nothing like it.<br />The book is supposed to be loosely based on The War of the ROses in England, twisted into a fantasy setting. There is some magic in the book, but one of my complaints is that its overshadowed by the political intrigues and conniving characters.<br />The book is 'realistic' in the sense that it is brutal. For this I had to take away one point; the world is too cynical, harsh and brutal. I'm not criticizing it for being realistic, because the real world isn't as bad as that. People who seriously believe we live in such a world must be very depressed or reading too much Catcher in the Rye. Some of the joie de vivre, as the French put it, is missing. Fantasy doesn't have to be exuberant or escapist but it should at least contain things like love, sorrow and beauty that exists but is hidden in our world. Unfortunately Martin goes too far and creates a world that's overly oppressive in its atmosphere.<br />However there's a lot to like about this book. Well-drawn politics and fleshed out characters populate this world, not whining old Rand Al'thor and Co. The book is also more than a little exciting. Pick it up and you won't be disappointed.
B00000JWV4|5.0|It's a great movie K C plays the part well  It's a &quot;Dream&quot; I wish I could fulfill!!!
0451191153|4.0|I am a 30 year old architect.  I read fountainhead for the juicy details of big time architecture.  Rand wrote a story that is both bigger than life and true to life.  She was a voracious researcher and a highly imaginative writer.  <br />Art imitates life in Fountainhead, in glorified fashion.  I can attest from personal experience that a career in architecture does indeed include elements such as school rivalries, office politics, insecurities, megalomania, long hours designing, critiques, skyscrapers, mansions, engineers, contractors, tradesmen, and wealthy clients.  <br />There is mediocrity in American architecture, and there was a modernistic movement in the early twentieth century.  Rand abridged it for her story.  The lives of her magnified characters are entangled in destiny.  This could never happen in real life, could it?<br />Many scenes are so confident and gritty I cannot forget them.  Also, her building descriptions are vivid and beautiful.<br />As you can tell, I needed some extra excitement in my 9 to 5.  I thank Rand for the greatest American story about architects that I know of.<br />Only, I wish she would have finished it.<br />I have a big problem with the last third of the book.  A misplaced dialectic of philosophy cuts into her ending.  The ending is missing something.  If only Rand would have kept her artistry and philosophy more separated.    <br />Thus, as is,  Fountainhead ultimately is not literature to me, but propaganda.  And every person should be wary of propaganda.  The message of this story is not universal.  It is a mistake for young readers to imitate Rand's protagonist.    <br />Roark is the most wooden hero.  He is a robot programmed to design masterpieces.  A puppet in a book, not to be confused with a real life fountainhead.<br />Instead of anthropormizing Roark, look for real life leaders who struggle and ultimately change our world.  I know I'm just a regular architect.  If I was a fountainhead, I would know it.  Don't be aplayer hater.
0312853238|5.0|I loved Ender's Game so much that I decided to teach it in my English class. This novel is all about triumph. It has a spirit that makes it stand above most of the science fiction to come out of the same period. Without knowing about the sequels, the book enjoys an epic feel that made me think of the original Dune series.
6302649943|5.0|I first saw IT in 6th grade at a church lock-in (LONG STORY) now I'm in 9th grade and I still have a hard time going in to the locker-room at school by myself... it is SO good! But don't watch it if you want to sleep at all!
0930289234|5.0|This is the one that started it all.  The comics community needed a book that would be an enjoyable comic, yet still raise questions that needed to be mulled over.<br />Watchmen was also one of the first comics to have no clean cut good guy.  The character who is arguably the hero has no ability to see things in any other terms but black and white.  Add to this a healthy dose of paranoia, and you have one of the most captivating characters in recent memory.<br />Watchmen is not for you if you are expecting a &quot;funny book&quot;, but if you are looking for a sophisticated story, with artistic devices to match, I would highly reccomend this book.
0062502182|5.0|I think this book is an inspiration to achieve in life,to make dreams come true. it's an impulse to those poeple that think that we can't do nothing. But it also have a good messageabout God that without his help we're nothing. Sometimes we have obstacles that we pased if we have courage and a goal to achive in our lifes, no matter what the pople around us say we can do anything we want if we ignored them. Because is a lot of people that listen to others and they don't realized thire personal legend. I think that we need to listend to uor hearts whether is to look for treasure or love. We all have the capacity to be someone in life.
B00004Y62T|1.0|This movie was about the dumbest thing I've sat thru in years. Keep your change!  The only good thing was the beautiful scenery. The story was boring and zzzzzzzz and ridiculous.

B000002E5J|1.0|Despite her whiny voice on every song Ojos Asi stands out<br />I think she is a bad imitation of Alanis.
B00003CWL6|5.0|this film is truly one of the finest i've ever seen...from the beginning, with it's almost ethereal feel, to the shocking finale, it kept me mesmerized. the screenplay and visuals are incredible, and you couldn't ask for better actors then kevin spacey and annette benning. the film won't be one that i can watch on a regular basis because of its disturbing nature, but that didn't stop me from immediately picking up the dvd.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|Not another Beatles collection! Why do they keep re-releasing Beatles Anthology/Collection etc? I would totally understand if they released new, never heard tracks, but the same old songs over and over? Only one thing comes to my mind when they release albums like this.....  DINERO (money). Anybody can put out anything by the Beatles and make major bucks. But I'm sure that the true Beatles fan would agree with me when I say save your money! If you are a Beatles fan, you already own these songs, if you don't own these songs, then you are not worthy of calling yourself a Beatles fan! Go buy the original albums (Vinyl preffered).
B00004Y7SF|4.0|I have to start off by mentioning that Christina tends to rely on vocal techniques by artists such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston.  Here is my review of each song on this Christmas album and my rating (based on 1-10).  I think the first track &quot;Christmas Time&quot; did not sound like a Christmas song becaue christina puts a rap part in this song (unlike a traditional ballad) and she makes it sound more of an R&amp;B flavor rather than a pure Christmas ballad.  It didnt' seem to intice the holiday season.  The vocalistics she used on this song were superb though. rating: 7  Track 2 &quot;This Year&quot; she tones it down a bit in vocality and the beat of this song is catchy!  She seems to make the song more 'christmas like' but she still focuses too much with impressing people.  It seems she used less emotion though. rating: 8 Track 3 is my favorite track because Christina does have a lot of emotion and very good vocal effects.  In one part of the song she tries to hit the hight notes like Mariah Carey.Rating 10 Track 4 sounds very good and reminds me a lot of the holiday rating 10 Track 5is really too long.  I thought the song was good when I thought it ended but it went on and seemed less as good rating 8 Track 6 O holy night is beautiful as well rating 10 Track 7 has a more R&amp;B flavor once again.  It's good still Rating: 9 Track 8 I think Christina should hold notes longer instead of variating it a lot like she quite often does.  That would make her song sound better.  Rating 7 Track 9 Is a beautiful rendition  Rating 10 Track 10 is sort of an 'interlude' it's fun to hear though. Rating 10 and Track 11 is the remix 2000 and it's very beautiful not to mention upbeat as well!  Rating 10   Overall, I think is very positive and in the spirit of Christmas although it could use more work in my opinion.  It's a great gift item for anyone or even for yourself. Fans of Christina Aguilera should definately buy it but non fans may have to think about that optionbefore putting money down.  The album ends on a great note though cause the last track is very beautiful and makes you feel like dancing.  Christina sounds very warm indeed.
B000000W5F|4.0|Really a surprising record from the &quot;post Some Girls&quot; Stones.  Reccommended
B000002NHN|4.0|Turning poems into a new experiences with her haunting vocals and dream like melodies.  An enjoyable album for those who are already aquainted with Loreena mcKennitt or even if you have never heard her music.  For lovers of enya, the secret of eden, and David Lanz.
B00004U8PA|2.0|Although I do think the songs are very good (please note this, Rocky Horror fans, before you start pelting me with rice, rotten tomatoes, dead fish etc) I think that the movie is just too weird.  All the actors were great, really throwing themselves into it, but I think the plot is ridiculous.  I mean, look at the ending!  Also you can't really feel for any of the characters because Janet and Brad are too dumb and goody-goody and everyone else is too weird.  Overall I'd rather watch something with a bit more plot and a bit less sensationalism.  It actually got (shock, horror) BORING after a while.  I mean, seen one pair of fishnet stockings, you seen'em all.
B0000256KE|5.0|Rather than writing about the wonderful music, since the other reviewers have done such a good job of it, I'll comment on the newly issued remasters of the Roxy Music and Bryan Ferry releases.  They are spectacular!  Each release sounds markedly better than any previous version, including the original vinyl pressings.  You will hear things on this record that you didn't know were in the grooves.  And the HDCD encoding is a special treat for those people with compatible CD players, though not required to hear the glories of one of the all-time great bands.
0553573403|5.0|This is the best fantasy I have read in many years and one of the best ever written in my opinion. Interesting, witty, intelligent, and exciting. This has it all. If you are bored with the same old fantasy crap...and you know what I mean (blah blah...something strange happens, learn of new powers, get chased by evil guys, escape, hide out in the inn, escape the attack at the inn...blah blah blah) and you can no longer stand all the eternal drawn out boring series, like The Wheel of Time (Lord help me), then read this, you should be impressed. If you are not, then there is no hope for you. Go buy Jordan's 9th book, you'll doubtless love it.
B00004XOWM|2.0|Well.....this CD could have been better and it could have been worse.  Some of the songs are tight some suck.  To me, this CD was played out before it was actually released.  I think I've heard &quot;Rollin'&quot; and &quot;My Generation&quot; about 100 times each.  I don't have a favorite song on this CD, but I can listen to whole thing.  Overall I was kinda disappointed because I had heard rumors that LB was going more back to their &quot;3 Dollar Bills Y'All&quot; roots which proved false.  I would like to see Fred and the boys really dig deep and come up with some classics like &quot;Counterfeit&quot; and &quot;Sour&quot;.  Fred needs to decide if he's a rapper or a rocker.  He's trying to hard to intergrate the two.
6303477259|5.0|I have the VCD and it is just incredible. Just buy it in any form possible.<br />SONY, when are you releasing the DVD, it's about time...<br />Today PS2 came out and some of my friends camped outside Best Buy. Let me tell you something, when they release PULSE on DVD, I will camp outside Best Buy.<br />If I'm not wrong, SONY were trying to release the DVD for last Christmas (1999). I even had a pre order, but it never came out. Instead they released only the Wall DVD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Can it really be 7 years and three albums since I began college and adopted \\"Creep\\" as my personal anthem of alienation? Forget Thom Yorke; that song was about ME, damnit-LOL! I heard it and projected my own angst and depression onto the lyrics.<br />However, I have to admit that, following the success of \\"Creep\\", I didn't pay much attention to Radiohead. \\"The Bends\\" came and went, and the only song I liked from that record was \\"High and Dry\\".<br />Then came 1997 and \\"Ok Computer\\". Rave reviews and the standout singles \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"No Surprises\\" piqued my curiosity, which finally got the better of me when I finally went out and bought the album. Upon first listen, I was far from impressed. Aside from the aforementioned singles, I liked \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" on the level that one likes any old radio single (i.e., it was catchy, and caused me to hit repeat on my CD player several times). But the rest of the album seemed, somehow, unreachable.<br />Fast forward a few months later, when I popped OKC into my CD player again, and listened to it from start to finish for the first time since I bought it. Where before, I found the jolting guitar at the start of \\"Airbag\\" disconcerting, I now took comfort in it. Suddenly, I was able to see the epic beauty of \\"Paranoid Android\\". \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" became more than just another radio song; I finally heard and understood the simultaneous tranquility and desperation in its lyrics (Yorke makes alien abduction sound like quite the sublime experience). \\"Exit (Music For A Film)\\" and \\"Let Down\\" proved exquisite in both their pain and their majesty. And, on \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Tourist\\" I found songs in which I could literally lose myself. Most importantly, I found a moment in each song that touched my soul (when Thom Yorke sings \\"it's going to be a glorious day\\" for the second time on \\"Lucky\\"; or when the chanting begins on \\"Paranoid Android\\"; or Yorke's sweet scream of \\"you'll know where you are\\" near the end of\\"Let Down\\"). Now, I understood what all that raving was about at the end of 1997, when critics tripped over themselves to praise this album as one of the decade's best. It would be another four or five listens before I could fully process the thematic content of the lyrics on the album. Once I did, the power of the album truly struck me. On OKC, Radiohead vocalize the anxieties we all share about living in this microwaved age, but are too scared or deadened to verbalize ourselves. Are we sacrificing our humanity at the altar of technological advancement? Radiohead seem to reach a pretty bleak conclusion on OKC, but, in the end, the album moved me so much that I bought \\"The Bends\\", an equally stunning gem. As with OKC, it took me a few listens to get into \\"The Bends\\", but the thing I've come to love about Radiohead's music is its very inaccessibility. It is NOT easy. It is (to employ an overused critical term) DIFFICULT.<br />But I'm finally starting to understand that Radiohead are worth it. Worth the hype. Worth the pretension (real or perceived). Worth a permanent place in any album collection. Worth more than just one listen. Worth the work it takes to fully comprehend their albums. Most of all, Radiohead are worth the hope that rock music can do more than entertain, and even move. Radiohead are proof that rock music can still challenge our comfortable existence (see \\"Fitter Happier\\"), question our most deeply held beliefs, and leave us thinking long after the last note has played.<br />I affectionately call \\"OK Computer\\" my learning album. I had to learn to love it, and I would not have had it any other way.
B00004ZB9D|5.0|Thank goodness Lenny Kravitz put out a greatest hits CD, although we all know that this is just one of many to come since he still has a lot of rock left in him. BUT, for those of us who can't afford to spend all of our hard earned dough, cheese, 'benjamins' (take your pick) collecting his body of work since the late 80s, this is the perfect retrospective.<br />Lenny has evolved throughout the years, and getting this CD is a great way to discover which sides of his musical expression you're into - since he's very much into what he's feeling at the time when he makes his music...I know I personally liked his early work a lot, but he won me back with the last album.<br />Especially if you're a casual fan, this is one of the best buys (in music period) that you'll come across in a long time. Definitely quality, with no filler. Good stuff...<br />Knyte (Trust Me)<br />My favorites? &quot;It Ain't Over Till It's Over&quot;, &quot;Always On The Run&quot; (so funky...), and &quot;I Belong To You&quot;...<br />Yeah!
B00004SCX6|1.0|This album has to be the WORST album I've ever heard. I bought this for my 8 year old sister and even she won't listen to it.  The songs are just carbon copies of the songs from &quot;Baby, One More Time&quot; and &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; wasn't all that good either.  The songs are your basic pop songs. No feeling, no soul, no energy what so ever.  Lyrically some of the songs are ok (I think Max Martin needs to take some time off and try to write something good) And of course Britney's voice does not help her out at all.  If she had a shread of talent it might've saved the album.  All of the Pop music anymore just sounds the same is getting old and I don't know too many people who want to listen to it anymore and I wish the Recording Industry would get a clue and quit force feeding this crap down our throats. I would've rated this album a -5 stars but seeing as though I can't do that  I have to give It 1 star even though it makes me sick to do so.  Do Not get this album because if you do it'll end up sitting somewhere collecting an inch and a half of dust.
B000001Y79|5.0|I've read some reviews on here and all the negative reviews are like &quot;Gwen has such an awful voice, she wants to be Madonna, she's not cool&quot;.  Well ya know what?  This is a BAND.  Not just one person.  The instrumentals behind the lyrics and singing are completely amazing.  I've had this CD since I was 9, I'm 14 now.  I've always loved it.  Gwen DOES have a good voice.  Some people don't like it because it's different, but she has vocal range, something that shows real talent.  But you have to remember that it's more than just Gwen, it's the whole band that should be included in your review.
B00004XONN|5.0|This cd is beyond greatness, the flowing mellodies, and wierd sounds all are woven together to create a unique sound that is so powerfull, that when humming the song just makes you want to start singing.  I had no idea that this cd would amount to so much, because I thought their last cd was very good, but this one just blew me away.
B000002GEV|5.0|Crime of the Century is an excellent pop album. It is extremely well produced-the sound quality is amazing. It does combine a unique combination of power chords, saxophone and keyboards. The interesting thing about listening to this CD(I'm old enough to have bought the vinyl when it first came out, unfortunately or fortunately} is how much similarity it has to Pink Floyd's The Wall. Both lament a childhood terrorized by abusive teachers and adults and many of the sound effects and lyrics are similar.But The Wall did come later didn't it, so you can't blame Supertramp. Now that I'm a 45 year old teacher it can sound a little whiny-but the music always sucks me in and before I know it I'm a depressed, angry college student again loving every note and getting a charge from an amazing album. Turn this one up and enjoy.
B00004XONN|5.0|This cd is the 4th release by Radiohead, and shows how Radiohead has evolved since OK Computer. Thom Yorke is an idol to me, I swear I have a shrine to him, well, not a shrine. Anyhow, his soft crooning voice is enough to give anyone sweet dreams as they are falling asleep. &quot;How to disappear completely&quot; is a song that embodies almost perfectly how I feel most the time. And the other songs are great too.  There are no words to say this. Listen to the album, love it, own it.
B00000064G|5.0|I was a bit reluctant to buy it but am very glad I did.  I heard his name and one song from the Practical Magic Soundtrack.  Definately a great cd to sit back and talk to a friend or watch the rain.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Yeah, I am probably not as apt to writing this because I have not yet seen the movie (Oklahoma is not the hippest town you've ever seen, and it will come to theaters for a duration of a week in a month or so if I'm lucky). However, the CD was fascinating. You know, I wrote a review for it in my town newspaper. If you want to see it go to Tulsaworld.com and search the archives for McPhail and click on the one that says &quot;BJork stars in her own soundtrack&quot; That is my thesis statement.
6301871952|5.0|.......Probably not, but it is certainly up there with the best, most of the originals return in this sequel.  Smalltown folk, Billy (Zach Galligan) and Kate(Phoebe Cates) move to Big Apple, the only thing is, the furry critter that started all the trouble in the first movie, Gizmo, also turns up.  And sooner than you can say ''gooey, sticky pods'' there are more little fuzzballs running about; and you know what happens when the rules(Don't feed them after mignight, etc)aren't followed: Scary, Green, GREMLINS!  This time they set about an office block in NY, and in the genetics dept., things go from bad to worse, with the Gremlins(now multiplied tenfold)DRINKING GENES, and taking on those genes' persona:eg. Brain Gremlin, Spider Gremlin.  The way that the Brain Gremlin is executed is surprisingly effective.  Great acting, and some brilliant comedic moments, ''Gremlins 2-The New Batch'' is a refreshing sequel, that is well worth a look.
6305627401|5.0|The best &quot;musical&quot; i ever saw :)
B000002N2Z|5.0|I've had this CD for a while but I had to write a review for it.If you don't like reading long reviews don't worry.If you don't have this CD go get it now!It's amazing how good these guys are.They are really talented and Chino has one of the best voices in &quot;real music&quot;
B000002UUX|5.0|Thrash at its best, thats about what Rust in Peace adds up to.  Musically, the album shines very brightly.  The opening track &quot;Holy Wars..' is thrash metal to the extreme.  Mustaine's rythmn work is amazing (though not as good as Hetfield's).  &quot;Hangar 18&quot; and &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; are my favorite songs.  They're awesome, plain and simple.  Actually the only weak song is &quot;Dawn Patrol.&quot;  Everything else rocks relentlessly.  My only complaint is the occasional cheesy lyric, but the endless riffs and drum work more than make up for this.  A must have for fans of heavy metal!
0062502182|5.0|I really liked the book, it was very interesting, it's an excelent book and it gave me this message about life.     The Alchemist book taught me that if we want something or have a dream we could do everything that we want. Sometimes we need to make decisions of the things we like more and sometimes it is hard to decide, but we need to take the challenges and confront all the problems that could happen. We need to do the impossible to realize our true dream.     Sometimes we find things that take us far from our goal but we need to have the courage to do things that seem impossible for us to achieve, because when we think that we are near our goal things appear to destruct us and we feel like trash.If we persist to achieve a goal or a dream we need to make an effort or sacrifice to realize our dream.     What I learned in this book is that we could achieve anything we want as long as we are alive and we have God's blessing.

6305426651|1.0|To make a such a movie about the Holocaust would require an extraordinary actor, who could convey the contradictory desire to  spare his son and simultaneously feel the horror of being shipped to a camp.  Instead, all I saw was him literally trying to make a big joke out the experience, I think because Benigni isn't capable of portraying fear while being a clown.  Especially awful was the &quot;funny interpretator&quot; shtick for the Nazis.  It was just so icky to me.  I was shocked that he won Best Actor, though of course that is consistent with the travesty of the Oscars.  It wasn't a true story, but at the end the boy claims &quot;This is the story of my life&quot; as if this were true life story.  It was a cheap trick.  Very dishonest.
6305776326|4.0|I thought this movie was as stupid as it was hilarious - and I am usually a fan of high-brow drama.  Some of the reviewers complain that the movie is just a SNL skit on sterois and they were tired of its brand of humor.  Well, I have no doubt it's just a full-blown version of a SNL skit but since I haven't watched SNL regularly for quite a while, I actually found the humor quite hilarious.  I am not going to pretend it's got great artistic merits, but it gets 4 stars for mindless entertainment value.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Why is ATDI being subjected to the \\"Next Big Thing\\" tag? Becuase they friggin' deserve it, as the album testifies. This is an incredible, intense post-hardcore album from beginning to end, possibly the best of the genre to be released in recent memory. ATDI seem to be taking some cues from their recent tour buddies, and have tempered their Nation of Ulysses meets the MC5 spazz rock with a bit of Rage Against the Machine mentality ... and it works beautifully. You want proof? Just check out \\"Invalid Litter Dept.\\", \\"Enfilade\\", or my personal favorite, \\"Rolodex Propoganda\\". That last one features Iggy Pop in a guest vocal spot sounding better than he has on his own in years. Hearing him and Cedric trading spastic vocals on this track is the coolest pairing of old and new school punk rock I've ever heard ... and the most invigorating. Basically, imagine a smarter, cooler, better Rage Against the Machine, and you have ATDI. Highly recommended.
B00004ZEQX|4.0|Thank you Fulci again for another great movie. Truely one of the best.
B00004XONN|3.0|OK Computer was a masterpiece.  I don't think I ever have used that word to describe an album... so it's not a trite label that giddily I toss about.  But Kid A?  sheesh!  what happened to these guys?  My biggest problem with this album is that I do NOT need Radiohead to introduce me to Aphex Twin's ambient techno or Charles Mingus's orchestrated jazz.  If I want to listen to Mingus or Aphex Twin, I will listen to them.  I find ambient techno boring and inhuman, and I find Mingus trashily noisy -- while at the same time I truly enjoy Joe Henderson's &quot;State of the Tenor.&quot;  So maybe my problem is that I don't like the radio to which Messrs Yorke, Greenwood, et al. have been keeping their heads attached... but I don't think so.<br />Unfortunately, when Radiohead released their incredible, nothing-like-any-other album OK Computer, they burned in my brain an indelible mark that said &quot;vanguard of creativity&quot; -- and now here they come with this copycat album that is anything but creative, much less being in the vanguard of creativity.  Because of the beauty of two songs (How to Disappear Completely; Morning Bell) and the amazing ennui of Thom Yorke's voice, I give this album 3 stars.  But 3 stars is a failing grade for the same band that produced OK Computer.<br />I hear that Radiohead has a _rock_ album coming out in the Spring of 2001.  I can't wait for that one.  The morass of technodrivel known as Kid A is a forgettable thing.  Nice background music for the office, but it doesn't command my emotive and sensory attention like OK Computer.<br />Back to the drawing board, guys... PLEASE!
6305750750|5.0|This movie is truely amazing.  It got bad reviews but this is only the beginning, the first 1/6 of a 12 hour saga!  The effects were absolutely breath-taking and the story was awesome, add that to the amazing lightsabre duel at the end and you've got a very special movie.  <br />P.S. - To all of you who hated TPM:<br />Lucus will redeem himself.
B00004XONN|3.0|Another late-creeping thought.  Many reviewers are straining to find depth of meaning (both sonic and artistic) and are comparing this album to minimalism.  I wish someone would explain to this VERY well-read and well-learned person just where on this disc of background music are the indicia of true depth?  Straining to find bleeding-edge artistic provocation in this middling album is like trying to justify a PhD's jargon-laden thesis... you reach for reasons based upon the author, and not upon the work itself.<br />Please, gentlemen of Radiohead, I beg of you -- leave the synthesizers and soundscapers in Brian Eno's studio, and get back to making HUMAN music.
0380725398|2.0|An account of the dark reality of life and human nature. A grim way of life in crime, murder, and abuses. The characters are caught in the horrid crimes of the times. Of smuggling, luring and purposely wrecking ships, murdering passengers and crew, and retrieving the contraband for a wide spread and voracious black market. The story takes place on the English Coast, in the 18th century, when this was a regular and almost accepted practice back then. Those who profitted from the greed and the darkness' of the crimes, were people from high standing in thier communities, to the lowest riff raff of society. While I value the book as a source of awareness, and for a good history lesson, of this time in history, I found it dark, sinister and depressing. Maybe that was the whole point to the book. The heroine Mary, was even hard for me to like very much. She did show some strength of character and high morals, surrounded by wholly immoral sinister and weak people. But she just seemed too naive, too simple, and too much the victim. I thought the book was predictable in the outcome and rather slow going, almost boring. I didn't like the message of this book for women. Maybe I am getting too critical or am just bored of reading night after night after night, I don't know. That is why I chose a Classic this time. There is just so much trash out there, I thought a good classic would be a safe bet. I should love this book for being a classic, shouldn't I?  Maybe I was expecting too much. Sometimes when I finish a book, as I am putting it down, I think to myself, \\"dumb\\" or \\"stupid\\" or \\"stupid ending\\" or \\"waste of time\\". I want to read books, that I don't want to end, that I can learn a little bit from, that are thought provoking and inspirational, and that I can't wait to turn the page because I want to find out what happens next, not because I can't wait to finish it. This book was almost in the latter category, for me. I am glad it was not long. I give it a guilty 2.5 stars. Isuppose expecting every book I read to be riveting is just too much to expect, I suppose good books are like good movies, far and few between.<br />Kathy Struewing
B00000J2KT|3.0|Kubrick is a ledgend, he is among the best film directors ever to grace Hollywood and Full Metal Jacket is a Testiment to that. I cannot express just how powerful this film really is, if you haven't seen it yet then my friend you have missed a true gem. I wish i could have given this DVD 5 stars, but to tell you the truth Warner Brothers DVD's stink and this DVD is true to that which is why i am giving it 3 Stars, This film is presented in 4:3 full screen, desipte the box back cover stating the film is in widescreen letterbox format, the transfer is poor and so is the sound equally, you might as well just buy the video. I am very dissapointed with WB they have not put any effort into their DVD's, if Kubrick knew about this he'd roll in his grave.
0062502182|5.0|You SHOULD read this book. It's EXCELLENT. AMAZING.  It's the best book that I ever read.<br />READ IT!!!
0553274503|4.0|Here is your review the way it will appear: <br />flowers for algernon Reviewer: Kathleen from Usa I found this book to be very interesting. I enjoyed reading it. I liked how the doctors gave Charly the chance to be at least at a normal intellegence level. Actually, because of the operation Charly became extremely smart, even smater than the doctors. I thought that was really cool. I didn't like that Charly's co-workers would critisize him and how Charly thought they were just being friendly and showing how good of friends they were. As i said before i liked this book. Although the reason i gave it a four instead of a five is because i sometimes lost interest and it was really hard to understand because of the way Charly was writting in the diary entry form. There were a few parts that were sad such as when algernon the mouse died which meant that soon charly was going to die also. So, overall i enjoyed reading this book and i intend to read other books written by Daniel Keyes.

0399146253|3.0|If Ms. Cornwell wasn't satisfied with Black Notice, she might have re-written it BEFORE it was published... because that's basically what The Last Precinct is:  a re-telling of the previous tale.  And some of the &quot;ah-ha&quot; insertions were less than believable.  While I still enjoy her writing style, Cornwell greatly frustrated this devoted reader with a rambling back and forth plotless plot and re-hashed details from the last two books.  And because of it's awkwardness, I could see the end coming from a mile away, which is something I count on Cornwell not to do.  C'mon Patricia, hatch some new ideas and let Kay get ON with it!
B00004YRQA|5.0|no, you CANNOT save ps2 games on a ps1 memory card. it even says this in the system instructions. before you rag on someone, know your facts. anyway.... once this thing is finally available, it should be nice
6305364648|5.0|Hilarious action packed thrill ride.  This movie has everything romance, action, comedy.  Most of the critics of this film say that it is either degrading to women and the terrorists are stereotypical.  I don't know what they're talking about but I wish everyone would quit calling everything stereotypical and degrading.  Is everyone really getting so uptight that they can't sit back and watch a good movie without out whining about it?  Can't wait for the sequel.
B000001DWG|5.0|I can't help wonder every time I listen to this album that could Pearl Jam ever had come into existence if Andy hadn't ODed... It is a bitter sweet feeling. This is one of those albums that grips you from the very first note of Shangrila. The guitar riffs are just breath taking and Andy's is on top of his game. Just takes you on that emotional roller coaster. My next fav track is Stargazer. The lyrics are wonderful and so is the composition.<br />I think all alternative/grunge listeners are ought to be thankful to this album coz without it we would not have Pearl Jam and Soungarden... to say the least.
B00003W8NM|5.0|If any DVD was produced on the same level as the Terminator 2 Ultimate Edition and the Toy Story 3-Disc box set, it is this DVD.  Fight Club is not only a VERY well produced DVD, but the supplemental material will keep you busy for LITERALLY hours.  You will finally have a reason to 'break in' that angle button on your remote.  As a story, Fight Club takes a more cerebral approach to ones thought processes.  Containing many cool effects, Fight Club may make the average movie viewer pop a few Excedrins while trying to figure out the point of the film.  While many may finish the movie in total confusion, mostly everyone will agree that Fight Club is a unique movie experience.  When I received the DVD package, I was instantly impressed with the graphic design of the outer package, the discs themselves and the booklet that is included.  Initially, this DVD comes off as a &quot;special edition&quot; rather then a simple &quot;movie release on DVD&quot;.  Whoever created the graphics on the cover and throughout the booklet has a very active imagination.  Disc one has the film, disc two has the supplemental material.  ** Pause the third FBI WARNING at the beginning of the disc....it is quite funny**  Disc one offers you your usual &quot;chapters&quot; choices with 'moving' scenes (like The Matrix), audio setup for Dolby surround for both a 2 speaker setups and 5.1 setups in English and Spanish.  This is also a THX certified DVD, so it includes a THX setup screen.  Disc one also gives you the choice of several audio commentaries to listen to throughout the film, including David Fincher, Bradd Pitt, Ed Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, the novelist and the screenwriter, the Director of Photography, Visual Effects Supervisor and a couple of others.  In a nutshell, you have a choice to listen to A LOT of people, a great addition to this DVD.  Picture quality of Fight Club was incredible.  Overall, the picture is moody and dark with beautiful blacks and wonderful color detail.  Itis beautifully photographed with incredible shadow detail and crystal clear highlights.  Sound quality was equally impressive.  Being THX certified, you can expect nothing less then awesome.  Edward Nortons voice-over sounds very live, as though he's sitting right in front of you.  The sound has beautiful detail, with stereo separation being impressively realistic and the music and dialogue recorded incredibly well.  Surround detail is amazing with some scenes having deep bass that will make the neighbors call the cops.  Disc two will stay in your DVD player for a long time.  The supplemental material includes crew and cast information. behind the scenes of the production, the visual effects and on-location footage  with commentaires and multiple angles.......WOW!  Disc two also contains seven deleted scenes as well as trailers, TV spots, music videos, an interview with Edward Norton and a bunch of storyboards, visual effects stills, paintings and many other additions to keep your fingers happy on that remote.  The Producers of this DVD should be applauded....not only is the picture and sound quality top-notch, but the graphical elements and the supplemental materials included are fantastic and incredibly entertaining.  I highly recommend this DVD for those who enjoyed this movie in the theatre, who are curious about the film, or those simply interested in seeing what a superb DVD release is all about.  Enjoy!
6305807086|2.0|Everyone raved about this movie so I had high expectations. But they were left unmet. There were moments of brilliance in this film and also moments of pure stupidity. The real John Malkovich is a good sport for going along with this one. Save if for a Saturday night, &quot;let's have few beers&quot; kind of night. Don't see it straight. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
6305807086|5.0|This movie was like a &quot;real-life&quot; description of my dreams. The plot was so imaginative. If you want to expand your mind and be entranced by an incredibly creative movie, check it out.
B00003CWL6|5.0|You may not like themes in this movie. You may not like the actions these characters chose. But the fact that this film arouses such emotion makes it very powerful one, indeed. In spite of what the content of the movie is, I challenge anyone to criticize the cinematic beauty of this film. It's rich colors, it's black and white scenes...The colors supported and enhanced the emotions and actions in a brilliant manner. This film is important. It makes statements about us- as a society- that take us out of our confort zone. It's not trash. It's real life in this day and age. And it ain't pretty. Kids are doing drugs. Parents are abusing their children. Homophobia exists as does pedophilia, infidelity, and middle age crises...It's an &quot;in your face&quot;  film but it's done with such beauty and sensitivity- you can endure it. Spacey and Benning gave outstanding performances. All of the actors/actresses were &quot;beautiful&quot; physically. There are so many ways &quot;American Beauty&quot; as a title can be interpreted...Is the Beauty Mena Suvari? Is it the film itself? Is it a sarcastic statement about our lives in America these days? Decide for yourself. This film is too controversial to miss. And if you really hated it, I don't think you want to get this deep with your entertainment. But for those of us who love to study other human beings, this movie was chock full of complex and fascinating characters.
0064471837|5.0|This book is not just for young adults! I picked it up because the cover looked interesting. It follows Sabriel, a girl coming to age who has to learn to deal and accept her heritage and the powers that come with it. The plot is strong with enough on the edge surprises that make the book hard to put down. I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This was an amazing movie. I watched it once and then immediately bought it. I have watched it several times subsequently and have caught something new each time. The other reviewers of this film have done a fine job of telling you what this movie is about. So I'll just say to this you- this film is a MUST SEE (for men and women). Don't let the trailers and the title scare you. This movie is not at all what you think it is. Pitt and Norton were fabulous. And the ending is just unreal. See it. Buy it. Tell your friends about it.
0679879269|5.0|After all the build-up, all the set-backs, and all the hype, it seemed inevitable that this book would be astonishing, and snugly written. True to his style, Phillip Pullman created a masterpiece, that I couldn't bear to put down. Through the passion, the heartbreaking love, and the strange conclusion, all questions are answered in a way that is so twisted and wrought with discription and a strange way of interpreting the Bible, that it left me thinking. For at least a day, I pondered the mysteries, revelling in the wonderful insight of Pullman to have created such a masterpiece.      Even if you don't like to read, I highly recomend this book. I absolutely loved it!
6301972139|5.0|Extremely moving film, the kind hollywood rarely makes anymore. If you like smart but very accessible, emotionally engaging tear-jerkers, this will beocme one of your all time favorites, guaranteed. It's about falling in love and losing the one you love. It's also about a man who was maimed and misunderstood in every way all his life, but in the end he succeeded.
B00000J9HF|5.0|Another wonderful recording from DG, with Domingo and Cappuccilli in their absolute primes. Both sing beautifully, although I agree with the previous reviewer that Domingo is rather too heavy for the Duke. Nevertheless he more than makes up for it with his smoothly taken high notes. Cappuccilli is marvelous in this recording, one of his best and his must be considered the definitive Rigoletto performance. Expressively dark, heavy, he brings the tormented jester to life very movingly. However, the highlights must be Cortrubas and Carlo Maria Giulini's conducting. Cortrubas, whilst not hitting Sutherland's high notes in the Bonynge recording, sings beautifully, and ranks with Sutherland as second only to Callas in the role of Gilda. The only problem is that her smaller voice is sometimes masked the huge ones of Cappuccilli and Domingo around her. Giulini is the star of the show, it is impossible to describe his brilliance. This recording and an earlier one of Macbeth (also for DG) show him at his absolute Verdian best. The way he enters so thoroughly into the spirit of the score is astounding. Buy this, if only to hear the great maestro at his absolute best.
052594527X|5.0|This was a facinating weave of a story around a famous painting, a look in a possible life of a 17th century maid in a Delft household of the famous painter; Vermeer.<br />What I particularly liked was wandering around in the mind of a young woman, raised in the 17th century with her reflections and observations.  She dwelt not only on what she saw, but the significance of those events and views to her.  Especially poignant was her observations on her family home and neighborhood after she had dwelt for sometime in that of Vermeer household.<br />What was surprising was the significance and interpretations of some events based on 17th century thinking.<br />The story centers around the young woman; Griet who is portrayed as being the woman in Vermeer's famous painting; &quot;Girl with a Pearl earring&quot;.  This story shows her family background and the story behind why she has come to be a maid.  You see the story unfold as this Protestant girl ventures in to Papist corner to join her employer's household.  Her interactions with her Master, his wife and Mother as well as his children and other maid, come to show each's personality so clearly.<br />What is most hard to wrap your mind around is how few &quot;rights&quot; a poor person has compared to the wealthy in that day and age.  Griet's sense of position, though she was not subservient, was that blame traveled down the hill of status and had more to do with who you were than what you did.  Her perspective was not one of outrage as mine would be, but of acceptance and awareness of this disparity.  She often had to tread softly and react to events that she was to be blamed with, warily.  Innocence was not enough.<br />The story unfolds how she came to be in one of her Master's paintings and what is interesting is the reaction and concern for this by all the parties in the book.  You see the reaction in the 17th century of a woman displaying her hair, to the significance of earrings and facial expressions.  What was also interesting was her reaction and interest in Vermeer's paintings and the process of them.  I never realized any of this was part of the process.  I can only assume the writer did some research on how paintings were done in those times.<br />It makes for a facinating read.  It gives you an opportunity to step back in time.  It also makes you thankful to live in the 2000s.ons.   What was also interesting was her reaction and interest in Vermeer's paintings and the process of them.

B0000024Z7|5.0|Caravanserai is pure sweet groove all the way through the album. For a short time I dj'd overnights on a freeform rock station in central California and I played this album in its entirety one night--there's not many albums I'd do that with (even if it means skipping commercial breaks in the middle of the night!). The songs pretty much all blend together so it's best to sit still and focus on it with your first time listening to it. Once in a while I'll put it on low when I go to bed to hear as I go to sleep.  How can you get a better recommendation than that?

B00004W50Z|5.0|Expectations ran extraordinarily high for this the Band's third studio album. With the groundbreaking and highly influential Music From Big Pink debut, followed by the self titled second album, featuring Robbie Robertson's finest song writing to date, the Band found themselves in a no-win situation, in terms of competing with their own standards of excellence. The solution to their dilemma...bring on the super talented and versatile Todd Rundgren to produce, along with the skillful engineering genius of Glyn Johns. <br />With this team in place, the Band began work in their Woodstock studio, with hopes of catching lightening in a jar once more. Unfortunately, things didn't go according to plan and soon Rundgren was gone, as the Band endouvered to produce their own album. Robertson's song writing, although still rock soild was not on a par with eariler efforts. <br />In the end what you do get here is a beautiful, quaint, homespun feel. I love the mortal sells soul to demon, Daniel and the Sacred Harp. Employing perhaps the rarest arrangement of fiddle, accordian, mandolin, harmonica and string bass. Ala Glory and Sleeping stand tall along side Wispering Pines, (from the second album) as classic Appalachian style ballads. There's also no shortage of rollicking good humor with tunes like Time To Kill, Strawberry Wine and the ever infectious W. S. Walcott Medicine Show. The Band ultimately succeed with Stage Fright by blazing a new trail, taking risks but never abandoning their essential strengths of simplicity, honestey and vision.
6305810109|5.0|If you read the editorial review and the many customer reviews for this movie, all will tell you the same, &quot;great story, great acting, great directing - great movie.&quot;  By no means, do I disagree with anyone who feels this is a great movie.  But instead of writing about what everyone already knows, which is, that this is a wonderful film, I would like to point out the two unforgettable men of this film - Alvin Straight and Richard Farnsworth.  Alvin Straight gave us this story.  He gave us a story of courage, perseverance, wisdom, and forgiveness.  Alvin's story made me wish I knew him personally.  It made me wish I was one of those fortunate people that he met during his journey.  Richard Farnsworth gave us Alvin.  Again, everyone agreed that Richard Farnsworth's portrayal of Alvin was impeccable, and it truly was.  But to me, I do not believe that Mr. Farnsworth solely resorted to his acting abilities for this portrayal.  I believe he identified with Alvin's physical and emotional trials, since Mr. Farnsworth, himself, was suffering from a terminal illness. And like Alvin, Mr. Farnsworth forged on through the pain.  He gave a flawless performance and completed his last film.  In many ways, Mr. Farnsworth was giving us himself while he was giving us Alvin.  To sum it up, &quot;The Straight Story&quot; went straight to my heart, as it did with every person who witnessed this extraordinary film.
B000002JSJ|3.0|By 1976, Led Zeppelin was one of the most important hard rock bands in the world. Therefore, came the need to expend the horizons. Sadly, that does not work for me in this case. It seems to me that the band had lost its all - important groove. However, it's not all bad. Take a listen to &quot;For your life&quot; and &quot;Tea for two&quot;, to remind you that this great band could still come up with good hard rock blues songs.
B00004X01U|5.0|I'm a huge Madonna fan but even I have been surprised by how much I enjoy this CD.  <br />From the kicky songs at the beginning that make you wanna dance to the folksy tunes (LOVE Gone!) at the end that make you relax and become introspective, it is just great.<br />This one goes on my all time favorites pile...
B000002UY5|3.0|Really, I don't know what to say.... While I think Blind Melon is a good band that was certainly overlooked, their music don't really work in the long run. Both here {and on their second album, &quot;Soup&quot;} they have some good moments {see tracks such as: &quot;I wonder&quot;, &quot;No Rain&quot;, &quot;Sleepy House&quot;, &quot;Change&quot;, &quot;Seed to a tree&quot; and &quot;Drive&quot;}, where their mixure of The Greatful Dead, 1960s hard rock  and blues really works, but in the times it's not it can be really fairly not interesting.
0790732203|5.0|One of the best movies from the 80s...the soundtrack is terrific, the camerawork rocks...Just awesome.
6301247485|5.0|I had never read the book or seen the movie until today. After reading some of the other reviews I desperately needed to respond with my own. The Great Gatsby truly moved me. I was so captivated by the book and the movie. I saw the movie first and then read the book. I will have to disagree with any criticism about any of the cast performances in the movie. The only negative thing I can comment on is the monotonous charleston song playing what seemed to be over &amp; over again. This is undoubtedly intentional. Fitzgerald and/or Clayton make a statement that through all of the chaos, deceipt and disillusion there is music, glorious music. No matter what evil and horror happens in the world it is easy to masquerade it. Humans are oblivious and it is so easy to just hide from pain. Pop a pill, take a drink, listen to outrageous music. It is such a romantic movie. Not an ooey gooey icky romantic, a real life romantic. Gatsby is such a sorry, lovely character. Sorry because he was so full of life but so stupid. Lovely because he brings hope of true love. If only he had fallen in love with a more worthy woman. Then I guess it wouldn't be such a great book/film. For those of you who &quot;don't get&quot; this story, you haven't grown up yet. I am not old but I've lived. The Great Gatsby gave me more life to look forward to.
B00000J2KT|5.0|This movie is one of the best vietnam films ever made. Stanley Kubrick at his finest. Matthew Modine is brilliant, but ex drill seargent R. Lee Emry is the highlight of the film, using all of his own insults.  Funny, violent and thoughtful. A must in any collection.

0767802519|4.0|Now that the international cut of this film is available on DVD under the title &quot;Leon -- The Professional&quot;, with 24 minutes or more of additional footage, I highly recommend buying that one.  This is the American-released version of what turned out to be a great little movie, and in this case more footage is definitely better.<br />Portman and Reno are two fascinating characters and the relationship between them is half the fun.  Natalie Portman in her child-woman acting debut is appropriately fascinating and Jean Reno is at his best.  It's a fascinating story with a bit of Lolita, a bit of the mob, a healthy dose of well-handled action, and another interesting performance by Gary Oldman to boot.  Not to mention direction by one of my new favorites, Luc Besson (who later made THE FIFTH ELEMENT).<br />Buy this movie in confidence -- it is an enjoyable ride without the cliches and stereotypical plotting of other films in the same genre -- or buy &quot;Leon&quot;, the longer international cut also available on DVD, for an even more completely developed experience of this really, really nice movie.
B000002HNR|4.0|the doors sound great live.they sound as if it was a studio recording.it has songs that id never before.with the exception of break on through.it has 21 songs and most of them are performed in a medley.great cd to add to your collection.
0767802659|4.0|The creative team behind ROBOCOP, writer Ed Neumeier and director Paul Verhoeven (whose other credits include SOLDIER OF ORANGE, TOTAL RECALL and BASIC INSTINCT) have done an energetically ambitious job of turning Heinlein's story into a modern movie.  While it is usually a mistake to expect a movie to follow the book (take THE SHINING as an example), this movie manages to utilize the &quot;bug-war&quot; portion of Heinlein's story to do some really innovative things with computer animation.<br />The industry's current leading animator and inheritor of Harryhausen's mantle is Phil Tippett, who animated the robot ED209 in ROBOCOP, worked on JURASSIC PARK, and was in charge of the bug animation here.  The movie contains some truly spectacular and realistic &quot;cast of thousands&quot; bug vs. human battle scenes, and some fairly strong bug vs. human violence (though most violence is edited so fast that if you blink you'll miss it). The bugs themselves are tremendously realistic throughout.  The huge spaceships maneuvering about in the war scenes are equally impressive.  The DVD affords either widescreen letterbox or 16:9 anamorphic views of the action, by the way.<br />According to the filmmakers' commentary on this double-sided DVD, the most disgusting thing in this movie for many in the audience was Denise Richards' fickleness.  The fact that she throws over the hero for another boyfriend for most of the movie was apparently outrageous for some viewers.  In fact she comes off as smart and pragmatic, if a bit like the &quot;ice-princess-next-door.&quot;<br />I like the script, personally, and I particularly like the outstanding job done by Dina Meyer in portraying the &quot;Dizzy&quot; character. She is athletic, naturally beautiful, and says more with a look than many others can with dialog. Her appearance on the DVD in make-up only sharpens the contrast between her portrayal and her usual &quot;look&quot; -- quite an impressive lady.<br />The efforts to criticize fascism in the film fall flat, probably because the Nazi references appear without explicit comment, and viewers may legitimately feel ambivalent about their intent.  In fact I thought the long leather coats on the good guys were off-putting myself. Probably, the filmmakers took too much for granted in assuming we all believe &quot;gung ho&quot; patriotism is as reprehensible as they do.<br />Ed Neumeier is a friend of mine, and he tells me he intended the &quot;90210 in space&quot; tone of this movie.  Luckily, the young cast is talented enough to make this work mostly, and I can say with confidence that the $100 million budget is all up there on the screen.  The effects are as good as anything you'll see currently, and there are lots of them.  All in all, this is an impressive movie.  The 2-sided DVD contains a lot of extras -- commentary, documentary, trailer, extra scenes -- and I recommend this version for those interested in an enhanced experience.ze fascism in the film fall flat, probably because the Nazi references appear without explicit comment, and viewers may legitimately feel ambivalent about their intent.

B00000I9MK|5.0|This is what should be popular now, not what is being cranked out by record company moguls. Songs like The State I Am In and She's Losing It immediately captures the listener's ears. Drenched in melody and lyrically well-written would make people like Britney Spears and the guys in NSYNC jealous with envy, if they wrote their own songs that is and actually were aware of Belle and Sebastian. Tigermilk is how I envision how pop music should be, not Oops! I Did It Again or No Strings Attached.
B000001DYD|3.0|I have lived with this album for a number of years; I bought it when it came out.  The thing that bugs the everlasting hoo-hah out of me is the fact that Steve Albini made Polly Jean's vocals nearly inaudible, mixing them far below the rest of the band.  I don't know if this was deliberate on Albini's part; I wouldn't put that past him.  Any guy that names his band &quot;Rapeman&quot; probably has problems with women.  In any case, this would have been a great second album, if you didn't constantly have to jack the volume up and down.  You're either straining to hear it or you're turning it down; nothing in between.  That's annoying, but I don't blame it on PJ Harvey; I blame that on Steve Albini, the then-producer.  It would be nice if someone would remix this entire CD and re-release it.  Until then, keep your hand near the volume knob.  And it would be a pity if you didn't; this has as many strong songs as &quot;Dry&quot; did.  You just have to dig them out from under Albini's poor production skills.
B0000019HU|5.0|1991/1992 was certainly an incredible year for rock music.  Not only was their the mainstream success of Nirvana's Nevermind, but other albums such as My Bloody Valentine's Loveless, Pavement's Slanted and Enchanted, Sebadoh's Sebadoh III, Fugazi's early albums, and many other masterworks.  The one which has come to tower above all the others has to be Slint's Spiderland.  This is one of the few albums that makes me ache just to think about.  Though the lyrics are mumbled and near incomprehensible, the time signatures complex, it is probably the first ambient rock album.  It exists more as one continous piece of music, one last burning candle on a foggy night.  To hear Brian McMahan scream &quot;I MISS YOU&quot; on &quot;Good Morning, Captain&quot; is to hear longing and sadness at its most invigorating.  A must have.
B000002NBY|5.0|Paul Simon is no doubt one of the best songwriters of our time, and his album &quot;Graceland&quot; proves it. My father was influenced incredibly by the works of Simon and Garfunkle, and now I am influenced enormously by his works on &quot;Graceland&quot;. Listening to the songs on this album, I can't help but be moved every time by the emotion that has been put into the music. Paul not only started a new and exciting form of music on this album, he taught my generation to discover the works of a musical genius whose music has been living for four decades. The title song 'Graceland' takes you on a journey of love, and moving on from previous love. His use of African instruments and styles enhance the mood of the music, and show that all music is made for one reason; Speaking to our hearts. 'Boy in the bubble' is a song that reaches out to our hearts and tells us that the world is not ok. That there are things in the world that we should be thinking about, and that there are people a lot worse off than us. Combining the brilliant sounds of Paul Simon with the incredible sounds of African music, was perhaps the most brilliant idea created in the history of music! I gave this album five stars, because that was the most stars we are allowed to give. If there were ten stars, I still would have wanted to give eleven. &quot;Graceland&quot; changed my whole appreciation of music, and I think everyone should have that chance. Thankyou Paul.
B000003BEM|5.0|The Stones were truly one of the greatest rock bands to come out of the early '60's, the time when rock music took flight, and &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot; is one of their best pieces of work. After the psychedelic side-trip of &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot;, the single &quot;Jumpin' Jack Flash&quot;, followed by this LP, came as a great relief. It represented both a return to the band's R&amp;B roots and their first extension into country-based rock. It also showcased a new depth in Jagger's lyrics.<br />While &quot;Sympathy...&quot; and &quot;Street...&quot; have traditionally gotten all the airplay from this set, there are numerous other gems. &quot;Dear Doctor&quot;, &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; and &quot;Factory Girl&quot; display the country influence in both music and homey, working-man lyrics. &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; is a rock hymn to everyman. &quot;Parachute Woman&quot; is an R&amp;B-based rocker.<br />This is one of my ten favorite album/CDs of all-time. Nobody who likes rock music should be without it.
B00004XQP4|4.0|This album is obviously very different from Green Day's past efforts.  It appears as though the band is trying to prove themselves as genuine musicians and shatter their image as immature clowns.  But, if you look past the soft guitars and use of string and wind instruments, most of the songs are still very much Green Day with their simple but fun power chords.  A couple songs, on the other hand, are very different.  The very ethnic-sounding song &quot;Misery&quot; is a big gamble that pays off and is one of the best songs on the album.  It's a mature sound for an older band.  To the critic that said Green Day is &quot;supposed to be a punk band&quot;, I disagree.  Green Day is not SUPPOSED to be anything other than musicians.  So, if you have a limited musical taste, you won't like this album.  But, if you can appreciate good music of different styles.  Warning is a very good album.
B00004ZB9D|3.0|For an album of Lenny's greatest hits, this sure leaves off some of his greatest in favor of more mediocre tracks.  For example, where is &quot;Mama Said&quot; or &quot;Fields of Joy&quot;? Other key tracks missing from Lenny's amazing early years are &quot;Rosemary&quot; and &quot;Freedom Train.&quot;  Where's &quot;Magdalene&quot;? And does Lenny really believe his remake of American Woman was great?  A much better selection would have been his duet with Mick Jagger on a remake of Bill Withers' &quot;Use Me&quot; from Jagger's '94 Wandering Spirit album.  True Kravitz fans would be better served picking up the Let Love Rule and Mama Said albums.
0451526643|3.0|I quite liked this.  His style is meant to be savoured - it's rich and magical and dense in imagery. There is a lyric quality in his descriptions now - he has a fine ear for language, for stringing words and ideas together to present beautiful and innovative images. It especially comes out in his descriptions of New York in the first section, where, instead of giving you an exact idea of what buildings there are and which people are walking past in concrete terms, he recreates a vivid mood and atmosphere that is sparkling with life.<br />This is again about the rich and privileged, who have the double fortune of being beautiful and charismatic as well. Anthony Patch and Gloria Gilbert are quintessential Fitzgerald characters - the handsome and intelligent man who is undone by his weakness and apathy; the woman defined by her impossible beauty who is nevertheless childish and immature. It places them at the pinnacle of high society in 1920s New York, then charts the breakdown of their lives from a whirlwind of pointless pleasure and parties to poverty, alcoholism, despair and finally madness.<br />The romance between Anthony and Gloria is finely detailed once they are married, but appears superficial till then. No compelling reason is given for Gloria's change of heart; it's a bit strange to believe that such an avowedly selfish creature would love Anthony so much. There is no climax, but perhaps that was Fitzgerald's intention; that their existences would simply sputter to a pathetic and unprepossessing halt, and therein lies the tragedy.<br />One thing I find a bit iffy is how come Anthony managed fine all his life living as a gentleman of leisure who, surely, spent a lot; then fell apart once Gloria came along. Also, why exactly were they so bent on seeking pleasure at all costs? Fitzgerald speaks vaguely of finding an emptiness in their lives after they'd become accustomed to being married; and needing to fill that up with parties and invitations - but why? Werethey simply such weak individuals that they could not restrain themselves? That isn't quite a satisfactory answer.<br />The question is - could they have stopped this disaster from happening? Was it pre-determined or could they have turned things round for themselves? I think the answer would be yes. It seems impossible, reading about them in the first section, to imagine them in the state they were in by the book's ending; or vice versa. There were so many opportunities - Anthony getting jobs, becoming a war correspondent for instance; apologising to his grandfather, although that was tough; just plain bloody stopping the parties. But I think once Anthony became an adulterer, their fate was sealed. That was, in a way, his ultimate fall from grace; and it was a short way to disillusionment and alcoholism from there.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|Christina is good when she sings regular (unseasonal) pop songs.  She is tolerable when she sings in Spanish.  But when she gets a Christmas album out--she starts to get annoying.  Now...if people actually buy this album for the songs it is understandable...but if they buy it just because it is Christina, thats dumb.  She's so annoying and self-obsessed and all she talks about is herself and her &quot;Ecuadorian&quot; roots.  Anybody like this should not be supported.
B00003CX7L|5.0|The kids love this film because it's more good fun with Buzz and Woody.  I love this film because it has a surprisingly sophisticated storyline.  Woody's dilemma (full life vs. sterile immortality) is presented in a way that is touching without becoming maudlin.  Plus, all the in-jokes, movie spoofs, and eye-popping Pixar animation make it a hoot to watch!  Which all means that I usually end up sitting down and watching with the kids when they pop this one in the VCR.
0399146253|1.0|I was initially very taken with Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta books, and was a loyal follower.  However, the last 3 or so have continually gone downhill.  Black Notice was almost unreadable, and I would give it two stars at best.  Sometimes, authors have &quot;bad patches&quot; and pull out of it, but Cornwell has finally CRASHED with Last Precinct.  This book is full of self-absorbed pap, and has a &quot;plot&quot; that doesn't hang together.  Sadly, Cornwell doesn't seem to have anything more to say about Scarpetta that is worth our hard-earned bucks.  DON'T BUY THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU WANT TO PAY TO SEE CORNWELL CRASH AND BURN ... NOT A PRETTY SIGHT.<br />Patricia Cornwell should start afresh with a new series, characters and ideas.  If she can't do that, she should retire with the large pile of money she has already undoubtedly made on this series.  Authors should know when their &quot;muse&quot; is used up, and have the honesty to not continue trying to squeeze money out of loyal fans.  (Others may disagree, but Tom Clancy is a perfect example of this.)  GET A NEW SERIES, CORNWELL!

B000002KO3|5.0|I first became a Talking Heads fan in 1983, after listening to Speaking in Tongues.  I subsequently turned on to all the other Heads albums, but Remain in Light ended up being the very last TH album that I came to enjoy.  This is probably their most unusual and experimental album.  It's somewhat like Fear of Music, but has more than just a dabbling of African polyrhythms, which they utilized sparely on the previous two albums.<br />&quot;Once in a Lifetime,&quot; which became a minor hit and somewhat of a landmark track for Talking Heads, was first part of this release.  It was only after it was included on Stop Making Sense that this track really took off.  <br />David Byrne's lyrics are as crackpot and hilarious as ever, in places, but they are frequently more touching than on other TH albums.  Check out these lyrics from &quot;The Listening Wind&quot;--<br />&quot;Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away<br />Mojique waits for news in a quiet place<br />He feels the presence of the wind around him<br />He feels the power of the past behind him<br />He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him...on.&quot;<br />If you've become a Talking Heads fan but not bought this album, you're missing out.  Fans of typical 1980s pop music might find this album odd and bizarre (TH were no Human League or Culture Club).  <br />Talking Heads were amid a strange twist in their development, since subsequently they added many players and made a more popular twist with their next few albums.  If this album still sounds interesting, take the trip with them... you shouldn't be disappointed.<br />ken32
B00000BKDX|5.0|If you in any way like Iron Maiden and you don't own this then you should bow your head in shame!! It is that important to own this album! It was released after the first five albums - Iron Maiden, Killers, Number Of The Beast, Piece Of Mind and Powerslave. It kicks off with Aces High and it's just amazing from then on. Powerslave benefits from the live atmosphere, as do many of the others. Bruce's voice sounds amazing, much better than on the A Real Live Dead One<br />There are few tracks which fall behind the others - in my opinion Die With Your Boots On and Flight Of Icarus, both from the Piece Of Mind album, don't quite reach the standard of the others. There is no Where Eagles Dare, which is also off Piece Of Mind, or Prowler, and Wrathchild is the only song from the Killers album.<br />Still, all can be forgiven as it is impossible to fit so much cool stuff on one CD, or even a double for that matter. It is a shame that Maiden failed to keep up this standard. Sure, Somewhere In Time and 7th Son Of A 7th Son are as good as this, but No Prayer For The Dying and Fear Of The Dark only contained a small collection of tracks worthy enough to be branded as Iron Maiden classics. After Bruce left, 2 albums were done with Blaze Bayley, and both of them were crap. They kinda lost it after 7th Son (which is an amazing album) - and tried to bring back any Maiden glory left in them with Brave New World. Although, if I'm fair, they did kinda suceed there.<br />I suppose this has turned into a review of Iron Maiden generally (which I hope you find useful in finding out what cool stuff to buy) instead of Live After Death, so I'll get back to the point. If you're new to Iron Maiden then get this quickly. It may not contain any songs from the second half of Maiden's career, but most of that was not as good.
B000000W5B|4.0|Goat's Head Soup is really a very good album.  It's totally different than Exile on Mainstreet tho.  It was recorded during the winter and I think the music projects that.  As far as the mood goes, it's not like any other Stones record, but it's very unique.  I love the album.  Not as good as Exile or probably even Sticky Fingers but still very good.  Much softer than Exile, but still has great emotional quality.
B000002L68|5.0|I call Prince a &quot;beginner's guide to electronic music&quot;.  Electronic music can be very beautiful but it can also be very scary to a person raised on classic rock.  Prince melds uncountable genres - dance, funk, pop are the main ones, though.  Not only do I respect him for bringing electronic music to the mainstream but I also respect him for the chances he takes.  I respect anybody that takes chances but especially those that risk their reputation and popularity to do so.  Sure, &quot;Sign O' The Times&quot; is probably his most experimental/avant-garde work but this is probably his strongest material.  This album makes all of it's listeners feel dirty and great.  It's a very fun album with not one second of filler.  Sure, I was born over a year after the album was released but the novelty has not worn off in over 16 years since its release.  This is one of the few popular things that does not ().  A must in everybody's music library.
B00004Z459|4.0|This is definitely a cool, cutting edge CD.  Although not all the songs are as good as the one they play on the radio (one step closer) i think it's worth buying.  They do swear quite a bit so this CD is not for people not used to that.  I definitely liked their punk style, and though their lyrics were not totally profound. it is still is a CD worth buying.
0553573403|5.0|To tell the truth, I have only read the prologue, but it was great. It was well written and had a cool storyline. Lets just hope the rest of the story is just as good!
B0000024U8|5.0|With all due respect to Marc Greilsamer, I have to disagree.  After more than 30 years of listening to all that the &quot;main three&quot; (Bloomfield, Kooper,and Stills) have offered up, I believe this pivotal recording is indeed some of the best of each.  <br />I recently saw Kooper perform here locally where he reiterated his contention that Bloomfield's best has yet to have been caputured in a single recording.  But, he pointed to this album as one that came very close to it.  After having seen Bloomfield perform in various settings and venues over the years, I'd have to agree.  That being said,I can't accept a statement that it's &quot;hopelessly mired in 1968.&quot;  <br />As testament to this, you wouldn't believe the number of times in recent years that I've played this CD (often to younger listeners)only to have someone totally unfamiliar with it sit up and say &quot;Wow, who IS that?  They're GREAT!&quot;  The music stands up.<br />FYI to Fans:  According to Kooper, there will be a 2 CD set of his music released domestically next Spring.  Around the same time, the recently recovered &quot;lost tapes&quot; of the Fillmore East live sessions (those from which the &quot;Live Adventures..&quot; album was taken)will be released on a 2 CD compilation.  Kooper claims that these are even better than the original &quot;Live Adventures..&quot; stuff!
B00004Y7SF|2.0|I was so excited when I heard Christina Aguilera was releasing a Christmas CD!  I own her debut album, and I was impressed with her singing abilities, so I decided to try her Christmas CD.  I looked at the track listing on this site, where I purchased the CD, and it looked quite promising, so I purchased it.  <br />The disapointment began when I realized the tracks posted do not match up to those on the actual CD (for example, I was expecting &quot;Silent Night,&quot; because it was listed on the website, but somehow is not on the CD itself.)<br />  I decided to listen to it anyway, and was shocked to hear how much pop was incorperated into the traditional Christmas carols!  As a teenager, I do like pop in certain contexts, but Christmas carols such as &quot;Hark the Herald Angels Sing&quot; are not not, in my opinion, an appropriate context.  I believe this could have been a much better CD, given Ms. Aguilera's obvious talent, and it was a sore disappointment to me. <br />My advice: save your money.  It's not worth it.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Why is it that the percentage of Limp Bizkit fans I've talked to think that they have found some rebellious alternative to bubblegum pop like Britney Spears simply because Bizkit uses guitars and cuss words to churn out () that is just as calculated as anything in the Britney Spears catalog?  Before you read any furthur and decide &quot;ur gonna beet my face in cuz i don't like kewl music&quot;, let me just say that I am 15 so I don't just have a negative opinion of Bizkit because they are &quot;new&quot;.  I hate Limp Bizkit because they present no new ideas to music and represent most of what is wrong with My Generation (nice pun, eh?).  This is not rebellion, this is a bunch of young men with minimal music talent in Tommy Hilfiger clothes.  Do any Bizkit fans even know who Johnny Rotten was?  That was a rebellious person.  Fred Durst is nothing more than a rock star, Brett Michaels reborn.  All of the songs are typical: hormone-pumping, testosterone-churning anthems for high school boys that are just so mad how much of a jerk their dad is.  All of the tracks sound rushed and heartless, like...maybe, just maybe, they were trying to cash in on their success by rushing out a new album every year?  No way, not these innovators.  It is also obvious that Durst puts no heart into his lyrics and writes lyrics that his audience can relate to, but not him...that's not art.  &quot;My Generation&quot;, enough said.  Fred Durst is like, what?, 28?  &quot;His generation&quot; could possibly be the fathers of the generation he is singing to.  One last thing, if the title of this &quot;album&quot; is Fred Durst's idea of humor let me say this directly to him:  You are all joke and no laugh.  A great alternative to this waste of $15 - &quot;Never Mind the Bullocks...&quot; by the Sex Pistols, the true sound of rebellion and innovation.
B00004Z459|4.0|This new linkin park cd rulez, it is sort of a good mix between korn, limp bizkit, and blink 182. It is a totally good cd, i mean, who else can take, punk metal, and pop rock, mix it up, and come out with a good sound...linkin park.                               later
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|Recently, I thought I'd had an epiphany. In a conversation with a good friend, I came to the conclusion that there are two kinds of popular music fans: those who think Bjork is the greatest female artist of our time and those who think Madonna is the greatest female artist of our time. Consequently, when I learned that &quot;Customers who bought this title also bought: * Music ~ Madonna,&quot; I was more than a little surprised.<br />Let me explain. It isn't much of a stretch to suggest that Bjork and Madonna are two sides of the same coin, strong women with singular visions (and single names) who have, over the past few years, pushed their different flavors of Pop Music into the realm of Electronica, garnering critical acclaim and devoted fans. Somehow, working in the same genre with many of the same influences, these two have managed to create music at the opposite extremes of the spectrum. And, ironically, their latest efforts were released simultaneously. I got &quot;Selmasongs&quot; the day it was released, my good friend got &quot;Music&quot; (the Limited Edition, no less), and we both got into a heated argument defending our purchases to each other.<br />Here's the deal: &quot;Selmasongs&quot; has moments of brilliance, and the rest of it is still exceptional, somehow managing, in spite of its dramatic orchestral arrangements and &quot;found sound&quot; rhythm tracks, to feel grounded and uplifting without sounding pretentious. It's only flaw is in its fleeting nature; the music seems to come and go so quickly that the echoes of the &quot;Overture&quot; in the final track, &quot;New World,&quot; make it seem as if you've only heard a single song. Of course, it is short, correctly described as an EP (despite having the price tag of an LP), but it feels even shorter than its 32 minutes, 14 seconds. As flaws go, it's not as bad as including a lyric like &quot;Hey Mister Deejay, put a record on/I want to dance with my baby,&quot; and it shouldn't stop you from picking up this little masterpiece, but it is worth mentioning.
B000002868|5.0|One of the best fruits of the post electric Miles band. The level of group interaction and improvisation combined with unique electric/acoustic textures makes this a must-have for any serious jazz collection. This album opened areas of exploration that have remained practically unexploited to this day. Standout among the entire brilliant collection of compositions is Joe Zawinul's &quot;Orange Lady&quot; a soulful journey through sounds and emotions that are deeply familiar and strange at the same time. Music at its highest level!
B00004SCX6|4.0|Oops, she DID do it (recorded another album)again, but Britney didn't make her second album to sound too bad. She mixes your average teen pop (&quot;What U See is What U Get&quot;) with some r&amp;b (&quot;Don't Come Knockin' at my Door&quot;) and ends up with a pretty good combination. However, she is not able to succesfully pull off the classic rock hit &quot;I Can't Get No Satisfaction&quot;. But with songs like &quot;Stronger&quot; and the classic title track &quot;Oops!...I did it again&quot; make this album worth buying after all.
B00004XONN|5.0|It is my opinion that every Radiohead album is a concept album.  They are always very obscure, ambiguous themes but they all seem to have on after several listenings.  Here is my dissection of the albums:  &quot;OK Computer&quot; was about our evolution into what comedian Bill Hicks described as the &quot;third mall from the sun&quot; and the spiritual emptiness being a target audience brings about.  &quot;The Bends&quot; is an album I have the most trouble dissecting because I think the central theme is very small.  The material on The Bends is very strong but I think the message is distant.  I interpret the majority of the songs as being about love and escaping to fantasy worlds &quot;that do not so closely resemble hell&quot; as Lester Burnham put it in &quot;American Beauty&quot;.  I haven't listened to Pablo Honey a lot but I think it's mostly about self-loathing whereas their latest, Kid A, is about self-discovery.  Maybe brought on by puberty, a mid life crisis or just revelations, it's an album about coming in contact with yourself, to me.  At the age of 15, where I am coming to terms with myself and life, I find a lot of meaning in the lyrics.  Sure, the segues can drag a bit but almost every other track is a classic in the Radiohead catalog.  My only complaint is &quot;Motion Picture Soundtrack&quot;.  I heard a demo of this when it was circling around Napster a few months before the release.  The lyrics are fabulous, the music is beautiful but...THOM!  Tsk, tsk, tsk.  His voice sounds like he's 10 minutes from passing out.  If he had sung this in the more bombastic voice heard on tracks like &quot;Optimistic&quot; and &quot;Electioneering&quot;, it would probably be the strongest track on the album.  Oh well, even the White Album had flaws.
B00004Z459|5.0|This group is so tight there like blink 182 &amp; slipknot combined . There realy catchy songs like one step closer. and there hard but not to hard buy this cd especialy if your the party type. college dorms everywhere will be raving with this album.
B00003CWL6|5.0|This is an excellent film, don't miss it.  <br />However, if you own a Panasonic A-110 DVD player this film will NOT load.  I purchased the player about two years ago. This is the first problem I have ever had with a DVD and I have about 50 of them.<br />The sad thing is it works fine on my notebook PC, which only has a 14 inch screen and &quot;tinny&quot; speakers.<br />I don't expect this review to help those who want to know about the movie, I just want to provide information to consumers that the film may not work on older players.
0553106635|5.0|It's rare when a series of books can inspire such a wide range of reactions within a single volume, but this whole series has that ability.  Each book has moments of poignant tragedy and comic relief, lofty triumph and dark foreboding.  We care about these caracters, and though this is true High Fantasy, the characters and politics are very realistic and true.<br />This work is the best of the three so far, and that is high praise indeed.
B00004T9UF|4.0|When I first heart &quot;My Name Is&quot;, I immediately passed it off, I hated the song and him for making it.  I still hate that song but I'm glad I gave this white boy the chance he deserves.  I should've trusted Dr. Dre's judgement, as he has always been an excellent producer and has an amazing eye for talent.  A friend of mine left his &quot;Slim Shady LP&quot; at my house so I figured I might as well see what it's like.  I had to listen to it a few times before it set in, but when I did I was thorougly impressed.  Eminem has a decent rapping skill and none of his songs sound &quot;familiar&quot;.  So, I eagerly awaited his next release.  I was disappointed to see he released yet another annoying song to promote the album (&quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot;) but I still bought the album.  I would say it's no better or worse than his debut, which is pretty impressive by today's standards as it shows he doesn't suffer from that &quot;sophomore slump&quot; and it shows he has a lot of creative power yet to tap.  There has been a lot of controversy over his lyrics but, come on, he makes rap music - these subjects or language are not new to the genre.  I don't think he's homophobic either, he just knows how to sell a product.  Maybe I misinterpreted the line &quot;...why can't a man and another man elope?&quot; but that actually sounds like approval of homosexuality to me.  There is also a lot of cultural significance to his music.  He is [I think] the first white rapper to deal with honest things (the Beastie Boys are great but they rarely rap about anything more than parties and outer space).  Also, he comes from Detroit which doesn't really put him in the &quot;East-Coast Rap&quot; or &quot;West-Coast Rap&quot; and puts the fact that there are ghettos in other places than NYC and California into perspective.  Sure, he's not a genius but he's honest and can be lots of fun.  One of the strong forces on MTV that is not another embarrassing fad.
B00004XONN|1.0|I've loved Radiohead up to now. When I played this CD I couldn't believe I was listening to the same band. All the virtues for which I've loved them before -- fantastic melodies, Thom Yorke's aching and beautiful voice, the band's raw ensemble power -- are either gone or so muted as to be feather-light, as substantive as fog. &quot;How to Disappear Completely&quot; offers some slight glimmers of beauty, but most of the other tracks are just derivative, meandering, unpleasant suicide-soundtrack music. Too bad.
B00004XOWM|5.0|these people on here saying this is total garbage,are tripping hard.they just dont know a good cd when they hear it.this cd is very good,i honestly like it better than 3 dollar bill,go ahead and buy it,dont listen to these nay sayers.it will be worth your money
0399146253|3.0|Okay, I buy the new Cornwell without really paying attention to what it is about.  Most of the time I've been pleased.  This time, I am having a terrible time getting through the thing.  I checked out the other comments just now, and I agree with most of them.  I keep waiting for something exciting to happen, and I am still waiting.  I have tons of books waiting for me to have the time to read them and I am keeping them waiting for this?  Please bring back some excitement.  I am sure I could find a textbook that is more boring than this, but I hope I would be hardpressed to do so.<br />I hope the next Cornwell does not disappoint.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I will resist the temptation to make any of the cracks the title of this CD offers us.  I was fine with Britney Spears making her disposable garbage for the gullible, close-minded masses until she went too far - covering a Stones' song, and probably their best one at that.  Hearing &quot;(Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; covered with all the poppy bubblegum added is like listening to yourself slowly choke to death.  This track is such an insult to the ears it almost makes the rest of the 15 dollar piece of plastic sound good.  I can't even believe her producers and whatnot let her do this.  Imagine if Debbie Gibson had covered &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;!  Britney, please fade away just as quickly as any bad trend but do it without covering classic songs.
B000050FEN|3.0|Seven presents many questions, but offers few answers.  That in of itself is not bad.  Too many films present simple questions with even simpler answers, force feeding the plot to the audience, telegraphing every turn of the story, basically treating the viewer as if he were a child.  Seven presents the viewer with a disturbing premise: a serial killer that uses the seven deadly sins (sloth, pride, wrath, gluttony, greed, lust, and envy) to plot a deadly killing rampage in a grimy, urban city.  The idea in of itself is not new, such as Vincent Price's Dr. Phibes (sp) using the ten plagues as inspiration for his murders.  But the environment and the execution of the murders is so disheartening, so oppressive, that it leaves the viewer exhausted and horrified, even if the level of actual on-screen violence is about par for movies of the sort.<br />The protagonists are two police detectives, played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.  Mr. Freeman plays the storied role of the cop who is one week from retirement, the man who has seen it all and is just waiting to get away from the race when tragedy strikes, and he must go on the hunt one last time.  Mr. Pitt plays the maverick up-and-coming cop, the young man full of energy and hunger, the cop who has yet to be beaten down and ground out by the city that he serves.  Mr. Freeman, as usual, projects an air of intelligence and wisdom, a man who has seen the seven sins up close many times over.  Mr. Pitt also delivers a good performance, and the audience feel his emotions and his doubts.<br />Their adversary is played by Kevin Spacey (this is not a give-away: this movie is not a whodunit).  He is intense as the killer, a perfect choice for the role.  Mr. Spacey is an actor that can play deadly, intelligent people like few other actors in Hollywood.  We can believe his character has undergone all kinds of trials to prepare the killings.  When he faces his pursuers, there is definite doubt as to which side will prevail.<br />Nevertheless, the movie left me dissatisfied.  For one, the plot unravels as it moves along.  It seems that the writers had spent all their energy on the first 5 murders, and then ran out of steam.  It quickly becomes clear to the spectator and the cops that these murders have been meticulously planned and researched for at least a year, and probably more.  However, the later murders are almost haphazard in choice, seeming that the killer, who carefully plotted his victims got tired towards the end.<br />This incongruity takes away from the experience of watching the movie.  Further, the atmosphere of the movie is so dark, reinforced by shooting the movie in a colder light, towards grays and blues, showing a lot of rain, the rumble of trains, and darkness of tight city corridors and alleys, that it leaves the viewer reaching for the surface to break away from this sea of darkness.  Maybe the moviemakers did too good a job of crafting the mood.  The ending in particular is too dissonant, again, because of the way the murders simply loose their carefully planned nature.  This is a shame, because this movie has a great cast, excellent atmosphere (if too dark), and a good premise.
0679879269|1.0|After two previous books of towering imagination, Mr. Pullman finishes off the series with a thinly veiled diatribe against all things Christian. To add injury to insult, his writing grows increasingly sloppy as he beats the reader bloody with his point. OK, we get it. He isn't overly fond of Christianity. But that's no excuse for poor writing. Any character associated with the Church is a cardboard representation of greed, weakness, duplicity, etc. The character of Dr. Mary Malone grows more stale as Mr. Pullman takes ever increasing pains to depict her as saintly and virtuous for renouncing her faith. Will and Lyra become romanticized shadows of the complex characters presented before this third volume. I almost felt as if I had mistakenly picked up a teen romance novel. I do not object to Mr. Pullman opposing my particular world view. I do oppose his sacrificing a great story for the sake of a soapbox. If his sole intention for writing His Dark Materials was to make a case against Christianity, perhaps he should have written a piece of non-fiction. Then again, non-fiction probably wouldn't have sold as well...
B000008JUM|5.0|It's a challenge to find a cover album these days that lives up to the legend it's attempting to celebrate. &quot;Red Hot And Blue,&quot; the first out of the &quot;Red Hot&quot; series, is by far the best out of the series, and one of the best collections of cover tunes ever assembled.<br />Yes, it's a tribute to the late Cole Porter and his timeless classics, and yes, producers donated their royalties to AIDS charities.  But even putting the cause aside, this is an absolutely fabulous record.<br />Highlights include U2's alluring, almost eerie version of &quot;Night And Day,&quot; and a tear-jerker version of &quot;Everytime We Say Goodbye&quot; by Annie Lennox.<br />David Byrne of Talking Heads does a down-home version of &quot;Don't Fence Me In&quot; which is quite laugh-inducing, along with the scary duo of Debbie Harry and Iggy Pop giving their take on &quot;Well Did you Evah.&quot; <br />We could keep listing big names here - Sinead O Connor, Thompson Twins, Tom Waits - a wide spectrum of genre and style which serves up success.  <br />Others in the series have been hit-and-miss, but this record is a definite must.
0670880728|4.0|No, Bridget Jones is not a modern heroine of our times. On the contrary, she is this average woman with a terrible loving life, a nerve-racking job and yet a weight problem. She wants to achieve, unachievable goals; she needs to quit bad habits and start a new life but not even cigars and a dose of self-esteem, guidance books can help her. She is a loser but with a point of view. She makes her normal, boring life interesting to the readers and makes us believe that after all, we can do better than that. That is where her charm lies beneath.
B000000WJZ|5.0|From the opening guitar chords of Cherub Rock, this CD smokes all the way through.  Billy Corgan's voice drives home the emotion with the slower singles &quot;Today&quot; and &quot;Disarm&quot;.  Don't waste your time with Machina; this is classic Pumpkins music.
B00004Y7SF|1.0|In the spirit of POP singers exploiting Christmas, we now may add Christina Aguilera to this list.  Once again, she sacrifices great songs to play vocal gymnastics.  She ruins such great songs as &quot;Silent Night&quot; by running through the lyrics just to jump up and down her vocal chords.  This CD is not very good.  It is best to buy the old Christmas CD's like Nate King Cole or Hank Williams.  If you like Christmas songs being yelled into your ears, then this is the CD for you.  If you're not a fan of hers, then don't buy it cause you won't like it.  Christina should have left this CD in the bottle.  This CD is up there with other great popstars Christmas CD's like N Sync and 98 Degrees.  They just shouldn't make Holiday CD's.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park's aptly titled &quot;Hybrid Theroy&quot; is not your average rap rock album. Behind the crunching guitars and fiery beats lie carefully crafted riffs, ingenious samples,chaotic harmonies, and lyrical genius. On &quot;With You&quot; vocalist Chester Bevington moans &quot;Even though your close to me/ You're so distant/ And I can't bring you back&quot; . The album, produced by Don Gilmore (Good Charlotte, Eve 6), captures the intensity and humanity of Linkin Park's music. But will anyone notice? Yes, &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is commanding the airwaves, but will anyone see it for what it is? Linkin Park's music is more than a vent for agression. It's more human than that. It's a work of art.
0425170349|1.0|Over the years I have read numerous Clancy books, and I must say that I have enjoyed almost all of them, yet I have noticed that the quality has gone down-hill since Red October. So, when Rainbow Six came out, I decided to borrow it from the library rather than buy it. This proved to be a wise decision.<br />Firstly, the plot is utterly implauseable and could have been thought up by a ten year-old child, consisting as it does of back-to-back action sequences connected by a thin and highly improbable thread. Secondly, the characters lack any individuality, all sounding the same and falling into predictable cliches according to their nationality. No wonder so many people have been insulted. In my case, I was particularly annoyed by the portrayal of the IRA (or perhaps a break-away faction of the IRA, we are never told which organisation the terrorists actually belong to.) All the Irish characters are mere stereotypes, little more than Leapreachauns with AK-47s.<br />Furthermore, the author seems to have little grasp of the political reality of present-day Europe. Does he actually belive that Germany, or especially France, would agree to the setting up of a US-led swat-team and allow them free reign throughout Europe. Does he think that Austria, Switzerland and Spain (which has far more experience in dealing with terrorism than the US) would immediately come running to the USA for help when faced with a domestic terrorist incident. Dream on Tom, remember, you're writing thrillers, not fantasy.<br />My advice is - don't buy this book, spend your money on a novel written by somebody who has bothered to do his research and hired a competent editor.
B00003CXFG|4.0|Anyone who sees this movie for the first time should be warned that it's shot with a very unique style.  It's ... different. :)  That's the only thing I can think of to describe it.  Lots of quick cuts and shaky action at times.  Great visual effects, though.<br />Vin Diesel IS this movie.  During the first half of the movie I wasn't really getting into it (probably because of the weird directing style), but once it got darker, and he got more lines, it got very interesting.  He's definately one to watch.  (You can also see him in Saving Private Ryan.)
B000002HIK|5.0|This is a great album from RDJ, I think alot of the music on it could be used as video game music, for adventure games (Final Fantasy, Zelda), it sounds so good, it's like a composition.
6303481272|5.0|This film was fantastic. Filled with deciet and betrayal,Love and the super natural. The film blended together , Everything fell in its place. The dubbed was great, the actors did an awesome job. Its not everyday you get to watch such a well made film. The animation id have to say is very well done. Good details where put in. The music to me made it all the more exciting. The action sequences and storyline were excellent. This one, though, is filled with rape and gore. Not for the youger audiance of anime. Id say this is a must see. A high ranker.
6301247485|4.0|I have no idea why exactly half of the reviewers (including teachers and students) disliked this movie so much.   BUY THE MOVIE, and the book for that matter.  I am in a grade 9 class where we read this book.  I thought the book was AMAZING.  It was a little hard, (so many symbols and literary devices, so little time!), however, my teacher was really good at telling us how to anylise these things and how to understand them.  I loved the book! moving on...the movie was just as good! Well almost, the only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is because of Karen Black, boooo, no way, didn't like her as Myrtle Wilson.  She was way 2 Skinny for this role, myrltle was supposed to &quot;carry her suplus flesh ravishingly&quot;...not to be a stick figure!  Despite what others may say, I personally, liked ALL the casting, yes, even the casting of Bruce Dern as Tom.  Of course Mia Farrow made Daisy a ditz, but really Daisy was.  There isn't much more on that.  The sets were really great too, @ the valley of ashes where the Wilson's live, that sign for &quot;Dr. T.J. Ekelberg&quot; was done really really well.  You'll see what I mean!  When you read the book and then watch the movie.  But read the book first it will really help you understand more, the symbolism etc.  Firzgerald was really great w/ this one!!
B00004X0Q0|3.0|alright if you are fan of limp bizkit and other horrible bands like that you shouldnt get this if your expecting that sound. i think people who enjoy that garbage actually should listen to these guys just to get a dose something that is actually good. this isnt the best thing these guys have put out. the production has a lot to do with it. im sure atdi wants there music to sound good but i think they should stop getting carried away with sound effects and such. i think cedric should stop screaming. and put better thought into his lyrics instead of looking words in the thesaurus. seriously, it doesnt sound poetic anymore man. 1,2,3,4 and 10 are pretty much the only songs i like on this. god that iggy pop song is pretty horrible. i still think you can learn from your mistakes and these guys have the potential. what i think they should do is cut off the afros put on some levi's jeans and try to remember not to beat us over the head with this stuff and just let us listen.          you get what im sayin
B00004XQP4|3.0|This new album is very different from Green Day's previous ones. They seem to have adapted a love for acoustic guitar (and a softer sound) for this album. I'm not saying it's bad, in fact it is pretty good. My personal favorite songs are Minority and Jackass, but most of the other songs are great too. If you like Green Day, you might like this album. It depends on what kind of a fan you are. If you like songs like Reject, Having A Blast, Walking Contradiction and more of Green Day's heavier songs, the odds are you won't like this album. The drum fills aren't as fast, they use acoustic guitars (and other strange instrument ex: trumpet and a lot of harmonica) and the overall sound is much softer.
6303921248|5.0|This movie is true to the book, insightful, funny, entertaining, dramatic, suspenseful, and a million other wonderful descriptions.  Families can watch it together, couples, kids, everyone.  I bought this the day the last part was aired on tv.  I was addicted and now four years later, still watch it.  I recommend this to everyone!
B00001ZT6Z|4.0|This is one of Sabbath's most consistent albums.  The vocalist, Tony Martin, sounds a little like Dio, but if that and the keyboards don't bother you, I'd highly recommend it.  After the disappointment of The Eternal Idol, this album marks a quantum leap in songwriting and focus.  Every song is a winner, with Devil and Daughter my favorite track.  This album and Cross Purposes are the best and most consistent albums with lead vocalist Tony Martin.  Tony's guitar playing is diverse and very impressive.  The whole album stands up very well after 11 years.
0780622545|2.0|It appears that I am in the minority when it comes to DARK CITY because I was entirely underwhelmed.<br />I recall that Siskel and Ebert raved about this movie when it was first released (in fact, Ebert charitably compared DARK CITY to BLADE RUNNER and named the flik as his top pick for that year), but I won't echo their sentiments.<br />I agree with the ...review... style superseded substance, making this movie less a story than a showcase for special effects technology. If that's what you're looking for in your movies, then, by all means, don't miss DARK CITY. It was obviously made for F/X mavens and anyone who is into modern comic books. In fact, it looks like a comic book. Just think of Tim Burton's BATMAN movies or Warren Beatty's DICK TRACY. DARK CITY is full of computer-generated backdrops and pools of light surrounded by shadowy murk. However, if you're looking for great sci-fi story with respectable acting, you should probably just pop your copy of BLADE RUNNER in the VCR and give it another viewing. Among its many faults, DARK CITY, a pale pretender, lacks the organic lushness that made BLADE RUNNER cold, creepy and the best of its kind.<br />DARK CITY's biggest flaw is that it takes a too long to develop a emotional connection between the audience and the hero, John Murdoch. For easily the first 45 minutes, the audience is left hanging, watching the story unfold as more characters join the party, puzzling over the strange events, and waiting for the movie to give us some hint as to what's going on. Then, by the time the movie finally gets around to filling you in on the joke, it's only to find out that the punch line of DARK CITY is a variation on the theme thousands of college freshman, at one time or another, have probably imagined in a moment of what they thought was profundity:<br />What if we aren't really here? What if we're just the creations of the imagination of some crazy guy in a straitjacket, sitting in a padded cell somewhere??<br />Sure, I'll admit that idea was profound to me, too, when I first heard it as a young man, stoned on homegrown. But, at this point, it's just an overwrought kegger anecdote that doesn't do so much as raise an eyebrow among those who have read stories and watched movies that explored this theme much better.<br />The acting also left much to be desired. In one of the worst miscastings I've ever seen, Kiefer Sutherland affects an unbelievable limp and a ridiculous breathless stammer that might have worked on a man over twice his age. In him, though, it came off like Igor in James Whale's FRANKENSTEIN. I was embarrassed for him.<br />The Strangers (a/k/a scores of the emotionless alien clone character we've seen a bazillion times now) never gave me the shivers because they didn't do much other than stop clocks, rearrange furniture and make people fall asleep. Hell, I could say the same things about my ugly, old Aunt Judy.<br />I'm giving the film two stars for the two (not necessarily worthy) reasons I didn't stop watching it or throw a brick at the TV:<br />1. I was introduced to Rufus Sewell. Handsome, intense and as sexy as they come, he would have been enjoyable even with the sound off.<br />2. Proyas, Dobbs and Goyer (responsible for writing the screenplay) stopped just short of inducing instant nausea at the end of the film when Murdoch admonishes Mr. Book (or Mr. Hand or Mr. Quick or whatever the hell his name was) for mistakenly looking in the human mind for the soul. For a moment filled with dread, I was certain that Murdoch was going to point to his heart and say what Proyas and his team ultimately, mercifully left inferred: \\"You should have looked in our hearts.\\" Even the inference was sappy, but at least Murdoch didn't say the actual words. I think I would have vomited.<...
6301969294|1.0|The late Ayn Rand was the supreme proof of George Orwell's comment that only intellectuals can come up with certain ideas, because no ordinary person could be so stupid. This film, which is, quite simply, the most unintentionally funny movie I have ever seen,is valuable only because it shows clearly why so many people who ranted (her name really should have been Ayn Rant)about the (very real) horrors of Communism in the years after World War One eventually wound up snugly in the grasp of Herr Schicklgruber and his little elves. (And, yes, I know that Rand wasn't herself a Nazi; she just played one in print -- and here, on screen.) Cooper's architect is an embodiment of the way Hitler saw himself: a Promethean creator, rejected by the Establishment that didn't know a genius when it saw one.It's hard to know which of the film's many inanities is the choicest. The idea that a &quot;yellow&quot;(i.e.,tabloid)newspaper could get the masses of New York worked up into a riotous frenzy over -- ARCHITECTURAL STYLES????? The proposition that, even after years of getting high-profile commissions, Cooper is STILL helplessly at the mercy of unfeeling mediocrities, who can kill off his entire career with one press release? The notion that one can be put on trial for the crime of not following mass taste?(In AMERICA????? -- where the biggest problem has always been ESTABLISHING a tradition, not breaking free of one.)And, of course, like any good fascist, Miss Rand never concerns herself with corny old concepts like right and wrong. (&quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot;, doncha know.)Cooper actually DID commit the act of vandalism for which he is tried; yet his acquittal is treated like a triumph of justice(presumably because no one Miss Rand cared about happened to get caught in that explosion he set off).And the homosexual subtext of this film -in the relationship between Cooper and his former enemy the publisher-is nothing short of hilarious.(When the boys plan their around-the-world cruise together, you don't need to wait for the dialogue to tell you that Patricia Neal won't be coming along).Finally, what makes this whole enterprise even wackier is that Rand doesn't even have the consistency of her own idiocy. The idea that a man like Cooper - proud, rugged, the ultimate loner- would allow a no-talent rival, WITH HIS BLESSING, to take one of his most prized concepts and pass it off as his own makes utter nonsense of everything we have been shown up to that point.In sum, if you want to do justice to &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, invite over any Patrick Buchanan and David Duke supporters you may happen to know, put some bratwurst on the grill, pop this gem into the VCR, and have a ball.
B00000IAU3|5.0|When I heard &quot;Here With Me&quot; for the first time (I think on NBC's Later) I was amazed, then I heard Eminem's &quot;Stan&quot; on SNL a couple of weeks ago and I loved the parts where she sang, when I found out it was another one of her songs I had to get the CD. I'm glad I did, it's an amazing CD and she's an amazing singer. One of my favorite songs is &quot;Slide&quot;, it is awesome and I recommend it. I recommend this CD!
0767803434|1.0|One of the most important aspects of a movie like this is for the  film to make you actually care about the people who are held hostage.  This film failed miserably in this endevour.  If they'd killed everyone onboard, including Ford, I couldn't have cared less.  You may get the idea I didn't like this film... and you would be mistaken.  It's not that I didn't like it... <br />...it's that I DESPISED it.<br />Complete TRIPE, with final &quot;cliffhanging&quot; sequence that is so hilariously moronic it had me laughing uncontrollably.
B00000425R|5.0|There are many ways to enjoy the music on this CD.  As with many recordings from the Baroque era this one makes great wallpaper.  I find that hearing it while I do other things brightens my day without being intrusive.  Although ambient music is usually credited as a product of the twentieth century, I find that this music also creates a delightful ambience.  On the level of musical history, Arcangelo Corelli (1653-1713) is an interesting composer.  Handel and Locatelli are some of his more famous students.  The Brandenburg Concertos reveal that Bach also was influenced by his music.  Timothy A. Smith identifies Corelli as a &quot;critical link in the evolution of the Baroque concerto grosso and sonata formats.&quot;  He is credited as a master of the trio sonata which became the source of the Classical era symphonic form.   A pioneer of violin technique and originator of synchronized bowing in an orchestra, he was hailed as the greatest virtuoso of the violin in his time because of his technical mastery.  In modern vernacular, he was a &quot;Rock Star&quot;. Corelli's place in history makes this music interesting to me, knowing that he was held in high esteem by great composers.  This is not to suggest that the music is uninteresting.  I find that when I pay attention, I am amply rewarded.  C.#3 in C minor has an arresting beginning with sustained chords which remind me of some of Haydn's symphonies.  C.#10 in C major breaks with tradition as it contains five movements.  This may not seem scandalous to us three centuries removed, however, these types of details provoked prolonged and acrimonious dispute, according Christopher Hogwood who wrote the notes.  He writes that a notorious scandal erupted when, in one of Corelli's Opus 2 trios, it was suspected he had used consecutive fifths. Both the Preludio and Adagio are grand and the Allegro approaches a frenetic pace.  C#9 in F major introduces the Adagio with a lilting melody on a theorbo (lute).  All of the Concerti are great, even so, these are the ones I enjoy the most.  You may find others which you enjoy.  If you are interested in one of the greatest composers of the Baroque period or in music which is pleasent, this CD will be interesting to you.
B00003CXDG|2.0|Everyone was on the hype that Mi2 was coming out.  The good soundtrack kept people enthusiastic of the release of Mi2.  Everyone thought it would be THE BEST summer movie.  You're wrong!<br />The storyline is watered down.  It's about a virus that was engineered that is lethal enough to kill you in less than two days or some sort like that.  The storyline did get predictable and tries to be emotive, but just doesn't cause anything.  The movie is like a James Bond movie, Tom Cruise meets a hot girl and that's about it.  The movie tries to be shocking and wants you to predict what will happen next, but watching 20 minutes of the film, most people knew what was coming to them.  The movie tries to shock you with people having on masks of other people, then have artificial voices.  That act gets pretty lame.  It gets very tedious and monotonous after people do the mask 'n voice trick about five times.<br />The action sequences just aren't cut out compared to the other movies this summer, and the martial arts sequences are very dull.  One of Cruise's stuntmen do all the martial arts techniques, but still, they aren't very well choreographed, and very unrealistic.  A real martial artist wouldn't do the fanciest of moves that are just a waste of time (like going, do a rainbow side slash kick just to knock a gun out of one's hands) then all the other dumb attacks aren't cut for a real person.  If someone spent two seconds to do a back flip, the guy would just shoot you before you even get your feet up unless your attacks are direct!<br />The shooting scenes are also pretty lame.  It's like a move in, shoot security guards, then hide behind a wall then shoot than do one dive and shoot.  No, it doesn't compare to any other movie.<br />The sound f/x are fairly good and so are the f/x, but Mi2 took a perfectly good actor and director and made them look like crap!
B00003CXCK|2.0|Oh my, should someone dare say this is not a great film. Well its not. This film is too, I don't know, good and evil is too simplified. This movie looked too much like a movie.<br />I want to recommend another movie, that is lightyears above this one, its called Come and See. Spielberg ripped off this one big time. Come and See is more human, realistic, and horrifying than this overproduced drivel.
B00003CXE7|4.0|This movie is one of the summer's better movies because it has emotion all around (except the ending) and very good acting.  The movie starts off with a battle and then introduces the characters, which gets you on the edge of your seat in the very beginning.  Russell Crowe acts with power, as he would've made a good attorney, and the other actors didn't do that bad either and sound persuasive.<br />The storyline is pretty straight foward and a little simple, with a few extra twists.  This movie shows the violence of the Roman past time a bit too many, but causes expense.  The emotion is pretty strong, as you follow the characters along and you're always thinking, &quot;Watch your back, he'll chop your dam* head off!&quot;  A very few movies did that to me this summer.  Not only that, the actors fitted their roles perfectly.  Nobody else could play a better gladiator than Crowe, except maybe for Meg Ryan.  Although the movie shows a bit more blood than I intended for, the violence only ads to the horror of the profession of gladiators.  The music is good and the f/x are one of the best there ever was!  Other than a few storyline problems near the end, the ending is adequete, although not the best ending, it almost sheds a tear.
0393038912|1.0|Diamond labors hard to explain that geography explains all the differences in societies.  He's like someone arguing that a person's lifespan depends only on nutrition and then supports the premise with countless stories of people who ate well and lived a long life, and of people with bad nutrition who died young.  The presenter neglects any stories with factors like genetics, lifestyle, accidents, wars, or diseases.  In a likewise manner, Diamond gives us a myopic view of the importance of geography, plants, and animals in history.  He seems more intent on promoting a philosophy of historic racial equality than exploring all the facts.  Diamond seems to say that &quot;your ancestors are neither good or bad, but geography makes them so&quot;. <br />For example, he states that civilization flourishes in areas with broad East-West land masses which encourage sharing of plants and animals developed for the same clime.  Yet in the Americas the greatest civilizations, the Aztecs and Mayans, appeared near the narrowest point of the continent.  They built amazing structures, developed astonishing mathematics, and achieved literacy without sharing plants or animals in the same latitude with far flung neighbors. <br />He postulates that the sharing of ideas, plants, and animals within the Americas were difficult due to the geography of the Isthmus of Panama and the prairies in North America.  This does not ring true since the isthmus can be over come by a short boat trip and the continent was traversed Lewis and Clark (perhaps Montezuma just needed a scrappy Native American guide like Sacajawea). <br />Diamond dismisses politics, religion, culture, individuals, and timing. <br />For an example consider Cortez's victory over the Aztecs.  Cortez's victory was not assured.  Many elements had to be aligned for a few hundred Spaniards to overcome a mighty empire.  The odds were really in Montezuma's favor.  Even with horses, armor, and guns, the Aztecs were easily a match for Cortez.  The Spanish armor was superfluous. According to Keegan, they even shed their heavy armor in favor of the native quilt vests.  The firearms at that time were not quick to reload, so sheer numbers could have overwhelmed the Spanish.  The Aztecs lost because of politics, religion, and individuals.  <br />The brutal politics and religion of the Aztecs made their subjects hate them.  The Spanish were immediately supported with armies and food by the smaller nations like the Totonacs that hated the Aztecs for their cruelty.  The insatiable appetite of the Aztec gods for human sacrifices insured that Cortez found ready allies. <br />If either Montezuma or Cortez had been composed of slightly different temperaments the war could easily have gone the other way.  Had Montezuma been more decisive, he could have had Cortez killed at the coast.  Had Cortez not been so incredibly determined to take the country, he could have just returned to Spain with a load of the early gold presents sent to him. <br />History is determined by far more than geography, plants, and animals. Culture, religion, individuals, politics, and timing all play important roles.  My dear fellow readers, please *think* before blindly accepting Diamond's grossly incomplete view of history.
B000002IWQ|5.0|I'm from Ontario I've been followin Rush for over 12 years.Counterparts is the heaviest album they have ever done Songs like Animate,Stick it Out,Alien Shore and Cold fire is not the same band when they did LP's like Fly by Night and Caress of Steel.I have every Rush Album ever made and Counterparts is a true Classic so buy it.I would also Reccomend buying Roll the Bones first time I heard it I loved its a real soft sounding Album.All there Albums are worth buying Except 1 Presto its a bad LP.And if you want to hear great Drum beats listen to the song Tom Sawyer Neil Peart is the best Drummer in Rock n Roll History.
B00003W8NM|4.0|The movie itself is a rare masterpiece by one of America's most innovative young filmmakers, although many critics were too short-sighted to acknowledge this (a fact the DVD unabashedly reminds us of with several quotations printed on the booklet, in keeping with the movie's anarchic spirit). Everything about the movie is excellent: The innovative plot, the acting, the settings, the cool CGI special effects, the subliminal messages, the disparate interpretations on just what the movie's message was. This is one of those movies nobody is indifferent to: No matter how you feel about it in the end, you cannot say you were not moved by it. As for the DVD, its quality is first-rate, and I loved the bonus materials, but I have just one small gripe: Why make two discs when one two-sided disc would have worked fine? That's what kept me from giving it a full five-star rating.
B000002UAU|1.0|I don't see what is so great about this album it () big time a guy from my work told me to buy it he said it's amazing.I wasted my money one this junk piece.I would recomend buying The Velvet Underground/Nico now thats an amazing Album and a Great Band.I read in a magazine that Lou Reed hated this Beatles Album.I agree with him 100%.People out there dont buy this LP its a waste of money.And probably the worst album from 1967
B0000039QA|5.0|The Notorious B.I.G. is the greatest rapper ever. This is, along with Ready to Die, is amongst the greatest Hip Hop albums ever. Ready to Die showed us he can bang alone and with Life After Death, he shows his versatility mixing it with the best of Rap and R&amp;B. Unstoppable. People will be listening forever. An absolute classic and a legend himself. Hot Tracks on Disc 1 are: Hypnotize, Kick in the Door, Last Day, I Love the Dough, Mo Money Mo Problems. And on Disc 2 Hot Tracks are: Notorious Thugs, Going Back to Cali, Nasty Boy, Sky's the Limit, Long Kiss Goodnight and You're Nobody. Legendary, legendary stuff.
0792844890|5.0|This was Brooks' best work.  Not only is it hilarious, but Brooks' use of paridy humor is great.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh.
0679879269|5.0|I think that this book is really good, and I would recommend everyone to read it. I am really annoyed about the ending though, and I don't think he should have tried to avoid the happy ending by making up all of that stuff about can't live in different worlds and stupid stuff. Otherwise, I think it was a brilliant book to end a brilliant series.
044022425X|5.0|If the size of the books makes you apprenhensive or you would like to revist them, you might try the unabridged Books on Tape read by Davina Porter.  I looked at the size of the books and thought I don't have time to read that long a book, let alone all 6 of them, yet people were raving about how good they were.  I found the unabridged versions at the library and Davina Porter made them come to life with the English and Scottish accent.  I don't know of any books on tape that I have enjoyed more.  So far I have listened to the first four and am axniously awaiting &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot;.  If you have time to read them, they are great but the unabridged version on tape is outstanding.  You get so wrapped up in the story, you can't believe when you reach the end as you still want more.  Hopefully Amazon.com will be able to offer the unabridged versions sometime in the future as I notice all they offer now is the abridged.
6303367518|3.0|This is a very entertaining film, which I assure you will make you loose your nails. All the actors are swell, including Meryl streep and Kevin Bacon, but the one who really does the great job is young Joseph Mazzello as Roarke hartman. If you ask me, he's THE actor here, the only one I truly believed. The scenery is also beautiful. It's worth watching.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|A great action flick, filled with suspense and plenty of eye candy. While the film is somewhat lacking in terms of depth, this is the perfect movie to fill your desire for some fast-paced action. My only gripe is that in my edition of the DVD from Amazon, the sound cut out briefly 13 seconds into chapter 12 (or 1:03:16). This only lasted about a second, but was certainly noticable with the contant background hum.
B00003CWL6|5.0|These is one of the best movie made in 1999, and an impressive directorial debut of Sam Mendes.  For anyone who has not seen it, you should.. for people who loved the movie, I think this is one of the DVDs you should have in your shelf... to watch over and over.
B00000F14B|1.0|I loved the movie, but hated the DVD, because it didn't work on my player!  I tried 2 copies, neither one could be read.  I have a Panasonic player, it reads my other 50 DVD's, but not this one.  Be careful before you order this.
B00004LN16|4.0|Stiff Upper Lip is surprisingly good. The boys just keep on rocking and rocking with good music. The years don`t seem to slow them down and this album is proof of it. Stiff is a good collection of what AC/DC always has done - good ol` Rock n Roll. No ground breaking stuff here but nonetheless solid. Songs such as Stiff Upper Lip, hold me back, all screwed up and safe in New York city are very good. No future classics except maybe the title track but it`s ok because the overall album is very good. The songs are also excellent live. I think of all the live shows I have ever seen, AC/DC is the one where their songs sound the most as on their albums. So if you enjoy listening to AC/DC but you`re not sure of this album, don`t be afraid because you won`t be dissapointed. Rock On.
B000023X9W|4.0|&quot;Good to see you&quot; and your guitar again, Neil.  I only left out one star for your melancholy self-inspection (i.e., &quot;Daddy Went Walkin'&quot;) but a &quot;Distant Camera&quot; showed me a &quot;Silver &amp; Gold&quot; &quot;Red Sun&quot; that cut me through with a &quot;Razor Love&quot;.  For those who know Neil well this is some new stuff that will give you goose bumps it sounds so much like the old.  (The DVD Silver &amp; Gold is also fabulously for hardcore fans).  <br />Get to know Neil- everyone should.<br />Belladonna333
B000005IU2|5.0|It was new year's eve and I was in a punk bar in pittsburgh, PA when I first hear a song off this album on the jukebox.  It was Dirt.  I immediately got up and looked for who it was...the stooges. This is still my favorite and in my opinion the best stooges album.  Gritty hard rock and roll that extracts every last cell of hippidom from your body.  Dirt and Loose are the best.  The vocals are amazing and the way the album flies off into chaos in LA Blues at the end is perfect.  You've got noise, you've got punk, you've got the hardest rocknroll to date, you've got a sax, sleeze, drugs, pain, blood, murder.  Your head will crash down around your ears.
B00004Z459|5.0|It is hard to find a band out there that can resist mindless screaming and growling. Linkin Park manages to put out, what I think, the most innovative, and enjoyable albums since Incubus released Make Yourself. Park fused many different sounds to creat one outstanding album. I just can't say enough of how good it is. One of the very rare albums you can actually listen to all the way through. That just does not exist anymore now that all anyone wants is to have that ONE hit.
0140185232|4.0|Personally, I think that Mr. W. Sommerset Maugham wrote a very intersting novel. I can honestly say I have never read any other book like this. <br />In a way, Maughham combined this book as both a novel itself and a Dear Reader Letter. On several different occasions Maugham just breaks away from the novel itself, and  starts talking to his reader. This was one of the reasons why I liked this book, but also one of the reasons why I didn't like this book. I liked it because I have never read a novel like that before and it kind of gave me more insight on what Maugham was trying to say. Then again I didn't like this because it broke my attention away from the book sometimes. <br />I also didn't really understand some of the text of this book, and found myself looking through a dictionary in order to understand a word, and its not like i could just skip over the word, in most cases I had to know what the word meant to be able to move on in the novel.<br />All in all, I would say that i would recommend this book to someone else if they asked me about it. The last thing I want to say about this book is that if it doesn't nothing else for you it will definitly make you think, I know it made me think.
B0000047EC|5.0|Night. Far voices. Dogs. Cars in the dark. Your  room never was so little. And cold. Never mind, never mind, you are repeating to yourself. But it's not so. Something to sleep. After days and weeks. Without nightmares, please. Something of beautiful, this time. You remember that music, that cd. It was THE cd for both, she wanted always that. And also you, after. But you cannot remember the songs, only the first two. \\"Waltz for Ruth\\" , what nice beginning!, while the kisses. And \\"Our Spanish love song\\". It seems a complete love story, told by somebody which now is very quite. It's not easy remember, now. Her hands on your hair. And the others? The other songs? Only one is coming in your memory,  not, two, because you remember that Italian film. \\"Paradise\\"! It was so long, but the music...should not never end. Ok, listen. To help yourself to sleep. After centuries. To dream. Not to die, please. It plays. Wonderful, but...too? A dog cries, it want that all people hears him. Play. Never mind. There is always one another way. You can see yourself, without shame. Never mind. This music...so beautiful, it's possible to die. So beautiful, to live! Sleep, now. One voice is near, is for you. A circular melody . So simple. Trivial. A simple round of notes, always the same. Pat, Charlie, what are  you doing! Spiritual...A quit voice that tell you how much times a person must repeat \\"never mind, never mind\\". A quit voice, that tell you how far is the pain...the solitude...Again a round, please, for a sleep full a quiet dreams. Spiritual, the incredible shining of a simply thing. Sleep, this song cares of you. They know the reason, you believe, they can play this music without discover nothing. All is already found. But...you had forgotten this. Goodnight
0452282195|2.0|This book is well written, in that it gives an uncompromising portrait of a sad life of poverty, racism, and rape. But that's all. There is no hope here. None. Not a scrap. We might as well all give up. What good can this book do for anyone?
B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park is a hot new band who combines techno and metal wonderfully in their debut album hybrid theory. Their first hit single &quot;One Step Closer&quot; is a great example of their unique blend. The song &quot;Papercut&quot; even has a hip hop sound to it. If you like Papa Roach then you will definitely like Linkin Park.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Call it blasphemy, but I do -- the reason being that there are a couple songs on this otherwise amazing album that succumb to pop/alternative cliches, like &quot;Let Down&quot; and &quot;No Surprises&quot;.  These songs are rather boring and conventional in comparison to most of the others.  With that said, the remaining 4 stars are for an excellent rock record.  Ever read the book WHITE NOISE by Don DeLillo? Well OK COMPUTER is the perfect soundtrack to it -- an artful attack on western culture that walks the line between being bitter (&quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;) and satirical (&quot;The Tourist&quot;).  With the exception of those two songs, most of the others are very interesting listens, especially the multi-sectioned, schizophrenic &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; and the brooding, cathartic &quot;Climbing Up the Walls&quot;.  The use of synthesizers -- while not as well-incorporated as on Kid A -- compliments the music very nicely.  Comparisons to Pink Floyd are very apt, as this is definitely what one might call a &quot;concept album&quot;, with all the dramatic peaks and valleys that that description entails.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is nothing short of amazing, with lyrics that make you think (what a concept).  The landscapes that go along with the vocals are the crowning achievement of this CD, this is what Pink Floyd would have sounded like if they had played metal. these songs will sweep you off your feet and you won't hit the ground until the album is over and you realize what an experience it was.
B00004XONN|5.0|I am NOT rating it as a &quot;techno&quot; or &quot;electronica&quot; album, which it is NOT, because despite the addition of synthesizers/organ to their ensemble, Radiohead are still a rock band.  They are, however, a very experimental rock band, and that's what makes this album interesting.  What they are experimenting with here is the fusion of two essentially different languages -- rock and techno -- and in my opinion, it works really well.  All the elements of the former are there, but given the offbeat slant of the latter.  One word that describes the mood of this album is COLD.  it's melodic abstraction is alienating, much in the same way APHEX TWIN and AUTECHRE are.  There's little warmth radiating here -- with the exception of maybe &quot;Optimistic,&quot; which, unlike most of the reviews here, is not my favorite song.  That would be &quot;National Anthem,&quot; as the chaotic brass section at the end is very enthralling.  OK Computer was a very emotional album, with songs like &quot;Exit music (for a film)&quot; and &quot;climbing up the walls&quot; -- but this is emotional in a different, hollower way.  VERY interesting music, and it leaves me with a bit of hope for the future of pop indeed, as album is currently #3 in sales rating -- top that, britney spears!
B000002JOH|5.0|This is one of the best albums to come out of a metal band in years. The great guitar rifts by Dimebag and the fast paced drum smashing by Vinnie make this album a must for Metal fans! This is a direct change for the sound PanterA had on Cowboys From Hell, Phil sounds like there is less singing and more heavy screaming. This by far a favorite in my collection of metal cds.
B00003CX7L|5.0|I thought that the movie Toy Story 2 starring Tom Hanks and Tim Allen, was one of the best disney movies ever made. It completely by passed the original. Jessie the Cowgirl(voiced by Joan Cusack) made the movie more appealing, what with the song &quot; When She Loved Me&quot;,  by Sarah McLaghlin. This made the movie more heartwarming than ever before. Toy Story 2 is a must see movie!!!
0451167716|5.0|&quot;Behind every great fortune ther is a crime&quot;.  With these great words by Balzac, one of the greatest novels ever(certainly one of my favourites) begins.  The book begins by showing a few characters in terrible despair ranging from the abuse of their daughters to the problems of the husbands of the daughters.  To cure these problems they all decide to approach Don Vito Corleone(played by Marlon Brando in the movie): a rich, honourable, just Sicilian who is also the leader of the biggest crime organisation in New York.  Don Corleone is a great man, he helps the poor without placing a heavy burden upon them and is also a great family man(&quot;A man who is not a father to his children can never be a man&quot; says the Don at one point) but has a problem: He is growing old and when retirement comes who will take up the mantle?  The reins of a crime organisation aren't strictly hereditary but Vito being the family man that he is would prefer it to be.    He has three sons: Santino Corleone, his eldest and the one with a fiery temperament, his temper being so bad that he is unable to even think while having a tantrum.  No, he is ruled out.  The second one, Fredo, is a very dutiful, obedient but also a very emotional man and not ruthless enough.  He also is ruled out.  Then there is the third one, Michael(played by Al Pacino in the movie(s)) would have been the perfect choice except that he has made it clear he has no interest in the family business and loaths it.  If not him then who?  That is the question troubling Vito.     Throughout the book, the question gets answered for him when he gets shot.  The reason being that he refuses to take part in a drugs deal but Santino shows interest in the deal, the drugs dealer, a clever man named Solozzo, knows that if he removes the Don, Santino(nicknamed Sonny) will take the chair and will agree to the deal and so Solozzo sets out to kill the Don, but only injures him.  Sonny takes the chair but gets stuck when his mainhenchman, the great giant Luca Brasi, gets killed.  Michael hatches a brilliant plan to kill Solozzo and a crooked police captain as well, this he does and goes to his native Sicily in hiding.  I won't tell you the rest as that defies the object of encouraging you to read the book.    This book is great because of its humanness in that everyone here is just a normal person only in very different circumstances, but they still think like us.  The Mafia here aren't the monsters we ecpect them to be, they are the salt of the earth, great people, nice people who just have to kill people sometimes.  It also explores the relationships in a family and in a way is also satirical(in the chapter where Jonny Fontaine thinks about life in the 40's Hollywood).  It is a story of friendships, love, betrayal, honour and most importantly: family.   The only way in which this book is possibly flawed is where Puzo talks about irrelevant things like Lucy Mancini's life and Jonny Fontaine's career.  That apart this book is perfect, it is a true masterpiece.  A must read.
B00004R99J|2.0|There is nothing like watching a DVD, a crowning glory of Western technology, that argues that all cultures are equal.  At one point in this oppressive PC film, the not-at-all historical &quot;Pocahontas&quot; asks how John Smith can think that his culture is &quot;better.&quot;  One might suggest literacy as a basic improvement.  Or the ability to make movies.  This Disney film is dull and plodding.  In my experience, once you buy it kids will seldom choose it, if you have a big enough Disney library.
0060975768|5.0|I wasn't there, after reading this book I am glad I missed it! If people have the perception that that American soldiers did not achieve anything in Vietnam, or they believe the American soldier is not up to the job of combat, then read this book. It tells of camaraderie, bravery and heroism. Of men paying the ultimate price so that their comrades could live. It also tells of poor leadership, but also of good leadership and good command and control that eventually recovered the situation. It gives it as it was and pulls no punches and tells of 450 men fighting for their lives, as the only other option at the hands of the North Vietnamese Army was death. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down and I believe it to be one of the best accounts of the front line soldier fighting in Vietnam.
B00000JPH5|5.0|When i was a child, i watched this movie for the first time, captiated by Sarah's motivation, and Bowie's charm. It's been my dream since i was a little girl to have such an enchanting experience. This movie is one that i think of as a classic from when i was young, and i truly appreciate and cherrish the memory it has left for me. David Bowie is as wonderufl as ever in this film (for all the Bowie fans out there). i reccomend this movie to all of you with an open mind, and love for fantasy!
B000004286|4.0|Like many others, I watched the movie and thought the music was spectacular.  I got the CD, hoping that I could relax to the Celtic music.  However, there are many times when the relaxing atmosphere is interrupted by the movie dialogue.  If 'dialogue included' is what you want, then this is for you.  If you are looking for ambient Celtic music to cool out to, then I'd stay away from this.
B000001GBJ|5.0|In the rainy night, I've heard Songs Of A Secret Garden. Their songs touched my heart.  That the  time I became a secret garden fan.  Once my friends borrowed the casette, they loved it. I recomended this for you too, if you want to hear something that can touch your soul.
1573221562|5.0|Kudos to Ms. Waters for writing yet another beautifully crafted story!  I did not get into this book as easily as I did with Tipping the Velvet, but I wasn't any less fulfilled by novel's end.  Sarah Waters's words teem with life and her characters are expertly developed.  Affinity was a gripping tale, masterfully created--slowly but surely--to horrify and mystify the reader.  It does take 100 or so pages to get the plot rolling, but after having completed the book, I realize the pace of the novel was necessary to the entire flow of the story.  The ending did a complete 180 from what I expected it to be.  I was on the edge of my seat and holding my breath while reading the conclusion to this fascinating novel.  You will too.

B00003CWTI|5.0|It's hard to express exactly what I feel about this film.  I've only watched it a couple of times (though I own the DVD, and I think I might pop it in this weekend)...but already it has left its mark on me.  No other film I've ever seen had such an inspiring, emotional effect on me personally - now, I'm a college student, a guy, and it's hard for me to get emotional about anything.  <br />Boogie Nights had been my favorite (and yep, I picked up the 2-disc Platinum series of that the same time I bought Magnolia), but after only two viewings I know I'll probably never come across another film that provokes such an emotional response.<br />I think Paul Thomas Anderson is a genius.  Hard Eight was a beautiful small-scale, slowly paced film; Boogie Nights was the antithesis, a brilliant, rocking ride; and he's finally acheived true cinematic greatness with Magnolia.  <br />It takes a lot of effort to remember you're watching actors.  That's how much the performances meant to me.  Because they're so believable, you develop a large personal insterest in the characters, so it's easy to become emotional while watching the film.  &quot;Wise up&quot; might have been the single most beautiful sequence I have ever seen put to film.  I guess it might be unusual for a college guy to get emotional while watching a movie, but I'd be lying if I didn't say I cried every time this sequence comes up...<br />The DVD is also excellent.  I was disappointed when I first heard there was no commentary (because PT Anderson is so great with them; check out his own Hard Eight and Boogie Nights).  I later learned that he didn't want to do a commentary track, and do you really want three hours of something that would be so forced and intermittent given the circumstances?  Instead we're given a 75-minute documentary which is a fantastic profile into the development and production of the film.  It's a perfect compliment to the film.  In addition to the documentary, you get the Frank T.J. Mackey seminar (I really have to try the &quot;you know exactly what you did&quot; bit some time...), a Mackey infomercial, the music video to Aimee Mann's Save Me (directed by Anderson), and over a dozen trailers and teasers.  And check out those color bars; the outtakes are great.  The moments with Luis Guzman at the quiz show table and John C. Reilly during the &quot;Wise Up&quot; sequence are good for some great belly laughs.  <br />Maybe the DVD extras as they stand are the perfect commentary to the film.  Kudos to New Line for putting together such a comprehensive experience which goes so far beyond the film; along with the new Boogie Nights set (also fantastic), they're right up there with Criterion in my book).  <br />Big congratulations to P.T. Anderson for another masterpiece.  It's going to be nearly impossible to top this one, but don't count him out.  He's surprised me every time he's made a film yet.<br />This may be the best film you'll ever see.  Or you might hate it.  But you're doing yourself a huge disservice if you don't watch it.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I love this CD! I would give it 10,000,000 stars if I could! All the songs are great, the guys are dreamy, and they're just great!
0780021967|4.0|This film is great, we all know that, so I won't bother you too much with endless &quot;Hitchcock is a genius&quot;-talk. Instead I'll say a little about one of the featured actors, and review the DVD itself and its content/quality. Frank Cellier who plays the sheriff in &quot;The 39 Steps&quot;, was an interesting British character actor I've become aware of only quite recently. He was often cast in rather small supporting roles, and the sheriff part here is extremely small. -Two short scenes, to be precise. Hitchcock liked to work with the same actors again and again, but I wonder why he only used this tremendously carismatic actor in this one film, and never again. -This leads me to the picture quality of the Criterion DVD I'm reviewing here. Quite recently I saw a superb new print (on tape, no less !!!) of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; that just left me breathless. -Made the year before &quot;Steps&quot;, it looked absolutely brilliant and a million times sharper, brighter and cleaner than this particular Criterion print of &quot;Steps&quot;. -This minor &quot;disappointment&quot; regarding this DVD of &quot;Steps&quot;, also prevents me from giving it 5 stars, but I live in the hope that we're yet to see the ultimate &quot;Steps&quot; some day. (-1936's &quot;Sabotage&quot; is another Hitch gem that never looked too crisp either, but worthy of a clean-up also.) Finally, I'll just say a few words about commentator Marian Keane's rather mediocre talk on the commentary track. It's one of those commentaries that mostly reflect on the obvious; that's the storyline and what we see on screen. My favorite kind of commentator gives us some background info on all the performers, and what went into making the film. Keane talks in an almost erotic (!) voice, as if she's reading aloud from some cheap romantic novel. (-Maybe it's her usual style, but let's just say she's no Bruce Eder.) One odd comment in particular had me almost falling down from the couch, when sheproclaimed that the suspicious glare of the farmer Crofter through the window at his young wife and Hannay, &quot;clearly&quot; indicates that he (Crofter) is impotent! That's a new one to me, indeed. -I always just saw him as someone highly suspicious of all strangers, that's all. She also seem to lay way too much importance on every single shot in the film. Granted, Hitchcock's thrillers are seen as genius movie-making now (and rightfully so), but foremost I believe he was just trying to make good entertainment and suspenseful movies every time. He succeeded like few other directors have, surely that doesn't take a genius to see.

B00004Z459|5.0|I think this is probably my favorite album of the year.  These guys are totally original, even though they are another  so-called &quot;rap-metal&quot; band.  They use scratching, electronic sampling, two vocalists, and no bassist to come up with a sound unlike anyone else.  The sampling and scratching create good atmosphere and beats, while the two vocalists(one is a rapper,the other a singer)feed off each other very well.  <br />The best attributes of the band I think would have to be the lyrics though, which are both well written and meaningful.  This is a definite buy for anyone who likes talented musicians and quality lyrics.
B00000DG1R|5.0|'Greatest' is exactly the right title for this album - Duran Duran were never about the merely 'good', they were always larger-than-life, and equally loved and hated for it. At the height of their success they were much-reviled in the UK - being almost the exact opposite of the Smiths - but their flashy, trashy pop music is irrestiable nowadays, and, on the evidence here, their later music manages to be mature without being boring. The album is in roughly chronological order, and is cleverly-chosen to match the sequence that fans might have found their music - it starts with their massively-popular singles, moves backwards, and then goes onwards from there.<br />'Planet Earth' and 'Girls on Film' are catchy pop, marred only by thin production that highlights Le Bon's lack of vocal technique (he shouts, and that's it). Popular in the UK, they meant nothing in the US until 'Rio' and the two albums immediately afterwards, and from this period comes the bulk of the album. 'The reflex', 'Is there something I should know?', 'Hungry like the wolf' and so forther are classic pop - lyrically meaningless ('they say you're easy, but you're about as easy as a nuclear war' is one of the classic bad pop lyrics), but loud and catchy. And although they were never in danger of being hailed as the new Beatles, they were not manufactured, and they wrote and performed their own music. There is no modern equivalent.<br />After that they went 'hard', with the laughable 'Wild boys'. Famed for an extremely expensive video, it's as boring as it was at the time, and was something of a nadir. The overblown 'Arena' album died a death, and Duran Duran first went funk, with 'Notorious', and then pop-house, with 'I don't want your love' and 'All she wants is'. Despite my memories of them at the time, they're actually quite good.<br />In the nineties the group seemed to fade away. 'Ordinary World', a gorgeously-produced Nilsson-esque ballad about humility was something of a shock, whilst the similar 'Come Undone' actually has some proper singing on it. These two songs, plus 'Serious' and 'Save a prayer' reveal a talent for ballads that was never really appreciated at the time. The obligatory modern single, 'Electric Barbarella', is odd - there's a great schreechy guitar solo and it's catchy, although it sounds strangely old-fashioned, like Landscape but with better production.<br />All in all, it's a fantastic momento of one of the most characterful groups of the eighties, and a reminder that they were excellent in their own way. It's okay to like them nowadays.
6304286961|1.0|Oliver Stone yet again tramples and distorts the truth - this time the victim is Jim Morrison and not the U.S. government. Every scene is either blown way out of context or it never actually happened: There was no acid trip to the desert; Pam and Jim did NOT meet the way it was depicted in this film; Patricia Kennealy NOT meet Jim at the time and place shown in this movie; neither did Patricia meet Pam in that ridiculous &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; scene(which, by the way, never happened either).   Val Kilmer's character comes across as an airheaded baffoon -  never to match the personality with Morrison's geniusness.  Furthermore, Kyle McLaughlan's performance as Ray Manzarek (another genius)is lame; Kevin Dillon's portrayal of John Densmore is that of an uptight and neurotic Jim Morrison-hater; and Robby Krieger is an airhead as well. ALL FALSE!   This movie was not about the Doors, or Jim Morrison's life, nor was it about America in the 1960's. The only thing good and authentic about this film is the music.  I just can't help but wonder why Manzarek didn't make a film about Morrison. After all, Ray Manzarek has a graduate degree from film school and he was with Morrison from the beginning to the end, and they were the best of friends. Maybe one day, huh Ray? Until then, I advise anyone NOT to see this awful and disrespectful movie.
B000002U84|5.0|This was the biggie, the album that grabbed the broke the United States over its knee and threw the splinters away with disdain. Although 'Seven and the Ragged Tiger' was the height of their fame, this still contains three of their most recognisable hit singles, and cemented their image in the public mind - all trashy cheap glamour, hated and loved at the same time. The 'Rio' video, with the band performing the song on an expensive yacht in the Carribean, is their defining moment, and one of the enduring images of the 80's pop scene.<br />Apart from 'Hungry like the wolf', 'Save a prayer' and 'Rio', most of the rest of the album could also have been single-ised with equal success (apart from 'The Chauffer' - an atmospheric, almost ambient instrumental piece). If you're into vintage synths it's great, too, as the whole thing is plastered with Jupiter 8 noises (such as the arpeggio running throughout the title track).<br />Best of all, it doesn't go on too long, it's isn't dull, and it's cheap! What more do you want?
0800132343|5.0|Although i haven't seen this on a proper video (only recorded off the TV), this has got to be one of the best films of all time. I am going to buy this directors cut for my father, as i'm sure he will enjoy it enormously. It has everything: suspense, humour, drama... I can't wait to watch it again (i've counted 4 times now). Anybody who is interested in the way the german sailors thought (none of that nasty german rubbish here: they had feelings too!) should watch this film.
B00004YRQA|5.0|One thing for all you shoppers out there!  I have a PS2 and it seems that some of the games may allow you to use the old PS memory cards, but not all!  I have the game &quot;Midnight Club: Street Racing&quot; and it requires a PS2 8 MB memory card, nothing less!  I thought that since I had an PS 360 block memory card I would be alright for a while...Nope! No luck there!  So if you already have a new memory card, congrats...you are one of the lucky ones!  I have to wait a few more months until they are available again around here!
B00004XOWM|1.0|The new LB cd is Significant Other re-released, except not as good. They should have called it Significant Other II. The music, rhythms, beats, echoes, even the lyrics - virtually identical. I like the LB, don't get me wrong, but I was expecting a little more creativeness on this one. I should have just bought another copy of Significant Other. What a disappointment. Save your money.
0767849493|4.0|I loved this film. It was funny, ironic, intelligent, and addressed fundamental existential questions without offering any easy answers. I understand that the pious may be offended (some of the film is a little over the top). And I am tempted to say that makes the film all the more appealing. But really, I hope my religious friends will not take the film personally, but laugh along with the rest of us.
B000002U8G|5.0|My review of the song, &quot;Echoes&quot; can be summed up as follows, taken straight from the dictionary. I think that all of these words define the experience of Echoes fairly well.

6304698682|4.0|Although the story is almost identical to Shane, no one makes a better western than Clint.  This one completes my Clint Eastwood western trilogy.  While this ranks third behind The Outlaw Josey Wales and Unforgiven, it is still one of the best westerns ever made.  The movie is intense and all the actors do a great job.  The DVD copy is not great.  The surround sound is great but the picture flutters quite a bit.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I first heard the Nocturne of the album during a slow Waltz dance in a ballroom. It was such a beautiful and moving piece of music. Many dance music CDs have this song with added Waltz beats. I can't think of any other music that is more inviting than this one for the dance. It might be the only song that adds a soul to the waltz dance. I later found the  album and equally enjoyed all rest of the songs in it.
B00001U0GQ|3.0|After reading James Fenimore Cooper's Last of the Mohicans, I was thrilled to see the cinematic portrayal of Hawkeye, one of the most interesting characters of any character I have read about.  This movie destroys that image, and the movie has nothing to do with the book. If I had never read the book, this would be one of the better movies I have seen, but knowing that they butchered a phenomenol story and damaged the integrity of the characters is a dissapointment to me.  This is a great movie, a great love story, but really I had to seperate the movie from the book.  If you want to just see a good movie, then buy this DVD, but if you want an accurate portrayal of the visions of a great American novelist, Cooper, then by no means buy this movie.
0062502182|5.0|I read &quot;The Alchemist&quot; almost 4 years ago now, and have re-read it for inspiration several times since.<br />After reading this fable about following one's dreams, I was inspired to walk my own path.

B00003003R|4.0|First, the title is misleading.  It wasn't, as the back cover claims, \\"recorded across the universe between 1987 and 1993.\\"  It's a concert from the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" tour of `91-'93.  It's obvious they've been touring for years.  You can hear the strain years of performing are have taken on Axl's voice.  There's little of the raw energy of \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" or the dark brooding of \\"Lies.\\"  Other instruments (Dizzy Reed's keyboards, the horns on \\"Move to the City\\") are being showcased at the expense of Slash's (and maybe Izzy's) guitars.<br />Some choices for the songs are questionable.  Why include the covers of Black Sabbath's \\"It's Alright\\" and Bob Dylan's \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door\\" when there's so much (too much?) quality original Guns N' Roses material?  Why aren't \\"Coma\\" and \\"Think About You\\" on this album instead?  Are the Geffen executives who put this together just stuffed suits and not fans?  Sorry, stupid question.<br />This album is worth your money only if you are a hard-core Guns N' Roses fan.  It's especially worthwhile if, like me, you're a hard-core fan, but was too young to catch them in concert.  If you regret the self-destruction of Guns N' Roses, then put on this album, imagine yourself at a concert and think of what might have been.
0441172717|5.0|The Dune cronicals by Frank Herbert are the greatest literary works I have ever read.  After having read all seven books concerning the Dune universe I always find myself reading Dune over and over again.  I can't help but be drawn back to the original triumph of Atreides over their enemies the Harkonens.  The majesty with witch Herbert relates this epic tale is amazing. If you are considering Buying any type of book this would be my recomendation.
B000000OQY|4.0|I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if I could, but I digress.<br />As has been said before, this album is the compilation of the \\"Live Like a Suicide\\" EP, released before \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" broke the Gunners out nationally, and some live tracks.<br />As you listen to this album, you can place yourself in the Whiskey or the Troubadour, listening to a concert of the early Gunners.  In songs like \\"Reckless Life,\\" \\"One in a Million\\" [Back off this song.  It's an honest look at what an isolated farm boy like Axl would experience upon coming to the bizarre world of L.A. for the first time,] \\"Move to the City,\\" and the sarcastic \\"Used to Love Her,\\" you can hear the beginnings of the Guns N' Roses sound.  Those tracks speak of the poor, drug-addled, seamy underbelly of L.A. that Guns inhabited at the time, and would later explore on \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"My Michelle.\\"  The \\"I'm raging at everything and everybody\\" mentality of \\"Reckless Life\\" would later be showcased on \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" from \\"Appetite.\\"  The semi-acoustic version of \\"You're Crazy\\" is superior to the punk version that appeared on \\"Appetite.\\"<br />Ironically, this album's biggest hit, \\"Patience,\\" is the song that doesn't fit.  It's a beautiful ballad of love and devotion despite the odds, probably one of several (including &quot;Sweet Child O' Mine&quot; and &quot;Think About You&quot;) written about Erin Everly, Axl's wife.  It's upbeat and optimistic, whereas the rest of the album is dark and brooding.  \\"My Michelle\\" and \\"Patience\\" probably should have swapped albums.  Impossible, I know, because \\"Michelle\\" was out on \\"Appetite\\" already, but it would have made \\"Lies\\" flow much better, with a consistent dark edge to it. <br />If you are a Guns N' Roses fan, you probably own this album already.  But if you don't, go ahead and pick it up.  Then turn on your CD player and think back to the early '80s, when Guns N' Roses were as dark, hungry, and lean as they are on \\"Lies.\\"  They had their whole careers aheadof them.  Enjoy them as they were.

B000000OQF|5.0|In 1987, Guns N' Roses exploded onto the national scene with \\"Appetite for Destruction.\\"  It was their first and best album.  On the first track, \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\"  Slash's beginning riffs and Axl's eerie howl set the stage for the rest of the songs.  \\"Jungle\\" is a no-holds-barred look at the dark, drug-infested world beneath the glitz-and-glamour exterior of Los Angeles.  \\"It's So Easy\\" shows the heart of the band: Axl's interplay with Slash and Izzy Straldlin.  \\"Night Train\\" is another exploration of the sex, drug, and alcohol-fueled world of an L.A. club band at the time that Guns was coming up.  \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" is the first glimpse of Axl's paranoia and self-absorption, which would ultimately lead to the band's downfall.  \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" is a song about (surprise!) heroin, and with the lyrics \\"the show usually starts around 7.  We go on stage around 9,\\" it would prove prophetic about the chaotic nature of Guns N' Roses and their live concerts.  \\"Paradise City\\" begins in (and the choruses return to) a Southern-Rock style, but is mostly the blues-and-punk-flavored hard rock that made them famous.<br />\\"My Michelle\\" is the darkest song Guns N' Roses ever produced.  It's the semi-true story of a girl trying to grow up in L.A. without any support from her family, and then falling prey to the demons of wanton sex and drugs.  \\"Think About You\\" is one of the most under-rated Guns songs.  It's a sweet ballad about first love, but set to a hard-rock beat.  Not a power-ballad, but a great song that never got the acclaim it deserved.  \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" is another love song set to a rock beat, and showcases Slash's unique talents as a guitarist probably better than any other song on the record.  \\"You're Crazy\\" shows the band's punk influences.  \\"Anything Goes\\" is a straight rocker about a mutually self-destructive relationship.  The record ends with \\"Rocket Queen,\\" one of their best, and least appreciated.  Slash and Izzy's guitar greatness are on display here probably better than anywhere else in the album.  \\"Rocket Queen\\" also shows Axl's vocal and song writing talent.  It starts as a rocker about a virile young stud (probably Axl) and an older woman.  But after the famous interlude, (if you don't know what I mean, find out for yourself,) the song switches gears seamlessly, to a mellow ballad about friendship and love through tough times.  It's a truly amazing song.<br />The cassette version of &quot;Appetite&quot; is the first album I ever bought.  Time has not diminished the impact of these songs for me.  Guns N' Roses are my personal favorite band, and \\"Appetite\\" is their high point.  As they say, once you reach a peak, it's all downhill, but that's not important.  What is important is to remember them as what they were: a definitively groundbreaking band.
0312932081|5.0|I know that there are 1214 other customer reviews about this book; I need to write a 1215th anyway.<br />I read this book first when I was in fifth grade.  I remember sitting at my desk near the side wall in Mrs. Lopiparo's classroom and reading the final few chapters.  I began to cry.  When I looked up, through a dizzy of emotion I could see that Mrs. Lopiparo and the other students were looking at me.  I couldn't think, I couldn't say anything; I just buried my head in my arms and cried.<br />Now I am a junior in college, and my roommates are reading Ender's Game for the first time.  I get excited just thinking about that first reading of theirs--the first one!--and I know that, even though they may not cry as I did as a fifth-grader, their first reading won't be their last.
B00004Z459|5.0|A triumphant mix of different musical backgrounds and stylings. Linkin Park uses their musical stylings to apease all that listen. Fred Durst will soon be crying that he ever talked s**t about Chester. Death to Fred Durst. Linkin Park will out rock Limp Noodle anyday. Linkin Park knows how to rock, but they aren't afraid to make beautiful melodies as well. Track 8 is one of my favorites. It gives me chills. I love the piano that acompanies Chester's vocals.
052594527X|4.0|Inspired by the mystery in a Vermeer picture on her wall, author Tracy Chevalier created a story of a young girl to explain the enigma behind the figure in the painting.  Who was the girl? What did she have to do with the painter Vermeer? These questions are answered in the skillfully written historical fiction novel, Girl with a Pearl Earring.  Griet, a young Protestant girl on the verge of becoming a woman, goes to work for the Catholic Vermeer family during the 1600's. The malevolent battle between these two opposing Christian denominations is displayed through the tension felt between Griet and the Vermeer family.  During her stay with the Vermeers, Griet matures through her work and life in the household. By assisting Vermeer with his artwork, she gains artistic vision and learns how to better appreciate art and the world around her.  Griet not only grows by becoming more perceptive and tolerant of things unfamiliar to her, but she also gains awareness of the role women play in society.  She attains this newfound understanding through the complex relationships with her overbearing suitor and her reserved yet demanding master.  At the crossroads between adolescence and womanhood, she must consider the developments of these relationships in order to decide the course that the remainder of her life will take.  This touching novel maintains the reader's attention through vivid descriptions of characters and emotional complications. An education in the historic background of Vermeer's time and paintings can be acquired through reading Chevalier's book.
B00004Z1MN|5.0|Like any movie fanatic, I drove to the movies expecting just another tuff guy, sci-fi flick. Boy was I wrong! Frequency had me glued to my seat. From beginning to end this movie had romance, action, suspense, mystery and hope. It was heart warming and well written. Also if you are into father and son bonding movies like &quot;Field of Dreams&quot;, this movie will leave you bawling and wanting to call your father. Rent it today!
0790742780|4.0|Movie Critics are morons. All of these characters ARE stereotypes, as are the characters in 85% of Hollywood's movies today. Panning this movie for it's blatent use of these cliched people kind of misses 'the point' they were looking for. People are ugly, racist, and selfish. This man (with serious emotional problems) takes a look around his world (downtown LA) and slowly begins breaking down. How many of us can identify with the idea of the American Dream gone wrong? Being menaced by a gang? Being lied to by advertising?  'they lie to everybody'. Micheal Douglas portrayal of a Joe Blow gone bad is mesmerizing. Unlike 'Payback', I actually found myself rooting for the 'bad guy'. What Douglas does is ugly, what we all see everyday is ugly. Robert Duvall (as mentioned before) is rock solid.<br />The DVD's main benefit is crystal clear audio and video. It features scene selection and the trailer. Had it included a few extras (Like a MD or RD commentary track, I'd rate it a 5).  This movie is about the 'average man' in a cruddy world who can't take it anymore. He could have been someone you worked with, or saw when you're getting off the bus, or waitied in line behind. And THAT was the point of this movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Can it really be 7 years and three albums since I began college and adopted \\"Creep\\" as my personal anthem of alienation? Forget Thom Yorke; that song was about ME, damnit-LOL! I heard it and projected my own angst and depression onto the lyrics.<br />However, I have to admit that, following the success of \\"Creep\\", I didn't pay much attention to Radiohead. \\"The Bends\\" came and went, and the only song I liked from that record was \\"High and Dry\\".<br />Then came 1997 and \\"Ok Computer\\". Rave reviews and the standout singles \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"No Surprises\\" piqued my curiosity, which finally got the better of me when I finally went out and bought the album. Upon first listen, I was far from impressed. Aside from the aforementioned singles, I liked \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" on the level that one likes any old radio single (i.e., it was catchy, and caused me to hit repeat on my CD player several times). But the rest of the album seemed, somehow, unreachable.<br />Fast forward a few months later, when I popped OKC into my CD player again, and listened to it from start to finish for the first time since I bought it. Where before, I found the jolting guitar at the start of \\"Airbag\\" disconcerting, I now took comfort in it. Suddenly, I was able to see the epic beauty of \\"Paranoid Android\\". \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\" became more than just another radio song; I finally heard and understood the simultaneous tranquility and desperation in its lyrics (Yorke makes alien abduction sound like quite the sublime experience). \\"Exit (Music For A Film)\\" and \\"Let Down\\" proved exquisite in both their pain and their majesty. And, on \\"Lucky\\" and \\"The Tourist\\" I found songs in which I could literally lose myself. Most importantly, I found a moment in each song that touched my soul (when Thom Yorke sings \\"it's going to be a glorious day\\" for the second time on \\"Lucky\\"; or when the chanting begins on \\"Paranoid Android\\"; or Yorke's sweet scream of \\"you'll know where you are\\" near the end of\\"Let Down\\"). Now, I understood what all that raving was about at the end of 1997, when critics tripped over themselves to praise this album as one of the decade's best. It would be another four or five listens before I could fully process the thematic content of the lyrics on the album. Once I did, the power of the album truly struck me. On OKC, Radiohead vocalize the anxieties we all share about living in this microwaved age, but are too scared or deadened to verbalize ourselves. Are we sacrificing our humanity at the altar of technological advancement? Radiohead seem to reach a pretty bleak conclusion on OKC, but, in the end, the album moved me so much that I bought \\"The Bends\\", an equally stunning gem. As with OKC, it took me a few listens to get into \\"The Bends\\", but the thing I've come to love about Radiohead's music is its very inaccessibility. It is NOT easy. It is (to employ an overused critical term) DIFFICULT.<br />But I'm finally starting to understand that Radiohead are worth it. Worth the hype. Worth the pretension (real or perceived). Worth a permanent place in any album collection. Worth more than just one listen. Worth the work it takes to fully comprehend their albums. Most of all, Radiohead are worth the hope that rock music can do more than entertain, and even move. Radiohead are proof that rock music can still challenge our comfortable existence (see \\"Fitter Happier\\"), question our most deeply held beliefs, and leave us thinking long after the last note has played.<br />I affectionately call \\"OK Computer\\" my learning album. I had to learn to love it, and I would not have had it any other way.

B00003CX7L|5.0|This film was, at one point, slated for &quot;straight-to-video&quot; hell until Disney got it's head out of it's computer software and re-hired Tom Hanks and Tim Allen to make this wonderful &quot;Toy Story&quot; sequel. Faster, bolder, and even MORE human than the first, &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; takes the &quot;toys as humans too&quot; concept to such lengths that you might find yourself feeling guilty about the way you treated your own toys when you were young. It's a wild ride, definitely one for the kids, and it comes highly recommended by me.
B000000H5J|4.0|Unless there is a rare Fear Factory album that I don't know about, this has to be thier best. It's really heavy, the drums are amazingly fast and Burton C. Bell just has an amazing voice. Obsolete is like this but not as good and Soul Of A New Machine is less intelligent, piling out ridiculously heavy riffs with a lack of variation. It's not a bad album by any means, but this (being thier next album and therefore a follow up) but have blown some fans of the earlier stuff away. It may not be a classic heavy metal album (due to the lack of any guitar solos and the basic fact that it's not THAT good) but I definately recommend this. Zero Signal is amazing and Demanufacture, Self Bias Resistor and Pisschrist are all great FF songs. If your new to Fear Factory then you must get this. If you like this then you may want to check out: Machine Head, Sepultura, Slayer, Pantera, Black Label Society, Entombed or Pissing Razors.
B00004U30D|5.0|This is one of those films that is nearly impossible to define in a single sentence. It could be described as the story of a dysfunctional family who decided one day to drop the masks and the plasticity of suburban life and lead the lives of true individuals. It could also be described as a film about beauty, ugliness, emptiness, pain, and so many feelings and emotions that people of all generations feel, that it can relate to almost everyone. Spacey and Bening Jr. are electric on the screen. They brought a radiance and energy to the script that few others could have pulled off. It is a serious film about serious topics, and there can be no other rating but the highest one: 5 Stars.
0312853238|5.0|Being only thirteen you may think that my review is pointless... Well screw you! I think this book captivates many emotions along with an exciting plot. I could never seem to put this book down. The way Ender changes throughout the book is ingenious! I can't say enough good things about this book. Anyone who likes a good read... BUY IT!!!
B00001QGIQ|5.0|Our century can be proud of roughly a dozen artistic geniuses. Walt Disney was one of them. This movie will testify that statement. His 3 or 4 first full-lenghth films were already the climax, which was never again paralleled. This to me, is one of the best 10 celluloid works of all times. It's simply perfect and Disney didn't get the financial support afterwards that enabled him to create this breathtaking masterwork. Nowadays, there's so much emphasis on the highly praised &quot;effects orgies&quot;, but they are mere trilbies, compared to this &quot;chapeau magique&quot;.
0812550757|5.0|This is as far as I have gotten in the series and by the end of this book I was stunned! Orson Scott Card is a brilliant writer! I just can't wait to read the next book!
B00003CXFG|5.0|Pitch Black is the best science fiction movie of the year. The Special Effects and Cinematography alone is worth the price of the movie or the purchase of the DVD.  One of the aspects of the movie that was outstanding was the visual reference to binary star systems that do exit in the universe.The exceptional visual references to the binary stars color of light as it came down to the planet was incredible.This created an environment that help make the characters dilemma very compelling. The writers of the movie did their homework and gave us a scientific treat as well as a visual feast.  The Special effects were nothing short of real genius and the digital sound was outstanding. The opening crash scene was most memorable with the crews spaceship crash landing on the barren planet.  The characters in the movie were intriguing and kept your attention thorough out the movie.  Radha Mitchell's character was very well written and made for excellent entertainment.  She was very real and easy to identify with.  Hollywood may have found their next great Science Fiction actor in Vin Diesel .  His character was most believable and profound.  Hollywood has found their next great science fiction actor.  I highly recommend the movie for all science fiction fans.
B000002HRE|5.0|First off I am a huge metallica  fan of the old days and I still believe Master of Pupetts and Ride the Lightning still rule metal but that does not mean there is no room for an album like REload. This album is alot simpler than any other album metallica has done even when compared to load. It is just a compilation of great enjoyable songs with the almighty metallica feel to it. REload is not for people that like to bang their heads against walls when listening to music, it is for the people that approach music with an open mind and enjoy the music for all its worth. The Unforgiven 2 which is track 4 on this album is timeless and a great song all round. Dont listen to all this hype surrounding metallica just buy this ablum! Isn't anyone starting to catch on that people are always TRYING to find a reason to hate metallica. They are the BEST BAND IN THE WORLD PERIOD! I will end it at that.
0679879269|5.0|A tremendous conclusion to the series! Pullman ties all the characters,plots and suspense to a glorious and exciting end. One of the best books I've read in a long, long time!
B00003CWTI|5.0|Some of the reviews im reading here are pathetic.<br />I keepreading that 'Cruise steals the show' that is a lot of .... I would not say that there is just one main part, each character is just as important as the next and each is focused on the same amount of time. Another thing people are saying 'its too long'. NOWAY! The length is good for this type of movie. <br />It is brilliant, i am actually writing this as i am watching it for the second time. Honestly i would call this a suspense film. For most other movies you always feel this 'great sensation' of suspense at the very end of the movie. But this did not happy with this movie, i felt this sensation throughout more than half of the movie. I could not look away, and if anything i was hoping it would not end.<br />So those are just a few things i thought i should share. I would consider this being one of my favourite movies and if you dont go see it, you have no idea what you are missing out off. YOU WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING LIKE IT. It is a near masterpiece.
B000002GYW|5.0|I HAVE OWNED ALL OF THE EAGLES ALBUMS, AND BY A NOSE FEEL DESPERADO IS THE BEST OF THE LOT. EACH SONG SEEMED TO SHOWCASE THE STRONG POINT OF AT LEAST ONE OF THE BAND MEMBERS. FOR PEOPLE WHO ENJOYED THE COUNTRY SIDE TO THE EAGLES,THIS ONE HAD THE HAUNTING VOCAL HARMONIES TO BANJO INSTRUMENTALS THAT NEVER QUITE MADE IT BACK AFTER DESPERADO. IF YOU JUST LIKE ELECTRIC GUITAR SLASHES AND DRUMS POUNDING, THIS PROBABLY AINT YOUR ALBUM. BUT IF YOU WERE INTO THE VOCAL HARMONIES AND BLUEGRASS STYLE PICKIN' OF THE EAGLES BEFORE HOTEL CALIFORNIA, THIS IS IT. THE DOOLIN-DALTON/DESPERADO REPRISE IS THE BEST SONG NEVER RELEASED AS A SINGLE.
0375704027|4.0|As a Japanese national, since I moved to Cambridge for graduate study, I have been astonished by overwhelming excellent reviews by non-Japanese folks. It is because the set-up is very much Tokyo-ish. I could recognize most of the geographical parts that he refers in the novel. And, there is actually a famous private dorm for college students like Watanabe in the northwestern part of Tokyo, it is called Wakei-juku, which is close to a university Watanabe seemed to attend and was close to my old house. The novel well dipicts the atmosphere of Japanese university life around 1980s. I feel happy that many non-Japanese readers enjoyed this book years later. Murakami himself spent a few years at Princeton and Tufts as a guest writer years back. I have read virtually all the Murakami's books, and I can say &quot;Norway&quot; is good, but you have to go on to further appreciate the Murakami World.

0345423496|2.0|Oh God, Arthur!  Why why why!  Why did you have to write this book?  It was flat, unimaginative, and a complete waste of my time as a science fiction reader/fanatic.  If it weren't for some basic information that led you back to the series I would have given this book one star.  But I gave it two because it looked so pathetic setting next to its predecessors on my bookshelf.  Thank god its over!  Try the Dune series or Foundation series or Lord of the Ring series if you want true reading material.
B00004X01U|3.0|Music is better than the crap the teeny boppers are cranking out but that standard is so low that this accomplishment isn't saying much. Most of The vocal effects on this CD are dumb and the majority of the lyrics are run of the mill pop. The exception being What It Feels Like for a Girl. The songwriting is great on that one as is the instrumentation and vocal arrangements. Low points are the cornball ballad Paradise is not For Me, which is a shame because this is the only song where the vocal dub effect works beautifully. Too bad she didn't sing all the lyrics except the chorus in French, that way the bad song writing wouldn't get in the way of such fun orchestration. Amazing is another cool track. A better retread of Beautiful Stranger, which in my humble opinion sucked due to the lazy song writing. I like all the folk songs, but being a fan of Suzanna Vega and such Madonna's lyrics just don't measure up. This album is OK but not a keeper.

0679879269|5.0|Firstly i pay tribute to the series- what a great read they have given me. I must point out this is a very deep meaningful story that left me reeling at the end. I cried and cried, the tears would not stop and i simultaneously loved Pullman and hated him at the same time. The story is well constructed but it does not have that sense of magic and wonder as in the first book, instead chhosing to stroll a different path and creating a new genre of storytelling. This book is always pondering me .... making me think and wish it was only a bit different. Neverthless, when you start page one , you are in for a hell of a ride and this book seems so real so i keep trying to understand.... why..... if i could i would give it zero and full marks at the same time. Pullman spoils it but hey what a brilliant book !!!

0811826848|5.0|How can any Beatles fan not be delirious over the arrival of this book? I spent four hours glued to it, lovingly turning each page, laughing, smiling and astounded over so many previously unseen photos. I have 400 Beatles books in my collection in many different languages. This book beats them all in content, style, text, arrangement and producing pure bliss in the reader. Some of the early photos from the Cavern and Hamburg years have appeared before in Mike McGear's 1977 book, but there are other new photos when the boys were so young it's almost piercing to look at them.<br />My only slight criticism is that much of the text was lifted directly from the Beatles Anthology series. This was disappointing, but the soaring positives of this weighty book cancel out any whining. For all of us Beatles fans, this is the apex of what will be offered for a long time. You will cherish this book and get endless hours of fascination and enjoyment from it. John, Paul, George and Ringo...still producing powerful emotions. They always will.
B00000JJQK|5.0|I get something different out of this CD every time I hear it -- for me, the mark of an outstanding record.<br />When something new STILL pops out of the speakers after three years of listening.....well, I know I'm hearing one of the all-time greats.<br />I get the most out of PET SOUNDS on headphones.  Take a walk on the beach at dusk with this CD at medium volume, so you can hear the music interspersed with the crash of the surf and the cries of seagulls.  The music fits right in.  Brian Wilson absolutely captures the outdoor beauty of Southern California in 13 heavenly songs.<br />I won't get into the SGT. PEPPER - PET SOUNDS debate.  They're both masterpieces.  Let's just say both bands pushed each other to new levels of aural beauty -- a &quot;race&quot; that ultimately drove Wilson into seclusion.  One of pop music's finest.
B00004T9VY|5.0|1970 brought a collection of new artists/musicians that spoke directly to every listener. &quot;Tea For The Tillerman&quot; spoke with a poetic intimacy. Cat spoke from the first person. It was almost like reading (hearing) someone's diary. &quot;Where Do All The Children Play?&quot; begins a string of personal tales that are both pointed and political. The high quality of his vocals and poetics continues right through to &quot;Father And Son&quot;. His voice and music are both folksy and cutting edge. You feel like this young man has an &quot;old&quot; soul from which he drinks from daily. Every song holds up. &quot;Wild World&quot; was my introduction to Cat. I still find it one of rock's most poignant and hauntingly insightul song. As the years pass Cat's songs become more relevant. Just wish he had made some more music!
0375420525|4.0|Okay, here goes!  I just finished this book and felt compelled to tell the world about it.  This book is not for the easily bored or the casual reader.  It is a very intense and often frightening novel.  No there are no physical monsters or demons chasing the characters around.  This book deals with personal demons from the get go.  Disregard the author's note on the cover.  This is not a novel.  This is a convoluted, highly intellectual piece of work.  It has at least four plot lines to speak of and quite possibly more.  The story centers around a family that moves into a small two story home in Virginia, only to discover that it is much larger on the inside than on the outside.  Hallways appear unannounced and lead into infinity, and usually lead to some revelation about the character inside.  Okay so far?  That's plot one.  The second plot is how the characters in the house made a documentary about their house that became the popular horror film, &quot;The Navidson Record&quot; released by Miramax in the early nineties.  This film is watched by an elderly blind man who begins to write an exhaustive review of the movie.  Okay, plot number two, still okay?  Now, the old blind man dies at the beginning of the book, his work on the film review largely unfinished.  It is found by a young tattoo artist who begins to organize the material and ultimately finishes it for the old man.  That's plot three, still doing good?  Plot four is how reading the review and finishing it literally drives the tattoo artist over the edge. The text is designed to tell you who is writing and the footnotes are a must if you are to understand the story.  As you progress, you will figure out which ones are safe to skip, but I recommend trying to read as many of them as you can your first time through.  Be prepared, some of the footnotes are longer than the chapters they're in and often have footnotes themselves.  Also, the text is written so that you have to become involved with the story.  As the characters go deeper into the halls nonexistent hallways, the text begins to twist and turn, simulating their voyage into the house.  Ultimately, I found a page with nothing more than a single letter on it, turned upside down and sitting at an angle.  Also, there are pages with text that looks like you're going to have to get a mirror to read until you realize that its the same text as on the previous page, just mirror imaged.  All in all, this is the coolest, most involving book I've read in quite a while.<br />P.S.  By the way, did I tell you the documentary film doesn't exist?  That's the coolest part cause by the end of the story you'll be swearing it should.

Jean Seberg is particularly captivating, and it's a shame that her career never really took off. She was utterly beguiling.

0679879269|5.0|Hallu.  Okay, never ever ever ever have I read a series more enthralling than this one.  First of all, the Golden Compass was an absolute piece of art.  Then, the Subtle Knife left me in love with Will and his fierocity and determination.  The cliffhanger at the end of TSK made me fume.  Three years?<br />But I never expected a book like The Amber Spyglass.  It moves not too fast and not too slow, although my favorite parts were definitely the Lyra-Will sections.  I am still wondering about Mrs. Coulter.  Hmmmmmm.  Anyway, I cried during the part lee died in Subtle Knife, but at the end of TAS, there was a knot in my stomach.  I won't spoil it for anyone, but the ending of this book is truly powerful and heart-wrenching.  I think this book shows a lot of excellent morals and I hate hate hate that this is the last book, but there is really nothing more to tell.  So if you want an EXCELLENT read, hey, you came to the right place. <br />P.S. Makes more sense if you have read The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife.
B0000025ZK|1.0|As much as I hate to say it this album is shocking.  Thank god he shares lyrical writing with his wife Polly Samson now in the post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd, or else they surely would've went out with less than a fizzle.  There are two good songs on this album, 'Murder' and 'Near the End'. (By the way, has anyone ever realised how the riff on 'Near the End', is EXACTLY the same as the recurring riff on Roger Water's 'Pro's and Con's of Hitchhiking'?)  The rest of the album is just really bad 80's pop.  Especially 'Blue Light' and 'Cruise'.  What the hell?<br />I suppose David Gilmour just wanted to get away from anything to do with Pink Floyd or Roger Water's, so don't buy this expecting to get another dose of Floyd - because quite simply, it's not.  If this wasn't given to me as a christmas present, or I didn't like to collect everything Floyd related, I would throw this in the bin!  That's a bit extreme, I like 'Murder' too much.
