031606792X|3.0|I just finished reading this book yesterday, and I hated it. Stephanie Meyer is awful at writing romance; it seems so fake. Edward and bella are like constantly hanging on one another, and that is an obbsession. There was no character development at all, and some parts were confusing. Bella is a whiny sarcastic girl who wants nothing but edwards love and is quite dramatic at times. I would not waste my time on this book if I were you. or the series, for that matter.

B001E5FYS8|4.0|I thought it was a brilliant documentary. A little slow and confusing at times, but something that everyone should see at least once!
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|I was taken aback at how sloppy Amazon is by somehow getting this 30th Anniversary Special Edition DVD of this movie mixed up with the horrible Double Secret Probation Edition version.  That was a major mistake, since the 30th Anniversary Special Edition features:  1) NO, and I repeat NO forced ads or even previews for other movies at the beginning. It only features a quick 15-20 second Universal Studios splash, then straight to the menu screen.  2) A second DVD featuring a nice little documentary about the making of the movie, featuring all the main cast members, save (of course) the late and very great John Belushi (gone, but not forgotten) explaining nearly any aspect about what led up to the production, filming, and even how the actors in the Delta House and the Omegas actually WERE separated to inculcate some real rivalry that would translate well to the screen. You also get the theatrical trailer and a fun little Scene It (R) quiz about the movie.  3) The movie itself in glorious full 16x9 widescreen format, with excellent image quality and sound.  4) The first DVD also features an amusing little mockumentary about \\"Where are they now?\\" featuring most of the actors, including John \\"Dean Wormer\\" Vernon (RIP now, sadly) playing along to what had happened 30 years after the Deltas destroyed the parade.  5) Even the case is slightly better than most DVD cases, featuring the two small latches that prevent it from accidentally popping open.    About the movie itself, I need not comment for anyone who has already seen this, one of the funniest movies ever made.  For the rest of you, I suggest you not rent, but instead BUY, and buy this edition of the DVD.  Trust me, every so often, you will want to watch it over, by yourself or with friends.  As Belushi says after destroying the guitar from \\"Charming Guy with Guitar,\\" if you don't, you'll be \\"sorry!\\"
0143038419|1.0|A nauseating travelogue of a conceited self indulgent 30 something.  Incredibly hard to finish, but I forced myself.The first part of the book she spends howling on her bathroom floor.  I am soooo glad when she starts on the anti depressants but then she stops...big mistake.  Italy, hmmm she drools over her 20 something language partner, eats and buys underwear to take to the Ashram.  India she discovers she can't meditate. And talks. A lot.  Bali she self obsesses more, I really was glad her ex did well in the divorce.I really felt for the poor guy.  I think she would've done better had she stayed in a psychiatric facility and stayed on her meds.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Introduction:  I designed this review as a sort of encyclopedic critique of the each criticism I've found in the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere. To prove my nerdiness conclusively, I've indexed my responses to each criticism so you don't have to read the whole thing. You can just pick out the issues that concern you and get my scoop on them.    Introduction  1: Comfort  2: Large/Small hand friendliness  3: Keys Hard to Reach  4: WASD Keys Unmarked  5: Keys Hard to Press  6: Thumbstick Hard to Press  7: Thumbstick \\"loose\\" Feeling  8: Thumbstick not Analog  9: Thorny Thumbstick  10: Weak Game-recognition  11: Installation/Stability Issues  12: No In-game Profile-switching  13: LCD Weaknesses  14: Only One Brightness Level  15: Short Cord  16: Learning Curve  17: Size  Conclusion    1) Comfort  First thing I hear a lot about is ergonomics. People say the joystick is in a \\"cramped\\" or \\"alien\\" position, and act like your thumb is going to snap off after five minutes of play time. They have no leg to stand on as far as I'm concerned. True, your thumb will not be resting on the side like a mouse, but this isn't a mouse, and it's not the N52, and yet, somehow, it feels perfectly comfortable to me.    2) Large/Small Hands  Alongside ergonomic complaints I've read a number of people saying the G13 \\"isn't made for large hands\\" or \\"isn't made for small hands.\\" Evidently it was only made for medium-sized hands. I have huge hands, and I consider that my main advantage when using this board. Small hands I can see being a handicap, but I don't know for sure. If anything, this was made for big hands.    3) Keys Hard to Reach  In line with the above, many people say that the keys can be hard to reach. Well, first off, if you're getting a gameboard with a monstrous 20+ keys to press, some of them are just necessarily going to be further away than others. The only keys I have found took some practice to get to were the far left and bottom row keys since these are accessed by yourpinky finger snaking way on out there. However, all the keys are so well defined that they take very little practice getting used to. Even before memorizing them you can quickly feel your way around due to their excellently clear demarcations. You can see that from the picture. Also, you can hear your fingers feeling across each key, if you listen carefully, so you have auditory cues on top of tactile ones as to where the keys are relative to your fingers. In short, I have never, ever, once gotten lost on this thing despite its vast array of keys.    4) WASD Keys Unmarked  Another key-related complaint is that the central \\"WASD\\" keys have no bumps on them to find them easily. This is extremely misleading. No, they don't have bumps, what they have are indentations for your fingertips. Thus, even if you WERE blind and couldn't see their clear, glowing labels your fingertips would slip into them almost without you knowing it. And, no, they aren't labeled, \\"W\\" \\"A\\" \\"S\\" and \\"D\\" firstly because they don't have to be mapped to those keys and secondly because, as I said just now, they have indentations clearly setting them apart from the other keys.    5) Keys Hard to Press  Also, people have said that the keys are hard to press. That's a real jaw-dropper. Unless you have some dehibilitating, degenerative, terminal finger-disease you will quickly discover that these keys are some of the most comfortable, responsive, even satisfying buttons you have ever pressed. And by \\"satisfying\\" I mean, whenever you press one your finger will go down with a nice, rich feel and a glorious \\"tap\\" sound will emerge. The depth of the keys simply defines them for your fingers to find their way around more easily and in no way affects their responsiveness. It is not at all like one of ye olde timey keyboards that you had to mash down on to get anything going.    6) Thumbstick Hard to Press  Another criticism you will find commonly thrown at this thing is that the joystick is hard to press down.I agree with these points. The joystick is extremely hard to press down. About the only thing I would use it for were switching between walking/running modes or following someone, stuff you don't do all the time.    7) Thumbstick \\"loose\\" Feeling  I've heard it said that the joystick is kind of floppy and cheap feeling. That is entirely subjective. Yes, it is very easy to push around, but I never would have thought of it as \\"floppy\\" or \\"cheap\\" without hearing it.    8) Thumstick not Analog  Honestly I'm not sure exactly what this means, but I have read the thread on the Logitech forums on this topic and they released a patch that enables you to put the joystick in \\"joystick mode\\" which, I presume, was the solution since nobody posted about it after that.    9) Thorny Thumbstick  My main complaint with the thumbstick is that it is just not comfortable. If you look carefully you will see it is shaped like a little tower. Correct that impression, it is shaped like a thorn and feels like it, too. You can't really control it from above like a console stick, and it does take getting used to for this reason. BUT it is entirely worth it to be able to move just with your thumb and free up all your other fingers and mouse for actions and targeting and so forth.    10) Weak Game-recognition  Lots of people are having trouble getting it recognize games and give them an automatic key mapping for their games. This is true. It has yet to find one game on my computer. BUT, the one game it did find provided an absolutely ludicrous mapping setup. So basically, my question is, why would want it to automatically map game for you? As far as I'm concerned automatic keymapping is a silly idea in the first place. Assigning your own keys the way you want them is the best way to learn what all your keys are mapped to and ensuring that you can play the way that is most efficient for you. Everybody will want slightly different mappings.    11) Installation/Stability Issues  Another problem people are having is just getting the thing to install and remember profiles. Most of these people are using Mac systems, which I don't use, so you should probably be concerned if you are trying to install this on a mac. The people with Windows OSs that complain about the software must just have had very little experience with anything computer related. I found, and the majority of reviewers I've read, the software to be extremely intuitive and easy to use. You select the key you want, you tell what you want it to do, you click okay, you're done. Macros are fantasticaly easy as well. As for losing profiles and such, I have had no problems whatsoever. I make a profile, I map it, and it's there whenever I want it from then on.    12) No In-game Profile-switching  One guy mentioned that he wanted to switch profiles in-game but couldn't. First off, you've got THREE instantly switchable key maps for EVERY profile you make using the above-top-row keys just below the LCD. True, you will not be using these on the fly and will probably (*gasp*) have to look at them to switch, but if anybody needs more than 3 sets of 22 keys for any given game, they have something set up entirely wrong. I never need any more than the first set of 22 keys.    13) LCD Weaknesses  Speaking of the LCD, lots of people have complaints aimed at that. Some people can't get it working, some say it's too small, some say it's just useless, some say it's not bright enough, some say they can't see it at certain angles, and some even say it's too bright (as I remember). My experience is this: yes, it's gimicky, but it has it's uses and works well at what it does. What does it do? Pretty much anything. All the applets that were written for the G15 LCD will work with the G13. You can do anything from manage music to display in-game vitals (the latter of which seems super-pointless to me, but the LCD likes to do it automatically anyway). I use it for two things, mainly: keeping track of the time and monitoring my internals (of my PC, not my biological ones...). I found the screen very easily viewable for both these purposes and except for my GPU internals (for which I had to get an applet) CPU, RAM, and clock applets came with the device.    14) Only One Brightness Level  Some people complain that there's only one brightness setting for the keys, but, honestly, why would want more when the one it has does its job perfectly. I can see every key clearly and at a glance. Why would I want to start screwing around with it myself? I would, in all probability, simply get haywired and go back to the default anyway. It's like messing with the gamma/brightness/contrast settings in games. You end up just wanting to switch back to the defaults in the end.    15) Short Cord  I read one reivewer who said the thing has a \\"cripplingly short cord.\\" Obviously he was trying to play at a \\"cripplingly long distance\\" from his computer. The cord has got be at least five feet long. It's more than enough to comfortably play it on the left of your monitor with the computer set on the right side of your desk.    16) Learning Curve  The final, and most legitimate, criticism I've heard is that the G13 has a learning curve, and I agree, basically. It does have a learning curve. The key-rows are lined up with one another, not staggered wildly like on a keyboard, and you do have to memorize which keys do what (which I why I recommend setting up all key-mappings yourself from scratch rather than use the silly pre-made ones). However, this learning curve depends entirely on the individual. For me, the learning curve was very mild, but it may take longer for others. I can't speak for them. What I can vouch for (and what you will find said in other reviews) is that once you get used to it, the G13 becomes second nature. At this point, I've almost entirely forgotten that I'm using controllers at all. It all just comes instinctively after a few hours, and then you start simply putting your will in action fluidly, effortlessly, and continuously.    17) Size  A number of people have mentioned that the G13 takes up a lot of desk space. Yes, it does have a hearty footprint. About the size of a size-10 shoe I'd say, but nobody has mentioned yet that it takes up way less room than a keyboard. A G13/mouse combo is infinitely more portable than a keyboard/mouse combo. Now, you may say, \\"I still need my keyboard for chatting, so what we're really talking about is a G13/keyboard/mouse combo.\\" Yes and no. Because your keyboard is only used for chatting, it no longer needs to be instantly accessible. In my case, I now have the keyboard up on the desk while I lounge back like a console-gamer in my chair with my keyboard-tray removed from my desk and sitting across my lap comfortably holding my G13 on the left and my mouse on the right. When I need to chat, I simply lean forward and type my message real quick and then flop back in my chair and keep playing. I could never do that with a mouse and keyboard because, first of all, my hand would have to be cramped up in front of my stomach to work the keyboard right and second, my lap-desk would have to be skewed way off to the right to get the mouse out far enough to be in a usable position. With the G13 and mouse my hands just rest easily to my right and left. If I weren't killing things I would probably fall asleep it's so cozy.      Conclusion:  So, is it worth 80 bucks? No. Is it worth 50? Maybe. It really depends on what you do and how much of it you do. If you are a hardcore MMO-er, then I would say it's worth it absolutely. Otherwise, do what I did: wait for it to go on sale and buy it with the gift card you got last Christmas. The G13 has totally changed the way I game. I no longer feel like I'm \\"manipulating\\" anything. I feel like I'm playing the piano and the game is responding to my every whim. I'm virtually unconscious of my controls now, they are \\"transparent\\" if you will.
B000E1ZBIQ|5.0|This performance is absolutely wonderful, although I confess that I prefer to LISTEN to it without WATCHING it.  The singers are top-notch, as is the orchestra.  But, it is something of a distraction to see Eva Marton cast as Maddalena, and Jose Carreras as her \\"leading man.\\"  I don't mean to be cruel by this, but Jose is a little on the short side and Eva a little too large.  Plus, the stage props are somewhat distracting at times.  Thus, I just LISTEN to the wonderful music and performances on this DVD.  I should mention that Piero Cappuccilli is also great in this performance--his 2-minute audience ovation in Act III is evidence of this.
0060899220|5.0|I was unsure what to expect from this book, but I found it very entertaining with some wonderful annecdotes. And for all of his bravado and ego, you also see a good deal of humility in him, particularly in some of the latter chapters. I think the book could have been better organized perhaps, but it never really bothered me, and I was always engrossed in it and turning the pages.
0307266303|3.0|I usually avoid a book of this type because it elicits my barf-reflex.  This is a book that blends Christopher McDougall's search for a way to cure his aching running feet with the sociology of a bunch of socially backward Mexicans called the Tarahumara indians. McDougall throws in a bunch of really impressive anthropologists and running coaches and stirs up a vat full of controversy about the true nature of human physiology:   Running=The natural engine of human evolution.  This book utilizes the breathless writing style we might call: Runner's Porno.  It reminds me of all the tiresome writing we might call \\"airport prose\\", that deathly, easy swoon towards large profits that lesser writers succumb to,on their way to the nursing home.   Chris McDougall writes as a true believer. He runs,he writes, he runs some more.   When you stop and think about this book,with a writer's eye, you imagine twenty or thirty dusty spiral squirrelly notebooks, feathered with sticky Post-it notes. This book is a fine effort of journalism. The breezy Oprah-talky-ness put me off.  A fine effort.  Yet annoying.
B001GCUO52|1.0|absolutely, the worst.<br />how didn't this go straight to DVD?<br />seriously.<br />nothing new, except the 3D.<br />big whoop.
B002QP145C|2.0|Oh boy, this is what I get for reading other people's recommendations for \\"best World War II movies\\".<br /><br />First of all, if you must watch this movie, DO NOT get this uncut version.  I'm not sure what the 70 minutes were that got put back into this movie, but the movie is way too slow and long.  The first disc goes over halfway before we see any war action.  There's just lots of scenes of soldiers talking to each other.<br /><br />The war scenes are ... flawed.  The actors don't act like soldiers, they act like actors, who have never handled weapons before.  Most of the battles are against hoards of Soviet soldiers launching themselves in these \\"Hoorah!\\" charges, often accompanied by these BT tanks.<br /><br />The BT tanks do look pretty realistic, so the 2 stars are for the BT tanks.<br /><br />What I couldn't figure out was how the Soviets lost these battles.  We see the Soviet forces vastly outnumber the Finns, we see them charging in large numbers right to the Finnish trenches, which are manned by only a few brave Finnish soldiers firing one shot at a time with these excruciatingly sluggish bolt action rifles (and the actors seem to struggle with them - surely these bolt actions were not that sticky and slow in real life?), as well as a few submachine guns.  Very little artillery or tripod mounted machine guns and no mortars with which to repel the Soviets.  The Soviet soldiers look like they are going to overwhelm the Finns,  and then miraculously, in a sharp cut to the next scene, the Finns are celebrating a victory.  Huh?  More missing minutes of film?<br /><br />And it just went on and on like that.  Never could figure out the plot, nor who got killed and who still lived at the end of this film... and I didn't really care either.  Thank goodness for the fast forward button.
0786868724|3.0|When i first read reviews on this book i was super pumped about reading it.  It ended up almost satisfying my craving, but it was like eating a biscuit without gravy: really good but could be so much better.  It was a very nice story though and i enjoyed it.  Three stars...

B00005JM02|3.0|Finding Nemo is a visual feast, the sound is exciting and fresh and both serve to draw you into the undersea world of Finding Nemo.  From any other animation studio, this film would have earned an enthusiastic 5/5 stars.  Compared to other Pixar films, though, the story and emotions just don't have the same impact as the Toy Stories, Ratatouille, or The Incredibles.    Son Nemo and father Marlin are the only surviving members of a clownfish family, living on the edge of a beautiful coral reef.  Marlin is especially protective of Nemo and when his first day of school goes disasterously wrong - Nemo is captured by a diver and placed in a salt-water fish tank - Marlin vows to find and rescue Nemo.  What follows is a series of adventures that Marlin and Dorie (a friend met along the way) survive on their quest.    As mentioned, the visuals are fantastic, and the animation of the various sea animals is well-visioned.  It's always a tricky business to anthropomorphise non-mammalian creatures, but these fish (and turtles starfish, etc.) are both clearly the aquatic species they represent and clearly emote human feelings.  The voice acting is, as expected for a Pixar film, fantastic, with perfectly envisioned characters voiced by Albert Brooks (as Marlin), Willem Dafoe (as a fellow aquarium prisoner willing to risk Nemo's life for a chance for them all to escape), and a flock of seagulls, whose only word is \\"Mine\\".  My favourite scene is that depicted on the box of this 2-disc special edition - a surfer dude turtle (\\"Don't hurl on the shell, man, I just had it waxed!\\") who shows Marlin the way to Sydney Harbour, last known location of the boat into which Nemo was abducted.    For a casual viewer, there is a lot of adventure and visual surprises to entertain and delight anyone of any age.  However, for the average parent forced to watch repeated viewings of their obsessive child's movie-of-the-moment, it doesn't hold up as well on repeated viewings.  First, the ditzy Dorrie's forgetfulness wears thin.  Secondly, the structure of the film is a sequence of one set-piece action scene after another, and it gets repetative.  Young viewers, of course, will not notice either of these criticisms and, if my 4.5-year-old is any indication, will want to watch the film again and again.  (Curse you Pixar! If my son doesn't get enough exercise it's your fault!)    This 2-disc edition has some nifty extras, although not as many as the Incredibles or Toy Story's special editions.  Perhaps the most amusing is a short mocumentary where Jean-Michel Cousteau tries to explain the ecosystem of a coral reef and Dorrie and Marlin keep interrupting (\\"Zis would never have happened to Papa....\\")  Other highlights are the deleted/alternate versions of scenes and the director's commentary, which is more interesting and informative than the standard commentary.
B00004XMTJ|1.0|What started out as something cute: the cute cat costumes with the clever cat-themed rhymes in the songs winds up being way overdone--2 full hours of this?!  Please, only a psychotically-disturbed obsessed-compulsive cat-lover could enjoy that much of an overdose of this.  It's way too much of basically the same stuff over and over and over again.  The Webber tune \\"memory,\\" which is sung several times, is enchanting, but doesn't overcome the sheer boredom of the production taken as a whole enough to deserve 2 stars for this DVD.
B000002J29|4.0|4 1/2    Still strong enough to be a prime example of art-rock performance at its absolute finest, besides from offering stunningly accurate renditions of mid-career classics the band brings out enough vitality in these performances so as to surpass many of the flatter originals.
B0026P3G12|3.0|My hat's off to Susan Boyle. She has character, an incredible voice, and quiet charm.  I like her. I love her voice and I can't stand half of this album. It bored me to tears. What a disappointing collection of songs.<br /><br />Here's what I'd love to hear: more sultry songs like \\"Cry Me a River\\" which she nails, a revival of some Judy Garland songs...and perhaps an album of Andrew Lloyd Weber songs like \\"Only You\\" from Starlight Express, anything from Phantom of the Opera, some Broadway hits to let her belt 'em out, and so on. I hope the song pickers do a much better job next time... they really did a poor job. So<br /> 5 stars for Susan... but 2 stars for the song pickers and producer.

006176759X|2.0|Lauren Conrad's departure from The Hills coincided with my departure from watching The Hills.  Why?  Because after Lauren left, the show took on a weird Jerry Springer quality.  Who wants to watch Kristin Cavallari swearing like a sailor as she walks around dressed in her sleaziest ensemble?  The rest of the cast is just as bad.  Audrina is a space cadet.  Brody's only claim to fame are his famous parents.  And Heidi and Spencer?  There are no words for them.  Or none that I am willing to write on this PG-rated blog anyway.<br /><br />I was never an avid fan of The Hills but of the episodes I did watch, Lauren was always the classy, stylish, and articulate one.  I think she is quite pretty as well - I have seen her several times here in Los Angeles and she looks better in her sweats than I do all decked out!  Sad but true.  Anyway, I have to admire her tenacity for turning her 15 minutes of fame into a respectable business.  She is quite a role model for the MTV crowd and God knows they need someone other than the cast of Jersey Shore.<br /><br />I really, really wanted to like this book, but a few pages into the story I nearly relegated the book to my 4-year-old so she decorate it with pretty pictures.  It was only because of some weird sense of responsibility that I forced myself to push through.  Nobody can say that I am a quitter!<br /><br />While L.A. Candy is marketed as fiction, it is really a semi-autobiographical account of Lauren's experiences in Hollywood and her subsequent rise to fame. In the book, fictional characters Jane and Scarlett take the place of Lauren and Heidi. These two best friends move to Los Angeles from Santa Barbara and immediately immerse themselves in all things Hollywood. Jane decides to postpone college and instead takes a job working for renowned, but difficult event planner Fiona Chen. Scarlett begins her freshman year at USC and starts sleeping her way through the city. They live in a rundown apartment and have very little money to spare but are thrilled with the adventure they are about to embark on.<br /><br />One day Jane and Scarlett run into producer Trevor Lord from PopTV who chooses them to star in his new reality show L.A. Candy.  Every girl's dream right?  But as soon as the cameras start to roll Jane and Scarlett learn more about the reality of reality television.  Their days revolve around filming schedules, hidden microphones, staged dates, and fake relationships and Jane and Scarlett find themselves questioning their newly scripted lives.  Jealousy flares as Jane's rise as television's newest star leaves her co-stars Gaby and Madison green with envy leading to a scandal changes Jane's life forever.  The book ends abruptly, forcing anyone interested in the adventures of Jane and Scarlett to go out and purchase book number two of Lauren's three book deal.<br /><br />Lauren is a very talented girl, but she is not a writer.  I believe this book is being marketed for the Young Adult crowd but honestly, even my 15-year-old cousin could have done a better job developing the characters and putting together real world dialogue.  The writing is very elementary...i.e. \\"That would be super-fun!\\"  Or the ubiquitous, \\"Gag!\\" and \\"'Kay!\\"  For any Young Adults out there I would stick to the Gossip Girl series which is not just more realistic but well written as well.<br /><br />There was one positive in a sea of negatives though - the book gave some interesting insight into the filming of a reality TV show.  Who knew that producers often order several takes when the cast leaves a restaurant because of camera locations?  I also had no idea that \\"being miked\\" is such a huge undertaking.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|I cannot believe there is such a number of great reviews for this film! After watching it I had nothing but questions: have people's tastes really fallen so low? Did the director, being an experienced and talented man, really think he accomplished something great with this? Am I wrong by not enjoying it at all when everybody around me does?<br /><br />I haven't been so bored watching a film for a long time. Granted, the effects were spectacular (and my only star goes exclusively to them)! from the very first scene I knew almost exactly what was going to happen in the rest of the film. Since I heard the story about that big orange bird I couldn't help but waited when the protagonist was going to ride it. It was crystal clear from the start that the bad military men and greedy businessmen were going to try and ruin the planet and the good guy will save it (turning into an avatar himself and, of course, reuniting with his beloved) but not without some sacrifice on the good people's side. There was no surprise whatsoever at all! There was nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing interesting. I will never bring back those 3 hours of my life!<br /><br />I cannot believe film professionals really think that nowadays this is enough for a film just to have some very special effects and virtually nothing more. Turns out they are right considering all the raving reviews and crowds of people going to the cinemas. What a depressing thought!......

0061733199|4.0|I bought this book about 6 months ago.. When I got it on my hands, I started reading it but I found it to be tiring to just read it as a ordinary book. Basically it went to a drawer and stayed there for quite a while. Sometime later I picked it up again when I tought I would need to learn how to make knots, and then I found it pretty good. After that I started to work on the traps chapter, and so on. Now, I almost went through the entire book and learned a lot.    Basically I understood that if you want to read it, go for it. You will probably get tired quickly. If you want to learn from it, go peacefully and practicing everything you read (if possible, of course.. I dont think you will practice on how to skin an animal in your TV room).    I dont know if such difficulty was due to the language (english is not my mother language) or what, but I just can't agree with some reviews saying it is confusing or anything like that. Maybe I tried to read this book the wrong way for this kind of book. It is pretty well organized and written, and the pictures and drawings can really help. I'm no expert, but I dont think anyone can make it much better than this when teaching someone to make a more complicated knot (the only better place I found on knots is a website with animated images to show how to make the knots, but that is not possible in a book, so far).    I cant give less than 4 stars to this book. As said, I'm no expert, but definitively, it can help you a lot in a tough situation. Enjoy!
B00004TRD8|4.0|Whether you get the two-disc set or the rare single-disc DVD-18, T2 Ultimate Edition is a wonderful film school in and of itself! The only thing that would have made it sweeter is if they'd included the Guns 'n' Roses music video for \\"You Could Be Mine\\" which was on the three-disc Pioneer laserdisc box set - here all we get are still photos from the video. (There are also a couple of audio Easter eggs on the three-disc laserdisc set: one in which if you play through all the chapter menus, you'll hear Arnold say, \\"I have detailed files\\", and the other in which if you press Play on the LD player instead of step through the script, you'll see the animation and T2 music play through from the main title credits.) It's one of the best DVDs ever!
079073639X|4.0|Are you ever bothered when a person does not answer a question you ask? How about if they don't even acknowledge your existence like your presence is void? This feeling of which I meditate upon is exhibited by Dustin Hoffman's character in \\"Sphere\\" perfectly after his crew mates start going into \\"The Sphere\\" one after another. To truly enjoy this film, put yourself in the shoes of Dustin Hoffman, who is accompanied by other researchers but who is essentially alone once his compatriots are mentally transformed into simpler humans. The one crew member who has these effects down to a T is Samuel L. Jackson whose transformation is drastic from the well-mannered scientist to the overly happy crew member who almost becomes more of a liability than an asset to the crew. All the while monsters are aloof, striking at the crew in various awful ways. And if that's not great enough, just the idea of Queen Latiffa being killed by sea monsters just makes my funny bone tingle, hilarious. I say see this film, it is an enjoyable watch and certainly an eyebrow-raiser of the scientific sorts.<br /><br />P.S.- Did anyone else really want to read 20,000 Leagues under the sea really badly after watching this film?

I've played guitar in bar bands myself for over 30 yrs., and I've seen and heard Hendrix, Clapton, Beck, Satriani, Trower and many others, all of whom I love. But I'll tell you what: nobody played with more soul and authority as Roy. I saw him play live many times. This, his first album, is but a mere taste of what he was capable of, but it's still a fine, fine album. \\"Sweet Dreams\\" alone is worth the price of admission.

B0007CNXUK|1.0|Marc Forster's \\"Finding Neverland\\" (2004) is a perfect example of why Hollywood needs a moral makeover and a realignment of its spiritual compass.  The protagonist, Sir James Matthew Barrie (Johnny Depp), is played as a romantic hero, a champion of youth and childhood innocence. In reality he was an immature husband who cheated on his wife, a failed playwright, and a possible pedophile.  To soothe his troubled conscience, Depp's Sir James Barrie pursues a young widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her four sons.  As scandalous rumors begin to spread regarding Barrie's conduct, several characters, including Barrie's friends, his wife Mary Ansel (Radha Mitchell), and Sylvia's mother, Mrs. Emma du Maurier (Julie Christie), try to curb his involvement with the Llewelyn Davies family.  This seems to have the only effect of driving Barrie into more frequent contact with them.   The end result of Barrie's pursuit rings hollow.  Instead of cherishing his wife and building his family, Barrie loses Mary to another man.  Sylvia, the woman he was having an emotional affair with, ends up dying.  Equally tragic, \\"Neverland,\\" the symbolic essence of Barrie's vision, passion, and dreams, is never shared with his wife Mary Ansel and is only incompletely and imperfectly shared with his mistress Sylvia.      Barrie's relationship with the four boys is also heartbreaking.  As a man he seems unable to give them wise counsel or to provide them with a good role model.  To the boys Barrie comes off as an older playmate, but their deepest fear is that he will try to replace their recently deceased but loving father.  In the film Barrie never is able to do more than get the boys to play and use their imagination, and in the end his only advice to the now orphaned children is to pretend that their mother is there.  \\"...in fact, she is, because she's on every page of your imagination. You'll always have her there. Always. ...And you can visit her any time you like if you just go there yourself. ...By believing, ...Just believe.\\"  That Barrie ends up as the children's co-guardian is frightening.  That Sir Barrie never seems to have matured is amply demonstrated by the child Peter Llewelyn Davies (Freddie Highmore) when he states in the film, \\"I'm not Peter Pan,\\" then points to Barrie and exclaims, \\"He is.\\"  Johnny Depp's Sir James Matthew Barrie proves to indeed be this immature man who never seems to have grown up and lived in his own fantasy land.    There is nothing in this film that makes me want to recommend it.

B000MXPE7O|5.0|I have to give an argument to the official Amazon review of this movie.  This is one of my favorite movies right now.  It shows what is so great about this country, that men and women with everything going for them are willing to sacrifice everything to do a thankless job.  The whole point of Damon's character is to show how cold and calculated every move has to be when working in the world of espionage.  It's not that they did not want to develop a character in a story, it shows the real world consequences of basically leading a double life.  So whoever this guy is that wrote the review for Amazon needs to check which country he lives in and thank the people like Matt Damon's character that protect them without ever wanting anything, especially a thank you, because they love this country.

Steve Krugs gives advice on avoiding common usabilities issues.<br />With that, here are a few things I picked up.<br />- Test rather than argue with your team.<br />- Users read in a hurry, so kill the noise by having less design and small talk, while filling the page up with unique content.<br />- Avoiding ads on your home page, even though it has the highest traffic.<br />- Provide aid for lost users. That includes a way to get to the home page, a site id, and other means of understanding their location.<br />- Test each stage of your project at least once. The earlier the testing, the cheaper to repair.
B00006H67C|2.0|An album of undeniable historical importance, Free Jazz is also not likely to be one you'll listen to often. It inspired, and continues to inspire, countless great recordings of collective improvisations, including a number of far greater albums that followed immediately in its wake in the 1960s. Sun Ra's Magic City (and his other experiments in conduction), John Coltrane's Ascension (and Live in Seattle), Albert Ayler's New York Eye and Ear Control, and Peter Brotzmann's Machine Gun are all more spiritually searching, musically soaring and just plain searing experiences, and, while Ornette deserves all the props for doing it first, you can hear all the musicians on Free Jazz concentrating too hard as they try to make their solo statements or comment on what the other players are doing. It's all a bit tentative compared to what would come later, and, as a maelstrom, it's all rather polite. Interestingly, Eric Dolphy's bass clarinet comes off as the dominant and most confident voice. He's seems to have been born to channel some sort of ineffable cry from the soul, and it's no wonder that Coltrane wanted to be near him.

006621131X|3.0|....  After all, I don't like Patti Smith and I loathe the leprous Robert Mapplethorpe (who bears a striking resemblance to the English murderer, Patrick Mackay).  Smith, Mapplethorpe, and others of that ilk are considered (and view themselves as) artists in a world gone mad, where art has become so degraded, decadent, and degenerate that it can no longer be deemed art at all.  But pick up \\"Just Kids\\" I did.  And I was pleasantly surprised.  Though totally devoid of insight, the book is well written, evocative, and frequently poignant.    And I was delighted that my old friend, Ruth Kligman, was briefly mentioned.  Well I remember the days when I used to take her out for mussels and Belgian fries.  It made up for Smith's egregious mistake in writing that a Jesuit's priestly garb is brown, when it is in fact black.    Reluctantly recommended.

They're completely wireless.(although you have to connect it to your controller to chat on xbox live, which is not a big deal since your going to have the controller in your hands anyway) No messy wires.  It does give you an edge on gaming and you can hear the slightest sound in movies and the bass is superb.  It has good battery life, I dare to say that I squeeze 12-15 hours of juice out of my rechargeable AAA's.      The  Neutral =    It is said that other wireless devices interfere with the headset but I haven't had any trouble with my wireless router that's 8 ft from the transmitter, if you have a radioactive house with all kinds of waves and frequencies running through it may cause some problems.  I cannot say how the product support from turtle beach is because I haven't had to use it so far.      The Negative -    As you probably have heard, there are cracking and static sounds once in a while but its mostly when the battery is low and can be fixed by swapping batteries for a freshly charged pair.  You can only use the chat feature on Xbox, although turtle beach sells components to make it work with PS3 and PC's.(keep in mind the headset gets sound from them, its just the chat feature)       A little advise, get an extra optical cable for your PS3 or other component so you can easily swap between them and connect the usb cable to the tv to power the transmitter.

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Okay, so I am not a diehard Britney Spears fan, but there was a time when she dominated the radio waves and really stood out as a relevant and fun pop star.  Sure, she had her rough spot, but I'm really happy for her to be back on top.  `In the Zone' is probably one of her better known albums, for it features a few of her biggest hits (`Toxic' still being one of the best things she's ever done).  Upon reflection there is a lot to like here, and while it has a few mediocre tracks, and even two or three abysmal ones, the good far outweighs the bad.<br /><br />With heavy beats, provocative lyrics and influences that range from hip-hop to reggae to rock, `In the Zone' represents some of the best of Spears.<br /><br />The album opens with a smash.  `Me Against the Music' is fun, catchy and memorable.  Pairing Spears with Madonna was pretty ingenious, and they play off one another beautifully.  The closing remix of this track is just as catchy and just as amazing.  `Outrageous' is also a lot of fun.  Britney finds good footing in the world of slick hip-hop beats and seductive vocals.  She allows the Ying-Yang twins to grace her presence on `Boom Boom' and they give her a taste of southern hospitality.  The pairing is inspired and it works gloriously.<br /><br />Who would have ever thought Britney could hold her own like that?<br /><br />I love the reggae influence on `The Hook Up'.  It really has that `hook' that keeps you entertained.  Her smooth chemistry with the rhythm is very enticing.  I like the sensuality she layers on tracks like `Early Mornin' and `Breathe on Me', even if both tracks lack a little something.  They have this undeniable caress, but there is also an air of stagnancy that leaves me feeling as though something were missing.<br /><br />`Shadow' and `Brave New Girl' are fine, just forgettable.<br /><br />And then we have the best and worst.  The two worst tracks here are `Showdown', which is just plain dull, and `Touch of My Hand', which is so pointless it becomes somewhat trashy.  I don't really like the construction either.  It's uninspired and unflattering.  But, then we have `Everytime' and `Toxic'.  `Everytime' is probably the most emotional and personal song that Britney has done (she even wrote it herself).  Couple that with the stunning music video and you have a shockingly sincere and touching song from Pop's princess.  `Toxic', like I mentioned earlier, is honestly the best thing she has ever done.  The beat is sic, the whole vibe is entrancing and absorbing and so much fun.  This is one of those songs that just never grows old.<br /><br />I'm addicted to that song!<br /><br />So, in the end I have to say that this is a very solid pop album, one that would make any fan of the genre or the artist very, very happy.like the construction either.

If you like those bands you will eventually have listened to all of their music and you don't get anymore.  Well here you have your chance for some new music!  And I enjoyed every song on the deluxe Cosmic Egg the first time I listened to them, which is rare for me.  Maybe it's because all the songs are like other songs I enjoy (and I'm not saying they are/n't) or maybe they're just good music, but regardless of why, the fact remains the same: this album makes my ears happy.

The choice of material was poor, in  my opinion, and it is sort of Johnny One Note -- Not one upbeat or happy song in the whole lineup.  Daydream Believer is not a funeral dirge.  Her version of Wild Horses made me long for the Rolling Stones.  There were two hymns -- one would have sufficed.  Of course, her showstopper \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is included, but with overbearing orchestrations on this and other songs.  Let the woman sing, for heaven's sake! I won't be listening again and again because it gets annoying to hear the solemn songs all the way through.

1572815612|5.0|The Universal Waite Tarot deck, re-colored by Mary Hanson-Roberts is based off of the Original Waite Tarot Deck. I haven't used to Original deck, but I have used the Universal deck. However, I have Googled images of the two decks, and I prefer the look of the Universal Deck. The images seem to be more vibrant, and more energetic.<br /><br />The Universal Waite Tarot Deck is a great deck to buy as a first deck. The cards have enough images to give a general meaning with enough detail to allow you to interpret more. However, the cards aren't so detailed that they become overwhelming to look at for the first time. Now, whether you will prefer the Original or Universal Rider Waite, I can't say. The best advice I can give readers is to Google images of both decks, and see which you prefer.<br /><br />Now there are a few packages of this deck you can buy. I have seen the deck sold by itself, and a package with both the deck and a book written by Arthur Edward Waite, and a tarot spread sheet. I haven't used the spread sheet much, and the book I haven't read at all really. The beginning of the book is a history about Tarot, and the rest of the book is about the meanings of all the cards.<br /><br />I would only suggest getting the deck by itself. It will save you the money of buying the complete set. The deck comes with a small 35 page book that gives the meaning of all the cards. The additional book is more for readers who want a history of tarot. However, just to warn you, it is a little bit of dry reading.

B002HJ9PTO|3.0|The Audio-Technica ATR-35S lavaliere microphone is a higher than average quality microphone. The benefits of the microphone are that the small microphone can clip onto a shirt, or tie with the provided clip. The battery compartment and on/off switch has an additional clip on it to attach to your belt, or pant waist.<br /><br />The overall sound quality for the microphone is astounding considering the price, averaging at about $25, often times less. The material used to fabricate the microphone feels sturdy, and that it will last. Overall I'm extremely happy with the quality of the sound, and the microphone itself. The 20 foot cord helps when you are walking around a room, with the recorder set on a table. Granted, just be sure not to walk too far, as to not pull the recorder off the table. However, I do have a few minor complaints.<br /><br />When I use this microphone with my voice recorder, I always feed the microphone through my shirt, and have my recorder in my pocket. When feeding 20 feet of cord through your shirt, it often times will get tangled, and will feel uncomfortable under your shirt. What I normally do with the extra cord is tie it off with a piece of Velcro. That way, you only have to feed a small bundle of cord through your shirt, rather than 20 feet of loose cord.<br /><br />The last compliant I have is a major one, and there really isn't anything that can be done to fix it. On the battery compartment, there is no way of knowing how much battery life is left, or if it's even still working. There's only an on and off switch, that's it. Not a red light when it's on or a battery indicator. If you begin recording, you need to be sure you will have enough of a battery life to complete the recording.<br /><br />There are two options to help with this, but not solve it.  Either always start each session with a new battery, or record in short sessions. The battery required are the small flat batteries, used in watches, laser pointers, etc, and are inexpensive. What I recommend is to replace the battery after a day of sessions. The second option is that after each session, listen back, and make sure everything was recorded. When doing this, it's best to record shorter sessions, in case you should happen to lose anything due to the battery dying.<br /><br />This is a major hassle though having to do this. I would much rather have a battery light indicator and not have to deal with this.  Highly recommend that when you are looking for a microphone, either find one that doesn't require batteries, or, one that has a battery indicator. For this product, I give 3 out 5 stars. 3 stars for the sound quality, and taking of 2 for the battery issues.replace the battery after a day of sessions.

B001UV4XWY|5.0|At the risk of seeming unpopular, I'll go out on a limb here and say, I really really liked this movie.   Now...having said that...let me back up...    I really liked Donnie Darko - even though I still dont know whats going on.  I really like James Marsden (Cameron baby - if its gonna make Jimmy happy - PRESS WHATEVER BUTTON HE TELLS YOU)  I really like Frank Langella  I went into this not knowing anything about it and tend to be able to go with the flow of most movies.    Richard Kelly will probably not be happy about this comparison, as I bet he wasn't thinking anything along these lines...but I thought the movie was as close to anything \\"Hitchcock-ian\\" as I've seen in years!  Just the right amount of suspense, mixed with thrills, mixed with humor, mixed with interesting characters, in situations well beyond their control - (at least it was out of control AFTER they pressed the d*mn button!)  A lot of the twists I NEVER saw coming - and i'm usually pretty good at figuring that kind of thing out!  The background music was probably what I found most \\"Hitchcock-like\\".  Take a listen to it and then watch say, Psycho, or Vertigo!   Not giving any specific recommendation (I never do that) but if you have the time and inclination, give it a chance.  You can't go wrong with Langella and crew.
076532413X|4.0|I was enjoying much about the television show, and then found out that the basis for the show was this book in science fiction. I'm not a publisher or someone who bases their opinion on the English grammar of the book. I never even noticed the overuse of doubtless...the story was what really concerned me. I read a lot. I read poetry of the romantics and John Donne, Jane Austen, Tolstoy and Tolkien. So I'm familiar with good writers. This book may not be up there with the greats in literature, but it was a very enjoyable read with a basis in science.     The book does deal with free will and determinism, what we can change in our lives. I thought the arguments Sawyer gave were really interesting. He also takes advantage of the great concern about the Haladron Collider which will soon be going online, and doing the very things talked about in the book. Though most people are more concerned about the creation of a small black hole (whether or not it is possible).     Now that I've read the book, I see some similarities in the TV show, but I'm not sure they can tie it all together as neatly as the book does. Besides the fact that there is no one in the book that is 'conscious' during the flashforward. Not sure what they will do with that.     This was in my opinion a more than decent read. It was exciting and had a different premise. I don't mind my fiction teaching me something new in science. Too bad more books do not do that. This isn't a 'mindless' read, the author explains a lot of the science behind this.
0385504225|2.0|I loved the previous two Robert Langdon novels. The hype surrounding this book probably contributed to a let down. The Symbol was a good story, but far from the level of intrigue Dan Brown got us used to. The characters and plot seemed unfresh here. Langdon didn't seem as interesting and there was altogether a lot of lecturing instead of the rich facts contributing to an effective imagination. I'd likely give this book better ratings if the expectations weren't set so high. That said, it's a decent read.
B000KJU1HI|5.0|Being that I am a greater fan of Dylan's acoustical music over his electric, this DVD set was absolutely wonderful for me.<br /><br />The movie itself is nothing short of spectacular. It gives you a great perspective of Dylan as he travels throughout England on his 1965 tour...his last acoustical tour (I do believe). The movie was shot with a small camera giving the least amount of obtrusiveness to Dylan and his fellow friends/bandmembers. The movie captures scenes of concerts, of backstage antics, to parties in hotel rooms.<br /><br />The real gem of this DVD is the commentary by DA Pennebaker and Bob Neuwirth. They give A LOT of insight into the film as well as the events that happened during the 65 tour.<br /><br />There is also a bonus 'documentary' featuring an hour of deleted scenes from 'Don't Look Back'...it is edited in the same form as 'Don't Look Back', but it is only an hour long.<br /><br />The book that comes with it is entertaining. It is not a necessity but a nice bonus. There is also a flip book made from the music video of 'Subterranean Homesick Blues' - again, not a necessity, but a fun item to play with as your waiting for the movie to start.<br /><br />All in all, this DVD set is worth the price.<br /><br />5/5

B00127RAJY|5.0|Love it!  This workout kicks butt and definitely gets results, and all within 20 minutes.  You will work hard, but can't beat it!
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Look this movie is a sci-fi cult classic ...it's just that, plain and simple. Now we all now Keifer Sutherland is not that great of an actor as you can tell by 24. But in this movie, just like The Lost Boys, he finds the character that fits his personality.    If you gave that crappy movie Avatar a chance, then this one deserves your complete attention.    *thank you    -by a real avid movie fan
B002M50WJ0|4.0|Product was in the condition stated and I received it before the delivery time stated. Thanks so much for your prompt service around the heavy mail time at Christmas. I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
1439102813|4.0|This book was an enjoyable read that enlightened me to this disease. The process of how Alice loses her memory and how it is characterized colorized the Alzheimers picture for me. It was a very worthy learning experience and I highly recommend it.
0312360266|5.0|All Zoey Redbird wants is to belong, blend in, be a part of the whole.  It's been a long time since she felt that way at home; she certainly hasn't felt like a part of the family in all the years her mother has been married to `the step-monster.'  Even at her high school, where she gets to spend time with the only people (besides her grandmother) who really care about her, Zoey still feels like an outsider.<br /><br />So it wasn't a big surprise to find out she's a freak, which is exactly how Zoey feels when she gets Marked by a Tracker - delineated as a fledgling vampyre.  Zoey must now join the House of Night, the school where she'll learn all she needs to know about her new life as she grows into an adult vampyre -  if she survives the Change, that is.<br /><br />Even at the House of Night, Zoey feels like a freak. A fledgling for only a few days, she's more advanced in some ways than students who have been there for months, even years. And Zoey discovers she is powerful, blessed by the Goddess Nyx with special abilities.  When she learns that hateful upperclassman Aphrodite, who is also Goddess-blessed, is misusing her gifts, Zoey must decide whether to use her own newfound talents to stand up for what she knows to be right.<br /><br />Marked is a crackling good story and a great introduction to the House of Night series.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I love Jillian Michaels so I thought I'd give this a try. I expected the exercises to be tough but still do-able. I knew I was in trouble when she started with the jumping jacks. I am overweight and I have arthritis in my knees. Jumping jacks are completely out. There are knee bends...and a lot of up and down that take you from a standing position to the floor and back up again. If you have really bad knees like myself there are not alternative movements on this dvd that will keep your knees in the no-pain/no damage zone. After the first work out(the easiest), my knees swole and hurt for over a week. I let one coworker borrow this and she had similar problems with the knees. She is somewhat overweight but not very much. I let another coworker borrow and she was able to do the excercises, although she said they were tough. She is very young though and not at all overweight. So I'd say if you in pretty good condition to start with this DVD may work for you.  If you have bad knees, try another DVD! I'm looking for one myself! Sidenote: The other exercises on this DVD are fine(tough but do-able).
B000JML7EC|4.0|Treasure Island is the best pirate novel I've ever come across.  Although I must also add this is the only pirate novel I've come across.  That being my background, I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it really is a wonderful story. Some of the technical jargon gets confusing, but with the dictionary function on the Kindle it is absolutely a breeze.
B002G1K82Q|1.0|A celebration of the Beatles, but without the Beatles.  Instead you get some actors singing to music track.  You also get the self-important arrogance of the 60s generation (take a look at the title: the \\"Universe,\\" you say?) and \\"insight\\" into the horrors of the Vietnam War comprising gay actors in period battle dress uniform splashing through water.    A truly nolstagic adventure if your pushing or past 60 years of age, a recruiting poster for the GOP for Generation X, etcetera and don't forget that you cannot trust anyone over 30, over 40, over 50, over 60.  Well, you get the idea.
1416955070|5.0|Part of the growing trend toward Urban Fantasy in Young Adult fiction, The Mortal Instruments series is dark, edgy and has more than a few neo-gothic horror overtones.<br /><br />Clary Fray, a seemingly normal teen from Brooklyn, realizes one day (or actually, one evening) at a teen club that she can see things, things that should not be real, that her friends cannot see. In the blink of an eye, Clary is knee deep in a reality that includes demon-hunters (and demons, of course), vampires, warlocks and werewolves - and the truth is that it's the same reality she has lived in all of her life. She just couldn't see it all before because someone or something was preventing her from seeing it.<br /><br />As Clary learns more about the world of the Shadow Hunters (descendants of angels who hunt demons) from an enigmatic boy named Jace, she also discovers the dark secrets of her own family's history and the true nature of her place in the world.<br /><br />This series starts off well with this book, but it really picks up steam with the second and third volumes (City of Ashes and City of Glass, respectively). It takes a bit of time to sort out all the ins and outs of the world and characters the author has created, but it's worth the effort.

B000ICL3KG|5.0|You know people, I'm 53 now and I've been reading all my life about these apocalyptic stories of gloom and doom and not one of these predictions has ever come about. I remember a National Geographic article (1980) that showed that most of the oil fields were going to be drained or mostly gone by the year 2000. And yet the more I learn about our oil reserves its pretty obvious that the media and government are engaged in a conspiracy to lie about how much oil we really have, which by the way is more that Saudi Arabia.   Remember in 1993 when on Larry King Live, Saint Al of the Gore said that NAFTA \\"is a good deal for this country\\", and a $1 billion trade surplus turned into $75 billion trade deficit. Some good deal - thanks a lot Al. Look what happened to Detroit. You think the economy is bad now wait til Cap and Trade kicks in. The end of industrial America. By the way, Al Gore and his partners own the company you'll pay your carbon offsets too, Al stands to make billions.  Go ahead and watch it, but when watch 'The Great Global Warming Swindle' and compare. Ask yourself \\"Which one makes more sense?\\". Especially after this winter. Hell people, it snowed the other day in Australia -AND ITS SUMMER DOWN THERE!!!!!
B0029358GM|3.0|Tweedy has not written a really engaging melody on this record (although You and I comes close), but the band, the arrangements, and everything else that makes sounds like Wilco in top form. But the only difference between most these songs are the arrangements and the lyrics; the chords and melodies are just swapped around leading to a wall of sameness by the time the CD is over. I loved the first four Wilco records, they were filled with songs I could hum and \\"Sky Blue Sky\\" had its moments, but here Tweedy appears to be coasting on his laurels.
B002QW7ALM|3.0|Science fiction movies have taken the public by storm year after year. The current top grossing film of the year AVATAR is proof of that. And yet there are many smaller sci fi films that get less attention but are picked up by fans of the genre. Such is the case with PANDORUM.<br /><br />In the future space is running out, populations are growing and a new home for humans needs to be found. Enter the space ship Elysium and its crew. Setting off to find a new planet we can inhabit, the crew is placed in cryogenic sleep waking in rotating shifts to make sure things run smoothly. Along for the ride and asleep are some 60,000 passengers.<br /><br />Waking for their shift is Bower (Ben Foster), reeling from temporary loss of memory and shakes, a part of the waking process. Bower dresses and then wakes his supervisor Payton (Dennis Quaid). Unable to access the ship's bridge, Bower climbs up and begins crawling through the ventilation ducts while Payton gives him guidance via the ship's computers.<br /><br />While Bower travels the shaft, Payton talks to him about pandorum, a psychological condition brought about by long term cryogenic hibernation and space travel. Symptoms include paranoia, hallucinations, shakes and homicidal tendencies. Now along with the natural dangers onboard, the duo have to hope they don't fall victim to this condition.<br /><br />A fall down a shaft lands Bower in another portion of the ship. Here he is able to access a different tunnel and moving through it he encounters another human being awake. But Nadia (Antje Traue) doesn't appear to be normal. Dirty and disheveled, she seems to be living at wits end, avoiding something yet unseen but not for long. More of a warrior woman than crew member, Nadia resists helping Bower at first, then begins educating him to how things have changed. The first change is a group of blue skinned mutants tracking down the pair in an attempt to capture them.<br /><br />Communication between Bower and Payton has been shot when Bower landed on his com link. On his own, Bower enlists Nadia's help and another person he comes across in an attempt to get to the ships main reactor. The cycle of the reactor calls for it to shut down every so often and in so doing prevent the ship from full power capacity. Along the way Bower and his group are hunted by the blue creatures that we discover are a cannibalistic bunch who view them as the blue plate special.<br /><br />In the meantime, Payton finds another crew member as well, arriving in the area we began in and in bad shape. Gallo (Cam Gigandet) seems to be in shock. Or is it the first stages of pandorum? Only time will tell and a verbal cat and mouse game between Gallo and Payton begins.<br /><br />The action in the film jumps back and forth between the two stories, Bower in a more adventurous mode that becomes more physical as he tries to reach the reactor while being hunted. The other tale is of Payton and Gallo as each one attempts to outmaneuver the other in their verbal sparring. While Bower's path seems the most dangerous, the one followed by Payton revealed near the film's end is much more dangerous.<br /><br />The film results in a nice twist that I for one didn't see coming. And its one of those twists where to give it away would ruin it for the first time viewer. Suffice to say that if you stick through till the end, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />So is the film the best sci fi movie out there? Not quite. For all of its gritty, metal clad look, the type of spaceship we've seen in numerous films since the release of ALIEN, the movie feels like its bouncing back and forth over too much terrain. Sure the stories keep your interests, but at the same time talk comes at the expense of action and action at the expense of talk. They often seem in the wrong place.<br /><br />Quaid and Foster turn in equally impressive performances. Both have their own reasons to go on living and to see that the mission is accomplished. But they're nowhere near the same reasons.<br /><br />Twenty years from now only die hard fans will recall this movie. It's not ALIEN or 2001. But it is a good evening's entertainment and that makes it worth giving it a watch. You might not want to add it to your collection, but you will want to add it to you \\"to rent\\" list.fans will recall this movie. It's not ALIEN or 2001.

B002VKE1K2|2.0|After getting a few responses from people about the 4 out of 5 I thought about it.  This movie was stupid.  I decided to give it a 2.  It was boring.  I mean, it did make me jump.  But oh well.  A 2 it is.<br /><br />Fear is described as an unpleasant usually strong emotion caused by anticipation or awareness of danger.  You surely do feel fear when watching this movie.  It's little things that scare you.  You won't see men standing in the shadows with a knife and blood all over him.  Nor will you see monsters or creatures of the sort.  The things that happen in this movie that make you afraid are the unknown.<br /><br />The movie has a very simple story.  A man and lady think something is going on in there house.  So, the man decides to set up stuff to record the sounds in there home as well as get a camera to video tape.  He even records them when they sleep.  You can see the time on the bottom of the screen.  At first they play the time by fast.  Skipping through hours in a few seconds.  Then, they stop and show it in real time.  Your heart starts racing and the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Why?  Well, you wonder why they have started to play the video in normal speed.  Even if you don't hear or see anything.  It actually adds more fear not seeing stuff.  Makes you wonder when or if you will eventually.  Sometimes the lady till get out of bed and stand looking at the man in bed.  Hours go by and she just stands, watching.  Again, the not knowing what she is going to do will make you almost scream.  It's amazing how so little can do so much.  More writers should watch this movie and think about it.<br /><br />The horror of the film is kind of ruined when watching it at home, while at the same time adding some fear.  You loose some because your at home.  You can turn down the TV or even fast forward through to see what will happen.  I turned down my TV.  If I had seen it in the theater I would have probably been shaking.  You add a little fear as well though.  Why?  Well, your watching it at home.  The movie is all inside the peoples house.  At home your either alone or with only a few people.  When the movie is through you will probably start looking around and jumping when you hear a creek, crack or sound.  No matter how loud or soft.<br /><br />I had given this a 4 at first.  But I mean, the story is really pointless.  Anyone could have written it.  Seeing a movie that has a monster grow out of a rock and walk through your wall, while possibly being scary, isn't real.  I mean, who is going to be afraid that something like that will happen?  This movie is simple and really does seem like a home movie.  The ending is the worst part.  It totally ruins the movie.  While the movie makes you think that it could happen to you or anyone, the end just goes all sci fi  and ends like a typical horror movie.  I will not say what happens.  There is nothing extra on this movie except for alternate endings.  I mean, how much money did this movie cost to make and how much did it actually make.  Seems they could have sold it for 10 dollars and loaded it with extra stuff.  I would wait for a while before buying.  They will probably release a version of the DVD with extra stuff.  So no one says what I know they will say, I didn't base my review on the lack of extras.  I based it on what the movie made me feel.  I actually didn't like the movie at all.our watching it at home.

B002VKE0XA|4.0|After reading the reviews on here I was not expecting to enjoy this movie.  However, it did make quite a splash theatrically so I figured it was worth a watch.  I did not buy it, but I rented it from a Redbox.  I am buying it now just to watch with people that haven't seen it yet.  It isn't really the kind of movie you watch more than once because the best part of this movie is the suspense and not knowing what is coming.  I frequently buy movies to show to other people, not to watch over and over again alone.<br /><br />If you like to be scared, and you aren't so cerebral that you can't forget you are watching a movie, then you will really like this one.  I love scary movies.  I also love horror movies.  But I wouldn't really call this a horror movie (e.g. Texas Chainsaw Massacre).  It is more of a scary ghost story (e.g. The Sixth Sense).  Now don't jump all over me for comparing it to The Sixth Sense.  (It's good, but not that good).  I found the acting to be quite good.  The actors did a great job of seeming spontaneous and realistic.  The camera work is not as nauseating as Cloverfield or Blair With, but if that type of film bothers you than this one might also.<br /><br />This movie achieves its goal.  To scare you.  If you like the type of movie that makes you jump out of your seat than you won't be disappointed.  I'm embarassed to say this, but the night I watched it I freaked myself out so bad that I had to look under my bed and in the closet before I went to bed.  I know I'm a wimp.<br /><br />I think this is the kind of movie that people either hate it or love it.  It's been a while since I've seen a movie that really scared me.  And this movie definitely did that.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys Stephen King books and those shows on A&E where they try to find real ghosts.  LOL.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|I've read the reviews here and all the while I'm playing these songs at home, work, in the car, etc. Can't seem to get enough of the beautiful love songs showcased on this CD. Alicia and her team have written heartfelt ballads (which I happen to luv)and beautiful melodies. My faves: That's How Strong My Love Is, Un-thinkable (I'm Ready), and How It Feels to Fly. Listen carefully--you'll be hooked too!
B002ECJZ76|3.0|There are many Christmas movies that my family and others watch over and over again. A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, The Polar Express, How The Grinch Stole Christmas ...all classics in my house. Sadly, I do not think Christmas Story story is going to join their ranks.<br /><br />It is by no means a bad movie -- it just wasn't great. I enjoyed it, though at times found the out-of-synch English dubbing to be a little distracting, as others have mentioned. No, the story was heartwarming and emotional; an interesting take on the mythos of Saint Nick from young child to bearded gift giver. The acting was engaging as was the lovely wintery cinematography. The soundtrack fit the movie but was ultimately forgettable. Though billed as a \\"family\\" film, it is suited more for adults. It really didn't hold my children's interest for the entire running time.<br /><br />While it has more substance than a lot of the modern Christmas movies, I feel it lacks that certain \\"something\\" that would elevate it to Christmas Classic status. It is certainly worth watching though, and I plan on giving it another try next year. May the kids will be ready for it then.

B001DZDTWW|5.0|This album is a great rocker.I guess many Rush purists say after 2112 or say ''Hemispheres'' they sucked-nonsense.They just evolved in their way & used more synth but creatively,Lost fans & gained new ones but back to 2112: it's definetely as heavy as metal got back in '76.They listened to UFO, Genesis,the whole 9 yards & came with this killer opus.I was 13 when I got the vinyl copy in '79,was crazy for peart's drumming.Went thru the first ''black spine'' cd & recently got this cause the cd reached the end of it's lifespan.No comparrison in sound quality.This album always has,always will be welded into my life's playlist.It's great!
0670021652|3.0|I LOVED Eat Pray Love.  As you've probably heard, this is totally different.  It's her musings, interviews and a history of marriage.  Her thoughts - such as how people in their 20's who get married tend to spend more time thinking about the wedding venue than how they'll live together for the rest of their lives - would be a great advice essay.   But as a book, it definitely doesn't grab you.
B002BX4VEK|5.0|For my buddy and rival, Mohair Sam.<br /><br />I come out of jazz and progressive rock, but really, I am a music man. I could not care two wiffs about genre labals and I know master music when I hear it.<br /><br />Image implications aside, I have always liked Elvis. No matter what the context, his abilities as a singer are unmatched and universally undeniable. Strip away the myth entirely, and you are left with one of the best voices--and uses of it ever.<br /><br />I heard the 1950s stuff as a kid and like it. In the 60s, Elvis was trying to be a moive star, and the soundtracks fed him subpar material--though his singing continued to be great.<br /><br />Memphis Sessions are to me the classic recordings of this classic singer. By 1969, recording had modernized. Elvis came to Memphis with his voice in full prime, infinately improved technology, and by far, his best backing band.<br /><br />Elvis had great musical instincts, and you can tell by hearing this. He stayed who he was even in 1969. He did not try to go psychadelic or compete with the Beatles, Hendrix, or Joplin.<br /><br />What he did do, perhaps his best asthetic move ever, was to choose a rubbery soul based on blues and gospel. Music that was completely him. Music that he synthasized in the 50s to create rock and roll: the ultimate fusion of African American song form. He probably did not even think about this; as with the Beatles with melody and Coltrane with harmonics, this was in  Elvis' DNA.<br /><br />\\"Rubberneckin',\\" \\"In The Ghetto,\\" \\"Suspicious Minds,\\" every track here has Elvis in absolute command of the art he knew so well. He has the voice of his youth, but the cofidence and timing of a master. Rarely do you hear a vocalist, a vocal ARTIST, with such natural ability in such prime form.'<br /><br />This may not be the only best Rock and Roll ever recorded, but it is certianly undefeatable rock. Never has been topped, and never will be
B001CISHU4|5.0|The career of Amon Amarth has nowhere to go except up. With a heady mixture of both brutal riffage and experimentation such as a violin solo, \\"Twilight of the Thunder God\\" is truly a gem amongst rocks in the vast death metal quarry. The title track itself screams with raw fury as it announces the arrival of these Viking metal legends onto the battlefield with vocalist Johan Hegg, as always, fiercely enumerating the Viking creed. Other songs such as Live for the Kill and Embrace of the Endless Ocean project a kind of dark beauty with their yearning melodies and self-pitying lyrics. Still others including \\"Guardians of Asgaard\\" and \\"Varyags of Miklagaard\\" are powerful incitements to unrestrained chest-beating and a good old fashioned growl-along. These two especially, bind Norse mythology to Viking history with results that appeal both to the fan base as well as the uninitiated or casual listeners. In an era where extreme metal is just beginning its naissance into mainstream culture, Amon Amarth stand at the forefront of this often ridiculed genre with a no-nonsense, meat and potatoes offering that would allay even the most hardened skeptics of their sincerity and passion. When merchandising gimmicks and profligate promotion are slowly becoming the life-bread of many new bands, we should consider ourselves fortunate to enjoy the art of bands such as Amon Amarth who offer us nothing more than professional musicianship without the jazz and flair.
B002ZG997M|2.0|(i.e., just like when one of those criminally ignorant athletes makes the ridiculous proclamation of having \\"god\\" on their side that day, that enabled him to score the winning goal unit for his team).<br /><br />Yup, I began my review as a footnote to the subject line.<br /><br />I had no knowledge of this movie beforehand, but I did have a couple of expectations based on what I saw of the commercials, and what a friend of mine told me.<br /><br />1) I expected an epic, post-apocalyptic tale that completely engages you, and draws you into its gritty, dark world.<br /><br />2) A friend of mine said he's never seen a crowd that quiet after the show. I took that to be a positive thing.<br /><br />Only one of the two items listed above turned out to be true.<br /><br />Let me cut straight to the chase- you take the religious aspect out of this movie and you're left with an average flick with bad pacing, ZERO character development, and poor directing.<br /><br />What does it matter if it's The Bible or not? It's about a dude carrying a book and headed West because that's what god wants him to do. That's the story right there. And then you've got Meg from Family Guy teaming up with him, who rivals Kate Bosworth in Superman Returns as far as epic miscastings go.<br /><br />**Usually in a movie where you're following one central character in a huge, lonely world, you really get engrossed with that character and really care about what happens next. Here they forgot about character development so nothing really mattered. We're just watching Denzel with glasses and a beard.<br /><br />**While the fighting scenes were flashy, I don't like their choice of how they shot it, or portrayed his character. It's definitely fun to see Denzel as a total badass on-screen, but I don't get how his fighting skills are up to the level of being able to dispatch enemies in seemingly mere nano-seconds with absolutely RAZOR SHARP precision and accuracy, with NO MISTAKES. With or without the spoiler, that still doesn't explain it. This portrayal took away from the realism and made him seem like some superhero, or invincible. Was there any explanation given as to why he's able to operate in this manner? Was it because god was protecting him? That's a cop out answer. Is god the answer to anything that can't be explained with rational logic? Oh wait..<br /><br />**Denzel and Meg from Family Guy had no chemistry in this movie. She plays the cookie cutter 'young, attractive girl fascinated by mysterious older man' role to a tee.<br /><br />**How is it that a no name wannabe movie critic can see a a movie and easily point out the number of unnecessary (and embarrassing) slow motion shots in a movie, yet professional movie makers can't, and in fact, readily DOUSES the movie in it.<br /><br />**My reviews aren't complete until I whine and moan about a character's decisions and illogical actions in a movie. Well we're at that point. The morning after Meg from Family Guy leaves Denzel's cell and goes to see her mother and Gary Oldman, she gets questioned by Gary Oldman about whether or not Denzel had a book. Just look at this scene, she could've EASILY just lied and said no. But instead, here she is cowering like a mindless retard, even as her mother gets threatened, she's standing there as if she's trying hard to hold in a secret, when in fact, all she had to do was adamantly state that THERE WAS NO BOOK and she has no idea what he's talking about. The kind of actions seen here would be the kind where some powerful mind reading overlord has someone captured, and that captured person knows that the overlord can easily see past his lies due to his supernatural abilities, so when questioned, he's very hesitant to lie because he knows the repercussions of lying, and so is more or less paralyzed with fear, not knowing whether lying or telling the truth would be the better choice. THAT SCENARIO DIDN'T APPLY HERE WITH MEG GRIFFIN AND GARY OLDMAN.<br /><br />Hughes Brothers,lol. These clowns should've stayed retired.

0060825456|4.0|I had the seen the movie before reading this so I knew what this was about. This graphic novel was totally different from the movie but with some similarities. I have never read the original adaption to this book so I can not compare the two.<br /><br />In this version it starts out with Coraline in her normal life where her parents are too busy with their jobs to entertain her. She is bored because she has nothing to do but interact with her wacky neighbors. One day Coraline decides to explore and then her life changes..<br /><br />I really loved the illustrations in the book. They were well done. I found myself entranced in this graphic novel that I hardly put it down in the 2 hour sitting. While I can not compare it to the original I really enjoyed this and I think kids will too.
B000QUCNP4|5.0|\\"Zodiac\\", by Robert Graysmith is one of the greatest nonfiction crime books ever written. Graysmith's agonizing reconstruction of the late 1960s and early 1970s Zodiac murders in California is astonishing in its own right, and this feature is worthy of his efforts. Though the case remains technically open in several California jurisdictions, the suspect thought most likely to have committed the murders, Arthur Leigh Allen, was never charged and died of a heart attack several years ago.<br /><br />The film is brilliant in its representation of the era, with all the details from types of cars to airliner paint schemes nearly perfect in every way. It is brilliantly directed by David Fincher as a dark and menacing drama. \\"Zodiac\\" is extraordinarily creepy and nuanced while never resorting to gore (though some of the murders are graphic), with great lighting and details: I liked the oppressive rain throughout much of the film, for instance.<br /><br />The acting is superb, with Jake Gyllenhaal playing the introverted Graysmith, an inspired performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as a drug and alcohol addicted reporter, Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards perfectly cast as homicide investigators, and the brilliant John Carroll Lynch (\\"Fargo\\") as Arthur Leigh Allen.<br /><br />The only critique I have of the film is that at 157 minutes, it is rather long, and could have probably been trimmed by fifteen minutes quite easily. Without question, \\"Zodiac\\" is a research-intensive and detail-oriented picture, which embodies the best of true crime drama.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie because i absolutely LOVED Michael. I think they were very successful in showing the true genius that was MJ. Just like other true geniuses, he is more appreciated in death than in life. This movie proves that the media stories about him and drugs, illness, etc were totally false. No one could have done the things he did under the influence of drugs. He was very much alive and in control. Showcasing his godlike talent, childlike personality and superhuman abilities and pure, uncontaminated capacity for PURE Love. Something the media whores will never understand. This DVD gives us all a part of Michael to love, cherish and pass on for generations because he is the best there is and the best there will EVER be!!!!!!!
0385339682|2.0|It's weird, but during this book I suffered through various feelings of like and dislike. When I started reading it, I actually liked it quite a lot, but then it sort of seemed to drag on.<br /><br />The inside flap of The Last Juror states that it's about how Danny Padgitt murdered a woman and while he was on the stand, threatened to harm the jury if they convicted him. But really only about the first 50 pages and the last 100 pages actually dealt with the trial and Padgitt's threat. My main gripe with this is that it deviated so much from what it seemed the actual book was about. When I started reading this, I thought that it would be suspenseful with this sort of agonizing tension starting from the trial to Danny Padgitt's threat to the picking of the jurors one by one, but it wasn't like that.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me was the actual ending. It seemed very anticlimatic and it seemed like it came out of left field. I found myself thinking \\"That's very, very implausible\\" and also \\"How would no one know?.\\" The ending was also very abrupt.<br /><br />I guess some of the book was interesting and I did care about some of the characters. It was also nice how he had characters from A Time To Kill appear briefly in The Last Juror. Although, I really didn't think Lucien Wilbanks was such a bastard in A Time to Kill, but I thoroughly disliked him in this one.<br /><br />I've only read one other Grisham book and that was A Time To Kill. That one was fabulous. This one...not so much. I'm still planning on picking up some of his other books (especially since I own like six others) and am hoping the brilliance that was behind A Time to Kill, shines brighter on one of the others.

0792839749|5.0|I have to imagine this screenplay and some songs were pitched to Disney for a live-action production (or perhaps one that mixed in animation, like 'Mary Poppins' and 'Bedknobs and Broomsticks'), but most likely Disney balked at the high price. The critical reaction to this film upon release in the US was to quite an extent negative. But I loved it as a child and I still love it. Here is why:    1. It integrates fantasy, some of it a bit scary, into real outdoor settings--instead of the matte paintings, animation, and Hollywood sets that Disney used.  2. That car. It's the most beautiful old car you will ever see in a film except perhaps the one in 'The Reivers' (from about the same time period in film making too).  3. Dick van Dyke. He gets a real lead role in a musical romance. He could sing, he could really really dance, and he could act.   4. Sally Ann Howes never got the fame of Julie Andrews, but she is a better singer and actor, with more screen presence and warmth.  5. This film is an adaptation of an Ian Fleming story. Fleming's book is a nice piece of whimsy for children, but this film's screenplay marries that whimsy to a much more elaborate plot, one Roald Dahl helped concoct (and he knew how to keep children's stories interesting for children and adults).    This, along with Willy Wonka, are two films that outdid Disney, even if the American critical reception was mixed. They just didn't get it. But audiences did, which is why this film and Willy Wonka are holiday classics.
B000J103PC|3.0|Anne Hathaway's character takes a job at a fashion magazine, working as an assistant for an overbearing and demanding boss from hell (played by Meryl Streep).  Everyone at the company is arrogant, self-centered, and fixated on low body weight.  this is in contrast to Anne Hathaway, who comes from a more simple, down to earth background.  She is frequently mocked for being a size 6.  The plot is an obvious jab at the fashion industry.  Streep's character is completely unreasonable as a boss, yet Hathaway bends over backwards to please her (at the expense of her private life).  In real life nobody would take the kind of abuse or demands that are imposed on her.  Streep completely uses and abuses Hathaway to fulfill her own selfish and arrogant persona.  Despite this fact, Hathaway's character actually becomes sympathetic to her boss and seemingly becomes a better person as a result.  This didn't make a lot of sense to me and made the whole movie rather pointless.  But seeing two of the best modern day actresses in a movie together made the film somewhat worthwhile, at least for one viewing.

I think Steve Woz was right in there with the true innovators.  I'd like to read about some other actual inventive people of the time, but his details are amazing, and basic enough to be accessible. If you're just an Apple fanboy or a computer everything lover, this will get you inside the feel of those times...which were pretty darned exciting if you ask me. Wozniak's delight at his and others breakthroughs make this a good and fun book to read.

B002T9H2MO|4.0|Duncan Jones makes an auspicious feature film debut with \\"Moon\\", which draws on the sci-fi flicks of Jones' youth in the 1970s and early 1980s for its tone and existential themes. Sometime in the near future, Earth relies on Helium-3 fusion for much of its energy supply. The He-3 is collected by Lunar Industries from a mining base on the dark side of the moon. The Sarang Mining Base has a human staff of one, who is responsible for maintenance of the harvesters. That man is Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell). He is assisted by a creepily polite robot named GERTY (voice of Kevin Spacey). Sam's 3-year contract will be up in 2 weeks, and he can't wait to get back to his family on Earth. But Sam starts seeing things. He has an accident while tending to one of the harvesters. It begins to look like things at Sarang may not be what they seem.<br /><br />GERTY is reminiscent of HAL of \\"2001\\" fame. \\"Moon\\" isn't coy about alluding to other films, but the allusions are more often used to create an expectation in the viewer that will later be challenged than to simply imitate. \\"Moon\\" goes in a different direction. It was made on an impressive $5 million dollars, shot in only 33 days, and spent a year in post-production. A tiny budget for sci-fi, but it looks like a lot more. There are 400 effects shots, but most of the moon scenes are done with miniatures. Miniature models always look better than CGI, especially since they can now be cleaned up digitally. Sam Rockwell deserves praise for being able to carry the film with no one to talk to but himself. \\"Moon\\" has some lose ends that don't add up, but that doesn't distract from the unique environment and suspense that make it so appealing.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2010): Bonus features include a short film, 4 featurettes, 2 commentaries, and a theatrical trailer (2 min). \\"Whistle\\" (26 min) is a short film by Duncan Jones about an assassin who carries out his plans long-distance from his home with his family in the Alps. \\"The Making of Moon\\" (16 min) interviews Duncan Jones about sets, genesis of the film and Sam Rockwell about playing two roles. In \\"Creating the Visual Effects\\" (11 min), effects supervisor Simon Stanley-Clamp tells us how the clones, GERTY, lunarscapes, and lighting were achieved. \\"Science Center Q&A\\"* (20 min) was a Q&A session at NASA in Houston, where Duncan Jones takes questions.

The commentary by director/storywriter Duncan Jones and producer Stuart Fenegan is the more informative and technical.

0140437681|5.0|Summary<br /><br />Treasure Island was Robert Louis Stevenson's first full-length, published novel, which began as a story for his stepson.  The main character and the narrator is a boy named Jim Hawkins who lives and works in his parents' Admiral Benbow Inn.  A drunken buccaneer has been living at the inn and causing quite a scene among the locals.  After he receives a black spot (an item representing pirate judgment) from an old, blind pirate named Pew, the buccaneer dies, leaving behind an unpaid room and a seaman's chest.  Jim and his mother open the chest and find a bag full of coins of all different nationalities and a document containing a map.  They escape the inn just before a band of pirates begin to break in and search for the map, which leads to an island containing Captain Flint's buried treasure.<br /><br />Jim takes the map to Doctor Livesey and Squire Trelawney, who then immediately embark on a voyage on the ship Hispaniola, hiring Captain Smollet and a crew recommended by Long John Silver.  Silver and most of the crew he brings with him were part of Flint's voyage to Skeleton Island, unbeknownst to Livesey and Trelawney.  At sea, Jim finds himself in a barrel of apples and accidentally overhears plans for mutiny from the pirates, which he soon relays to Livesey, Trelawney, and the Captain.  Soon to land at the island, Jim Hawkins and the rest of the trustworthy crew plan a way to make it off the island with the treasure and their lives.<br /><br />My Reaction<br />Until I read this book, I did not realize how much I already knew about it simply from references in popular culture. International Talk Like a Pirate Day could very well have been originated from a group of readers fond of this classic tale of pirates, treasure, and island adventure.  In fact, I found just about everything I think about when I imagine pirates in this book.  (The only thing Stevenson left out was a few hundred uses of the now ubiquitous pirate word \\"Arr!\\" but that may be anachronistic.)  This alone I think demonstrates the far-reaching influence of this book as it applies to the popular view of pirate caricatures.<br /><br />Normally when one thinks of reading \\"classic literature\\" one expects a laborious trek through hundreds of pages of archaic phrases and unfamiliar circumstances.  Treasure Island is a refreshing reminder of why there are \\"classics\\" and has encouraged me to seek out others to read.  Despite being over one hundred years old, it is easy to immerse oneself in Jim Hawkins' place throughout the action.<br /><br />It took me a few pages to get used to some of the nautical terminology and Stevenson's use of apostrophes and phonetic spelling to illustrate the way the pirates were talking.  However once I figured out what he was doing, the characters' voices in my head were clear.  The action and suspenseful moments kept me turning the pages.  I even jumped a bit in the part when Jim accidentally ended up with the pirates in the middle of the night.  Descriptions easily laid out the setting of Skeleton Island.  In fact, some of the more bloody scenes were surprisingly descript considering this was a tale aimed at young boys, but nowadays the target audience has seen more than that in a single video game.<br /><br />I was also impressed with the character development within the novel.  This was truly a coming-of-age type of tale for Jim Hawkins, learning nobility and honor practically as he fought to keep his and his party's lives and dignity.  Long John Silver was mostly the star throughout because of his interesting mannerisms (\\"and you can lay to that\\") and his manipulative character.  Just when I thought I figured out Silver's motivation, he pulled out another trick.  The rest of the characters were distinct and multi-dimensional, with only one or two archetypes (Pew being one of evil villain, though he doesn't last long in the book).<br /><br />Overall, as many other reviewers have said, Stevenson did not waste any words in writing Treasure Island.  Everything written had purpose and added to the story.  I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a fun exciting page-turner, as well as to anyone wanting to get started reading the classics.e and added to the story.

1416572287|4.0|\\"If dog treats appeared out of empty space in the middle of a kitchen, a human would freak out, but a dog would take it in stride [... dogs] always expect treats to appear at any moment, for no obvious reason. [...] If you can look at the world the way a dog does, as an endless source of surprise and wonder, then quantum mechanics will seem a lot more approachable.\\"    Chad Orzel enlists his German shepherd, Emmy, to provide that perspective in HOW TO TEACH PHYSICS TO YOUR DOG. Each chapter opens with Emmy voicing some problem (usually related to improving her chances of nabbing a squirrel or bunnie or treat) that gives Chad a jumping-off point into physics concepts like particle-wave duality, uncertainty, measurement, teleportation. It's a cute device but it's also effective -- alternating theory with man-dog conversations both lightens the content and applies it to the everyday.    I endured a year of classical physics in college but came to this book after having developed an adulthood interest in quantum physics. I came away much more aware of the concepts involved, but only slightly more in command of them. (Maybe that's the way with physics, little by little?) But to be clear: this is a physics book and Orzel writes for a pop-sci physics audience: \\"Most people wouldn't know a wavefunction if they tripped over one, but almost everyone has heard of the uncertainty principle...\\" If that's not you, or if you're not interested in photons, probability, and polarization, this is not the book for you. But if that *is* you, enjoy! -- Orzel's approach is positive and curious, and Emmy is just plain fun.
B000G7PNAE|5.0|This album to me is their best, they were close also with \\"Infinity\\" but on \\"Escape\\" it is one rock and ballad CD that came out in the early 80's that wasn't hair band stuff, but overall is pretty similar and much better if you listen close enough to it.<br /><br />Nowadays perhaps they are considered a \\"guilty pleasure\\" due to perhaps their commercial appeal to teenage girls, women, and perhaps guys who were not really into metal, but were somewhere in between. Journey were I guess according to my sister somewhat attractive guys who made accessible songs, catchy songs with hooks and melody,  who rocked enough to annoy your parents, but did those sappy ballads that made them swoon. After many years to me they appeal to a broader range than I remember, and if you think all those hair bands in the mid to late 80's sounded the same and were embarassingly cheesy, give Journey a chance to give an early glimpse of how it should have been done, and in '81 it sets the template in places for the rock and ballad Cd. A Band like UFO had this down, Scorpions also back before this even and all had their own sound. Journey added in a nice dose of melody that would also become the norm in hard rock. Perhaps they were a tad bit softer than your average 80's hard rocker, but listening to this now it's a fun CD to jam to, they don't have a single filler track here, and my fav songs are mostly non singles it seems, and lesser known songs.<br /><br />Fav song of all time by the band is here in \\"Stone In Love\\" which is a classic journey song, hard rock, guitar solo, plenty of melody. Aanother fav in the title track \\"Escape\\", and it rocks plenty also with \\"Lay It Down\\", \\"Dead Or Alive\\", and \\"Keep On Runnin'\\", and I also love one of the 3 ballads in \\"Still They Ride\\". It has plenty of radio singles also with \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\", \\"Open Arms\\" (another ballad), and \\"Who's Crying Now\\" (ballad). Those 3 get the most attention, and if you like those perhaps you should check out the above mentioned songs also for Journey at their very best. Steve Perry could sing too, so it's not like todays commercial hard rock where they all sound like they were drummers forced to front the band, my apoligies to Dave Grohl...but isn't it true?<br /><br />Plus the added Live in Houston tracks are a nice addition to the latest reissue. This is a must CD for not just a Journey fan, but a hard rock fan to me, a guilty pleasur, but a very good one in that and much better than anything put out by those late 80's hard rock clones. The Beatles had melody, the Beach Boys did too, but when you get to this point where it really begins to turn into a harder sound, to me the natural progression is with a band like Journey, even Boston perhaps with their brief run. I personally like Ratt, Dokken, Van Halen, Motley Crue, and Hanoi Rocks to name a few along with Journey, and eventually progressed into Jane's Addiction, Saigon Kick, Extreme, Kings X, it all comes back to this CD in my opinion, it's influential even if nobody out there wants to readily admit it.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|Snapping the break beat in half, Liam Howetts's latest Prodigy album tops the dance charts for sheer relentlessness. Track after track with it's pulsating rhythm, bass and drums from opening to closing track. Whether he is pissed off at the reaction to the anticipated follow-up to 'Fat of the Land' (which featured the most noticeable chart-topping tracks) of the album 'Always Outnumbered, Never Outgunned' - which was received fairly poorly, or if he is just pissed off in general, one thing is for sure - this album is an all-or-nothing affair. Kind of like bounding over the borders of No Mans Land in a World War without looking back, it is a rollercoaster ride that will snap your neck with whiplash.   A lot of people have said that this is old-school Prodigy, or Prodigy repeating themselves, or so on, but this is an album slim of the fat (of the land), where everything is heading with missile precision straight to it's target. Easy listening it aint. Easy dancing, probably not either, but if ever dance music deserved a mosh pit then this would be the DJ's choice. Anyone looking to have some great techno that makes your heart skip, better buy this...
0545123267|5.0|I can count on one hand the number of books that I have physically clasped to my chest upon finishing. As if by that action I could keep that feeling in my heart forever.  Shiver is now one of those books.<br /><br />In a way, Shiver made me think of the movie Ladyhawk (1985), in which lovers (Michelle Pfeiffer and Rutegar Haurer) were cursed to live as animals, she as a hawk during the day, and he as a wolf during the night. Only during those brief moments of dusk and twilight could they see each other as humans. The idea is still deeply romantic (something the movie didn't quite pull off), and Maggie has captured that deliciously tense longing perfectly.<br /><br />It is immediately obvious that Maggie writes beautifully.  Hauntingly, painfully, beautifully. And her characters are as bright and crisp as the winter they dread. Chapter by chapter, the book switches first person perspectives from Grace and Sam, the majority of which are Sam's.  As characters, they are a study in complimentary contrasts.<br /><br />Sam is an old soul. He's thoughtful and poetic in how he interprets the world around him. He is consumed with words; their sound, their lyrical quality.  He often composes song lyrics in his mind throughout the book. He is all to aware of their absence for him when he is a wolf. And he possesses that one quality that unites all great men: the capacity to love so completely that it encompasses every fiber of their being. For Sam, Grace is his world.<br /><br />Grace is practical to a fault, at least in the eyes of her rather free spirited parents. She is passionate and brave. She holds her emotions close, but feels deeply. She is resilient in a way that those around her can scarcely fathom. She longs for that one person to connect with mind, body, and soul, but the more rational part of her doesn't really expect him to come.<br /><br />In addition the the writing and characters, what I especially loved about this book was the sense of desperation that the author created. The inevitability of Sam returning to his wolf form, possibly forever, juxtaposed with the certain knowledge that Grace and Sam belonged together, that separating them would just as certainly destroy them both.<br /><br />Every paranormal story about first love will automatically be compared to Twilight, and Shiver is already no exception. The stories and characters in the two books are radically different, but the emotions evoked by both are wonderfully similar. This story of girl who falls in love with a wolf who can only resume his human shape during the summer, will touch your heart, and the writing will delight your senses.

0439023483|5.0|What a book! This is the first book that I can genuinely say made me bump up my traditional 4 star rating for a \\"good\\" to \\"pretty good\\" book to a tremendous 5 star rating for this one. The Hunger Games setting is a bleak one. America, as we know it, has been crippled/weakened by war, fire, famine, and drought. In place of all of that? A new country named Panem that's divided into 12 districts. There were once 13 districts, but the 13th district was defeated when it attempted an uprising against The Capitol of Panem. As punishment for the uprising, President Snow has an annual \\"Hunger Games\\" and Panem/United States has basically become a fascist/dictatorship of sorts. In the Hunger Games, 2 young representatives (also called \\"tributes\\") are chosen from each of the 12 districts each year in what amounts to a very warped/messed up contest where 24 tributes fight to the death, in what is required viewing for the citizens of all districts and dressed up in the form of televised entertainment in which just one will survive.<br /><br />The story centers primarily around two young tributes in Katniss and Peeta, the chosen tributes for District 12. At first, Katniss' younger sister Prim is selected but Katniss volunteers in her place as the female tribute. The male chosen is Peeta, a son of a local baker and an unlikely competitor in a competition where other districts have trained their tributes their whole lives for. Katniss and Peeta are the underdog heroes from District 12 that everyone loves to root for. They're up against bigger and stronger competition that have been training their tributes their whole lives for these games in addition to the fact that they are playing for prides sake in a district that has been among the bottom feeders of the overall 12 Districts of Panem. Both characters are tremendous and you end up caring about both of them as the story goes on. That being said, the Hunger Games definitely was not a soft read. This was one of the first books that genuinely got me emotionally charged up in quite a while. When the reader is invested in the book beyond just reading the pages but emotionally as well, it rings in at a different level from me than just \\"good\\" books. The state of dystopia that the United States (and now Panem) is in gets to you, but the barbaric/blood-thirsty concept of The Hunger Games is just mind-numbing/blood boiling. The fact that such a corrupt system of power is in place and that these kids have to brutally slaughter each other at a young age just to survive for the sport of entertainment is crazy.<br /><br />The ending was a little weak though. As part of a trilogy, that's somewhat excusable but Collins still could have given us a little more to work with for a resolution of Book 1. I know, I know...it's a trilogy but still, I felt like it wasn't as complete as it could have been. Perhaps that's the sign of a great book and maybe a little nitpicking. That's my 2 cents on it. If you decide to pick it up, you're in for a real page-turner and what hopefully is an excellent trilogy :).<br /><br />-Travis S.y got me emotionally charged up in quite a while.

B00006FMAW|5.0|There's a reason why horror flicks such as this one are highly sought after.  I'm still not shocked at all for what sellers are asking for.  I too, like a crack fiend, gave in and payed a ridiculous price to have Society in my personal Horror collection.  It's because this film delivers the goods such as: originality, gross factor (as in bodies melting into each other), that's unique for its time, humor, weirdness, creepiness, and surprisingly stamps a shocking scene that wont leave my mind!  Society tells a truly twisted alien-like family that have to survive by committing the nastiest of actions!  I wont give spoilers; I'm sure someone here as already typed up the whole story. haha.  You'll just have to take my word and check it out!<br /><br />I can't stress this enough when talking about Screaming Mad George's special effects!!!  His work always amazing to me!  If your into horror flicks such as: Slither, Silent Night Deadly Night -4, Amityville 1992: It's About Time, Slither, Night of the Creeps, and the Basket Case series.
0345451325|4.0|\\"The Fall of Reach\\" is a prequel to the events in the popular Halo video game. We recently got an Xbox and one of our first games was Halo (which is very good), but we were interested in the \\"backstory\\" so did a little searching and found this book. I enjoy military Sci-Fi and found this a surprising good read, able to stand on its own without the game tie-in.<br /><br />No plot spoilers from me, the story follows the creation of the elite Spartans, from project inception to major battles, and gives good background information on the human and Covenant organization. The main focus is on John (the character you play in the game) but also covers other key characters that show up in the game. This is helpful as it fleshes out the game and makes the interaction a little more enjoyable.<br /><br />The writing is solid for the genre, not quite on par with [[ASIN:0312536631 The Forever War]] or [[ASIN:B002NPCSJG Old Man's War]] (both of which I enjoyed) but much better than a lot of other mass market books. The development of the major characters was good enough but the ancillary characters are mostly underdeveloped. The action sequences are well handled and descriptive, without being too gory. Also, there are no real \\"adult oriented\\" scenes in the book.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book and finished it in three sittings, not great literature but certainly enjoyable - especially for those that play the Halo games. Also look at the next book in the series, [[ASIN:0345459210 The Flood (Halo #2)]] which parallels the game.<br /><br />CFH<br /><br />Recommended!
0439813786|5.0|There are really no words to describe how much I loved this book. The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a perfect blend of a short story, illustrations and film pictures.<br /><br />Hugo Cabret is a 12 year old boy who takes care of clocks. He comes from a family skilled in the upkeep of clocks. And he has a story to tell.<br /><br />What makes this book so brilliant is the old adage a picture is worth a thousand words. Instead of describing with written word the movement of the characters and the setting of each scene we get to see it all and follow Hugo through his story. The illustrations are beautiful. As much as I wanted to find out more of the story I found myself wanting to just linger over each picture - and now that I know the story I plan on going back to just do that.<br /><br />Beware though! With all those illustrations comes a price. This is a very thick novel. It's hard on the hands - I ended up having to read it with it lying on a table in front of me. Don't be scared by the size though, for all its bulk it really is a short story, but a very satisfying one
0312370849|2.0|this book was so 1 dimensional and it was so repetitive. Avoid it. I didn't like the way it was written either, perhaps because it was translated?
0385737947|5.0|The Maze Runner is a science fiction novel that is full of suspense, riveting characters and an incredibly fascinating, horrifyingly built world.<br /><br />This is a story about Thomas - a boy who finds himself amongst other teenage children in The Glade - an area surrounded by massive walls - and outside of the walls?  An ever-changing maze.<br /><br />What I loved about this book was first and foremost, the pace.  One minute I was on page 44 and thoroughly enjoying the ride (albeit somewhat confused still) and the next it was three hours later and I was approaching page 300.  Time flew by and I was devouring the words in front of me.<br /><br />Thomas and Teresa are only two among a set of great leading characters.  Chuck made me laugh, Newt inspired confidence and a sense of security in me, Alby made me feel frustrated, but safe.  Each of these characters had such a distinct personality that I felt as if I had known them already.<br /><br />I also loved how Dashner methodically peeled away the layers of the mystery at the heart of the book, feeding me clue by clue and engaging me right up until the very end.. and the end.. wow.  All I can say is read it.<br /><br />The only complaint I have about this book is a common complaint I have with other science fiction novels.  It's a personal preference thing, but sometimes I feel as if the world building starts so early that it's building all around me before I've had a chance to get a firm grasp on it.  For that reason it took me a few false starts to really get going into the book - so if you react in the same way to science-fiction with all the name-dropping and strange phrases, don't give up! You'll get into it, I promise.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who read The Hunger Games and enjoyed it.  Although the story is different, the overall feel of the book is very similar in that it's intense, difficult to put down and really fascinating.
B001U6YI92|2.0|As much as it pains me to give 2 stars to one of my favorite movies, please note that I am only reviewing the the Blu-Ray release put out by MGM in the U.S.    MGM has used so much Digital Noise Reduction, that the result is upscaled DVD quality, NOT Blu-Ray quality.  And the picture is slightly cropped, to boot.  By contrast, the Italian Blu-Ray put out by Mondo looks wonderful (but lacks the original English audio, so I wouldn't rush out to buy that either).      You can see comparison pictures here: [...]  As if to add insult to injury, only the remixed audio track is present here.  The audio track with the original sound effects is nowhere to be found but on the Italian mono track.  Seeing as the English mono track is just as much the \\"original\\" audio as the Italian (if not more, since all three main characters originally recorded their lines in English), what gives?    Please hold MGM to a higher standard, and wait until we get a proper release.  If need be, buy the 2-disc DVD to tide yourself in the meanwhile, since it includes essentially the same content as the current Blu-Ray release anyway.      Suggestion to movie studios that overuse DNR: if you're so concerned that mainstream consumers will be turned off by film grain, why not include an insert in every Blu-Ray package that shows how the image quality is negatively affected when film grain is attempted to be removed?
B002VKE1K2|3.0|When I first heard about this movie hitting the theaters, I admit I was kind of nervous to go after hearing how horrifying it is. And maybe if I had gone it would have been. But after hearing about it for months and hearing about the general plot, I finally convinced my bf to watch it with me (he thought it'd be lame so he didn't want to).   The idea of being stalked and posessed by a demon is creepy b/c there are actual cases out there that claim this (the exorcism of emily rose). Maybe if I knew nothing of this movie, saw it in a dark theater by myself, I would have been really freaked out. But watching it in my house just didn't do much for me.   People keep making fun Katie, but honestly if something like this was lurking around wouldn't you be a little PO'd? I'd probably be in a corner crying and speed dialing a demonologist in no time. Why she never spoke up as a kid or ever about this and just was cool with living with it is beyond fake. I understand how she'd be mad at Micah for provoking it, but why she didn't just stay with her friend, find a priest, or put the camera away and stop bugging it the minute she saw evidence of it is again, beyond me.   Micah acted like a typical cocky guy who wanted to 1) see all the cool evidence this thing exists and 2) I guess be the hero as he kind of said, and try to get rid of the thing that's stalking his gf.   Why he thought catching stuff on camera would be sure to get rid of it, or catching it's footprints would be enough evidence to what? scare it away, annoy it and make it leave? I have no idea.   I probably wouldn't watch this again but it was good at least once. It's kind of like Blair Witch except you actually see stuff. I can't even remember anything about BW it was so incredibly boring, but this movie is more interesting and I suppose could possibly happen, at least to an extent. The psychic isn't the greatest actor and is kind of dramatic and uninformative about what they should do since it's not his area ofexpertise. But other than that, I thought the 2 actors seemed real enough where if you didn't know this was a movie, may actually trick you into thinking it was a documentary. Overall I'd say give it a shot. For those who gave it 1 star were probably just disappointed after everyone hyped it up. for those who gave it 5 probably are freaked out by the idea that in some small way it could have been real. Or at least the idea of it. Watch it once. Don't watch it in the dark if you freak out easily, and if you're sceptical, then watch it alone in the dark and maybe you'll get something out of it.

B00142X56Y|3.0|This is certainly worth having.  Diana Damrau's Queen of the Night is the most magnificent, vocally and dramatically that I have seen.  The blu-ray picture and sound are exquisite.  Will Hartmann as Tamino and Dorothea Roschmann as Pamina are youthful, vibrant, have lovely voices and great chemistry together.  Simon Keenlyside, however, is one of the weakest Papagenos I've seen.  The role of Papageno, although a secondary lead, is the more important role in terms of sustaining interest throughout the opera, particularly in the second act.  His is the comic, everyman role, and as such it requires superb timing and virtuousity to pull it off.  He just doesn't have it and the opera suffers because of it.  Ailish Tynan as Papagena misses on all fronts.  She is supposed to be presented, initially, as an old hag.  In this version she is presented from the beginning as a sleazy tart, so there is no point to Papageno's eventual discovery and delight.  In summary, much to enjoy, worth having, but ultimately, a disappointment.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|That a movie has to be made to inform the American public where food comes from is a remarkable testament to how much life has changed in the past century.<br /><br />Michael Pollun makes this point about his book, The Omnivore's Dilemma, but it applies equally well to this 2008 film from Emmy award-winning producer/writer/director Robert Kenner.  Food, Inc presents little revelatory to those interested in issues of health, environment, food safety, or animal welfare.  What it does well is pull together many of these strands to weave an informative, non-polemical, and visually captivating introduction for the many millions not yet aware of the hidden costs of the modern food industry.<br /><br />Early on in the film an agricultural engineer asks, what's wrong with maximizing yield?  The answer is found in the many stories that follow but is summarized best by a free range rancher who observes that if the meat packing industry treats animals as little more than commodity, if it treats them as nothing more than a package of protein to be manipulated for profit, then it is most unlikely these same companies, these same people, have more benign or even enlightened attitudes towards employees or customers.<br /><br />The CEO of Stonyfield offers a way forward that balances yield with stewardship, commerce with compassion.  A lot of his like-minded friends are aghast at his \\"collusion\\" with the corporate enemy, but he reminds them that because Wal-Mart customers buy his yogurt, that much less pollution is prevented from entering the environment.  Wal-Mart officials confirm they began selling organic yogurt because of consumer demand.<br /><br />One aspect of the fuller story depicted only indirectly is the effect US companies and government have on food economics, policies, and consumption in countries beyond its borders.  It's not just the American consumer that is getting screwed.  Waistlines and diabetes are increasing in countries to which US-style fast-food, commercial food products, and food business models are exported.  It also fails to mention the simplest solution for reducing greenhouse gases, deforestation, food borne illness, suffering of sentient beings, and hunger - eating more plants and eating less meat.<br /><br />If you are interested in additional film resources, a few worth checking out include:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0053ZHZI2 Forks Over Knives]]<br />[[ASIN:B0014BQR74 How to Cook Your Life]]<br />[[ASIN:B000V5IOWK The Future of Food]]<br />[[ASIN:B0028N3TW8 The World According to Monsanto]]<br />[[ASIN:B000MEYKAU Fast Food Nation]]<br />[[ASIN:B001EP8EOY King Corn]]<br />[[ASIN:B000QX0LE6 EARTHLINGS]]<br /><br />#models are exported.

B000002JQ6|4.0|I have to echo the sentiments of another reviewer.  This is a good disc for those who are NOT huge fans of the band.  14 of the bet ACDC Songs are on this puppy including my three favorites(Whole Lotta Rosie, You Shook Me All Night Long and Highway To Hell) all in a row.  Almost all the songs are heavy and hard and Brian Johnson's vocals are oh so screetchy. So under normal circumstances, this recording would probably get three stars.  However, to distinguish it as on of the better releases by ACDC, I'm nudging it up a notch.

B001TH8UUA|1.0|I know that retail HDMI cables are priced extremely high and thought this cable was a real bargain by comparison. But, when substituted for another cable, this one gave dropouts in video and audio with the screen going to a speckled black and white pattern.  Maybe I got the only bad one....maybe not.    I have purchased many items from Amazon over the years and have always been satisfied with price, quality and service.  This is the first item that has not measured up.
B000AOEMXM|5.0|I love star trek...let's get that part out of the way on the front end. If you do not enjoy star trek, why are you looking at this item? I kid I kid.<br /><br />  This is probably my favorite ST series of all time, a series that was cut down in its prime. This fact leads to a bit of a hurried ending for the series and I feel that the final episode could have gone a much better way...however do not let this influence your decision on this series. It is phenomenol...it has all of the classical ST elements of social commentary and the exploration of not only space but humanity as well.<br /><br />  The series also has this wonderful feel of being a pioneer. The other ST series already have the federation behind them and a huge fleet of ships...but in this show there is only Earth with one deep space exploration ship and they are pretty much on their own (except the Vulcans...bleh).  This seems to lend something to the series that I felt was lacking in the other shows.<br /><br />  One more point in helping you decided to buy these DVD's.....lemme speak to just the guys.....Fellas the Vulcan science officer in this show is ridiculously hot......ludicrously hot even.  Trust me....I'm a professional.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Ok I am going to say I didnt LOVE Kelly Clarkson when she was on Idol, and when Thankful came out I thought it was bad, and then Breakaway I thought she sold out, but loved the CD and the songs just thought she would be another artist that would just make bubble gum pop songs for radio and success.     So when i heard Never Again i totally loved it, but still thought that her new cd was going to be the same pop junk as Breakaway. So once never again left the radio i offed kelly and had not heard from her in a while and figured her album was an epic fail and went on with life not wasting my time to even listen to the album, until I got out of a really bad relationship and didnt know what to do and was so hurt and could barely live each day, and my friend gave me the cd and said listen from the beginning and all the way to the end and OMFG!!!!!!!!! That is when i feel majorly hardcore in love with kelly clarkson!!!   The CD is so raw, so full of emotion so much pain and meaning in every song, and then i find out she wrote or co wrote every song on there i was stunned!! I mean Sober, and Maybe have got to be the best songs i have EVER heard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!     So no this is not the same kelly that is all sweet and kind and the same little girl on thankful and breakaway, she is SO much more this CD proves that! And i feel bad for the people that do not understand that she was hurt by her ex and she needed to cope with it by singing and writing and she wanted other people to know what she was going threw and have other people know that they are not alone so it is horrible that people think that this was a terrible album and she lost it when the fact is she just proved that she is way above anyone in the music industry in todays music so yes if ur looking for her pop side then go with Thankful, Breakaway, All I Ever Wanted, but My December i think will always be Kellys Golden Album!!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I am 38. I am cynical to this degree. When I went to the movie I was expecting a teen flick. What I've got was a best experience that lingered for weeks with me.

0345442970|4.0|Star Wars: Cloak of Deception, by James Luceno<br /><br />\\"Cloak of Deception\\" starts slowly as Luceno sets up a political thriller in the Star Wars universe. As the political plots are established, the book picks up steam, and I couldn't wait to finish it. Setting the background for \\"Episode I: The Phantom Menace,\\" this book explains the trade routes and taxation that will eventually lead to the Naboo blockade. If you were confused by the movie's political events, this is a good book to read before re-watching to get a better idea of what is happening.<br /><br />Senator Palpatine plays a large role, and his dual nature as a Sith Lord and Republic Senator is aptly described. Embodying the secrecy and stealth of the Sith, he manipulates the Senate, the Trade Federation, and resistance groups into creating a maelstrom of political messes that only he controls. Chancellor Valorum's fall from power is orchestrated in this book as well. If you wondered why the \\"no confidence\\" vote was initiated in the movie, \\"Cloak of Deception\\" explains why.<br /><br />Luceno's writing is sometimes a little too fancy for the Star Wars universe, but he does a good job otherwise. The political intrigue is the shining star of this book; while there are space battles and lightsaber fights, it's the politics, and rightly so, that are the best parts. He also introduces some upcoming ideas, such as differing views of the Force - Qui-Gon Jinn believes in the Living Force, Yoda and Mace Windu advocate the Unifying Force.<br /><br />I know after reading this I will view \\"Episode I: The Phantom Menace\\" with new eyes.<br /><br />4/5.

B0000029LG|5.0|I read the critical review by Steven Mirkin regarding MJ's History release and couldn't DISAGREE with him more.  I'm a huge fan of MJ's earlier work but was completely blown away by the depth of History.  It rightly depicts how MJ has matured as a brilliant artist.  The array of his music is stunning.  Take time to listen to the layers upon layers of musical sounds he incorporates into each song.  He shrewdly employs gospel, rap, historical spoken recordings, street sounds, plain speech, electric sounds into absolutely amazing masterpieces - every single one of the \\"new\\" songs on this release fits into this category.  No other artist can move another person the way that MJ can.  He was a gift beyond measure to this planet.  What a loss that can never be replaced.
B000M341QE|5.0|Why I enjoyed this movie and continue to do so.     Jack Nicholson    'nuff said
B002MEW7YY|5.0|I saw this originally during the Live in HD presentation and loved it. Other people (more experienced than I, probably) may not like it all that much, but I think it was fantastic (much more enjoyable than the Joan Sutherland version I first saw). I loved the update to the Victorian period and the sextet in Act II just gave me chills (not a common experience for me).     Mariusz Kwiecien is now one of my favorite baritones, due to this role (and hopefully will maintain that in the Live in HD's Carmen). His voice, his acting, his looks... I think they fit the role really well, and I can really see him as brother to Netrebko's Lucia.     Anna Netrebko? I think she was wonderful, despite all the criticism she receives. Perhaps not the best ever, but I think she has the talent (and the looks, of course) to really draw new people into opera and get them hooked.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Ah the cigarettes, the sexism, the smarmy executives, the docile secretaries, the bored housewives ... welcome to America in 1960 and specifically Madison Ave where this engrossing series is set.<br /><br />We are in the macho world of advertising execs on a quest to sell the perfect product while drinking and screwing their way to perdition. Much of the fun is seeing how much things have changed. Did people really smoke that much? I felt as if I was getting lung cancer just from watching them. They light up first thing in the morning, before meals, after meals, during sex, on the train, in the car, in the kitchen, in the toilet, in the office. The whole world musty have smelled of smoke. That lovely, blond, Grace Kelly look alike with the peaches and cream comlexion must have given off the odor of an ashtray.<br /><br />Were people really so sexist? Women, or rather girls, are treated totally like objects -- of desire, or more accurately of lust, of ridicule, of disdain, of pity, of scorn -- never ever as equals.<br /><br />The main character, Donald Draper, is a handsome, suave  and talented adman with a wife, two kids, a couple of mistresses and a secret. His secretary, Peggy Olson in an ingenue on the way up. Various other sleazy types inhabit the office. We also see Draper's home life, his lovely but bored wife Betty and the kids.<br /><br />There's a lot of pleasure to be had from spotting the period references. The reconstruction of the early sixties milieu seems to be flawless. Wonderful artifacts of the period, half-forgotten, seem to pop up at every moment. But of course, we're not really in 1960 -- we're looking back at ourselves not so long ago and wondering at how far we've come -- and how far we still have to go.<br /><br />This is a great series.

B000PFH4P4|5.0|Masterful. Indescribable.  The most amazing rock album ever. More than rock music, this is MUSIC. This is an album musicians appreciate. And writers will appreciate the incredible lyrical tale. Poetic, powerful, pervasive - this music, these words are in my soul. I am buying another CD because my vinyl is too precious to me to be lent out (most people can't play vinyl anyway), and I love sharing this with people who don't know it, especially younger people who have never heard anything like this before. And I doubt anything like this will ever come again, much like Beethoven's music.  Do yourself a favor.  Get rid of all distractions. Sit down.  Close your eyes. LISTEN all the way through. This is an experience not to be missed.
B000NVIXFK|5.0|First, \\"Hope\\" is not a jam, as a previous reviewer stated.    Yes, the lyrics are cynical and downbeat, but this is a true and realistic comment on the horrifying world we live in today.  Though he may not directly name concepts like terrorism, poverty, cutthroat materialism, religious violence, rampant cheating in sports, the economic depression we are all living through, etc., these are things that make today's world very scary.  It really is NOT \\"the world we thought we would inherit.\\"      People that just prefer \\"entertainment\\" are shallow.  This album is entertaining AND thought provoking.  No one seemingly wants to face the world as is really is.  I applaud Neil for having the guts to tell the truth.  If no one did that, things might not ever improve.  Additionally, looking at the past several albums Rush has released, THIS album is one that I have been playing over and over.  I guess I am just attracted to the truth, no matter how unpleasant it may be.  I'm glad I am not the only one who believes this.  Thanks again, Neil, for voicing the truth.
B001NB1E4G|5.0|This is probably about the 5th album I bought when I was a kid (40 years ago...wow). The original album had a lot of memorbilia, photos, a poster, etc. I eventually chucked or lost it all. Youth is wasted on the young, ya know.    This version of the record is actually better than the original, including such great songs as \\"Quick One\\" and \\"Sparks\\"    Anyway, this record:    a) made me into a major, lifetime Who fan  b) after so many years, can still be heard like it's the first time, always finding something new in the record.  c) has to be one of the best live album recorded by any artist.  d) truly captures what The Who was all about. Anybody who's a true fan should tell you that it's one of their best. (If they tell you that their best was \\"It's Hard\\", run the other way).    At the time I write this review, 8 people gave this one star. 8/400 people. Wonder what kind of music they were looking for; obviously not powerful, moving rhythm and blues!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Liked watching it better on TV, but it's still good when I watch it a second time.
0061537969|2.0|Okay, I understand that there are many more dog owners than race drivers out there and I also understand that race drivers as a group (I am among them) are generally not the most interesting people and a book about our thoughts and actions would only interest other race drivers. So whenever you see a book/film about racing (or, for that matter - about cowboys, cops, taxidermists, lawyers, tailors etc etc) just know from the opening page (or reel) that it isn't an accurate depiction of the endeavor. The authors add ingredients that they (or their financiers) feel that are missing.     That said, I like dogs and Enzo seems like a fine companion and seems to like TV as much as I do. But as storytelling goes, strip away the dog and the racing stuff and you have a boy meets girl, guy loses girl (not going to spoil it too much for ya), guy has problems and in the end, they all live happily ever after.  It has everything a reader might want except perhaps \\"...it was a dark and stormy night\\"
B0030MM68O|2.0|First off, I'm not an ex-military, so my criticisms are based on that.  I'd heard reviews from some friends that this movie was good, not great, but worth watching.

Well, I liked the beginning and had high hopes.  Then walks in the \\"hot shot\\" with absoluetly no regard for safety, his or squadmates.  It was just like all the typical Hollywood formula, ie: Charlie Sheen in Navy Seals, Tom Cruise in Top Gun, etc. etc., but at least in this movie the \\"hot shot\\" didn't get his squadmates killed. (only injured) And what about that moron Dr.?  Who didn't foresee him getting blown away the minute he sat in the Humvee?  Why didn't one \\"bomber\\" get killed?  Is it mandatory for soldiers to let the bombers (guys holding the detonation devices) just go along there merry little way?  What a piece of garbage!  The one break from the formula was not using the \\"cocky, ignorant, flashy, gangsta thug\\" black soldier, I think his role was well done.  So much potential, pretty good acting, only to be anchored down by following the typical Hollywood formula.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|I recently purchased a large monitor which fit my desk nicely, but I wanted to use my old Acer 22\\" wide screen as a second monitor for which there was no ideal location on the desktop.  After looking at almost all the desk and wall mounts on Amazon, I settled on the Ergotron 45-174-300, based on the reviews I had seen.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed.  It is one sturdy piece of hardware.  After receiving it, I realized the best place to mount it was several inches further in from the end of the desk than the clamp mount would accomodate.  No problem.  It comes with an alternate mount that needs only one hole for a bolt through the desktop.  That was perfect for my needs.  One thing I feel I should mention.  The mount I used is great if you have a thick, sturdy desktop.  If you don't, consider placing a 1 ft. square piece of 3/4\\" plywood below the desktop to distribute and stress mounting your monitor places on the desktop.<br /><br />Adjustments are simple and you can change the resistance to movement of each joint with the supplied allen screws.  The allen wrenches for these screws are supplied in the package.  The instructions are easy to follow.<br /><br />I usually don't say this about hardware, but it looks quite nice. :-)

B00192KCQ0|4.0|What can I say - there are already 996 reviews out there as I write this so i'm not holding my breath for any comments. This album is a refreshing \\"change\\" for Metallica after the more poppy direction of Load / Reload and the near disaster of St. Anger. This album has the feel of \\"And Justice for All\\" without being stuck in the 80's.<br />It sounds great although there is some clipping on some tracks - not sure if this is intentional? I really like this album its one of the more mature and well thought out Metallica records that isn't overly poppy or uber hard core metal. I reccomend it.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is brilliantly scripted, has two of the best acting jobs all year, and is purely Tarantino. If you've seen any of the [[ASIN:B001BR5F4C Kill Bill]] series or [[ASIN:B000R7HY0K The Grindhouse]] films, you'll know to expect a bit of blood and brutality. This is, however, Tarantino's first dip into alternate history, and he does a great job at it. However I do think he toned down the bloodshed a tad. Perhaps he's becoming more aware of it, or perhaps he just didn't feel the film warranted it. Whatever the reason, it balanced out nicely ...compared to his other films which tended to go overboard on the crimson.<br /><br />The alternate history involves three unique perspectives: Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) aka The Jew Hunter. Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt, [[ASIN:B001JIE7JM Burn After Reading]]). And Shosanna (Melanie Laurent). All three of these perspectives are taken to extremes (no surprise, again, considering we're talking about a Tarantino movie) during WW II in which we see a persecuted Jew get her just dessert by killing Hitler in her own version of \\"The Final Solution.\\" We get to see Lt. Aldo Raine (Pitt) gather a group of ruthless \\"Gnat-see\\" killers and carve swastikas into their foreheads. And finally we get the cream of the crop, Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (Waltz) who's ability to sniff out hiding Jews have given him his title.<br /><br />Without Christoph Waltz and Brad Pitt in their respective roles, I feel this film wouldn't have been a fraction as good as it was; probably a testament to the casting heads. But specifically to Waltz as Landa, who played the slimy Nazi brutalist only interested in saving his own skin by the end of the war. I think he deserved top billing, not Pitt (although Pitt did his usual extraordinarily great job). Waltz was so key to the entire film that he really held the reins of the story throughout its length. And his range of emotions, from anger to giddiness, was astoundingly disturbing. I loved every second he was on-screen. The fact that the Hollywood Foreign Press gave him a Golden Globe for his supporting role was most appropriate (and I noticed he's garnered praise from many other award ceremonies and, I'm hoping, the Academy Award roster will list him this year).<br /><br />Brad Pitt as the countryfied, American Nazi-hunter was great. But most of his notable lines are delivered whenever he's on-screen with Waltz. The ending sequence in the woods with Lt. Raines' knife and Col. Landa's ...umm ...life, are wonderfully vicious.<br /><br />Of course, we cannot leave out French actress Melanie Laurent as the persecuted Shosanna who is forced to watch her family slaughtered by Landa then flee to Paris and blend in with society. Only later does she learn that her new life and career sets her up perfectly to exact revenge on the Nazi party ...and its top leaders; the very top, in fact. She also is forced to fight off the advances of a German soldier whom she finds both endearing and loathsome.<br /><br />By the end of Inglorious Basterds, you feel like you've been on a wild ride at a theme park, until you realize you've never left your seat. It's a remarkable film that is cast exceptionally well. This one's worth owning for sure.he was on-screen.

B00288KNL8|5.0|Coraline is a brilliant movie, and while it has the look of a Tim Burton film, it is superior because Selick is a better storyteller than Burton.  The characters are well developed, and the film has a dreamlike quality that is rare as it is compelling.      It is surprising how many reviewers never get past the dark aspects of the film.  One wonders what they would do with the Brother's Grimm.  It would be a little like someone missing the point of the story of David and Goliath, and can only obsess that, \\"Someone got hit by a rock.\\"    And regarding the big-breasted performers...THOSE WERE COSTUMES...the real performers were thin, fully dressed, and popped out of those costumes.  The POINT was to illustrate how absurd adults look in the eyes of a child.  Amazing how this minor detail seems so elusive to those who are more entertained by misguided moral outrage than honestly watching the film before them.  The film's rating is appropriate.
0451450523|4.0|THREE QUICK POINTS:<br />* Point 1: Nature plays a large role. The textures, the aromas, and the sounds all revolve around the things that grow and thrive in nature; shifting from air to sea to fire to earth to metal, and sometimes intermingling.<br /><br />* Point 2: The unicorn is rather vain, but in such a way that her vanity seems justified. Throughout the text we're reminded that the unicorn is the most beautiful creature, much of which is her own musing, and when she's turned human, she's incredibly distraught because she's mortal and dying, and therefore no longer beautiful.<br /><br />* Point 3: This book is a musical without the sheet music. If anyone had any doubts that Mr. Beagle enjoys writing lyrics, hand them this book. Just about everyone sings something at some point, ranging from the silly and nonsensical to the melancholy.<br /><br />SHORT SYNOPSIS:<br />A unicorn residing in a lilac wood overhears two huntsmen discussing the existence of unicorns. When the unicorn learns that she's the last of her kind, she embarks on a journey to find her kin. On this adventure, she learns about the Red Bull who drove the unicorns away, gets captured in a traveling sideshow, meets a kind and loyal magician named Schmendrick and a woman named Molly Grue who join her journey, is turned into a human, and ultimately learns the truth about the unicorns.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS:<br />If you have no patience for florid language and abstract descriptions, then this is not the book for you.  Nearly every sentence is rife with similes and adjectives and adverbs. In any other story, I'd probably admonish the author, but for The Last Unicorn, it works. It brightened up the narration, even in the dreariest of passages.<br /><br />From the very first page, I was sucked into the fantasy, into a completely different world possibly long ago or existing parallel to this one. Who truly knows? What I do know is that I felt as though I were standing right next to the unicorn throughout her entire journey and meeting the same creatures and people that she did and escaping from the same dangers. In other words, the story felt real. Intellectually I knew the story was fiction, but deep inside, in a place that's usually lost to age, it was completely believable.<br /><br />Each character was built with a perfect balance of strength and weakness. For instance, the unicorn is vain. In the beginning, the vanity seems justified to an extent, but when she's transformed into the Lady Amalthea who now has human emotions and desires, that justifiable vanity becomes arrogance, mainly to disguise her fear. Schmendrick was a good-natured bungling wizard who occasionally had an off day. It was the off days that made him so relatable. And the indomitable Molly Grue, the voice of cool reason and support. Together the characters all complemented each other well.<br /><br />The story had a nice flow, though I will admit some parts tended to slow down, but it wasn't so bad that I could put the book down and never want to pick it up again. The opposite, actually. Those sections gave me a moment to breathe so I could put the book down for the night get some rest and come back to it another day. Frankly, I was glad that the book took a little longer than usual to read because I wanted to prolong the story. Even when it ended I felt a little sad because I wanted to continue on with each character on their journeys.<br /><br />I also need to mention that this is not a typical happily-ever-after fairytale either. A difficult decision needed to be made at the end and it left me a bit heartbroken, but satisfied.and people that she did and escaping from the same dangers. In other words, the story felt real.

0452295548|1.0|What a disappointment this book was. I expected a stirring memoir on how the author survived and recovered from a stroke but instead got a book with very few actual storytelling and non stop repetitive ramblings on controlling your brain and how lucky the author was to get a stroke. She even now thanks her cells when she leaves a dump. No joking, that is actually in the book. What makes it worse is that Jill is a scientist yet this book is nothing more than new age theories that are repeated over and over. Utterly painful and boring to read and one of the worst books this book lover has encountered in years.<br /><br />Ultimately the folks you see giving this book lavish praise are what is referred to as the lowest common denominator. Essentially they are simpletons easily impressed with something that just seems like it reeks of importance.

B0026P3G12|1.0|I received the Susan Boyle CD for Christmas after listening to her performance on YouTube a 100 times.  I didn't listen to the CD until last night because I wanted to wait for the right moment.  But I shouldn't have bothered to wait as I was very disappointed by the album.    The voice on the album sounds nothing like Susan Boyle.  Instead of the clear but mature voice I had come to expect, it was a fluttering sounding voice of a 20 year old.  To me she sounded a lot like an early Madonna.  The choice of songs on the album was interesting and I would have loved to hear the real Susan Boyle do them.  Daydream Believer is a particular favorite but this version sounds like a breathless teenager, not a world weary woman who has been given a new chance.    I probably would like the album well enough on its own if it was by another singer but I can't listen to it now without being bothered by the disconnect between the voice on this album, which is much too high, and the wonderful performance on British TV.

B00019074O|4.0|What do Police Academy (1984) and Amadeus (1984) have in common? Well, apparently they were released in the same year, 1984, and for me, as different as they are; they both belong to the favorites. That's right, 8 times Oscar winner \\"Amadeus\\", the work of Art, the movie that deservingly has made the countless top lists, and the comedy Police Academy which received zero stars from Roger Ebert who called it bad and idiotic. He suggests in his review, \\"It's so bad, maybe you should pool your money and draw straws and send one of the guys off to rent it so that in the future, whenever you think you're sitting through a bad comedy, he could shake his head, and chuckle tolerantly, and explain that you don't know what bad is.\\" Well, I've sat (or at least I tried to sit) through my portion of bad comedies and I swear, the original Police Academy is not bad. I wonder if very respected by this viewer critic ever changed his mind because I personally sat through original PA dozens of times and I like it a lot. I laugh, I have a good time and what is the most amazing thing, I remember the characters' names - it does not happen to me often. I see them all vividly and think of them with the smile - such a colorful crew of misfits who tried to make it to the Police Force. The first and the most charming is of course Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg will be remembered for this role. And for Diner, of course), a repeat offender who was forced to join the police academy as punishment and tried to get kicked out for the first half of the movie. Then there is gun obsessed Tackleberry, David Graf, RIP (Son, where did you get that gun? My mommy gave it to me). Next, the sweet, shy and soft spoken Hooks; the intimidating by his size but gentle ex- florist giant Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), Jones (Michael Winslow),the guy who could imitate any sound possible and make amazingly realistic sound effects using only his mouth; the young and sexy long before she was not so young but still very sexy in the City, Kim Catrell (cadet Thompson), and those two idiots who look like grown up Beavis and Butthead and who were the frequent visitors in The Blue Oyster Bar where they did a lot of dancing, mostly dancing. There were also memorable staff members at Lassard Police Academy, starting with oblivious forgetful Commander Lassard who liked to give the public speeches...with some special help from under the podium. There is very diligent and strict Lt. Harris who took his job in forcing new cadets to quit very seriously. There is also Sgt. Debbie Callahan in the full Valkyrie mood. To make it short - Police Academy is fun, always has been and I believe will be. I've seen it so many times I know the lines by heart and I still watch at least the parts of this classic when they show it on TV. I'll tell you what - the second and the third movies are also funny. In the second, the new character, Zed, a leader of the local gang of punks, (Bobcat Goldthwait with Ozzy -like voice) enters the series, and in the third, the reformed Zed returns as the cadet and has the funniest scenes with Tim Kazurinsky (Sweetchuck). The rest of the series get repetitive and boring but the first three movies still hold tight. Now back to the question in the beginning of my review. What do Police Academy and Amadeus have in common? Both are the winners of the Golden Screen Award which \\"is presented to the distributors of domestic and foreign feature films - including documentary and children films - with more than 3,000,000 admissions within 18 months since their release or re-release in Germany\\". Looks like Police Academy made it internationally, and even more - the second and the third movie also won the same award. So, Mr. Ebert, I think it is the time to admit that Police Academy is very far from being the bad movie not worthy even a star from you. Silly, witless - yes. Bad? Absolutely not.sexy in the City, Kim Catrell (cadet Thompson), and those two idiots who look like grown up Beavis and Butthead and who were the frequent visitors in The Blue Oyster Bar where they did a lot of dancing, mostly dancing.

B00164KYV4|3.0|He's Just Not That Into You is a series of relationship stories that connect throughout the movie.  All are looking for true love and commitment but the clear ardent statement of commitment seems to be missing in all the match-ups.  The relationships are breezy with deeper currents of insecurity or doubt beneath the light banter.  This is more of a chick flick that shows the dating scene and married life as they ebb and flow with time and circumstance.  The stories are interesting and mildly funny.  The honesty factor in relationships is brought out with a sub-story on whether someone really quit smoking cigarettes.  We see the truth at the end of the movie.<br /><br />It was vicariously entertaining to watch the eclectic relationships, which included men who promise to call, women that sit by the phone, married bliss and blindness, and finding a deep commitment.<br />Janine tries to trust her husband, GiGi waits for her true love to call, Alex calls to say she should stop sitting by the phone, Beth is not sure she should continue in a long relationship without marriage, Anna tries to figure out if she wants the married man or her boring regular boyfriend, Conor, who really wants her.  Then there is Mary who has all kinds of gay men at her beck and  call, but wants and needs to find a man who is straight.

Susan is an inspiration for all of us and her lovely voice is a joy to listen to, again and again.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the other reviews that the choice of songs is a bit of a \\"mix\\" but these are probably personal choices that Susan wanted to make sure to include on this her first album. How was she to know at the time where this would all lead to and how popular this album would continue to be week after week. A second album perhaps was still an uncertainty at that point, it certainly isn't now!<br /><br />I'll be watching and listening along with her other millions of fans throughout the world to see what's next for Susan.
B002ZHKZD8|5.0|Movie - 5.0<br /><br />I have to say, when I originally blind-bought The Bourne Trilogy box set on BD, I had no idea what I was in for. I was thoroughly surprised by how well Identity turned out, as it was a very refreshing taste to its genre. It had a genuine sense of mystery and intrigue, and the European atmosphere only made it more exotic. Then, Paul Greengrass came along and took the franchise to new heights by developing a very emotional and symbolic story. But not only did he expand the humanity of Jason Bourne's character, he did so with a grittier, edgier kind of aesthetic. And in reaching the final act of the story, he surpasses even that with not only a more epic plot in the grand scheme of things, but with pure technical proficiency. The story actually backtracks to the end of Supremacy and picks up in Moscow where Bourne (Matt Damon) had just apologized to Irina Neski for killing her parents when he was first assigned as a Treadstone agent. Meanwhile, English journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) is receiving tips that the U.S. government has implemented a new Treadstone-upgrade division called Blackbriar, led by Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). In discovering Ross' interactions, Bourne proceeds to contact him and find his source to answer the last remaining questions of where he came from and who was responsible for these black ops programs to begin with. But upon Ross' assassination, Bourne must make the journey back home with the help of former handler Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) and the benefit of the doubt from CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen).<br /><br />There are so many things that work in Ultimatum's favor to not only make it a masterful spy-thriller, but also a top-class action movie. Setup after setup is executed with pinpoint precision for every major sequence in terms of its brevity, cleverness, and importance to the plot. Not only is the entire film an exhilarating game of cat and mouse as the Blackbriar brass and Bourne match wits, but even the fight scenes and chases surpass everything from its predecessor (as Supremacy did to Identity). Most importantly, though, having cleared his guilty conscience and found atonement with his past, this film is especially adamant about now having Bourne find his roots as a killer, confronting his inner demons, having him accept what he is, and finally allowing him to move on. Damon performs this role flawlessly and shows a great amount of progression as the character of Jason Bourne that's very noticeable if you pay attention between each film. I think a big contribution to that is the way Paul Greengrass lets the actors play on their instincts. His method of film-making is fast-cut, kinetic, and visceral, and I feel it really helped make the Bourne series the franchise it is today. But again, I have to praise the action. Even as a \\"drama-first, action-second\\" kind of series, the level of excitement is so far up on the spectrum for each aspect, that I can't help but be amazed by everything these movies have managed to accomplish. They're smartly-written, wonderfully-produced, and have set the new standard for the genre.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The photography itself is almost exactly the same as it was in Supremacy. Greengrass' visual style and Oliver Wood's lighting really make for a great picture. The differences this time around are: color saturation, which is a little more balanced and not as hot, and the grain is a little less heavy. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the overall tone of the movie isn't as dark as Supremacy and that most of the film is shot during daytime. And because of that, it allows for a lot more detail. Just look at the stunning clarity in overhead and closeup shots. The architecture of all the buildings and streets in London, Tangier, and New York, the pores onpeoples' faces or the fine texturing in their clothes; it's a very subtle difference in the adjustments made, but it's such a marked improvement over something that I already thought looked spectacular to begin with. Colors are still very vibrant, even with the slight drop in saturation. The blues and browns of London, the oranges and greys of Tangier, and the yellows and greens of New York all have a certain charm to the respective atmospheres they create.<br /><br />Blacks are still deep and inky with no signs of crush and show an excellent amount of delineation. My favorite aspect of the video, however, is the contrast. I think this is why the detail is so much more immaculate and makes for a more pleasing image. In fact, I'd say the brightness (and when I say \\"brightness,\\" it's actually not even that much) sets the movie up for a different tone altogether. Supremacy was darker because Bourne was discovering his dark, dirty secrets. But here in Ultimatum, he's essentially coming full circle, going towards the proverbial \\"light,\\" and trying to put an end to the cycle of violence that's followed him since his beginning days as a Treadstone agent. My scenes for reference are any of the overhead shots of the various cities (which has lots of great color), pretty much any closeup dialogue shot (for the subtle detail in the faces and hair), and any interior shot where there's very little light (for the blacks). Once again, the Bourne franchise is treated with a stellar video presentation.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />The Bourne Ultimatum won 2 Oscars for sound. I'm a little baffled as to how it beat Transformers, though it's probably a political thing for the Academy not liking Michael Bay more than anything else, but that's okay. I'll take the Bourne series getting some kind of Academy recognition. Asif Supremacy didn't have enough of an aggressive sound mix, Ultimatum for all intents and purposes even managed to blow that one out of the water. The actual recording volume is a little bit higher, but the separation and directionality are mixed much more intricately. The scene at Waterloo Station is a prime example of how to really immerse an audience in the thick of all the action. You can hear people talking, their footsteps, the intercoms calling, the distant sounds of train signals, the trains themselves, the mechanical advertisements flipping sides at the top of the walls; every little detail is reference volume, abundant in number, and carefully placed in all the correct speakers when needed.<br /><br />Rear speaker activity, in particular, gets a great workout as there are a greater amount of scenes with crowds in the background. Much like Waterloo Station, the bustling crowd in Tangier and passers-by in New York really add a unique level of depth to a character that normally thrives on blending in and being clandestine. Blockbuster-type sound effects such as gunshots, car crashes, and other loud noises are phenomenal when they happen. The car chase towards the end is extremely chaotic and possesses a quality to it that's almost a bit jarring. LFEs are most prominent here when Bourne's car is driven right into the guard rail. And then there are my always-favorite isolation cues. I loved the scene in Supremacy when Bourne was fighting the last Treadstone agent because of its quiet and enclosed nature. The silence only amplified what was already a very intense action sequence, and I was especially happy they were able to make that effect even better when Bourne fights Desh. The sounds of glass crashing, props breaking, and the thumps and slaps of their hands and feet are amazing to listen to. Chalk up another perfect audio presentation.<br /><br />Extras - 3.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />As he did with Supremacy, Greengrassoffers up another excellent and very informative commentary. First and foremost, he talks about Damon masterfully pulling off a a more tempered version of Jason Bourne and how the character has evolved since his appearance in the first film. Throughout, Greengrass also continues to break down crucial plot points giving great analysis, not just of Bourne, but of supporting characters, how they fit into the story, and the growing conspiracy within Blackbriar. Additionally, he also stresses the importance of setting the film's tempo very high right from the start. He compares it to \\"a really nice sports car that you have to keep steady, but must also know when to speed it up,\\" or something to that degree. And as much of a technical marvel as Ultimatum turned out to be, I wholeheartedly agree with his assessment. He talks about how in a thriller that the setup for any kind of sequence is the most important thing to execute, otherwise you lose the audience, and the twist is for nothing. He also talks about the logistics of shooting every now and then, but for the most part stays very focused talking about how he wanted to convey the tone of the movie through its action.<br /><br />- Deleted Scenes (SD; 12:22)<br />Again, not much to talk about.<br /><br />- Be Bourne Spy Training<br />Another kind of novelty application that shows you 5 movie clips and tests your ability for visual memorization, much like how Bourne was able to scan a room and tell you a bunch of stuff when he was in the diner in Identity.<br /><br />- Man on the Move: Jason Bourne (SD; 23:58 altogether)<br />Provides a break down of the different locations they shot at. Interestingly enough, the scenes in Moscow for this film were actually shot in east Berlin because it was January at the time of filming and everything in Moscow was too cold to shoot (and probably froze everything over). Meanwhile, London was one of the more difficult sets to shoot, as it was one of the more crowded sequences. It took 5months just to secure all the logistics, and even then a lot of the people you see in those shots weren't extras because they couldn't completely shut the station down (for obvious reasons). The same goes for Tangier. In fact, they were shooting during Ramadan, which forced a lot of the cast and crew to fast with everyone else. Below are the cities broken up individually:<br /><br />- Berlin (6:10)<br />- Paris (3:41)<br />- London (4:14)<br />- Madrid (4:06)<br />- Tangier (5:45)<br /><br />- Roof Pursuit (SD; 5:39)<br />Shows the work they had to do in constructing zip line camera rigs for the sequence, as well as how they managed to turn a stuntman into a JumpCam operator when Bourne is jumping off a building and through a window.<br /><br />- Planning the Punches (SD; 4:59)<br />Starts off with Joey Ansah (who played Desh) talking about how he's skilled in Capoeira and that the studio was going to teach him something else. The feature then shows coordinator Jeff Imada talking about Filipino Kali (once again), and then they show the setup of Damon and Ansah's scene with the rubber props they put around for safety.<br /><br />- Driving School (SD; 3:23)<br />Pretty self-explanatory. Just shows us how Damon prepped for some of the stunt driving. He's actually pretty good at it.<br /><br />- New York Chase (SD; 10:46)<br />Mainly talks about how staging a giant car chase sequence in New York City was a logistics nightmare and that it required a lot of planning to get things situated. There's not a whole lot of actual interviewing, just mostly footage of them setting stuff up and shooting the scene.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />4 different interactive applications to play along with the movie:<br /><br />- Volkswagon: Get More Info<br />Specs and information on the VW Toureg V10 TDI. This would've been great if I were playing Gran Turismo.<br /><br />- Blackbriar Files<br />Like Treadstone Files in the first movie and The Bourne Dossier in the second, it's a high-tech simulator that displays a bunch of statistics and information on people, places, and other things. It's cool to look at, but again, it's just a novelty.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />Also like the first two films, this repeats important plot information to the point of redundancy. Skip it.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />Much less effort was put into this feature as compared to Supremacy. The PiP commentaries only total a little over 35 minutes and are spread out over 12 of the 20 chapters. They're fairly informative, but the lower quantity is a bit disappointing. Some of the topics covered are: character analyses/interpretations, shooting logistics, general opinions about the franchise and its success, and a few anecdotes and stories about working with one another. Might be worth a watch at some point, but it's not nearly as engaging as it could've been.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />So the story of Jason Bourne has reached its conclusion, and in grand, epic fashion. Throughout the journey we watched as he re-discovered himself and took down a deeply corrupted system. It's bittersweet in a way, but it was enjoyable, nonetheless. The BD presents The Bourne Ultimatum with absolutely pristine picture and sound. And while the extra features are a lot lighter than the previous two films, it at least provides an excellent commentary that should satisfy the die-hard Bourne fan. If you haven't seen any of these films yet and are in the mood for an awesome spy-thriller, definitely give this franchise a shot.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I have only saw this movie once when I was a little kid but sense then I have been wanting to see it again. And the reason why is because ever sense I first saw it I loved it & I always will.
B002ZHKZCO|5.0|Movie - 4.0<br /><br />When this movie initially came out, I was very reluctant to see it. I had this weird and stupid bias against Matt Damon for whatever reason I can't even remember now, but that's in the past. Once I got wise, though, my very first viewing of this film (as well as the rest of the trilogy) came in the form of their BD releases. That being said, I was pleasantly surprised, especially for this being the first of three parts in an overall story. The film begins with the discovery of a man in the ocean by a group of fishermen; a man with two bullet holes in his back, a Swiss bank account number in his hip, and no memory of who he is. He can fluently speak foreign languages and is apparently a master in firearms and fisticuffs, but still can't remember his name or how he ended up where he did. In reaching the Swiss bank, he finds a deposit box with a passport. The name inside: Jason Bourne (Matt Damon). Also in the box are multiple other passports, all with the same picture, but different names. And so, Bourne embarks on a journey to find out who he really is, meeting a gypsy woman named Marie (Franka Potente), in which they face assassins and conspiracy coverups with only each other to depend on.<br /><br />For me, this movie not only re-defined the spy-thriller genre (James Bond should thank this franchise because I think his recent incarnation was really influenced by it), but it made me a huge fan of Matt Damon. It's a gritty, more realistic, and down-to-earth depiction that relies less on flash and pizazz and tells a very humanistic story. If I were to break it down, I would say the appeal comes from about a third in the writing, a third in the acting, and a third in the score. The writing succeeds a lot in terms of subtlety; it doesn't explain a whole lot, but leaves enough for the audience to understand and empathize Bourne without ever getting ahead of him. This, in turn, is brilliantly performed by Damon who's portrayal is just as subtle as the writing; he's cool, calm, and collected, yet carries a certain degree of violence and ferocity when his training kicks in. And then there's the music; John Powell creates a very engaging score with three particularly crucial elements that, in my opinion, really drive the film: Bourne's main theme (which adds a sense of mystery and intrigue), a lot of percussion pieces (which sound great for action sequences), and the trademark whirring effect (that foreshadows Bourne's time to kick ass). The Bourne Identity is a very well-made spy-thriller that, as director Doug Liman puts it, \\"is made with a lot of European sensibilities,\\" making this a very refreshing take for the time it was made. Not only does it provide the mystery and action of a spy movie, but the additional cerebral aspect makes it that much more enjoyable. And it only gets better in the sequels.<br /><br />Video - 4.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />The Bourne franchise makes its first entry onto high definition with a pretty good transfer. I say \\"pretty good,\\" which may seem a bit generous considering a couple of gripes I have with it, but all in all, I'd say the pros outweigh the cons. Let's start with the good. General detail and sharpness look great, capturing some excellent scenic shots, revealing a decent amount of line delineation between clothes and objects, and showing some of the finer features on peoples' faces and hair during closeup shots. Colors are vivid, albeit slightly de-saturated, with lots of reds and orange being at the forefront of the spectrum. The red bank bag that Bourne wears around the beginning of the film tends to especially stand out, along with the occasional random red object in the background. The jacket he also wears in the beginning and the one big explosion that the movie has literally explodes orange when it does happen. Skin tones are very lifelike with great variation from person to person and reflect accordingly depending on the lighting of the scene. Black levels aren't super-deep, but do enough to help accentuate the intrigue during darker scenes or nighttime shots. The film also supports a nice, light layer of grain and never gets in the way.<br /><br />The two bad things? Contrast and damage. Contrast is generally a tad on the low side giving the movie a kind of murky look with even daytime shots looking a little on the dim side. The detail is still good enough, but compared to other movies I've seen with low contrast that still manage to have a pristine picture, this one doesn't really hold up. Throughout the course of the movie, there are also various instances of dirt and even one or two moments where scratches from print damage popped up for a split second. They're not terribly obvious, but they are noticeable. In the end, though, Oliver Wood's photography looks great and really helps to maintain a very earthy, yet exotic look to the cityscapes, indoor sets, and wider-viewed shots. My favorite parts to look at are the snowy streets of Zurich for it's variation in color around the city, the shootout at the farmhouse for its detail, and the nighttime shots around the end of the movie for the blacks.<br /><br />Audio - 4.5<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />While the video portion of this disc isn't quite perfect, the audio comes much closer. As I mentioned about the music being an integral part of the film, interestingly enough, the movie opens with the Universal credits, but doesn't play the Universal theme. Instead, it's starts out silent and fades into the sound effects, then into the main title theme of Bourne. General immersion is excellent with the score having a pulse of its own through a lot of the drumming beats and tense string pieces. And then, of course, there's that trademark whirring effect, which when played, really enhances the mood of whatever is acting out on screen. Directionality and separation dominate the sound field when action sequences take precedent, though dialogue thankfully remains clear regardless of how loud a crash, gunshot, or broken window gets.<br /><br />In particular, I was very pleased with how well-isolated the effects were in the scene where Bourne is fending off the first Treadstone assassin. When the guy breaks in, it was completely quiet beforehand, and then all hell broke loose. But even then, when Bourne and Marie are being pursued by the French police, the car chase sequence does a bit of the opposite by having a very lively mix of automotive chaos and snazzy Euro-techno that almost felt like a scene out of The Transporter. I would say this scene utilizes the rear speakers best with some very aggressive effects as some of the cars come buzzing around tight corners and others start crashing into one another. And then towards the end of the film when Bourne is fighting Clive Owen's character, we get a great example of the middle road. It's isolated enough like the first assassination attempt when Bourne blows up a tanker providing some real pounding LFEs, but then it also feels very immersive when he fires another shot and the birds in the field start flying around. To sum it up, The Bourne Identity has a great sound design and mix. The actual sound quality has a lot of depth to it, with both the high and low ends displaying great dynamic range. As a whole, it's not quite reference material, but I would liken that more to the nature of the film itself having a lot of quieter moments. But rest assured, though, that the sequels will definitely fix that right up.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Doug Liman)<br />This is a very informative track with a wealth of information that covers a wide variety of aspects from the writing, casting, filming, set designs, editing,scoring; you name it. Essentially, what I found most interesting were the comments Liman had about the heart of the story and its presentation; namely, how he wanted to bring a sense of grit and realism to the spy-thriller genre, making it a drama, first, and an action film, second. He goes into great detail about the depiction of Bourne and how he and Damon collaborated to make the character feel subtle and empathetic, yet strong and determined throughout the circumstances of the story. In fact, Liman really stressed the parallels between the Kali fighting style that Bourne uses and how its core philosophy of energy conservation and quick, brutal efficiency ties into Bourne's overall demeanor. He later goes on to talk about character motivations and how Damon and Potente did particularly good jobs at humanizing the character of Bourne in such a way that, I feel, had a gradual impact on the look and feel of other modern spy-thrillers succeeding this one (here's looking at you, Bond). Oddly enough, there were a few very large dead spots, but for the most part, when Liman talks, he really lets loose.<br /><br />- The Ludlum Identity (SD; 12:49)<br />Tells us a little bit about the famed author of the series, Robert Ludlum, namely, things like: how he made the transition from theater actor to novelist, how he tied those theater experiences into his writing, how a lot of the locales he came up with were inspired by post WWII-Europe, how he saw conspiracy in authority, and finally how he came to adopt the trend of 3-word titles for all of his works (\\"The [whatever] [whatever]\\").<br /><br />- The Ludlum Supremacy (SD; 12:41)<br />Talks about the origin of Bourne's name, Ludlum's personality in general and how it was reflected through the character of Bourne, some of the differences between the movie and novel (such as the omission of Carlos the Jackal), how The Bourne Identity boosted his status as an author, and then the eventual progression that was a result from Identity's success.<br /><br />- The Ludlum Ultimatum (SD; 23:57)<br />This piece covers a pretty huge chunk of Jason Bourne's story arc between the first and second movie. If you've seen all the films by this point, then it's an excellent breakdown of the character, his motivations, and the themes they wrote into the plot. If by some chance this is your first time seeing Identity, do no watch this feature, as it will contain some major spoilers for Supremacy.<br /><br />- Alternate Opening and Ending (SD; 10:46 altogether)<br />Starts with a brief introduction by the 3 guys listed below and mentions how the movie had to be adjusted after the events of 9/11 for the sake of changed sensibilites. They were concerned about the \\"datedness\\" of the subject material and how it would make audiences react. The alternate opening basically would have turned the whole movie into a flashback and tying up in present day at the end. They say they were pretty happy with the ending you see in the final cut (and so am I).<br /><br />- Introduction with Producer Frank Marshall, Co-Writer Tony Gilroy, and Actor Brian Cox (3:33)<br />- Alternate Opening (2:16)<br />- Alternate Ending (4:56)<br /><br />- Deleted Scenes (SD; 6:58)<br />Listed below are the individual scenes:<br /><br />- Wombosi on the Private Jet (0:59)<br />- Bourne and Marie by the Side of the Road (2:29)<br />- Psychologist Discusses Bourne (1:46)<br />- Bourne and Marie Practice on Subway (1:42)<br /><br />- Extended Farmhouse Scene (0:58)<br />Liman actually makes a quick reference to this in the commentary. He said this scene was left in the European version of the film, but then went on to say it was cut from the American version for \\"timing reasons.\\" As if 58 seconds really makes that big of a difference in theater showings per day...<br /><br />- The Birth of the Bourne Identity (SD; 14:31)<br />A pretty generic EPK-style feature that tells you how Bourne is different from your average spy-thrill title. It has very badly-edited interviews that are short and whose sporadic nature doesn't really tell you much at all. I recommend you avoid this if you're looking for actual depth and quality.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind: Robert Ludlum (SD; 5:44)<br />Mostly recycled information talking about Ludlum's transition from theater to writing. It offers a little more retrospect after the fact, but it's too short and not much more than you can hear about in the other features above.<br /><br />- Access Granted: An Interview with Co-Writer Tony Gilroy (SD; 4:03)<br />Talks about the essence of Bourne and how the movies had to be adapted for modern times, as opposed to the Cold War mentality they originally had when it started in the '80s.<br /><br />- From Identity to Supremacy: Jason & Marie (SD; 3:37)<br />Some interviews with Damon and Potente about the characters they play, how they interpreted their motivations, and the transition they had to make when filming Supremacy. Damon said that Bourne's actions are what he feels develops the character, while Potente praises how non-cliché her character was and how the chemistry between Bourne and Marie is sporadic throughout the relationship.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (SD; 3:25)<br />Talks about the actual medical condition of the amnesia Bourne suffers in the plot. The psychologist basically says that Bourne suffers from Selective Dissociative Amnesia, but retains a Kinesthetic Memory of how to perform all of his trained skills. He also goes on to point out that the presence of Marie's character was a big help in portraying memory recovery.<br /><br />- Cloak and Dagger: Covert Ops (SD; 5:31)<br />An interview with an officer of the CIA who talks about the overt and covert operations they actually do perform and how accurate the depiction of Bourne and all the training technicalities were.<br /><br />- Inside a Fight Sequence (SD; 4:42)<br />Shows how the choreography was staged with stunt coordinator Nick Powell.<br /><br />- Moby \\"Extreme Ways\\" Music Video (SD; 3:38)<br />A music video to the ending credits song.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />There are 3 different interactive applications you can play along with the film:<br /><br />- Treadstone Files<br />A kind of gimmicky computerization that simulates certain parts of the movie to feel like you're looking through a high-tech dossier. It shows a bunch of trivial factoids and statistics about the characters, the locations, Treadstone, and all kinds of other information.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />PiP that plays like Warner Bros.' Maximum Movie Mode where the current scene and an older scene that may or may not contain interviews will split into 2 individual screens of their own and essentially rehash important plot points.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />A true PiP application that opens up a little box in the corner of the screen with additional interviews not seen in the special features. Altogether, it equates to about 25 minutes and is divided into 8 chapters of the scene selection. Some of the material covered includes: the action and how Damon wanted to do his own stunts, filming in Paris, Liman casting Damon as Bourne and what it was like working with him, the relationship between Bourne and Marie, a more in-depth analysis of Marie's character, and a short look at the other Treadstone agents through an interview with Clive Owen. It's a little disappointing there aren't more interviews, but it's pretty well-worth the information.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5<br /><br />For the starter of the bunch, The Bourne Identity is a very entertaining refresher into, what was then, a faltering spy-thriller genre. This Blu-ray disc looks pretty good with only a couple of minor problems, the sound is fantastic considering there's more drama than action, and the special features are very informative. It's a shame Ludlum never got to see this, but the people that knew and vouched for him are pretty happy with the way it turned out. TheBourne franchise has certainly changed the genre (just look at how Daniel Craig's Bond movies have shaped up) and for the better. If you haven't seen this yet, definitely pick it up, then wait to be amazed by its sequels.
1423101472|5.0|I am reading this series with my 12 year old and absolutely love them all.  Riordan is a great writer and all have been page turners.  I especially like the fact that he does not spend half the subsequent books describing what has happened in the previous ones!  Every book is something new and magical and exciting!
B002ZHKZCY|5.0|Movie - 5.0<br /><br />As I said in my review of the first film, I stand by the belief that the Bourne franchise has ultimately changed the face of spy-thriller movies forever. Sure, the occasional flashy James Bond flick was fun to watch, but there's only so much style you can take after a while till it becomes a bit redundant. Thankfully, these Bourne films were so successful that they were able to re-imagine Agent 007 in a different light, a dark, grittier one that you can clearly see in their current films since Daniel Craig took over the title. But that's beside the point. The point is that I'm really, really thankful because if Doug Liman and Paul Greengrass never directed these, who knows what kind of mediocrity we'd be having to put up with instead. The Bourne Supremacy opens up 2 years after the end of Identity. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) and Marie (Franka Potente) are living in Goa supposedly out of the grasp of anyone looking to find them. Bourne has recently begun having nightmares about a man and woman he once assassinated, but still can't manage to piece together anything else relevant between that and his past days in Treadstone. Meanwhile, an operation in Berlin to uncover a mole amongst the top CIA brass, led by Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), goes south when a Russian federal agent, Kirill (Karl Urban), infiltrates the deal and takes out the informant while leaving a fingerprint of Bourne to cover his tracks. Then in an attempt to put Bourne out of the picture, Marie is killed in his stead. Grieved and angered by the loss, Bourne sets out to find those responsible. However, in his pursuit of vengeance, he would discover things about his past that would change him for the better.<br /><br />The Bourne Identity was a refreshing breath of fresh air showing us a man who, at one point, was a cold-blooded killer doing his duty, but upon certain events had a change of heart. A major reason for that was because of a woman he met, a woman that stayed with him and showed him the side of life he had been missing out on. Upon losing her, this man would once again fall into the web of coverups, deception, and lies in search of truth, retribution, and eventual redemption. As if Identity didn't establish the humanity within Bourne enough, Supremacy takes that aspect even further by provoking an act of pure, motivated revenge, that otherwise evolves into a search for inner peace and a realization of humility. With this being the first of director Paul Greengrass' installments, the pacing of both the plot and action are doubly intensified. In addition, the cinematography, fight and stunt choreography, music, and production easily surpass its predecessor. The camera cuts are as quick and vicious as Bourne's ability to take people out, the fights more brutal, the chases more adrenaline-pumping, the music more pulsating, and best of all, the story more symbolic. This definitely takes care of the emotional side of the story arc, and even then, the final part of trilogy will manage to surpass that. Keep going, you're almost done.<br /><br />Video - 5.0<br /><br />- Video codec: VC-1<br />- Video resolution: 1080p<br />- Aspect ratio: 2.35:1<br />- Original aspect ratio: 2.39:1<br /><br />Same director of photography, different director for the movie. The result: an amazing and visceral image compared to the first one! Paul Greengrass did a superb job not only propelling the franchise to new heights with the story, but also with the aesthetic presentation. Black levels are very deep (maybe a little too deep for some) making that sense of mystery and intrigue established in Identity that much more mysterious and intriguing. Even as hot and bright as the colors are in the Goa scenes, the blacks and more balanced contrast give the overall image so much more definition. The colors, by the way, are quite bold this time around. Goa alone has an exuberant amount of reds, oranges, and browns that make you feel like you're in theheat with Bourne and Marie. And even with a very fine layer of grain, detail and sharpness remain intact. Just look a the sweat running down the characters' faces, the texturing in the trees, ground objects, and street markets. And only a fraction of the movie even takes place here.<br /><br />The journey to Berlin is considerably darker, with a lot of the backdrops having more opaque set pieces, more interior shots (with small rooms and such), and a few more scenes shot at nighttime. The black levels are amazing here, but there's surprisingly a sparse amount of noise and grain to get in the way. And finally, the last part of the film in Moscow has a lot of color differentiation. The car chase sequence displays excellent detail in terms of line delineation and object clarity, especially when things start crashing and parts, glass, and other debris go flying around the street. My favorite shots for reference are the scene in Goa when Kirill is standing on the beach looking for Bourne (lots of color), the scene in Munich when Bourne pays a visit to the sole remaining Treadstone agent (lots of grain, but also lots of detail considering how close up the shots are), and finally the car chase in the Moscow tunnel (a little dim, but not super-dark, and again, lots of grain and detail). Some people may think the grain is a bit excessive, but I love the filmic texture it adds. And because of that I can't find any fault in the video.<br /><br />Audio - 5.0<br /><br />Languages<br />- English: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1<br />- French: DTS 5.1<br />- Spanish: DTS 5.1<br /><br />Subtitles<br />- English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />In conjunction with the newer cinematography, the sound is also vastly improved. While the quality in Identity was pretty top-notch itself, there weren't enough moments for it to truly shine. The design and mixing in Supremacy, however, is quite aggressive. The biggest upgrade I noticed immediately is the general immersion. Scenes like the bustling streets of Goa or the protest rally at Alexanderplatz offer all kinds of separation and directionality. You can hear individual vehicles making noise, people talking, the change in volume when objects are in the way, the transference of sounds when the camera pans or cuts to a different angle, and these aren't even the real action sequences. Stuff like the foot chase in Berlin and the car chase in Moscow offer even more sonic perfection in terms of subtlety, dynamic range, and overall buoyancy. My favorite aspects of the audio, though, are its isolation, and the way the music is used. Particularly, I really love the scene where Bourne fights the last Treadstone agent. There's absolutely no music here, and the fight itself is contained in this small little area where you can hear every punch, shuffle, footstep, knife swipe, and paper slap without a single exterior source to disturb it. I personally think this is the most intense scene of the entire film, and a lot of it has to do with the sound, or lack thereof.<br /><br />And then there's the music. The more I keep listening to the score and sampling all the various parts of the movie for reference, the more I'm starting to like John Powell. As a composer, he really lets loose here with the strings and drums. The level at which the music is played is as subtle as the movie's sound effects, and when the pieces actually are played, it really puts you in the scene. LFEs are especially pounding, as the score pulsates and propels the action. Meanwhile, the car chase is probably the other big sequence to pay attention to. The cars running into each other and crashing offer up some pretty good rumbles that, if you have a decent sound system, should provide plenty of room-shaking bass. And yes, like the story itself, the sound gets even better in Ultimatum.<br /><br />Extras - 4.5<br /><br />- Audio Commentary (Director Paul Greengrass)<br />This is a much different commentary than what Doug Liman gave for Identity. While Liman talked a lot about the technical aspects of the filming, Greengrass goes very in-depth about the writing and how he wanted to present certain themes/ideas through the action, especially in the way it was shot. A lot of people complain about the shaky camerawork and quick editing, but Greengrass repeatedly emphasizes how he wanted to keep it \\"real\\" (which is also presented as a short featurette on its own in the special features). In allowing the cameras to be handheld and literally follow Bourne's character in everything he does, its intent is to put the audience with him, as well as give the film a more gritty feel. He constantly breaks down key moments of the film as they unfold and goes on to talk about the actors, namely, why he cast them, what he liked about them, and how their personalities reflected well in their characters. There were a few more dead spots in this commentary than there were with Liman's, but it's just as informative and worth a listen.<br /><br />- Explosive Deleted Scenes (SD; 10:46)<br />Not much to say about them.<br /><br />- Matching Identities: Casting (SD; 5:23)<br />Talks about the casting. Greengrass starts off by giving Damon high praise for his ability to play both sides of Bourne so well (the tortured soul, and the ruthless killer). He also says he liked the choice of Allen to play Landy, as he thinks she's quite classy, much like Chris Cooper was for his role in Identity. He then goes on to talk about the film not having one bad guy, but that they were all part of a bad system (which will become very important for the third film).<br /><br />- Keeping it Real (SD; 4:58)<br />Talks about the process of selecting Greengrass to become the new director of the franchise. He says he wanted to portray a truthfulness and realism, which shows through the shaky-camera cinematography. He also makes the point of not wanting the actors to think too much so that their movements are more instinctual and intense.<br /><br />- Blowing ThingsUp (SD; 4:00)<br />Shows how they blew up the house in Munich and how they didn't us any CG because they wanted more realism to it. Interestingly enough, they got the whole shot in just one take.<br /><br />- On the Move with Jason Bourne (SD; 4:45)<br />Takes a look at the scouting and talks about how they wanted to film the real places in Europe for the film. Berlin was chosen for its historical relevance and as an homage to old spy stories. Moscow was chosen because the city itself has never really been used for movies and because Greengrass felt it gave off a vibe of truthfulness. And then Goa was chosen because it reflected the exuberance and restlessness represented in Bourne's character at that moment in the film.<br /><br />- Bourne to be Wild: Fight Training (SD; 4:21)<br />Shows us the staging for the fight between Bourne and the last remaining Treadstone agent. Fight coordinator Jeff Imada goes over the basic concept of the Kali style used, Greengrass points out how he wanted to really use Venetian blinds for the aesthetic of the scene and that he wanted the fight too look sloppy and raw, yet structured at the same time.<br /><br />- Crash Cam: Racing Through the Streets of Moscow (SD; 5:58)<br />Shows us how the riveting car chase sequence was filmed. They wanted this to be better than the one in Identity by putting a sense of desperation in Bourne to get to his destination, and they did so by making all the cameras either loose or handheld and putting them either in the car or very close to the windows.<br /><br />- The Go-Mobile Revs Up the Action (SD; 6:49)<br />Talks about the Go-Mobile, a camera rig that essentially attaches itself to the front end of a vehicle to put an actor right in the action of a car-driving sequence. They say it's built to be safe (with a very low center of gravity so it never tips over) and that it allows for a lot of different camera angles you wouldn't normally be able to get.<br /><br />- Anatomy of a Scene: The ExplosiveBridge Chase Scene (SD; 4:40)<br />A look at how the foot chase in Berlin was filmed. Damon says shooting it was safe and fun.<br /><br />- Scoring with John Powell (SD; 4:46)<br />I love when we can actually take a look at the scoring of a film, especially here because I feel the music in the Bourne series is such an important driving force. Powell says he doesn't conduct, but likes to offer a lot of input during the process. He also says the score itself re-uses a lot of the themes from the first film, but that the new one created for Goa is meant to represent Marie and that it follows Bourne around till the end of the movie. Specifically, it's a theme that plays during her funeral scene, then comes full circle to symbolize his eventual atonement.<br /><br />- The Bourne Mastermind (Part 2) (SD; 4:42)<br />More rehashed interviews with Ludlum that you might have already seen if you watched the ones on Identity. There's a little more additional retrospect here, but not much else.<br /><br />- The Bourne Diagnosis (Part 2) (SD; 5:39)<br />Gives us a little more psychological analysis on Bourne, most notably how his flashbacks are tormenting him and how Marie represents his humanity and the choice of living. And upon her death, his quest for revenge sets Bourne on a journey to find his past and some eventual answers to what's been troubling him.<br /><br />- U-Control<br />More interactive PiP applications that play during the film:<br /><br />- The Bourne Dossier<br />Same as the Treadstone Files option in Identity. It's just a bunch of statistics and factoids in the form of a gimmicky spy computer thingy for people, places, and certain situations. It's cool if you like trivia, but like I said, it's a bit of a novelty, if anything else.<br /><br />- Bourne Orientation<br />Recaps of important plot points, though not in the sense of interviews like the actual PiP commentary. It's a bit redundant and totally okay to skip it.<br /><br />- Picture in Picture<br />The real meat of the extras. It's actually quite humorous at the beginning when producer Frank Marshall says that the feature was made exclusively for \\"this HD-DVD,\\" which obviously is a dead format now, but after that it's pure gold in terms of information. The PiP takes most of the footage from the other special features listed above. However, it also includes a very large amount of interviews and footage not included in said extras and is full of crucial commentary and analysis of the story itself, as well as a few anecdotes from cast and crew. Most of the feature has the actors breaking down their characters and talking about what it was like working with one another. I was very glad to hear interpretations from Brian Cox and Karl Urban, who play antagonists, but really don't get a whole lot of screen time in general to fully develop themselves. So to hear them talking about how the characters fit into the plot and what they thought about their roles was very interesting. This is by far the best special feature on this disc, and I wholly recommend you make it a mandatory watch if you're interested in the production of the film itself and its literary composition. And unlike the PiP in Identity, this one actually runs for the entire length of the movie, as opposed to 3-5 minute chunks for 8 chapters.<br /><br />Overall - 5.0<br /><br />While the franchise is changing directors at this point, the plot still continues to thicken. I find it to be an interesting take on the character of Jason Bourne. And to further iterate, I really, really thank the people involved because without the Bourne movie franchise, James Bond wouldn't have followed suit, and I don't think I would love the Daniel Craig movies as much as I do today. In the meantime, Universal presents Supremacy with some demo-worthy A/V specs and a deceptively informative set of extras. Do yourself a favor and get ready for a spy-thriller with a lot of heart, then prepare for an even more thrilling adventure in the final act, Ultimatum.

B001JE25ZE|4.0|Pros: Alright, so this guy can write. He can even write well, most of the time. Good. He can even write well and manage not to contradict established scientific facts. Great. He writes well, pens good action sequences, and creates witty dialog. Amazing! But is he among the best? Man, there are a few short stories in here that are nothing short of gold, just gold. He spares not the details nor the mood, and the characters are seductively real. He has sympathy for the feminine persona that is dynamic and believable. He sticks to the story as opposed to weird tangents that have nothing to do with anything. Yes, he's really really good.<br /><br />Cons: The \\"weakest\\" section of this collection is the novella \\"I am Legend.\\" Yes it is worthy of the title of classic as it does vampires right yet again (Twilight, this ain't) with a fresh perspective that is necessary when you reuse a classic image like the vampire. Its weak point is its main character. Perhaps realistically, he fumbles about quite a bit and has deep emotional problems that prevent him from taking care of things until crisis is inevitable. This is a little more distracting that I would've liked, for I was fascinated by the vampire plague the author masterfully constructs and with a flawed lens, there are some things that we never get around to. Fortunately, this isn't the only story with the undead in it.<br /><br />Summary: These days, we take horror survival techniques for granted, but in the 1950s when this was written, they'd only just passed the golden age of film horror. Goth subculture predecessors like the Munsters and the Addams Family hadn't hit the scene yet. Horror was presented by the likes of Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, and Vincent Price. For its time, this survival-horror genre book, with accompanying short stories featuring so many psychic and apocalyptic visions, is a real rarity and genuinely good despite its age. It stands well above most of its contemporaries, such as Psycho by Robert Bloch or The Haunting of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. And, not to be a spoiler, none of the movies do it credit - NONE.ng of Hill House by Shirley Jackson. And, not to be a spoiler, none of the movies do it credit - NONE.
B002B7SAZW|4.0|I have been waiting for a misstep from Weiner and Co. regarding one of the best shows on television. On the opening sequence of this episode I was greeted by some modernist indie rock tripe in a fairly nice series of frames. Anything that can make Joan Holloway seem trite is not very awesome. Please, producers of Mad Men, never use 2007 indie rock music to set the stage for a drama set in the 1960s. Music was so much better then and the music from the time period really sets a mood. Listening to this Decemberists track as the ladies got dressed was like sitting in a bath of ice cold urine. Part of this show's charm is the dedication to mood, character, tone, and style. I find myself thinking, \\"People even talked differently then...even the lilt and song of their voices was different.\\" Mad Men is a great drama, a great period piece, and an example of television poetry. Please do not try and pull a \\"Tarantino\\" and squash time periods together for hipness' sake. It doesn't work when the rest of the show is so strong and well conceived. The RJD2 theme is fitting as a theme, but in the context of the show, please stick to the classics.
B001JDPPDY|3.0|Pros: This is more material from a beloved author, including a long essay and quite a few poems. The poems, entitled collectively \\"The Adventures of Tom Bombadil,\\" are actually pretty good. I guess the early 20th century was a good time for poetry all around. Tree and Leaf, another short story included, was also good, simple but not saccharine and oddly dystopian.<br /><br />Cons: As a collection, this book is disjointed. Each of the should be enjoyed individually. Also, Mr. Tolkien has a propensity to draw out things which should be short. The essay seems to promise things that it never gets around to. Farmer Giles of Ham has such a short plot that it's almost worth skipping, as most of the results are predictable and take forever to arrive. Even the collection of poems has an odd introduction talking about the fictional \\"real\\" authors that goes on for 5 pages in a way that doesn't make a whole lot of sense out of the context of the Lord of the Rings, even though the poems are great on their own.<br /><br />Conclusion: This is well worth the time, though you may find yourself trying to make it go faster in places.
B002VPE1AM|3.0|I saw James Cameron's \\"Avatar\\" on its opening weekend.  With all of the hype surrounding the film I expected it to be either A) one of the greatest films ever made or B) just another visual feast with a hollow plot.  It turns out that it was actually a visual feast with a plot stuffed to the brink with borrowed ideas from other films including many of Cameron's own previous projects.<br /><br />The film's basic plot is that a human mining company has arrived on Pandora, home to the Na'vi, in order to mine unobtanium, an extremely valuable mineral.  The head of the mining operation, Selfridge (Giovanni Ribisi), has determined that the blue-skinned Na'vi must move in order for mining of Pandora to continue.  However, the Na'vi have no plans to leave the sacred forest in which they live.  In order to appease the Na'vi and attempt to persuade them to leave peacefully, the Avatar program is established.  This program uses genetically engineered human/Na'vi beings that can be remotely controlled by a mental link established with a human host.<br /><br />Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), is a paraplegic Marine who is brought into the Avatar program when his twin brother dies and a genetic match is needed for his avatar.  Despite resistance from the program's director, Dr. Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake is allowed take his brother's place.  While on a mission, Jake is separated from the rest of the team he is on and must fend for himself in the very deadly and very beautiful jungles of Pandora.<br /><br />The mining company, meanwhile, has grown tired of the peaceful attempts to move the Na'vi.  Under Colonel Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a massive force is built up to physically and/or fatally remove the Na'vi from their homes.<br /><br />While lost in the jungle, Jake befriends Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a Na'vi princess.  Eventually, Jake befriends Neytiri and a bond begins to form between him and the rest of the Na'vi.<br /><br />Quaritch sees Sully's friendship with the Na'vi as a way to learn of their weaknesses in order to make a military strike successful.  At this point, Sully becomes a double-agent for the military and the Avatar program.  He also begins to fall in love with Neytiri and her people.  Soon enough, Jake finds himself torn between the people he has learned to love and the military that he was once part of.  His ultimate decision might prove fatal not only for himself, but the Na'vi as well.<br /><br />Of course, that's the plot on the surface.  If one reads any other reviews or watches anything about \\"Avatar\\" on television, they will soon find people arguing that the film is everything from a \\"white guilt fantasy\\" to an anti-military rant to an environmentalist's plea and beyond.  While I can see sound reasoning for most of these arguments and do agree with some of them to a point, I have to call this film out for what it really is:  deja vu.<br /><br />If you've watched films like \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and \\"Pocahontas,\\" you've seen the plot before.  Basically \\"Avatar\\" is exactly like any film that's ever been made that involves one particular species, race, religious group, etc. attempting to invade another group's lands in order to use it for their own gain and one member of the invading party has a change of heart and becomes the victim's champion.<br /><br />The only thing that sets this film apart is the fact that it has brilliant special effects and gorgeous visuals.  With that said, though, the Matt Leblanc clunker \\"Lost In Space\\" also had brilliant special effects and gorgeous visuals as did the three \\"Star Wars\\" prequels.  My point here is that you no matter how pretty a film might look, it doesn't mean that the actual story is worth watching.<br /><br />I believe that Cameron became too caught up in wowing the audience with the film's look and allowed the plot to fall to the wayside.  With each scene in the first two hours of the film, I could almost hear Cameron saying, \\"Look what I can do!\\" as jellyfish-like creatures and tall blue people ran all over the screen.<br /><br />The acting in the film was okay.  I preferred the avatar version of Jake Sully much more than his human counterpart.  Stephen Lang chewed his way through the film as Quaritch. His character reminded me of a number of R. Lee Armey's military performances but was not as fun to watch.  While I liked Zoe Saldana's portrayal of Neytiri, I felt that the animated character actually hindered her overall performance.  Sigourney Weaver stood out from the pack with her portrayal of Augustine.  Another actress who I feel hasn't received enough recognition for her role in this film is Michelle Rodriguez as Trudy Chacon.  In a film full of stock characters, hers was actually fun to watch.<br /><br />I do believe that as time passes and the wow factor wears off, this film will be remembered only for its advances in special effects and not much else.  I do recommend watching it at least once, but that should suffice.  As far as all of the political, environmental, religious aspects that many see in this film, I'll leave those subjects to the indiviual viewers.  The film was a bit preachy as far as environmental activism is concerned in my book and it was also an unfriendly reminder of what was done to the American Indians early in our country's history.  However, I must applaud Cameron for not trying to hide or sugarcoat his own ideals about these subjects.  I just hope he's prepared to defend himself from the numerous attacks that have come his way.ng in the film was okay.

B001993Y2C|4.0|Hi,  Most important issue is the show is true Sci-Fi, not just special effects like Star Trek 2009.  Storyline is fantastic (no giant plot holes like why Spock wouldn't go back in time to save his people from genocide, how cadet Kirk can jump to captain military status, how Nero can have 30 yrs. of advanced technology but refuse to save his world and instead seek revenge - hopefully the next movie will have Spock going back in time to correct the timeline now that new fans are on board so old fans don't refuse to stay on board.  Sorry - I digress)    It's true that box is distasteful and plastic casing should have been present, but the show is great.    Below are \\"pearls\\" that many will find helpful to maximally enjoy the fantastic BG series.    One star lost b/c TEN webisodes omitted from Face of the Enemy as poor decision akin to rotten cardboard boxing.    If the story was not so great, would have deleted another star for lack of subtitles.  Truly deserves only 3 stars, but story just too great to not give 4 stars.    -Season 2, disc 2 ends with \\"Pegasus\\" - don't watch it like I did, b/c disc 3 starts with the extended unaired version.   -Season 3, disc 2 ends with \\"Unfinished Business\\" - don't watch it b/c disc 3 opens with the extended unaired version.   -Season 4, disc 3, the last one - the menu shows 3 'episodes' - 1st- Daybreak part 1, 2nd-Daybreak parts 2&3, and 3rd-Daybreak extended unaired. Maybe I'm a dolt, but it appeared to me the extended unaired covered parts 2&3 - so I watched the broadcast version of part 1, then chose the extended unaired option for 2&3 - WRONG. That option covers ALL 3 PARTS. So I watched the first part all over again, minutes after just completing it.   -Hidden Deleted Scenes (SD, Season 3, Disc 5) ¡V On the 'Colonial Military Assignment Quiz' (fifth disc of Season 3) a hidden deleted scene can be viewed upon completion of the test. It looks like there are seven scenes in total.   - if you hit \\"play all\\" It plays the \\"aired\\" version, then the \\"extended\\" version of the same episode.   - Movies Caprica and the Plan are not included.  - Movie Razor is included.  - Does not have Face of the Enemy webisodes.  The 25 DVDs in this set are the same DVDs available in the 6 season sets (1, 2.0, 2.5, 3, 4.0, 4.5).       - NO SUBTITLES FOR $250 set!!!  How incredibly rude!  - Crummy case can be fixed by buying ultra-slim CD cases for $3 or same price for one padded slide-in CD sheath wallet.  The Supplements: Digging Into the Good Stuff   If you aren't already sitting down as you're reading this review, now would be a good time to pull up a chair.

If you're interested in a serious behind-the-scenes look at the music for the series, you're better off with the ones in the next few discs.

The first time I saw this was on You Tube and it's totally hilarious.   h A Look Back (HD, Disc 3, 37 minutes) ¡V A extensive reminder of the series -- from its production, storylines, characters, and development. This feature is divided into six segments: 'So Say We All,' 'Manifesto Destiny,' 'Battle-Style Galactica,' 'Martyr to a Cause,' 'The Sins of the Forgiven,' and 'Battlestar Revelations.'   h ¡KAnd They Have a Plan (HD, Disc 3, 5 minutes) ¡V A promotional piece for the upcoming 'Battlestar Galactica: The Plan' film.

It's the same one found on the previously released HD DVD.   h U-Control: Battlestar Blips (Season 3, All Discs) ¡V An optional viewing mode with a pop-up trivia and factoid track. This feature is a Season 3 exclusive.   h U-Control: Battlestar Actual (Season 4, All Discs) ¡V When activated, this viewing mode displays a pop-up guide to the terminology used in the show. This feature is a Season 4.0 and 4.5 exclusive.   h U-Control: What the Frak Happened to You? (Season 4.5, Disc 3) ¡V Another picture-in-picture track similar to the one for the miniseries. This one is exclusive to the series finale - 'Daybreak: Extended Version.'   h Are You a Cylon? (HD, Season 1, Disc 4) ¡V Take this interactive quiz to see if you are human or a Cylon.

I've been assigned XO.   h Colonial Military Assignment Quiz (HD, Season 3, Disc 5) ¡V Another interactive quiz to determine what your rank would be in the Colonial fleet. I'm a Lieutenant (that's what I get for being a little rusty on the trivia questions).   h Battlestar Galactica: Ultimate Battle (Season 4.0, Disc 1) ¡V A BD-Live card game. I was expecting a poker-style game like the one from the show, but it's actually more along the lines of a collectible card game. I couldn't get it to work for me, though. The game can be found on the first disc of both 4.0 and 4.5 half-seasons.   h The Musicians Behind Daybreak (SD, Season 4.5, Disc 3, 31 minutes) ¡V In this documentary, composer Bear McCreary gives viewers an inside look at the creation of the music for the series finale.   h Exclusive Deleted Scenes (SD, Season 4.0, Discs 1 & 2, 23 minutes) ¡V Just in case you haven't had enough deleted scenes, there are a few more exclusive to this Blu-ray from the following episodes: 'Six of One,' 'Guess What's Coming to Dinner,' 'The Hub,' and 'Revelations.'   h My Scenes ¡V Bookmark and save clips of favorite scenes and send them to your friends.   h BD-Live Download Center ¡V Lastly, the disc is BD-Live enabled. The area has the usual option to register and a collection of previews, and as of this writing there¡¦s also the Battlestar Galactica: Ultimate Battle card game. I was expecting a poker-style game like the one from the show, but it's actually more along the lines of a collectible card game with Cylons vs. humans. I couldn't get it to work for me, though. The game can be found on the first disc of both 4.0 and 4.5 half-seasons.   The Cutting Room Floor: What Didn't Make the Blu-ray?   While the extensive supplemental package is more than enough to make any 'Battlestar Galactica' fan run circles around the room giddy with glee, there are few items noticeably absent from this Blu-ray collection:  h Battlestar Galactica: The Lowdown (40 minutes) ¡V The featurette originally included on the miniseries DVD release isn't included in this set. However, parts of it have been incorporated into the U-Control features so technically it isn't really a total loss.   h Battlestar Galactica: The Series - The Lowdown (20 minutes) ¡V This \\"making of\\" featurette included on the Season One DVD is also absent, although like the previous featurette, some of this seems to be recycled into the interactive content.   h The Making of Battlestar Galactica: Razor ¡V This behind-the-scenes featurette for the 'Razor' special was included on a bonus disc as a Best Buy exclusive for the DVD release. Too bad that it isn't part of this set.   h 'The Face of the Enemy' Webisodes ¡V A series of ten webisodes 'The Face of the Enemy' is MIA from this set. It's disappointing that Universal couldn't find the room for these segments, but hopefully they will be available at some point perhaps as a download via BD-Live or part of the upcoming movie 'Battlestar Galactica: The Plan.'   Easter Eggs   There are a few Easter eggs reported so far in this set:   h Sharon Audio Quote (Season 2, Disc 5) ¡V On the setup menu, highlight the French option and press RIGHT to hear this audio quote.   h Hidden Deleted Scenes (SD, Season 3, Disc 5) ¡V Technically this might not be considered an egg, but on the 'Colonial Military Assignment Quiz' (fifth disc of Season 3) a hidden deleted scene can be viewed upon completion of the test. It looks like there are seven scenes in total.   h Music Editing Clip (SD, Season 4.5, Disc 1, 2 minutes) ¡V On the setup menu, highlight the \\"Evolution of a Clue\\" option and press RIGHT to access this short featurette.

0316044695|5.0|This book is the most inspiring I have ever read!!! I love to read books, articles, magazines, but this one touched me in way to change part of my outlook. Now when something is hard, whether it be a situation, event, or workout, I say to myself: \\"If a Navy SEAL can do THAT!!! I can certainly do this!!!\\" Such an inspiration. Thank you Officer Luttrell for sharing your story! You and your team have also shown me a greater love and respect for my country and its people. God Bless America.
B00005NTJK|3.0|Benefit - Jethro Tull (3.21 stars)<br />Original Release: 04/20/1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />With You There to Help Me (3 stars)<br />This song has an ominous tone which peaks in an interesting pair of instrumental and vocal choruses.  I'm not able to discern the meaning of the lyrics.  The song has good energy but doesn't interest me as much as I would like it to.<br /><br />Nothing To Say (3 stars)<br />This song first features that distinctive early Tull guitar sound which has a mildly baroque, staccato, hard rock anthem quality to it (for lack of a better description). The lyrics describe a negative mysticism, a wisdom of the rejection of the world.  The guitar peaks with a exuberant melancholy that is evocative when the lyrics reach their brief chorus.<br /><br />Alive and Well and Living In (4 stars)<br />This song brings a slightly more richly textured instrumentation.  The song moves from a bass and piano sectin to a flute and guitar section and back down (in intensity) again. The lyrics describe the unwitnessed choices of a woman who gives without expectation of return.  Very enjoyable song that ends a little soon.<br /><br />Son (3 stars)<br />This song depicts a sarcastic conversation between father and son.  The character of the father is painted with hypocracy.  The song switches tone from hard rock to acoustic guitar in the middle presumably to change the perspective from father to son.  Then it switches back again to complete this short song.  This song and the previous one present some brief character sketches.<br /><br />For Michael Collins, Jeffrey and Me (4 stars)<br />This song starts with a sweet acoustic guitar and lilting vocals.  I don't get the lyrics meaning.  The sweet melancholy picks up a joyful pitch in the chorus.  Interesting, beautiful song.<br /><br />To Cry You a Song (3 stars)<br />That early Tull guitar sound is back and after the chorus the guitar breaks out into a skywards fanfare.  Then the instrumental section descends back down in stages to the vocals again.  The lyrics speak of the travelling musician/singer flying to London to perform (cry = sing); he has his cigarettes and alcohol.<br /><br />A Time for Everything? (3 stars)<br />Piano, guitar, flute start off this song, then, without having realized it there is some of that great aggressive flute playing that until now hasn't been present or noticable anywhere earlier on this album.  The song has a reflective and anticipatory feeling.  I wanted this song to kick off into more aggressive flute playing.  Somehow the song seemed poised to take off but it doesn't quite make it.<br /><br />Inside (3 stars)<br />Lyrics suggest an almost giddy man with nothing in his pockets now but success assured in the near future.  A growing fame already presents privacy issues, perhaps, but the protagonist finds moments to be real with true friends.  The music is also happy and breaks out into a higher joy/faster pace.  A second pass at that higher joy is never made as the remainder of the song seems to stall at the song's initial level of reverie which is somewhat anti-climatic.<br /><br />Play in Time (3 stars)<br />An aggressive flute and guitar again!  Interesting organ work as well.  The lyrics seem to be about performing the music that is within the musician and some of the challenges in doing that.  Interesting \\"edit room\\" effects wind up the energy in places in this song.<br /><br />Sossity; You're a Woman (4 stars)<br />Expose about an older woman who thought she was getting her kicks from a younger man but it seems such relationships only ends in bitter disappointment.  The chorus suggests that this older woman and society are interchangable ideas.  The organ and acoustic guitar make a melancholy joy and the serene chorus is haunting as is the final guitar chord.<br /><br />Singing All Day (2 stars)<br />Straight-forward song about the happy anticipation of seeing a particular woman; short dreamy mid-section adds only slight interest to this song.<br /><br />Witch's Promise (4 stars)<br />Acoustic guitar and flute instrument this anima song.  The mood picks up a notch and mellotrons come in.  The song builds as it goes forward  more effectively than most of Tull's songs to date that I have reviewed.<br /><br />Just Trying to Be (3 stars)<br />A xylophone or well tuned toy piano and acoustic guitar play on this quiet and extremely short song with evocative lyrics about how personal identity is confused by parental over-guiding of the play of their children.<br /><br />Teacher [Original UK Mix] (3 stars)<br />Funky version of that early Tull guitar sound.  The lyrics describe a \\"teacher\\" who recommends not getting stuck in things and getting out and experiencing the world while the listener humorously seems to miss the point.  But this whole exchange seems to occur in the bright morning of a day inside the protagonist's head; a waking dream of inspiration soon lost.<br /><br />Album:<br /><br />That familiar guitar sound heard on some of Tull's most popular classic rock songs appears on this album for the first time.  The album is a collection of songs with some more musically interesting that others.  I wouldn't quite call them a progressive rock band at this point although they are widely appreciated by fans of the genre; Tull's songs are not slaves to the standard chorus, but they have only a few, well-developed instrumental sections.  Still something seems to be developing in their songs making them a tad more interesting with each album.<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Four stars (4 stars)<br />1.

1416572287|5.0|My 11 year old son is nuts about physics, so I got this book to see how it would go over with him.   It did, perfectly.  The whole ruse of explaining physics to a dog was hilarious to him and really made concrete some of the things that the author was trying to explain.  I had my son explaining to me, laughing, how a dog could walk through a tree if he went slowly enough (with all the physics behind that crazy statement) and then hilariously illustrating what would happen if the dog didn't go quite slow enough.  (He'd bonk his head).  You'd think he was recounting a Calvin and Hobbes joke.    The entire time my son was reading this he kept coming to me with, \\"did you know...\\" and \\"wow!  I never realized that\\" epiphanies.   He did say that some of the stuff being explained was really hard, although he jumped to the author's defense saying that he thinks it's not that he did a bad job explaining it, it's just that some of it was, well, tough.    I am very pleased with this book and am so glad I selected it for my son.  It seems to be a great choice for an intelligent person without much real physics background who wants to learn about the material.

B000HIVOI2|1.0|Waste of money for the blue ray version, Will never by anything with lions gate on it again
B002XTBEDI|3.0|This DVD is two more episodes which continue the original five episode series.  If you haven't watched the first series of episodes, or if you are unfamiliar with the Elizabeth Gaskell novel \\"Cranford\\", you will have a difficult time if you begin this series here.  It is assumed by the film makers that the viewer will be familiar with the characters and location and there is no attempt made to explain who characters are or their background or relationships to one another.<br /><br />From a purely artistic standpoint I would not hesitate to rate these two episodes as 4 stars.  The attention to period details in location, props, costumes and make up are superb.  I also think that the acting was of a very high quality.<br /><br />When it comes to the actual plot of the episodes I'm afraid my rating drops to 2 stars.  This series has evolved into a type of soap opera done in period costume.  All appearances of adhering to the style of characters and situations developed by Elizabeth Gaskell have been abandoned in favor of \\"modern\\" danger and drama.  The whole charm of the characters of Gaskell's \\"Cranford\\" is that they are so understated and yet survive so well within their own small sphere of life.  In order to lengthen this series, completely new ideas have been developed and characters have been added or have disappeared completely at the whim of the writing team.  I really do think that the \\"cranford\\" style could have been kept, but it would have necessitated an entirely different type of program.  There are characters who have been made to act completely opposite to how they were originally drawn and some have been modernized to such an extent that I no longer recognize them.  I'm sorry about that.  I am also exceedingly sorry about what was decided to happen with the train wreck.  Surely, surely another idea could have been used for causing that wreck.  As long as you are making the whole thing up from whole cloth now anyway, why not make a better choice in that instance?<br /><br />I've chosen to assign a 3 star rating to these episodes, but I don't think I will encourage my friends to buy this set.

0756405890|5.0|I don't quite know what to say about this book or how to describe it. That I liked it, that i thought it was awesome, even amazing. Such thoughts seems like such a generic review and I want my reviews to have a bit more... well character.      On that note the depth of this books characters and story is amazing and every bit of depth helps. Even passing characters are given a bit more of a depth, that is often lacking in most authors books. Whether its a kind old cobbler giving away a pair of shoes to the main character Kvothe or a pawn broker the Kvothe sells one of his most prized possessions to, the characters are given depth. The depth given to them helps to submerse the reader and add sense of realism into the world and life of Kvothe.     The other thing I found very unique and enjoyable in this book is the story within the story aspect. We have the story of the current time Kvothe, an inn keeper who is a mix between a mysterious retired hero, depressed and at others times upbeat and charming. And then there is the story of  the Kvothe of his youth that he and the reader relive as the innkeeper recounts his past to a scribe.   Its almost two stories in one with two very different main characters that are the same person. Confusing? Though it may sound a bit confusing its not.    It should be noted that this book does start a bit slow, the good part doesn't start until the start of chapter 8. However I believe this is necessary for the two different time period aspect of the story I mentioned above. In the two sequels to this book I can only hope the lead in is much faster paced.    I highly recommend this book to anyone and also recommend that you not judge this book based on any synopsis you my find on it. Instead I would recommend you judge it on the ratings and  then the next time you have time to spare, go to the book store, find this book, buy it, go home, sit down and read.    Can't wait for the next two, keep them coming Pat....    -Alex
0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief is unarguably a well-written, compelling story addressing life during the war by following the common daily struggles of the people of Himmel Street.  It is a difficult task for a writer to not overwhelm a reader with so much death and tragic subject matter, but Zusak does it stunningly and with a honesty that forges a unique depth in each character.  I think this is a superb young adult book that communicates the time period through well-crafted characters and provides a tiny peak into the hardships faced by all German citizens during the war.  Although the families were not Jews, the humanity and sympathy they felt for what was occurring in the country mixed with their own powerlessness and fear to stop what was happening is honorably depicted and gives an important insight into the complexity of humanity.<br /><br />This is a personal opinion, but I was not a fan of `Death' as the narrator.  Particularly, I did not like the excerpt of commentary throughout the book.  I found it distracting, intrusive and interruptive to the flow.  The story is to be told from Death's perspective but wavers often to Liesel's, the Book Thief's, perspective.  A duel attempt is made to give a different, but similar perspective of humanity, but I'm not sure it heightened or was necessary to include.  I'm also not a big fan of epilogues in any book, and specifically was annoyed with the use of this technique in the Book Thief.  It was powerful enough to stand alone without the after thoughts.  I felt by doing so, it distracted from the imagery that built towards the `end.'
B0016O95IW|5.0|great cd, if you're a fan of theory of a deadman, you will like this cd. I don't think there is one bad song, but thats my opinion.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I had forgotten how talented and prolific Lennon and Mcartney were.  It is astounding how many great tunes these guys wrote, and how well they performed them.  I love the re-mastering.  I listen to them on my 5.1 system in the car and the separation is fabulous.  Best music purchase ever!!!
0439023491|3.0|Lately I have become concerned about the spread of dystopian fiction...a mainstay of academic and mannered science fiction writing for a decade...into the young adult fiction market.<br /><br />As did the first book of the Hunger Games series, Catching Fire tries to balance the concepts of hope and liberation with the overpowering ennui-generating dystopian milieu. In other words I was really fighting boredom with this book, and every so often it would pick me up and shake me...and I finished it.<br /><br />What I don't understand is why authors of young adult fiction write such depressing books. When I was a kid, there was enough depressing stuff going on in the world that the last thing I wanted to do was to read a depressing book.<br /><br />It is almost as though depressing equals good. And I don't believe that.<br /><br />Three stars for this book.<br /><br />Walt Boyes
0394826817|5.0|Who can resist the adorable illustrations? Besides, the message in this book sinks in.  I found out when my 5 year-old son paused as we were leaving a children's party, shook hands with the hostess, and said, \\"Thank you for a very nice time.\\"  A direct quote from Lowly worm, I think.      We even recommend this book on our \\"manners for mothers\\" blog.
B0009P42S2|5.0|Steamboy is one of the best Anime movies I've ever seen. The art work itself is enough to recommend this excellent title but then the creators had to go and add such an awesome story as well. the landscapes in this movie are made with such detail you can see every building in all its glory. This story connects to our history so well that you can believe that everything in it actually plausible. Yet not only the story and art make this a must have, each character brings out a whole different perspective adding to the power with which you feel through the art.     Item came on time in perfect condition, I plan to get my use out of this dvd over and over.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Overall, this video does its job. I felt like I had a workout. Beginners shouldn't shy away from this video. Yes the first couple times it is really difficult, but doable. More advanced people,I think this could still work for you too.    Personally, I don't do well with doing the same thing over and over, so doing the same video for 30 days isn't for me. For me, I switch up videos, doing this video four times a week.

0307266303|3.0|If you are a dedicated recreational long distance runner, your will likely give this book a five star rating after reading it.  If you aren't, it's hard to tell what your reaction might be.      The book is about ultramarathoning, the Tarahumara Indian tribe whose members are known for their ability to run exceptionally long distances, and a race involving several top ultramatrathoners and the best of the Tarahumara runners.  Inserted are two diverting chapters that extol the virtues of barefoot running and hypothesize that human evolution is due to the ability of early man to run long distances.  Though interesting, I found the placement of these chapters broke the flow of the story, particularly the chapter relating to man's evolution which is the longest chapter in the book.    Clearly, the strength of the book is the story.  McDougall tells a good story.  His characters are unusual to say the least.  McDougall writes in a breezy style.  In reading the book, I felt as if I were in a bar with a group of serious runners and a story teller each of who were working on a third or fourth beer.  I'm sure McDougall enhances the truth of what really happened, but don't hold that against him.  It's the story that counts.    I had problems with the two diverting chapters.  Chapter 25 extols the virtues of running barefoot.  I found a logical problem in McDougall's reasoning.  On the one hand, he argues that running shoes inhibit the foot from exercising in a natural way, preventing it from being as strong as in might be.  If you put a joint in a cast for three weeks, for example, once the cast is off you will have a much weaker joint.  On the other hand, McDougall argues that there is so much kinetic energy in a foot strike while running that a running shoe is helpless to cushion and control as the shoe makers advertise.  These arguments are contradictory.  Personally, I buy the kinetic energy argument and agree that the best buy in a running shoe is usually the cheapest shoe.  I had other problems with that chapter, but will only say that even McDougall's ideal runners, the Tarahumara, don't run barefooted.    Chapter 28 is essentially an exposition of an evolutionary biologist's notion that a key (the key?) factor in man's evolution was his ability to run long distances, specifically to run after prey until the prey was exhausted and could run no longer.  I did not buy this argument at all.  My thinking assumed that man could hunt this way and that let's say man has chased the prey down and killed it.  Now what happens?  There is the issue of transporting the prey back to the village.  Or if the prey is butchered right there, the hunter(s) has to carry his butchering tools on the run, or make them at the killing site.  All of this will take a long time.  It just seems very inefficient to me.  A much more efficient way to hunt is to trap, domesticate animals to help, or hunt by lying in wait for the prey to come.  If this chapter were more like 10 pages long rather than 31, I wouldn't have objected so much.  But after reading about 15 pages of the chapter, I had great difficulty in finishing it.  There are just way too many other explanations to account for man's evolution for me to put any credence in this one.

B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Soon after starting the movie, I came to the conclusion that this was geared more toward adults than children.  There were several serious momemts which out weighed the few funny ones.  Ed Asner was great as the old man, you couldn't help but feel all the same emotions as the old man did.  Really liked the scenes with the bird and dog, these parts help to lighten up the mood of the film.  Wish I could write more but don't want to give away what happens in the movie.  Overall, this was a great film, it made you look back on your own life and dreams yet unfulfilled.
B000274THQ|5.0|\\"Good bye, Lenin\\" is a German movie about a family in East Germany. After the Wall has fallen the western culture came to East Germany - like Coca Cola, modern cars and modern fashion. As his mother has been in a coma while the Wall fell, Alex tries everything to make his mother believe that her beloved East Germany as she knew it has never disappeared. A very funny story - you MUST see it :-)
B002K0WBYG|4.0|I bought the Blu-ray version of The proposal for my wife  for Christmas and after watching the film, we decided it  could've been done better.  The alternate ending would've made the film better. The film drags  along during the middle and the ending wasn't very satisfying.
B00005JKGK|5.0|This is a great movie, I put this in the same catagory as The Color Purple and Crash, which I also recommend.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I gave this product a five, because the film is fantastic and Amazon hasn't figured out how to separate the various mediums of a single movie version yet, but THE QUALITY OF THE BLU-RAY DISC IS HORRIBLE. This is one of my all-time favorite films, but I quickly traded it in, despite having already sold off my DVD copy (which was of better quality), because it looked that bad...and I'm not particularly picky! How can studios be allowed to rip off the public like this? \\"Here's your nifty new Blu-Ray version of your favorite movie! Oh wait, did we forget to tell you that we made the transfer from an old VCR tape we had laying around? Sorry, but you can't return it, because you've already opened it.\\" I'd love to see some class action suits filed for this and other movies I've heard similar reviews of, because this is seriously defrauding the public.    In regard to the film itself, the costumes, sets, storyline and music are all top notch, despite a miniscule budget. The movie follows fairly closely to the novel and those changes that are made, due justice to the story, in my opinion. Most of the acting is good, if not great, the exceptions being typically-dull Keanu and Oldman's best performance to date, in my opinion. That this film got so little Academy consideration in a week Oscar year has always befuddled me. If you like the book, horror movies or Gary Oldman, don't miss this one.
0061537969|5.0|\\"The Art of Racing In The Rain\\" by Garth Stein<br /><br />It's rare that a book touches me so that I hardly know whether to blather on or just say `read it.'  This book is one of the most original and creative works of fiction I've ever read.  I can't tell you too much without spoiling it.<br /><br />I've always wanted to know what goes on in the minds of dogs because I think they are much purer of spirit than humans.  This book is told from the viewpoint of a dog, and it illuminates both the character and soul of a dog while actually exposing the foibles and failings of human beings, and their greatness.  It is a compendium of life lessons based on analogies to the art of racing in the rain.<br /><br />Enzo sees himself as a man in a dog suit, straining against his flat unsuitable-for-speech tongue and his severed dew claws, which he believes are the genetic roots of opposable thumbs and clear proof of his belief that when his dog life is over he will resume as a man. He watches TV, loves watching race videos, and loves riding shotgun while his master, Dennis, takes him on trial runs at the track.<br /><br />Dennis is an aspiring race car driver. A race car driver who successfully learns the art of racing in the rain has a deft touch--not too hard and not too soft.  You become one with the car, and the tires become one with the road, and the road becomes one with the rain.  \\"When something unpredictable happens, you have to react to it; if you react at speed, you're too late.  And so you should be afraid.\\"<br /><br />\\"Your car goes where your eyes go.\\" \\"Such a simple concept, yet so true: that which we manifest is before us; we are creators of our own destiny.\\"  Life lessons.<br /><br />\\"I was not above using the tools of my dogness to exact justice.\\"  I was in a state of total relaxation as I heard that line from the audio version of \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" that I was listening to, but my relaxation was magically transformed to laughter and glee at how Enzo delivered justice to his evil tormenters.<br /><br />Read the book.  I think you will burst out laughing too.  Which is good, because there are moments of love, grief, sadness, joy, and injustice that characterize the human world because humans are not as good as dogs..      Read the book.  I think you will burst out laughing too.  Which is good, because there are moments of love, grief, sadness, joy, and injustice that characterize the human world because humans are not as good as dogs.

0307455874|5.0|This book is excellent, Barack Obama has a very clear concept of a democracy that is for the good of all people. He does not have a private agenda, he is honest and fair in his plans and thus far has lived up to his ideals whenever our government supports him. He wrote this book before he became a presidential candidate.
B001U0D77C|4.0|Great movie, although you have to pay attention to details, its really fun for those who want suspense.
1423119509|5.0|I bought this set for my 11-year old son for Christmas, but my husband and 15-year old daughter took them over right away and read them first.  My son prefers this series to Harry Potter at this point.  The treasure chest-looking box makes a nice package.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|I have this on VHS, and have basically played it out.  The movie is very funny to me, especially Dr. Strangelove. The character names are absolutely hilarious, like General Jack D. Ripper, General Buck Turgidson,  Colonel 'Bat' Guano.  One of my favorite quotes is by  President Merkin Muffley: \\"Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!\\"
B00004X10B|5.0|All I have to say is this bag is big...REALLY big. Think big then think bigger. I actually haven't even loaded my gear into it because it's just that big. I put in a Canon flash, 50D, 24-135, 50mm, XSi, 18-55mm and seriously wasn't even enough to fill up half of this bag...let alone the many pockets.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|For common fans of Will Ferrell, I could easily see how this movie would fall vastly short of their expectations.  However, make no mistake...this is arguably his best movie, as he shows some decent range and emotion in a well written and portrayed script.  As a man who awakes to find that he is a character in his own story and relegated to the role of puppet for his narrator, he has ample opportunity to display his comedic talents while branching into territory that would warrant him some acting praise beyond that of his typical cookie-cutter slapstick comedies.  I must admit, I am not one who closely follows the latest of his Anchorman sequels (that of course being Talladega Nights, Step Brothers, Blades of Glory, etc.)...as I said earlier, his comedies usually follow that same strain of comedy.  However, this clear detachment from his status quo warrants some close attention of any that would enjoy a good movie which blends themes of comedy, love, drama, and self discovery.  This movie is a perfect example of the fact that comedies can carry some wit and depth and still make for not only a good comedy, but a good movie in general!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this dvd as a christmas gift for my husband.  He loves it. Can't wait for more from Susan Boyle.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this show, it is excellent quality people have been saying that the movement's of peoples mouths is off with the sound but it only happens on a hand full of the shows and its only happens for about 2-5 seconds its not major enough to give the DVDs a 1 star rating, some of the episodes are out of order though I started noticing it when Matthew's hair would be short then long every other episode and then I really noticed it when they changed the Colleen character and then all the sudden the old Colleen reappeared but I have no issues with the series or DVDs I love them and I got them at a great discount I'm very satisfied!
B00288KNJU|5.0|Excellent product (movie); fair price. 3D glasses weak, should be plastic; but in general terms liked by kids.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|This is just a review of the Blu-Ray \\"2 Disc Special Edition\\" since there are plenty of reviews of the movie itself by reviewers far more qualified than I.    The video and sound quality is excellent and I have no complaints about that. But I have to give this 4 stars instead of 5, because, I just don't get some of the \\"marketing lingo\\" on this package:    * This version does NOT include a running commentary. None at all (not director, not actors, not cinematographer, nothing). To me this is really odd -- it seems that almost all DVDs released in the last 10 years have had some sort of commentary track. Especially with a Tarantino movie, this seems like something you really WANT to have.  * I think this is the only Blu-ray version available right now. It includes the \\"digital copy\\" but that is just a lower-res copy of a movie with DRM, nothing wrong with getting that with it, but that is one of the TWO discs in the \\"Special Edition\\"  * If this is the only one available, and it doesn't include stuff like a commentary, what makes the Marketing people put the \\"Special Edition\\" tag on it? I guess because it comes with the low-res copy, see previous item...  * Other info on the package is misleading too. It says under \\"Additional Features:\\" \\"The original Inglorious Bastards.\\" This might lead one to conclude that it includes the original movie (and there would be plenty of room for an SD copy of a movie on a Blu-ray disk. This feature is just a 10-minute summary of the movie and discusses it's relation to the new movie. A nice feature worth watching, but I think the way it is named as a feature is misleading.  * Minor thing: They put a sticker about \\"Includes Digital Copy\\" on the metallic-printed cardboard sleeve. When you take off the sticker, it removes part of the metallic printing. I know these sleeves are only meant to make the product look nice and flashy and get your attention when it's on a store shelf. But for those of us that like to keep these, it was annoyingthe way it was stickered. If they put the sticker on the outer plastic shrink-wrap this wouldn't be a problem.    Still a great movie and I'm glad I got the disc. Giving it 4 of 5 because of the questionable \\"Special-ness\\" of the Edition.
0786886811|3.0|I bought this book and i was quite pleased with it-until i tried to cook from it!  I love the way Nigella writes about food and her approach but ive found some of the measurements to maybe be slightly off? I tried the PB bites and i had to throw them away as they were so disgusting,it was basically like eating pure butter...not enough peanut butter and tooo much butter.   The only thing i tried that turned out a success were the pepper cookies for hanging on the tree at christmas!   I made them in the evening and set them to cool and by the time id gone back to ice them half had been eaten by various family memebers.  They were really nice...id never had pepper in a cookie before but they were delish.  Overall its a great book, but there are not alot of recipes that gave me that umpf feeling of wanting to cook it. I'd still say buy it as its a great read and its fun to dip in and out of now and again.
B002WPVNOS|4.0|It's a nice album, and it's a great departure from Dreaming Out Loud. However, there were about two or three tracks that I could not listen to again (notably Lullaby, it's too slow even for a ballad). On the flip side, I DO believe All the Right Moves is overrated a tad, and Secrets should be the next single. It's a great orchestrated piece of work, with the strings bringing in much effect. For 5 dollars, it's a steal, at 8 dollars for full price it's worth a listen.    Key Tracks:  All the Right Moves  Marchin' On  Secrets  Good Life
1400153786|2.0|I am referring, in particular to Chapter 4, entitled \\"WHY THERE CERTAINLY IS NO GOD\\".  Previously in Chapter 2 he dissed agnostics, so Dawkins really thinks atheism is the only sensible belief.  When you read Chapter 4, you see it is mostly a refutation the argument from design and certainly not a mathematical (probabilistic) proof of God's non existence as you might be lead to believe from the title.  If I define God as a Creator who wasn't created Himself, what can you disprove?  Dawkins just finds that idea ridiculous and leaves it at that.    My basic beef with the book is that it doesn't hone in on the obnoxious and dangerous part of religion and wastes lots of words attacking stuff non religious people, like myself, can live with in others.  The threat to civilization, in an age of weapons of mass destruction, is the belief that supernatural beings have told a small number of prophets how humankind should behave and those prophets have told the rest of us, so we better follow what they said.  In contrast to the existence of God, all accounts of God to man communication are very easy to refute.  Nobody has explained why an almighty should only tell a few.  If the supernatural agents were both all powerful (so be better obey them) and benevolent (so we will be better people if we obey them) then those agents would have told enough people that there would be no doubt as to what they want.      Dawkins never gets into the above argument.  He is too busy skewering people who enjoy a belief in the supernatural, even though most of those people don't have any intention of forcing their faith, in any way, on others.

0393057658|5.0|In the early 1990s Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland A's, combined Bill James statistical data for baseball junkies, hired Harvard graduates and brought the power of technology to baseball.<br /><br />Neccessity is the mother to invention.  The Oakland A's ownership did not have the money to compete for players in a league with no salary caps. And he figured out a way to build a competitive baseball team using statistical analysis.<br /><br />Up to that point, baseball relied on having 100s of scouts watch players and rate them numerically with KPI's like hitting, hitting for power, speed, arm stregth and fielding ability.  The rating's input was only as good as the amount of times the scout saw the the High School or College player.  And the ratings were subjective, unique to each scout, so there was no way to compare ALL scouted players.  Scouting main objective was to provide a GM input in the amateur draft.<br /><br />Beene did not have the money to employ enough scouts to cover the country.  So he decided to only draft college players as opposed to HS players because the former had a rich and accurate database of statistics.<br /><br />It is more complicated than this - but Beene believed that the most important hitting skill was \\"on base percentage\\".  So he drafted players in each round based on this object number<br /><br />He went on to use Harvard graduates to refine the objective number. One iteresting refinement was actually divided each ball park into a gride using thousands and thousands of rows and columns. By doing this he deducted hits that an average fielder should have made an out and added hits that an exeptional fielder denied a hit.<br /><br />His concepts now are widely used. So much in fact that the \\"playing field\\" has been leveled and the richer teams now again have the advantage.<br /><br />Michael Lewis is a great writer.  His other books have all been successful. The latest of which was called \\"Blind Side\\" that was made into a movie and Sandra Bullock just one a Golden Globe for here performance in the movie.ce in the movie.
B000I2J6K0|4.0|I ordered this dvd because I was looking for some variety in my prenatal workouts. I am 4 months pregnant with my second child and currently do the elliptical machine and yoga a few times a week. I am a very fit person who has worked out regularly since I was a teenager. I can't always get to the gym so I wanted a dvd that would give me a little cardio boost as well as work muscles that I'm not currently working on the elliptical. This video is a very good solution. The cardio section isn't as long as I hoped it would be but maybe I'll be grateful for that a few months from now! The muscle toning section is surprisingly good, making my inner thighs and lats sore the next morning. Overall, this video is quite similar to the old Jane Fonda videos.    I agree with the other reviews that the video quality is not good but I could care less if it means I'm going to get a decent workout.
B001AVCFJM|4.0|The most common review I've read of this movie is that is \\"a good movie, but against Star Trek canon\\".  I'm not a real trekkie, never been to a conference, never asked Shatner for his autograph, but I do own the movies and enjoy watching it on TV.  I don't think this movie is good to the general public and bad to ST fans, but good to the general public and ESPECIALLY good for ST fans.  The common objection is that it is in violation of ST canon.  However, virtually the whole movie occurs in an alternate reality, and alternate realities are commonplace in the ST universe.  While it does differ from what ST fans know, the fact is that this universe is altered with the appearance of the rogue Romulan vessel in the past, which allows different development for the characters.  While the TOS (The Original Series) characters take different storylines, the writers and actors do an outstanding job of maintaining the personalities of these characters.  Also, the film is full of nuances only ST fans will comprehend.  The best example, in my opinion, is when young Kirk meets future Spock in a cave on the ice planet, and Spock introduces himself with the phrase, \\"I am, and always shall be, your friend\\".  Non-ST fans will probably construe this as a general statement of non-hostility between unknown parties.  ST fans will feel momentarily gut-kicked by this reference.    The film is not wholly bereft of issues, particularly temporal cyclical issues.  If Vulcan truly was destroyed, how would it affect the ST universe?  In particular, since Spock was reborn on Vulcan in Star Trek III, wouldn't this movie preclude itself from happening? More important, how would many of these issues translate to the real world.  Replace Starfleet with the U.S. Navy.  Would an Annapolis cadet be promoted to the Captain of the flagship, even if he did do a good job on one mission?  Of course not.    The best way to enjoy this movie is simply watch it, cast aside any obvious disbelief, and if you're aStar Trek fan, enjoy the subtle nuances your friends don't pick up.
0440238153|4.0|I have already watched the movie The Golden Compass. I also read the first two books the Golden Compass, and The Subtle Knife. I thought the amber spyglass would have a different plot other then following along with the Subtle Knife book two. I felt sorry for the two kids that grew up together and then could not live together and watch each other grow old. I was glad to find a papper back copy for only 0.01 cents plus shipping charges 3.99. I did feel that I got my monies worth out of the book. I would not have liked to pay $7.00 for a new book. I did not feel that the book deserved such a price. I thought the 4.00 I paid a good price for such a disappointing read.

She is a young girl in Nazi Germany, sent to live with foster parents. The book is split into ten parts, each one titled after a book that had a major impact on her life. The story goes through several years of Liesel's life through World War II, interjected by the three times that Death saw her. The first was when her brother died and she stole her first book, the second when a plane crashes down, and third when Liesel's world comes crashing down. Liesel goes through her life, playing soccer and stealing books, her love of words and books connecting her to others, from her foster father to the Jewish man they are hiding in their basement.     The writing style of this book is something that one cannot easily forget. Zusak uses vivid imagery and sharp details to pull the readers into the story. His characters are dynamic and almost familiar, making you feel as if you have known them forever. The book is something that cannot be easily forgotten, its message of the capacity for words to touch the soul. This is technically a Young Adult book, but I think it caters just as well to adults. It's unfortunate that it has been labeled as Young Adult, because a lot of people will pass on reading it, and they are missing out.     Some people say that this is no one \\"amazing\\" book that can touch your heart in such a way that changes how you look at the world. I disagree. This book can absolutely do that. This book will make you laugh, make you cry, and it will touch your heart.

B001W63DXC|5.0|Yes, I am a fan of Maiden....UP THE IRONS!!! But this DVD is more than just another concert DVD. Its a documentary and behind the scenes look of a band that just makes great rock n roll, and what life is like behind the scenes. From going to countries who never get to see them like India and Chile, to a show in Los Angeles where Rock n Roll loyalty come to see them play and put on one of the greatest live shows ever! Very touching moment of the fan in Chile who is overcome with emotion after the show ends while holding one of Nicko's drumsticks. Its little gems like this throughout the movie that make it great. And you can't help but sing along with Eric Idle singing \\"Always Look at the Bright Side of Life\\" at the end. Brilliant! And the concert DVD rocks too. My favorite, Rime of the Ancient Mariner (I was there).
B0015HOFZI|1.0|This unit took 3 classic piano music pieces (songs) from an LP and turned them into 30 \\"wav\\" files on my hard drive.  The graphical user interface has you name the pieces (per the LP's list) and it named the first 3 fragments with those 3 names - and did not name the other 27.  Those 3 fragments (and 17 others) used to be part of the first piece.  I used the software tutorial and the \\"help\\" menu to no avail.  Then I contacted Sony twice but they did not respond to my requests for assistance.  I returned the item to Amazon.com for a full refund.      The fragments are useless if your intention was to enjoy a digitally preserved copy of your LP - how do you play a particular song?  Do you tell Windows Media Player that those 20 fragments were all the same piece so they should be played back in rapid succession?  There is a method in Sony's software to merge \\"wav\\" files back together but (1) try to do this with an ear for a professional piano solo and (2) I can't imagine even wanting to do this 30 times for each side of an LP in a collection of over 100 classic music LPs.  The math is daunting:  30 fragments per side * 100 LPs * 2 sides per LP = 6,000 fragments.    Should anyone be curious, the LP was \\"Michele Campanella, Piano - Liszt Complete Hungarian Rhapsodies\\" and the three pieces were \\"No. 1 in C Sharp Minor\\", \\"No. 2 in C Sharp Minor\\", and \\"No. 3 in B Flat\\".
B001FBSMF8|4.0|Chris Cornell has had a rather storied and successful career. He broke out during the \\"grunge\\" alternative rock era with the band Soundgarden. He had a side project entitled Temple of the Dog, which captured the true heart and soul of that era. He embarked on a solo career after Soundgarden broke up in 1997, and then returned to the band scene with Audioslave in 2001 launching yet another string of successful albums. After parting ways with the Rage Against The Machine clan that primarily made up Audioslave in 2007, Cornell carried on with his solo career and in 2008 released an appropriately titled album Carry On; it was a fine return to his solo work after his first brilliant solo outing Euphoria Morning in 1999. Then in 2009, he released Scream. To say the least it was a dramatic departure from his twenty plus year career as a rock icon. From the outset, take a look at his newest album cover pictured above where he smashes the guitar...that should tell you what's going on here. He is making the transition from Rock God to Pop Sensation.<br /><br />  For many hardcore fans, Scream may be a disappointment. Though, I consider myself a hardcore fan of his and I have always been marveled by his range as an artist. He can grind the heaviest rock better than anyone as he did in his early years of Soundgarden and throughout his tenure in Audioslave, or sing the sweetest and soulful of ballads in his solo work. He has incredible vocal range as well as songwriting range too, just take a listen at the song \\"Say Hello 2 Heaven\\" on Temple of the Dog. Anyway, back to Scream, it will certainly shock you from the very first track entitled \\"Part of Me.\\" I remember when I first popped this CD into my stereo and I remember saying out loud, \\"Wow!\\" It was a surprised \\"wow\\" rather than an impressed exclaim. However, I was won over very quickly because this is Chris Cornell doing essentially what he has always done - he has always tried to do different things in the music world. He has always consistently reinvented his sound with each passing album in one particular way or another. It is an impressive feat for any artist, and Cornell has done it with such success...<br /><br />[...]ys consistently reinvented his sound with each passing album in one particular way or another.

B000068FXR|5.0|This is a much overlooked album. It was created under pressure and has been called \\"unpolished\\" as many expect of Supertramp's studio projects. I feel it's one of the best representation of their true talents. \\"Crisis\\" and \\"Crime\\" are IMO their best, followed by \\"Even in the Quietest Moments\\". Their later albums may have hit the pop charts but aren't their best.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Muse is rapidly becoming one of the more popular bands in America today, and with good reason. The Resistance is a rock album like no other made in today's modern age. What the band does so wonderfully is that it transcends rock n roll more so than its contemporaries. It has the ability to fuse together the orchestral sounds of classical music with the aggressiveness of modern rock. Muse is also very keen on creating some truly beautiful melodic moments as well. It's this versatility that makes Muse a unique musical act, and a rather complete one as well. Matthew Bellamy, the bands lead singer, songwriter and pianist, is the heart of the group, and his talents, along with the rest of the band, really make their new effort, The Resistance, one of 2009's best overall records.<br /><br />  The group of songs on The Resistance seem like they have all been carefully assembled and arranged with great care. Each song, in its own respect, has something to offer in one way or another. The opening three tracks (\\"Uprising\\", \\"Resistance\\", and \\"Undisclosed Desires\\") are indeed the best in my opinion, and really showcase Muse's diverse talents. The rest of the album has many high points as well. \\"United States of Eurasia (+Collateral Damage)\\" is a decent song, but ends on a interesting note with Matthew Bellamy playing his own arrangement of a Chopin classical piano piece. And while there are many other strong songs here on the album, attention must be paid to the epic finale - \\"Exogenesis.\\" It is a three part song, encompassing the final quarter of the album, and is a modern masterpiece. It is essentially a classical-rock piece, that blends both genres together, creating a euphoric sound unlike anything I've heard in quite some time. All three parts of \\"Exogenesis\\" are beautiful, but perhaps the best is the middle section entitled \\"Exogenesis: Symphony Pt. 2, Cross-Pollination.\\"...<br /><br />[...]
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Mastodon's Crack the Skye is absolutely startling.  The first few times through, I wasn't sure what exactly I was listening to or if I even liked it as a whole, in spite of the initial bright spots.  Then this bad boy really started to take a hold of me.  This music is HUGE.  It is what Mothra has on his iPod while soaring over the countryside and then flaming unsupecting villages into, well, oblivion.  Over time, I have developed a kind of relationship with this music.  Initially, I just saw or heard what was just on the surface, and in retrospect, I think that my brain had to get used to the easy stuff, before it could process the thrilling, jaw dropping, density that was there all the time. Now when I listen, new surprises pop up all the time in familiar places, kind of like seeing your roomate suddenly juggle 5 balls at one time, and songs that may have once seemed long are over before I want them to be.  Now I crave it if it has been a few days.  The thing about Mastodon is that what they can do collectivly as a band is much greater than the sum of 4 guys fondling their instruments of choice, and when you listen to it and GET IT, you end up feeling larger yourself.  Sure I want other people to enjoy this music the visceral way that I do and I really hope they do, but if they don't, it doesn't matter, because me having it is more than enough.
0810993139|3.0|This is one of those \\"yeah, I guess it was okay\\" books.     The main character, a socially ostracized middle-schooler named Greg, journals his day to day ado throughout the course of one school year. His life is full of the typical trials and tribulations of most adolescents, from being too physically inept to be a champion wrestler, to getting bullied by the older kids on Halloween night. Along the way, his trusted (and only) companion, Rowley -- an even more unpopular student --, sticks by Greg's side, and is often getting bullied right along side Greg (or by Greg himself).    The intended audience of this book (or series) does not quite make itself evident, so I am uncertain as to whom the author is writing. My sense is this book has two audiences: adults or young adults who have fond (read: horrific) memories of middle school, thus being able to relate to the material; and grade school-aged kids who find humor in more of the juvenile scenarios and pedestrian jokes.     Crude illustrations abound give this \\"diary\\" a comic strip-type feel, but oddly add very little to the book's overall humor -- of which there was very little anyway.     A quick read if you're looking to kill an hour at the library, but do not go out of your way to purchase it.
B00005JN2Z|2.0|Found myself wanting to turn it off before the ending. And saying to myself, boring. If a movie is based in reality,  I find it very hard to concentrate on the movie when presented with a string of non-sensical events. Basically, it  had it's moments, but mostly felt like a waste of my time. Just watched it for the first time last night.
B002VECM3Q|5.0|When I saw the previews I knew there was something great about this movie. Ninja Assassin takes the best of the ninja action from anime classics, such as Ninja Scroll, and brings them to life. What makes this movie better than most is not the hand to hand fighting, but the weapons and intense training employed by ninjas. Normally where in most movies with ninjas you would see a couple of shurikens thrown here and there, NOT HERE, that is where the fun comes in. It's feasible dozens are thrown over time like a storm and they come out of nowhere, it seems. There are a lot of things that set this movie apart from many others and it is definitely worth seeing.

0786838655|5.0|Once upon a time, I used to love reading the myths detailing the adventures of the Greek and Roman gods and goddesses, and the exploits of heroes like Perseus and Theseus. Rick Riordan takes a unique approach to the old stories by updating the legends and placing them squarely in 21st-century America with his Percy Jackson & the Olympians series. The new Olympus (found by taking the elevator to the 600th floor of the Empire State Building, no less) relocated to America because the gods and goddesses, birthed in ancient Greece, the \\"cradle of Western Civilization,\\" must follow those ideals and principles wherever they exist the strongest in the world.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is the closest book I've read that's come to capturing the charm, humor, and unbridled creativity found within the Harry Potter series. Comparisons are inevitable, and Riordan's hero, Percy Jackson, owes much to Harry Potter. Both story arcs involve a troubled orphan discovering his magical heritage (wizard/half-blood son of a god), who goes to a special school (Hogwarts/half-blood summer camp), acquires some friends (a brainy, plucky girl and a loyal, but somewhat goofy best friend), and must save his world from destruction. But what sets Percy's adventures apart is his voice, replete with a wry sense of humor and a healthy dash of sarcasm, and the way Riordan has placed age-old figures like Zeus and Poseidon in the modern-day world. Seeing the way the mythology now functions in a world of television, cell phones, and all other modern conveniences is hilarious and wildly entertaining. Mortals are blinded to the activities of the gods around them, making for some alternately funny and dangerous misunderstandings. It's wildly funny but appropriate that Ares, the god of war, would masquerade as a threatening biker in California, and that Cerberus, the threatening three-headed dog guarding the entrance to the Underworld, would respond so well to modern-day obedience school techniques, just to name a few of the modern and ancient world mash-ups. Touches like these set The Lightning Thief apart, because the total integration of the real and mythological worlds is so fully-realized.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is an excellent first chapter in Percy's quest to become a hero worthy of his noble paternal heritage. I loved seeing the way Riordan made the mythological and modern-day worlds collide, like when one of the Furies masquerades as a math teacher or Percy's sword is disguised as a ballpoint pen. Camp Half-Blood, where the children of the gods get their training (if they survive monster attacks to adolescence), is a fun little microcosm of what makes this story work. The modern attitudes of all the kids, and how they each express different traits inherited from their immortal parent (and constantly clash with each other) puts a really fun spin on the school/camp angle. Percy's first quest is action-packed from start to finish, and the novel has this perfect balance of humor and intensity that makes it a real page-turner. There are some well-planted hints of the overall threat Percy will surely face by the end of the series, and like the Potter books I suspect each installment will take Percy one step closer to realizing his potential as a full-fledged hero. I'm definitely looking forward to reading the next installment in Percy's adventures.few of the modern and ancient world mash-ups.

B002SJIO5E|1.0|A completely horrible movie. The idea behind it was alright, but the execution was atrocious. It was a boring blend of faux-documentary and tried to perceive a semblance of emotion with the whole family angle. The feeling of the movie is cheap yet the aliens cost money to produce. The film needed a better film direction.
0152067043|5.0|This is a very cute book that shows sheep in opposite situations.  I was very happy  to find it in a board book form.
0765356147|5.0|On its own merits, I would rate \\"The Hero of Ages\\" a solid 4 to 4 1/2 stars.  The characterizations that are Sanderson's strong suit in this series continue to impress.  There are a few minor missteps along the way, or perhaps more items that I find distracting.  Once again, he focuses a great deal on the internal monologues (sometimes dialogues) of his characters' minds.  This is actually a pretty necessary part of the book, but he does tread the same ground over and over again.  As I mentioned in my previous reviews, he never does it in a way that's too annoying, but I did sometimes think to myself, \\"Yeah yeah, I got it already...\\"  That said, I think that he had to tread a fine line there and he pulled it off. If he'd spent less time on the internal workings of characters' minds, the reader may have not been as primed for a few of the revelations that occur, and the revelations are well worth the time spent.    The back of the book refers to an 'audacious' ending, and I've seen similar comments made.  I'm not sure I would go that far, but it _was_ satisfying.  Too often, writers don't seem to know how to end their books in a way that satisfies the story and the reader.  This is one of the very few series that hasn't disappointed.    I will point out that if you like every single thing neatly wrapped up and explained, no loose ends, you probably will be a bit upset.  There are at least a couple of things that appear as though they'll be important and then they just kind of disappear without later reference.  And there's one mystery that remains so when the book ends, but it's not really fundamental to the story itself so I was able to accept that the answer just wasn't going to be given (it sounds likely that the world of Mistborn will be revisited in the future, so this puzzle may yet be explained).    Once again, Sanderson weaves a parallel narrative (brief italicized paragraphs at the start of each chapter) which ties into the main story.  I mentioned in \\"The Well of Ascension\\" that that book made the revelation in \\"The Final Empire\\" even better.  Well, \\"The Hero of Ages\\" makes the first two books even better still and forces you to reassess your opinion of the villains and heroes in the previous stories.    I haven't gone too much into the plot here, because I think the unraveling of the overall story and the puzzles within should be as unspoiled as possible, it really is done exceptionally well.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|The sound is perfect. The packaging is mind-blowingly detailed and accurate. Not just the usual booklet of notes on the material, though that's excellent, but also each disc is a miniature of the original British LP label and sleeve, down to the finest detail. I have all the original Parlophone LPs, which I compared to the miniature disc sleeves, and the reproduction is astonishing. They even duplicated the backwards spine label of the British release of Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band LP. This is a release that gives substance to the term \\"audiophile edition.\\" Now that the price has descended from the clouds, the purchase decision is a no-brainer for anyone who appreciates what the Beatles did.

B0016OMFNY|4.0|This album brought back some serious memories for me. Sure, it was a bad time, but it was music like this that got me through them.    When I popped this disk in my player and heard the familiar notes that I knew by heart it just seemed like all was right with the world.    I used to have this on tape, but I listened to it so much that I literally wore it out. I searched music store after music store and spent many hours looking online for a copy. The best I could ever find was one on eBay for a three digit price. I love this disk, but not that much.    Finally, it popped up on Amazon and I put it in my cart. It would go up and down a dollar every few days until one day it went down a couple of dollars and I figured it was never going to go any lower, so away I clicked.    The sound quality just pops on my car CD player, which is just your average factory player. I don't recall if this was re-mastered or not but to be honest, I wouldn't care if it sounded like a scratchy LP. The only thing I object to is the bonus tracks. I remember this album the way it was and I just find the extra tracks distracting and actually detract from the album, because they're not that good. They seem somehow... out of place.     Still worth the price. Gonna miss George and Roy, though. There's never going to be another project like the Wilburys.    Oh, and for the record (no pun) it's those extra tracks that knocked it down to four stars.
0451228731|4.0|I loved this book when i first started reading it it seemed very exciting and i couldn't wait to see how they would finally destroy the daemon. This does not happen in fact the main person who was fighting to stop the daemon becomes in the second book and at the end of the first working for it to take over the world. i don't know what kind of twisted sense of the world Mr Suarez has but i don't share his views. That being said its still a good exciting story despite the fact the author is a wack job so by all means read it just for entertainment value.

1601251505|5.0|This book is a beauty to behold. Thick, gleaming, colored pages, clear type and great art that evokes that DnD feel.<br /><br />  The updates to classes, races, feats, etc are welcome and really help to give each pc more to do and easier ways to do it. Plus it includes all the nice feats and skills etc that added and gave bonuses to roleplay situations outside of combat. These are things DnD 4e took out using the excuse, \\"well it frees you to do more roleplaying\\" No, it frees you to do play acting without any cool support/rewards within the system. If there are no rules to resolve a situation then you are just plain old acting not roleplaying. Sure DnD will give you a plus 5 to beat the hell outa something, but if you wanna be better at say hunting, tracking, socializing outside of combat? Not so much. PathFinder put the rewarding bits back into the game and then improved upon the 3.5 model. Now not only can you beat the snot out of orcs you can socialize and get some cool stuff and bonuses to doing that to!<br />  And as for combat, it was cleaned up. This includes a universal system for combat manuevers and I find that any manuever not listed would be easy enough to figure out using the new system.<br />  The magic system is pretty much 3.5 but individual spells have been cleaned up and are layed out in an easy to find/read format. Plus many spellcasters get various schools, special abilities etc that allow them to have one or two readily usable spells/spell like abilites so that even when the big guns are tapped you always have something to cast/do!!!<br /><br />  Overall this book is amazing and cleanups up and improves upon 3.5. It really evokes that DnD feel and makes me wanna play/run it right away!!

1416572287|5.0|I'm in med school right now and one thing I never understood while taking the required scientific classes in high school or undergrad was what the heck physics was about.  Math, biology, chemistry were all comparatively easy, but physics always evaded my understanding.  While this book by no means brought me to a level of knowledge comparable to even a 1st year physics student in undergrad, it at least helped me fill part of the void of the one science that I could never grasp.  This gave me at least some tid-bits to help start or carry on a conversation about the topic, whereas I had nothing to go on before (and I wasn't going to pick up a text-book to fill the void in the first place).  This was a great overview of the subject written in lay-mans terms and explained in \\"lay-man language\\".  I'm thinking of reading Hawkings' books right now as they seem to have the same fundamentals of explaining really hard to grasp physics to a larger audience as this book has.  I recommend this book!

B001P9KR8U|1.0|After the rave reviews for this movie--as exhilirating, uplifting, etc, etc. , we were excited about watching it.  Well, we simply were not able to get through the squalor (kid jumps in latrine); violence (electrocuting the contestant to get him to tell them how he knew the answers), random killings including a clubbing death of a young mother simply because she was a different religion, intentional blinding of a young boy in order to create a beggar--and that was just the first 20 minutes.  We guessed the uplifting part came later but it is necessary to watch quite a bit of horror to get to it.  We turned it off and threw it away.  Did not know anyone else that we thought would be able to watch this either.  We hope that it does not depict reality.  Maybe we missed some great cinema but that is fine with us given the price for getting to that part.

B002PMV9FG|1.0|By far the worst episode ever realized as a movie. Really, there are no words to describe the total failure in understanding the leads from this film to the next, there are lots of lacks in the whole story, so much that it has just little to compare with the books. Well of course, as said in other reviews, thanks for making the movies at all but I pass for this one: is it about making money?, please there are ways and ways, and we fans don't deserve to be treated this way. Director (I wish it could be Alfonso Cuaron best Director ever for The prisoner of Azkaban)and Producers we do pay for seeing  this... 'thing' expecting at least something like the Order of the Phoenix, I mean a resemblance from the book but no... it had to be misshaped and ruined. Practically no accordance to the real story and Mrs. Rowling, how could you let this disaster happen? One star just to be able to express this opinion.    As said, there are no words to describe this monumental bad done job. In this film: thanks for nothing or for making us waste our money misserably.
1423119509|5.0|We actually reward our son 5 dollars for every book that he reads. Some parents may have a problem with such reward methods but as long as it gets my son to read instead of playing videogames or watching TV then its worth it and its absolutely worked as he has become an avid reader over the years and has read an impressive number of books overall including many of the classics like Treasure Island and Moby Dick. As long as the subject matter is appropriate, we will buy him any book he wants to read and he usually gives us a list every month or so that has any new books he wants to read on it.<br /><br />Anyways, I had heard a lot of great things about this series and for some reason it had just never come up on any of my sons wish lists. So going off of what I had heard, I went ahead and purchased the hardcover box set anyways and In all honesty they sat on his bookshelf for some time before he decided to pick up the first book. However, once he picked up that first book...well lets just say the rest is history as he read all 5 books very quickly from that point forward. He just couldn't put them down once he got started.<br /><br />As for the books themselves, they are very nice hard cover editions with great art on the covers. This is the complete Percy Jackson and the Olympians series which in case your unaware is 5 books in total.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief<br />The Sea of Monsters<br />The Titans Curse<br />The Battle of the Labyrinth<br />The Last Olympian<br /><br />The books come in a special storage chest and while the books themselves are very nice, I cannot say the same thing about the storage chest. Its just not very high in quality at all and the one we received was a bit dinged up. Its not really a big deal for us as my son prefers keeping the books on his bookshelf, outside of the storage chest. It also comes with some stickers and a Camp Half-Blood map. The map is actually a nice little bonus.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews that I read for these books were actually made by adults who had really enjoyed this series and given my love for fantasy, well I guess it was only a matter of time before I read them myself. I just finished the 3rd book a few weeks back and they really are outstanding. I am a big fan of Roman and Greek history so I just love the Greek mythology angle to these stories. They are just extremely well written and are very hard to put down once you start reading them.<br /><br />The bottom line - While these books are definitely aimed at a younger audience they are still a worthy read even for adults. In fact there is something refreshing about reading books like this that are aimed at a younger audience. If your child loves fantasy and adventure then these books are a no brainer. You can read them when they are done!<br /><br />5 Stars!!books were actually made by adults who had really enjoyed this series and given my love for fantasy, well I guess it was only a matter of time before I read them myself.

0812973992|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Colum McCann's first two novels 'Songdogs' and 'This Side of Brigtness' but haven't read his last two, but definitely decided to return to check him out after all of the accolades this book received. And it is a great book, a fantastic New York story, a realistic portrayal of NYC in the 1970s, a good balance of inter-connected stories without making anything too unbelievable, but I believe something was missing, McCann was clearly reaching to write a 'great American novel' and he wrote a very good one, but not quite up to the expectations and the blurbs that accompany the paperback. So, recommended, but maybe don't read the quotes and hyperbole until after you finish, you'll probably enjoy it more...

0691142165|4.0|This is my eight book review on the financial crisis. My most recent book is This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart. Dr Rogoff is a professor of economics at Harvard University, and Dr Reinhart is a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.    The authors document financial crises that occurred over the past several hundred years.The authors discuss various topics such as currency debasement, banking crises,Default (both domestic and foreign), exchange rate crises, and inflation. All these issues are interrelated and many times all these factors will converge at once.The authors dispel the misconception that there is an difference between emerging markets and developed economies in this regard.    The main theme of the book is that every time a bubble develops in a country whether emerging market or developed, the thinking is the bubble will never burst. The authors describe this attitude as \\"This Time is Different\\". The argument usually goes that our financial systems are more sophisticated now and we have learned from our mistakes, and therefore past bubbles will not be repeated.     This mindset was prevalent in the buildup of the subprime crisis where even sophisticated risk models developed by banks and rating agencies did not include a scenario where home prices decreased. This means that the \\"cream of the crop\\" of Wall Street were convinced housing prices would continue to increase endlessly.     An interesting fact about the book is how the Government lacks transparency in its own finances. The ironic fact is that the Government is always demanding transparency of corporations. However, the Government especially the Federal Reserve has trillions of dollars of liabilities with no accountability and no public knowledge of its finances.    Another interesting the authors point out is the history of the US Government defaulting on debt. Wait the US has never defaulted on its debt? According tothe authors when the US changed its policy on the gold standard that was a de facto default. The authors argue that by making the dollar less valuable the Government was in effect defaulting on its debt. The authors use the same argument in regards to inflation.     The book might be overwhelming due to the sheer amount of information the authors provide. However, anyone with any interest in economics or history will find this book is a gold mine of data. The authors conducted extensive research on financial crises and document it in a coherent manner for the reader to understand. The book is an important publication in understanding previous financial crises and to apply those lessons to the current financial crisis.
0887307280|1.0|This book has truly jolted my senses to reality. Packed with relevant stories about franchises and the many ways to build a business, using GRAND words like entrprenuer and innovation, it truly is a masterpiece. I was a bit confused about where this book would be ideally shelved in a bookstore; although the title may cleverly fool the reader about its subject(business), some of the heart trenching stories in this book can very well be used in the self-help section. There's a great range of philosphers citations, too, ranging from Kierkegaard to Nietzsche's, never mind their vast philosphical difference, this author was able to use one quote from Nietzche that was able to tie his argument so well together, I almost believed him.    All in all, I applaud his clever attempt to come up with such a mastery in such little time, and hope that the readers will look to his franchise model to help build their business and foster their creativity. Afterall, there's only one way to do a successful business, and that is, to find oneself.    The last remark should be about the book's masterpiece: the author's affirming photograph on the back cover...how can a business book be anymore comforting?! This book has been a true inspiration and an assured forward propellant.

0385737947|2.0|I was recommended this book after \\"The Hunger Games\\", and what a letdown.    It's hard to pinpoint what I disliked about the book, as it's not just the one thing.  The main character is the classical \\"Mary Sue\\" type of wish-fulfillment character, practically perfect in every way, which also makes him terribly boring.  The made-up slang is jarringly used, with no apparent origin (what is a \\"slinthead\\"?) and looks like it was inserted into the manuscript via find & replace.  The monsters are apparently some sort of battle-slug, both hard to visualize and not particularly terrifying.  And the plot relies on constant \\"aha!\\" moments, when a character suddenly comes out with a plot point that's got no basis in the story, it's just the next stop in the plot, so hey, now he magically knows it.  It comes across as horribly false.    Worst of all, the characters just aren't smart.  Thomas himself is not intelligent as much as he is given information in a contrived manner.  The girl appears to be making a cameo from a totally different story.  Truly, a frustrating read.    Logically, this book just doesn't hang together.  It's a very disappointing read for anyone who likes smart, scrappy characters who are people rather than just mannequins going through the motions mandated by the plot.  And it's a disappointment for its lack of sense, and... sigh.  It's like the author tried to recreate \\"Ender's Game\\", just without any of the character study, world-building or philosophy.    Save yourself the aggro.  Just go get \\"The Hunger Games\\" or \\"Ender's Game\\".  This book's got very few brains and no heart.
1416572287|5.0|But it's still a fabulous book, if you're wanting to learn about quantum physics (it doesn't cover \\"physics\\" in a more general sense very well).  That said, using the \\"conversations with dog\\" approach to simplify the concepts (while entertaining the reader) works exceptionally well, and the author does a great job at presenting a somewhat complex subject in a way that even a modestly-interested reader would find hard to abandon.  Well-written, informative, and easy to read.  It's a keeper!

B0006AAS5G|4.0|The Invicta Speedway 9211 has all the looks of the Rolex Daytona for $11,900 less and instant availability.  There are a few features that are lacking however, which detracts from the overall score.  The watch has a mineral glass crystal which isn't as scratch resistant as sapphire.  I haven't had a problem yet, but I've been careful while wearing this watch.  The 9211 is also powered by a no-name japanese quartz movement, I would much prefer to see an automatic movement powering this one, but for cost concerns the quartz works just fine.  My third complaint is that the steel used from the polished portions is soft and thus scratches very easily.  I didn't think that it would be as bad as everyone made it out to be, but it really is and then some.   The softness also should make them easy to polish out, but that's a bit of a PITA that really isn't necessary.  Overal, the watch keeps good time and has drop-dead good looks, and is a screaming value at $99.  This watch could easily sell for twice that and still be a good buy.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I bought this for somebody else. I am a big fan of Peggy Lee, Ella Fitzgerlad, Eartha Kitt and all the rest....too amny to mention here. I was floored! What a great disc!

The songs just flow and they demand you listen not Just stay background noise. None of these are over produced or trendy.
0786939532|3.0|This is the first Drizzt book I've read, and my second foray into the dark elf world (after my failed attempt at the War of the Spider Queen). Homeland is decent, but overall uneventful. Drizzt is pretty predictable, and he is just as flat as all of the other dark elves. The elves are out for revenge and out to be slaves to females and the spider queen. For some reason none of the males have ever tried to rise up, and they all believe the rhetoric they are brought up hearing. Faeries are bad, the surface is dangerous, and it's ok to kill anyone you want as long as you are successful. Dark elves are supposed to be evil, yet they seem pretty submissive and respectful to me. I would love to read a book about evil backstabbing dark elves. A novel with a substantial plot and substantially less fight scenes. All of the dark elf books I've read are more like video games than dynamic novels. Mages can only use a few spells before they have to rest, if they can use them at all, most of the game is spent fighting, and there are plenty of words to read that don't add up to much. I've definitely played that game before. Homeland would have been more interesting if there was more of a plot than one survivor of a house slowly and submissively vying for revenge. It would have been more interesting if the characters had more substance. It just didn't wow me, and I think I'm done with the dark elf world unfortunately.

1400052173|5.0|Rebecca Skloot has written a book that certainly sounds like it could be science fiction, but in truth it is incredible science. However, it's not only about the science, but more importantly about who is behind it all. She has put a very real face to one of the most important medical research discoveries of our lifetime and given an appropriate name to the HeLa cells used in that research all over the world; Henrietta Lacks.<br /><br />This book recounts the life of Henrietta, the death of Henrietta and the immortal cells she left behind that became the basis of many life saving discoveries in the medical field. HeLa cells are those which were taken from Henrietta's cancerous tumor many decades ago. They were easily replicated and viable for testing therefore they became an important staple in laboratories doing medical research right up to the present. Many have her cells to thank for their treatment and cures of deadly diseases.<br /><br />Sounds like a generous donation to the medical community, doesn't it? But, what if Henrietta and her family had no idea any of this had taken place? They didn't know that her doctor had taken the cells, and upon realizing how unique they were, shared and traded them with other researchers. They especially were unaware that these were eventually being sold for a profit among labs and medical companies. Was this a case of explotation or was it simply how science progresses?<br /><br />The author finds the surviving family of Mrs. Lacks and realizes there is far more to the story than it would first appear. She touches on each of the sensitive topics that present themselves as the family approaches her with so many questions left unanswered. The more I read, the more fascinated I became with the complexities.<br /><br />The Lacks family are uneducated and living in poverty, struggling to understand how their loved one could have saved so many lives while her own could not be saved. They find it hard to believe their mother has done so much for the medical community, and made some companies millions of dollars, yet they cannot even afford good medical care. They wonder how cells were named after her yet there was no true recognition of her by her full, real name. The children hope that Ms. Skloot will not be another journalist to take advantage of them, but that she will give their mother the place she deserves as a real person, not just a \\"cell donor\\". Ms. Skloot does exactly that and I believe they would be very happy with the care she has given to the subject.<br /><br />It's my opinion that everyone studying medicine & science should read this book to gain insight as to the genuine lives of patients. The understanding that there is much more to a person than their cells, their lab results, their disease, etc., is such an important lesson to be learned. To take a quote from the book, stated by the assistant who helped retrieve the cells while Henrietta was in the morgue, \\"When I saw those toenails I nearly fainted. I thought, Oh geez, she's a real person. I started imagining her sitting in her bathroom painting those toenails, and it hit me for the first time that those cells we'd been working with all this time and sending all over the world, they came from a live woman. I'd never thought of it thay way\\".<br /><br />I would also highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the ethical and legal aspects of the medical and scientific communities. There is also a significant component relating to the Johns Hopkins, the black community and black history. Every aspect was fascinating and eye-opening.<br /><br />If you are wondering how this could have happened, be warned that it could just as easily happen to any of us tomorrow, as there are still no laws in place preventing any doctor or hospital from keeping and using our tissue, or our children's umbilical blood, or our parents tumors for research once collected. Perhaps it is better that we all contribute to furthering scientific discoveries. But, you might rethink \\"immortality\\" after hearing this story. Just one more good reason to read this book.ring this story. Just one more good reason to read this book.
B002W6Z0UK|4.0|I really enjoy the up beat of this CD.  I find myself tapping my foot on the subway.  Hopefully I not singing too!
0739383728|2.0|This book was tough to read.  Like many of this genre, it treats chapters like cheesie made for TV movies.  You are reading about a point in time and then one of the characters says something...cut away to past sequence.  It's really annoying if you enjoy your books to be time linear.  I've noticed this \\"style\\" in other books and I just want to say STOP THAT.      Obviously the author did not interact with the \\"hidden tribe\\" very much because there is 1) very little information about them other than brief encounters and glorifying their way of living.  2)  no photos.  Even the cover is misleading.  He states that the Indians wear mid thigh length skirts.  The guy on the cover is clearly wearing shorts.        I don't know...this book felt fictionalized to make up for lack of content.

B002SJIO4A|3.0|CHEEPNIS of course is the song by Zappa, an homage to all the bad scifi ( syfy ) movies he watched as a kid. District 9 reminded me of lots of those movies. Remember the early scifi film where the astronaut comes home with an alien fungus on his arm which eventually envelops his entire body! Or THE FLY, where the man has a giant fly head! This movie, DISTRICT 9, borrows from lots of those films; but it borrows in a good way and an original way. And DISTRICT 9 is filmed in such a different way that it really does not remind us of any other film. The story has many problems, and requires huge leaps of faith to remain cohesive. But if we go along it is worth it. For me, just watching the aliens move is worth it. The alien design and the motion capture is astounding.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|This book is a page turner from beginning to end. I have a child of my own and I thought I can't possibly get through this book at the beginning.

It's a different angle of it. Great writing!

B000IZA9PI|2.0|Though its production values are excellent, this is easily the worst of the Star Trek Next Generation movies.  The story is stupid, even by liberal Star Trek standards, and it contradicts other established story lines. It took four or five novels to fill in the blanks just to make the movie fit into Star Trek lore. It is no wonder the producers and writers of the latest Star Trek movie chose to re-start the entire series' story after this.<br /><br />If you just want to see cool space battles, this is the movie for you.  If you are a Star Trek fan, you will be unhappy.
0743277465|1.0|I've come away from this book with an awful impression of \\"Mr.\\" Waitzkin.  He blames his failure to proceed any further in his chess career on everybody but himself.  His portrait of Mark Dvoretsky as a veritable ogre is absolutely disgraceful and seems colored more by his disagreement with Dvoretsky's training suggestions than anything.  More than once too the author portrays his opponents at chess tournaments after the publicity surrounding the Searching for Bobby Fischer movie as \\"seething with jealousy\\".  Really, 29 year-old (now 30 something) man-child, get over yourself.  Nobody this obviously immature could possibly have anything worthwhile to teach about how to learn.

B00004ZD69|5.0|I have discovered Godspeed and post-rock a decade too late because during the time it was burgeoning I was in graduate school and not paying as much attention to music as I should have been.  I picked up \\"F#A#(Infinity)\\" [[ASIN:B000007T2Z f#a# (infinity symbol)]]from my local library and was absolutely BLOWN away.  I have since purchased everything of GYBE I can find.  I love them all.  This is a great CD if you need more, but as a first GYBE album, I would start with \\"F#A#(Infinity)\\" because it is near-perfect.  I am now searching for other bands that are similar in quality to these guys (and girls)...if anyone has any suggestions!???  I got a list of post-rock bands off of Wikipedia, but there are sooooo many it is difficult to begin.  And the ones I started looking at via You Tube or My Space did not seem to have any resemblance at all to GYBE.
B0029O08WA|1.0|I bought this because, even though I dislike Twilight in general, I'd found the first film's soundtrack to be pretty good. Oh, what a waste of money and time. This CD was terrible. The only song I even remotely liked was the single, \\"Meet Me on the Equinox\\". Everything else was so bland and sound-alike that I could hardly tell where one song left off and the next began. What an over-hyped yawn -- just like the rest of the pathetic cash cow franchise known as the Twilight \\"Saga\\".
B000007XUQ|5.0|First, I have always been a Carpenters fan. I love Karen's voice. This is a 2 disc set and it is composed of \\"Christmas Portrait\\" and \\"An Old Fashioned Christmas\\". On both discs, unlike their singles Karen and Richard do not harmonize together, but do their own work. There is Richard playing piano and keyboard and singing on his own, and Karen on her own. \\"Portrait\\" has the most popular Christmas songs while \\"Old Fashioned..\\" Has other popular songs and songs like \\"Little Alter Boy\\" that you don't often hear at Christmas. Richard plays a selection from \\"The Nutcracker\\". The Carpenter's Christmas Albums have always ranked in the top ten best Christmas albums since their albums were created.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|District 9 is an excellent science-fiction film with a different approach. Aliens land in South Africa and are quarantined in slums much like other races that man doesn't understand. The movie is shot in a news documentary style that adds believability to the plot. There are no well-known actors (at least to American audiences), that give solid performances that do not detract from the story. Great digital aliens and special effects, that are enhanced by viewing the making of special features on the Blu ray disc, that I suggest viewing before watching the film itself to appreciate the effort that went into the production. Holds up well even on several viewings to take it all in with top-notch Blu ray sound and picture quality.
1419802356|5.0|An odd young man, who collects family momentos in plastic baggies, travels to the Ukraine for a Jewish heritage tour. He seeks answers about who was the woman in the photo with his grandfather standing in the Ukrainian wheat field in 1942?<br />Serving as his translator on the road trip across the Ukraine is a glib young man who often mangles English. The translator's grandfather, a taciturn character, drives them. The grandfather's insane dog livens up the trip.<br />The viewer is often left wondering (what did he say? what did that mean?) but hangs on for the ride. There is humor, pathos, history, ethnic music and hiphop and glorious scenery to enjoy along the way. Eventually the role of the Ukrainian grandfather becomes clear and the ways their lives touch and blend ends the movie in a sad but illuminating way.

If you only know Meryl Streep as a serious actress, you'll see she can do wacky, wisecracking, physical humor, and passive and physical aggression, as well as Goldie Hawn, who did an awesome job in this movie.  Also, I found the serious Romulan-like character played by Isabella Rossellini to be the most amusing in the movie after Hawn's and Streep's.      I greatly enjoyed the acting, dialogue, and the increasingly wacky and unbelievable plot of this movie.  In addition, the impressive special effects were used to advance the plot as opposed to showing them off for the sake of adding shock and awe.  I think most viewers will either love this movie or hate it, and will know which category they're in about a half hour in.  If you like dark cynical comedies, you won't want to miss this one.

0440238609|4.0|The Golden Compass was very enjoyable with great characters, good and evil, and an immensely interesting story.  The parallel world is well imagined and believable; and if the protagonist, Lyra, is a bit of brat with an unearned super-ability and remarkable aplomb for an 11-year-old, her story is so well written that you can suspend your disbelief if it occurs.  The cliff-hanger ending which turns Lyra's mission on its head is the perfect lead-in for the second act.  Too bad that it doesn't follow through with the initial promise.  The Silver Knife immediately started to water down the original brilliance and slides rapidly into a splintered morass in the third book, The Amber Spyglass.  The new characters introduced to the plot are not as interesting as the originals.  Such as Will, another child with amazing abilities.  He also gets an object which enables him to quickly assume hero status, like Lyra, which stretches credulity, especially as he is rather dull in his awesomeness, unlike Lyra.  But Lyra's fire begins to leech away, once she joins forces with Will, and she becomes as colorless as the universe ends up by the third book.  Formerly evil characters begin to reveal an unsuspected sweet side and by the end commit such a selfless act (and wrapped up in such cliched tripe, especially considering how the characters were initially drawn, that I gagged over the dialogue) that I actually felt the characters had been betrayed by their author.  Mary, the supposed all-important catalyst, simply tells a story near the end of Spyglass that somehow leads Lyra and Will to the near-instantaneous saving of the universe (and Dust?).  The method of that saving is just . . . poorly thought out, nonsensical, and utterly wastes the promise shown in The Golden Compass.  All the effort and heroics lead to a bleak universe and nobody ends happily.  And for no real good reason except the author said so, even if it contradicts what has been outlined in the previous books.  Collectively, the trilogy would get 3 1/2 starts.  Read the first book, then resist the urge, no matter how powerful, to finish the series.  You'll likely be disappointed, as I was.
B000063T0T|3.0|I really can't add anything to this review that hasn't already been said; there are a lot of original film version songs that are missing; I wanted to hear the songs as sung by the actors in the film. It's my fault for not reading the description of the songs thoroughly, I had assumed I'd be getting the music from the movie instead of remakes. It's still good, just not what I really wanted.
B001C4AFOY|4.0|The delightfully dallying Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York, treats us to a beautifully costumed glimpse of the political and power machinations that go on no matter the era behind the palace door in her production of \\"Young Victoria\\" directed by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e and written by Julian Fellowes.<br /><br />Flamboyant Ferguson, once married to Prince Andrew of the UK, knows firsthand just how much of an outsider someone married to a royal can be even in his/her own household.  Obviously intrigued by her subject matter as illustrated with the elaborate attention to detail, Ferguson uses the outsider theme in her recounting of the story of Victoria Regina (1819-1901) and VR's ascent to the throne of England at eighteen years old in 1837 but also explores `what could have been' for herself and her modern day prince if they had not allowed the politics and manner plays of the realm interfere with their life together.<br /><br />Living as a virtual prisoner in the home of her mother, the Duchess of Kent and the Duchess's lover/adviser Sir John Conroy, Victoria endures a restrictive childhood with no companionship of her own age; her dog, Dash, albeit an adorable King Charles spaniel does little to promote her experience of the outside world or prepare her for her coming role as queen.  Thought of as a pawn to be controlled by either an appointed regent, a husband, or trusted adviser, Victoria must remain focused; understand her weaknesses and work towards a strong independence that will aid her in taking her place as one of Great Britain's greatest monarchs.  The film transports the young princess from captivity to competence and sees her growth from unsure and stubborn ing&eacute;nue to more-in-control young queen, wife and mother.<br /><br />Ferguson's concept succeeds admirably; \\"The Young Victoria\\" is a first rate film in the genre of Masterpiece Theatre, replete with the lush backdrops of the royal British lifestyle (exquisite gardens, Buckingham Palace, and castles, Arundel and Belvoir ) and beautifully recreated 19th century costumes.  However, most compelling for this reviewer and her fellow very vocal older audience members was the film's ability to convey the advance and balance of the developing romance between this queen and her consort from the viewpoint of Victoria as unsure insider and Albert as the German prince who most certainly was at first a guest within his own home.  What Ferguson did not get right in her own  life, she more than adequately conveys here.<br /><br />Emily Blunt ([[ASIN:B000J103OI The Devil Wears Prada (Full Screen Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00009MEKC Warrior Queen]]) plays the young repressed princess with a believable uncertain precision--her role as Victoria contrasts remarkably with the acerbic over anxious assistant to Meryl Streep in \\"The Devil Wore Prada.\\"  Wonderful to look at, Rupert Friend ([[ASIN:B002K0WBXM Cheri]], [[ASIN:B000GYI3PY Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont]]) gives Albert, Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, male model sexiness that had many of the audience's older women cooing at his earnest smiles and endearing dimples. However, he is not just a pretty face; his ability to personify a steel core within a pleasant persona admirably depicts the dilemma his character faced throughout his twenty years as Victoria's husband.<br /><br />Secondary players Miranda Richardson as Victoria's mother and Mark Strong as the Snidely Whiplash villain, Conroy, smolder with insecurity and the wrath that ensues when one's orders are not followed to the letter. Almost unrecognizable--a tribute to his chameleonic ability to become any character--is Paul Bettany ([[ASIN:B0006A9FIM Wimbledon]], [[ASIN:B000FVQLQQ A Beautiful Mind]]) as Lord Melbourne, the ambitious and politically minded PM.<br /><br />The combination of worthy players and intriguing plotline keeps the hour and 45 minute playing time a moving feast of period drama, political power and sweet romance that will wow any lover of the Masterpiece Theatre genre.  Despite some historical inaccuracies (Albert never took a bullet for Victoria although there were multiple assassination attempts on her life), the interplay between the two leads cannot fail to charm.<br /><br />Bottom Line?  Sarah Ferguson along with Martin Scorsese produces and arrestingly lovely film depicting the first years of Queen Victoria's long reign as monarch of Great Britain.  Telling the parallel stories of her romance with her first cousin, the German Prince Albert and her maturation with regard to court politics and her role as the empire's figurehead, \\"The Young Victoria\\" provides an intriguing entertainment for the Masterpiece Theatre set who cannot get enough of costumes, elaborate sets and the mannered sensibilities that act as decoy for machinations that do not change with any age.  The audience that I viewed the film with commented enthusiastically about the production afterward, repeatedly exclaiming that it was one of the `best films' they had seen in years.

B000001GQP|5.0|This is Jochum's stereo remake recording of 1968, the original made in horrible mono early in 1950.  By far and wide his remake is so much of a stunning success that is has achieved classic status, and has not been out of print once since it's original release.<br /><br />Eugen Jochum was a long time friend of Carl Orff's and even though Carl Orff was present in both recordings he gave his official authorization on Jochum's '68 rendition.<br /><br />The stunning clarity and characterfullness of the chorus is quite beautuful in a very special and eerie kind of way.  Dieskau and Stolz are immaculate and deeply impressive in their roles and Janowitz must be the best soprano in all of Carmina Buranas!  She soars as no other, its almost crazy the intense beauty and ravishing tones she exceeds to!  The children's chorus also must be in my opinion the most wonderful and divine sounds I've heard a children chorus produce...even though they may only have a small role in Carmina Burana.<br /><br />This is an important and very special Carmina Burana and I keep coming back to it consistently to know \\"how\\" Orff should be played in all it's aspects!<br /><br />Absolutely fantastic!!!

1844560694|5.0|Several reviews already cover why this utterly gripping book is a great novel more eloquently than I can. But I just wanted to share that if you have a chance to listen to the audiobook (even if you have read the book) do so without hesitation! Rarely do I find (if ever) a 16 CD novel being a 'page-turner'. More importantly, the problems most reviewers mentioned with some chapters being hard to read or distracting due to choice of words or writing style etc. simply vanish in audiobook version and the story flows without a hitch.     Each story is narrated by a different person. My absolute favorite parts are the Timothy Cavendish chapters which were simply hilarious and read with virtuoso by John Lee. I found it even funnier than when I previously read the book. In fact, I actually liked the whole book even more after listening to the unabridged audio version. Great narrators deliver a memorable performance. Scott Brick (The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing), Richard Matthews (Letters from Zedelghem), Cassandra Campbell (Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery), Kim Mai Guest (An Orison of Sonmi~451), Kirby Heyborne (Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After).

0374139563|5.0|Excluding the endnotes, the book is barely over 150 pages long.  However in those few pages the author presents a strong case that the billions in foreign aid money stimulates corruption and rarely actually helps the poor.   However, unlike others who are justly critical of Aid, most of the book is dedicated to offering proven alternative solution like microcredit.  She also discusses the role of government bonds, remittances, and direct foreign investment.
B000063V8R|5.0|Let's face it folks, season 1 stunk, then in season 2, we saw some improvement, then we get to this, season 3, and what a season it is, this is where the show really made it's mark, the writers, the actors were comfortable in their roles now, and from here on out, this series is just AMAZING, from the character development, to the writing of the stories, to the acting, everything falls into place on this season.    First and foremost, Beverly Crusher is back!, while I didn't mind pulowski at all, she was quite cool, but let's face it, Beverly is an excellent character, and this show needed her presence, her relationship with Data is much better than Pulowski's was, as well as her relationship with Picard.    Secondly, the uniforms have been changed, AND FOR THE BETTER, they look SO much better in these than the previous ones, much more fitting.    Third, a bit of the intro sequence has changed, for the better as well, where it was changed was all the space phenomena before Picard has his speech, and it looks so beautiful.    I cannot express in words the excellence of this season (and the series from here on out), it's just so well done, genuine, and original, whereas most of the first season plots seemed like a bad rip-off of TOS, (and don't think I am putting TOS down, because I certainly am not, thats what got me into Star Trek), but enough of the 1st season, this season is where someone should start if they want to check out this series, although season 2 is pretty good as well, but it doesn't hold a candle to this season.    Standout episodes for me.    Evolution, Booby Trap, The Survivors, Who Watches The Watchers, The Defector, The Hunted, The High Ground, Deja Q, A Matter of Perspective, Yesterday's Enterprise (of course), The Offspring, Sins of the Father, Tin Man, Hollow Pursuits, and Sarek.    The only sub-par episodes for me were 'The Bonding' although it would get interesting near the end, and 'Captain's Holiday' had much potential, with the story, butI don't think it worked, at least it didn't for me.    But hey, that's 2 episodes out of 26, what are the odds!    And if you end up loving this season as I did, I highly recommend season 4, season 5, season 6 and 7.
0385532458|4.0|The author starts on the dedication page with a short summary of his beginnings as a writer.  He notes, \\"When a Time to Kill was published twenty years ago, I soon learned the painful lesson that selling books was far more difficult than writing them.  I bought a thousand copies and had trouble giving them away.

I started reading some of the reviews about them and wasn't liking what i was reading, but plugged them set everything up to my liking and they work great no hissing sound that i could hear like others was stating unless there was dead air and i had them turned completely up I could get them to hiss but other than that they work great.  the sound quality really gives you that feeling of being there I have caught myself couple times looking over my shoulder to see who was coming up behind me.  The idea of chat volume and game sound separate is great feature now you can hear your buddies to make battle plans without game noise interfering with chat or vice verse.  Music play back is pretty good but not comparable to my Yamaha headset which is made for that I don't hear much difference with the bass boost on/off or all the way up.  A Great buy for the price and sound quality, I have too give it a 5 out of 5.

Simon tells Inspector Walter Cobb that McClane is going to play a game called \\"Simon Says\\". He says that McClane is going to do the tasks he assigns him. If not, he'll blow off another bomb. With the help of a Harlem electrician, John McClane must race all over New York trying to figure out the frustrating puzzles that the crafty terrorist gives him.

Die Hard: With a Vengeance is so well constructed, so well acted and so well directed that I like it just as much, if not better, than Die Hard. Die Hard: With a Vengeance is a spectacle of a tightly told, thrilling action/adventure story.

B000RW3VD4|5.0|Bud Fox is an ambitious stock trader who will do just about anything to get into the big leagues. He has been actively courting Gordon Gekko, one of the biggest stock speculators on Wall Street. Gekko manipulates the market using inside information and his motto best describes his approach: greed is good. Nothing will stop him from pursuing a good deal and he takes advantage of Bud's burning to desire to succeed. Soon, Bud finds himself getting information from any source and using to gain an advantage. It all comes to a head however when Gekko targets Blue Star airlines, the company where Bud's father has worked for 24 years, secretly planning to break it up and plunder the employees' retirement fund.  Super-slick, wickedly intelligent and definitely a very entertaining movie, \\"Wall Street\\" continues to strike a chord when looking back at a very unique time of American economic history.

0739319175|4.0|If you enjoy author Dan Brown's two previous Robert Langdon  novels (Angeles & Demons and The Da Vinci Code), you will love this book. It is filled with those entertaining asides and historical information that his main character , our favorite symbolist,  seems to know so well. The amazing information as well as history asides are woven into this text, which sometimes  feels too heavy handedly.<br /><br />I am in love with the storytelling talents of Paul Micheal's narrative abilities. This is why the unabridged version is the novel is better to get than the abridged one. The abridgement is also by Random House audio.  One may assume that this unabridged seems overly padded. In this reviewer's opinion, I agree. However, Micheal audio talents are a treat, so you can overlook the author's padding.<br /><br /> It  takes a long time to get to the solution, so is the puzzle that this audio is worth it. I would say so. The end of the audio (and the novel) seems slightly overkill. Also you can see some of the red herring so bad that they smell fishy before the listener gets involved. Also the  brazen overkill that Law Enforcement/Government agents  play in this story makes them this side of the Keystone cops. Part of the twist you can predict and see them , right before they hit you in the eyes.<br /><br />For those who seek a historical  adventure  thriller similar to National Treasure or Indiana Jones film, this audio book is a good choice. This heavy handed work is slight overkill but is still entertaining.<br /><br /> I still cannot wait until Tom Hanks does the film version of this book which is fast tracked for next year.<br /> Bennet Pomerantz AUDIOWORLD
B000WBZ5M0|4.0|The last time we saw Danny Ocean's crew, they were paying back ruthless casino mogul Terry Benedict after stealing millions from him. However, it's been a while since they've come back together, which is all about to change. When one of their own, Reuben Tishkoff builds a hotel with known casino owner Willy Banks, the last thing he ever wanted was to get cut out of the deal personally by the loathsome Banks. Banks' attitude even goes so far as to finding the amusement in Tishkoff's misfortune when the double crossing lands Reuben in the hospital because of a heart attack. However, Danny and his crew won't stand for Banks and what he's done to a friend. Uniting with their old enemy Benedict, who himself has a vendetta against Banks, the crew is out to pull off a major plan. One that will unfold on the night Banks' newest hot spot opens up, when the crew is out to bankrupt one of the city's most despised businessmen. But they're not in this for the money, but for the revenge. I highly recommend it, its cool, funny slick and most importantly of all, very cool.
B000YABIQ6|1.0|This time we go back to the early 1960's and the Kennedy years where Hollywood attempts to replace our memories of a much more innocent, moral and gentler American with a dark degraded and dysfunctional culture.  In this version all housewives are depressed and seeing shrinks, all husbands cheat, everybody drinks, smokes and slaps their kids around.  The critics like to call this show intelligent, they don't say why and I'm not sure either.  Maybe it's because of the liberal and gratuitous references to the holocaust and nazi's (which are completely out of place in a conference room in an advertising agency in the 1960's).   If you like shows that are  anti-christian you'll like this.  After all if you write the script you control the content, right?

Lift those cell-phones in the air and light up the stadium, concert goers!<br /><br />\\"This Is War\\" is Jared Leto's big statement. There's plenty of rising up to be done here, with victory, faith, and railing against the oppressors. Youthful choirs raise hopefully from song after song, with militaristic beats propelling Leto as he goes from whispers to screams. The music itself follows suit, with crashing, anthemic guitars blasting through barricades like U2 hadn't been invented yet. Lead single \\"Kings and Queens\\" is a penultimate radio record, all meat and huge hooks, utterly destroying any chance of you noticing how derivative the song itself is. Same with \\"Night Of The Hunter,\\" \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" and the title track.<br /><br />That pretty much describes \\"This Is War\\" overall. Like any good actor, Leto knows his moves and his music is both crowd pleasing and widescreening. Heck, I could imagine this being played under the visuals for \\"Avatar,\\" or even some sci-fi cheese like \\"Starship Troopers.\\" The big, emotive roar that is 30 Seconds to Mars - and worked so well on [[ASIN:B000A7Q2DM A Beautiful Lie]] - is still in full effect here, and \\"This Is War\\" is a really ambitious sounding album. However, the constant battle-cries that push this album to nearly an hour's running time eventually weigh it down, and when you compare it to the similarly themed Muse CD [[ASIN:B002GZQYMK The Resistance]], \\"This Is War\\" ultimately comes up short.

B000002B1M|5.0|Sometimes people can't let things go. Regardless if you sing R&B, play jazz music or emcee, everyone wants to compare you to your first recording. A quote from hip hop artist Common, \\"They wanted another Resurrection/I can't go back...progression.\\" This quote is important because it fits Nas' career to a tee. Everytime he emcees, cats just keep holding on to Illmatic. My people, \\"LET IT GO!\\" It Was Written is no different. Instead of appreciating a classic album, the Illmatic comparisons keep cropping up. It Was Written is as lyrically strong as Illmatic. Tracks such as The Message, Street Dreams, I Gave You Power, If I Ruled The World & Take It In Blood displays Nas' lyrical superiority. The bonus cut, Silent Murder is Nas at his best. Yes, like any classic sometimes you have missteps. Nas Is Coming is a very cheesy Dr. Dre track & even Nas' mic skills can't save it. Affirmative Action would have been a great song if Foxy was not on it. All in all, It Was Written is a classic hip hop album. Once again, please stop with the Illmatic comparisons. When the Bulls went 72-10 it was Mj's best year as a basketball player, but does it mean his other 5 title runs were bogus because they didn't compare with the 72-10 record? 6 championships are 6 championships. The same goes for Nasir Jones, a classic album is a classic album.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|If you're going to use this headset for gaming, it's pretty good.  You basically plug it in somewhere inline (the RCA jacks on the P21 are tees), and that's it. The sound is really good, the cord is extra long (16'), the chat function works great (you can hear yourself in the headset, so you don't shout, which is cool -- and the chat has a separate volume control).  It is light, and wears well for extended periods if you're hardcore.    But: If you're going to use this headset for anything but gaming, like listening to music or watching movies, don't bother.  There is a low background hiss, white noise, that can't be fixed -- believe me, I've tried.  I went to the Shack and bought some RF chokes, and installed about 4 of them on the cord at various places... it reduced the hiss a bit, but not by much.  I was going to buy a ground loop filter as well, but I read a review on another site where some guy tried that too, but he said that didn't work either, so I decided not to throw my money away.  And: the Stereo Expander switch just makes the hiss worse.  I leave it off.  It's not really a selling point, when it further ruins the sound.  Also: when you're not using chat, it helps to turn the volume all the way down on the chat knob... that will reduce hiss further.    I don't want to over-exaggerate the hiss, in fairness to Turtle Beach.  The hiss truly is really low: I play GTA 4 and God of War, and once the game starts, you can't tell it's there anymore.  Game sounds drown it out.  Frankly, you get used to it after a while.  So it's not THAT big a deal.  But for frakin seventy bucks?  Come on.  If I'd have known beforehand, I might have waited until they resolved the issue.  I own another TB headset (Earforce HPA2 for my desktop), which I've been very satisfied with, so that's why I didn't read any reviews or think twice about buying the P21... but I am a bit disappointed, considering that I know they make quality stuff.  I intend to wait until I've read that they'vefixed the issue, buy a new set, and sell this old one for whatever I can get.    This last thing is a tip, for people who are hooking their PS3s to a computer monitor, instead of their TVs, and are trying to figure out how to get sound -- If you have this issue, the P21 works fine (it took a bit of research for me to figure this out -- so I'll help you out.  I ain't rich, and I have a junk TV, but gamer for life, right?)    Basically, you have to use both the stock PS3 cord AND an HDMI-to-DVI cord (actually, I bought a regular HDMI cord, and an HDMI to DVI gender changer, which was cheaper).  For video, I hooked up to my 22\\" computer monitor via the HDMI to DVI adapter.  But of course, DVI doesn't carry sound, so: I connected the stock PS3 cord, which has 3 RCAs (red and white for sound, and yellow for video, which you don't use) to the P21.  THEN: you go to the PS3 \\"Settings\\" menu, and set the Video for \\"HDMI\\", and the Audio for \\"Audio Input Connector\\".  So that's the workaround -- happy gaming.

B00000J7SS|1.0|All the other negative reviews are right.  This album is *literally* a collection of random noise, and not much more.  Whether not it's \\"music\\" or \\"art\\" depend completely on your definitions of music and art.<br /><br />If the noise a busy city makes is music, then this album is music.  If paint splattered randomly on a canvas is art, then sure, this album is art.  But be forewarned; most of this album lacks any discernible beat or key.  You will not be able to tap your foot to it, and when each song is over, you're not going to know whether or not it ended on the tonic.<br /><br />I don't personally consider this album a work of art, or a collection of music.  Sure, the timbre of miles' trumpet or the keys can be pleasing to the ear just for their own sake; but there is no musical organization in the traditional sense to be found anywhere on this album, and like the reviewer above me said, listening to this album is more of an endurance test than an enjoyable experience.
079073639X|5.0|**take this in mind before viewing***    most of the reviews written are biased and can't be taken seriously.  Does no one want to just take a movie by face value anymore?      Everyone has commentary on its content, how it was done, the ending, the action and fx during the crucial points.      This is how you need to watch this movie:    Go into it as you would view things when you are a child!!  Don't expect anything except to have a good story told.  Its in this way that you get a really great story from the movie.      I feel that when people say the ending is crap, well, they have a skewed sense of things.  Thats basically been the same ending for the past 70 yrs from the original of the original books.  Does everyone need a \\"kick in the face\\" type of ending.  BAD GUY LOSES, GOOD GUY WINS. YESSSS!!!!!!!  I find it hilarious that people can't stand it if no one wins or the good guy dies or EVERYONE dies or if there is just the mystery left.      Does anything in life end so definitively???  the answer is mostly no, so in that case, why would movies always have to end with a definite conclusion!?  Just accept that the stars do a GREAT job interacting, don't be so harsh and judge the movie off of what seems to an INCREDIBLY narrow-minded perspective of action/sci-fi/fiction movies.     When you open up your imagination, stop caring about fx and needing an evil vs. good super ending of battle to the death with a definitive ending, thats when you realize this is an amazing movie.      it is a mystery movie, plain and simple, and if you can't handle mysteries, this is not a movie for you.

B002VPE1B6|3.0|EDIT: October 13, 2010    \\"Avatar\\" is groundbreaking as far as special effects go. Cameron's enormous performance-capture stage, the Volume, dwarfs anything Weta Digital has ever used before, and the system used for facial rendering is another level above what was used for the PS3 games \\"Heavenly Sword\\" and \\"Enslaved: Odyssey to the West\\", both of which are as beautifully rendered as this film.    Avatar is living, breathing art: every frame is filled with eye-popping colors and effects unlike anything ever seen on the big screen before, or since. Cameron once mentioned in an interview that Pandora was inspired by these \\"phantasmagorical\\" dreams he once had, and boy howdy, do they look it. The plants and animals look as though they were dredged up from the bottom of the sea and given legs and lungs, and due to the bioluminescence most look like they were crossbred with jellyfish sometime in the past. If the film is viewed as art and not for the done-to-death predictable story, \\"Avatar\\" certainly surpasses anything ever seen before or since, as I have said.    The plot is minimalistic at best, but the script is very well done. Each character sounds and acts unique, with performances by the actors executed with great skill. Without actors and actresses this talented, the film would really be a lot more boring. Cameron shows off his legendary humorous one-liners and love for big battle scenes, as well as his skill with emotion. Whether or not one believes that the film is manipulative, there is no denying that it manages to pull on the proverbial heartstrings at times.    \\"Avatar\\" probably belongs as more of an art house film than a winter blockbuster, but as it stands, it is certainly setting the bar for upcoming so-called \\"winter blockbusters\\". The next big-budget winter blockbuster, as it looks now, is \\"Tron Legacy\\"; now we will wait and see if the trend continues.    \\"Avatar\\" is best seen on the big screen in 3D, but with an HD TV and Blu-ray, the overall effect dissipates only a little. Don't even bother getting the 3D version next year - even if polarized lenses or Dolby 3D technology replaces those heavy, headache-inducing LCD shutter glasses, \\"Avatar\\" is best seen in true high definition with the highest possible refresh rate. It's a true masterpiece of digital art that, although becoming quickly forgotten, will remain on the \\"most influential for CGI technology\\" list for a while.    ---    ORIGINAL REVIEW: January 20, 2010    Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a parapalegic Marine, is sent to Pandora to replace his twin brother in the AVTR program. Through the program, he is allowed to take control of his deceased brother's avatar, a hybrid of human and native Na'vi DNA, giving him back control of his legs and freedom to roam the exotic vistas of the moon. At first his mission is to protect the scientists attempting to reestablish good relations with the ten-foot-tall blue natives of Pandora. However, he is separated from the group and brought to the Omaticaya, a clan of the Na'vi, and immersed in their culture. Over time, he comes to love their mother goddess Eywa and enjoy their peaceful existence... until that existence is threatened by the RDA Corporation, their military force led by Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang). Jake must now choose between his love for the beautiful Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) and the Na'vi, or the humans, who only want Pandora for its valuable Unobtanium.    The visuals are stunning. James Cameron managed to avoid the \\"uncanny valley\\" normally associated with CGI humanoids, and you feel for the characters... to a point. The semblance to any actual, thought-provoking storytelling, unfortunately, ends here.    Traditional storytelling points (script, character depth and development, and so forth) all fall flat on their faces. Although the actors put on a fantastic show, the lack of actual conflict in the story makes it hard to connect to them. The visuals alone will have you mesmorized for weeks, but once thesparkle wears off, what's left for a film? Well, like with Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, the characters and conflict still snag you. With \\"Avatar\\", much of that is quickly lost. There's very little conflict in the long run. Sure, there's the conflict between the Na'vi and the RDA at the climax of the film, but that's about it.    Jake never has to sacrifice or give up anything to live the rest of his life in his Na'vi body on Pandora. Sure, he must \\"choose\\" between the one-dimensional, greedy humans or the peace-loving Na'vi, but there's nothing else to add to the conflict. He gets to walk and run, breathe fresh air, and live simply, all without a sense of remorse for what he has done. He saved a moon, only to condemn Earth, which is in the middle of a crisis and needs the rare Unobtanium to save itself. Does he regret his choice? Never. In fact, both times I went to see the film, I found it highly disturbing that he was mowing down humans left and right without regret. No regret for betraying his species. No regret for condemning his homeworld. Worse yet, we get no exploration, not even exposition, of Jake's brother. What was he like? Did Jake even miss him, or barely know him, or what? Minor details like this can put a twist on even the oldest story.    We aren't given a chance to feel any sympathy for the humans: they're portrayed as greedy, one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. Why is Quaritch the way he is - cold, calculating, and thirsty for Na'vi blood? No reasons are given. Earth's plight? We never hear about it. The dark side of any sentient being's nature? Nope, the Na'vi remain \\"noble savages\\" throughout. Jake getting any character development, losing anything important, going through grief, being at all disturbed, anything like that? Not a hint. We never see his Marine side explored.    This film had so much potential, but beyond the beautiful and eye-filling visuals, the film simply falls into another cliche storm. The two stars are for thevisuals and Zoe's performance as Neytiri; the other three stars have been shaved off for simple storytelling that could have been built on so much more.

B001PJRAUS|4.0|Die-hard, classic Austen fans will probably not love this little twisted tale.<br /><br />However, if you just love all things Austen, whether true to the authentic voice of Jane, or a complete departure from Austen's formula, you should at least rent this.<br /><br />Amanda Price, a rabid fan and Darcy-ruined modern Brit, discovers Elizabeth Bennett in her bathroom one morning. Lizzie shows Amanda the secret passageway and Amanda can't resist.<br /><br />Now, don't expect Pride and Prejudice. You won't get that. From the minute Amanda flashes (off screen) the Bennett sisters who inquire about the unique grooming habits of modern girls, to the thoroughly modernized Lizzie, the story veers far, far, far from the traditional storyline.<br /><br />But it is fun and cute and has a charm and romance of it's own.

I've already gotten many compliments on the appearance of the watch and it's been mistaken for much more expensive brands (Breitling and Rolex) by co-workers. It keeps great time and is very comfortable on the wrist. I would definitely make this purchase again!!!
B0025KVLV0|4.0|The story that \\"Let if Be\\" from 1970 was the last album the Beatles released, but in fact primarily recorded before \\"Abbey Road\\" from 1969, is well known to connoisseurs of the group.<br /><br />The idea behind thge \\"Let It Be\\" project was to create a sort of documentary on how the group worked in the studio. Various circumstances meant that the album was partially shelved, and only finalized after \\"Abbey Road\\", now with Phil Spector as the man to do this. Specter went through countless hours of recordings to create want would the album \\"Let it Be\\". During this proces, he did quite a lot of overdubbing.<br /><br />Spector has subsequently been criticized by many for having over-produced the album, and some believe that some numbers, more or less have been ruined in this proces. Personally, I disagree with those views. Actually, my only major complaint is that one of the strongest tracks from those sessions was not even included on the album. How could it be that Lennon's \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was not chosen for the album? For me, there are at least three good reasons for this should have been done. 1: The number clearly comes from these sessions - see the Apple rooftop concert!!  2: The album's playing time is quite short, so even for this reason alone, it would have been a good idea to include it. 3: The most important reason of course is that song is among the very best from these sessions. Generally several of the tracks are not of the well-known high standards of the Beatles.<br /><br />The album has subsequently gone down in history as the group's least interesting, a fact which at first may seem surprising ; after all it does contain three number one single hits ( \\"Get Back\\", \\"Let it Be\\" and \\"The Long and Winding Road\\"). The problem with the album is that there are too many numbers that would normally have ended out as outtakes; possibly as b-sides. Harrison's \\"For You Blue\\" is very sweet but does sound like a serious bid for an album track. Or what about \\"One After 909\\" - an old song from the early Beatles days. Even very fine keyboard playing by Billy Preston can not change that the number is basically not very interesting.<br /><br />\\"Dig a Pony\\" - has fine features, but I've always felt that that guitar theme was something heavy rump. \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig it\\" are probably primarily included to give an impression of moods during these sessions - but the tracks more or less come out as unnecessary filler.<br /><br />However, there are also absolutely great songs. \\"Across the Universe\\", which actually comes from a charity album from 1968, is one of the highlights of the album. Spector deserves great praise for his work with this number, which here is presented infinitely stronger than the original version with off-key female voices on the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Two of Us\\" is a true Lennon-McCartney collaboration. An easy-going optimistic number that definitely too is among the best on the album.<br /><br />Harrison's \\"I Me Mine\\" was actually the very last song the group worked with - a relatively short number that Spector got clipped together so playing time reached two and a half minutes. An excellent number.<br /><br />\\"Let if Be\\" is simply McCartney at his best - another classic. \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" is also a good number. Really nice guitar riff, a nice tune - particularly exciting to hear McCartney and Lennon each their melody towards the end. Unfortunately I feel that McCartney's vocals at times sound sound rather strained, giving the song a somewhat uneven appearance.<br /><br />McCartney has expressed dissatisfaction with the Spector's treatment of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\". This was one of the reasons that the CD \\"Let It Be Naked\\" was released in 2003. I must say that I think Spector was right in his assessment of the number;  it is a \\"Disney-number\\" - with or without strings. I'm not crazy about the song, but I clearly prefer Spector's version.<br /><br />The closing song \\"Get Back\\" had already been released long before, and it is of course another highlight of the record - again, a damn shame that its -b-side \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was not chosen, as well. Actually I feel, considering that the album was already more or less a mixed bag, that the single \\"Ballad of John and Yoko\\" and perhaps even the B-side \\"Old Brown Shoe\\" should have been included.<br /><br />With these three additions, the album might have approached  5 stars - as it is now, it can barely achieve four stars.a damn shame that its -b-side \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" was not chosen, as well.

One solo excursion with Chester on the drums reminds the listener of the glory days of Genesis.

Overall I like it, considering that many parts of the books are absents, but what you can do in so short movie time... Anyway, I think the best of this DVD is the special features. My daughter and I enjoyed all the presentations made by the Harry Potter movie young actors and actress as well as the one hour with Rowling. These really gave you value to your money.
0385532458|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the book only problem is it was too short. Plenty of things to reflect on of what is truly important. And some great escapism at least for me. i could have sworn I lived a little part of some of the stories. Also I am a fellow Mississippian and have been a fan for a long time. In fact I started reading again for pleasure after overhearing 2 guys at the airport discussing \\"The Firm\\" way back when it came out.  Big fan of Amazon too.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Perhaps because I watched this film without expectations, I was floored by everything about it, from the magical innocence of child actor Catinca Untaru to the lush imagery of imagination.  Set in the 1920s in southern California, the film follows the relationship between Alexandria, a girl in the hospital with a broken arm, and Roy, a severely injured stuntman.  Alexandria, a immigrant child whose first language is not English, roams the hospital largely unattended, visiting other patients and nurses.  When she meets Roy, she settles on him as a father figure (her own is deceased), but Roy, consumed by despair over lost love and the possibility that he will never walk, has plans for her.  As he spins a story to keep Alexandria entertained, he plots a way to use her for his own goals.<br /><br />Told from Alexandria's perspective as it takes shape in her imagination, Roy's story is hilarious at times but also emotional as the two edit it to reflect their changing feelings about each other.  Characters in \\"real life\\" become characters in the story, a la The Wizard of Oz.  The duo's imagination leads to the darkest emotional place in this film, and when you emerge with the characters, you will be changed with them.  The pivot point is that gut-wrenching.<br /><br />Catinca Untaru is about adorable as a child actor can get without being cutesy; her portrayal feels as authentic as any skilled adult actor's.  Lee Pace's Roy is equally understated, with his despair peeking out from his otherwise normal interaction with Alexandria.  The Fall has been compared to Pan's Labyrinth, but this film is not that dark.  In fact, I tell people that is both heartbreaking and upbeat.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film.  With its beautiful cinematography, inventive storytelling, and acting, it never falters.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Having never played the game, I did not have a reference point and I was still blown away!!!  The graphics, attention to details....  WOW!!!  I have seen 3d animation before but never like this.  I find that I am unable to come up with adequate words to describe this movie.  So here goes....<br /><br />The CG dept and animators really balanced it by making it somewhat real but not too real so one could still see that it was still animation.....<br />The clothing on the characters moved with each step they took and if standing still in a windy area their gear would undulate on the breeze.  One can distinguish texture from knit, leather, and jean material.....WOAH!!!!!<br /><br />The fight scenes were out of this world!!!  Those motorcycles ridden by the main characters were crazy!!!!  Kind've  reminded me of the motorcycle in the Dark Knight but over the top without looking ridiculous.  The weapons,  in particular, that sword of Cloud's... INSANE!<br /><br />For the most part, anyone who sees this movie will be impressed!<br /><br />Highly recommend!!!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I was a bit afraid of this book when I purchased it for my kindle but it was so much better than I was expecting.  I read a review that said they bought this book for their daughter...and that she had lost a sister in a similar incident and that she thought the book was wonderful.  I do not like to read crime books or horror or gore...this was none of those.  I think the message of this book is a very important one and actually it could be a very healing book for someone who lost a loved one.  It was a very pleasant surprise and a wonderful book!
B001NEK2GE|4.0|I have to admit, at first it was a little difficult getting used to using the Logitech G13 Advanced Gameboard, as I had never used anything besides my plain keyboard for online gaming. Setup for the unit was fairly simple, and after a couple bumps in the road I had everything ready for use within about an hour. First few uses were really rather uncomfortable and awkward, but with more use it's becoming alot easier. Absolutely love the macroing capabilities, and the design is pretty slick (especially with the backlit LED). Overall, this was a nice first step into the world of gaming keyboards. Four stars, simply because it's not an absolute must-have, even for the hardcore gamers out there. A regular old keyboard still does the trick, but if you want to simplify your gaming a little with style, this is highly recommended.

Other than that the battery life is great and the ergonomics are fine.<br /><br />Edit: I've dropped my review from 5 to 4 stars because I've notice in games where you need to use the R1 and L1 buttons alot it causes my hand to hurt between the middle and index fingers.

The one thing the chefs on those competition shows always yell about is to READ the recipe the whole way through before you ever start, and that works here as well.<br /><br />I have to say, I've never made gravy of any kind from scratch.  That was something Mom did, and I was happy with packets and water. Ugh.  Last night, I consulted my Mastering book and followed Julia's directions to the T.  I bounced around when I realized that on my first try, I had created a perfect, delicious, COMPLETELY SMOOTH B&eacute;chamel sauce for my chicken thighs.  I can't wait to go through the rest of the book.  I will have to adapt some things, as I won't eat things like veal or liver.  But!  It works!  It's worth it's weight in gold!
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie, I felt like I was watching this at the theater. Except for the ocean scenes of course. I loved the fact that I could sing along and I actually remembered the words.Great actors. Such a fun movie.Made me feel exhilerated & alive.  I was very excited & will watch over and over again.
020161622X|5.0|I have used this book for two book studies with teams mixed with developers and QA. It stimulates great conversations and has memorable examples that come up in meetings years later.  It is a fun and easy read.  I recommend it highly.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This movie is sad and happy. I feel that every family should see this movie. I'm been thing what would be if William Wilberforce was still here on Earth, What would the world look like now with William Wilberforce. There is also a Bible study guide on the DVD. Can't wait until I can watch it again. It is too much to take in after seeing the whole movie.

B002MW50KO|4.0|Well, it is Bob and that makes it seem like a nice familiar Christmas album. HOwever, don't expect any creative twists on the classics. This is a bit like the washed up rocker in Love Actually doing a Christmas album. We play it and it fits the holiday bill, but it certainly doesn't compete with some of his other albums in terms of musical creativity.
B00005AFMT|5.0|From experience I observe that there are two broad ways that people hear this album. One, as a pounding, discordant, screeching annoyance that reeks of geek-hood. Two, as an example of truly inspired composition and musicianship. If you like counterpoint you will be captivated by this recording. You may even find yourself wondering if the Krimsons didn't spend some time listening to Bach. The way that the guitar parts weave in and out of one another is mesmerizing in a way that \\"ambient\\" music (I'm talking about that charlatan Brian Eno and the like) is not. The title track is one of the best \\"rock\\" guitar pieces ever written, hands down. To see them play it live (YouTube) is inspiring.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this show so much and the first season is awesome I'm so excited I was finally able to see it all the way through.

B002NOAF9W|4.0|Back in 1969, the Rolling Stones came back to America for the first time in several years. Following a rather lack-luster year for the Stones in 1967 with a few not-so-popular albums, they came back in full stride with the release of Beggars Banquest in '68, getting back to their roots. But in 1969, Brian Jones, the group's founder, was dead. Mick Taylor was replacing him. The Stones had just released a new album a few weeks before the Madison Square Garden performance, Let it Bleed. Though it was a new album, the Stones were filling their setlists with many new songs (Midnight Rambler, Live With Me, Love in Vain, Gimme Shelter), more than previous tours. Despite the death of the founder, a replacement, and playing new material released 2 weeks before, their gamble paid off, the crowd loved it. On Midnight Rambler, durring the slow part, you can hear Jagger sing \\"...Well you heard about the Boston...\\" followed by Keith slashing his guitar, and shouts from the crowd including one person yelling out an enthusiastic \\"G#d d###!\\"<br /><br />When the idea of a live album came to be, the Rolling Stones wanted the album to be a double LP. They wanted to not only include selections of songs from their set, they wanted to include their opening acts (BB King, Ike & Tina Turner) in the Double LP set, like a rock/r&b festival. However, after months of negotiations with the other artists' contract labels, the idea fell apart. But we still got the Greatest Rock and Roll Band releasing their greatest live album, Get Yer Ya Ya's Out!<br /><br />I bought my first copy of GYYYO about 10 years ago. I've listened to it so much that I've probably replaced the copy about 3 or 4 times because of wearing it out. The last time I replaced it, was when Abcko re-released all the Stones cd's into SACD format. I was enjoying it until it got to Stray Cat Blues when all of the sudden, the intro was cut down from the original to one measure instead of two. Hey I love the Stones, maybe more like addicted. When that intro was cut in half, I was pissed! I'm glad to say that the 40th Anniversary has brought it back to full length. I was hoping that Sympathy for the Devil would also be restored to it's full live version, as the original LP version cut out the last verse, but was dissapointed to hear the original album version.<br /><br />The 40th Ann. doesn't sound as it has been \\"remastered\\" greatly (in fact, it sounds just about the same), except when it comes to Street Fightin' Man. It sounds as if Keith's amp on the original release was set to 8, but on this remastered version it's set to friggin' 11! The tone is beautiful. The remastered version of Street Fightin' Man, with Keith's guitar turned up, makes the closing song that much stronger and rocking. Good call, Abcko.<br /><br />Then we get to the Unreleased Bonus tracks. To me, after listening several hundred times over, GYYYO sounds too polished or practiced compared to the bonus tracks. The bonus tracks are raunchy. I've heard most of them on bootlegs, but the sound quality is far more superior on this release. Definately love the acoustic blues of Prodigal Son and You Got To Move (both are different versions than what's on the DVD). Keith is in fine form on Under My Thumb, bringing new life to the song making it more sleazy than the original. The medely into I'm Free flows nicely. I have heard bootlegs of Mick Taylor playing a much better lead-guitar role on that song at other venues though.<br /><br />Now we get to Satisfaction (which is different than the dvd version). Why the Stones never released this version previously boggles the mind. I have over 200+ live bootlegs of the Rolling Stones. I often skip over Satisfaction as most of the hard-core fans have heard enough of it live. This version however, I would have paid the cost of the box set just for this song. Keith plays the main riff in a different octave, Jagger puts new passion into his vocals, and Mick Taylor shows that he is the \\"enhancement\\" player. He takes a great song, and makes it better with his lead guitar. His guitar playing on this song is spectacular. While he is playing the solo, listen to Keith play a slightly different rythym to the main riff and how little Mick adjusts his playing. The minute and a half after the last chorus of the main riff flies too fast as you hear Taylor playing an alternate but similar main riff with Richards playing the main riff anyway he can find how. I can't express how much I love this version.<br /><br />As for the opening acts. I'm not a big fan of Ike & Tina Turner. They performed well though, I was unhappy however that Gimme Some Lovin' was only an instrumental. I love BB King, but I thought his set lacked passion. I've definately heard better from the King.<br /><br />The DVD was interesting. Love the live shots of Prodigal Son and You Got To Move. I thought the album cover photo shoots were funny. The behind the scenes photage was ok, but would have loved to actually hear the conversation between Keith Richards and Jimi Hendrix. Under My Thumb was shot mostly with unrelated slow-motion video of an unrelated song. The Satisfaction video (different from cd version) was ok as parts of it showed how people were standing on their cushioned chairs, showing how much the people were getting into it. As far as the band is show though, you only see their rear ends, not the intricate fingering of Mick Taylor playing lead, not the slashing riffs of Keith Richards, mainly just the a## of Mick Jagger.<br /><br />When rating this box set, I only rated the original release, and the 5 extras. Having the full intro of Stray Cat Blues was a huge plus, as was the amplified guitar of Keith on Street Fightin' Man. The Bonus Tracks were friggin' awesome (dear Rolling Stones: HINT: Release more soundboards you have!!!!!!), but I was still unhappy that Sympathy for the Devil is still edited. I would have given it a 5 if it weren't. I wanted to give it a 4 1/2 stars but amazon won't let me so I gave it a 4. Buy this re-release and you will definately be entertained, even if you have listened to this live album a few thousand times like myself!akes it better with his lead guitar. His guitar playing on this song is spectacular. While he is playing the solo, listen to Keith play a slightly different rythym to the main riff and how little Mick adjusts his playing.

B00005NTJK|5.0|The early efforts by Ian Anderson<br />and his mates are marked by a fusion of<br />jazz, blues, rock, classical and celtic influences.<br />Odd meters made to feel straight, mixed with classical<br />melodies, jazz feels and hard rockin' blues (with a flute)make these early albums true fusion music before the term was even coined.<br />This pre-Aqua Lung era holds a much more eclectic mix of styles<br />and genres. Not to criticize the later efforts but Benefit and Stand Up are<br />my favorites due to the fusing of so many styles and use of odd meter.<br />With high caliber players even by today's standards, Tull<br />takes you on a trip and brings you back.<br />Ian Anderson is a true musical genius and succeeds<br />in fusing these styles in an accessible and even<br />commercially viable way.  I call it brilliant<br />and timeless.  It does not sound old or dated and<br />has a mysterious and engaging quality ranging from<br />beautiful haunting melodies to jazz inflected hard rocking and swinging grooves. I was also reminded what a talented vocalist Ian Anderson truly is.<br />Mixing flute with hard rock is in itself an innovation that should be recognized. True progressive British rock with depth and substance.<br />Modern music could do well to take a page from the Tull songbook.
0060254920|5.0|I have a 9 month old and am collecting classic story books for her to enjoy.  I love reading it to her, but I can't wait to hear her read it for herself!  This book should be in every childs collection.
B000P46QIG|1.0|Hey I understand that most rock musicians see hearing loss as a badge of honour, and want their gigs 2 dB away from ear drum perforation, so I suppose they might not know just how bad this cd sounds.  But if you have normal hearing and are under 90 you'll probably think your stereo is broken when you put this disc on.  The only other rock disc that sounds worse that I've heard is the '97 remaster of Iggy & the Stooges' Raw Power.<br /><br />For those that don't know, this cd is the product of the so called \\"Loudness War\\", you can Google that term for more info.  In a nutshell, what that is is the attempt by the mastering guy (although sometimes the mixer and the recording engineer as well) to jam as much signal as possible onto the recording medium.  How they do this is they make the loud parts quieter so that everything is one volume.  Then they can amplify that volume to the maximum.  That is why a cd from the 80's is approx 1/2 the volume of one from the 00's.<br /><br />They make the louder parts quieter by digital manipulation, and when it its taken too far you get digital distortion, clipping, and zero dynamics.  The end result is loss of audio information, degradation of the sound, and the removal of any dynamics.  And dynamics are important, it is a vital part of how we express emotion through sound.  Mozart believed a singers ability to modulate volume within a single note and between groups of notes was so important it was the first thing he looked for when evaluating talent.  He saw it as a vital means of communication and a vital part of the power and emotionality of music. (you can read more about Mozart's thoughts in a book called \\"Mozart Speaks\\", which collects some of his letters).<br /><br />Anyway, this cd has clipped waves galore, approx 4 dB of dynamic range, and will induce listener fatigue in a matter of minutes.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I don't know what it is but there's something about Susan Boyles voice that just brings peace and tranquility to my soul when I hear it. The music on this album is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful to list too. Thank you, Susan, for showing up at that first audition.
1400052173|5.0|When Henrietta Lacks died of cervical cancer in 1951, she left behind a husband, five children, and a small clutch of cells, harvested from her body without her knowledge or permission, that would achieve immortality and the status of medical legend.  Chances are, you, or someone you know and love, have benefited from research conducted on Henrietta's cells, dubbed HeLa, by the medical community.<br /><br />In this eminently readable book, Rebecca Skloot traces the story of Henrietta and her family alongside that of the HeLa cells.  While the Lacks family has suffered, mired in poverty and ill-health, the HeLa line of cells have thrived, and had a role to play in just about every major medical development of the late 20th century.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot does not shy away from pointing out the irony that Henrietta's own children and grandchildren do not have access to the advanced quality of care made possible by the very cells taken from their matriarch.  She also explains the science in very easy to understand terms that even the most scientifically illiterate person (that would be me!) can grasp.<br /><br />Come the end of this year, this book should be appearing on a lot of \\"Best of\\" lists, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was a serious contender for nonfiction literary prizes.<br /><br />And as for Henrietta Lacks herself?  Well, there ought to be a statue of this woman on the grounds of Johns Hopkins Hospital.  She has probably saved millions of lives, and she will probably save millions more.

B002V9PEU4|4.0|Hi Folks,  this is a review of the BLU-RAY edition. This movie was a bit of a financial failure I  believe in its release but I enjoyed it for a fun/dumb action flick!    I actually have the regular DVD edition from the UK which as  1)theatrical trailer  2)a featurette  3) music video featuring AC/DC and Arnold    all fun bonus features and NOT  on the Blu-Ray?    I've deducted a star for the fact that they've delivered a 'bare bones' Blu-ray and besides the ability to carry higher resolution one of the benefits of Blu-Ray is the bigger storage so there is not excuse for having elminated bonus features already produced?    and the Blu-ray on this isn't substantially better than the regular edition to my eyes..I can't recommend an upgrade for the money.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|What else needs to be said? This story was lovely. Beautifully written and with well developed characters. Feels weird pointing this out but Stiefvater always has such nice covers on her books. Can't wait to read the next in the series.
B002MW50KO|4.0|I got this CD for my wife, who's a great Dylan fan and she really liked it.  I heard it from the other room, and well, it sounded like Bob Dylan to me, if you know what I mean.  But as I said, she liked it which was the whole idea.  :)
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like many others, when I first heard Susan Boyle sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" (the youtube video) I was pretty amazed;  But, it got better; I ordered her CD and when I received it just could not stop playing it.  Her voice to me is just magical.  I especially love her rendition of \\"Wild Horses\\"......I am so happy she has finally been 'discovered' - better late than never.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The box art is great, and it came in pristine condition.  All DVDs were present in the box and have greatly enjoyed this series.  It really is a great addition to anyones DVD collection and is something you can enjoy not only for the great pictures, but the quality of the filming.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I wasn't sure what to make of the direction of 21st-century rock until I discovered these guys.  I mean, life was okay with Jimmy Eat World and Coldplay, but those bands have a bit of a sanitized sound.  The Kings of Leon, however, have a gritty, gravelly sound, actually know how to play a variety of instruments and can produce an album with three or more songs you might want to hear more than once.  U2 might be able to hand the pop-rock baton over to these gents.  \\"Closer,\\" \\"Crawl,\\" \\"Sex on Fire,\\" \\"Use Somebody,\\" \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Be Somebody\\" are all good to great songs, with \\"Revelry,\\" \\"Notion,\\" \\"17,\\" \\"Cold Desert\\" and \\"Frontier City\\" ringing in as \\"okay.\\"  \\"I Want You\\" has WAY too much cowbell (MORE COWBELL!).  Kings of Leon is a refreshing addition to the rock world.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|Picture quality is greatly improved over the original release.  The added commentaries and comments are of great interest to Hitchcock fans.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This book is proof you cannot rush creativity.  I'll blame the contract forced upon an art form. The concept was great, the writing lacked a true novel length storyline and any passion we read within the previous books
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I was very pleased with this product.  It was in new condition, and worked right from the start.  I had not seen this movie before purchase, but had received good reviews from friends and on-line sources.  The movie itself is exceptional and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who would like to try something different.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|This fine western is more like the classics such as 'Shane' from the 40's and 50's, when the genre reached its artistic peak, than the ultra-violent post-Wild Bunch school. This is a refreshing and welcome change of pace. The progressive increase in violence, misogyny and sadism since the 1960's, although yielding some admitted classics such as 'Unforgiven,' is an ultimately an artistic dead end.<br /><br />'Appaloosa' is a western that contains interesting and plausible characters, some of whom you will identify with, struggling with the human condition in various aspects, as the plot unfolds in an interesting manner. There are some good gun fights, there is horseback riding, there is wonderful scenery, excellent photography, and fine acting.<br /><br />This movie is paced more like the classic westerns than today's action movies, where someone gets tortured, killed, or blowed up about every 2 minutes because the director thinks all the 14 year old ADHD boys in the theater will go to sleep if he does otherwise. In my opinion, this is a great improvement over the recent '3:10 to Yuma,' which was too oppressively hyperactive and stupid for someone over 30 to enjoy.<br /><br />My wife, who is not nearly as keen on westerns as am I, enjoyed this movie almost as much as I did. As a fan of westerns, I give this movie an extra star because there are so few good westerns made anymore. A person not interested in westerns would probably give this a 4.<br /><br />Nonetheless, this is a very good movie for adults who like good movies, and a real treat for fans of classic westerns.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show has brought me back to network television. For years I have watched DVD's and programs on HBO and SHOWTIME. For some reason I just drifted away from the old networks, but MODERN FAMILY has brought me back and now I also enjoy THE MIDDLE and COUGAR TOWN. This show leaves me feeling good along with great laughs. Ed O'Neal is great! Ty Burrell is good too as a bumbling husband who wants so badly to be the popular dad to the chagrin of his wife (who is adorable). Everyone should give this show a chance.
B002XTBEDI|2.0|I was thoroughly enchanted by the original Cranford and, therefore, filled with happy anticipation for the sequel.  What a disappointment it is:  ridiculous plot lines, poor writing, choppy pacing, sloppy editing.  It contains none of the substance or subtlety of the original and little of it's charm.  The actors are the only pleasure yet they are given precious little to do...a waste of some considerable talent.  While I can watch Cranford over and over (and have!), once was enough for the sequel.  I couldn't help but feel cheated, I'm sorry to say.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|After reading the early reviews on the BK2 I bought one. It was my baby until my brother who is overseas asked for it ( Drat ). So naturally being the big brother, I handed it over to him (with a few minor whimpers). Then I bought another one and an old friend of mine took a shine to it. Guess what? Yep, that's two of them gone.  Now my plan is buy two so that I have at least one to fall back on. Everyone's going on about how great the BK2 is. It is that and more, but here's a biting criticism of the knife. I just can't seem to hold onto mine! It's that good. I've been pining for a survival / camping / hunting knife for over two years until I saw the BK2. It's an unbelievable knife. Both mine came hair shaving sharp at an extremely reasonable price; and best of all it's made in The U.S.A.   Ka-Bar and Becker could teach a few things to those who send our jobs overseas.
1400023343|5.0|As other readers have already noted, Barbara Zurer Pearson's book is much more than a simple how-to guide. Rather, Zurer Pearson brings her ample experience as a linguist specialized in bilingualism and her broad knowledge of the literature in the field to her book to present a comprehensive introduction to both the issues surrounding bilingualism and children and the different methods parents can use to achieve it. Her writing style is fun and easy to read even when referencing technical studies, and she breaks down the findings in an engaging way for experts and laypeople alike.     The book begins with a general discussion of bilingualism, in which Zurer Pearson offers compelling, research-grounded arguments for the wealth of benefits of growing up bi- or multilingual. In addition to references to the literature on such things as bilingualism's effect on wider language abilities, mental flexibility, etc., arguments include personal accounts from parents and people who grew up bilingual themselves. It continues with an enlightening exploration of the language-acquisition process, in terms of both the biology involved (how do our brains work) and environmental factors (exposure to languages, etc.). Chapter 4 addresses how to establish a bilingual environment for your child, based on your goals, resources, etc. To this end, it identifies the key factors (e.g., exposure, attitude, etc.) and introduces the four major strategies that families most often use. It moreover includes a helpful section in the form of answers to common questions that parents who aspire to raise their children bilingually might have, as well as a short trouble-shooting section for parents whose kids need extra encouragement to use their second (or third) languages. Chapter 5 offers a wide variety of case studies (36!) of families that have pursued different methods (from classic \\"one parent, one language\\" approaches to cases of parents who do not speak the second language they wish to teach natively and even cases of families seeking to give their children a trilingual upbringing). This is particularly helpful, as each family's situation is different and no single strategy is \\"best\\" in every case. The case studies thus offer a helpful window onto efforts that have met with varying degrees of success, which families can use as additional tales of triumph or caution to fine-tune their own individualized strategies at home. The book concludes with sections on possible language impairments, research comparing monolinguals and bilinguals, and bilingual identity, as well as a list of helpful resources for anyone interested in additional information. There is likewise an extensive reference section at the end for further reading.     In short, this is an excellent book for parents interested in the exciting challenge of bringing up their children bi- or multilingually, particularly those who do not have the privilege of living in bi- or multilingual societies.
B00006I53S|4.0|Quiet, fast focus, excellent image quality and IS is useful in low light conditions (I recommend IS, its really helpful)    but    heavy, so it zooms-out on its own when hanging over shoulder. Vary annoying, I'm using something like sock to prevent this.    Overall this is great lens for every day photography and money.
0810982862|4.0|What's there is quite good -- lots of nice color pictures evenly split between the machinery and Pandora, and some interesting tidbits about how some things were designed (like the Hallelujah Mountains)but, for the most part, the supporting commentary was really weak.      There were 6 pages of photos of the 'flora' but NO DESCRIPTION on a single one.  There were also teaser comments, like the fact that \\"even the buttons on the uniforms were specially designed\\", but then NO follow up on what they looked like or why they were designed that way.  Photo are fine, necessary, but I want to know the thought process behind the end result.      As another reviewer mentioned, it seems as though the book was rushed to production.

0316069906|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for many years but still found this book to be very powerful and have learned a lot about the process involved in factory farming. I have also bought this book for family members and friends because I think it is critical that we educate ourselves and others on what we eat and where it comes from. I have read most of Michael Pollan's books and enjoyed them but feel this gives a deeper explanation into the actual industry and the ways in which animals are treated/mistreated by factory farms. I recommend it to meat eaters as well as vegetarians and vegans.
0385523904|5.0|One of the last truly closed societies, North Korea is exposed through the eyes of six North Korean defectors. The author is adept at masterfully telling the tales of these people rendering them with a novelistic clarity.    And this is a cliche, but here goes -- I couldn't put this book down.    The compelling issues for me were not merely the sacrifices, the totalitarian oppression, the lack of food, the grimness, but the propaganda that North Korea beams into the heads of the citizens. What is particularly interesting is how each of the \\"characters\\" in this book came to realize the extent to which the Dear Leader had peddled lies and deceptions. And the characters' realizations that their own country, not some outside boogeyman, was the evil force was brilliantly handled!    Ultimately, these depressing lives have more to say about the strength of the human spirit than about the details of being malnourished.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I am an unashamed \\"Trekky\\", so naturally I purchased this DVD. It is THE BEST movie of the bunch!!! My husband and I have watched it 3 times so far and it only gets better!!!!! This film is action, action, action. The actors chosen do a FABULOUS job of convincing the audience that they are the younger versions of all the main cast members of the original T.V. serial. A must have DVD for Star Trek fans and a great DVD for just plain adventure viewers.
0345479092|1.0|This book looked promising but didn't really deliver. The author is condescending and I could not stand how she kept calling the reader \\"luv\\", it was very off-putting. While I feel strongly that a middle of the road approach like hers is the best way to go, I really did not like how she labeled different types of babies. By dividing babies into categories, she'll call one type \\"Angels\\" and another type \\"Touchy\\" or even \\"Grumpy\\", and that is quite the value judgment there. I don't think labeling babies is a good way to start them in life, it really unconsciously  affects your attitudes towards them, and as a parent that's really not what you want. And if you are going to categorize and label babies, I don't think so few categories exist, and her advice is useless if your baby doesn't fit neatly into one category. She briefly mentions that babies often are combinations of categories and that you should blend her advice to fit the baby but she completely fails to explain HOW to do that. She's also very boastful. It's good to be confident, but she comes across as too self-promoting.    Skip this book.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles recorded at a time when engineers were experimenting with stereo, and although i enjoy the effects they came up with, it's not a \\"realistic\\" sound that we are accustomed to today.   It  was also the custom of the day to under-record the bass.  The remastering of their recordings is brilliant.    I bought Sgt. Peppers and Abbey Rd.   Now I want them all.  It breaths new life into the music of the most incredible band in the history of popular music.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|While Coldplay's previous effort, [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]], succeeded by cranking the dial up on the band's unique brand of brit-pop, it lacked the heart and soul of both [[ASIN:B0000508U6 Parachutes]] and [[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]]. With the band's fourth effort, \\"Viva La Vida,\\" though, the band rolls up their sleeves,  gets creative and inspired and with the help of legendary producer Brian Eno (U2, Talking Heads) turn out one of the most interesting and unique pop/rock albums in its time at a point where perhaps nobody expected them to.<br /><br />Not merely sticking to one genre, \\"Viva La Vida\\" liberates Coldplay from the somewhat droning nature of the previous album, with previously uncharted waters being explored. Witness \\"Lost!\\" which perfectly blends the stadium-rock appeal of the band's greatest hits with a hip-hop flavor, making it a comeback anthem of sorts. On a similar note, the title track proudly proclaims \\"The old king is dead/long live the king,\\" perhaps alluding to the band's renewed fire and maturity. Elsewhere, the band experiments with some avant-garde compositions and well-placed tribal elements while still maintaining their appeal and churning out one memorable song after another. Despite all of the experimentation and left-turns the band takes, at no point do they lose their identity or forget about the quality of their craft. Rest assured that this is still a Coldplay album, but of a different nature.<br /><br />On the bulk of the album, Chris Martin and company sound hungrier than ever before, like they have something to prove and in turn, have churned out a massive masterpiece that manages to up-the-ante and virtually outshine their previous efforts. It's a joy to see fame hasn't spoiled the band or hindered their inspiration, and things can only go up from here. \\"Viva La Vida\\" is simply a wide-reaching and awe-inspiring affair that will satisfy even the most jaded music lover.

0684833395|5.0|By this time everyone knows what a Catch-22 is - we're inundated with them every day - but in case you're not sure, it's a circumstance in which the very thing you need in order to get you what you want is the very thing that will prevent you from getting it.  In short, it's a double bind.<br /><br />The first Catch-22 ever publicized is, of course, to be found in this book.  Yossarian, the protagonist and a World War II bombardier, wants his squadron doctor to certify him insane so his superiors will ground him and he won't have to fly combat missions.  The doctor agrees that Yossarian is crazy, for a variety of reasons.  All that's lacking is for Yossarian to ask to be grounded.  If he does that, however, the doctor is required to take that as a sign that he has a normal, healthy aversion to being shot at, that he is therefore sane, and that he must therefore fly more combat missions.  Oops.<br /><br />This is far from the first or last such incidence of utter lunacy in this book.  The chaos begins well before the story kicks off.  It actually starts at the author's note, which states that the real island of Pianosa lies in the Mediterranean off the Italian coast and is far too small to accommodate all the incidents set there in \\"Catch-22\\".  So you start reading, with the idea in mind that the story on paper is, if anything, less real than other books, and the activities of the characters seem to bear you out - for instance, within the first few pages the narrative describes a captain with whom Yossarian has stopped playing chess because the captain is a good chess player, and the games are therefore so interesting they are foolish.  And you think \\"Aha, this is a farce\\".  Then Chapter 2 starts with the line \\"Outside, there was still nothing funny going on,\\" and you remember that Yossarian and his buddies are in imminent danger of death every day.  Farce, my foot.<br /><br />Joseph Heller had a real gift for the goofy detail - he could have written sketches for Monty Python - and it was a stroke of genius for him to set his first novel during World War II, because the pressures of wartime prevent the story from dissolving into a set of disconnected episodes.  The author came up with a few other strategies to lend his story a framework, most particularly Yossarian's recurring recollection of what happened in his plane to a young gunner named Snowden.  In speaking of this incident, he generally turns it into a bad joke, asking \\"Where are the Snowdens of yesteryear?\\" during mission briefings whenever someone asks if there are any questions.  The question is a riff on the refrain of a poem by the medieval French poet Villon - \\"Where are the snows of yesteryear?\\" - the verses of which seem to be about the loss of beauty and love, or maybe innocence.  As for Yossarian's question, when you find out what happened to Snowden, you learn that Yossarian isn't quite as nuts as you might think.  Let's just say that his question has to do with lost innocence also, and let it go at that.<br /><br />As a matter of fact, you can read all of \\"Catch-22\\" as a series of confrontations between innocence and whatever seeks to destroy it, another good reason for setting it in wartime.  This probably explains why there are so few combat scenes in the novel, and maybe why this is an air unit rather than a ground unit.  It allows Heller to tell his story at one remove from genuine blood and death, at least until the novel's climax, and concentrate on the conflict between the innocent and the cynical.  Yossarian makes a good central character because he's almost the only one who finds a way to fight the cynics around him without becoming cynical himself.  It doesn't work forever, but it keeps Yossarian out of the snake pit long enough to learn another strategy from a most unlikely supporting character, and that's how \\"Catch-22\\" manages to end in some sort of triumph.<br /><br />So that's one possible reading of this ridiculous story - ridiculous on its face, that is.  You can also read it as an attack on postwar bureaucracy a la Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", or some kind of anti-imperialist manifesto, or I don't know what, but please don't forget that it's also a comedy of manners, however unlikely that sounds.  And just to give you an idea of how lightly you can take this book, we know that the phrase \\"Catch-22\\" is pretty nearly random.  Joseph Heller wanted to call it \\"Catch-18\\", but his publisher made him change the number to avoid confusion with the contemporary bestseller \\"Mila 18\\", and he picked one that sounded euphonious to him.  That's how much heavy significance there is to this novel - first and foremost, it's meant to be funny, and it succeeds exceptionally well.<br /><br />Joseph Heller gave an interview once in which he envisioned Buck Henry, who wrote the movie screenplay, flipping through \\"Catch-22\\" in despair and moaning \\"There's no PLOT here!\\"  Technically speaking, that's probably true, but it doesn't matter.  Its structure and theme make this novel hang together more than well enough.  As we follow Yossarian from his desire to avoid combat by simply refusing to cooperate (following in the footsteps of his great predecessor, the Good Soldier Svejk), to his desperate attempt at keeping his sanity and his moral compass while tied hand and foot by the last great Catch-22, we come to realize that like a lot of light farces, this one has some pretty deep roots.  Evidently the little island of Pianosa, at least in Joseph Heller's imagination, is plenty big enough for a great tale.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, Sometimes goofing off is better than preaching sermons.n attack on postwar bureaucracy a la Kafka's \\"The Trial\\", or some kind of anti-imperialist manifesto, or I don't know what, but please don't forget that it's also a comedy of manners, however unlikely that sounds.

0307278255|3.0|having skimmed the reviews, it occurs to me that i think people have a difficult time making a distinction between a book that speaks to them and the actual writing style of an author. when i review a book i usually ask myself, have i seen this before, is the writing style interesting, and most of all was it worth the full jacket price?<br /><br />i read for entertainment and education. i like to let my dollar speak for me.<br /><br />i'm not a particular fan of her writing style. it seems to accentuate the inane too much.<br /><br />when that happens, i'm tempted to think there's a reason for it (a literary device at play); when it happens too often it becomes a \\"snore fest\\". one amazon reviewer says, \\"she tries to elicit an emotional response and it comes off as contrived\\" - and that about hits it just right.<br /><br />the author really goes out of the way to say something without saying anything. it happens on a consistent basis, nearly ever other paragraph. maybe that's a cultural reference or technique i'm missing out on, but it's frustrating to read.<br /><br />i think writing about the immigrant experience is a worthy literary venture. particularly social pressures for a first generation child (the first kid from another culture born in the US) from a particular ethnicity having to straddle the demands of non-native parents and with a native lifestyle.<br /><br />that theme is a bit over done - there are tons of books that cover this theme that do a better job. so, in some respects, the themes are predictable and a rehash of themes i've seen in other media.<br /><br />placing an accent on the specific cultural differences and demands of a Bengali in America is why i'm reading it. that is the value this book could add to the table. i think the praise for this book is a bit too high. we've all read this type of fare before and we've all seen it in movies.<br /><br />it's an alright read. over-hyped and a bit dry but, alright. not worth 15 dollars, more like 5.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|I finally broke down and got a PS3 after owning a 360 for over a year (and putting up with paying for xbox live).  I've always been unsure of how to hold a PS2/PSOne controller - do you use two fingers on the shoulder or just one?  And why are the R2/L2 buttons convex?  My fingers sometimes slip off...    If you're feeling slightly uncomfortable with the shoulder buttons on the controller, it's worth the $5 to try these clips.  My 21-year old hands feel a little big for them, but still fit comfortably on the controller.  The radius of the curve is relatively tighter than I anticipated, especially after playing with an xbox controller for a while.    Pros:  Decent quality plastic and good design  Looks natural, doesn't stick out too much  Easy to clip on and remove, doesn't feel like I'm scratching the built-in R2/L2 buttons    Cons:  Slight difference in texture and color, seem to get slightly slippery if at all sweaty  A little tight, seems to \\"hug\\" my big fingers- might be better suited to ergonomics of smaller hands

B002VPE1AW|5.0|Cameron's big theme is mortality and how to make our lives meaningful.   In the Terminator films he situates this theme in the relationship of man and machine.   In Titanic, he invests the machine with the dreams (and weaknesses) of man.   And now, in Avatar, he finds a new way of developing this theme:  the Avatars themselves are a hybrid of the the living and the (bio) mechanical.       A lot of people complain that the story line here feels too familiar.   So what?   Shakespeare recycled old plots.   Most westerners/police thrillers, etc do the same.  The point of the plot is to give a framework to the filmmaker in which to work his magic.    And, in Avatar, Cameron delivers some of the most extraordinary magic ever seen on this planet.   And though the world he shows us is alien, he shows it to us always with the aim of making us see our own world-- and our own flaws as a species-- more clearly.    Some have complained about the film's supposed critique of America.   Those people probably are the shallow and corrupted souls who have warped our country away from its best instincts.   What does environmental destruction, greed, and imperialism have to do with the dreams of the founding father's anyway?    And what kind of American would defend the destruction of the planet?   These knee-jerk reactions against the film are merely expressions of the depraved mindset of a certain paranoid sector of the right wing which has been getting a lot of attention lately but whose attacks of progressive ideas-- and science itself-- really only represent the ever present existence of barbarians in every society since the dawn of man.   Sarah Palin's recent comment that \\"it's arrogant for man to think he can influence nature\\" is one of the dumbest things ever uttered by an animal with two legs.  (No, I don't think she's human. I think she's an Avatar herself: of the devil.)      Avatar dreams of a utopia which defeats these barbarians-- and their political front men forever.Cameron has made the sci-fi dream which best represents the hopeful side of man.   All of us are lucky to be able to see a blockbuster as sincere, idealistic, imaginative, and brave as the film James Cameron has given us.
B002UZCJP2|4.0|Aside from the loads of critics out there that have found the hundreds of reasons this movie is poor to average, the overlaying entertainment value icon still exists in Willis - and in the end that is why I have people still asking for it (even though they have all heard how poorly this did). Judging from the low revenue in theaters I was afraid they were going to skimp on the BD, which essentially they did but overall it still provides some thrills for the Bruce fans.<br /><br />The Blu clarity is a mixed bag, with a few reference scenes during exterior landscapes. The interior and dialogue scenes are very mixed, with the night time effects shots looking somewhat fake to the heavy makeup/CGI faces looking worse than (I think) intended. Pause checking a variety of scenes showed some random artifact and grain, but once you watch the deleted scenes you will see how much clean-up work was done. The DTS gets some nice usage, with a spattering of action scenes, music and dialogue spread throughout the channels.

B002T9H2L0|3.0|When I saw this movie I was hoping for a group of men who did a exciting mission  to inflitrate the Nazi's in France in other words a decent commando movie.  Instead this was more of a fantasy in which all the top Nazi's get killed off in a movie theater.  And we really didn't get to see a fast moving story like 'where eagles dare' or even 'the dirty dozen\\" among the many other movies.  Ok , the top Nazi's deserved to die in theater blown to bits. They were complete monsters but it's not even close to what really happened in history.  So this movie becomes a revenge fantasy movie , which if it had a suspenseful buildup would have been easier for me to digest.  However I am biased in that I have a degree in history and believe that at a least a basic framework should be followed when making some movies.  I love Quentin Tarantinos work including the underrated \\"jackie brown\\" but this one just was flat for me. And that has nothing to do with history. It wasn't like we saw them go behind the lines against the odds and carry out any mission. Instead we see a psychotic slaughter of German soldiers with nothing leading up to it much.<br />These were even really bad germans either.  This was a major A movie so on that scale I would have to give it a 3 star rating in my book.  The blu ray looks great though and it's the only way to go if you want to own this movie.

B001UV4XUG|5.0|(500) Days of Summer was kind of a role reversal where the girl, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), is afraid of commitment and just wants a casual friendship, or at most, friends with benefits; while Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) thinks he has found his soul mate, the mythical woman he has been searching for 'The One.' Summer is super attractive, as a montage, early on, informs us. When she worked in an ice cream parlor, sales where up 12%, and whenever she rented an apt it was 12.5% below market value, because men and landlords of all ages could not resist her charms. She wasn't my cup of oolong, but I could see why Tom would fall for her. Could also see how dumb and foolish Tom was being. That was half the fun. You'd think his character would grate on your nerves, because he was such a crybaby, but Joseph Gordon-Levitt really pulled off that amazing tightrope walk. Maybe it was his sweater vests...<br /><br />This was a very modern comedy. It was an Annie Hall for the new millennium. Like Annie Hall, it used a variety of narrative techniques, one being a narrator who sounds like a sociologist, who tells us upfront that this is not a love story. Another was that before every scene there are numbers denoting which day in the 500-day relationship it is. Uh oh, I thought. That could soon grow tiresome. It wasn't bad, though, because they didn't show every single tedious day in sequence, but rather jumped back and forth.<br /><br />Though mostly the movie glided along, hewing fairly close to a realistic albeit exceedingly clever and well-written reality, sometimes it veered wildly away from the humdrum. For instance, there is a dance number that even includes an animated blue bird. This was a high point of the film, Believe It Or Not. It is funny that Elvis Costello, though he didn't claim to have made it up, once said that rock journalists, or writing about music, was like dancing about architecture. Well, this movie has Tom, a greeting card writer by trade, who has a dream deferred about being an architect. In a way (500) days of Summer is also like dancing about architecture, but in a good way. When Tom is asked why he gave up architecture for greeting cards, he responds thusly:<br /><br />--------<br />Tom: I guess I just figured, why make something disposable like a building when you can make something that lasts forever, like a greeting card.<br />============<br /><br />Sometimes Tom looks directly at the camera and all but winks--briefly breaching the Fourth Wall--but only if it is some truly amazing coincidence that verges on cosmic significance. Speaking of cosmic significance, there are several coincidences in this film that would indicate that the screenwriter has been reading my mail, or at the very least, that he has acquired my infinite playlist. All the music choices were uncanny, though I won't go into why that is so. Suffice it to say that \\"Sugar Town,\\" the song Summer chose to sing at karaoke, made famous by Nancy Sinatra, written for her by Lee Hazelwood, figures prominently in my own saga, as does virtually ever single song on the soundtrack. \\"Here Comes Your Man\\" by The Pixies, \\"Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want\\" and \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" by The Smiths, and \\"Train in Vain\\" by The Clash. Not quite as fraught with esoteric meaning, but still great musical choices were songs by Carla Bruni (First Lady of France, married to Nicolas Sarkosy), Patrick Swayze, Hall & Oates, Simon & Garfunkel, The Black Lips, Feist, & Regina Spektor. There are pop culture references galore, all on-target. Haven't seen the likes of it since Seinfeld brought his Pez Dispenser to that piano recital. Best Ikea reference since Fight Club. Tom is shown wearing not one, but two, Joy Division t-shirts!<br /><br />-----------------<br />Tom: Man, no. No jobs. I'm still unemployed. We - we kissed.<br />============<br /><br />Worthy of mention are Tom's support system consisting of Paul (Matthew Gray Gubler), who has been going out with his girl friend Robin since High School but gets a vicarious thrill from hearing about Tom's escapades; his little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz), who acts more like his big brother, giving him tough love and good advice which he mostly ignores; and McKinzie (Geoffrey Arend), who hasn't gone out with anyone since a brief fling in High School, who also gets a vicarious thrill out of hearing about Tom's escapades:<br /><br />---------------<br />McKinzie: Well, you know, Henry Miller said the best way to get over a woman is to turn her into literature<br />=====================<br /><br />Bottom line: (500) Days of Summer is a delightful post-modern romantic comedy romp with great performances by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and the delightful Zooey Deschanel. Though boy meets girl, he doesn't get girl, or at least he doesn't get to keep girl. Though Tom thinks that it is a tragedy, it was really a comedy, and one day he will look back and laugh. One suspects that, like Henry Miller, the screenwriters of (500) Days of Summer were getting over a woman by turning her into a great film, if not exactly into literature (not a judgment on their relative merits, merely acknowledging that they are different mediums).<br /><br />PS: Zooey Deschanel is a very talented singer with exquisite taste. Her favorite singer is Ella Fitzgerald. She is in a group with M. Ward, and also another cabaret group. In Elf, she sang \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside,\\" with Will Ferrell's elf. She is an interesting young lady who comes from a very hip family; in fact, she was named after a character in a J.D. Salinger novel.

One suspects that, like Henry Miller, the screenwriters of (500) Days of Summer were getting over a woman by turning her into a great film, if not exactly into literature (not a judgment on their relative merits, merely acknowledging that they are different mediums).

B002T9H2L0|2.0|Quentin Tarantino is all about the gimmick now. While PULP FICTION was an original, mazelike  movie with memorable characters and KILL BILL VOL.1 was the perfect grindhouse kung fu revenge film (modernized for today's audience), everything else he's done feels either half-baked, self-congratulatory, incomplete, or all of the above. I think that in most of his dialogue-driven films (JACKIE BROWN, KILL BILL VOL. 2, DEATH PROOF, and this film INGLORIOUS BASTERDS), Tarantino THINKS he knows how certain people talk. I know that it's supposed to be \\"his vision\\" and \\"just a movie\\", but there still has to be something for the audience to connect to as it's going on. In most of his films, I feel no connection. And that is definitely true of this film INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS.    INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS gets off to a promising start introducing us to the despicable Jew Hunter Colonel Hans Landa (played brilliantly by Oscar frontrunner Christoph Waltz) and his interrogation of a French farmer. This tense scene effectively touches upon the evil that was Nazism, especially it's conclusion. Then, the movie falls apart immediately with, ironically, the introduction of the title characters! The Basterd unit, led by Brad Pitt (in a seriocomic role playing Sgt. Aldo Raine) are too distant to the viewer and we get absolutely no handle on what any of them is about, except for perhaps Hugo Stiglitz, but even his intro and backstory is muzzled by Tarantino's self-congratulation by using out-of-place elements from his other films (odd 70s-style subtitles and narration).     There's been a lot of buzz about a second scene in a basement of a Paris bar where a showdown between some of the Basterds and German soldiers occurs. It's a well executed scene, but drags on for way too long and is really devoid of any of the depth or provocation that Tarantino displayed in similarly long scenes in PULP FICTION. The whole time this scene was going on, I was like, \\"What's the point?!\\" And after the climax ofthe scene, we are left with one surviving character (the most annoying of the scene) that we are supposed to empathize with, but all his droning and whining just makes me glad of what actually happened to him. I wish more characters in this were treated to a fitting end to get them out of this mess of a film.      The most interesting characters are the two main females French-Jewish refugee Shosanna Dreyfuss (heartbreaking Melainie Laurent, whose character is the core of the film) and crafty double-agent German actress Bridget von Hammersmark (sexy Diane Kruger, the second best character in the film behind Hans Landa). While INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS certainly has some good characters in it in addition to the aforementioned ones, they are all trapped in a rather messy film with too much dialogue and in scenes that go absolutely nowhere. Tarantino really lets loose with his histrionics and weirdness in the painfully dull, long, tedious final act.    While the odd, over-the-top final act (with a tacked-on ending) is my biggest complaint with the film, the film overall feels very disconnected and incomplete; the viewer can't connect with the characters due to the overemphasis on talking; they all feel like set pieces, rather than real people. Tarantino has good ideas and executes SOME of them well (esp. the opening scene, which actually has some depth and believability), but steps on his own toes so much that he ends up screwing up his own film. With 70s title threads, jive-talking narrators, music stolen from his previous films (which he already stole from other films!), an idiotic interpretation of Hitler and his falling regime, and even the equivalent of an 80s music video, INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS plays like one of Tarantino's dreams (or nightmares if you prefer).
B000002J09|1.0|When I was little I loved Led Zeppelin, anytime they came on the radio I had my dad turn the volume up to an absurd level; this lasted from about age 4 to about 12, but kids are pretty painfully stupid, so, I had that as an excuse.<br /><br />But now I'm 25 and my tastes have been fine tuned, honed to near dead on perfection, and I cannot for the life of me enjoy a single Led Zeppelin song save for ONE song, AND its an instrumental (Moby Dick).<br /><br />Other than that I find Page's guitar playing not only on this album, but the first 3 as well, to be incredibly boring when compared to people like Robert Fripp, a man who was trying to push the limitations of the electric guitar past that of which it was capable of at the time, then you have a white boy imitating his favorite blues musicians. Really, anyone with any kind of working brain would in inclined to pick Fripp, but that, for some reason, is not the case. It is a sad affair when someone like Page is held above people like Fripp & Iommi.<br /><br />Hell, even Greg Ginn (Black Flag) is a far more interesting guitarist than Jimmy ever was.<br /><br />Plant's vocals are just dreadfully uninteresting, as opposed to Roger Daltrey, a man who seemed to be pouring his every ounce into most of the Who's material all the way through their career. But, some people think he's the tops; apparently these people love having the same thing, namely BAAAABY, shouted at them over & over again.<br /><br />And lets face it, no one cares about the bass in a Zeppelin song, unless you yourself are actually a bass player, so there's that; want bass with talent and energy?: Yes & Rush come to mind instantly.<br /><br />Now onto the topic of Bonham; he is the only member of the band for whom I hold any respect, but he still isn't as impressive as, say, someone like Keith Moon, the man who holds the eternal title of Rock drum God.<br /><br />Finally, Stairway to Heaven has to be one of the most disgustingly rancid attempts at poetry in a rock song in the history of music (since the first caveman smashed a rock onto the ground, creating some sort of rhythm, all the way to today.)<br /><br />Now, I realize in this I've stated \\"Zeppelin is no good, listen to this band instead.\\" and I realize that this is a silly comment to make, but its no more silly as stating the Stairway to Heaven is the greatest song of all time.aveman smashed a rock onto the ground, creating some sort of rhythm, all the way to today.)

0307269760|5.0|The thing about Alice Munro is, she makes it seem so EASY.  Of course, it's never easy translating the core of human emotions with a few deft strokes.  Or to capture universal truisms in a couple of beautiful words.  Unless, of course, you're Alice Munro!<br /><br />Take, for example, the haunting story \\"Child's Play\\", about two young girls and a special needs child.  Munro writes: \\"Children of course are monstrously conventional, repelled at whatever is off-center, out of whack, unmanageable.\\"  In a brief sentence, she dispels the notion of childhood innocence and flexibility and reveals children for what they are:  afraid of what is strange.<br /><br />Or take a quote from the signature story, Too Much Happiness:  \\"When a man goes out of the room, he leaves everything in it behind.  When a woman goes out, she carries everything that happened in the room along with her.\\"  Does this writer understand the human condition or WHAT?<br /><br />Munro draws her readers deftly into a sort of alternative world, where the people ring true, the situations, even when bizarre, seem real, and the recognitions are surprisingly of oneself.  There is much pain in these stories;  in Dimensions,  a woman who must soldier on after her husband murders her three children.  In Wenlock Edge -- in my mind, one of the best in the collection -- a college student feels compelled to read to a benefactor stark naked, and endure a humiliation that will likely always affect the way she views literature and learning.  In Deep-Holes, a mother must cope with a flipped-out adult son who condemns her for not being \\"useful in life.\\"  And in Face, a boy with a deformed face connects and separates with a childhood friend who performs self-mutilation.  The final, title story focuses on a real-life 19th century Russian mathematician and novelist and reveals another aspect of humanity entirely.<br /><br />The writing is not flashy, not post-modern, and not self-conscious;  just powerful, ambitious, and pitch-perfect from a writer who is correctly touted as one of the top writers working today.  At the end of the book, \\"too much\\" seemed not enough at all;  I await her next collection.correctly touted as one of the top writers working today.

B00005JPUN|4.0|This is a surprisingly enjoyable and engrossing film.     To be honest I wasn't expecting much from it. Re-makes of classic movies usually disappoint. And this one follows in the wake of three previous versions - two of which are universally acknowledged as all-time greats. So what on earth could a fourth attempt bring to the table?     Add to this the film's troubled production history and much-publicised tales of failed test-screenings, shelving and re-cutting and it doesn't sound inspiring.     But I was pleasantly surprised. It's very watchable from the outset and draws the viewer into a disconcerting world of isolation and dystopia.     The film does a remarkably good job of recapturing the powerful sense of unease and creeping terror that was the hallmark of the original Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. It succeeds well at translating the themes of the original film into a modern context without merely repeating them in a different setting. It really hits the mark in terms of creating a disturbing sense of contemporary paranoia.     Does it have it's faults? Yes. Niolce Kidman's character, for instance, is at times annoyingly slow at grasping what she's up against and walks a little too predictably into trouble. And some of the plot solutions are a bit convenient to say the least.     All in all, I don't think it's quite up there with either Don Seigel's original or Philip Kaufman's re-make of Invasion of the Bodysnatchers. Then again, Seigel's original was apparently viewed as cult curiosity in the 1950s before being hailed retrospectively with the passing of decades. And I recall that Kaufman's re-make got a pretty tepid reception when it was released in the 1970s - but time and TV repeats have established it as a worthy classic in its own right. How many of the films we regard as classics today were immediately considered to be when they first came out? The Invasion has the feel of a film that critics will probably be alot kinder to when they look back in years to come.     In the meantime, The Invasion ought to be enjoyed as a very compelling sci-fi thriller that's intelligent, thought-provoking, well-paced and far superior to most offerings in the genre.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Hi everyone! This is my first review and I must tell you that this is the most challenging workout that I've tried in a really long time. I've tried just about everything from;Turbo Jam, Hip Hop Abs, The Wave, Barry's Boot Camp, and the Fluidity Bar to name a few,all of which are good workouts with Turbo Jam being the best. The big difference is that Jillian's workouts are alot shorter and just as effective as these which have much longer workout times.     As a someone who'll readily admit that I'm a infomercial freak, this is really a great workout that will keep you interested and challenged. I'm someone that loses interest really quickly if it doesn't provide a challenge, and quick results. Jillian's workout delivers on both counts. After 5 days with 1 day of rest I'm still on level 1 but the change in my endurance is two-fold and just seeing myself really progress from barely being able to make it through the warm-up to being able to keep up with Anita (beginner) without stopping is really amazing!! If you've done the workout you know what I mean. I'm so proud of myself!    I do it in the mornings before going to work which I find really motivates me to not cheat so much during the day. I got this for $9 at Walmart, its the best $9 that I've ever spent. Take care and happy working out! This was so fun.
B000GCFX3Q|1.0|I could not stand this book. I never met a character that talked so much. It was just so horrible.
1416572287|5.0|I'll admit that when I first saw the title Chad Orzel's \\"How to Teach Physics to Your Dog\\" I thought it was going to be about classical physics. That's pretty much my only quibble about this otherwise engaging introduction to quantum mechanics. As I was reading I started to remember my high school physics teacher who used his dog, Bowzer, in all of the problems he gave us.    Orzel uses his 'conversations' with his dog, Emmy, to illustrate the differences between how atoms, particles of light, and sub-atomic particles behave as compared to the everyday objects that are the subject of classical physics. I can probably rattle off a half-dozen concepts that I remember specifically because of the connection to Emmy (and her bunnies, squirrels, dog treats, and canine competition). It's really a wonderful writer's tool that makes what could have otherwise been a dry and boring subject very approachable.    This is my first foray into quantum physics so I'm not qualified to comment on the accuracy or completeness of the material although it did correct several misconceptions and incorrect interpretations that I'd been taught about Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.    I was pretty worried that I wouldn't be able to get through the entire book and that I would either find the material too boring or too complex but that was definitely not the case. This really is a very light introduction to quantum physics presented in the simplest terms possible. I don't even think you even need highschool physics to appreciate it. Just curiosity.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|After a five year absence, Dido returned in 2008 with \\"Safe Trip Home\\". This album is a departure from her electronic based music of the past, which she ditched for a largely acoustic sound. Part of that reason is the change in producers. Her brother Rollo of the band Faithless produced her first two albums- 1999's \\"No Angel\\" and 2003's \\"Life For Rent\\". On this new album, the production duties were split in half- one half was done by The Ark and the other half was done by Jon Brion, who also did the first single \\"Don't Believe In Love\\". A few famous guests stop by on \\"Safe Trip Home\\", such as The Roots member ?uestlove on \\"Never Want To Say It's Love\\", Brian Eno and Fleetwood Mac's Mick Fleetwood on \\"Grafton Street\\" and Citizen Cope on \\"Burnin' Love\\". This is a wonderful album from start to finish, and the only problem that I have with it is how Arista Records handled the project. It seems as if they were more interested in Jennifer Hudson and Whitney Houston's comeback to give this album proper promotion. Do yourself a favor and purchase this album.
B002NWRMVS|4.0|I'm really enjoying the new album- I see some poor ratings mixed in there but I like the new album. Listening the 1st round I wasn't sure but just as in the past, the more I listen the more I like it. Even my two yr old is trying to sing along in the car (He likes Young Blood)

So i figured i should read the book before i saw the movie since i didnt know anything about the plot i just heard something about soap and obviously fighting.  Well i was completely blown away by the book, and the movie. This thanksgiving we went around the table saying what we are thankful for.  I said im thankful i read fight club before i saw the movie or knew the plot.

I have never had a issue with anything I've ordered from here.
B0018SWA56|5.0|I read both books in a matter of a month.  I definitely would have not put either of the books down, but I was reading them right around the holidays.  Griffin's, \\"Something Blue\\" offers such a solid, true, and deep perspective on love and friendship. There is a pleasant meaning and undertone of life towards the later part of the book.  It was a complete page turner and I literally had to pry myself away from the book to resume normal daily activities!  If you liked \\"Something Borrowed\\" you'll love \\"Something Blue\\".
B002T9H2ME|5.0|MOON is one of those rare gems of a movie that do not come along very often.  Unexpected would be the word that describes the feeling I had when I first saw it.  I did not expect such an excellent movie.  Many films that have far larger budgets miss the mark, but MOON nails it dead on.  The performances by Sam Rockwell and Kevin Spacey are nothing short of tremendous.  The obvious nod to 2001: A SPACE ODDESSY'S HAL 9000 are very clear in the voice of the computer GERTY 3000.  However, the emotional difference that GERTY gives brings originality to the film.  Spacey is perfect for this role.  The plot moves slowly, but is never boring.  Intriguing is the best way to describe this film.  It is cerebral science fiction at its best, but it does not take a genius to understand the plot or the complexity of the characters.  The viewer feels for Sam and amazingly for GERTY as well.  Hands down this movie is a masterpiece of writing and ingenuity.  It is a MUST see for any sci-fi fan, and even folks that hate sci-fi will find it enduring and gripping.  Do not miss MOON!
B002R5V7MG|4.0|I was somewhat disappointed with this DVD because of the inclusion of a very modern work by John Adams so-called City Noir. Although this would be a suitable noise for a background of a horror film perhaps since it contained absolutely no melody or tune I consider that it was most unsuitable for this concert.A work by Leonard Bernstein  would have  been more appropriate ,The Symphony number one by Mahler was magnificent on the contrary and I enjoyed this enormously. Both the quality of the sound and picture was beyond reproach.Thus I feel rather shortchanged as far as I was concerned.Gustavo has great panache and it is a most exciting conductor
B002QW7AJY|3.0|PANDORUM is a decent movie that exploits the old \\"monster on board\\" syndrome that Alien masterfully created back in the day.  It is almost like a \\"zombies in space\\" epic.  This should come as no surprise considering the fact that people involved in the RESIDENT EVIL movies were involved in the making.  Immediately watchable and full of typical sci-fi/horror fun, PANDORUM is a film that most enthusiasts will enjoy.  The film has some seriously redeeming qualities and some original concepts.  The paranoid members of the crew and the desperate desire they have to figure out what is going on is very well played.  The plot is a little herky-jerky but still a very fun film.  It also has a positive hopeful ending which is rare these days.

I know for sure this series is great, but its not a wonder why you can get the Blu Ray cheaper than the regular dvd set. I am now in the process of finding out how I can get a refund or at least an exchange for the non Blu ray set.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|I loved this movie. It was nice to see something clean for the whole family. That's not easy to come by these days.<br /><br />When young Nicolas moves in with the old man I became worried that his abuse of Nicolas would stop the movie in its tracks. However his kindness and love for the boy really showed how Nicolas was a Saint.<br /><br />The English dub wasn't bad. I didn't find it distracting from the film. However I would have liked to have the option of watching the film in it's original language with Subs.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This season was so fantastic!  The writer really made me want to reread Revelation just to see how close he was making this story line.  The new characters were funny and annoying (ie. \\"bad\\" angels) at the same time. Castiel and Chuck are the best!  Sam and Dean have really developed their characters to a level I never thought possible. This is worth the investment.  In fact, I purchased the download last season and then bought the box set this year as a gift for my daughter! I do recommend you start with Season 1.  There is such character development between Sam and Dean through the seasons.  I love this show!!!
0679731725|5.0|When climbing into Kazuo Ishiguro's, \\"The Remains of the Day,\\" one feels as if they have stepped out into the manor of a great and romantic landscape; winding vales and flowering trees among green hedges, a scenic pond in the countryside that begs attention; it is as if the verdant air rises from the pages fermenting the reader in a haze of beauty, longing, and the great undertow of dignity within this life; such large planets of questions orbiting; the way that Stevens voice literally melds like a sunset so easily into the mind, his inner dialogue, so succinct, so clear; so refined and with such great desire to succeed; that I can hear him now talking to himself about the validity of his witticisms, and whether or not he showed enough attention to Miss Kenton during their evenings with cocoa and conversation. The International upheaval and the moral implications of siding with the Germans during WWII; such an unforgivable error, this costs the Lord Darlington dearly, and even Stevens whom it is obvious, is more bound up in his Lordship than even his poor and trying father. The images of Stevens father trying so hard in his old age to do the simple tasks, is quite heartbreaking; and that he is referred to in conversations so removed; stills the soul, I say.<br /><br />Sureness of tension rises to shake the dust from their rugs and bats the drapes with fierceness. Stevens puts all else aside for the sake of his profession, rather, he denies his own life; the validity and importance of events taking place in his life, in order to eclipse and follow the needs of his Lord. He has become the epitome of Butler in such a way that he falls into an ocean of other people's needs, regrettably, the lower staff, or even the equal staff become invisible to him and he pushes their lives, and sufferings aside in order to concentrate on his job; yet, internally, he is quite a mess of all this pushing aside.<br /><br />On the night of losing his father, one gives a sudden gasp, when the reality of the event is upon Stevens and he turns throughout the evening with such a terrible grace; a great ease in suffering, as if he were a member in a silent dance troupe and following a set number; he keeps turning and turning away from the reality of the situation, his father is dying - - his father has died! - - Stevens is crying and doesn't even know it; such heartbreak in stepping over the lives of our loved ones in order to pretend and put away reality as if it were simply silver to be shined and set in place; and rather, Stevens only source of hope is his pride on pretending or rather carrying on; and this is the stoic role that so many men are made to play within their lives; he believes he is sacrificing for others; and tells himself that he is sacrificing for his Lordship, and ultimately for the sake of world affairs; yet, this is such a lie. If he had only prepared himself a bit more, and trained someone else to step in should an emergency arise, then he could have pulled himself away for just a few moments to help his father. Such a thought would not be entertained for Stevens would n'er have someone else step in to do his job; \\"My Lordship needs me,\\" I can almost hear him say.<br /><br />One of the most heartbreaking of scenes is when Stevens is trying to figure out how to see his father and the Frenchman says he needs his feet attending to; this is the crux of the situation; and Stevens, I do feel his soul was torn in great sections of despair, without missing a beat tells the Frenchman that the Doctor is on his way; a death has occurred in the house, his father has died and look what is being attended to, the feet of a noble man. Such heartbreak.<br /><br />It is Miss Kenton who tries to pry him out of his little shell and force him to pay attention to the rest of the players around him. This is not a solo, Stevens. Life, is not a solo affair; though he has made it out to be as such. Not necessarily that the other people do not matter; not atall, moreso, that Stevens and his feelings do not matter. He has spent his entire life serving others that he cannot serve his own life. This is the tragedy. And it is only in such great pockets of life that seem to withhold themselves until almost the very end; that the past comes out from behind a cloud and beckons to Stevens; he finally snaps out of his life long stupor and grants his heart one wish: Miss Kenton.<br /><br />One does not come away untouched from this novel. And rather, like the swell of a defiant wave moving stealthily towards the shore, with a deliberate undertow set on taking out at least one inhabitant from their cherished island; this story moves up and over the very deliberate workings of a life; and washes him out to sea, tearing him to shreds at the end; and Miss Kenton, in her defeat, turning away from someone she loves so dearly, in order to simply go on.<br /><br />I do not want to let the grand masse of superlatives out of the gate to come and crash upon Mr. Ishiguro's novel, for he over writes such pretensions with finesse; a novel so simple in its complexity that it lands atop a wiser branch; creating a standard all its own.nd his feelings do not matter.

B0012CJQY6|5.0|I found this series engrossing when someone lent it to me.  Then for Xmas I gave it to my grown son (it's not for younger viewers).  I haven't heard whether he has watched it yet, but I'm sure he'll find it engrossing, as I did. [A year later: nope, he didn't get engrossed, and finally gave it back to me.] Vic Mackey, played brilliantly by Michael Chicklis, is such a mixture of admirable and detestable qualities that he gives a fascinating and credible picture of the moral complexity of human beings.  And the rest of the cast does a beautiful job, too.  Glenn Close was a guest star for one whole season, and other big-name stars in other seasons.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Rather than write a review for each remastered Beatles cd, I'm going to roll them all into one.<br />These remasters exceeded all of my humble expectations. The sound is incredible! The amount of detail that was hiding in these songs is amazing! Ever since I started listening to them, I've heard vocal harmonies and instruments (and effects) that I never noticed before, which, as a fanatical Beatles fan, truly surprised me. I have listened and re-listened to all of these albums since I was 14 years old.<br />These records now have a depth which had previously eluded them on everything but vinyl. I highly recommend the entire line (with the possible exception of the \\"Yellow Submarine\\" album, the one remaster I didn't bother with).<br />The album that benefits most from the facelift is [[ASIN:B0025KVLTC Revolver (Remastered)]], although The White Album didn't fare so badly either. [[ASIN:B0025KVLTM Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Remastered)]] sounds like it was recorded yesterday; the final piano note on \\"A Day in the Life\\" will knock you off of your feet.<br />In my final analysis, yes, I know- you've probably shelled out hundreds for the original cd release of these albums, like I did. (I bought mine over 10 years ago, so it's not that big a deal to me.) And it's ok if you're reluctant to spend the cash again. Start with your favorite, see what you think.<br />As far as I'm concerned, it's worth it. This is the greatest body of music to come out of the last hundred years. And now you can hear it like it was meant to be heard.

1400052173|5.0|I've heard about the HeLa cell line, used in biological studies for years.  It was touted as immortal and very important as a means to use human cells to study drugs, disease, in fact all manner of medical and biological study.  I can remember wondering where it came from but never knowing the details.    This book answers this question.  Henrietta Lacks was a poor African-American woman born in the south.  She lived in Baltimore and sought medical care at John Hopkins which at the time was segregated.  The book discusses the circumstances under which the cells were collected, the ways the cells were used, and how this affected her family.  Unfortunately it is also the story of racism and how the rich and powerful prey upon the ignorant and poor.    It is an interesting book for all those who like biological and medical sciences and I would recommend it to them

B000LC55F2|5.0|At the end of the 19th Century, two stage magicians working in London become bitter rivals: Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman), performing under the name 'The Great Danton', and Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale), known as 'The Professor'. They each seek to upstage the other, and when Borden develops a seemingly impossible trick that has him apparently teleporting across the stage in a second, Angier becomes obsessed with finding out how he did it, an obsession that leads him to Colorado and a meeting with a man named Nikola Tesla...<br /><br />The Prestige, released in 2006, is an adaptation of the excellent Christopher Priest novel of the same name, directed by Christopher Nolan of Memento and Batman Begins fame (his subsequent project to this movie would be The Dark Knight) and sharing several cast and crew with the comic book movies, including Christian Bale and Michael Caine. The Prestige is a superb film which may actually be the finest translation of a work of literature to the screen that I've ever seen. The film is incredibly faithful to the themes and spirit of the novel, but not slavishly so. Ideas from the book that would not work well on-screen have been jettisoned, whilst the novel's modern-day framing device has been removed and replaced with a new one that focuses the story much more closely on the rivalry between Borden and Angier. At the same time, the novel's conceit of taking place entirely through the pages of the two men's diaries is actually translated successfully to the screen, and the changes made to the central twist of the novel actually make the idea even more disturbing and horrific than in the novel. As with the novel, upon finishing the film the viewer may be tempted to immediately watch it again in full knowledge of the secrets revealed at the end, whereupon it turns into a different movie.<br /><br />The film's success is built around its two protagonists. Bale and Jackman turn in supremely accomplished performances (the latter possibly in a career-best performance), each having to play a complex, driven character each of whom is carrying weighty secrets and mysteries. Their escalating rivalry is particularly well-handled. Some may feel that the two characters are too obsessed with their rivalry and we don't see many other facets of their personalities, but given that the entire movie is driven by their rivalry, this is understandable. The supporting cast is also excellent, particularly Michael Caine as Angier's assistant, Cutter, Scarlett Johansson as Olivia and the curiously effective partnership of David Bowie (yes, that David Bowie) as Tesla and Andy Serkis as his helper, Alley. In fact, it feels like there's a whole other movie Nolan could go and make about Nikola Tesla that would be as fascinating to watch.<br /><br />Nolan's direction, having to handle a complex, non-linear narrative and not lose the audience in confusion, is very good. At one point Olivia tells us that once you know the secret of the trick, it becomes rather obvious, and the film is like that. Rewatching the movie, it's almost incredible that you missed all the (in retrospect, obvious) clues pointing to what the truth of the story is. This is where the real success of the movie lies. Most of Priest's novels have a moment which is known as the 'Priest Effect', where the reader feels a trapdoor has opened beneath their feet and they realise everything they thought they knew was not only wrong, but perhaps never existed in the first place. The idea that this could be translated to cinema seems unthinkable, but Nolan delivers it here with considerable success. This is a movie where the rules are fluid and shift, but once you know what is going on, it all makes sense.<br /><br />The Prestige (*****) is a most accomplished film, well-paced and dramatic, with a tremendous sense of mystery. It is a puzzle box of a story where all the pieces fit together satisfyingly at the end, and rewards repeated viewing. It is available on DVD (UK, USA) and Blu-Ray (UK, USA).Ray (UK, USA).

1416594787|5.0|Great book updating the classic evidences for evolution by natural selection.  This book was written because Dawkins is fearful that the \\"Dark Ages\\" are trying to make a comeback under the guise of \\"Intelligent Design\\".  If and when reason succumbs to faith, the world will be in trouble again, as it was when religion set the rules. Besides the updates, there is, of course, a significant amount of ID bashing.  All the evolution by natural selection arguments are presented in a lucid, logical fashion using Darwin up to the latest findings from science.  Unfortunately, reason is lost on the faithful because faith makes you blind to the truth.  If you want to see, Dawkins can help you lose the shackles of faith.

1416572287|5.0|How to Teach Physics to Your Dog presents Quantum Mechanics to the layperson. As Quantum Mechanics is very complex and its results often counter-intuitive, this is no easy task. Having read several introductory books on Quantum Mechanics, I can say that the author did a very good job with this book, especially in regards to portraying the counter-intuitive aspects of Quantum Mechanics. The author presents the material as a dialogue between his \\"talking\\" pet dog and himself. Basically, at the start of every chapter, the dog comes in with a new question about physics and the author provides an answer. In addition there are comments, many times funny, made by the dog throughout each chapter. I felt this device was useful in two ways, one, the humorous comments make for some light relief amid the difficult subject matter, and, more importantly, the questions put forth by the dog, named Emmy by the way, are sometimes questions that I would have asked had I been there. In each chapter, the author presents one part of Quantum Mechanics, focusing on the conceptual aspects of each sub topic. Mathematical notation and the notation of physics are mostly absent but there are a lot of diagrams including Feynman Diagrams (used to explain aspects of Quantum Electrodynamics and Virtual Particles). Other topics covered are: the particle-wave  duality of light, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, the Copenhagen and Many Worlds Interpretation, The Quantum Zeno Effect, Quantum Tunneling, and Quantum Entanglement. I really liked this book. I found myself reading sections several times over to get the most out of it. I feel that I have really enhanced my understanding of Quantum Mechanics. If you are looking for a conceptual introduction to Quantum Mechanics, I highly recommend this book, it will not swamp you in detail and the explanations are really good. This coupled with the light relief offered by the dog, and occasional allusions to the history of the subject, make for a fun and informative read.informative read.

As a matter of fact, the dolby sound is of poor quality.I have to listen to this concert in stereo 2.0. I should have bought the regular dvd version if i wasn't getting HD sound!

The blu ray quality is crystal clear unlike some blu ray movies I've bought and had to return!  The audio separation is fantastic in this movie. Nothing is more frustrating to me than buying a blu ray movie that is not recorded  in Dolby HD, DTS HD or uncompressed HD. Isn't this  why so many of us have bought blu ray players? I hate when the movie studios repackage older movies to blu ray and don't bother to change the audio formate. I don't know why but it seems like every movie Tom Cruise is in doesn't have HD audio, from the Mission Imposable trio to the Last Samurai. I feel if your paying for a HD movie, the movie should come with HD sound!! Anyways, you won't find a better movie for action than Ronin!

B0026P3G12|3.0|Although DVD buff has a valid point from the pro, this CD enters the Pop music and will attract more people, when other pros can't create this much buzz in such a short time. It definitely served the purpose of the show\\"-Britan Gor Talent\\"-profitable Air time and reruns, and a followed commercial debut and some modest profit from finalists. From the business point, this album is very profitable attempt using her overnight sensation, and, rather witnessing a moment of a touching modern time Cinderella story.   And, she is an entertainer, not a professional vocalist yet. Last year Susan Boyle picked the right dramatic song she sang over decades for BGT, and it worked. And, thanks to her, this is how I got to go back and get familiar with Ruthie Hanshall and the musical again. Think about the impacts on the media alone!      To reach and entertain the broader general audience, the good voice and the talents are not the only key for the success. And, I can see how long Susan Boyle's chance will last without further vocal training and her revamped image. But, she clearly stated that her dream has come true already.    I notice that British Music industry is quite geared into Cheesy ballad songs through the winter season. And, Britons expect this kind music in the cold seasons whether they like it or not. I am sorry that she had to pick and record these easy listening songs. I wouldn't play this album during the warm seasons myself. This is why I rate this album as 3 star, but I would give full 5 for Susan Boyle or a big applause, still after a year.

B0015AARJI|4.0|The rumble feature that this controller has makes your games a lot more immersive than you might realize. I was using the old, non-rumbling controller that came with my early production PS3 for the longest time. Most games make use of the DualShock 3's rumble features now. I was surprised at how much more the rumble adds to even downloadable PSN games like PixelJunk Shooter. Maybe it's because I play most of my games on an iPod Touch or Nintendo DS that I now notice the extra kick that rumble adds to the game playing experience.<br /><br />My only complaints are the following:<br /><br />NO USB CABLE<br />============<br />It doesn't really make sense that Sony didn't include one. Sure, you can use the one that Sony included with your PS3 system. But now that you have another controller, doesn't it make sense that you might want to recharge more than 1 controller at the same time? My early PS3 system has 4 USB ports, so you can recharge 4 controllers at once directly. The current PS3 \\"Slim\\" system has 2 USB ports, so why did Sony skimp on including an extra USB cable?<br /><br />Fortunately, the USB A-to-Mini B cable that you want is common. You already may have a few laying around your house. But this is still inconvenient. Amazon sells the USB cable that you want here: [[ASIN:B001TH7GUK AmazonBasics  USB 2.0 A-Male to Mini-B Cable (6 Feet / 1.8 Meters) [Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging]]]<br /><br />SLIPPERY TRIGGER BUTTONS<br />========================<br />When Sony released the original, non-rumbling PS3 controller, there were complaints that the R2 and L2 trigger buttons weren't good because they curve inward (towards you), making it easy for your fingers to slip off of these buttons. Sure, there are some really good gamers who can compensate for that but if you're use to the Xbox's controller, you'll notice the difference. With the DualShock 3 controller, Sony had the opportunity to fix the trigger buttons... but they didn't. That's disappointing.<br /><br />If you love the trigger buttons on the Xbox, there's an easy fix. A third party makes a set of low price ($4.99) caps which snap over the trigger buttons to make them curve outward (away from you) like trigger buttons should. Judging by the tremendous positive feedback for the caps, there are many people who don't like the existing trigger buttons on the DualShock 3.

0307454541|1.0|I, too, am bewildered by the glowing reviews and attention this book has garnered.  I have about 60 pages left to muddle through but I've read enough to feel I have been duped by the marketing machine of publishing.  I had a preconceived idea about this book before I read it-that it would turn out to be a learned page turner by a gifted novelist who sadly died all too soon. That Knopf published it also seemed a vote for quality. Ugh. Was I ever wrong.<br />One reviewer mentioned the ubiquitous reference to coffee and I had to laugh out loud every time I saw how the cup of joe appeared on nearly every other page. Gads, can't they do something else besides make coffee and drink it?<br />I'm still wondering what the mysterious flower arriving every birthday has got to do with anything. Maybe I'll find out when I finish the novel-but maybe I was skimming the text so early on, that I missed all that resolution. I don't know, Lisbeth is not a fully rendered, interesting character. The rape explanations are gratuitous and I really don't care about anyone in this book.  A huge waste of time at 640 pages.
B0026P3G12|1.0|As a trained vocalist, I know what good singing is supposed to sound like.  Susan Boyle is not a good singer.  Her singing is forced, stilted and very artificial-sounding.  A great singer makes it sound effortless, and Ms. Boyle makes it sound like it took every fiber of her being to finish a song -- this is not effortless singing.<br /><br />The album is terribly over-produced as well, which, I suppose, was the producers' way of trying to hide the imperfections in her singing.<br /><br />If you want to her heartfelt performances by singers who actually know what they're doing, try Maureen McGovern or Kristin Chenoweth.  Don't waste your money on this one.

This film has made an awesome transformation, especially in terms of audio and visual remastering.  I had no problems with this DVD format.  Many parties have been writing about errors concerning a disc within their box set of Blade Runner; this concern does not apply to this DVD release.  There are several cuts (releases or versions) of this film, and any Blade Runner fan is surely to have their favorite; the Final Cut is my favorite.  Despite the addition and subtraction of particular storyboard elements, this \\"Final Cut\\" is seemless in it's production.  In fact, I was so engaged in the mastery of the \\"Final Cut\\" that I couldn't recall what had been changed from so many years ago.
B001E45XT4|4.0|these headphones are heavier and bulkier than previous ones i have gamed with.  They fit snug and are comfortable.  Sound is pretty good, comparable to my logitech ones.
B002VEB228|1.0|This movie is horrible. Terrible plot, bad dialog, lousy acting and just plain dumb ending pretty much killed any hope this movie had of being good. The other reviewers must be high because this in no way deserves a single star, let alone four or five.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I love this movie and now in Blu-ray it looks and sounds even better. It's a Christmas regular and I often can't fight the urge to watch it in July.
B0001HLVS2|1.0|This DVD was damaged and I was not able to view it. It was returned and picked up on 1.4.10 and I have not yet received a credit for it. Please let me know how to proceed and receive my credit so I can purchse another DVD. I was very excited about viewing it and would still like the opty to do so. Thank you.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is an ordinary lady with a magical voice.  Her dream has become her reality.  This CD was an inexpensive and uplifting gift for my elderly father.  I'll be buying another for my husband and myself.  We loved learning and seeing her story.  I thoroughly enjoy hearing her sing.  Dreams can come true!
1594488916|2.0|I'm glad I only borrowed this from a friend rather than purchasing it for myself. As a librarian and a once upon a time book collector I really have a resentment for book thieves and this story tells of one totally egregious thief and the bookseller who caught him. I did find this book easily readable which is why I gave it two stars rather than one.  But both the author and the thief, John Gilkey, irritated me to no end.  The author made him sound like the Robin Hood of the rare book world, take from the 'rich' booksellers and give to the 'poor' thief.  John Gilkey acted like it was his \\"right\\" to steal books and anything else that he coveted.  On the other hand, I admired Ken Sanders and thought the author shortchanged his part of the story.  There just wasn't enough about him and his quest to catch and stop Gilkey.     The book seemed to have been padded a bit, though, because every few chapters seemed to repeat themselves.  There was  John and his \\"jobs\\", John and his stealing and John getting caught and going to jail or prison.  Then it would start all over again.    I liked it but it's not one I'd highly recommend.

B000001FMX|5.0|I remember as a 17 year old I bought this because of the cover to shock the  parents. Men dressed liked girls with make up? I liked some of the songs. Now a few years later (ha ha) this is the one album I return to over and over to listen to when I want to feel what rock should be. Cannot get enough. Set me off on a quest to build a doll collection. The raw energy, the attitude, the down right dirty in your face punk is the epitome of what rock should be. I love it. You will too. Buy this album. It will not disappoint.

B002SJIO5E|4.0|*****WARNING:  KEY PLOT POINTS REVEALED IN THIS REVIEW*************************<br /><br />The great thing about the thoroughly original and entertaining sci-fi film District 9 is the way that it takes our preconceived notions of what \\"alien\\" films are and completely turns them upside down.  This is no mere story about humans fighting it out with a vicious race of creatures bent on world domintation.  No, District 9 is something different.<br /><br />The movie focuses on a violent slum in Johannesburg, South Africa populated by aliens who arrived on earth 30 years ago.  In order to contain any diseases they migh be carrying, the government rounded the aliens up and forced them to live in an internment camp in order to keep them isolated from the citizens of the city.  Over time the camp has grown into a ramshackle community full of crime and poverty.<br /><br />It is into this slum that the film's main character, Wikus (a remarkable Sharlto Copley) enters to serve eviction notices to the inhabitants who the government plans to begin moving to a larger, less accommodating place of residence.  Things take a turn for the worse when he comes into contact with an alien substance which causes him to begin transforming into an alien himself.<br /><br />The bulk of the film follows Copley's character as he goes from an insensitive, spineless buerocrat to an alien sympathizer who ends up fighting against his own government which is trying to harvest his alien body parts in an attempt to operate the creatures' weapons.  It is amazing to watch Copley as his character transforms from a cowardly self-opportunist to an angry, resourceful fugitive who does what he has to in order to survie and finally into a friend and ally of the misunderstood and mistreated aliens.<br /><br />There are parallels drawn to apartheid, segregation and even the AIDS epidemic that put this film a cut above most other summer action flicks.  In the end though, District 9 is at its heart, an adrenaline filled, edge of your seat thirll ride.  The fact that it is also smart and surprising is just icing on the cake.de.

0316035904|3.0|The first book I read of Sedaris's was Me Talk Pretty One Day, which was a mistake since I think it is probably the funniest book I have ever read.  Holidays On Ice is still a good read, although it pales in comparison.  It is funny, and if your family is as twisted as mine, then you could use it as a stocking stuffer.  The best essay was clearly the Santaland Diaries, but Six to Eight Black Men was also extraordinarily funny.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I found this DVD to be very enlightening. We need to know what goes on in the production of our food. How can we make good choices if we don't know what's being done to the food?  I think everyone should see this video. It will open your eyes to what the big food industries are trying to do to us. We need to fight back and now.   If you want to eat healthy, then see this video.

B001GCUO52|1.0|This is suck and very very disappoint in Final Destination series. If you want to buy I really recommand to rent first.
0385737424|5.0|This book is fabulous, the best book I've read in years.  This is bound to be a classic, to stand the test of time.  It was thoughtful and original, with sympathetic characters and a fast, smart plot.  I would recommend this to all ages.  I'm going to be giving this book to both my son and daughter, and I can't wait to read it again myself.  I loved it from beginning to end. A masterpiece.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I have this movie in VHS and wanted it in DVD. This is truly a classic and so funny. Life today is not so funny at times, however this movie gives you a way to stretch your laugh muscles. We need to laugh!
B000035Z3K|5.0|Classic Bela Lugosi. I loved the DVD. I own the majority of Bela Lugosi movies and sadly I hadnt had this one in my collection. I had scene the movie multiple times and know almost every word but had never actually BOUGHT it.  The quality of the dvd was good. I purchased it from a used seller because quite frankly I have no desire to spend a crap load of money on ANY DVD. It came in like new condition. Some people have complained about the soundtrack but I didn't even notice it.
0385334206|3.0|\\"Breakfast of Champions\\" is not Kurt Vonnegut's best work, but it still has one enviable trait, and that is the unmistaken Vonnegut voice. Mr. Vonnegut has one of the most unique voices in American literature and he uses it to full effect here. Although I rarely agree with his political and religious views, I still return to him because he writes in one of the most conversational tones I have ever come across. You feel like you and Vonnegut are conversing. It is this quality that allows you to forget some of the novel's more inane aspects.<br />\\"BOC\\" has no plot to speak of, and I would be hard-pressed to narrow it down to only a few themes. Vonnegut tackles several possible thematic tracks half heartedly throughout the novel. These range from digressions on the relationship of the creator and his creation, the intrusion of an authorial persona throughout the text, and the nature of free will. Vonnegut also hearkens back to earlier gems such as the importance of minor life and details, the inequalities of capitalism, etc. And at times, he delivers some biting satire and thought provoking lines (and even paragraphs) on these topics. But alas, that is all he delivers. An occasional spark does not a fire make, and a witty or interesting point scattered here or there does not a novel make.<br />This novel lacks cohesion...and that was Vonnegut's goal. I get it. I just don't like it.<br />I have read a lot of Vonnegut, and I find this to be his weakest work by far. You may disagree, and I think that is the point.
B00003CXA6|3.0|This video was purchased for my grandson for Christmas. He was very pleased with this movie.
0743572750|5.0|My daughter recommended this series, based on my love of Twilight and Harry Potter.  I simply loved this series - and I really like the readers for the audiobooks.  Highly recommended!
B002SJIO4A|3.0|This movie came with a great deal of hype and frankly it just doesnt live up to it.  The docu. feel of the movie is a nice touch, but really I never cared much about the protagonist, he just seemed like such a yutz, and this story has been done to death.  Yeah, yeah, I get the story is a metaphor for Aparteid, set above Johannesburg etc..but it just really didnt resonate with me.  The special effects are a low budget, but really not bad, but the creatures are horrible, I mean what in the hell are they suppose to be?..couldnt they have come up with cooler looking aliens?!!..have they not seen, uh Aliens?!!..this movie is similar to Alien Nation, but really not as interesting and they ending is sort of..uh O.K.?..Maybe had the acting been better, and the story not so rote, I may have been able to get into this film, but frankly im clueless at to why it got so much hype.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I had watched this show while on network tv, loved it, wanted my child to be introduced to a clean show with lots of history!!  I hadn't seen the 1st-3rd series, I was amazed at how much history was included & how the writer paid such close attention to period times and details. Of course, the relationship between Dr. Quinn & Sully is so pure & sweet, yet sexy & appealing without being vulgar; you find yourself cheering when they finally kiss! This show has something for all generations, children enjoy seeing how school, chores, discipline & daily life happened years ago. Dr. Quinn inspired my daughter by showing how women can do just about anything, with help and support of a good family and friends & emphasis on education. We loved this show and I would suggest it to anyone, especially if you have respect for history & lifestyles of the past!  The clothing & town setting, meadows & mountains & all the beautiful scenery, the Native Americans, African Americans, the immigrants, all make a beautiful show, I only wish this show could have continued, networks wanted trash on tv instead of good clean viewing for children. One sad reality this show reveals, is what happens to people when Greed & fortune come their way, it definitely shows how people change & what happens to a whole town & people in it, when progress comes along. We have progressed ourselves into a nation full of debt, greed & fortune seekers, we all need more God in our lives and this show has a great way of showing how important religion was  then & still is today. Thank you to Beth Sullivan for a Great Show, when are you going to make another one? Please include Joe Lando & Jane Seymour
B001T3RA8M|5.0|This is a new Author for me, and I am impressed, the story line is fairly simple, straight forward, us against the really bad guy,lacking the multiple sub plots that can sometimes be distracting. I like the original form of magic used here too. There is plenty of action and cliff hangers to keep you turning pages. My only complaint is the use of the word Charter as a noun and an adjective without ever fully explaining the true nature of Charter magic. Maybe it will be explained more as we continue in book two. I bought the box set trilogy and I am glad I did.
0307473708|4.0|If you're a fan of the TV series Dexter on Showtime I'd recommend reading the inspiration for the series. If you pay attention to the credits at the beginning of the show, you'll notice that it says that it is based upon this book and not the series. That is because there are quite a few differences in the book series than there are in the TV series. Although, I have seen some ideas from the other books implemented in the series. It's like they took the book series and reworked it completely and then rebooted it.     I've grown to like both the series and the books. Oddly enough, the TV series is more visceral than the books. The books tend to be more introspective. For me, more Dexter is always good, even if they are in parallel universes.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|It seems ridiculous that Lucas wouldn't release all six films on blu ray. However, they did take years to release it on DVD and that original release seemed to be limited. It's like \\"These movies are too special. We can't release them on a new format.\\" That never made sense to me. Other great movies, such as Pulp Fiction, haven't gotten the BD treatment yet, either. So, to paraphrase another reviewer, you can get Brüno on Blu Ray but not Star Wars. It boggles the mind.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|See the movie BELOW, about the WW2 submarine?  A sleeper right?  Seeing this with low expectations reminded me of seeing that with low expectations.  Especially when the ending credits came up and I realized that they made it all the way to the end without losing it.    When I first saw the trailers for Pandorum I said (as it seems a few others did), well, I gotta see it but it's probably another Event Horizon or an Aliens(1 or 2) ripoff attempt or a space zombie \\"bug hunt\\".  (And I joked with my wife that Quaid must need some quick cash to re-do his basement or something, and he'd probably be killed off in the third scene when it's too late to get your ticket money back.)    Not that there's anything wrong with any of those things, Event Horizon was good for the first half till it overexplained the obvious, Aliens 1/2 were classics that deserve homage and Resident Evil (1 and 3) were great zombie fun with excellent fight dancing.  (And every actor is human with human cash needs.)    I missed this in the theatre and forgot about it till I went looking for MOON on DVD and noticed this came out at the same time, MOON was out of stock so I got this.    It's good, I have to say it's really good.  Like all science fiction / horror fans I pride myself on being able to guess the inevitable twist and I'm pretty good but not this time.  Not for the multiple twists.    After being SOOOOOOOOOOOO INCREDIBLY DISAPPOINTED by Avatar's ripping off Every Lousy children's use-syfy-to-cover-the-stinking-preaching storyline, this Pandorum film was a refreshing fun adult Action/SF flick.    Good multiple ending twists, fun and toe-curling fight scenes with well done good-olde \\"bug hunting\\" ;-) and a final ending that while \\"happy\\" actually worked well and satisfied without feeling like it was tacked on just because it tested well.    Glad I bought it, it's a keeper.  Cudos to the crew and cast.  Remember guys, the good SF usually doesn't do well at the box office but eventually rises tothe top in home sales.
B001GCUNWQ|1.0|If someone having his genitals groped, castration jokes, and getting kicked in the groin are your idea of family-oriented humor then this may be the movie for you. All this occurred in the first half of the movie and was enough to make me pull the plug on the rest (I used my \\"Parental Guidance\\"). If this makes me \\"out of touch\\" then I gladly accept that label. On a positive note, I thought that the animation was outstanding.
B0025KVLT2|5.0|It was an unexpected surprise when my wife and son presented me with the Mono Beatles remasters for my birthday earlier this month. I had always heard that the mono versions of many Beatles albums were considered to be better mixes, more what the band and producer George Martin intended and so forth. Plus, for every Beatles fan, it was hard not to notice the annoying distribution of instruments in some of the stereo releases, one plopped on the left, another on the right -- a particular liability in the iPod age when we hear so much music through ear buds, but bothersome even back in the LP era.<br /><br />The Mono remasters are very good, but whether they are a superior listening experience to the stereo remasters is something that can only be answered on an album-by-album, and in some cases track-by-track basis. Some of it is also a matter of taste.<br /><br />But one thing is, to me, undebatable.  The mono version of \\"Rubber Soul\\" is the biggest revelation of the whole box set, and it should be the default version available for the ages.<br /><br />The stereo separation was particularly problematic for \\"Rubber Soul,\\" and now we can hear it was almost sabotage. Because the songs are so strong, fans loved it anyway and the album has always had a high reputation. But when you hear how it sounds in mono, you will realize you've been missing the intended experience, and have had to tolerate an inferior one.<br /><br />\\"Rubber Soul\\" is a much bigger album than I knew. It had always seemed to be one of their quieter, lighter collections, and sonically a precursor to the \\"lo-fi\\" indie rock sound that started with REM.  Forget all that.  This album is every bit as powerful as \\"Revolver\\" or \\"Abbey Road.\\" Not only does the remaster boost the hard-rocking sound of the more aggressive tunes like \\"Drive My Car\\" and \\"Run for Your Life,\\" it also displays the richness of sound and large palette of musical colors you associate with their big production numbers from \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" or \\"Magical Mystery Tour.\\"<br /><br />I'm thinking in particular of \\"The Word.\\"  This was never a song I really focused on before. On the mono remaster, you realize what a big, multi-faceted recording this really was; full-bottomed with a driving beat, syncopated bass and propulsive piano, but dazzling on top with swirls of vocal harmonies and guitar sounds. Similarly, the classic song \\"In My Life,\\" which always seemed kind of frail and gentle to me, turns out also to be much more explosive.  And the more acoustic tunes, like \\"Michelle,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" and \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" sound much more fiery and urgent than before.  I've always thought \\"Michelle\\" was just a sappy Macca love song -- no more. It's ingenious and complex and really satisfying.<br /><br />The remastering obviously is one of the major reasons for the new dimensions of sound you can hear on \\"Rubber Soul.\\" But I also think that, in this case, the effort to achieve stereo effects robbed the album of its muscularity, a problem that is corrected once and for all on the mono version.<br /><br />As of now, you can only get the mono \\"Rubber Soul\\" in the box set. If you can, get the box set. There are lots of other reasons to own it:  \\"Help!\\" and \\"Beatles for Sale\\" were clearly meant to be heard in mono, and you can make a strong case for the superiority of the mono mixes of \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and \\"Revolver.\\"  It's great to hear some of the singles in mono again, like \\"We Can Work it Out,\\" \\"Rain\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" in mono.  And the previously unheard mono version of the White Album is fascinating.  That album was the first Beatles set that was recorded and mixed with stereo in mind from the beginning, but the mono versions of the harder-rocking songs like \\"Birthday,\\" \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Yer Blues\\" sound stronger to me.<br /><br />But if the whole box set is too much, then at least keep an eye out for sales of used copies of mono \\"Rubber Soul.\\"  It's essential.I'm thinking in particular of \\"The Word.\\"  This was never a song I really focused on before.

0385504225|3.0|For those who haven't noticed, Mr Brown writes every novel approximately the same way. Take specifics out and the plot lines would be identical.  This book is no different.  That having been said, like all other Brown books, this one is fun to read and contains some surprising levels of complexity.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I never write reviews, but I feel Turtle Beach and consumers need to know about this product. I bought these for Xmas for my son to use on XBox Live. I work in IT and have been troubleshooting for many years.  I tried another XBox 360. I tried different controllers both wired and wireless.   We are approaching the end of January,  and we are waiting on the new cable.    The Good:  The sound quality is great and setup was very easy.    Now the Bad:                 - For $200 I expect a quality made product and these units are made extremely cheap. On first inspection, I thought                  they were a toy.  That is how cheaply they are made.               - XBox live chat is terrible.  Feedback, popping, cracking, echo, the list goes on.               - SUPPORT IS TERRIBLE... I work in the IT industry and we call this \\"CUSTOMER NO SUPPORT\\"                 - You have to email support and WAIT.  It took three emails and almost 2 weeks for a response back and with a phone                  attached I received an email back.               - By email they diagnosed the issue as needing a new cable.  Days going to RMA and days to ship.  No shipment                  information is available (tracking).               -  The COMPANY HAS NO PHONE INFORMATION except a FAX number available.    During Xmas the packaging was discarded by mistake or I would return these to Amazon for a refund.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I purchased this DVD set as a gift for my husband who has been a fan of Doctor Who since its beginnings. We have watched all the seasons of David Tennant as Doctor Who. My daughter has even become a great fan and plans her social calendar around new episodes. We will miss David Tennant as Doctor Who but look forward to the new Doctor and new adventures.  The Complete First Series is very good to watch and see how it all begins.  I highly recommend the series and will be purchasing more seasons in the future.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. The acting in The Dark Knight is magnificent. Christian Bale plays the best Batman next to Adam West and Michael Keaton (and he was definitely the best choice for the \\"dark knight\\" batman). But as good as Bale is, he doesn't compare to the scary good role Heath Ledger plays as the Joker.<br /><br />When I first heard that The Dark Knight was going to reprise the role of the Joker, I was a bit upset. In my mind, no one could top the wonderful job that Jack Nicholson did in the original Batman. However after seeing the movie, I quickly changed my mind and gained a whole new respect for Ledger as an actor. The two Jokers are quite different (as are the Batmans).<br /><br />The movie itself is great. It's entertaining and will have you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. I was never a big Batman fan growing up, but this movie makes the dark knight seem so much cooler than I remember him being. The blu-ray disc itself is typical, and nothing special.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This saga warms the heart.  It is a great story about the friendship amongst grown men, the tribulations of journeying across the country on horseback and of course the element of love.  The characters are likeable and the development of each of them is thorough.  My husband and I watch this movie over and over again, never getting sick of it.  Highly recommended.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Most DVD to blu-ray conversions are just \\"okay.\\" Some are downright horrible. However, Star Trek: Season 1 was ported over beautifully. Not to mention this particular blu-ray season collection isn't absurdly overpriced.<br /><br />The blu-ray conversion is great. The colors turned out wonderful. I've never seen this show look so great. The audio sounds okay, and they've redone a lot of the special effects with new CGI and 3D technology. I think that the new special effects look great, but if you're a purist and would rather view the original versions, you can switch back and forth between the two.<br /><br />There are some nice extras included as well, and the packaging is nice. I would recommend this to any Star Trek fan who is looking to jump into the world of blu-ray.
B0024F08RO|5.0|It keeps you off your toes but on your knees in this ultimate Prisonbreak experience
B0013N7AD8|5.0|The blu-ray version has the same special features as the DVD anthology. However, the picture quality (and sound) has been very well represented in the new generation technology that is blu-ray. The film quality (with it's loads of blacks) looks very good. I absolutely loved the original movies and this one just makes them look and sound better.<br /><br />The one con I will note about this collection is the digital copy. The digital copy is only of the first movie. Out of the original four, Batman Returns was my favorite. I would rather have had the digital copy of it, or of the first two movies (since they were both directed by Tim Burton).
B00129H7VS|5.0|I just finished watching the first episode of the band of brothers series and I was really impressed with the overall production. Great cast, beautiful cinematography, brilliant score, gripping story...what more are you looking for in a mini-series. If you like war movies/documentaries, this is as good as it gets. And the blu-ray really enhances the overall A/V experience. Two thumbs way up!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a wonderfully written and acted series. I really enjoy war movies (I'm not sure why), and this one kept me on the edge of my seat for all ten episodes. I just could not stop watching it.<br /><br />The story takes place during World War II. It follows a group of soldiers from boot camp, through the end of the war. The story is very detailed and intricate. I like how the characters develop and how attached to them I become; which brings heartache when one is killed during the course of the series. And I absolutely love how the actual survivors from Easy Company introduce the episodes and provide commentary.<br /><br />Another thing I loved about the DVDs/blu-rays themselves are maps and ranks. You can view maps of each episode, and track Easy Company's movement throughout the world and what battles happened where. You can also view the various Army ranks and what it takes to get the rank.<br /><br />The blu-ray quality is superb. The picture is clear and crisp, and the audio will blow you away. Especially if you have surround sound, you can hear the bullets whizzing by and the mortars all around.
0810982862|5.0|Since I am totally taken by this movie, and since they used (at least in part) the same tools that I use everyday to create parts of this film, I really wanted to get a better look at the art from the movie. I wasn't disappointed in the quality of the images or the printing - I just wish there was more included in the book.
B00164GDD2|5.0|The movie itself is a timeless classic; entertaining and enjoyable for all ages. The transfer from DVD to blu-ray is excellent as well. It has really been cleaned up and the colors evened out. It also has tons of extras.<br /><br />My only complaint is not including Ghostbusters I and II in a blu-ray combo the way they did the DVDs.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|If you love the movie this CD can take you back Pandora in your mind. James Horner has done he's usual stunning job of enhancing all of you emotions related to the on-screen action. I think that I would know it was his work just from hearing the soundtrack. Definitely worth the money.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Iron Man is an excellent movie for anyone, regardless of age. Children can enjoy it because it's understandable to the younger views (and not too violent). Adults can enjoy it be it's fun, witty and entertaining.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Tony Stark to a T. I don't think they could have gotten a better actor to play this character. The story was well written and leaves plenty of room for sequels.<br /><br />The blu-ray version is very sharp, crisp and has some pretty nice special features.
B00003CX5P|2.0|As the first of the three prequels, and therefore the most distant from the original story, 'The Phantom Menace' was probably always doomed to be the least interesting. I was prepared to accept this film would be mostly background and story development, and that I wouldn't fully appreciate it until I'd seen Episodes II and III. All fair enough.    But Lucas made the problem worse by starting too far back, to the point where the movie feels almost disconnected from the Star Wars story. The trade dispute at the centre of the plot is supposed to highlight the beginning of the Republic's downfall, but is too mundane and obscure to be engaging. And it's impossible to make any connection between the boy Anakin and the greatest villain ever seen. It might have worked had Anakin been an interesting character, but he's basically a whiny brat (something which does not change at all throughout Episodes II and III). He's just plain annoying and adds nothing to the story.     Anakin apart, the acting and characterisation is a mixed bag. The two male leads do okay, although it's hard to accept Obi-Wan as a cocky young apprentice. Natalie Portman, unlike Episodes II and III, is at least given something to work with, while Ian McDiarmid was the obvious choice to play the younger Palpatine. However, Darth Maul, who had the potential to be a really cool and interesting villain, is largely sidelined......and do I really need to mention the laugh-at-him-not-with-him Jar Jar?    There's also a very leaden feeling to the production, a problem which plagues all three prequels. The spontaneous fun of the originals is missing, and the acting and dialogue is often predictable and wooden. Despite it's child-friendly gloss, too much of `The Phantom Menace' is taken up with the boring political posturing, which seems to suck all the fun and enjoyment out of the movie.     The only thing I really liked about this movie was watching Palpatine skilfully manipulate the trade crisis as his first step to becoming Emperor. That's probably the one and only key element in this movie for fans of the original. As for the rest, you could easily begin at Episode II and not miss very much.  There's no real reason the prequels couldn't have started as Episode II did, with Anakin already a young Jedi, which makes `The Phantom Menace' a bit of a waste of time, and a missed opportunity.

B001QOGYFO|1.0|Whiteout is a chopped together mess of a murder mystery movie.  A murderer at the South Pole must be caught and it happens a U.S. Marshall is stationed there.  There were several sub-plots in Whiteout that just did not flow well into the main idea.<br /><br />Whiteout focuses on the activities at Amundsen-Scott Research Station and the exotic setting of Antarctica is the \\"hook\\" for the movie.  The wind and snow are blowing as the first ever murder is discovered.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays the lead as Carrie Stetko, a U.S. Marshall, stationed in the remote station.  In the opening scene she has been sent out to investigate the first murder in the snow and ice.  She realizes the body must have been thrown from a plane and the investigation begins.  Whiteout then produces way too many slasher scenes as well as disjointed logic throughout.<br /><br />The script was uninspired and lifeless as the winter landscape it was set in.
0767811070|5.0|WOW what a great movie I watched this for the first time in 1994 when i was younger but my father only limited me to the part where doe boy was taken away in the police car. Once I was old enough to see the full movie I was hooked. Laurence Fishburn and Cuba Gooding were very good I think as a black man the movie was on point but you have to listen to Laurence's character because he makes perfect sense. The movie has violence, sex, drama, and its a real life experience.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is a favorite for my husband and daughter ... great to have it available on DVD to replace the old VHS set.
0547260695|5.0|For anyone loving this timeless allegorical story, this version brings it to the eye in more tangible ways.  It was wonderful to anticipate what would pop up when I turned the page and there they were -- the unforgettable words, albeit in English, and lessons about life and caring and loving.  This version is also a terrific introduction of the story for young readers who will not yet understand the depth of expression meant by the author, but will perhaps, enjoy getting lost in the fantasy of a \\"little prince\\" from another planet.  In short, I loved it!

B002Z8LPZ4|1.0|I didn't have high expections to begin with but let me start with the good:    N/A    The bad: <no spoilers>   What was the original flight crew waiting 6+ hours for?    Why did we need the shower shot? (This was nudity?) Was this for Kate to have one scene where she wasn't hidden in a hi tech parka? Trust me, she should have stayed in it. I saw no reason for this other then to possibly offend not so picturesque female viewers.     KB lacks creditability as a US Marshall. Is the constant display of her badge supposed instill confidence among the geeks who are really only interested in partying?    Why did KB's hand/fingers suffer instant damage when touching the door wheel yet her face could repeatly withstand the Antartic elements via direct wind exposure? Where was the frostbite on her chin?    The average age of the 100+ 'scientists' on location is roughly 25. Who's running things?     The main characters lacked substantial reasoning for banishing themselves to the ice. I heard their lines but they lacked substance and believability.    What a waste of resources...the planet's and mine.

Wonderful stories!

B002VECMAY|5.0|Having flown >55k/yr for 4+yrs, I personally understand Ryan Bingham's (George Clooney) world: Blackberry in hand, efficiently filling grey TSA bins, hotel key cards as home key, snatching a boarding pass from a kiosk while by-passing non-Elite, living a week from rolling luggage, laptop on hotel WiFi, hotel shuttle as one's commute, and satellite offices as one's \\"home\\" office. These images of what people hate about travel are truly fond reminders of a frequent flyer's home. His Omaha office's and corporate apartment's sparseness both prove his fear of not being on the move. The camera carefully but quickly frames each fleeting postcard from the frequent flyer's world. Their world is not just a dream but a daily reality briefly hinted to some and lived by only a few.<br /><br />Warning: frequent fliers expecting a rehash of their lives and loves will be disappointed. The movie must venture into emotional drama thus is not a documentary about high mileage.<br /><br />Stereotypes of men as emotionally unavailable simpletons fall under Ryan's admissions of growing loneliness and desire to see someone more than once: his casual hotel fling, Alex Goran (Vera Farmiga). Ryan's purposefully designed world of emotional isolation, as many mature male knows, is unsustainable. Attending his sister's wedding pangs his conscience. His loyal partner/fling saves Ryan from a potentially lonely event. Life is a tease: we just want to be loved and to love.<br /><br />New hire Natalie Keener's (Anna Kendrick) proposal of firing via videoconferencing grounds Ryan's high-flying ambitions. Her Ivy League psychology degree belies her chilly exterior, each glance able to efficiently e-fire an anonymous worker bee. Ryan's boss charges him with tour guiding Natalie through in-person firings on the road. Beyond the comedy of Natalie's new-to-flying hiccups is the familiar notion that coworkers become adopted families. Work experiences become unexpected opportunities to share personal revelations not told to even (or especially) family members. Personal, private turmoils burst into one's professional life. Work and life blur as working hours lengthen, as business travel forces ad hoc families.<br /><br />The movie's purposeful shift to a ponderous ending comes after a series of unexpected turns. Emotional isolation becomes impossible. A family crisis undoes his intentional emotional distance from them. Each firing brings Ryan closer to his own firing. The trainee becomes the trainer. The unfamiliar world of frequent flying becomes too familiar. The theme song \\"Help Yourself\\" sarcastically toasts the new economy. This movie has its pulse on our lives. Widespread acclaim of the movie is thanks to its balancing a fun lifestyle which is based on true stories which relate to our lives: emotionally isolating 1-night stands, unforgivingly impersonal corporate climate, travel as general burden, and family rifts growing and healing. The movie covers much ground without ever leaving home ... pun intended.especially) family members. Personal, private turmoils burst into one's professional life.

B002CZ8PEO|5.0|I love the way Mitch Albom writes. Easy, comforting & pleasurable to read. His stories are warm & told with such honesty. You must read \\"The five people you meet in Heaven\\", after you finish this one. Believe me you'll get hooked, I did!
0061703257|5.0|It's interesting how I came to know about Dennis Lehane.<br />I have a strong opinion that movies based on books do not do full justification to the original unabridged story. Movies like \\"Kiss the girls\\" and \\"Along came a spider\\" are examples. Individually these movies are good but nothing when compared to original books. The only exception is \\"Lord Of The Rings\\" which I truly enjoyed as a book and as a movie.<br />So when I saw trailer of \\"Shutter Island\\" on Youtube and when my friend told me that it's based on book, I immediately went searching for it.<br />Later, I came to know that other two favorite movies of mine, \\"Gone baby Gone\\" and \\"Mystic River\\" came from Dennis Lehane as well. I intend to read these two books very soon too.<br /><br />Anyways, coming back to current book in hand (Shutter Island), all I can say is that this book starts with increasingly urgency and gives visceral shock towards the end.<br />Nothing prepared me for the final chapter of this book. I would suggest that you re-read the prologue and final chapter once you are done with the book.<br /><br />Lot of other reviews here have already given the plot of this book so I wouldn't bother laying it out again.<br />I truly hope that the movie do full justice to this amazing and gripping book.<br />Highly recommended for thriller genre readers.<br /><br />Thanks for reading this review.

This is the one I listen to when I need a Stones fix, but am tired of Satisfaction, Honky Tonk Woman, Miss You, Jumping Jack Flash, and all the other great Stones songs that have been virtually played to death by mainstream radio.    This is the one I crank when I wish I was in a bar chugging beer and telling everybody to f*** off, I'm on a break.    If I'm gonna rock, if I'm gonna press Play and let it go, if I'm gonna forget about everything going on around me for a while, and just jam, this is the one.  Yeah, even Tumbling Dice.

1594488843|4.0|1. AUTONOMY the urge to direct our own lives; to make decisions ourselves, independently.  2. MASTERY the desire to get better and better at something.  3. PURPOSE the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves.    The conventional wisdom is that intrinsic motivation is the motivation that really matters.  However, if we're going to be truly successful we need to pay attention to the external motivators, like big money.  This isn't the case for anyone much less top level achievers.  Daniel Goldman author of [[ASIN:055380491X Emotional Intelligence: 10th Anniversary Edition; Why It Can Matter More Than IQ]] has build a career and book series on the simple idea that the most successful among us are actually very in tune with others around us and find ways to empathize and help.  In Richard St. John's most recent book, [[ASIN:0973900911 8 to Be Great: The 8-Traits That Lead to Great Success]]  the sixth ingredient to success is to SERVE others because no one is successful alone.    There is plenty of evidence to support the idea that external motivation is ineffective.  Mary Ann Collins and Teresa Amabile write in their, \\"Handbook of Creativity,\\" this theory; \\"The intrinsically motivated state is conducive to creativity, whereas the extrinsically motivated state is detrimental.\\"  Their work on the matter is the tip of the iceberg in terms of downgrading the value of extrinsic motivation.    Dan Ariely, U Gneezy,  G. Lowenstein, N. Mazar Federal Reserve Bank of Boston Working Paper No. 05- 11  July 2005  NY Times Nov 20, 2008  MIT Economist, Studied the effects of external incentives on students at MIT and they set up games based on creativity and strategic thinking and give them a rewards system that was based on performance with three levels: (1) really big reward, (2) medium reward, and an average performance got the (3) lowest reward.  \\"As long as the task only involved mechanical skills, bonuses worked as they would be expected; thehigher the pay the better the performance.\\"  However at the point the games required even a rudimentary cognitive skill\\", a larger reward, \\"led to poorer performance.\\"    They took the same research; structured the games similarly, and repeated their tests in India where they would have removed any cultural bias as well as increasing the allure of financial gain to see what would happen.   On its face we would assume that because these are financial gains offered to people of little means they would be highly motivated and therefore perform very well.  You would expect to see the people offered high rewards for the best performance to indeed perform the best out of three groups.  But what happened? Those offered the average size bonuses performed at the same level as those offered the lowest level reward. And those offered the highest level of incentive performed worse than the other two groups. \\"In eight out of nine task we examined across three experiments higher incentives led to worse performance.\\"     The research was performed again in the London School of Economics, looked at 51 separate studies of pay for performance plans inside of companies. Dr. Bernd Irlenbusch stated, \\"We find that financial incentives.... can have a negative impact on overall performance.\\"     These same scientists have given us a new approach that is based more on the intrinsic motivators that produce the best results. It isn't going to work to continue to uses bigger carrots and more threatening sticks. If we really want to raise our children to be the next \\"Great Generation\\" we need to provide them with something other than outdated junk science and folklore.  Dan Pink has researched intrinsic and extrinsic motivators extensively and found the science to be based on three common elements, AUTONOMY,  MASTERY and PURPOSE.     I enjoyed this book just about as much as I enjoyed Mr. Pink's first book [[ASIN:1594481717 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future]]
B0010X8NF0|4.0|I haven't seen \\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\"  but to my mind Wes Anderson hasn't missed a beat yet.  As a whole Anderson's collective works meld into an interesting observation on the quirks of men.  Marketed as a comedy, \\"The Darjeeling Limited\\" tackles heavy themes though Anderson's askewed humor is also present.  Topics like life, death, and the fragility of family bonds are present here.  There's a certain poignancy on display here.  This is a demanding film that I think would reward the most ambitious viewers.
0446569895|5.0|This book is one of the best i've read in a LONG time.  Ozzy has such a great sense of humor.  He tells it like it is, and never holds back.  The book is very funny, yet touching as well.  He covers it all; from his poor upbringing to his illustrious career, and his hard fall from the top.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes ozzy just because he's a character himself, or for his work as a musician.  You will be highly surprised by this book.  It's not like any autobiography you've read before.
0446567337|1.0|I could not pass this one up - Did I actually read that someone considers Nicholas Sparks a \\"Master Storyteller\\"???????????  I'm still holding my sides on this one.   Better we should call his mother a wit! (sorry Jane Austen, how could I pass that up?)  better we should call 'Johnathan Livingston Seagull\\" classic literature of our generation.    Anyone can make a reader cry - all you have to do is stomp heavily on their sensibilities (or their toes).   PUHLEEEZE  Gross sentimentality is not the answer.  And his only solution to plot seems to be that.    It actually makes me shudder to think that people buy all this man's books.  and then recommend them to others.  And then every year, he comes out with another one but a different title.   same old story.  It's like reading one of those c-rate bodice ripper things, but you know with a man writing it, someone is going to die.    (that seems to legitimitize their writing.)    I know these are sometimes gross characterizations - sorry for that.  but when the shoe fits Cinderella, you're doomed!  where is Joan Rivers when we really need her anyway?  stay away from these - stay far away!!
0553381687|4.0|fantasy novels are dumb but I need a fix once in a while.  Gave Robert Jordan a shot a few years ago but it was awful dreck and I thought that was finally it for me and fantasy.  But I'm glad I gave Martin a try. Pace and plot are the novel's best qualities, he keeps the page turning and you can read fast without missing much.  Some good twists and turns and I enjoyed the multiple points of view.<br /><br />I thought the characters were well fleshed out; not too cliched.  But not all that \\"grey\\" as others have claimed in their reviews: the baddies and goodies are pretty obvious (at least after book 1).<br /><br />Other than The Wall however, I didn't find the world all that compelling; Martin doesn't have Tolkien's feel for geography or names etc.  It's not all that fantastical either, kinda ordinary and I'm wondering whether this book will stick in my memory banks for long.<br /><br />If you're looking for something really fantastical and indelible I'd recommend Eddison's \\"The Worm Ouroborous\\", Peake's \\"Titus Groan\\" and Harrison's \\"In Viriconium\\"<br /><br />Still, I'm pleased I read this book, it's fun (and a good antidote to ploughing through Wolfe's \\"Book of the New Sun\\") and I'll try the next one in the hope that Martin keeps the pace up.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and finally bought the 2-disc special edition as a Christmas present for my husband, who is prior military. He really enjoyed it, too. It's an amazing story, and we can watch it over and over again. I haven't bothered to watch the extra dvd that came with, so the 2-disc special edition really isn't a big deal (to me, anyway), but Sergeant York is a classic. If you haven't seen it yet, you should.
B001QOGYFO|2.0|It is a great idea to combine a top-notch murder mystery with the polar isolation and bone-chilling cold. I thought this movie had promise with a woman U.S. marshal investigates murder in Antarctica, days before the last plane out for the season.<br /><br />My wife and I and our two Greenland Huskies had lived in the Alaskan Arctic for quite a while, and well this might feel like home. But about 10 minutes into it, we found problems on almost every front.<br /><br />For example, when there is a wind chill of 80 to 100 below, you don't warm up a plane for a few minutes and zoom off. The same with surface vehicles --which you never turn off unless you have plug in heaters, etc.<br /><br />And the movie falls into the same trap of most polar-type movies --you can't bundle up a star and then have them toss off their hood here and there, just for a camera shot.<br /><br />Even with all that, it seemed like the story itself might carry the day. But about halfway in, it seemed like more fun to go outside with a dog for fresh air.<br /><br />There are many potential thrillers from actual events in the north and south pole areas.<br />And a few movies like \\"The Fast Runner\\" have been successful. But a great, gripping murder mystery in Antarctica still remains to be done. I can hardly wait.<br /><br />Earl
B001CDZZI6|1.0|despite the fact that this type of information seems like it would be incredibly helpful, and despite the fact that Gallup claims to be on the cutting edge, you don't get an access code when you purchase the kindle version of this book, so if you're looking to have your strengths evaluated, pick up the physical book and not the kindle edition. i wasted $9 on this, and now have to go buy the actual paper book.
0312370849|5.0|I love love love this book. It is beautifully written and draws the reader in quickly.
0738711500|4.0|Ciro Marchetti's 'Gilded Tarot' earns 4 stars easy. Josephine Ellershaw's book on the other hand, probably 3 stars. If you are a true beginner than this set will definitely get you interested in further developing your tarot reading, but you should really use the book as a guide rather than the definitive word on the meaning of the cards. She does teach some very important techniques and concepts that other authors tend to ignore. Such as the importance of a Tarot Diary, I can not express how crucial this little notebook will be to you and your study of the Tarot. I did mine digitally by using a wordpress blog that only a logged in Administrator can read. Another useful nugget of information is that you have to understand how the meaning of the cards play off of each other and how they associate not only to each other but to the person you are reading for as well. The reason(s) why this is not a 5 star set, is because of the way she dictates information to you, and how she very clearly forbids you from deviating from her teachings. Now, if you know anything about the occult then you understand the effect of doing what you feel is right for you. If you are not comfortable then it probably wont work for you. So learn the concepts and techniques you can from the book and expand on it, do not let this be your first and only jump point. Listen to your instincts.    Although the deck is beautifully rendered, there are a few symbols and imagery that I take issue with, especially if you know the Fools Story from the Rider-Waite-Smith (RWS) classic deck that will be necessary for a beginner to know...    The Fool - the cliff and the little pack is missing. The whole point of it in the story is that although the fool has everything he needs and is looking ahead he is not looking at what he is doing and even though the little dog is missing I like the metal hoop that is wrapped around his foot because the dog seemed like an outside influential force here it is by his own doingthat he is going to fall. It can be argued that the fool is juggling the signs of the zodiac and all he needs is what the universe provides him but to a novice that meaning can easily be lost on them, especially when the magician unfolds the pack in the story.    The Chariot - There is no sense of conquest in this image, to me it is more about the post-conquest, this woman has already achieved what she has set out to do and is now being held on a pedestal even. The importance of having living creatures pulling the chariot (not sphynx statues) is so the reader understands that you have to put this advice into action. When the man in the chariot tells the fool that he should come up along side his enemy, match its momentum with your steed but remain in control of their direction, it is one of the more memorable times in the story for me.    Death - A good way to decide if this deck is right for you is to pay attention to the death card. Death is one of the hardest things to deal with and if you can look it in it's face and extract some meaning from it then you will probably be happy with that deck. This death card does not do it for me. The rising sun in the distance, the child in the field and the field itself are all missing. 'Death humbles all' but it is the only way to begin anew. That is why the clergy man is praying to death in the RWS card. The absolute most important piece of symbolism on this card is the rising sun, it teaches you that a new dawn approaches and you realize that letting go of who you are is the first step in transformation.    The Devil - Another misunderstood card and here it can be misinterpreted. There is a reason for the Pentagram to be inverted on this card, it is because your world has control over your spirit. The absence of the two people here make it easy to forget that the lesson in the RWS card is that they are not chained by the devil, but that they have chained themselves to him. They are there by their own will. Remaining blindto faith will leave you with nothing more than frivolity (the grapes in the woman's hand). You can unhook yourself at any time, but only you can do it and most people do not want to.    Please learn the story and when you are finished with this set, take the time to learn the classic RWS Tarot, the original deck is to much for my eyes and I cannot stand that stark yellow that is used everywhere. My favorite deck thus far (until i get my hands on the Legacy of the Divine Tarot) is the 'Radiant Rider-Waite Tarot' artfully re-crafted by Virginijus Poshkus. A masterful update to the one that all others are based off of.

It's alot of squats and lunges, legwork on the floor, pushups off your couch and on the wall, and some pilates moves.      I was running alot before I got pregnant (and still running now), so I feel like I'm in decent shape.  It definitely wasn't over-exerting, but I finished feeling like I had done something good for my body.    The reason I didn't like the video is that I didn't mesh with Erin O'Brien.  She seems a little intense, and it felt like we were moving from one exercise to another---to get as many exercises in the allotted time.  As has been stated previously, the production quality was pretty poor, and it did feel like they just filmed it in her living room.  It was also somewhat annoying having to move furniture around in order to use the props that she wants to use.    All in all, she gives you a good workout, but I just didn't find it enjoyable.  So far, Lindsay Brin's videos are my favorite.
0307387151|5.0|The book Atonement by Ian McEwan is a riveting story of love and lies. The book's plot is about a young girl named Briony witnessing flirtations between her older sister Cecilia and their gardener Robbie Turner. Witnessing these events unfold a crime that effects every character for the rest of their lives. The author did a wonderful job with the sentence structures and the flow of the book. Each sentence gave a burst of images of what was happening. Reading Atonement gave me the feeling like I was standing right there and I overall enjoyed it.        In the story, Briony sees her cousin getting raped, and because of a previous encounter of witnessing what she thinks as her sister getting raped, she then concludes that it was Robbie who committed the crime. Briony's persistent fantasy then changes the characters futures. Atonement is unlike most romance books. There is somewhat a twist in the end where McEwan grasps the feelings of Briony and how she feels she took away Robbie and Cecilia's life together. This turn of events is unlike any book I have read. The reader never suspects the ending which makes this book an intriguing read for anyone, not just romance novel junkies. In this novel, the readers need to know the characters to fully understand the story. McEwan introduced the characters perfectly where I fully understood every character inside and out. This build up is crucial to fully grasp and interpret the story.       Even with the marvelous attributes, the book does have some flaws. The author uses a style where he jumps around from each characters view. It can get confusing and hard to understand at first, but because he uses it throughout the book the reader learns to comprehend it. I was only confused with part two. McEwan does not tell you that the plot is three years into the future at this point until late in the chapter. For readers like me, this was confusing and lost me until I finally understood what was happening.      I enjoyed Atonementimmensely and recommend it to anyone who likes reading romance or drama. I personally see girls liking this book better than boys, but I still recommend it to all. When reading this novel, the reader feels like he/she is standing right there and can relate to the feelings of some of the characters.
B00127RAJY|3.0|it's a great workout, everyone agrees. she knows what she is talking about and that's very helpful! i am frustrated by the DVD setup. you can't advance to the main menu and just start working. you have to listen to the same opening spiel every time, it takes too long. plus, i agree, she could use some work on her cues to move from one thing to the next. i don't stare at the tv while working out. i am sticking with it, though. i'm aching but it's great!
B00288KNL8|4.0|I bought this from Amazon for $9.99 with 4 3D glasses included. I got the dvd in 2 days. What a great deal!<br /><br />I just love this movie. I've seen it twice, as in two days in a row and might watch it again. The first time I watched it with my daughter and son, we put on the 3D glasses. Although we experienced the 3D effect in a few scenes but, boy, my eyes kinda hurt 'cause some scenes would probably look better if it's not 3D, plus I also wear eyeglasses. We watched the 2D version the second time and I thought that was better to watch.
0307269981|5.0|Almost finished reading \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" this one is definetly a page-turner. Starts out with a hook and builds to a frenzy for the reader and the plot. Highly recommend this one to anyone who enjoys a good thriller with a mystery threaded throughout every chapter. Having just finished \\" The Girl who Played with Fire\\" all I can say is hurry May 2010! Loved it!
0061438294|5.0|This was a great book that was very enlightening to the parts of our brain that control nonverbal communication and the many different ways that we communicate through body language. After reading this book i can say i will never look at communication the same it brings it to a much deeper level. This book was very thorough and even contained information on nonverbal body language that hasn't been published before. After reading this book i can now look at people and gain a great deal of extra information of whats going on internally with them by just the way they present themselves nonverbally. I imagine this book will enrich my life and be a life saver in the many tough encounters i will have or potentially tough encounters that i will have avoided. I have rated this book a 5 Star because it really dove into the subject and you can tell the author has a driving passion for studying it. The author has devoted his entire life to Nonverbal Intelligence and has been gracious enough to share all his knowledge in the subject thoroughly.
0061733199|5.0|this book is very good, i like to be outdoors a lot and thought that this book would be good to always have with me, it is small and compact. there are a lot of pictures and drawings to make things as simple as possible.

B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Bee Gees late 60's period is my favorite time for them. This album stands out the most of what made the 60's Bee Gees so awesome. Combining Baroque Pop with psychedelic sounds and doing it so well. They even got 3 classical instrumentals on here. All very enjoyable to listen to. I could do without the 2 country songs though. Some of the standout tracks on here include \\"Odessa (City on the Black Sea)\\", \\"You'll Never See My Face Again\\", \\"Melody Fair\\", \\"Lamplight\\", \\"Sound of Love\\", \\"I laugh in Your Face\\", \\"First of May\\", and the instrumental \\"Seven Seas Symphony\\". Other albums (Sgt Pepper goes without saying) of this genre that are also great include Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\", The Zombies \\"Odessey and Oracle\\", Moody Blues \\"Days of Future Passed\\", Procol Harum \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", The Left Banke \\"There's Gonna Be a Storm\\", and the Kinks \\"Village Green Preservation of Society\\".
B001GCUO4S|1.0|I enjoyed watching the first movie in the series and a few scenes in the second but the franchise has run out of ideas. The fourth installment was released in 3D and may have offered some genuine scary moments in the theater. If you like people dying and cut up in to pieces, then this is the movie to watch. I did not enjoy this at all. I want my money back.....One star01/21/10

0380730405|5.0|DuMaurier's classic gothic suspense novel, the book she's best known for although I wager it's not her best (I have two others by her in my TBR pile, so we'll see).  I remember reading this as a teenager, and always wanted to re-read it.  Found a beautiful leather-bound edition at a secondhand bookstore, and it even includes a smattering of illustrations (I wish publishers still did that!).<br /><br />\\"Last night I dreamed of Manderley\\", that now-classic opening line, is as wonderfully foreshadowing as I remembered, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the story had lost none of its luster in the re-read, which so often happens.  Things are often never as good as you remember, but that wasn't the case here.  It still had the same modern gothic sense of foreboding and subtle malice, a delicious little shiver for the spine.  Nothing supernatural here, yet a haunting is precisely what it us.  Reading it as an adult, married woman as opposed to a 15-year old high school-er gave it a much different perspective, too.<br /><br />I'd forgotten that the first name of the narrator is never revealed, and you know her only as the second Mrs. deWinter.  You never feel a distance in that, though, maybe because she tells the story in a first-person narrative, so it's as if you're reading her diary.  \\"Rebecca\\" is the name that rings in your head, as it's meant to.  The dead first wife of Maxim deWinter - the glamorous, famous and beautiful Rebecca, a haunting presence in every way.  Then there's Manderley, the house of legend that is itself a dark and psychologically haunted character, very much imbued with a life of its own.  Of course there's the unforgettably sinister Mrs. Danvers, who remains to this day a literary template for the classic evil housekeeper.<br /><br />I couldn't quite remember the specific details of the underlying mystery - that is, what really happened to Rebecca - from when I read it so many years ago, but as soon as I got close to it I did remember,and re-read it all again in wonderfully chilling detail.<br /><br />It would be intuitive to assume the narrator is based on the author, as many of those things tend to be, but I've heard that Rebecca's character is based on duMaurier herself, who was known to be a beauty in her day and a bit of a glamour queen in her own right, much sought after by the paparazzi and the buzz of many a social circle.  She may have a skeleton or two in the closet as well - bisexuality, a love affair with a woman, and other salacious bits.  She comes from an illustrious and fascinating artsy family of actors, writers, and painters, and I'd love to read a biography of her at some point.<br /><br />(Soon after finishing this I read the sequel written some years later by Susan Hill, long out of print but which I found at a library sale in Carrollton.  It was faithful to the storyline and the character personalities, but for various reasons I didn't enjoy it quite as much.  Might write a review for it later, if I get a chance.  Now I'm reading a cute little mystery by Joanna Challis that features duMaurier as a young woman involved in a mystery that inspired the Rebecca story.  Having fun with the whole Rebecca canon here.)  :)
0061122416|5.0|Just go get this book.    The Alchemist isn't exactly transformational--it does not present a new, earth-shattering philosophy. But it is profound in its ability to present your scattered spiritual thoughts in a cohesive, structured, wonderful tale. Reading this book, I felt as though Paulo Coelho gathered and organized all the philosophical and spiritual ideas that I believed, or that occurred to me at some point in time, or that I considered and put aside because I couldn't develop them further.    Coelho writes simply and beautifully. The story is inspirational and affirming. As I wrote above, it may not present any new information. However, perhaps The Alchemist's strength lies in its channeling of timeless, ancient, philosophical, truth. Doesn't matter what your belief system is, this book will resonate with you.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|Great movie.  Friends kept telling me how much they liked it so we got a copy and have not only viewed it many, many times, but got it as a gift for a few of our friends that like Beatle music and a good love story.  If you have a HDTV and surround sound, you gotta get it.
0451228731|1.0|I normally do not review books but this ending was so disappointing I had to offer my 2 cents.  It starts out well with some good characters (most who get killed off) and starts to be believable but somewhere in the last third  of the book it goes downhill quickly.  I don't mind the sci-fi but the ending is one of the weakest endings I have ever read.  It doesn't have to be all tied up in a ribbon with no loose ends but come on, this ending was so abrupt and didn't go anywhere it was horrible.  The remaining good characters just disappear from the story.  I'm sure I didn't totally get the tie in with the government and the deeper meaning but it was so poorly explained it wasn't worth going back to re-read.  I read one to two of these a week and I wish I had not read this book.
B00064WSN2|3.0|In the Wake of Poseidon - King Crimson (3.14 stars)<br />Original Release: 5/15/1970<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Peace - A Beginning (2 stars)<br />Short a capella song with lyrics either steeped in profound mysticism or bad poetry (the lyrics irritate me actually).  The song sets a tone of mystery, in any case, and is extremely quiet which is a set up for the loudness of the openning of the next song.<br /><br />Pictures of a City/42nd at Treadmill (4 stars)<br />Lyrics paint terse collages of city experiences.  The musical phrases sound like themes for a detective-crime story which, then, aptly reflects the lyrics.  The images the lyrics paint are direct and unapologetic like our supposed big city crime detective would seem them.  There is horror, vice, violence and all those things that a criminal investigator might contemplate.  Even the title of the instrumental section, 42nd at Treadmill, sounds like the address given to an officer from the station over a police radio.  The instrumental section is introduced via an escalating siren.  Next to its brother song \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" this song is less extreme, more a look at things without interpretation, less angry.  The instrumental section dips into the quiet and as it regains volume sounds more like later progressive instrumental passages of King Crimson.<br /><br />Cadence and Cascade (3 stars)<br />As gently sweet as this song is, the lyrics are absolutely lurid.  Apparently this song is about two individuals of unknown sex (I'm guessing a man and a woman) who hire a male prostitute and the various erotic experiences they have as a result.  This brings a whole new dimension to this song and also sets it apart from its \\"sister\\" song \\"I Talk to the Wind\\".<br /><br />In the Wake of Poseidon/Libra's Theme (4 stars)<br />This song harkens back in musical tone to \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" with its strong mellotron.  Also in the lyrics there is a sense of some strange court where things have gone extremely wrong and order is doomed to decay.  The song is similar to both \\"Epitaph\\" and \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" and looks back where as the other songs of length look forward.  I am not able to make much sense of the lyrics.  But I do enjoy the ITCOTCK-like intense passion that the mellotron helps to bring.  The chorus as instrumental and choral combo comes at the end and provides that great catharsis that only symphonic prog can provide.  This chorus gradually progresses until it fades away; passionate, sad and powerful.<br /><br />Peace - A Theme (3 stars)<br />A pleasant acoustic guitar passage as interlude that drains out some of the drama from the passionate tsunami of \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" and was probably meant to tie together the companion songs at the beginning and ending of the album.<br /><br />Cat Food (4 stars)<br />Interesting piano, played in a frantic style but with great skill.  This complex piano work is the highlight of this dense but light-hearted song.  The lyrics seem to describe crazy women and the unfortunate food that they prepare.  This song, perhaps, introduces the next original sound for King Crimson since the previous album.<br /><br />The Devil's Triangle: Merday Morn/Hand of Sceiron/Garden of Worm (3 stars)<br />The song takes almost a full minute before it becomes audible.  There is a mellotron progression with march theme on bass.  Very reminiscent of Gustav Holst's \\"Mars, the Bringer of War\\" as I'm sure many have noticed.  The mellotron is effective at invoking a mood of fear and despair.  Listening to this long progression is a bit like hearing a monster movie theme that was made a bit too scary.  The progression ends with a satanic horn blast.  There follows a spooky ticking clock, then a return to a manic form of the earlier progression where various sounds arise and fall like the daydream of a madman.  The musical circus begins to loose form until a sound effect like a ripple of sunlight reflecting off of water orthat sound that you hear when someone awakens suddenly from a terrible nightmare and brings you back safe in familiar surroundings.  I imagine that the song as a whole is divided into its three named sections around the clock ticking section which I suspect corresponds to \\"Hand of Sceiron\\".  Like \\"Moonchild\\" on ITCOTCK this song is probably best appreciated with the volume turned up and one's imagination turned on.  This song is an intense, laborious journey and not suited for casual listening.<br /><br />Peace - An End (3 stars)<br />As part of the release from \\"The Devil's Triangle\\", this song brings vocals and acoustic guitar together to conclude the album proper.  The lyrics are cheesy but annoy me less than those for \\"Peace - A Beginning\\".  It is also the longest part of this three part ornamental song.  If this set of songs was meant help tie together the album as a whole, to help make of it a concept album, then I feel that this effor was unsuccessful.<br /><br />Cat Food [Single Version][Edit] (2 stars)<br />Merely a shorter version of the album song that sounds unnaturally clipped off at the end.<br /><br />Groon [Single B Side] (2 stars)<br />Manic guitar and bass and drums; relaxes a bit into a bizarre stroll.  Parts of this song reminds me of 80s King Crimson and it is interesting to contemplate how they have more successfully approached this kind of dense composition later.  The song seems to loose itself in the middle with some more filled out \\"Moonshine\\" like antics.  The song is technically interesting instrumentally, but I don't buy into it emotionally at all.<br /><br />Album:<br />Given some of the struggles that the band was apparently going through around the time of this album, it is not surprising that it seems less coherent, less satisfying.  Besides side A being a seeming mirror reflection of side A on ITCOTCK, the album seemed to struggle with three themes, failing to tie them together at all:<br /><br />1.  \\"In the Wake of Poseidon\\" theme which harkens back to the fantasy-like mood of ITCOTCK.  \\"The Devil's Triangle\\" probably also fits best here.<br /><br />2.  The \\"Peace\\" cycle, which comes off as random mystical, flower-power fluff.<br /><br />3.  \\"Hard, crazy life\\" which features naked, unapologetic views on the real world showing it up to be twisted and violent and bizarre.  This is the theme that King Crimson would seem to focus on going forward and was captured well in songs like \\"Pictures of a City\\", \\"Cadence and Cascade\\" and \\"Cat Food\\".<br /><br />MP3 recommendation:<br /><br />Four Stars (4 stars)<br />1.

B000QUEQBS|5.0|This movie had been recommended to me by my grandson as one of the best movies he had ever seen; after watching this movie with my wife I can see why he said that. My wife on the other hand decided she never wanted to see it again.<br /><br />I found the movie held my interest all the way through and provided the gratifying ending that these movies can often have. The surround sound and picture were convincing and the dialog was easily understood.<br /><br />The picture may go a little over the top with its painting of the villains as totally without any redeeming qualities. The demise of the villains as they are picked off one by one is, however, done with satisfying thoroughness.<br /><br />It winds up being an exciting action film that provides a lot of sound and fury; a fun time for the action movie fan (either guy or gal)!

B001UV4XUG|5.0|For as long as I can remember, romantic comedies have followed a boring and predictable plot - the meeting, the brief breakup, and the fairytale ending. [[ASIN:B001UV4XUG (500) Days of Summer]] is different. It's fresh and original. The movie follows Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) and his infatuation with Summer (Zooey Deschanel). It flashes back into time and into the future of his life over the course of 500 days. Some parts were pretty cool. I particularly like the side-by-side portrayals of Tom's expectations and reality at a dinner party. Definitely one of the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|This movie is well made, entertaining, has a good story line.  special effect is very good.    the only thing is: why do movies always have to make the main character, for no reason at all, just have to be the best (no one can be better than him. he just have to be the best) -- like in this movie, he was first looked down upon by the tribe's girl's brother.  And then towards the end of the movie, the main character became the only person who could master the biggest and strongest flying creature.  Why him?   He is just in that jungle for such a short time, yet he has to be the best.  It feels too much like he just have to be the best.    And what's more, why does the main character always have to go to the other tribe and make baby with the most desirable woman of that other tribe?  This is true in the Last Samurai, Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves (can't remember the storyline exactly but it is along that line) Is it to satisfy some ego?
B000P1QMZ6|5.0|In some ways, this is the best Harry Potter movie. It's light enough for kids, but the story is engaging enough for adults. The beginning of the film really captures the magical world of wizardry, from the goblins to the first quidditch game. It stands well enough alone as a movie - you don't really need to know much about Harry Potter before watching it.    The kids are excellent actors. Rewatching it again after many, many years, I was impressed with the range of young Ron's emotions (by contrast, I find his later character a bit boring and pouty). They're adorable and frankly well cast.     Some of the later Harry Potter films are better produced and have better special effects, but few are so satisfying.
0743497465|5.0|I am a huge Dan Brown Fan and of the five of his books that I've read including the latest: The Lost Symbol I have to say hands down this is the best of the five. It's the kind of scientific/political thriller that you read until your eyes burn, climb into bed resenting the hours of sleep required to recharge your mind and body so that you might pick up where you left off in the morning. Reading through this book once just won't do. It gets better with each read. Brown's research is always impeccable and that gives his plot and sub-plots credibility. There is a very simple formula in writing good fiction. Character + Conflict = Drama. Drama is the necessary ingredient for any novel that grabs the reader's attention at the start and keeps the reader up all night downing cup after cup of coffee hoping to read just one or two more chapters before sleep overtakes you. Dan Brown has not only mastered this formula but he has taken it to a new and higher level. This book has everything, characters, plot, excitement, and scientific hypotheticals. When the rogue special OPS team threw the professor and his sled dog team out of the helicopter, which grabbed me by the throat to the murders and near misses experienced by almost all of the major characters to the where the hell did that come from ending I was there for it all. Three adventures of professor Langdon, although excellent reads all, are starting to get a little stale. Deception Point and Digital Fortress are the kinds of thrillers that I personally would like to see more of from Dan Brown. And like another reviewer  commented: I cannot understand why Hollywood hasn't made this into a blockbuster movie; it certainly has all of the necessary ingredients.<br /><br />Jim Gilliam, Author: Point Deception
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams essentially made the world of Harry Potter wizards with this soundtrack. The classic introduction and Harry Potter themes are continued throughout the series. It's just too bad Williams couldn't do the rest of the movies.
B002BIULQ2|5.0|I'm very impressed with the message this movie was able to portray to a young audience. There were two particularly touching moments that made me want to buy it right away. Butterfly and The Climb are brilliant songs and those songs alone make this a good purchase. Even if you're not a Hannah fan, I think you'll find some humor and sweet moments in the film. Thumbs up from me!

0312263120|1.0|This book is such absolute drek that I was very reluctant to go near anything by Dan Brown again. I've forgiven him for this turd because I enjoyed the movie \\"The DaVinci Code\\". While I despise the deliberate spreading of misinformation, I give him artistic license. Artistic license doesn't excuse the stupidity of Digital Fortress though, it reads like a cheap Hollywood formula. The heroine isn't just super-smart, she's also super beautiful and super stylish? Gee super idea, Dan. Also, for a technical thriller, you expect a certain calibre of technical information, which was lacking. If this review saves one person from wasting time and money, it was worth it...
0385342020|5.0|I really loved this book.  It was not as predictable as you might expect.  In the end you love the main characters even if they are flawed.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|At first, the movie started off really well. I loved that it took place in the 70's, and around Christmas. It was toward the middle of the movie that it became confusing, and added supernatural references. I'm still not sure what Mr. Steward and his employees were supposed to be. I couldn't tell if they were aliens, or people under mind control. Norma and Arthur Lewis receive a black box with a red button on it. If they push it; they will receive a million dollars, and someone dies. Once the button is pushed, they must deal with the consequences. If you were given the opportunity for a million dollars, would you push the button on THE BOX!!!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I picked this up, just thinking it'll be interesting / fun / campy, just like the show.     Quickly, you can feel like you're actually reading something the character, Richard Castle would actually write. I could imagine Nathan Fillion sitting at a computer, with his slanted adorable smile while he wrote this acting as Castle.     I loved it. It stuck true to what you would think Richard Castle would write. It flowed well and was fast paced.     Also, the characters were well written. For the first time, I read a modern mystery novel without getting annoyed at some of the characters' blatant stupidity and blindness to the facts before them. Nor were any of them putting themselves purposely in danger as some other heroines do in other mystery novels.    Recommended this to a friend who has never seen the show and even she fell in love with it and now has begun watching the tv series.     I really hope one day they reveal who the ghost writer is because he deserves a lot of praise for the work he's done.
B000URWYTS|4.0|Came away from reading this book with the question &#34;was it worth it?&#34;. Although I personally didn't approve of the choices made by the author it was very thought provoking. It was well written and presented a side or Wright that was totally new. The ending was so unexpected it left me in tears. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B000003S0D|5.0|Well, Robert Fripp hates this album. But that's Bob, an idiosyncratic musician if there ever was one and is perhaps to be trusted a little less than his fans. Lizard is a strange album to be sure. Fripp plays a lot of acoustic guitar, keyboards and mellotron, there are many guest musicians, and musically Crimson's jazz, rock and classical leanings clash and battle like no other in their catalogue. There are some almost free jazz bits on the \\"pop\\" songs and  Jon Anderson (Yes) sings on first bit of the side long suite Lizard. And Lizard is one of the most ambitious pieces ever attempted by the Kings: it goes everywhere from stately pop to classically arranged boleros with intricate horn arrangements to jazz improvisation. The other songs are a strange amalgam of pop, jazz, classical and what have you, which makes for not a few awkward moments. But I love 'em. While bassist Gordon Haskell's voice takes perhaps some getting used to (he sings everything but the first part of Lizard), I think Robert should rethink this album's worth. It's certainly the most unusual in their entire discography.
0316113077|3.0|I love Elisa and her cakes.  The book is beautiful to look at and is inspiring for your own projects.  However, I wish I'd seen the notice about the error in her book for the recipe for her sugar cookies.  What a waste of ingredients.  I bake all the time and I felt like I should have known something wasn't right just by reading it, but thought I'd follow the instructions since she is the expert.  I was very disappointed.  I will give them another shot with the proper amount of flour, but I tried the chocolate cake also.  It was so inedible, we used the cake as a display at a party and I had to make another cake for eating at the last minute.  I doubt I will use any of the recipes in here again.  I will use the ideas and apply them to other recipes.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|Being a World War II buff, i like to read anything i can get my hands on regarding this period in American History.  After reading Guernsey, i got a glimpse of everyday life during the war.. especially those who actually lived in the camps and were exposed to the brutality of Nazi Germany.  On a softer note, the Island of Guernsey, even though it was occupied, seemed a lovely place to live.  Each story entwined with another, which made for a great read!!  Kudos to the author!!!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This was the first Blu-ray DVD set that i purchased after purchasing a Blu-ray player. What i experienced is beyond words. I am not sure how it looks when played from the normal DVD's, but i stunned at the crisp picture quality. The documentary itself is excellent and is a treat to watch. I watched the complete series more than a couple of times and i still feel that excitement. Planet earth will also serve as a great educational video for the kids who want to really know anything about our beautiful planet. Some of the visuals are stunning and beyond words. You wont regret it after you purchase it and you will really enjoy it.

B002T9H2L0|1.0|For those that have studied WWII, and unfortunately, seen real human brains on the ground, this movie is a travisty, a sadistic farce, and a coplete waste of time like most of Tarantinos other questionable work. I do admit to liking \\"Reservour Dogs\\" to a point. However, this thing does not even have an original title.    I unfortunately received this DVD by mistake and see this project as a new low for Brad Pitt and the other actors taking part in this joke of making jews more barbaric than the Nazis.  It perpetuates blame on the common German soldiers while covering up the major part US and UK bankers like Prescott Bush had in funding Hitler, as well as, the now confirmed part that British Intelligence had in bringing Hitler and Mussolini to power begiining immediately at the end of WWI.      WWII was a complex and tragic event, and the real world history deserves better than this self serving, mythological blood feast served up for fools too lazy to look for the truth, and try to prevent a reoccurance. History can repeat itself when we become manipulated by propaganda, desensitized to inhumane actions, and self righteous.

0321344758|5.0|Steve's book not only had some awesome usability concepts and practical advice and techniques, but I really liked the writing style as well and the examples given. It inspired me not only in our latest website design, but also in writing a few blog entries to my audience about \\"reudcing the clutter in their to-do lists\\" (similar to what Steve suggests in web pages) and I also worte an \\"e-mail to managers\\" who tend to interrupt their staff and hinder their productivity (similar to the e-mail that Steve has written to managers and executives who may interfere with usability unknowingly).

0446577383|1.0|This may be the worst book I have ever read, with the possible exception of crap porn when I was a kid. At least then there were no pretensions. I was expecting a New York Times best-selling author to deliver at least a story expressed in coherent English. I was so amazed by the awful writing that I would read a passage to my 15 year old and ask his opinion. He just laughed. The characters are comic-book idiots. I can only assume he's coasting.

B001NFNFNU|5.0|Clint Eastwood's thriller/drama \\"Changeling\\" is a tough film to sit through at times because of the subject matter it deals with (portrayed with aptly simple and understated touch, though). The extraordinary story of Christine Collins, which involves horrifying violence and injustice, is a bit long for some, but it remains compelling throughout without relying on sensationalism.    One of the greatest assets of the film based on the true events is, not surprisingly, Angelina Jolie and her strong performance as Christine Collins, whose 9-year-old boy Walter disappeared in Los Angels, in 1928. Five months later police Captain J.J. Jones (Jeffrey Donovan) in charge of the case announces that the boy was found in DeKalb, Illinois. However, Christine Collins is shocked to know that the \\"Walter\\" who shows up before her is not her son although the police and \\"Walter\\" himself claim that he is. But what really happened to Walter Collins?     Angelina Jolie ditches her Lara Croft image for a new role as a grief-stricken woman who continues to fight for what she loves. Michael Kelly is equally memorable as Detective Ybarra, who plays an important role in uncovering the horrible truths behind the missing case. But perhaps the real star is the city of Los Angles and Tom Stern's cinematography that vividly describes the world where Christine Collins and her son Walter lived.    \\"Changeling is another impressive achievement from Clint Eastwood, a powerful character-driven drama, bolstered with gifted actors, beautifully-shot cinematography and sure-handed direction.
0140042520|3.0|I first read this tale in the 60s when I was a young teenager. Then it was daring and exciting, and its eastern philosophy was fascinating and new.

The ride is great. Now if you follow Trek then i don't have to say a word. This movie has been picked apart at various Trek websites. Some love it and Some don't. I personally think it was cool. I had been waiting for any new Trek since Nemesis. So I'll take what I can get. I just had a hard time seeing anybody replace the original cast. I'm sure they will grow on me eventually. Except for maybe Sylar, Oh I mean Quinto. Every time I watch it I keep seeing Sylar in Spock. I guess i watch Heroes to much. Anyway I do recommend it. It was way better then the other 2009 summer movies. So boldly go check out the final frontier.

0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse-Five is an epic journey through time, space, and the human mind. On this journey the reader follows an unlikely hero, Billy Pilgrim, through his travels from Dresden to an alien planet, Tralfmadore, and back again--in no particular order. The events of the novel--though seemingly random--give an insight into the meaning of war, and the human experience. Though it is an antiwar novel, and is about the bombing of Dresden--one of the worst, if not the worst, bombings in history--it has a lighthearted tone, and does not really focus on the events of the bombing itself. The protagonist was actually underground during the bombings, and the reader only really sees the after-effects. Vonnegut's antiwar sentiment is not found in gruesome details of the horrors of war, but in the way he presents his views on choices and fate.        Billy learns--while on Tralfmadore--that time is not what he thinks it is, and that humans are, in a sense, timeless. Therefore, because time does not have a hold on people, what happens is decided more by fate than any choices they make. This presents an interesting viewpoint for a novel about war. It makes the reader wonder about the meaning of death, and war. If people would have been able to see the horror of the bombing of Dresden beforehand, does that mean that they would have done anything, or could have done anything to stop it? In this light, the question faced is, what then is the purpose of killing? If it truly means nothing, then why is it done? The author says that massacre's are meaningless, and then conveys this through his views on humanity in an interesting and incredibly intriguing style.        Reading the novel, Vonnegut seems to be throwing ideas and concepts randomly at the pages. It is difficult to follow, and needs to be really thought about to understand (I'm not even sure if I still understand it). The beauty of the message of the novel is found in so many strange details that do not seem to connect, but that somehow create a web of intertwining ideas and messages that, when looked at from afar, creates a picture of war as it truly relates to the human experience.
0321344758|5.0|The basic idea that I took from this book is that most people design for the web from a top down \\"how do we push this data out to everyone\\" and end up with unusable, hard to understand pages. When you flip the perspective and design from the web user point of view, and ask \\"how do I find this information,\\" you end up with something much much more usable and friendly to navigate.    Excellent book, easy to read, and extremely informative.

B00024I2Z4|5.0|My first exposure to this tale of Ancient China's girl warrior was from viewing a doll of the character featured on the Home Shopping Network sometime in the early 90s.   Little did I realize how much publicity there would soon be in the Western World for China's legendary forerunner to France's Jeanne D'Arc within just a few years!   The Disney animators have done a fine job of capturing  the  Chinese flavor of the story, and basing the layout on Ancient Chinese watercolor pictures. One feels the figures stepped  right off those delicate and antiquated sheets of paper, and in essence, became timeless.    Our story begins with the grim scenario of the Mongolian leader Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer)  and his troops  crossing over the newly constructed Great Wall of China to invade the country. The Emperor( Pat Morita) orders that conscriptions be formed by all Chinese men capable of serving.   Elsewhere, in a lovely province, the farm girl who will make a difference is preparing for a meeting with the village matchmaker(Miriam Margoyles). We first meet young Fa Mulan( voiced by Ming Na and sung by Lea Salonga) as she employs the service of her dog, \\"Little Brother\\" ( Chris Sanders) in helping her feed the chickens in an innovative way that goes awry, resulting in her father Fa Zhou's (Soon Tek Oh) praying even harder for the success of his awkward daughter on that day. Her mother Fa Li(Freda Foh Shen), and Grandmother Fa(voiced by June Foray, and sung by Marni Nixon) help prepare her by helping to dress and presenting her with good luck charms, including the little cricket, Cri-Kee(Frank Welker), whose name, I somehow have reason to believe, isn't as Chinese as it sounds...    Long story short, the visit with the matchmaker doesn't go well, and Mulan is in a funk about yet another failure despite her father's attempt to console her.    Soon messengers reach the village calling for them men to join the army. When Fa sees that her father, who has served before is physically unable to re-enlist, she ignores the fact that women caught serving in the army will be executed, stops listening to the voices that tell her she is forgetting her place as a woman, and does what her heart tells her is right, cutting her hair, taking her father's armour, and riding off one rainy night to serve in his place.    Pausing for a moment to find inspiration, and hoping for a guardian, Mulan will soon get her wish in the form of the little dragon Mushu( voiced by Eddie Murphy, without the \\"gai pan\\"), who despite the objections of the First Ancestor ( George Takei), and the other ancestors due to a past failure, takes it upon himself to see Mulan through the battle, along with little  Cri-Kee  and Mulan's horse, Khan( also voiced by Frank Welker).   What I found amusing about the ancestral tete-a-tete was that, having lived in Hawaii, with its large Chinese population they reminded me of people I knew when I was young.    Mulan soon arrives at the Army camp where she encounters the other recruits, including the feisty one-eyed Yao ( Harvey Firestein), the joker, Ling (Gedde Wantanabe), and the  gentle giant, Chein-Po (Jerry Tondo).She also deals with the officious official Chi Fu (James Hong), but is impressed by the strong young commanding officer Shang(voiced by B.D Wong and sung by Donny Osmond), whose father General Li (James Shigeta) is facing combat elsewhere.   While failing to make a good first impression, Mulan eventually inspires the men when she succeeds at the first test Shang gave the recruits.   Soon, we follow the troops on marches through the beautiful countryside, and see the evil Shan-Yu and his forces drawing closer.   Mushu and Cri-Kee either cover for Mulan, to prevent her from being exposed, or take matters into their own hands in altering the course of events.   The climax of this story is a dramatic confrontation with the Mongols in the snowy mountains, where Mulan discovers a way to cut the strength from behind Shan-Yu when the power of his forces seems overwhelming.   Wounded in battle after saving Shang's life, Mulan is soon discovered to be female. While Shang spares her as an act of reciprocity, he orders the troops to move out and he will have no more to do with her.    But Mulan's work isn't finished yet: Having seen the Huns pop out of the snow, she hurries to warn the men, who soon realize they must follow her lead in order to defeat Shan-Yu. The finale is spectacular, and she who saves China pretty much saves the world--or at least most of it.   What makes this a great story for children is that they see the imperfections of Mulan, Mushu, and Cri-Kee, but they can learn about perseverance in spite of past failures because these characters believe in themselves and their ability to do good.--A highly recommendable tale told with Oriental grace!

Apart from that, for all of those who´ve been to Lenoard Cohen´s 3-hour shows these past two years and for all of those who´ve missed it, this DVD is a real treasure to behold and to keep. Never has Mr. Cohen sounded better, backed up (as almost always) by a stellar backing band, including absolutely beautiful vocal harmonies by the amazing Webb Sisters from Britain and his long-time collaborator Sharon Robinson.     The sound back in the concert hall was brilliant, and this is pretty much what you get here on this DVD, no more, no less. As with with video quality, the sound on the DVD could have been so much better, but the performance and the music more than make up for the technical disappointments.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|Even though you can go through multiple setting changes to try, this blue ray does not work on play station 3.  It simply doesn't work. I've gone through exchanges and talked to others online.... it's a known problem.    It's a great movie.... just buy the DVD.
B001QOGYFY|5.0|Atmosphere as the title star always gets me. Soundstages and Canada look great as Antarctica. Pretty picture has Kate Beckinsale and Tom Skerritt as part of it's very slick production. Action-mystery in the style of a horror-mystery from 30s to 50s. Story is weak but thriller-lite ...which might bother many; but Dark House Films exist at this B level, and do it well. The bottom feeder in all of us are their target.  30 below, stuck in the snow, mystery in tow with a hot cop and script to go. Graphic Novel inspired<br />BD looks and sounds great but intentionally soft and mild with power moments. Overall; good looking

B001TOD92C|4.0|The Wrestler tells the story of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former wrestling superstar now at the end of his career and reduced to performing at small events for chump change.  The Ram lives in a trailer park and works part time stocking at a megastore.  His main focus at the beginning of the film is keeping his aging body in shape for the ring.  His life revolves around his workouts, visits to the gym, the tanning salon, and securing the drugs he needs to keep his pain and decay in check.  His only outside interest seems to be spending time at a strip club, where he has forged an awkward relationship with stripper Cassidy (Marisa Tomei).<br /><br />When Randy suffers a heart attack following a match, he is forced to reexamine his lifestyle and make some difficult choices concerning his future, both professional and personal.  He attempts to reach out to his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and seeks a deeper relationship with Cassidy (whose real name is Pam), and tries to forge a new life outside of the ring by attempting to work a regular job behind the deli counter at the megastore.<br /><br />The movie succeeds in its portrayal of the small independent wrestling scene.  The film uses actual wrestlers and locations, which really works to establish a real vibe.  The main appeal of the movie, however, is the performance of the three principle actors.  Without them, the story would be less compelling.  Rourke is simply outstanding as Randy, the aging warrior whose body is beginning to betray him.  Tomei shines as the single mother stripping to pay the bills, waiting for something better to come along.  And Evan Rachel Wood almost steals the show as Stephanie, Randy's college-aged daughter, trapped in a love-hate relationship with her often absent father.  The scenes between Rourke and Wood crackle with emotions, tender and volatile.<br /><br />The other thing I really admire about this film are the little details.  Randy drives a Dodge Ram van (natch), has an American flag (somewhat tattered) hanging behind his bed, listens to 80s hair metal, and wears reading glasses and a hearing aid when he's not in the ring.  He's Hulk Hogan if the Hulkster was broke and living on food stamps.  Small touches like this make Randy's world a very believable one.  The Wrestler is a well-drawn look at the downside of the American Dream, the downhill ride that sometimes follows success.  Even if you know nothing about wrestling, I highly recommend this picture, on the sheer strength of the acting performances alone.American flag (somewhat tattered) hanging behind his bed, listens to 80s hair metal, and wears reading glasses and a hearing aid when he's not in the ring.

B000PY30JE|5.0|CHET (Original Album Remastered) is absolutely first rate. Great tunes (Alone Together, 'Tis Autumn, It Never Entered My Mind, Time On My Hands, If You Could See Me Now (by Tad Dameron) to name just a few). Great lineup of musicians (Pepper Adams-Bari.Sax, Herbbie Mann-Flute, Bill Evans-Piano, Paul Chambers-Bass, Connie Kay & Philly Joe Jones-Drums and at the very still center of it is - Chet Baker. All instrumentals, no vocals. I'm a fan of Mr. Baker's playing and singing. To me, his music demonstrates that, quite simply put - music is about one thing and one thing only - BEAUTY. I believe that to be the at the very heart and soul of his music. Another reviewer sums up the beauty of this album as - \\" Masterful Minimalism.\\" Absolutely! There is a relaxed, spare and intimate grace to the music on this album that is for some reason rare in Jazz. On recordings, but not only. Most Jazz in clubs and on radio I find to be busy, aggressive, in your face. More than not its raucous, loud, and all too often not about the music but about noticing those who are playing the music, and their chops. And because of that, its uninvolving. This c.d. is a reminder of what counts most. It demonstrates a taste and economy that glistens throughout. Another name for that particular quality is Chet Baker. His magic infuses all the musicians on this album with a gold dust that Bill Evans also always had. And in this instance it tempers the the Sax of Mr. Adams. To sum it up - this is an album that can best be described in one word: BEAUTY. Highly recommended.

B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Incredible score - modern and period at the same time. Hats off to Zimmer for exquisite integration of violin and string section - of course one would think it would be an obvious thing to do with a Holmes score, but I was pleasantly surprised by the way he stretched the abilities of the string section - scraping the bow, synth high pitch 'rips', etc... the Holmes motif is a great addition to the score literature, passing the theme from glockenspiel to sythensizer / harmonium to banjo for the win. Instead of just a sitting on a simple tune for the opening or closing credits Zimmer and Ritchie utilize the score and motifs as a musical experession of Holmes' mental processes - brilliant in the film and still effective on the album.    The 'love' #be it for Adler or Watson# theme is effective and also holds potential to be carried over into sequels.     Agree with previous posts that the High Kings are sorely missed. Do yourself a favor a purchase the tune \\"Rocky Road to Dublin\\" and add it to your library as part of this soundtrack. While you are there, go ahead and get 'Maries Wedding' - another great High Kings track.

What I can't stand is that seasons 2 and 3 waste my time when I load a disk looking for the network connection (I've got better things to do with my time than hook up my Blu0ray to the Internet).  There should be a way to defeat that \\"feature\\"
B002MJV7JA|4.0|So I'll be the first to admit that season 1 is more entertaining than season 2...but I'll be completely honest here, this show could become the worst show on television and I'd still watch it. Luckily though, it's not the worst show on television. Season 2 is still great. The dvd however is lacking. Just as the first season on dvd, it is censored and lacking in extras. But for the price, I'd say it's worth the purchase.
B00275EGX8|1.0|My wife and I watched maybe 15 minutes and gave up. There was so much shaky camera work we were feeling sick. I will never understand the reasoning for filming a movie with all this unnecessary camera movement, panning around, rapid zooming in/out. It's like it was filmed by a 10 year old. I should have taken $25 and thrown it down the toilet!     Even the scenes where nothing was moving; the camera was bouncing around. This stuff absolutely sucks. I'd rate this a zero if it were possible.
0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is a well known American classic. It provides a look into the future, a peek into the past, and a narration of a portion of the present life of Billy Pilgrim, the protagonist and unlikely hero. Vonnegut took a creative risk by writing a novel that could be categorized as both science fiction and historical. In doing so, he created what could be considered one of the most innovative and successful works of literature of the modern age.   Vonnegut's main character, Pilgrim, has the ability to \\"come unstuck in time.\\" He has learned how to move in between memories of the past and visions of the future. The most vivid memories come from Pilgrim's time spent in the war. He has many horrific reminiscences of being herded into Dresden, which, through his time travels, he knew would be destroyed. Pilgrim also has \\"memories\\" of his time spent in the future on a planet called Tralfamadore, a planet where he is taken after he abducted by aliens who enjoy keeping him as a type of pet to study. Vonnegut smoothly transitions between these two sets of recollections by Therefore, Vonnegut's work seems less like choppy satirical anecdotes, and more like a fluid story.    In my opinion, Slaughterhouse Five succeeds in conquering the eternal question of time. Billy, unlike most people, is given the opportunity to not only reflect on the different parts of his life, but also relive them. Rather than focusing on living in his present life, though, Billy is constantly moving in and out of time in the search for why things are happening. He has been given a gift, but he is unable to take each moment as its own. He has to learn, like the Tralfamadorians already have, that the reason that something is happening is not important, it is just the fact that it is happening. Instead of thinking like and Earthling, Pilgrim must learn not to ask, as he does in the beginning: \\"Why you? Why us for that matter? Why anything?\\" and just accept that the answerto all his questions of time is merely: \\"Because this moment simply is.\\"
0385504225|4.0|Very good book.  Hard to put down.  Not quite as good as Angels and demons but still better than most books.
1601251505|5.0|This is a fat book that builds upon the strengths of D&D 3.5 while adding a certain amount of variety and flavor. It keeps it from being too fanciful and/or a clone of the Massive Multiplayer Online scene that D&D 4.0 seem to buy into.<br /><br />There are improvements on combat actions and handling. Great improvements on the standard classes, while making them fun and interesting to play from Levels 1-20. Progression doesn't \\"feel\\" stale as you progress, either. When you should be \\"uber powerful\\" there was a thin line of balance between killing everything in one blow to dying horribly in one blow. The effort to balance has made it more interesting to progress into \\"epic\\"-status adventures.<br /><br />The amount of content that exists from Paizo in the form of supplements and additions is also incredible. They fully support their product with new and updated materials to improve upon the system without making each book \\"an expansion pack\\" with overpowered abilities that you only have access to through new books. (Again, similar to how MMO's continue their branding and involve more investment to \\"get better stuff\\".)<br /><br />The book can be daunting, but if you're familiar with the layout, which is far better than the D&D 3.0~3.5 books, it progresses nicely in a linear \\"character building\\" way. There is something of a Dungeon Master's guide packed into the back of the book, too, making it a complete system in one book. I highly recommend \\"playing\\" to experience the book, since that is the best way to learn it.<br /><br />Overall, I _highly_ recommend this to any novice or experienced Pen and Paper RPGer. Enjoy the adventure!

B000059TEQ|1.0|Everyone in my family talked about what a great movie this was.  My cousin said it was the best movies she ever saw.  And hey, it was nominated for 7 Oscars including Best Picture of 1970. Of course, \\"Airport\\" was as well.  So I purchased this to add to my collection of 6,000 plus dvds.  This movie makes \\"Airport\\" , a classic stinker, look like \\"Gone With The Wind.\\"  It is so bad.  The acting is horrendous, the plot so cheesy.  I could not believe how bad this movie was.  The music, which I liked, was making me sick by the end. I swear if I ever hear Ali MacGraw say preppie again I will probably spontaneously combust.  Maybe things were different in 1970, but how this movie made so much money is astounding.  The one kick I got from this movie was seeing Tommy Lee Jones as O'Neals college roommate.

0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 delivers the tragic story of a wide variety of American soldiers during World War II in a way that is both heartbreaking and hilarious.        Similar to the way that Catch-22 doubles back on itself, the book's dialogue is loaded with endless double entendres and a unique style of speaking I will call \\"catch talk.\\" Many of the men, such as Yossarian, Orr, and Natalie all have conversation riddled with sexual innuendo. Catch talk most commonly occurs when Yossarian is present. When his commanding officers become furious with him and they attempt to punish him, Yossarian suggests that in order to avoid making the company look like it has insubordinate members the officers should simply promote him. The officers quickly write the idea off as ludicrous and continue trying to find a punishment for him. Soon, however, they realize on their own that punishing Yossarian would look bad for the company. Then one of the officers comes up with the brilliant plan to simply promote him and make the entire company forget about the issue. Thus, catch talk occurs. One party begins the argument arguing one way, and the talk then deviates to something different, but then reverts back to the original statement. This style of speaking catches the readers' attention and creates something unique that the reader can identify about the book.        Yossarian was one of the most original characters I have ever heard of. Playing the protagonist for a good portion of the book, he at times is also the antagonist, as he inhibits the goals of some of the other main characters. Similar to the looped idea of Catch-22, Yossarian can be quickly classified as one of the most insane people in the book (he curses himself for forgetting to bring his machine gun to the officer's club in order to massacre everyone). But on closer inspection, Yossarian is in fact one of the most sane people in the book. While all other officers act perfectly sane on the ground, they are considered insane because they ignore their instinct to survive in the air. Yossarian, on the other hand, acts insane while groundside but then is perfectly sane in the air. Everyone acts calm while flying, while Yossarian is panicky and wants nothing more than to get the hell out of the fight.        With its unique conversations and the one-of-a-kind Yossarian, Catch-22 was a hilarious and tragic adventure that gives a unique perspective on the war.
0061914177|4.0|I remember the first time I saw a video of @garyvee giving a keynote talk ( if you haven't watched one, you should, right now! here ), and I really didn't know what to think.    1st - is this guy on crack?    2nd - whoa, I've never thought about ______ that way. Or that. Or that...    3rd - this might be half way insane, but he's passionate, driven, and genuine.    So naturally when I heard he was writing a book, I was eager to check it out, although I was skeptical that it would be engaging all the way to the end.    I'm happy to say I read the whole thing, and enjoyed all of it! Know that it was a nice and brief weighing in under 140 pages!    The content was a really good mix of gary's personal story, a motivational punch in the mouth ( the good kind of course, that get you riled up and in arms ), and practical real life advice on how to use specific tools like Twitter and facebook to share your passion.    Although I enjoyed hearing his story most, running a close second was the honesty with which Gary approaches advice on using social media tools. Instead of claiming to be a \\"social media expert\\", he starts with the fundamentals of one knowing your passion & your DNA, and then offers some take them or leave them tips / best practices on specific tools.    Though I don't agree with Gary on a number of finer points, I could not agree more with his core message:    Find your passion. Craft your presentation medium. And never forget that content is king.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|The product was just NOT what I expected.  I was originally sold on all the fancy audio features, but I was also seeking a simple connection and the devil is in the details.  This headset is wired and that's fine.  But the end connection splinters into 2 audio jacks and 1 USB connection.  It turns out the the headset uses the USB for power and microphone output to the PS3, but uses the RCA jacks coming out of the PS3 for input audio.  Seemingly, users are supposed to hook up this headset in a permanent configuration.  I was looking for a headset that I could use while gaming and unplug and store at all other times.  Also, the USB connection fits way too loosely in my brand new PS3.<br /><br />I can't knock the headset too much (thus the 2 stars instead of one) because Turtle Beach provides the user guide on their website ([...]) like a good vendor should.  I didn't search for the manual BEFORE I purchased and opened the package and I should have.
0739366408|3.0|I can easily see this book becoming a new \\"cult classic.\\" You know, the type of book which is worshiped by teenage boys and young guys in their 20s. The type of book they maul over for hours, discussing all different ways of killing zombies, the new (zombie) war strategies, or, if they are of a smarter bunch, looking for analogies between current political and economical events and those in the book. Well, you get the picture...<br /><br />Not that I don't appreciate Brooks' novel approach to a dead-beat zombie story. I liked his attempt to write a book which is based on exploring the influence of political climate on the way the zombie epidemic is handled. I just honestly expected this \\"oral history\\" to be more relatable. I expected some actual accounts of survival, something to sympathize with, someone to feel sorry for. Instead I got a series of interviews that delivered in a somewhat lecture tone a rather dry account of war tactics, political crises, various strategies with dealing with the zombie war aftermath, etc. Basically, Brooks produced what he was supposedly attempting to avoid in the introduction to the book - cold hard data, albeit told by multiple narrators instead of on the pages of a report.<br /><br />I don't know, maybe something got lost in abridgment (I listened to a well done audio version of the book), something that would have made this book come alive for me. Or maybe I am just not the target audience. It was a moderately interesting book, with some original ideas, but ultimately it left me cold and uninvolved.

006621131X|5.0|This is a tender memoir by Patti Smith of her early years, as she searches for an identity as an artist/writer/poet/performer in 1970's new York City.  Her loving relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe, her life at the famed Chelsea Hotel, her meetings with the artists, the junkies, the crazies, and the blessed who wandered through the Village during the era of change in the 1970's is revealed to us.  Patti lived amidst a swirl of creative primordial ooze - meeting Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Sam Sheppard, Lenny Kaye, and so many others.      She reveals herself as an innocent kid, coming from a simple, middle-class and loving home who braved the Big Apple for better or worse. It is a wonderful inside glimpse into Patti's metamorphosis, told with acceptance and love.  Those who may have only heard Patti Smith perform as an outspoken tough-girl will marvel at the tender heart that beats inside that slender body. Those who know her better, recognize parts of ourselves.  I loved this book!
1416562605|2.0|Some books very clearly take themselves far too seriously. The navel-gazing novel 'The White Tiger' isn't quite one of those, but it definitely put me in that mindset. It has its moments of insight and genuine humor, but for the most part it seems more interesting in making a point than in telling a story.<br /><br />The narrator, a driver and self-titled \\"social entrepreneur\\" named Balram, strikes a single self-important tone through the whole story - what story there was. It honestly reads more like a travel book than a novel, eager and exaggerated. The story struck me as a simple device to explore a seedy underworld of India.<br /><br />I understand that this book tells the story of an underdog, someone suffering in unbearable conditions and taking action against it. Frankly, though, I think there are better examples, and the narrator spends far more time complaining and detailing his degradation than he does doing anything about it. His actions, in the end, are rash and predictable, and don't bring anything truly new or unique to the table.<br /><br />There is far more style than substance to be had in 'The White Tiger,' and unfortunately not enough of either to make it a memorable book for me.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|The ears of my childhood and early teens heard the Beatles and rock'n'roll in the mono era, and later embraced the miracle of stereo.  Despite my tremendous anticipation upon learning of the impending re-engineering of the Beatles' catalog, I resisted impulse and mulled over many of the excellent reviews that followed the remastered releases, pleasantly obsessing for months over whether to buy the mono or stereo boxed set.  (Oh, and perhaps waiting for the price to drift a little closer to Earth, too.)  I settled on the mono set, mainly because it covers the recordings the way the Fab Four conceived of being heard.  I just received the set today and am completely happy.  Aside from adding to the chorus of acclaim and appreciation for the new masters in general, I'd like to corroborate an assertion made in one or more of the reviews, which I initially viewed with skepticism: that despite being 'mono', a stereo image can be heard in the pristine recordings if one listens for such.  From my 'mono' days, I just didn't remember that being the case, and as an audiologist, I had my doubts that such a percept could live in a mono waveform.  After listening to just the first album in mono, I testify that 'stereo' images are there to be heard just as plain as day.  You don't even have to work at hearing the spatial relationships of the voices and instruments--they are obvious.  (In fact they are so stark that I momentarily wondered if we are being toyed with by the new engineers!)  I believe I recall a reviewer's analogy about a very good black and white photograph having tremendous depth and beauty.  This is a good comparison.  The mono recordings do not have the wide impression of a modern stereo field, but the warmth and aural positioning the of the sounds in the mix are enormously satisfying.  I don't think anyone needs \\"60's\\" credentials to hear it. Enjoy!  An afterthought: I should mention that I'm listening with 20 to 30-year-old stereo components that are not particularly great, but nevertheless are real audio system devices intended for a hi-fi experience.  I have absolutely NO idea what the experience would be with ordinary computer audio or mini-audio systems that are popular today.

B000AP04L0|3.0|A pretty silly but good natured comedy with a vague underlying moral message of some sort.

I also can admit that if he never rose up the ranks, then I would have never heard of this book. The struggles of bi-racial children are often left untold. The conflict in a world that chooses you to pick sides is almost unbearable. Barack tells his story with flair and charm and a sense of aloofness. It is a shame that black fathers tend to not stick with their children in bi-racial relationships. I understand the strain that can cause these conditions, but the abandoned child is often the one bearing the most weight. I have seen many young men who are in Barack's predicament veer off on the wrong path. Thank goodness that he did not. As bi-racial children become more prominet, we may truly understand their lot in life. Hopefully that means not having to pick sides!! Check out my book--Plain Talk on Racism and Stereotypes.

0439023483|4.0|It was a boring Sunday afternoon-the kind where everything is boring except reading-so I chose a random book off my top shelf and I had The Hunger Games in my hand. 45 minutes later, I've ended up sitting here writing this review.        The story is set in Panem, a post-apocalyptic nation, erected over the ruins of North America.   Post-apocalyptic. Say that five times fast! But really, the setting is nice. It also has one of those twisted and warped storylines that everyone loves.        Ok, first we have a girl named Katniss. Collins has done a great job on her books but, Katniss? And it actually says in the book that katniss is the name of a plant with edible roots.(I think she'd have learned her lesson in weird, hard to pronounce names, after Bartholomew of Sandwich and Photos Glow-Glow in The Underland Chronicles.) \\"chuckles\\" Remember, Katniss has edible roots.       Well anyway, we have Katniss and a boy named Peeta (Peeta the potato.). Katniss Everdeen is the main character and narrator of the story. The sixteen year old girl hunts to provide for her mother and twelve year old sister in place of her dead father. Prim, Katniss's sister, is also named after a plant. Peeta Mellark is the strapping sixteen year old son of the town baker. He's about as useless as a lump of dough... oh! except for making bread.       Katniss and Prim live in the Seam, while Peeta lives in the town. District 12 is consisted of the poor and dirty Town, the poorer and dirtier Seam, the Meadow which is separated from the Seam and town by a partly-electrified fence, and a dangerous forest beyond the Meadow.       Every year, on the Reaping, a boy and a girl from each of the 12 Districts are selected to be tributes for the Hunger Games. At the end of each game only one tribute can win. This is a play on the Greek myth of Theseus, in which the city of Athens was forced to send young men and women to Crete to be devoured by the Minotaur. For Collins, this was an  inspiration for the nation of Panem; she explains, \\"Crete was sending a very clear message: 'Mess with us and we'll do something worse than kill you. We'll kill your children.'       During the Games Katniss meets Rue,(my fave character) a young girl who reminds her of Prim. She allies with Rue who proves to be helpful, but dies while helping with Katniss's plan to kill the Career tributes. (Just bad luck?) And apparently, Rue is also named after a small plant. She also meets Cato, Glimmer and Clove(another small plant!)-the Career tributes-none of whom are exactly friendly to her.       I recommend this book to ages 13+. It would be suitable for 10-12 -except for a whole lot of death, brutal violence, more death, pain, death, gore, and being eaten alive-which is a type of death.... sorry for the sarcasm but there is a lot of death. (I just used the word 'death' 6 times.)       To sum up this book, I'd say that Collins is cooking a meal. The first dish is soup, a culinary mix of minced action, steamed mystery, boiled romance, grilled deception, a pinch of friendship and reality TV, and whole bucket of edible plants. And from the look of it the second course is close to barbecued chicken. Click for the second book.[[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] (Don't forget to finish reading my review!)       If I was Suzanne Collins, I could have named this book: 'A Garden Guide to Edible Plants' But I'm not and if I was I wouldn't be able to write this good in a hundred years. (No offense, Mrs. Collins, I REALLY loved your book.)
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Superb performance at the royal albert hall (london). Great scenery to inmortalize one of the best groups of the moment.
B00104QSOM|5.0|At the end of 2009, critics began releasing their \\"Best Films of the Decade\\" lists and There Will Be Blood was number one for both Peter Travers and Michael Phillips, among others. It would be to bold of me to call this one of the decade's best films, but what director Paul Thomas Anderson has created with There Will Be Blood is a big, grand film rarely seen today with a towering performance by its star Daniel Day-Lewis.     I do not need to divulge the plot to you. Day-Lewis plays oilman Daniel Plainview and Paul Dano plays fire-and-brimstone preacher Eli Sunday. I could describe the plot for you, but it's unnecessary, not simply because you likely already know about it but because this is a film that is not about plot...It's about evoking time, character, and emotions. No dialogue is spoken in the film for the first 14 minutes and it's remarkable what Anderson is able to express simply through images.    Paul Thomas Anderson, never without ambition, was at his most ambitious with this film. Working with a vast landscape and a brilliant cinematographer (Robert Elswit, who won an Academy Award for his work here), Anderson easily evokes the early 1900s that a man like Plainview would inhabit and he doesn't mind taking a moment to linger on the vast setting he's working with. Jonny Greenwood's musical score is so unique and fits this film so well; it's larger-than-life, epic, and sinister. Anderson immerses his audience so completely into this time, this atmosphere, and it's Greenwood's score dictates the mood...It's masterfully made, but it's not just the workings behind the camera that made this film receive its acclaim.    Daniel Day-Lewis won his second Academy Award for this film and rarely has an actor delivered a screen performance of this caliber. This is a performance that transcends mere acting, where Day-Lewis is (and not for the first time) not just playing Daniel Plainview but becoming the man. It's much more of a transformation than a performance and it's one of the more fascinating performances I've ever seen. The voice, mannerisms, and the insanity he's capable of expressing with a single look is remarkable. Hardly anything Day-Lewis brings to this character suggests he's acting and it's no small feat to make such a towering, larger-than-life figure wholly believable and real. Who else could have brought such intensity and believability to the \\"milkshake\\" speech?     Dano is effective too as both Paul Sunday and Eli Sunday and he stands his ground against Day-Lewis. There isn't a weak link anywhere in the performances, but it's Day-Lewis' show and he keeps his stranglehold on it throughout.    There Will Be Blood is only three years old, but it can already be evaluated as timeless. There's such a grand scope of creative vision at work here that the film's faults (if it has any) can't be picked up on with the naked eye. The film is a masterpiece, one that grows richer with repeat viewings and it's one of the few films I know will still be watched and discussed thirty years from now.     GRADE: A
B0001ADAVK|3.0|Woman power is the theme here. Though set in 1953, most of the Seven Sisters colleges, including Wellesley, still promote this brand of education: making women feel as if they can run the world. And why not? Only here, the art history professor is a little ahead of her time with the feminist protocol. Not much plot. The cast of 20-somethings is pretty good, and the film has some emotional moments. Julia Roberts is made to look ahead of her time style-wise. It's kind of a throwback movie to Hollywood glamor days. Guys will be able to get through it without too much fuss.

142813994X|5.0|I've just at this exact moment finished reading this spectacular book. I am planning on giving myself a couple of weeks to let all of the invaluable information the King of Horror so graciously offers sink in, and I will undoubtedly then reread the entire book.<br /><br />I was looking for good books on writing, and this one kept popping up on every list. I was terribly suspicious, as I am technically not a huge King fan, but having said that, I believe I've probably read or seen the adaptation of more than half of his work which is more than I can say for most authors. However, when I pulled the pinkish book from between the metallic, embossed horror paperbacks it was shelved and studied the contrasting images- a frightening cellar surrounding by pansies?, I was sold.<br /><br />The book is split into two sections. The first section, suitably titled, C.V. is just that, a biography. I was initially a bit perplexed at King's point, but that thought was unimportant because the C.V. is interesting. One of my favorite passages King retells is the day he is notified that the paperback rights to Carrie sold for $400,000. In this beginning section King talks about his early life, his marriage, his addictions, his mother and her illness. And, if you're paying close attention, at each stage of his life, he is writing.<br /><br />The second part of the book is priceless for writers. It is inspiring, intoxicating, thrilling and above all completely informative. King breaks through the conventions we are taught in high school and even college, rips them apart and reworks them. For example, he uproots the notion of the muse as a beautiful woman, and turns him into a cigar-smoking, basement dwelling bowling champion with a bag of magic that you ain't gettin' your hands on until you put in the long hours.<br /><br />King also covers dialogue, theme, grammar, description, rewriting and revising, research and so much more. On Writing also includes a postscript detailing King's horrific and near-fatal accident in 1999. Once again, this section is as much about writing and the writing process as it is about the accident and his recovery.<br /><br />This terrific book has made me a maniac about reading and writing. Because, in the end the theme is an inspirational one: You can be a better writer, just read a bunch, write a WHOLE bunch and most importantly, always tell the truth.1999.

1576754227|5.0|Eat that Frog is about discovering what is important and necessary for you as well as how to juggle all the other areas in life that also require attention. He does not attempt to diagnose one's nature of avoidance but simply to do when you find yourself not doing what you should. I think the book should be read anytime you think of procrastinating. Stop, take out paper, and write out your map. We all lose focus when emergencies come up but it does not mean we are helpless.     Definitely, get this book! It will not waste your time but get you moving in that right direction!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have to say that I felt a little bit mixed when I first heard that they were going to revamp the original Star Trek. 'How can they improve on perfection?' I wondered. I'd put off seeing this in theaters because the purist in me was too afraid of disliking the movie just because it was a remake. A year later, I finally give the movie a chance.<br /><br />To the fanboys & fangirls out there, give the movie a chance. No, it's not the original Star Trek, but something new & almost as exciting. I'm not going to give a synopsis since there's over a hundred other reviews on here on this DVD alone. I just have to say that I liked what they did with the movie.<br /><br />I liked that they made this into a separate universe from the original series. (Not really a spoiler since most reviews & promotional material state this.) It gives me a guilt-free way to enjoy the series without making me compare the characters unfavorably. Sure, I still compared the characters but now it could be done in a way that marked how differently they all developed. I chalked up the vastly different personalities to how the alternate universe affected each person individually. An Uhura/Spock pairing wasn't exactly what I would have chosen, but it was interesting.<br /><br />The only real gripe I'd have with the movie is that they did seem to want to cram as much action into the film as humanly possible. I sat back & enjoyed all of the eye candy, but once in a while I just hungered for something that wasn't *big awesome fight scene* or \\"OMG! AN EXPLOSION!!\\".<br /><br />The special effects are incredibly done & I really do wish that I'd seen this in the theaters while I had the chance. My puny tv screen really doesn't do it justice. I also liked the acting, especially by the girl who played Uhura. I loved the original Uhura & this movie made me love the new girl just as much.<br /><br />Take it from a die-hard fan, this movie rocked. Do I love it more than the old stuff? Nah, I'd still take original Kirk over the new guy, but you can't deny that this film was awesomely done.n't deny that this film was awesomely done.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|\\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" contributed at its time very much to widen the scope of what a pop / rock band could play and it also helped breaking down barriers between different musical genres.<br /><br />Today, when this more or less is taken for granted, the album probably appears less significant than in 1967 when it was first released. Some of the tracks have with time partially lost some of the appeal they originally had. Looking soberly at the music today some tracks are really not that interesting. George Harrison's \\"Within You, Without You\\" is very accomplished, but it is also very typical of its time. I suspect that many listeners today choose to skip the number.<br /><br />The same could apply to \\"She's Leaving Home\\", which has interesting lyrics, but which musically is rather dull.<br /><br />The album is probably the first with McCartney as the dominant vocalist - and his songs are generally great. \\"Getting Better\\" and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" have always been among my favorites, and both tracks have a lot of the old Beatles sound intact. The same can be said about \\"Lovely Rita\\". I've never been crazy about \\"When I'm 64,\\" but I must nevertheless acknowledge that it has become a classic - but it is not rock'n roll at any level..<br /><br />Lennon's strongest contributions are \\"A Day in the Life\\" and \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\". I feel that \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" often has been overestimated, while \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" is okay, but no more.<br /><br />The two title tracks are both very charming and always a pleasure to listen to.<br /><br />Ringo's singing on \\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\" could well be his best Beatles vocal performance.<br /><br />A milestone and also a great Beatles album.
0385737424|3.0|I was eager to read this book, having read a lot of positive press about it.  I'm a teacher librarian and eighth grade English teacher who happens to be doubtful that this text would engage many of my students, especially--as others have noted--boys.  First of all, I do think that that knowledge of A Wrinkle in Time is critical for a full understanding of the themes of Stead's book. Even with that book in one's \\"schema\\" backpack, however, When You Reach Me may still not engage.  It is a quiet book and I don't think there IS enough action to \\"grab\\" many grade 4-8 students. Those who do hang on might be curious as to how Marcus actually does travel through time--no hints are supplied. I'd say Nancy Etchemendy's Power of Un is a far stronger read. I'm frankly surprised that Stead's book won The Newbery.  However, that it did so tends to confirm a phenomenon much discussed over the last year or so: how relevant and appealing the award winners actually are to the children they are supposedly written for.

0385341008|5.0|Over my 39 years, I have read tens of thousands of books, and I must confess, I only bought this one because it was part of a \\"Buy Two, get One Free\\" deal.  I did not want to read it, thinking it to be one of those stories about old Southern Ladies (I like those books, but was not in the mood for one).  Boy was I in for a surprise!<br />This book made me laugh out loud, weep tears of joy, and tears of grief for characters that came to life in a relatively short period of time (the book is not very long).<br />The story is about a 32 year old writer who is living in London after the war.  She wrote a series of humorous columns during the war, about the war, which was turned into a book, and at the beginning she is writing to her friend and editor Sidney Stark about how she does not want to go on the book tour and how she is searching for a topic for a new book.  I should note that the entire book is a series of letters back and forth from Juliet Ashton (the writer) and her friends.<br />One day a letter comes from the island of Guernsey, from a man named Dawsey.  He had come into posession of one of Juliet's books by Charlie Lamb, and he describs a bit about how he came to have it, and so introduces Juliet to the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and the reality of living under German occupation in the Channel Islands during World War II.<br />I am so glad this book was on sale!!!! It is a wonderful read.  It has something for everyone, including a little history.  I would put this in my all time top ten books I have ever read and this is saying a lot.

B000059TFO|5.0|In 1964 three civil rights workers from the North disappear in a small Mississippi town and the FBI are sent to investigate. Agent in charge Alan Ward does everything by the book. Agent Rupert Anderson however was a Sheriff in Mississippi before joining the FBI and understands the local culture. He's also prepared to bend the rules a bit if it will help in the investigation. They focus on the Sheriff's office and Deputy Clinton Pell in particular as they think he may be the weakest link in the conspiracy. As the investigation intensifies however, the KKK launch a series of attacks against the local African-American population. With no one on either side prepared to talk, Ward agrees to Anderson using his own unorthodox methods to learn what happened that night and who killed the three men. Mississippi Burning is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is important and it is entertaining and really  has something to say.
B000TBJQTG|5.0|Many superlatives have been said about The Beatles 'final album \\"Abbey Road\\" and there is no doubt that the praise is deserved and that the album is among the Beatles' very best. After the partial uninspired \\"Let it Be\\" sessions the group decided to end their cooperation with a really worthy release.<br /><br />Lennon, who was perhaps the one that was most tired of the role of a Beatle, contributed by two powerful blues-inspired songs \\"Come Together\\" and \\"I Want You\\". On both tracks the group really demonstrates tight competent playing, and the new remastered release is a true pleasure to listen. Espcially the close vocal harmonies and inspired guitar playing by both Lennon and Harrison all over the album.<br /><br />Harrison's two songs on the album both belong among his strongest compositions. \\"Something\\" became a hit single and \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" is a classic that has been recorded in countless cover-versions.<br /><br />McCartney's \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" and \\"Oh Darling\\", both fine songs in their own right, have probably also been some of the most criticized. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" to be silly and a little too \\"old school\\". \\"Oh Darling\\" might seem a bit like an anachronism, with its strong inspiration from old R & B tracks such as \\"Raining in My Heart\\".<br /><br />Ringo's \\"Octopus'Garden\\" appears somewhat as a children's song, but it is actually a nice melody that is both very well arranged and well produced.<br /><br />Lennon appears on the last number before \\"Abbey Road - Suite\\" from his soft side with \\"Because\\", which has some very nice vocal parties.<br /><br />The rest of the album consists mainly of shorter numbers which are inventively more or less tied together. In reality it is probably the \\"Abbey Road - Suite\\", which does that one never really gets tired of this album. The suite includes an abundance of delicate pieces of melody, beautiful vocal harmonies, dazzling instrumental playing and not least, it appears unusually inspired. From \\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\" to the last stanzas of \\"The End\\" one is so much enthralled by the Beatles. There is no doubt that many groups have been strongly inspired by the way this band were able to bind different genres and melody pieces together into a meaningful whole.<br /><br />Without saying too much, there is probably little doubt that the 10CC and Badfinger (Wish You Were Here) have retrieved much inspiration on this album.of \\"The End\\" one is so much enthralled by the Beatles.

055321263X|5.0|Wilkie Collins created a fantastic novel which could be read in the manner that most of the reviewers have interpreted this book.  Boy meets a mystery woman, falls in love with a look-alike who is forced to marry an evil man and eventually the woman in white reveals some secrets and conveniently dies.  The early lovers reunite with the help throughout the book of the sensible sister. What really happened?  This book was not written by one narrator, but many narrators with conflicting agendas. What if we assume that all are slanting their narratives to mislead the reader?  Who is telling the truth?    When you ask these questions and dig into the motivations and backgrounds of each of the narrators and characters, a very different story may emerge limited only by the imagination of the reader, but guided by Wilkie Collins.  Were the accidental deaths accidental?  Remember who was the narrator describing the accidental deaths.  Were the good guys serial murderers, so they could inherit all the wealth in the end? What was the real relationship of the three heroes?  These questions haunted me while reading the book and re-reading the book. I challenge anyone to re-read The Woman in white and question the motive and the story of each narrator as if you were attending an inquest or a trial.  Did the narrators cleverly hide the truth from the reader?      I have never read such an intriguing novel
B002VKE0XA|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie but it was not as \\"Scary\\" as I thought it would be based on the reviews. I found the footage and special effects to be of a high quality and unlike The Blair Witch Project (which was the pitts), my attention was kept throughout the movie. This film was very true to the life and reactions of normal people if these things were going on around them. Good movie, but if your a true \\"SCARY\\" movie lover, this film is not going to make you scared to be alone in your house.

Miyagi seems more interested in having Daniel paint fences and wax cars than teaching him Karate. \\"The Karate Kid\\" has to be appreciated for its nostalgia trip back to \\"better times.\\" For that reason alone, this movie is a classic. I highly recommend this movie.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|As most of my previous reviews would suggest, I normally am a listener to all forms of metal but Radiohead is, and has always been, one of those exquisite exceptions to the rule.    I've been listening since the mid 90's, have all their albums, and I can, with maybe only a second's hesitation, state that In Rainbows may very well be Radiohead's finest moment.  Even over the epic OK Computer, you might ask.  Yessir.  What about Kid A?  Again, yep.  Surely not The Bends, that hallmark of alternative rock.  Yup.  All three are great and I mean them absolutely no disservice by saying this stands a tick above all (so don't get pissy with me for saying it).    As much as I love music I can't describe in the same way as others might why I think this is their best so I won't try to fake anything (you'd see through that anyway).  I respond to music emotionally, not technically, and while I may hear what is technically going on I don't really understand it, so take my opinion with the proverbial grain of salt.  To me, In Rainbows is the perfect collection of simple, unadulterated love songs, especially concerned with that oh so universal feeling of unrequited love.  For a group to have collected ten songs that are so heart-wrenching yet gentle and warm without coming across as being cliche is beyond marvelous, and I stand in awe each time I hear the album, which brings me to my next point, which is there is not one single misstep here.  Even Faust Arp, which could be seen as a throwaway on a lesser record, is perfectly placed between All I Need and Reckoner.  Jigsaw Falling Into Place might be the best song Radiohead have recorded and closer Videotape, with its minimalistic sound, could be their best closer since Street Spirit.    Radiohead is what 'alternative' was meant to be, something different than the mainsteam, a term which unfortunately has been subjugated by the latter, its meaning gone.  In Rainbows, the seventh studio album from this untouchable band, further cements their status as masters of their craft and truly without peer.
B002RXHW6S|1.0|We purchased this bouncer for our boys for Christmas.  The 3 year old was so excited he could hardly contain himself.  We inflated it according to instructions on Tuesday.  By the following Monday it was flat.  Our 3 year old is only 31 pounds and his brother, 15 months, is only 20 pounds.  No other children were in the bouncy.  They did not wear shoes or bring any toys in the bouncer.  We refilled it and tried to patch the hole.  The hole is on a seam so my engineer husband believes it is poor workmanship that caused the hole not an external factor.  I have tried contacting Intex twice over a 2 week period but have not received a reply despite their website promising a reply within 2 business days.  I did not expect this toy to last for years, but I did expect it to last for more than one week.
B002BSHXJA|3.0|I've owned many of these tracks on mono either on import vinyl or the UK EP Box set.  My first thought when listening to this was that it sounded muddy.  So I compared it to the EP Box set, and I couldn't believe the difference.  The old box set is clearer and has more bottom end.  On only a few tracks does this win.  I suppose it's nice to have the packaging.  Even if you do buy this, the EP box set is still available on Amazon for around $100.  Buy them both and compare for yourself.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I have to agree with some of the other reviews that state that this series builds up from season 1 into a much better series. If you get dismayed with the first few episodes please stick with it for a few more. By Season 2 Fringe has become a truly great series. The cast has melded together and found their niche. Oddly enough my favorite characters aren't always the leads. For instance; The lovely Astrid (assistant to Walter) is featured much more prominet in Season 2 and I'm finding her to be quite an engaging character. It seems the public and writers agree with that assessment too, as she is featured more and more. So, if you are looking for an exciting series and love your Sci-fi stuff I highly recommend Fringe. Just remember it does start off kinda slow...but by mid season 1 and into season 2 it's become one of my favorite Sci-fi shows.

Now, here is the way I see it:    I purchase CD's above all to have a pleasant listening experience. And at the end, a CD is good if a play it again and again. James Horner, like Hans Zimmer has his own style. He might not be as creative as he was before to some, and maybe that's true, but you can really feel the effort behind this soundtrack; there is no such thing as a bad song in here. Some notes remind you of Titanic, some flutes, remind you of Zorro or Braveheart, but there are new elements, new melodies, new instruments and this is definitely not a mediocre job.    AGAIN: If you like The Legend of Zorro, Titanic and Braveheart, you wil find that using these good ingredients, James Horner has created some pleasant and aobve average score. The highlights are:    The Bioluminescence of the Night, Becoming one of \\"the people\\"/Becoming one with Neytiri, Climbing up \\"Iknimaya\\" and, in my opinion the best, Jake's First Flight.    Thanks for reading this and hope it was helpful!
0307277453|1.0|Light on science and heavy on anecdotal narrative. I didn't need to read about unearthing the fossil and was much more interested in the theory. If you're looking for a 'toilet book', or a book that isn't too thought-provoking; this might be the book for you. I imagine he got a book deal because the discovery was so profound, but doubt that it was because he had a great story to tell.
B000P0J0A6|5.0|When Billy Peltzer is given a small creature called a Mogwai by his father, he is unaware of the carnage he is about to encounter. There is a huge responsibility in looking after Gizmo as there are certain rules which must be followed. The Mogwai must be kept away from bright light, never made wet and never, ever be fed after midnight. When an accident occurs involving Gizmo and water, the next evolution stage of the Mogwai appears, and it isn't nice at all. Gremlins is a fantastic comedy movir from 1984. It's funny seeing the Gremlins cause mischief but it's also scary throughout-they're not exactly pretty creatures and are quite scary as well. This was one of Joe Dante's first movies and you can tell that everything he grew up with and movies he studied as a child are on-screen in Gremlins. A perfect movie made by the right director.
B0000VCZKM|4.0|Did the reviewer who wrote that this film is 'charmless' see the movie? It is a really great film, solid acting and a gorgeous voice from the little girl playing Annie. Needless to say Carol Burnett is outstanding and hilarious, and her duet with Daddy Warbucks is just great.
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The series is very entertaining.  It's a shame that HBO canceled it after only 2 seasons.  I don't really care for the packaging.  It looks nice, like a book, but the sleeves aren't very protective of the discs and you have to slide them out, risking scratches.
B001P22HK8|1.0|I was interested in this book after I read about the authors second book.  As I am an avid reader I decided to start with his first book.  I read the sample and while it was pretty technical I though the subject was interesting.  Once I had purchased the book it suddenly went from a young man stealing personal information off the internet to arranging a RAVE party with drugs and a sexual story that was being played over the internet.  I realize that this is another possible use of computer crime but it really didn't follow the story up to that point. I was disappointed and read no further. In reading some of the other comments that there was a very poor ending I don't intend to go back to the book and try it again, and will remove it from my kindle.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|Set in 1935, a professor, archaeologist, and legendary hero by the name of Indiana Jones is back in action in his newest adventure. But this time he teams up with a night club singer named Wilhelmina \\"Willie\\" Scott and a twelve-year-old boy named Short Round. They end up in an Indian small distressed village, where the people believe that evil spirits have taken all their children away after a sacred precious stone was stolen! They also discovered the great mysterious terror surrounding a booby-trapped temple known as the Temple of Doom! Thuggee is beginning to attempt to rise once more, believing that with the power of all five Sankara stones they can rule the world! Now, it's all up to Indiana to put an end to the Thuggee campaign, rescue the lost children, win the girl and conquer the Temple of Doom. The movie itself is a non-stop action, adventure ride. Harrison Ford is once again amazing as the dashing professor/archaeologist thrill seeker. A spectacular movie.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|This movie is THE BEST horror movie i've seen yet, the descent and silent hill, two of the best i've seen, dont even come close. Just imagine hell on earth, where things get so bad that the \\"supposed and only\\" way out was stirring down the barrel of a revolver. It reminds and teaches a lesson that no matter how  \\"hellish\\" life may be, we should fight for it. If you're a horror/suspense/thriller movie fan, DO NOT MISS THIS.

0810970686|5.0|My daughter is in 2nd grade and \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" books have been very popular among the kids in her grade, especially when we had our first book fair of the new school year.  She loves to read so she couldn't wait to start reading all of them in the series. Her teacher also recommended these books.  I purchased three more books in the series this Christmas and she was so excited.  These books are a great way to spark an interest in reading, and hopefully keep the interest ongoing.

The youngest daughter has some doubts as to the sincerity of the new uncle Fester. The fake uncle adapts very well to the strange family.

0385504225|1.0|I read \\"The Lost Symbol\\" out of curiosity about what Dan Brown would write about the Washington, D. C. area and the Masons, and to see what the storyline was this time.  Admittedly I had very low expectations, and they were fulfilled.    *Robert Langdon has even less personality than before-his most important personal characteristics are his claustrophobia and wearing a Mickey Mouse watch. The other characters are Brown's boilerplate cast with different names and nationalities.  Over-the-top villain described in disgusting detail.  I like some relation to reality in my fiction-the villain's ability to disguise himself was too unbelievable.  The wig camera is a hoot.  *The \\"OMG\\" tone of the characters' thoughts, except where they are ponderous and self-righteous-bad, bad writing.    *The whole book seemed pointless.  It's never clear exactly what Langdon's looking for.  There's the lost word, and the map to the Ancient Mysteries, and the Ancient Mysteries themselves (which are theoretically not lost at all, if they're contained in the sacred books of the world's religions). No lost symbol.  The villain already knew the location of the Masonic pyramid.  Using the severed hand as a puzzle map for Langdon is just another \\"Look how bad I am\\" moment.    *The reader doesn't know what the CIA is doing until very late in the storyline, and the CIA wouldn't be involved in domestic matters anyway.  Again, no relation to reality.  Their real function was to provide someone for Langdon to run away from, and provide the authority figure to be an enemy and then a grudging ally of Langdon's.  Had to laugh at the line about a \\"CIA inquisition.\\"  The big, bad CIA, rather than the big, bad Catholic Church.  *Plot:  The crazed villain is going to tattoo the top of his head with the lost word, sacrifice himself to the dark side, get revenge on those who wronged him, and embarrass the Masons, while preventing the rest of the world from having access to the Ancient Mysteries.  He plays Langdon and Katherine Solomon expertly; they comply with his requests with no verification (I brought the secret artifact that Peter asked me to keep safe with me because someone I'd never heard of or spoken to before told me to?).  The CIA at least had a concrete objective, but their portrayal and behavior were ludicrous.    *Katherine's secret lab-ludicrous.  Peter Solomon can dispose of Smithsonian space to his relatives without formalities?  Katherine has no secure backup for her work?  A carpet path through the dark?  And Peter Solomon's personal space in the Capitol?  Come on.  *Once the villain was disposed of, Dan Brown tried to find some point to it all.  There was really nothing lost to be found, but Langdon had to be convinced that ALL of the world's religions for thousands of years had hidden their common central theme from the unenlightened masses.  For what and how?  And now the Masons can reveal it because of-Katherine Solomon's research?  *Again, it's fiction, but-Katherine Solomon, in an astonishingly short time, and with no apparent help except her mostly-unlamented computer tech and the odd volunteer, no peer review, no corroborative research-has proven the existence of the soul, the ability of humans to affect matter with their thoughts, and all sorts of other things, giving everyone access to the hidden ancient wisdom just as soon as she publishes. All the messy details of competing religions will be forgotten, and we can all become like gods due to our mental abilities, just as soon as this research is released.  Bushwa.  *If you're at all familiar with Washington, D. C., or even able to use the internet, there's nothing amazing about the descriptions of the Capitol and other Washington buildings, except perhaps Brown's continuous attempts to find hidden esoterica.  For example, the painting on the Rotunda of the Capitol is entirely understandable in terms of the 19th century view of George Washington, with no need for convoluted interpretation.He was the father of our country, the exemplar of patriotism, civic duty, and virtue. Many other readers have pointed out numerous errors in the physical descriptions and directions in the book.  The one that stuck out to me:  The Masonic Temple (as it's known to local residents) in Alexandria is not across the street from the King Street Metro station, and that's an easy check.  If you're going to talk about real places, take the 30 seconds it would cost you to get it right.  There was no overriding plot need to change the location.  *Nothing about the Masons was in the least shocking or surprising. They filled the bill for a somewhat secretive, not well-understood group who could be connected to vague esoteric antecedents.  Instead of the Illuminati and Opus Dei as bad guys, you have the Masons as good guys.  Check out some of the Masonic websites for their takes on Brown's descriptions of their rituals and symbols.  *The Solomons are superhumans-no physical repercussions from serious blood loss or nonsurgical amputation-no shock, no pain-Maybe I'll show up at the hospital after I convince this friend of mine that he can get hidden ancient knowledge out of this stone.    All in all, just a badly written, silly, pointless book.
1552091090|1.0|I can't understand why so many people seem to love this book so much.  It starts out cute.  But what is endearing about a mother breaking into her son's house, bringing a ladder fromm across town to boot?  Not to mention that it is just ridiculous to think that she could lift him up.  And not even wake him up.  My husband and I thought maybe she drugged him.  There are so many sweet books about the love between parents and children.  But this is just creepy and weird.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|The sound on from the Canon 7d stock microphone is pretty bad.      I have 2 of these ATR-3350 microphones connected through a dual mono to stereo plug adapter and now I can mic 2 subjects and get good results.    Just have to remember to turn the switch on before recording.
B001OST0LW|5.0|The Dark Knight of Gotham City confronts a dastardly duo: Two-Face and the Riddler. Formerly District Attorney Harvey Dent, Two-Face incorrectly believes Batman caused the courtroom accident which left him disfigured on one side; he has unleashed a reign of terror on the good people of Gotham. Edward Nygma, computer-genius and former employee of millionaire Bruce Wayne, is out to get the philanthropist; as The Riddler he perfects a device for draining information from all the brains in Gotham, including Bruce Wayne's knowledge of his other identity. Batman/Wayne is/are the love focus of Dr. Chase Meridan. Former circus acrobat Dick Grayson, his family killed by Two-Face, becomes Wayne's ward and Batman's new partner Robin the Boy Wonder. Batman Forever is a fantastic installation into the Batman series. It's got action, romance, drama, comedy, and great sets. And a fantastic soundtrack. It's a good movie and should be seen by every Batman fan.
1595141979|5.0|I recently started this series- like 3 days ago- and was instantly hooked. instead of doing homework or required reading i read these books-- for hours. And although the others are amazing this one is by far my absolute favorite. i really cannot wait to get the 4th book tomorrow!     Through all the twists and turns i often found myself pacing, with a goofy smile slapped across my face, or on the verge of tears. The characters are just so gripping and the writing absolutly impeccable, you can't help but fall in love with each and everyone of the characters (some a bit more than others ;])     One the the BEST books i have EVER read (i've read quite a few =])     a MUST buy!
B002LE8EFQ|3.0|When Boyle created a Susansation at the Britain's Got Talent Show last year, a number of very negative comments were posted about her performance on the Youtube site. In response, I predicted that this woman would have a bright future, and I am pleased to see that this has, at least in the short term, become true.<br /><br />I looked foward enormously to her first album, and I must confess that I was a little disappointed upon the first hearing. For this her producer Steve Mac I think must gently be blamed.<br /><br />In singing, the primary relationship must always be between the music and the performer. For the duration of the performance, the teachers (which include technical staff such as producers and other support people) should keep their hands off, because a third party in the mix becomes immediately apparent, except in very rare cases, such as the Sutherland-Bonynge collaboration. While listening to Boyle's debut album, I kept on getting the idea that this wasn't entirely her performance, she was being coached from the sidelines.<br /><br />Just before she went on-stage at the talent show, her words were 'I'm going to make this audience rock!,' which she thoroughly did. It was all her own work, her own personality, her own performance, her back-track, her style of singing using her voice. I'm sorry the production team had too heavy a hand in her debut album, it should also of have 'rocked the audience,' and it does not quite succeed.<br /><br />It is a fabulous CD nonetheless, and although the music isn't my usual fare--I specialise in 18th- and 19th-century Italian opera--it has already started to grow on me.
B001QGRIO8|4.0|heres the thing: im extremely faithful to any author who can capture my attention. i dont read alot...so it really is something to get my attention. Anyways...i love the twilight series. To be honest, i treat everything as though it were real...    TEAM JACOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Edward sucks...and he sparkles. Anyways, this book was amazing (in my opinion). The Jacob portion of the book was the best thing that Meyers could've done. I was severely upset when bella was turned into a vamp...i was hoping she would end up with jake. (in my mind, they did) Becuase I hated Meyers ending...i have to knock a star off of my rating. Jacob wouldve been so much better. This coming from a guy's view point.

0316001821|5.0|I love this book but it is not an easy read nor is it a book for anyone. I read this book as a hand me down when it first came out and honestly did not know what I was getting myself in to. The first chapter brought me to tears and left me so shocked I put the book down and called my step mother to ask her what the heck she was thinking when she gave me this book to read? a few nights later, I picked it back up again... and did not stop reading the entire night. Alice Sebold is an amazing writer and woman may I add , since she is inspired by things that have personally happened to her. This book is beautiful in its own right and it is not a story based on Suzy Salmon's murder or finding her killer, like the movie portrays it. It's about everything else that comes between a family when they have tragically lost one of their own, it's about what a young woman, on the cusp of adulthood, feels when she's been cheated out of life and can't move on by watching her family from her personal heaven.But I think the most important message that is relayed through out the whole book is about forgiveness. I definately recommend this read to my friends... but with a warning to trudge through the rought part.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Having defeated the Joker, Batman now faces the Penguin a warped and deformed individual who is intent on being accepted into Gotham society. Crooked businessman Max Schreck is coerced into helping him become Mayor of Gotham and they both attempt to expose Batman in a different light. Earlier however, Selina Kyle, Max's secretary, is thrown from the top of a building and is transformed into Catwoman a mysterious figure who has the same personality disorder as Batman. Batman must attempt to clear his name, all the time deciding just what must be done with the Catwoman. This beautiful, dark, and funny movie is one of Tim Burton's best work. Batman Returns is an awesome experience for fans that like cool movies.

B00005JXY3|5.0|It's summer, Daniel just broke up with his girlfriend and was told by his mother that her job needs her to move to Fresno for the summer which Daniel doesn't like. Mr. Miyagi was going to let Daniel stay with him until he receives a letter from Okinawa telling him that his father is dying. So Miyagi leaves to go there and Daniel joins him. Miyagi tells Daniel that the reason he left Okinawa was because his best friend, Sato whose family is the most affluent in Okinawa, was promised Yukie whose the girl Miyagi loved. So Miyagi asks her to run away with him and when Sato learned of this, he challenged Miyagi to a fight to the death. So Miyagi left. Upon arriving Miyagi discovers Sato still wants to fight him and his nephew and best student Chozen has it out for Daniel. This movie is set in the beautiful backdrop of Okinawa, and the scenery is also beautiful. I recommend viewing both The Karate Kid, and the sequel to at least get the full effect.
0385504225|3.0|I have to admit it, I adore Dan Brown.  The man takes historical facts, places and people and creates a story the likes of which keep my on the edge of my seat and up way past my bedtime.  Some disagree with the way he writes, but I think the important thing to keep in mind is that these are works of fiction, not fact.  Yes, he takes facts and distorts them, but in a fictional novel, one should expect some embellishments.  I should probably also mention that Brown tells you flat out at the beginning what is real.  Ah-hem.  I will not get on my soapbox...    This story, as I'm sure you know, is set in Washington, D.C.  Brown hooks you from the very beginning, and the mystery only gets more complicated the further you get.  The more important question is, who can you trust?  I found myself questioning the worthiness of some of Langdon's acquaintances, and for the most part they are on the up and up.  There are a few characters though, that will intrigue you and keep you guessing until the end.  And there is one exceptionally creepy/scary/strange individual with a grudge, and he won't stop until he gets what he wants.      Notes on the Cover:  I'm mad about this cover.  The cryptic symbols on the antiquated-looking vellum, the seal from Peter Solomon's ring, the picture of the Capital against a blood-red night sky are all fantastic and obviously the designer paid attention to the content of this one (as they should with ALL books) and nailed it.

It appears from some of those posting reviews here that the Blu Ray version of FMJ is NOT widescreen but some format that cuts out a portion of the frame???

1595141715|1.0|Not so great. Hannah's reasons for committing suicide are unconvincing. So many girls go through the same the things it is very hard to believe that someone would take her life for such mundane things. That being said getting involved in the whole book is hard, and sympathy for Hannah's character doesn't exist. Though I must say the very last page is superb, it really gives the book a sense of hope.
B00297FEUI|5.0|I am not one to ramble on a review, so here it is. . . This score was great. Jablonsky does a wonderful job of making a score that uses the themes of the first movie and making the songs still new and fresh. The score has several songs that I enjoyed completely: \\"Prime\\", \\"Matrix of Leadership\\", \\"I Rise You Fall\\", and \\"Infinite White.\\" This score is more emotional than the first and these songs in particular show it. Jablonsky has made a score that uses the themes from before, and brought them to a whole new level. This score is definitely one that I think should be recognized as a great score, therefore, I give it five stars for continuing the Transformer legacy from the first film, while making the score more powerful emotionally, and giving it great music for the battle sequences. The variety in the styles of the songs alone should be enough to attract anyone to this fantastic score.
B000BMSTMS|5.0|i disagree with those that rag on this album! this is dark songwriting at its finest! it is more gothic which works for them! it is a little different but other times people say all there stuff sounds alike! it still has there sound but with a gothic twist!

0451457994|4.0|I enjoy reading science fiction, although it can be difficult reading some of the older novels, due to their dated quality.  But I found 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY to be an exception to this rule.<br /><br />2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a relatively short novel, and effectively reads like three interconnected novellas.  Each novella is filled with interesting information about space travel and Clarke's theories about the future.  Clarke is an engaging writer who makes complicated ideas understandable, and I found this novel quite engrossing.<br /><br />This novel was originally written in 1968, before humankind even landed on the moon.  Unsurprisingly, Clarke gets many things wrong about life on Earth in 2001(for example, he assumes moon bases exist, as well as the USSR), but it doesn't undermine the power of the storyline.<br /><br />The two major downsides of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY are the superficial characterization (this is a problem with all of Clarke's novels) and the surreal ending, which you will either love or hate.  But in the end, this is a novel of ideas, and the ideas are quite fascinating to read about.<br /><br />In short, while I personally don't consider this novel a classic, it's fun and thought-provoking and well worth your time.
031606792X|5.0|I enjoyed it immensely and will read the series again.  Really didn't want it to end.
B001493FK8|5.0|So... one minor caveat... if you prefer to read a series that will be finished in your lifetime, and you are not a vampire, tree, or sentient rock, you might choose another series.  If you are a vampire, you'll need to turn Martin, because otherwise he probably wont finish the series anyways. :)<br />Great series as far as it goes, but at the current state of the 'next book' being something like 3+ years overdue, don't hold your breath for a completed series.

It seems as if they just never have time for Coraline.<br /><br />Coraline meets the new neighbors who also are tenants in the large old home.

B00005MP58|5.0|Having owned the VHS and DVD versions of this classic, I wondered if it was really worth it to upgrade yet another time. In the end, my love of this story won out.    Best parts about the Blu ray:  -The colors ARE better in the Blu ray version. No more strange coloring of the DVD version.    -The extras (all of them!)  It is fascinating to hear some of the cast (no Ehle or Firth though, unfortunately) to recount their memories of shooting the mini-series and discuss the enduring popularity of mini-series 10 years later (the featurette was shot in 2006).  The behind-the-scene walk-about around the house that was Longbourne was interesting as well (hosted by the actors who placed Wickham and Mary Bennett).

B000OT8GCQ|1.0|I was VERY DISAPPOINTED in this book. I have seen the movies made into books of his but this is the first book of his I have read. I read a lot of romance books and like to leave reality behind, even for a short time by reading. I realize that reality must be in there some, but when you finish a book it is nice to feel good at the end of it, even if it maybe a little sad, but this left a bad taste in my mouth. I doubt if I ever buy anything of his again.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This epistolary novel is one of the most enjoyable I have read in years.  In the course of one subway ride, I laughed out loud and also teared up.  The subtle evocation of post-WWII England and the sense of the world emerging to a new era of possibilities is artfully done through the hopefulness, spirit, and character of the protagonist Juliet and all of the wonderful friends she meets on Guernsey.  A truly wonderful book.
0307387151|3.0|Let me first be clear about this book. There are good books that become popular and there are badly written ones that sometimes become popular. This book tends to fall somewhere in the middle. I'll not go into too much details of the story.  Briony a thirteen year old girl who fantasizes and desires to be a great writer has an elder sister Cecilia. Her house is a mansion on a big estate. Her father stays away on business and elder brother Leon just returns with his friend Paul Marshall. Author describes the estate in great detail but I failed to `see' it.   The char woman's son Robbie had been looked after by Briony's father and had been Cecilia's friend. Briony watches Cecilia's encounter with Robbie where she emerges wet out of a fountain.  Then Robbie happens to make a mistake and hands over the letter with wrong (ugly) words to Briony to give it to Cecilia. Here, the motivation of the character is a problem. I couldn't understand why he at all did it. The explanation that he wanted to prepare a ground for the party at night felt a little flimsy -contrived.  Briony at her age 13 is jealous of Cecilia and Robbie's closeness.   At dinner time the twin cousins disappear and everybody is out searching for them. While the search party breaks into groups only 13 year old Briony is left alone. A coincidence again? But it was essential to leave her alone because she was the one to see in near total darkness a man molesting her cousin Lola. So another teenager was left in the dark alone for molestation to occur.   Briony never really saw who molested Lola but assumes he was Robbie and becomes the star witness when cops investigate. By the way cops never visit the scene of crime to see how dark it was there.  Cops don't take Robbie to any doctor to perform a physical examination. Instead of going to medical college he goes to jail and then he is a soldier in retreat in world war two.  I loved the graphic description of violence in WW2 but all of us have read and seen WW2 violence in movies so often that it feels like a cliché (except shooting of the horses). In the next section again we read about the hardship Briony has to go through her training as a nurse. But going through the rigors of training to become a nurse could hardly be called a torture of penance. Again, there are so many details that don't seem important to the story. For example, though Briony talking to a dying French soldier is very touching it doesn't do anything for the story. The whole description of what Briony sees on the road when she is walking to meet Cecilia is a lot but it achieves nothing.  On occasion the descriptions of war and rigors of nursing feel like a documentary - a nicely written documentary. Briony's repentance never feels real.  If I focus my attention to the three pillars of fiction - setting, character and the story, I feel the author has done very good job at setting but failed to keep the balance with the other two -65% on setting, 20 % on character and 15 % on story.  Characterization is mediocre and Briony feels like a two dimensional character.  The story is a collection of far fetched coincidences. I was intrigued by the ending. Basically writer wanted to end the book with a tragedy, had second thoughts, so turns it into happy ending, then had third thoughts and so turns it into a tragedy.  And come on. A girl marries her rapist because he is moneyed. Who is going to buy that.  Ian McEwan is good at language. His language flows smoothly. But page after page of a narrative, with very little dialog, made a daunting task to finish the book.Some paragraphs are more than half a page - not acceptable by most editors in this era. I planned to read it in one week but it took three weeks. And I had a lot of time at hand.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  Emily Blunt gave a stunning performance as Victoria, but Rupert Friend totally steals the show as Albert, in many ways a much more challenging role, I think.  Albert was a complex, private person and his relationship with Victoria is all the more interesting, because while he dutifully pursued marriage with Victoria as his destined \\"career\\", he did not expect to fall in love or to be loved in their marriage.  Friend does a marvelous job of portraying a very reserved, rational man suprised by his own powerful feelings, and of showing Albert's very dry but keen sense of humor.  Many biographers/historians have suggested that Albert did not love Victoria as she did him, but I think this has much more to do with Albert's reserved, Germanic public persona than any historical reality, as is amply demonstrated in his letters and Victoria's journals.  Friend does a marvelous job of revealing an Albert who loved Victoria deeply and was willing to make great sacrifices for her, but who also had the strength to stand up to her strong will and fiery temper, and not be pushed around. Both actors obviously did their homework on Victoria and Albert and I think very much captured the essence of their personalities.  I also very much enjoyed Jim Broadbent and Harriet Walter's marvelous, feisty performances as King William and Queen Adelaide.<br /><br />One aspect of the film I found a bit jarring was the portrayal of Victoria's relationship with King Leopold and Baron Stockmar as being rather distant and hostile.  While Victoria was quite determined to live her own life and not be a pawn in their (or anyone else's) political schemes, she actually had a very affectionate relationship with her uncle Leopold both before and after her marriage, and Stockmar was a lifelong friend and confidant of both Victoria and Albert and helped them through many of their early marital difficulties.  Their manipulative attitude toward Albert and their obsessive focus on grooming him for marriage to Victoria was historically accurate, and Rupert Friend's portrayal of the young Albert's attitude toward their \\"training\\" is one of the funniest parts of the film.<br /><br />I highly recommend Stanley Weintraub's biographies of both Victoria and Albert for those wanting the real historical background for the film.  Sarah Ferguson's book Victoria and Albert: Life at Osborne House is also a well-researched and beautifully illustrated book about their marriage and family life.<br /><br />There is a bit of minor chronological rearrangement to cram about 5 years of historical material into less than 2 hours, for which I think Julian Fellowes can be easily forgiven, and some slight embellishment of real events for dramatic effect (eg Prince Albert did attempt to shield Victoria in the assassination attempt but was not actually shot, Albert was not present at Victoria's coronation) but I didn't find it detracted from the story.  Much of the script is actually verbatim historical record (King William's drunken outburst at the banquet, Conroy's attempt to force Victoria to sign an order making him Regent) and Fellowes included these bits unaltered, to his credit--they are fabulously dramatic, just as they are.<br /><br />Costuming is gorgeous and well-researched, the film is a visual treat.

0670021652|4.0|From book-review website, Bibliobuffet:    \\"Committed is part memoir and part cultural studies book, giving detailed information on the past and present situation of legal marriages throughout the world. Gilbert points out that marrying for love instead of necessity is a fairly new concept in history, and many countries still believe a marriage has nothing to do with the romantic compatibility of both partners. Gilbert researches a variety of marriage customs and arrangements, the most amusing being an ancient Roman marriage tradition that is still practiced today. When a man asks a woman to marry him in some Roman neighborhoods, he serenades her at her window and the entire town joins in, just like a real-life movie musical. There are singing parts for the man, the woman, and the townspeople, who must each collectively beg Rome not to \\"be an idiot tonight\\" and allow these two individuals to find love, Broadway style.\\"    More of this review here: [...]
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I am a fan-atic about how great these DVD's are.  The footage is incredible, and the narrations very well done. It is entertaining enough to just sit and watch, but it is peaceful enough that it runs very well in the background, like at a party or something. I highly recommend it to anyone!
B001AQTWF2|4.0|liked all the songs except number 6, has ballads and funky beats you can dance to also.  worth the money.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Not being fond of Sarah Bullock and her movies made the decision to get The Blind Side quite a stretch. But I was thoroughly impressed. Being a sports fan, I had followed the success of Michael Oher, and heard anecdotes about the story and movie. But this powerful film of the compelling story is a wonder. You will laugh more than you think, and cry just the same, and enjoy the tale of one young man and overcoming the difficult life he was born into to become a professional football star.<br /><br />Although it did have some violent scenes and some unsuitable language/racism, I do recommend it for family viewing.
B00005JL3A|4.0|I recently viewed all of the \\"Resident Evil\\" films for the first time... Dare I say, I'm very impressed! This particular film had a lot going for it. Milla Jovovich is absolutely stunning as the amnesiac heroine, Marco Beltrami's post modern underscore hits the nail on the head and Paul Anderson's vision of a world overtaken by Zombies is flat intriguing. The entertainment value of this film is through the roof (thanks in no small part to the amazingly emotional connection the viewer creates with Alice,) and the scripting is really pretty impressive!     So, why the four stars instead of five? I hate to say this... Special effects. The special effects in this film occasionally take away from the much needed tension (especially the fight towards the end of the film...) It's odd that they chose to CG the monsters in that manner, because it really looked quite dated. Aside from this, fans of the \\"Resident Evil\\" game franchise will definitely like \\"Apocalypse\\" best (for all of it's one liners and slo-mo action scenes, it captured the spirit of Racoon City in a way neither of the other films did.)     All said, though, this is a really great way to get your sci-fi/Resident Evil fix. (The opening sequences are filmed to delicious perfection with a thick coating of tension, a dusting of old school \\"Alien\\" and an undercurrent of flat out horror.)
B001QBC4AG|5.0|The Who Sell out was the band's first \\"concept album\\" and, it can be argued, was their best concept album until their magnum opus \\"Quadrophenia\\".  The way the band made the album sound like a \\"pirate radio\\" station of the mid-1960's was brilliant and the songs are great.  If this album had been the hit that \\"Tommy\\" was, I believe the band's fortunes would have changed their sound and made them more experimental instead of dragging \\"Tommy\\" around for years.
B000YPUF9W|5.0|From the start, this film had me completely surrendered to it's gripping narrative, fantastic cinematography and hugely entertaining action scenes. Unlike the first two films in the franchise, \\"Extinction\\" brings the next gen gore of the video games \\"Resident Evil 4 and 5\\" to the big screen. No more fast cuts, discreet angles or dark lenses... This is a hardcore, zombie killing action-fest. Aside from this new development, the characters are all written with much more attention to characterization and emotion. There are many scenes in the film where you find yourself GENUINELY caring what happens to the characters. On top of everything I've mentioned, the musical score by Charlie Clouser WAY outclasses the previous two scores and is both effective and well produced. If I had one negative thing to say about this film it's that it ended as soon as it did!
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you want a no-frills, straight-to-the-point, kick-butt workout, buy this DVD.  I don't need to repeat what over 1,000 other reviewers have said.  I tried this DVD and was hooked immediately.  It's easy to use and a very intense workout.  My boyfriend tried the workout with me one day after hearing me talk it up, thinking it was going to be easy (his thought process was something like, he's a guy, I'm a girl, how hard could it be?).  Ha!  He was hooked as well, and bought his own copy the next day.    This DVD needs to be included in everyone's exercise collection.
0767834739|5.0|One word, NEMESIS! \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" takes the viewer straight to the world of the \\"Resident Evil\\" video games... and it's a TON of fun. Picking up exactly where the first film left off, \\"Apocalypse\\" once again puts the viewer in to the extremely competent shoes of our protagonist/heroine: Alice. This time, Alice is a genetically engineered killing machine who makes it her lot in life to kill as many zombies as possible using motorcycles, automatic weapons and even her own fists. From the start, the film takes off at a break-neck pace and simply doesn't let up through it's concise 94 minutes. Many character are added throughout the film (some great, some... not) but if there's one thing this film IS, it's vintage \\"Resident Evil.\\"

0307716988|2.0|The book actually repeated itself so many times. You could have took half the pages out. I was not that impressed. Did not learn anything new and michael did not really open up and share anything that we already didn't know. It was more like he was \\"defending\\" himself in regards to the media and the press. If you want to read a good book where you actually learn things about Michael Jackson, read: Michael Jackson: The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story, 1958-2009.
0740785508|4.0|This book i gave as a gift to my sister who is an illustration major so that she could use it for an upcoming project.

All in all i think that this is an excellent book.
B002RV01Q8|3.0|I love Enya, and I bought this CD/DVD compilation mainly for the DVD, since I already own all of Enya's previous CDs (and even the Region 2 PAL DVD that was released in Europe a few years back).  I am delighted that the DVD contains a 2.0 PCM track, 5.1 Dolby track, and a 5.1 DTS track, but I was INCREDIBLY disappointed to discover the video to be non-anamorphic.  Many of the videos are indeed in the ratio of 16:9 (a few of her older videos are 4:3), so those of you with 16:9 TVs will likely be as disappointed as I.  I am absolutely baffled as to why, in this day and age, Warner would produce this DVD in anything but 16:9 anamorphic.
0375842209|5.0|Not only is this book narrated by a very grim, insightful, and often sarcastically funny Death, but it's full of unforgetable characters you can't help but love. Liesel is an innocent German girl living through the horrors of Nazi Germany. She loses the little family she has, gets sent to live with strangers, and becomes best friends with the Jew hiding in the basement. The story is amazing from page 1!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|It's impossible to watch the trailers for \\"Pandorum\\" and not immediately draw comparisons to its predecessors -- the \\"Alien\\" series, \\"Event Horizon,\\" \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" \\"Solaris,\\" etc. In spite of the easy comparisons, however, \\"Pandorum\\" not only manages to stand on its own two feet but takes things in an interesting new direction.    Yes the basic premise has been done before but \\"Pandorum\\" puts a new spin on things that keeps the story fresh and intriguing. The final twist is new and different, even if the characters aren't quite so (although Dennis Quaid was very good as the level-headed, unflappable captain trapped alone). The acting was solid.    Something I enjoyed that I haven't seen in a horror movie in a long time is the less-is-more approach that the director took with the violence and gore for the bulk of the movie. I think it made things more sinister and mysterious and it kept me guessing at just how dire the situation was and how long it had been going on (is it just a few monsters? How monstrous are they, anyway? Are they completely feral or are they sentient? Have they been eking out a pathetic existence for a few years or for decades?).    Don't pass \\"Pandorum\\" up just because you think you might have seen it before in the form of other movies. There's a good chance you will be pleasantly surprised, especially if you enjoy the genre. I know we were.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is a great First season collection of the Legend of the Seeker Series! Has all the episodes along with bonus features of behind the scenes, deleted scenes as well as audio commentary on at list one episode per disk (except for disk four which has none). I especially loved the audio commentary on disk 3-Puppeteer, with the actors who play Zed and Darken Rahl. It was hysterical! Me and my Daughter could not stop laughing! The only thing I was disappinted in was that there was no Gag reel. I love seeing outtakes when the actors goof around or mess up their lines. I hope they consider doing one for Season 2. I can not wait to purchase the next season as well. I hope they do not consider pulling the plug on this series. I have seen too many good shows end after one or two seasons. They never give them a chance or let the fans decide if they want it to stay. I would love to see it make it through the whole book series.
0891419195|5.0|EB Sledge survived one of the bloodiest and most brutal campaigns in world history, nearly being killed a number of times. This account provides a ground-level narrative of just what that experience is like.  Later in life he becomes a research scientist, and the book is written very matter-of-factly, from that kind of detached observer viewpoint. Yet the humanity comes through powerfully; the descriptions are vivid and detailed, confirmed by historical research, making the story that much more compelling. If you've ever wondered what combat is really like, this is it: week after week of grinding fear, friends dead and maimed, inhuman acts performed daily by ordinary people.  The author describes it as a pestilence on the human landscape, like a vision of hell.  I'll go out on a limb and recommend that every American should read this book or one similar, to have a taste of what the common soldier may experience while serving the interests of the nation.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Supernatural season four DVD is great! Always love the outtakes and Gag reels. Yellow Fever was one of my favorite episodes. Very funny! Will definatley buy 5th Season as I believe that will be the last season for the show, from what I heard. Hope they change their minds.

0385504225|2.0|I read quite few thrillers and detective novels, including all of Dan Brown's. The Lost Symbol, his latest, is a disappointment on many levels. As I was plowing through the book, I kept thinking \\"who cares what happens here?\\" The premise that Masonic secrets could destroy the US government is so preposterous (when you find out what the secret is), that you end of hoping this secret is revealed. Then there is the writing. Brown spends a good portion of the book lecturing us on ancient truths, explaining these in pedantic deal. Too many times there are references to Robert Langdon conducting his class, explaining what the Masonic symbols mean. We are reminded about obelisks over and over, ad nauseum. And pyramids. And all this in a condescending tone.    Don't waste your money on this one. Wait for the movie: it can only be better.

1400052173|5.0|Henrietta Lacks is a miracle: she helped find numerous vaccines and enabled the research and/or discovery of some of medical sciences most devastating diseases and viruses...and she did it all after a fatal bout with cervical cancer.  It was not actually her who did all this, but rather her cells, HeLa.  Very strange, but also very intriguing.<br /><br />Henrietta's cancer cells were taken from her body during treatment and harvested (and still are even today) for medical research.  She did not know, and neither did her family.  Rapidly HeLa mass produced itself and appeared to be immortal.  This was a miracle to science.  Interest in the human story behind this scientific phenomenon was not as quick to develop.  Years of disinterest or misinformation kept the truth from Henrietta's family and the world.  And when they eventually found out, their lives were changed forever.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot takes readers through the life of Henrietta Lacks, well beyond her body's lifespan.  We go to Clover, Turner's Station, and John Hopkins to know her better.  We learn of her children, their children, and eventually their children.  But also in this history is that of scientific progress.  Skloot weaves the human interest story of the Lackses with the evolution of a dicey history of research, DNA, chromosomes, cells and all other intricate science.<br /><br />Skloot is a wonderful writer, with the ability to break down dense scientific jargon and make even the most reluctant science student understand.  Her compassion and honesty are beautiful.  And the story as a whole is fascinating, inspiring, and heartbreaking.  This is truly an amazing book that makes you question the essence of humanity, communal good, ethics, and it may even make you question your beliefs (especially those of us who thought we were hardened, practical skeptics).  Do not pass this book up, it is a treasure.  I could not recommend this book more.

The actual movie is of fairly good quality however, it should be noted that the feature film is only available in normal screen viewing, there is no wide-screen appearance. One can however, choose to add in borders to help diminish the appearance of the black bars on either side.

B002SV3KOM|5.0|My first exposure to Aldo Ciccolini's playing came many years ago while listening to classical radio station KMFA. I turned on the radio and heard the delightful sounds of Satie's gymnopedies. After learning that the pianist was Ciccolini, I rushed out to procure one of his sets of Satie's works. This current EMI compilation contains a generous assortment of Satie including recordings of the gymnopeies and 3 gnossienes from 1956 and 1963 (both exquisite)and the set of Satie recordings from the 1980s. All performances are outstanding, infused with humor and biting wit.<br /><br />I must confess that I have not yet listened to many of the 56 CDs in this set. But I have already found enough delightful recordings to make me glad that I obtained the set. One Saint-Saens disk contains an outstanding version of piano concerto no. 5 performed with the Orchestre de Paris conducted by Serge Baudo recorded in 1970. The disk also contains a lively Carnival of the Animals with Ciccolini and Alexis Weissenberg joining Georges Pretre and the Orchestre de la Societe des Concerts du Conservatoire (recorded in 1966).<br /><br />Jean Martinon leads the Orchestre de Paris in 1974 recordings of the two Ravel concertos. Martinon is one of my favorite Ravel conductors, and the orchestra and pianist really nail these performances.<br /><br />Debussy's piano works are scattered throughout the set, recorded at various times and uniformly excellent. I am particularly fond of the 1991 recordings of Children's Corner and Suite Bergamasque.<br /><br />Unexpected but welcome surprises so far have been a stylish 1976 rendition of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition, a very atmospheric 1953 recording of Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain with the Orchestra National de la Radiodiffusion Francaise conducted by Ernesto Halftter, and assorted sonatas by Dominico Scarlatti.<br /><br />I'm looking forward to delving into a couple of disks of Mozart sonatas next, followed by Liszt's Les Annees de Pelerinage, Granados Goyescas, and Albeniz's Iberia. I anticipate many hours of delightful listening ahead!elerinage, Granados Goyescas, and Albeniz's Iberia. I anticipate many hours of delightful listening ahead!
0385335997|3.0|I loved Outlander, I read it a few times over just because I couldn't get enough of it, plus it's so detailed I can always pick up some little tidbit I missed. Dragonfly in Autumn was good as well but to me it seemed to stray a little in the middle, it just started taking so long for Gabaldon to get to the plot through all the action and side stories. Voyager just completely stalled for me. I had to force myself to finish it, then I didn't even want to read Drums in Autumn which I had already bought.<br />It's hard for me to put into words exactly why I was so disappointed with this book, but I'll try. It just seems like I'm reading and reading and yes there's a lot of action and detail and the story is moving but the plot is not going anywhere! By the time they were on the boats I was just thinking 'get it over with already' and give me an ending to this story, then it just got drug out even further by the kidnapping. I almost didn't even care what happened at that point, it was just too much.<br />I think another thing that disappointed me in this book was that I expected more from the reunion of Jamie and Claire. These are two people that supposedly share such a unique bond and love for one another, but their reunion was really just boring. Here they both thought they would never see each other again and when they do its like Gabaldon gave them 5 minutes of peace to share pictures of Brianna then just sent them on a roller coaster ride that doesn't end until the last page of the book. To me, it wasn't enough to restore their bond to each other and I didn't feel the connection between them.<br />To sum up: I don't know exactly what I expected from this book about Jamie and Claire's reunion, but this in no way satisfied my curiosity.
B000HC2PCM|5.0|After browsing the songs on various \\"best of\\" Merle Haggard discs, I settled on \\"Hag: The Best of Merle Haggard\\".<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed when I popped it in the stereo.<br /><br />The choice of songs was exactly what I was seeking. No live recordings.<br /><br />The quality is first-rate.<br />The sound of \\"Workin' Man Blues\\", \\"Mama Tried\\", \\"Branded\\", \\"Okie From Muskogee\\",and \\"The Bottle Let Me Down\\" make this cd worth having for any Merle Haggard fan.<br />I discovered songs that I wasn't as familiar with- \\"The Legend of Bonnie and Clyde\\" and \\"Old Man From The Mountain\\" to name two of them. These songs were as much a treasure as the more well-known standards.<br /><br />Merle Haggard is a legend both for his guitar playing talent and his songwriting for the common man. All of his best work is on this disc.

B002TYZKIM|5.0|it's a pity that michael never got a chance to do those concerts in london. it would have revive his career and put him back on the spot, but at least we get a chance to see a preview of what things would have been like. we see what a perfectionist michael was and he was 100% involved in everything he does. the film does have some funny moments. my favorite performances were the way you make me feel, billie jean, i just can't stop loving you, and earth song. Human Nature was the best one!! I love the way he sang it. It was different from all his other human nature performances. He dressed very nice throughout the film. I love his ed hardy pants. this film is MUST SEE for MJ fans. This film shows what a caring, unique person he was. Not many singers out there cared about the environment and children like he did. It was like he had that heavenly presence inside of him. No one COULD EVER be like him. he was one of a kind and gifted. this was the first film i heard people actually applauding...of course they would...it's michael!!!! it's been 6 months and it still feels like he's not really gone
B00009TB5G|5.0|This is the absolute best dvd set ever! Lord of the Rings knows the meaning of special features. Forget special 2-disc sets..This has 4! There is so much I could say...But I'll keep it short! This has all the special features you could ask for,besides bloopers.But it doesnt matter that there are no bloopers cause you get hours and hours of behind the scenes.Plus great commentary by the cast(thats the only commentary I have listed to,there are 4 commentaries in total).Anyone would love these dvds!
0694003611|4.0|I think a lot of people are missing the point of this book. The book is an \\"I Spy\\". The intent is for the child to find what is being mentioned.

B000HEWEE4|5.0|Only once before in my three-quarter century life has a story captivated my emotions so enchantingly that my DVD of the movie drew me like a magnet to replay it over and over.  Twelve times in eight days Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves portrayed these lovers to me as naturally and intently as if living the actual story of The Lake House.      Though a complicated fantasy, it must appeal to those who have been or must be separated from their one and only true love for long periods of time. It caused the love for my husband to swell inside me as though to the point of bursting.      The accompanying music was absolutely perfect for each scene and set the emotional atmosphere for that occasion, with silence at appropriate times.  My pen has never written a review, but this movie compelled it to respond.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|Serious musicians often face with the dilemma of creating either the music that they truly want or marketable products.  The opposing forces are at war on Muse's latest.  The Resistance is, I think, an inspiring and genre bending piece of work that both preserves the band's daring artistic integrity and appeals to old and new fans.    The Resistance opens with 3 catchiest pop anthems.  They are meant to be played on radio and TV.  It then takes an abrupt turn at track 4 \\"United States of Eurasia.\\"  A sublime Chopin nocturne in the middle of it showcases band's Romantic classical music influence in full glory.  Three more \\"straight\\" rock numbers later, a Samson and Delilah aria works itself in \\"I belong to you.\\"  To hear a rocker attempting tenor voice is worth the cost of the CD alone.  The album concludes with a song cycle that is structurally similar to a mini-symphony or German lieder.  The songs themselves are operatic in nature with rich orchestration and ethereal falsetto.      The fusion of classical music and rock is as old as the advent of progressive rock in 1970s.  Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody is a prime example of it.  Yet, Muse does it so well.  They comfortably switch from hard rocking sound to dreamy nocturne with me hardly noticing it.  The result is their most mature, heartfelt and epic album to date.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger by Albert Camus is not a typical book you would read in a Catholic school. I discovered this book in my religion class and it has become one of my favorite books. It is so unlike books you would read in school today, it doesn't tell you how to feel it simply tells you about an atheists mans life and doesn't sugar coat anything.     You first meet Meursault as he is on his way to his mothers funeral. He doesn't talk about his emotions for his mother but simply complains about the hot weather. He later has sex with a random girl he meets at his hotel and feels no emotions towards her. Throughout the book similar events like this happening and he simply has no feelings about what happens to him or others around him. He cares about the present and, to a lesser degree, the future. Everything he does doesn't have a purpose and he doesn't care about the decisions he makes. In a way I admire Meursault because he goes through life as it comes, not thinking about his future. You would think he would have no purpose or feel unimportant but he is content with the way he lives his life. There is no happy ending, or epiphany, just Meursault living his careless life.     This book is not up-lifting, but it is an engaging one. I admire this book because it so different, a man is being completely honest about his life and feelings and leaves you thinking. Merusault is not a hero but he is simply an average man that you can't help but to admire.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|Horror movie sequels perfectly illustrates the concept of diminishing return in economics.  FD4 is however a sharp drop in quality from the previous three entries in the profitable teen horror franchise.  FD1 formulates the general ideas (i.e. death and destiny) for the franchise.  FD2 is a great continuation.  FD3 has many great kills though the formula has got stale by then.  FD4 offers nothing new in terms of the story.  Kills are derivative and dull.  Digital blood and sanitized gore look laughably fake.  The opening race track crash and end theater explosion are sub par, comparing to the rollercoaster and subway train accidents in FD3.  The beauty parlor scene is a pale imitation of death by tanning beds in FD3.  The FD4 ending is so abrupt.  It left me scratch my head.      I suppose that the main attraction is the 3D technology.  I saw it in 2D theater.  I doubt that 3D enhances the experience given an inept script and kills.      My individual ratings of the four films are:    FD1  9/10  FD2  8/10  FD3  7/10  FD4  3/10

B002RVZV9K|5.0|Sat on tenderhooks waiting for this DVD to arrive, and essentially it is a documentary on the guitar and its many sounds and influences over the years.  Of course as a U2 fan my interest was the Edge's effects pedals and how he invents his new sounds.  Not only did he show us, but it was refreshing to see the demonstration delivered with such humility and humour.  We were also treated to a tour of Mt. Temple School and the origins of the band, as well as some insights into the meaning of some of the songs.    Jimmy Paige was great in explaining some of the difficulties encountered by bands of the 70's era in trying to put down a quality recording and the stresses of touring whilst trying to re-create this music live.  He notes that the worst reviews they ever received just happenned to be on the album with the most unduring songs -Stairway to Heaven, Whole Lotta Love etc.        Jack White takes us back to his childhood, growing up in a large family with very little money, in a neighbourhood where you were outcast if you played guitar. He also demonstrated some very unique guitar inventions of his own.  As the youngest person on this documentary he insists he is still a 9 year old kid trying to find his own direction.  But it seems his directional influence goes back to the turn of the century blues artists who lived through some very tough times (to which he could easily relate).    If you have ever wondered what drives a person into a musical direction, this will shed some light.
B00000JY1X|3.0|...but I ordered a $36 new boxed set, and how does it arrive? One has a scratched case and one case is broken and the part of it is in the box.

B00127RAJY|2.0|I purchased this video so I could work out at home those days when I couldn't get to the gym. I'm in my twenties and on the chubby side, so I'm not used to working out.  The exercises are a bit too hard if you aren't already in shape, which causes frustration instead of the desire to keep going. I wanted to feel energized but instead I felt worse than when I started, so I put the dvd away and decided that the gym was better for me, since I could start slow and work my way up. My suggestion is, if you're overweight and want a video you can keep up with, THIS ISN'T IT.
B001UE7DBY|5.0|This is not a book about a rugby game--it is a story of the brilliance of Nelson Mandela and his leadership skills that allowed South Africa to transition from the apartheid era to a more inclusive democracy. If you have recently seen and enjoyed the movie \\"Invictus\\", this book will provide a whole lot more depth and complexity to the story. Having spent more than 13 months living in South Africa in the last four years, I have read scores of books about South Africa and Africa. This is one of the most enjoyable and informative of the bunch.

B002N3GD2Q|5.0|The Doors, well known for releasing the same material over and over again in a new package (hello original six albums), have done much to atone for those sins since 2000.  That year, they set up Bright Midnight Records, which was dedicated to releasing uncut, un-doctored live material from the band's archives...the same archives they claimed were barer than die-hard fans knew.  They've released some very excellent product, including most of the material recorded for Absolutely Live.  This includes full, uncut and professionally recorded shows from Detroit, LA, Philadelphia, and other locales.  They haven't released as many shows as originally envisioned, but what they have put out has been reverent.  The only real hiccup along the way was the Matrix release from 2009, which was a great opportunity to finally provide an official outlet for well known bootleg material (the four Matrix shows over two days in early 1967).<br /><br />Finally, finally, they deliver what fans have been clamoring for, especially since Bright Midnight was established: all four Felt Forum shows in their entirety, uncut, and (for the most part) un-doctored.  We get six CDs, and only a little bit of this was ever officially released before; bits were included in Absolutely Live/In Concert, and the 1997 box set had a single disc that cherry-picked tracks from the four shows.<br /><br />This release, another highly recommended gem, just about rounds out the Absolutely Live material.  In January, 1970, The Doors played four shows over two consecutive nights at New York's Felt Forum, the smaller concert venue under the main Madison Square Garden arena.  (They played the main arena in January 1969, but for their new tour, post-Miami, they opted for the superior acoustics and intimacy of the Felt.)  Both nights they played an early and a late show, and packed a lot of material into each.  Not only were these shows recorded in their entirety, but they sound (for the most part) like great shows.<br /><br />While Absolutely Live and other older Doors live material were the product of Paul Rothchild's great talents as a producer, splicing together numerous takes of a single song to create the best-sounding concert album experience, the Bright Midnight releases revel in what fanatics and the bootleg-obsessed have always been interested in: complete, un-doctored shows.  The good news is that the band and particularly Bruce Botnick (original Doors sound engineer) are very open with exactly what was done with the source tapes.  Since those tapes were cut up for previous releases, there are gone-forever snippets here and there, and they went through a painstaking process to review the two-track live tapes versus the eight-track masters in order to determine exactly what was missing.  In those cases, they swapped in parts of another 1970 show that fit the mood.  You would be pretty hard pressed to identify these snippets in your ears, the work is seamless.<br /><br />The biggest manipulation here is actually the overdubs done by John Sebastian, who joined the Doors on stage for one of the shows but whose harmonica was not picked up by the mic.  I believe the 'bare' tracks will be released online, so fans can get both.<br /><br />Many will note the differences between the early and late shows on each night.  Typically, the later shows are longer and a bit more revved up, including longer jams and more improv.  However, having four professionally recorded shows is a major bonanza.  Once again, all of the in-between tuning, crowd noise, and chatter is included (tracks are titled 'Tuning / Breather', for instance).  Yes, these tend to break up the momentum, and we now realize that bootleggers were regularly trimming these breaks to death in order to fit shows on a record or CD, but they reflect how the band performed.  You'd be much harder pressed to see a band today that took a long breather between songs, and indeed, The Doors famously never agreed on a set list before each show, but rather let the vibe and the audience dictate where they would go.  This was the band getting back to just the music, and returning to the blues work that defined their earlier club days.  They also play several tracks from the not-yet-released Morrison Hotel.<br /><br />Despite the glut of recent quality releases, Doors fanatics know that there is a good chunk of material still out there, ripe for the official outlet.  This includes a number of professionally recorded or broadcast shows, including Seattle, 1970 (by many accounts a poor show with a very drunk and distant Morrison), Vancouver 1970 (significantly better), and the Isle of Wight performance, a crisp, broadcast version having been available on bootleg for over a decade.  And there's plenty more if they want to get back into releasing audience stuff (the Boot Yer Butt box, while expensive, had some very, very rare material, though some of it was in horrendous quality).<br /><br />Highly, highly recommended for the Doors fan.  New fans, too...if you want a great intro to the live Doors, and a lot of value, this set is a great boon.  Note the cover of the box, which reproduces an actual ticket from these shows, and the $5.50 price of an orchestra ticket.  You can still go to the Felt Forum today (which has since gone through about 100 name changes), but for $5.50 you might only be able to get a box of Cracker Jacks.audience dictate where they would go.

B00005JPD0|5.0|Déjà Vu, starring Denzel Washington, is a heavy action, suspenseful thriller that will keep viewers captivated and pushes them to the edge of their seats as Doug Carlin (Washington) is racing against time to do the impossible: alter the past. The film in located in the southern United States, where several crimes fueling the movie's story line, take place. Déjà Vu is packed with action, romance, and the thrill of a time governed adventure.   The movie starts abruptly with the explosion of a ferry carrying hundreds of celebrating southern folks celebrating a return from war. Doug Carlin, an investigator in the area is located at the scene of the crime where he meets a girl, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton), who will later evolve into one of the main protagonists of the movie. Carlin is turned on to the criminal responsible for the death of Claire a little bit later in the movie. Throughout the film, Carlin seeks to find the corrupt suspect. Happening to come along a top-secret government project involving a highly intricate time altering system which can see into the past, Carlin teams up with a few of the guys working there to try to solve the mystery. The time device sees exactly 4 days into the past, which is a highly time sensitive disadvantage. Using the film captured from the past, Doug traces the criminal who plans to kill Claire. Carling must keep up with him in order to halt his operations before they turn deadly.   Several important factors prove crucial in the plot and desired suspense of the film. The ingenious concept of the delicate fold in time adds a bit of positive confusion for the viewer. This allows the viewer to contemplate the concept to fully understand the film. This unique trick gets the audience thinking deeper into the complexity of the movie. The director, Tony Scott, does very well in this aspect, but also the acting. Denzel Washington played an exemplary part in the movie, his ability to create an extremely convincing illusion of sheerskill and adventure. Washington's convincing performance did well drawing in the theatergoers to keep them intrigued as to what will happen next. James Cavielzel played the part of the antagonist in the film, Carroll Oerstadt. Caviezel's performance, too, was very convincing and creates a harsh tension between Washington's character as well as the audience.   Déjà vu, as a whole, drew me into the action. Throughout the film, I found myself drawn into the action, complete with a pulsing heart rate and a real connection to the characters. The special affects and the all around hair raising experience gave the movie a great feel. The advanced technology featured in the movie was laid out so well, it would have been surprising to know it was not real. In my personal opinion, Déjà Vu is a must see for any avid adventure film addict. The movie never ceases to amaze in the way that you never really know just what will happen next. I challenge anyone who doubts the quality of this movie to see it, I guarantee, you will not regret it. Undoubtedly, four stars. ****

B001KVZ6G6|4.0|Everything about the latest Pixar release, Up, sounds like it shouldn't work.  The main character is a curmudgeonly senior citizen (voiced perfectly by Ed Asner), the villian is an even older crank (voiced by Christopher Plummer) with an army of talking dogs at his beck and call and the movie begins where many stories would end:  at what appears to be the conclusion to a rich and fulfilling life enjoyed by the now bitter and lonely main character.<br /><br />The grumpy old man in question is Carl and as the movie begins, we are treated to a brief but brilliantly crafted prologue that shows us how he met and married his childhood sweetheart Ellie.  In a much talked about 4 minute passage of the film that contains no dialogue, we watch their life together from their wedding day to Ellie's death.  It is a beautiful segment that speaks volumes about the joys and disappointments of life without a single word being spoken.<br /><br />Flash forward to the present, where Carl has become an angry shut-in desperately clinging to his home and the memories of his past life with Ellie. With developers pressuring him to sell his home, and facing the prospcet of being carted off to a retirement community, Carl decides to tie thousands of balloons to his beloved home and float away to Paradise Falls, an exotic locale that he and his late wife always dreamed of visiting but never quite got around to.<br /><br />Ok, so the whole floating house thing requires the willing suspension of disbelief, but that's really not a problem since as soon as Carl is airborne, we are swept up in the story which, as it turns out, is fairly conventional. Carl is unknowingly accompanied by Russell, a jovial wilderness scout who is attempting to earn his \\"assisting the elderly\\" merit badge.  When the two arrive at Paradise Falls, they are joined by Doug, a talking dog who has rebelled from his pack, and Kevin, a rare and exotic bird that is being hunted by the movie's villian.<br /><br />Again, the plot is fairly conventional.  Carl finds himself becoming very close with Russell and he learns that life is always full of new beginnings.  He also has to foil the plans of the would be bird hunter and his canine minions.  Nothing that happens in Up (aside from dogs flying fighter planes) will come as much of a shock to anyone.  What will stay with you, however, is the generosity of spirit and adventure the film offers and the surprisingly powerful emotions that it stirs up by merely showing us that life doesn't have to end when the people we love are lost.  That's a bold statement for any film to make, let alone a cartoon about a man and his floating house.arl finds himself becoming very close with Russell and he learns that life is always full of new beginnings.

1579128149|5.0|Theodore Gray takes a subject that could be dry and  brings it to life with entertaining pictures and  interesting facts.  One could catalog the elements  by just taking a picture of some small boring sample,  but instead, he shows \\"objects\\" of many types which  demonstrate the uses of each element.    The book inspired me to follow up.  I wondered where  he got the various elemental coins from, and I found  the web site of the guy who makes them.  Then, like  a kid in a candy store, I drooled over which items  to acquire, frequently checking back with Gray's book  to decide which I must have first, and by the way,  which I might regret having (like the element that  leaves your hand \\"smelling like rotten garlic\\" if  you dare touch it).  As a kid, I wanted to collect  all the elements - but it was too hard (especially  long before the internet allowed easy search and  access).  In Gray's book, you can see just what it  would be like to have achieved that goal.

B002PMV9FG|1.0|I'm glad I missed this in the theatre. I spent 153 minutes squinting and craning my neck at the screen trying to see what was happening: the film is so dark it looks like they filmed it by candlelight. Absolutely horrid. Whereas the previous films in this series did a reasonably successful job of encapsulating the stories and filling in the back story, this film left out so much important detail that Snape's key pronouncement at the end, that he is the titular 'half-blood prince,' is a whopping 'So what?' moment that seems almost trivial. Great characters and major thematic elements are entirely marginalised or pushed so far to the periphery that the film feels lifeless and void.  Based on this clumsy adaptation, the fact that David Yates is going to be directing the final instalments does not bode well for the finale, unless he can learn to properly light scenes and not gut the story of its impact. Writer Steve Kloves and Editor Mark Day are to blame as well for robbing this film of all the magic viewers have come to expect from this series.   Read the book and forget this film exists. Besides, Hollywood will remake this series in a few years anyway...

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Cool to here the different takes of Beatles songs in MONO compared to stereo.  Beatles White Album in mono is superior to the stereo version and nice to hear on CD finally.  However, this is at least the second pressing of the Mono set.  They ran out of first pressing which was supposed to be limited edition but was not and created more.  Very lame to us serious Beatle collectors.  Don't say \\"Limited Edition\\" when it isn't.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|Steve Vai is a gifted and unique guitar player who plays with passion and creates awesome original musical masterpieces. This is an excellent concert DVD that captures his live showmanship and shows why he is considered one of the best guitar players and entertainers ever. His band is superb and really supports the music with great performances all round. The vision is stunning and the sound is even better. The editing is great because it was done by Vai himself - no quick shots and stupid effects to detract from the performance. I have always loved Vai's work and this DVD just confirms how awesome he is. Highly recommended to Steve Vai fans and fans of virtuoso guitar playing. Up there with the best!

I payed extra for shipping and it got here in a day but it was just the movie case. Was very disappointed so be sure to check that it is truly the product you want....

B000I2J6K0|5.0|I initially bought this DVD because the reviews were from avid exercisers who said that it got their heart rate up.  My only problem: I am not an avid exerciser.  I can't remember the last time I did anything, and my exercise during my pregnancy has been limited to the occasional prenatal aqua fit class.  I purchased this DVD at the onset of my 2nd trimester, but hadn't gotten around to do it by 24 weeks (like I said, not a big exerciser).  I was also nervous that it might be too much of a challenge after reading the other reviews.    I was pleasantly surprised with this work-out.  As I started the warm-up I thought to myself \\"oh boy, will I survive this?\\" but I found it fun, challenging, not exhausting, and moved quickly.  I was not watching the clock during this work-out (if it's too exhausting or boring I tend to).  I liked Erin, she seemed down-to-earth (perhaps it was her lack of make-up) and encouraging (I laughed out loud when she would reassure the viewer by saying \\"you're okay!\\")     This DVD gets the thumbs up from from active mom's-to-be, and as one who is far from active, I just wanted to add my two cents about this being a fun and totally doable workout.  I'm going to try to incorporate it frequently into my routine, as I am gaining weight quickly despite my healthy diet.  Also, I am concerned about the \\"marathon of birth.\\"    Good luck mommies!
0446567337|1.0|Okay for all of you who say you \\"don't want to spoil the book\\" for others, the title already tells you what's going to happen. A \\"Dear John\\" letter is how people refer to a letter that someone writes to break up with someone!  If you love someone the way John and Savannah did WHY would you choose to marry someone else? And you choose the cowardly way to tell him through a letter?  John derserved better than that.  Also, just because John was in the army does not mean you can't get married!  I married my husband when he was in the Army.  Duh!  Also, did anyone else notice that Mr. Sparks repeated verbatim phrases from The Notebook????  i.e. She asks \\"What do you remember the most? his answer \\"All of it.\\"  I KNOW that Allie asked the same question of Noah.  That's it, let's just regurgitate what worked the first time.      I was thrilled that John did not end up with Savannah.  In my mind, John learned what unconditional love was from his relationship with Savannah, but he went on to love another who was much better suited for him and much more deserving of his love.  Thanks Savannah!    I will not be reading anymore of Nicholas Sparks books!  Yuck!
0345441184|5.0|Bradley is an amazing author and one I have read a lot of over the years.  \\"The Mists of Avalon\\" goes above and beyond Arthurian legend to date.  This 876 page novel offers a tantilizing glimps of Camelot and Avalon in contrast to all fiction before it.  The \\"bad\\" legends are more human and realistic while the \\"good\\" ones show imperfections.      This is written from the perspective of Morgaine of the fairies and sister of Arthur as well as the eventual Lady of the Lake, who is striving to serve her goddess.  We grow with Morgaine from her childhood in Tintagel through her time at court with her stepfather Uther to her acceptance as a priestess trainee on Avalon.  From there we travel the land of England through wars and death to Arthur's inheritance of his fathers throne as a young man.  Frought with peril Arthur draws the peoples of England together, both Chrisian and Pagen, to overcome the Saxons and gain peace in the land.  But that is just the beginning...the characters are richly developed and are very realistic.  Caution- this is a book from a pagen view point and as such some of the Christian beliefs are not looked upon in a favorable light.  That having been said this is an amazing book that encompasses all of the Arthurian legends and wraps them into a believable and amazing story.  Thank you Marion Zimmer Bradley for a fabulous tale.
0753801728|2.0|Oddly engaging, yet wholly unbelievable. The first-person narrator is charmless and preachy, and the circumstances surrounding the relationship between the teenage boy and the older woman (not to mention the relationship itself) is completely ludicrous and poorly motivated. I like the idea of a novel dealing with later-generation Nazi guilt from the German citizen perspective, but the issue is so weighed down with theoretics, rather than true feelings or thoughts, that it comes across dry and essayist, instead of compelling fiction as truth. A different author with this material may have hit gold, but Schlink fails to ignite much of anything here, and the result is disappointing and a bit frustrating.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|AMAZING!<br />Apart from the fact (as others have mentioned prior to this review) that any profanity (including b*tch) is cut out and DOES NOT mention online this is so, the album is fabulous.<br />First, she came out with The Fame (on which every song was a hit). Then The Fame Monster. I didn't think she could get any better after Pokerface and I Like It Rough, but here she is, returning with another amazing collection.<br />I never actually bought The Fame when it was released, so it was great to get both of the albums together for $15 (or it was when I purchased it).<br />Bad Romance has definitely got to be the best one yet. Alejandro and Monster (tracks 2 and 3 respectively) are amazing as well.<br />Now that I've heard this album, I can't wait for another!<br />KEEP IT UP GAGA!
1604244674|5.0|Most people never truly contemplate the real meaning of beauty. It has an alluring quality that cannot be fully understood, even in an abstract form. One of English author Oscar Wilde's  motivations was to write a work that praises beauty as an art but simultaneously reveals its darker nature. That is what I believe he attempts to accomplish in his sole novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray. The work is set in late 19th century London at a time when the cultural excesses of the Victorian era reached their zenith. Infused with elements of Gothic horror, it is a work of Symbolist prose, the Symbolists being a group of literary luminaries who sought to glorify beauty and aesthetic decadence almost as a kind of spiritualism. Wilde is no doubt part of this new endeavor to perceive beauty in an innovative fashion, and he objectively promotes a rather original world outlook through the dynamic characters he creates.<br /><br />The Picture of Dorian Gray is built upon an interesting premise. A local artist named Basil Hallward is fully enamored by the subject of his latest portrait, the eponymous Dorian Gray. Basil, like almost everyone else, is impressed by Dorian's pulchritude and handsome features. As Dorian indulges Basil by sitting for a portrait, another one of Basil's friends, a dignified aristocrat named Lord Henry Wotton, enters and, he too, takes a tremendous liking for the vigorous youth. Later, Dorian holds a discussion with Henry about senility and Wotton reveals to him his hedonistic worldview: \\"To me, beauty is the wonder of wonder. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world lies in the visible, not the invisible. [...] A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.\\" With this in mind, Dorian upholds a new creed by swearing that youth is the only noble quality worth possessing; he would rather have Basil's new portrait of him age in exchange for remaining eternally young. Consequently, Dorian proceeds to engage in every sort of pleasurable vice possible, while the picture of himself hanging in his room slowly decays. The plot proceeding from this point forward holds up well, though the climatic conclusion may seem clich&eacute; in light of the Gothic horror stories that many readers are acquainted with.<br /><br />Wilde does a splendid job of displaying a tone of biting sarcasm. His clever use of wit and double entendre to reveal introspective truths with all the effort he can muster is one of his valiant triumphs. Dorian's lust for sensual pleasure reveals the author's taste as an aesthete and suggests another aspect of the novel's motifs, that of duplicity. Dorian leads a double life by interacting with aristocratic high society during the day and indulging his senses at night. This dualism of Dorian's character underscores the dramatic complexity of his inner struggles.<br /><br />Dorian Gray can be seen as a man willing to exchange his very soul for what he craves. He candidly discards his reputation and eventually risks his life for his lofty desires, which is reminiscent of the Faust legend. Wilde's protagonist is not very remorseful for his debauchery and is constantly being manipulated by his friend and confidant, Henry Wotton. Ultimately, Dorian is a tragic hero participating in an Aristotelian tragedy where he is subtly cognizant of his impending doom and experiences multiple catastrophes. His hamartia proves to be his downfall.<br /><br />While every work of fiction has its shortcomings, Dorian Gray's are minimal. The author exhibits a delightful candor in his narration and characterization, and his nuanced writing style is replete with metaphorical and psychological analyses of flawed individuals.  No bookstore should ever be complete without a copy of The Picture of Dorian Gray adorning its bookshelves.xchange for remaining eternally young.

B002IVLH60|1.0|The last good LP by PJ was Binaural which was over produced so the tracks from which can only be appreciated on the live recordings the band issued for that tour and tours previous. It's time for Pearl Jam fans to get introduced to Queens of the Stone Age because Pearl Jam is essentially 'spent' just as U2 has been (1979 - 1992).   Any work from PJ past 2003 is to fund side projects and to donate to charity, both of which are worthy projects, so buy the disc but don't bother trying to be moved intellectually or spiritually or even physically by it because it won't happen. My apologies if that opinion offends. The Industry would be smart to have Brendan O'Brien work on and release the VH1 Honors Who Tribute with Pearl Jam, Foo Fighters, Incubus, etc. because that is the last great recording from each band.

B000683VI4|1.0|I recently read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks and was so excited that it was a movie. Within the first 5 minutes I could see where it was going and it was very disappointing. The movie failed to capture the sweetness, tenderness and joy of Noah and Allie's relationship. It also failed to portray their characters as they were in the book. The book was so beautiful and moving that had the director chosen to stay true to the story, it could have been magical on the screen as well. I thought the scenes with Noah hanging from the ferris wheel and Allie undoing his pants as well as laying in the street risking being runned over by a car were ridiculous, immature and typical Hollywood. They were so out of character as well as the fighting scenes. Noah was a gentle soul and would never raise his voice and you would never hear the Allie of Spark's book using that kind of language. He also never broke up with her in the book, no matter how hopeless it seemed. He lived for her all the years they were apart (14). There were so many inconsistencies with the book. I really cannot recommend this movie. Leave it to Hollywood to take something perfect and ruin it.
0316044938|2.0|I found The Lovely Bones to be yet another exercise in someone having strong writing fundamentals and having no idea what to do with them. I'm going to go Biblical on this one - The Good, The Bad, The Ugly. (Spoilers galore.)    The Good:      - The prose is lovely. The sentences are all snappy and never dry. It's really        quite a trick to write compelling prose that can move the reader along quickly.      - The murder is never solved. I was worried about this because most murders are        never solved. I was afraid the book would solve the murder and I think that's a        slap in the face to anyone who's ever had a loved one die with no explanation.      - Some of the characters are really well developed.     The Bad:     - The story is groan inducing at times. The part of the story where Susie has sex        with her childhood crush is just a horrific cop-out. The ending was also        miserable in a sit-com resolution way.      - Even with some well developed characters, the story is driven by both the plot        and the need to hit plot points. For all the different characters, there is never        any drama from them interacting. Essentially, everyone is friendly with everyone        else.     The Ugly:     - The alcoholic in the story is a loveable drunk.      - Most of the characters have the emotional depth of a Pepsi can. The only two        stages of grief anyone goes through are denial and depression. There is no anger        and arguably one instance of bargaining.     Overall:     This novel is essentially a female perspective, beach book version of the movie The Pledge. In my experience, women focus much more on the relationships between people whereas men are more goal oriented. This book only focuses on the relationships. The Pledge is all about how a detective promises a family to solve the murder of their child and how he becomes destroyed by never achieving his goal. Both stories are rather existential, but Lovely Bones feeds the reader some sappy emotional moments while The Pledge doesn't. This is a book made to produce some tears and be read quickly.
0786939532|4.0|Great read for anyone who enjoys Forgotten Realms.  The underdark and drow society get an excellent treatment at the hands of the Author.    I read this about a year ago and have read every subsequent book by the Author relating to these characters.    Good job Salvatore.

I've made a couple of the recipes since I received the cookbook last month and they came out great. It's a very easy book to follow, all the ingredients are easy to find in any local market, and the instructions are detailed. You can't go wrong. Not only did I get a wonderful new cookbook (that I'll actually use), the price was fantastic.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|In an age where the majority of children's movies have inappropriate language or potty humor, sexual suggestiveness, stereotypical gender roles, and a good deal of violence and fighting, the films of Hiyao Miyazaki are a breath of fresh air. My children are 4 and 6 and they absolutely LOVED this movie. We saw it in the theater twice. As others have said, the animation is incredibly beautiful. The characters are unique, the story is imaginative and wondrous. Sure, maybe every detail is not explained, but this is a children's film -- children don't need every detail to be explained. The story moves along in a dreamlike way, much the same way that a child's imagination flows.    As far as the film being scary, my four-year-old was a bit frightened of Ponyo's father at first. However, this movie is so tame compared to most children's movies today. My children were much more frightened by the baby who burst into flames in The Incredibles and the monsters who scare children in Monsters, Inc. than they were by Ponyo. I think it is partly because Ponyo is so surreal and dreamlike where many children's movies have an element of reality to them. There is no doubt in the viewer's mind that this film is make-believe -- perhaps this is why it did not scare my children as much as other Disney films.    Anyway, I highly recommend this movie, particularly for children ages 4-7. The animation is extraordinary, the characters are loveable, and it is overall just a refreshing change from other children's movies today.
B000002MG1|4.0|This album came out during a time in my life when I had lost a job that I loved, for reasons that were about nothing but sexual discrimination.  After losing my job; I was evicted from an apartment I'd been living in for eight years.  For the first time in my life I was homeless, very angry, extremely afraid, and depressed in the most dark and painful way ever.  I became very self-destructive, hopeless, purposeless, and dead.  I was staying at a friends apartment for a while, and when I discovered that that friend was not a true and caring friend; I dived though a glass window from a 30 feet balcony.  I severely fractured my skull, put myself in a coma, lost my ability to walk and talk for 13 months.  While I was in the hospital for rehabilitation, a friend brought me some music he thought might be uplifting; and \\"Automatic For The People\\" was one I listened to everyday.  There were three songs that effected me deeply.  EVERYBODY HURTS made me cry, and at the same time made me angry.  Sure everybody does hurt; but not everybody is capable of dealing with hurt.  I wanted the tell Michael Stipe to shut his damn mouth; but I still listened to the song everyday.  The second song that I like to hate was TRY NOT TO BREATHE.  Again I found myself spilling out the foulest of words at Michael Stipe; because I thought he was telling me that no matter how many times I might try to kill myself, that it will never work for a reason.  I cursed at Michael Stipe big time about this song.  But I guess I really liked it more than I was willing to admit at the time.  The third song the pissed me off had a title that elevated my blood pressure.  SWEETNESS FOLLOWS I thought was trying to tell me that a sweetness in life is waiting for me, and that was why all of my attempts at suicide had not been successful.  I hated this song, and I liked it at the same time.  I am still healing from an acute head trauma, and I still listen to this album a lot.

0743297334|3.0|Ernest Hemingway's The Sun Also Rises tells the story of fictional character Jake Barnes and his friends. The stories in this book tell of their experiences living in Europe, drinking together at different bars, and travelling, specifically to Spain. This book fits very well with Hemingway's Lost Generation due to the fact that I felt completely lost reading it. I had trouble discerning what the point of the book was until its conclusion. At one point I believed this book would be similar to Jack Kerouac's On the Road, and at other times I simply thought it was a look into the incredibly interesting world of Spanish bull fighting. The lack of a driving plot made this book difficult for me to get through, and I never found myself completely consumed with Hemingway's fictional world. On a better note though, Hemingway's style of writing is exceptional. His diction reveals a subtle sense of humor through random puns and joke's within the dialogue of his characters. The dialogue Hemingway creates between his characters is very real, and effectively draws the reader into the story.         If The Sun Also Rises were to be placed into a literary genre, it would most likely be a story of forbidden love. This label however does not fully capture the theme of the novel. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is clearly in love with his friend Lady Brett Ashley, but unable to act on his feelings due to insecurities he has. Many of the other main characters in this book are males, and almost all are equally obsessed with Brett, but all also lack the confidence required to win her over. While forbidden love is a strong theme, the idea of human insecurity plays a strong role in this story. I also found the way Hemingway writes about Spain in this story to be quite interesting. His elaborate descriptions of bull fights and his instructions on how to properly drink from a wine skin give the reader an idea of Spanish life. I would recommend this book to someone interested specifically inthe Lost Generation, but to no one else. It simply did not suck me in the way other books have.

B000SFJWLU|5.0|Every song is great!  The only bad thing about this disc is that I can't imagine the band ever surpassing the quality of the music herein.  It's really that good.  I've heard these guys being compared to a modern day Pantera.  They're actually better song writers, not quite as talented skill-wise, but still very gifted.  Bathory writes some excellent and memorable riffs, and Ivan Moody's vocals are beyond reproach.  Actually, as good as the guitar work is, it's Moody that really makes this band what it is.  His agressive, emotionally charged delivery really breathes life into these songs.  He can scream, growl, or sing with beautiful clarity.  Even when he does his screamo/growl he still enunciates well enough that the lyrics are discernible.  All in all, this is one of the best metal bands around.  I've read some reviews that state that Motograter is better or Ghost Machine is better.  I bought both cd's to test this theory.  Can't say I agree.  Moody lifts those other outfits, but it's his pairing with Bathory that creates the heavy metal holyland.  Hope they can keep producing such high-quality metal.  Everyone should own this!  It's the Way of the Fist!!!
B002SJIO4A|1.0|I had 4 FREE bucks to spend here on Amazon at Video on Demand and since this was supposedly a hot new movie I figured I would give it a try as the previews had seemed interesting. WOW! What a waste of time this piece of crap was! The story is totally contrived and dubious. A huge alien ship just sits over Johannesburg, SA for no apparent reason? The grotesque aliens just sit inside of it and starve to death till some humans decide they want to cut their way in and see what the deal is months later? Oh and these aliens look about as smart and capable of space flight as a bay shrimp. HA HA! They are called \\"Prawns\\" in the movie! Please....<br /><br />Then there is the supposed main character. This guy is stupider than dirt and a total lame brain. About the only thing he can do is scream F You repeatedly! Frankly, I just kept wishing he would be killed and the movie would end sooner...<br /><br />The supposed underlying theme about how this movie relates to the substandard treatment of \\"illegal aliens\\" is laughable at best. I mean in this movie you couldn't possibly care about any of the humans or the aliens. They all suck. Nuking them would be a public service!...LOL<br /><br />Don't waste your time here if you have more than 5 functional neurons...PATHETIC!!!
0123694965|5.0|I've been a professional game developer for quite some time now, and I have seen the number of game design books on the market increase dramatically over the years. It can be hard for someone new to game design to find a book that a) isn't outdated, b) has timeless, practical advice, and c) reads so well that you're actually entertained as you learn. The Art of Game Design does all of these things remarkably well, so if you're searching for a book on game design, I recommend you stop now and just pick up this one.    In here, Schell teaches you not only how to create great games, but great experiences. He draws upon a multitude of disciplines and years of application to explain principles that will never be outdated. I truly don't think anyone, whether novice or advanced, could read this book and not come out a better designer because of it. Reading it will spark many new ideas in your mind, and if you're already designing a game, encourage you to look at it in whole new ways to bring out its full potential (or make you realize you should trash the idea altogether.)    There is also an accompanying product, [[ASIN:0615218288 The Art of Game Design: A Deck of Lenses]], which are a bunch of cards that each ask you to look at your game from a different perspective. The book was so good I actually got the cards, too, just to support the guy, but you know what? They are actually incredibly helpful, and are now an invaluable design tool that I use on all the games I create.    So just in case I haven't been totally clear: if you're interested at all in game design, get this book now!

B000BMHVSQ|4.0|In his novel The Sun Also Rises, Ernest Hemingway introduces readers to members of the Lost Generation. These pour souls are what remains of the youth of World War I, a generation whose hope in humanity has been destroyed and who now drift through life aimlessly in a search for meaning. Hemingway takes us on a trip to Paris, where we meet Jake Barnes (the voice of the novel), a man who has been both emotionally and physically wounded by the war. We also meet the woman Jake loves, Brett Ashley, but due to his wound and her independent spirit, they cannot be together. Along with the unfortunate lovers is Robert Cohn, a former boxer and budding author who cannot keep his emotions in check. The Sun also Rises tells the intertwining story of these three Americans and their companions, as they travel from France to Spain for a Bull Fight and fiesta.       Hemingway's strengths lie in his creative symbolism, nuanced dialogue, and beautiful descriptions. As the characters interact with one another, the reader can always feel something more looming behind their words. Especially when Brett Ashley speaks, her voice is that of a carefree woman who truly longs for a more meaningful life, although she will never actually admit it. When Hemingway describes a scene, he uses color to assert his feelings about the place. For example, France is often pale and slightly gloomy, while Spain is always vivid and teeming with life. Water and bulls are other symbols in the novel, but I would not want to spoil the fun of deciphering their meaning for anyone else.        Like all of the classics, The Sun Also Rises does have its shortcomings. At times the plot will drag on, with characters doing nothing but drinking, complaining, and drinking some more to escape the drudgery. This novel is not for the faint of heart, it is one that requires steady reading and some contemplation. So if you are looking for a quick read on the plane or at the beach, I would recommend you save Hemingway foranother time.         Personally, I enjoyed exploring The Sun Also Rises. Hemingway has a unique writing style that made me pause and sometimes even chuckle under my breath. His character Jake Barnes is witty and insightful-- the kind of person you enjoy getting to know as you read along. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little scandal, romance, and a journey into the minds of lost souls.

B001FE4I6C|5.0|First of all I am an American, so no genes give me empathy for rugby.  I was drawn to the original book by Mr. Carlin due to the movie Invictus.  What I got was a wonderful expanse of what has made South Africa the miracle of the 20th century.  With an awful experiment of apartheid and dispicable Boers behavior comes the saintly Nelson Mandela after 27 years in prison for organizing direct conflict with the government.  Somehow much of the information that was revealed in this book like the conditioning for his release and expressions of Mr. Mandela to his jailers and fellow Xhosa have escaped the general press.  He was selected for his attitude, his forsight and his charity half way through his prison term to be a possible \\"leader\\" should one man-one vote become law.  Indeed the course of his jailing, the murders carried out in the townships, and direct challenge to his tolerance reveal a man that should not have had to share the Nobel Peace Prizewith anybody.  This book is a wonderful history, sometimes told in the first or third person, with the ingenious choice to use what the Boers held closer to them than religion, rugby; to make South Africa a strong nation with the chance that blacks, and townships, could have the time to develop after 40+ years being tortured.     I am a great fan of rugby and am always amazed at how any professional rugby player could put a NFL player to shame for conditioning and fortitude.  This choice of team captain Francoise Pinaar to carry the message, invoking the Boks' green and gold colors, games, and international competition was a great story, both of sports challenges (similar to the 1960 ice hockey US Olympic victory), and how it seemed to bring along black participation to root for a sport they truely hated before the 1995 World Cup.      It is too bad that the Movie \\"Invictus\\" chose to only touch the rugby connection, because I think they missed the true greatness of this book:  How Mandela behaved and thought.    This is asgood a read as I've had in a long time.  Maybe Mr. Carlin can come up with a similar story when, and if, the All Blacks ever win a Rugby World Cup.      Good work.
0439023483|5.0|This book is titled under YA but written so well it would entertain any book reader at least young teen of age.  This book packs all kinds of feelings into one.  Laughter, fear, anger, remorse, and romance all in one book.  Characters are well written and easily relatable.  Fantastic book, best book I have read in awhile.  Already reading the second one and can't wait for the third.  Finished it in a new personal record time.  I can't stop reading.  Suspenseful.     I wish I could give you more details about the book, but I don't want to spoil anything.  Gotta read it.  Don't be fooled of the YA category.

B002VECM6S|5.0|The first thing I want to do after seeing The Blind Side is to share this movie with my Sons and friends. We have had foreign exchange students. A fantastic experience. German and Brazilian. This Sandra Bullock movie helps us to see that THIS country needs to offer help to Mikes HERE. I guarantee that we are the ones who are learning. A moving and inspirational movie. Yes, they are all in the business of selling movies, Leigh Anne sells an ideal. Thank You to families and examples like them! Resolve and heart, in a atmosphere still often relating to 1864.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Awesome.  Simply awesome.  If you loved the movie, you'll love this album.    I bought the CD and my PC seemed to have problems playing it.  It would pause frequently.  I ripped the tracks to a hard disk and the performance is now what I would expect from a commercial CD.  You can save some time and serious cash if you simply download the album from Amazon.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|\\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" is a phenomenal 2-CD set. I didn't become interested in Michael Jackson and his music until after his recent tragic death, I'm sorry to say.  I was looking for some sort of \\"all-encompassing\\" CD that would serve as a good intro to his work when I stumbled upon this great CD set.  It turned out to be the perfect fit for me.  Both the sound quality and the selection of tracks are truly excellent.  It appears MJ's full career is well-represented here, with perhaps just a few notable omissions like \\"I'll Be There.\\"  This CD set turned me into an instant MJ fan -- I went out and bought several more MJ and Jackson 5 CDs almost immediately and now enjoy listening to one or more daily.  The dude REALLY knew his stuff, and I now seriously regret that I didn't \\"enlist in the MJ army\\" much sooner than I did.  Anyway, I highly recommend this CD set to all MJ \\"newbies\\" like me and even to seasoned MJ fans who are looking to add to their collections.  You definitely won't be disappointed with this CD purchase.  (Michael, you were a true gift from God.  Rest peacefully, my friend.)
0312370849|2.0|I find it more and more disheartening to see what is considered a \\"great book,\\" the same way I find American politics more and more disheartening.

B0026P3G12|5.0|I became an instant fan when I saw Susan Boyle on u-tube, so I ordered this CD immediately when it became available.

0805091742|5.0|Atul Gawande, a general surgeon and associate professor at Harvard Medical School, uses \\"The Checklist Manifesto\\" to briefly report the need for improvement in surgery, the use of checklists by pilots and their potential applicability to medicine, lessons learned in developing his own checklists, initial improvement results, and examples of potential other areas of use (eg. investments). \\"The Checklist Manifesto\\" is easy general reading, yet also provides detailed hands-on suggestions for practitioners and sources for more guidance. It is must reading for anyone interested in performance improvement.<br /><br />Gawande reports that studies have found that 30% or more of stroke patients receive inappropriate or incomplete care from doctors, as well as 45% with asthma and 60% with pneumonia. Experience, training, and specialization all help ('practice makes perfect'), but are no guarantee of perfection either. The basic problem is medicine's underlying complexity - there are some 13,000 different diseases, syndromes, and types of injury, 6,000+ drugs, and 4,000 some medical and surgical procedures - and the numbers in all three areas grow steadily. Even day-to-day care can be problematic - a study of ICU patients found the average patient required 178 individual actions/day, each with risks of potential error. (Emotional family members, distractions by questions about other patients, patients throwing up, etc. don't help.) Fortunately, checklists can provide significant improvement in patient outcomes - from diagnosis to day-to-care, while also lowering costs.<br /><br />Gawande then provides a brief history of checklists in aviation and illustrations of their use. Drawing upon these experience, as well as suggestions from experts within Boeing that develop such lists, Gawande then details his initial stumbles in developing similar tools for surgery. Fortunately, his openness to suggestions from others (both in the operating room, and outside) soon led to a successful trial across 8 hospitals that dropped major surgical complications by 36%, and deaths by 45%, and gained strong enthusiasm from the staff and physicians involved.8 hospitals that dropped major surgical complications by 36%, and deaths by 45%, and gained strong enthusiasm from the staff and physicians involved.
B002VECLVO|5.0|\\"A Single Man\\" is an achingly beautiful, quiet film about a gay English professor in the 1960s whose partner of 16 years has been killed. Because of the times and his profession, he cannot suffer publicly.  Colin Firth's acting is the reason the film is heartbreakingly touching. He reveals his character haltingly, through his memories and subtle actions. His thoughts and feelings are etched in the aching lines of his face, his wistful smiles, and his desperate preparations for death. Although the film begins to offer hope that this lost man might find himself and love again, there is no happy ending. However, it is a film that I will purchase and watch over and over because of Colin Firth's gentle, elegant, haunting performance.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Believe it or not I've never read Jane Eyre before <shock!>. It's been on my to read list for years and I've just never gotten around to it.  Typically I will always choose to read the book before I ever watch a movie. The books are always so much better ! I've even been known to skip a movie altogether if I have read the book yet ( My Sisters Keeper as an example - I KNOW I want to read the book first and still haven't gotten around to it).     I put this on my list because it is so highly ranked as a period drama you must see. I decided I would go ahead and watch the movie. I did a little research before watching it and read that they took quite a bit of creative liberties with this adaptation and really breezed through her childhood.     I think they really should have spent a little more time at the start of the movie developing her childhood before diving right into her character as an adult. The childhood of Jane Eyre and her need for love is such an important part of the entire story. Ruth Wilson who plays the adult Jane does a wonderful job of conveying her emotions to the watcher.     I'm glad I chose to watch the movie and not wait because it has really lit a fire in me to read the actual novel ! I would rank it a 4/5.
B00003CWPL|5.0|After reading so much about this film, I finally got the chance to see it... what an experience!!! I saw this at midnight, with my laptop and wearing headphones. I was freaked out the whole time but loving every minute of it. It's a hypnotic, unsettling, disturbing, brilliant.... there's nothing like it.    Caution, this is not for everyone. 75% of my friends wouldn't like it for the fact that you really have to love being challenged into interpreting a movie. If you're looking for something like The Ring or House on Haunted Hill, this is NOT for you.     If you haven't seen it, please do so. I also recommend Begotten... not as weird as Eraserhead but equally an unforgettable experience.
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|I bought this CD for myself but I have not been able to get it away from my husband. When we listen to it together, we enjoy it like a piece of art, savior like a fine wine. The lyrics are poetry and the musicianship is extrodinary. Leonard Cohen's humility makes the live performance a charmer. I do believe, the longer you've lived life, the more appreciation you'll have for this music.
B002Q9MZHE|4.0|It feels almost churlish not to give this disc 5 stars, but ... the very noticeable dubbing takes away from the enjoyment of the opera as opera. This is especially bothersome in the first meeting of the two lovers in Act I: the intimacy of the scene is marred by the non-directional origin of the sound. That said, this is a spectacular production, singing and acting superb (the latter better than any production I've seen), and the blu-ray picture quality superb (a very dark pallet, as befits a boy, a girl, and TB). My recommendation: start with Act II. Old-timers, listen to the DVD version and imagine it all in your head. First-timers, you really can't do better than this as an introduction to opera
0156027321|4.0|I've been looking for an angle to add to the Pi Comment-unity.  [SPOILER ALERT]  What I find interesting about Pi is that he maintained a kind of humor even in the face of utter disaster.  The conclusion, where he is interviewed by the Japanese agents, who want the 'real' story, suggest that Pi's 'breezy' account may be fiction as well, along with the 'story' of the animals substituting for the murder of his mother and the cook and the Chinese guy.  Pi's religious obsession can also be called into question in this regard--maybe his passionate devotion he recounts is also just a construct for dealing with the horror he experienced and inflicted.  The Japanese agents agree the one with the animals is the 'better' story, which is probably what most readers would conclude as well.  (Did anybody catch how the Japanese responded to Pi when asked about their own horrorific journey to interview him--they lied(?) and said it was fine.)  Maybe, too, the life with God is the 'better story.'  I think that's explicitly argued for in the book.<br /><br />To some degree, the larger point is that we all need fictions in order to be happy--the 'family,'  the 'good job', the 'being productive', the 'being One', the 'good cause', etc.  It's like Sinatra said: \\"I'm for anything that gets you through the night.\\" Our 'real stories' are often just sad and heartbreaking.<br /><br />People get through life in various ways.  What is even more interesting is not which story is more 'interesting', but whether a book with both stories is better than just one or the other.  I think so, in the sense that the reader can be asked to check in with his or her own story, and see what other stories may lie embedded in the same huge lump of facticity.
0307454541|5.0|This book kept me guessing. It took some surprising twists and turns, which I really like in a book.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|For the plot... it was fast-paced and preposterous... what's not to like?

B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Like most people, I expect, when I sat down to watch \\"Up\\" I believed I was going to see a funny cartoon. Fortunately for me this movie turned out to be so much more.  Now I understand that animated movies aren't all \\"just for children.\\" There have been animated movies made for a more mature audience for as long as movies have been made. But I don't see \\"Up\\" as being made for a mature audience, merely for a thoughtful one(besides, anyone with children know just how much they resent being talked down to).   \\"Up\\", to me, is about dealing with loss. Each of the five main characters has to deal with some type of loss and this is the meat of the movie. There are comedic moments and they are wonderful but I found myself being engaged by the cast as each struggles with his own issue and does, or doesn't work through it.   I found this an enjoyable movie, very entertaining.
0385532458|5.0|The first time I read an early work by John Grisham, I wondered how I'd ever last until the next book came out.  Over time, I lost that feeling. Perhaps too many \\"lawyer novels\\" on the market had something to do with that.<br /><br />\\"Ford County\\" sent me back to that earlier time. Even while I was savoring the stories I had just read, turning the last page filled me with longing and regret that there were no more of these wonderful stories to read.<br /><br />Although set in the same fictional town as one of his early novels, I don't believe Grisham could have written these short stories earlier in his career-- not as well, anyway. This is the work of a mature writer, well-practiced.  The stories are powerfully written, the characters well-drawn with an economy of words.  The plots are perfect; there's not much time for meandering plots in short fiction, yet these stories really go places in such a short amount of time.<br /><br />Humor, irony, sweetness, tragedy-- it's all here in Ford County.  Highly recommended.
6300251616|5.0|One of my favorite movies. It's so far out, it's in. Love the alien/beach ball sequence. That's the funniest scene ever in a sci-fi movie.
159562015X|5.0|I've taken a lot of personality and character tests such as Myers-Brigg and I've always come out being skeptical about the results, not so much with this book.  As I examined my life, attributes, and preferences, this book really explained a lot about myself and why I do the things I do.  It has given me a bit more insight of the career I should choose and people I should hang around with.  I recommend this book for anyone who's unsure about who they really are, what they should do in life, and/or are just plain curious on what their strengths are.  I liked this book so much I bought 3 more copies after my first one to give as gifts to people around me...
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The video arrived in less than 48 hours. It was undamaged and it has performed optimally. Amazon did a great job with delivering the product ordered swiftly.<br /><br />JJ Abrams did his homework for this film. It is a special effects giant. Even CG effects look real. The film was also excellent from a casting perspective. Except for Scotty, the characters closely resembled those from the original TV series and the early ST films.<br /><br />Although the movie is a spectacular success, there are a few weaknesses. Eric Bana might have been poorly cast for the villain. He did not seem as evil as the character required. The screenplay was mediocre. It's obvious that the writers had the next movie in mind when they wrote this screenplay. We know, for example, that the planets Vulcan and Romulus exist in the future; yet they were destroyed in this film. One can only assume, therefore, that the next film has already been written and involves time travel or manipulation of the timeline in order to reverse the damage from this one.<br /><br />Other loose ends include the \\"amazing\\" explosion that saved the Enterprise at the end, but did not destroy it (and with no warp core, how did they get home?), the amazing \\"rescue\\" of the Kelvin survivors (why didn't Bana destroy them?), having two Spocks together, but at different ages and how did Bana's character fabricate such a huge and advanced spacecraft, much less stock it with talented officers and crew? The hate-relationship between Nimoy and Bana could have been more deeply explored.<br /><br />Nevertheless, from the standpoint of cinematography, Star Trek is visually stunning. JJ Abrams is a capable director and, like all Star Trek films, humorous at times. Kirk's character was well developed, including a heart-pounding car theft by Kirk as a child. Kirk is seen as a petulant, angry, bored juvenile, drifting through life without purpose or meaning. One interesting surprise was a romantic relationship between Uhura and the young Spock, which greatly irritated Kirk. Abrams gave us what we expected, even if the screenplay reveals the next movie at the same time. There is plenty of eye candy for Trekkies and this period of time at Starfleet (after Enterprise, yet before the original TV series) was well explored and developed.<br /><br />Charles Weinblatt<br />Author, Jacob's Courage: A Holocaust Love StoryAbrams gave us what we expected, even if the screenplay reveals the next movie at the same time.

B0007OY2MG|5.0|More fun and drama abound in the third season of this smartly written series, with the Lorelais dealing with many conflicts--some of their own making--involving Richard and Emily, the self-destructive Jess, explosive Paris Geller, and more.    Rory shows her academic smarts but isn't too good at picking guys to fall in love with, while Lorelai and Luke seem to be edging closer to each other.   In the meantime, the inn burns severely, leaving Lorelai and the hilarious, high-strung Sookie to hatch plans for a new place that they can manage together.    The one character I find tragic is Lane Kim, who is musically gifted and spirited, but this spirit is crushed by her overly strict mother.
0060589280|5.0|I bought this book in Russia in the Russian translation and finally got to read it after it sat on my bookshelf for a couple of years. To say that I liked this book is to not say anything at all. I enjoyed it so much and wish I could have read it in Portuguese because I am sure a lot is lost in translation. This book is about so many different themes including passion, forbidden love, sex, intimacy, friendship, making the right decisions, and nostalgia. I couldn't put it down. The reader can't but sympathize with the protagonist, Maria, a young woman from Brazil who moves to Switzerland and ends up becoming a prostitute. This is the second book I read by Paulo Coelho, and I can't wait to read another one to have a new encounter with this amazing author.

Great music and great playing but I like watching steve and the band move around more from one end of the stage to the other. I like watching guitar tricks and stunts with other members of the band. I like a show to go with the music. Though this concert is great in a musical sence but it lacks the stage presence of a show.<br /><br />Ill give this a 9 out of 10
B002G1K82Q|5.0|The fabulous [[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]] reminds me of a time in my life.  In the story, Jude, a young dockworker, (portrayed by Jim Sturgess) leaves Liverpool to find his estranged father in America, but when he arrives, he is soon swept up in a wave of change that is reshaping the nation.  And, of course, he finds love.  Evan Rachel Wood portrays Lucy, a rich but sheltered American girl who joins the growing anti-war movement.<br /><br />Watching the two of them as they explore this rapidly changing world, and even when they are caught up in a psychedelic universe in a world gone mad, I was captivated.<br /><br />Like Alice falling down the rabbit hole, these two are buffeted about as they attempt to redefine their universe.<br /><br />Worth watching just for the music, if for nothing else, this movie is more than the romantic trials and tribulations, the political fervor, and even the music--it reflects an iconic moment in America's history.<br /><br />I would grant five stars to this flick.

0307454541|2.0|I was excited to read this book because of all the hype.  The first 120 pages were mind numbingly boring.  I had hoped there was a reason for this mind freeze later in the book, but there wasn't.  The editor was apparently on vacation when this portion was submitted.  The author also never developed any of the murder suspects except for  four or five out of fifteen or so.  Plus  all of their last names were Vanger.  One of the main characters however, he would often simply refer to as Vanger but the rest were also Vangers.  Also, the last portion of the book was a huge letdown.  I gave it an extra star because the author died and I was being nice.

There are very few movie soundtracks that I'd recommend ([[ASIN:B000002H4C Heavy Metal]], [[ASIN:B00000IFW8 The Matrix]], and [[ASIN:B00004TRSU Mission Impossible 2]] are others), but this is /definitely/ one of them.<br /><br />The only two real disappointments with the CD are the fact that the song \\"Can't Rain All the Time\\" is not the version played by Hangman's Joke in the movie, but instead is some very mellow thing that sounds like it came out of [[ASIN:B00007BKVC Thelma & Louise]] rather than this movie. The other disappointment is that the rocking guitar work done by 'Eric' in the movie (on the roof, before the office fight) isn't included.<br /><br />Other than that... a lot of great stuff to blow out your speakers with. Rage Against the Machine (their usual kick-butt anti-discrimination rants), Helmet (cranked up crunching), \\"Golgotha Tenement Blues\\" by Machines of Loving Grace (one of the most recognizable songs in the movie), the Christian rock of For Love Not Lisa (\\"Slip Slide Melting\\"), \\"Time Baby III\\" by Medicine (the live version in the movie is slightly better, but this is still decent), and the excellent zombie stomp energy of \\"After the Flesh\\" by My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult (my favorite song on the whole album... juiced up head banging).<br /><br />There's the highland semi-monotone \\"Snakedriver\\" by The Jesus And Mary Chain, the egotistical \\"Dead Souls\\" by NIN (entirely written, performed and produced by Trent Reznor), \\"Burn\\" by The Cure (which could easily be the title track from the movie - probably the loudest thing they've ever done), and a fairly decent one from Stone Temple Pilots (\\"Big Empty\\").

B001CZVVV4|5.0|Blu Ray is the way to see opera if you have a big screen TV and an excellent sound system. You get to see the singer's facial expressions, the look in their eyed, all the nuances of their performances. The cast here is outstanding, especially Anna Netrebko and Eric Cutler who looks so adoringly at Anna when he sings to her, you really believe he's in love with her. Both of their voices are superb as are their vocal gymnastics -- this is Bel Canto-- and their control is extraordinary
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I have now read all of Dan Brown's books. LOST SYMBOL is creative and a page turner, as are his other books. I found the end to drag on forever in this case, though. If you like his other books, I believe you will enjoy this.
B002RI9L76|5.0|How anyone can not like this book or the characters is beyond me! Richard Adams manages to capture everyone's desire for freedom, love, friendship and doing away with bullies. He writes with urgency too, so that whether he's writing about a danger the rabbits are facing or telling a funny story you become caught up in the moment. Yes it's a story about rabbits, but it's so much more - those that can't see that aren't in touch with their inner child! Read and enjoy!
B000LXHK2C|3.0|This is a \\"nice\\" movie, ultimately a romance, that has several excellent actors, Russell Crowe, Marion Cotillard (who's also wonderful to look at), and Albert Finney. Crowe plays Max, a highly successful investment  manager, who works in the fast-paced trading environment in London, and inherits a villa with vineyard in the beautiful hills of Provence, France. He visits his new property and meets Fanny, an attractive cafe hostess whom he had previously known as a child while living in the villa of his now-deceased uncle. Of course, love blossoms and now Max must choose between the lush, laid-back life of a country gentleman managing the wines, or the plastic corporate executive gig devoid of real meaning. In between answering his annoying business cell phone, Crowe does a credible job considering the light subject matter and even makes mild attempts at humor that for me seemed a little silly. The film moves along at a slow but reasonable pace considering the theme, but may lack the essence to encourage a second viewing.

B000MNP2KI|2.0|This is the worst example ever of the Bond series. Craig just doesn't live up to the character played by Connery for 20 years (few do). Connery's Bond was always on the offensive with women; in the scene with Caterina Murino, she's in charge and the two seem almost self-conscious; at least things liven up when Eva Green arrives on the set. The movie has too many uninteresting characters and what else can they do but flip an occasional evil eye. There's too many gambling scenes that look too serious and too many close-ups of players hands, as if trying to show that damn, this game really means something. That can happen when the story is weak. There's too many close-ups of cell phones, showing messages that supposedly add to the meaningless script. It seemed that the combo of Judy Dench as \\"M\\", who should have stayed in the background more, and Craig as Bond did not really work. I was surprised this turned out to be such a poor effort since the director, Martin Campbell, also did Golen Eye (1995) which I liked. One star to qualify, one for Eva Green.
B00005RFUX|5.0|Love at first sting makes a great argument for being the Scorpions best album. This album went in an more advanced direction musically and is my favorite. The sad thing was the follow up album featuring \\"winds of change\\" was a huge disappointment and brought the end of my days buying new Scorpions CDs. The best albums were Blackout, Love at First Sting and Savage Amusement. If you like the Scorpions its a must have; although its hard to find.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I had been wanting to get Planet Earth for a while now, but when I saw that Amazon had a holiday price of $40 compared to it's original $100 I knew I just had to get it; and i was not disappointed. The thing that i appreciate most about the movie is that it takes you to places that many probably will never get to visit; but with such high definition footage able to be viewed through blu-ray, i often find myself taking a closer look at the screen trying to remind myself that it's indeed just a movie. :D
B001AUKUS6|5.0|Out of the Cellar is a great album and features a lot of hit songs. The guitar work and song writing were even better on this album and featuring a bit more edge while maintaining the melodic vocal hooks from Out of the Cellar. This is my favorite Ratt album and a must have for any Ratt aficionado.

B002GJT4XW|2.0|I would have given this 5 stars except that for some reason, the In-Movie Experience would not play.  I could play both movies (theatrical version and extended) but not this Special Feature.  The strange thing is, that I couldn't get the In-Movie Experience to pay on my Year 2 blue ray disc either!  Has anyone else had this problem?  I am going to return them in exchange for new copies and hopefully it will work and I can make this a 5 star review!!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I saw Sherlock Holmes at my local theater and immediatley loved it. There is only one word to describe this film and that word is \\"brilliant\\".     The story takes place in Victorian England with a young detective named sherlock Holmes (Robert Downing Jr.) and his doctor named Watson. The film picks up at a mysterious temple in wich a human sacrifice is taking place. Luckely for the one being sacrificed Holmes, Watson, and the police come just in time to stop the killing.  The sacrifice was being performed by a devil-worshipper known as Lord Blackwood.  Blackwood is immediatley arrested and brought to trial for the murder of several women. He is sentenced to death and is hung. Later they bring the body to Watson and he pronounces Blackwood dead. But several days later a witness sees Blackwood rise from the grave in the local graveyard. Blackwood continues his killings and his powers are rapidly inflicting fear on the people of England. He plans to use this fear in order to in a way take over the world. Luckely Sherlock Holmes is such a brilliant detective that he can notice every minor detail in this case.     I highly recommend this movie. It is action-packed, frightning, and even hilarious. Although you my need to see the movie more than once, the plot is very difficult to grasp.
B0006GANN2|4.0|I was 7 or 8 yrs old at that time during the actual screening of this version . I can`t understand the whole thing at the time, now I`m 49 yrs old and begun to wonder and understand that drug dealing is more dangerous b4 than at present, with a very dedicated cop as Gene Hackman, if only this film be shwn to the present police set up, only then they can ralize how the power of the will can turn or pin down criminals. I appreciate what Gene Hackman had portrayed in this film. I salute him. I wonder if any one of those police setup can match the integrity of police forces b4, dealing with narcotics syndicate.

0743298039|5.0|This book is ideal for readers who enjoy the classic eighteenth century novels, and more specifically for a smaller number who treasure books as fine works of art. Most of these kinds of readers will find an empathetic connection to the narratior, which then aids in further pulling you into the thick story plot. This tale is sweet, shocking, comical, horrific, and heralds a romance about storytelling itself. Read it, you'll love it.    As a side note, if you have not yet read Jane Eyre (I had not before reading this story), read it immediately preceding or immediately following this book. The Thirteenth Tale makes written connection to Jane Eyre on several occasions, and knowing Charlotte Bronte's novel gives the scenes in The Thirteenth Tale a deeper meaning, making the read that much more enjoyable.
0743298039|5.0|From page 1 right to the end, Diane Setterfield enraptured my mind with a story about a story intertwined with several stories. The secrets, the ghosts, the books, and the people transported me to various places and times. I was filled with an anxiety, a need, to solve the puzzle of The Thirteenth Tale by Vida Winters as the clues were laid before Margaret Lea and me, the reader. How can you really talk about this book other than it was a great book that I have to have for my bookshelf and one that I know I'll want to read again another time and perhaps another?? My emotions were were twisted and twisted as I read this novel. Towards the end I THOUGHT I had it figured out only to realize I completely missed things earlier in the stories. THAT'S a good book. One that throws me off, one that grabs and twists my emotions, and one that touches my soul as a sister...FIVE STARS!!
B001ILHY1I|4.0|As many of you may have suspected, this is a remake (of sorts) of Roger Corbin's cult classic [[ASIN:6304864264 Death Race 2000]].  Of course, this one has some twists to it.  First off, in the original the drivers were all competing for prize $$ (if I remember correctly?).  In this one, they're lifers in prison whose only chance of getting out is to win 5 races.<br /><br />Like the original, the \\"racing\\" is filled with violence, although the present version has much more intense violence than the campy violence of the 1970s flick.  Also like the original, women ride along too, only in this one they're the navigators for the men.  They, of course, are female inmates who have the capability of \\"punching out\\" of the vehicle should things go badly.  Not too surprisingly, the navigators are all smokin' hot as the deathrace is broadcast on PPV & video-streamed on the Internet.  Hot babes + souped up cars + violence drives up ratings!<br /><br />Unfortunately, the present movie lacks a staple of Roger Corbin movies which the original did not omit: gratuitous nudity.  That's too bad, especially as they made an Unrated version.  But, guess you can't have everything.<br /><br />Jason Statham is one of the better action hero actors out there now (most of the others are too old and / or have retired, and John Cena can't act).  If you like Statham movies in general, you're bound to like this one.  If you enjoyed the original Deathrace, then this one is worth a look.  Enjoy, but watch out for the flying bullets!
1582701709|3.0|I believe The Secret gives too much credit to the universe and the law of attraction, and not enough to God's will and human strength and spirit. However, the authors are limited in their theological input because this book must appeal to people of all faiths worldwide.<br /><br />That's not to say that this book does not have value in helping us achieve our goals and pursue our dreams. I really like the emphasis on gratitude and the power of positive thinking. We cannot fulfill our dreams from a place of fear, anxiety and hopelessness. I started using the vision board over a year ago as a motivational tool with the following photos:<br />1) A picture of my aging dog at an earlier stage in life to symbolize youth, vitality and good health.<br />2) A check for $1.5 million.<br />3) The New York Times Bestseller list with my new book copied and pasted into the #1 slot.<br />4) My face photoshopped onto a slender model's picture to help me visualize the physique I would like to have.<br /><br />After looking at these photos daily, here are the results:<br />1) My 9 1/2 year old dog is in better shape than he was when I adopted him at age 4. His hip dysplasia is better as a result of weight management, frequent walks to build the muscles around his hips, nutritional supplements, and lots of TLC. He has never needed prescription medication.<br />2) The $1.5 million has yet to arrive, but I'm not giving up!<br />3) My book is nowhere near the top of the bestseller list, but it was just released last month. I am trying to be patient and optimistic.<br />4) I don't have the model's physique - yet! But I have lost 20 lbs during the last 4 months and hope to lose another 12 - 15 lbs.<br /><br />I have seen greater success in achieving the goals over which I have some control. The $1.5 million and the bestseller list are a little harder to control and I feel like I'm shooting at a moving target. But I do believe that the daily affirmations and visualizations of success have helped me with the more attainable goals. I also feel much calmer and more confident when I begin each day with thoughts of gratitude as The Secret suggests. This book is definitely worth a read if you can approach the lessons realistically.uch calmer and more confident when I begin each day with thoughts of gratitude as The Secret suggests.

034537410X|3.0|Overall, I liked the book but was really frustrated with the author's conclusions that lucid dreams can all be explained away as just mere brain activity: The typical scientific reductionism.
B001W3R494|5.0|This is an excellent, fairly priced, interesting rendering of D's work. The negative review (a 1 star) by a downloader does not give justice to the CDs. He/she got ripped off when a download of DHS resulted to be else, and thus gave a negative review score. How does this glitch relate to the CD and the artists involved remains a mystery, and since nobody has time to worry about this, I propose, as others have, to REMOVE THE SCORE! Thanks.
B000JSI7C6|4.0|I have seen this movie several times and I just finished the blu ray version, which is nice. There are moments of war movie \\"greatness\\" in this picture. The opening scenes in the Solomons with close quarter bayonet fighting are well done. The opening scenes of the invasian of Saipan are also great with an impressive eye for detail in regards to the scope of the battlefield. You can see Corsairs flying low and dropping their payload on Japanese bunkers. The fighting is intense and both armies take heavy losses in an intense confrontation. Towards the end of the movie the Japanese pull out heavy cannons that level Sherman tanbks at will, its great footage. The acting is well done too. But the problems are someimes hard to overlook. Too many times Japanese guys have Cage and his Navejo code talkers surrounded only to be shot to smithereens. In one scene towards the end, Cage uses his pistol to shoot 4 guys in an instant with their guns drawn. Not likely. And you can only see so many scenes where a grenade goes off sending 2 or 3 soldiers flying 10 feet in the air. This movie has a high body count and plenty of carnage, it isn't as concentrated as Saving Private Ryans first 30 minutes, however it easily tops that movie in overall killing. The story of the Indian code talkers and their role in the Pacific War is finally displayed here. I would rate this movie somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. It could have easily gotten 5 if it was tightened up a bit. I give it 4 for the great scenes and the fact that the Pacific war has so few movies for some reason. Here are some that you may know and some you may not.     The Battle Of Okinawa- a Japanese movie from 1971 very good  Letters From Iwo Jima- One of my favortes- Ken Wattanabe is great  Kukudo- An Australian movie, interesting, but not always accurate  Flags Of Our Fathers- Very good  Planetes Yamato- a good movie about the Yamato and its suicide mission at Okinawa- Japanese  I go die for you- A movie about the kamikaze- Japanese    A Thin Red Line- I like this one, but not everyone does. Good battle scenes
0061914177|5.0|What this book does best is open your eyes to the vast possibilities of social marketing. Don't think you know it already. The book is inspiring to say the least! The author stresses the importance of living a passionate life and keeping it real - VERY REAL. I'm not exactly new to this subject but I found it excellent nevertheless. You'll get a great springboard for further reading with this one. Go get it regardless of your background. One of the best books I've read over the past 5 years (300 or so books during that period). I highly recommend it.
B000MCH5P4|3.0|There are four vignettes here - two in Morocco, one in Southern California and Mexico, and one in Japan.  It's the path of a rifle that loosely binds the tales together.  [Some of it's a stretch, frankly.]  I enjoyed three of the plotlines, especially the Japanese stuff.  Rinko Kikuchi is spectacular as a deaf mute teenager, and it's a treat to see Kôji Yakusho.  [Who can forget him in [[ASIN:B0002V7S34 Shall We Dance?]]] Director Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu does his best work in those scenes I think.  As spectacular as the Moroccan mountainside scenes are, the passages from Kikuchi's viewpoint are fabulous...as are his sequences that get to the heart of the unrelenting crush of Tokyo life.<br /><br />Like I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga's partnership in [[ASIN:B0001CNRRU 21 Grams]], Babel is anything but linear in its telling.  Tony Gilroy does the same thing in [[ASIN:B00121QGPY Michael Clayton (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0029RVZGU Duplicity]], but he gives you little cues (\\"2 weeks earlier\\"...that type of thing).  Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga don't do that.  Until you catch on it can be confusing.  The viewer needs to piece the sequence together.  After you get it, it's neat to watch it all fall together.<br /><br />The one part of the film I soured on: any time Brad Pitt appeared on screen.  I'm not anti-Brad Pitt.  I've enjoyed him in many things.  But here, he's visibly straining To Be Meaningful in an Important Movie.  It's off-putting.  Whenever I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu went back to him, I twiddled my thumbs, looked elsewhere...and waited for the focus to shift back to characters for whom I cared.

1408802473|4.0|Ordinary Thunderstorms starts off like a conventional fast-paced thriller. Adam Kindred (a climatologist who studies clouds) is dining alone in London after a job interview. He makes casual conversation with the man at the next table, research scientist Philip Wang. When Wang leaves, Adam realizes that he has left behind a file in the restaurant and decides to return it to Wang's home. However when he gets to Wang's apartment, he discovers that Wang has been stabbed and is dying. He also realizes that there is someone still in the apartment. He panics and flees with the file. After wandering the streets for a few hours, he decides to return home and contact the police. But there is an armed man waiting for him and this causes him to run again and go into hiding. He's a wanted man: his fingerprints were at the scene. Can he clear his name before the murderer catches up with him?<br /><br />All of this happens in the very first chapter. But rather than continuing at this pace, the story slows right down, almost stalling. We are introduced to a series of disparate characters whose connection to the main plot are not always obvious. There is Ingram Fryzer, head of the pharmaceutical company that employed Philip Wang. Rita Nashe, a policewoman who discovers Wang's body the day before she transfers to the Marine Support Unit. Mhouse, a prostitute living in a housing estate. And Jonjo Case, the ruthless murderer who is determined to track Kindred down. They are not all likable individuals but they are fully realized - real people. Then slowly, masterfully, Boyd cranks the tension up. The individual strands start to come together, although they don't always do so in the way you expect them to (or the way that they would in a John Grisham novel for example). Adam is a terrific hero: resourceful and quick thinking but still very much an ordinary man.<br /><br />Ordinary Thunderstorms reads like a literary version of The Fugitive. Adam needs to find a way to survive in hiding while piecing together the evidence that can clear him. Ultimately it's a hugely satisfying read with great characters and a wonderful sense of place. I wouldn't describe it as a fast paced thriller, but as the tension builds it does become a very hard book to put down. The ending is perfectly satisfactory but also leaves you wanting more.gether the evidence that can clear him.

1439138311|3.0|I loved the beginning of this book but the main characters behavior in the last third of this book shows that the author does not know women at all. Eilis is so quick to throw away her feelings for Tony because a bar owner is nice to her? Also the episode with Ms. Fontini and the bathing suit, what? Where did that story line make any sense or have any relevance to the overall story?     The details in the book were rich and well done. The writting is great but the story line was not believable. Overall, I would read it again just for the beginning.
0786838655|5.0|I am a fourth grade teacher and I'm reading the first book in the Percy Jackson and the Olympians to my students.  This experience has been as fun for me as it has for them!  My students are mesmerized by each chapter and it's been wonderful watching them devour the books (they're reading the other books in the series at the same time as they can't get enough of the series).  Today while reading, I snuck a peek at the kids and most of them had their mouths open in awe.  They started cheering when they correctly predicted what was going to happen to Annabeth and Grover in the mattress store and they could hardly sit still they were so excited.  They groan when I put down the book and the whole experience has truly been magical.  I highly recommend this book as a read aloud for 4th or 5th graders (or older, it's a great story).  They're excited about Greek mythology and rush to tell me whenever they've found a connection from something else in the outside world.  I am a devoted Harry Potter fan but having read both of these series to ten year olds, I can say that the Percy Jackson series is a magical read.    I'm sad that the movie is coming out in February of 2010 as it does take the magic of discovery away.  On the other hand, it's a great lesson for my current students in how the movie is never the same as the book.  They're already outraged by a theater trailer depicting Annabeth as a brunette (she's blonde with curly hair in the book).  Just wait until they see the movie!
1594488878|2.0|I think the most succinct way I can sum up my impression of this novel is to say that if it wasn't written by Nick Hornby, I would've put it down after about page fifty or so -- because deep down I knew it wasn't going anywhere.  I've often wondered if one's creative reservoir is a finite thing; if sooner or later all artists tap out of anything interesting to say to the world -- and if they continue to produce work beyond that point, it tends to be of the Empty Crap variety.  Or maybe it's something different.  Maybe great art requires the ingredients of pain and struggle, and when an artist achieves fame and fortune and life gets easier for them, they find those ingredients suddenly out of reach.  (Unless they do heroine or something -- in which case the pain and struggle remain close at hand.  See:  Kurt Cobain and John Belushi).  But whatever the reason, with the creation of Juliet, Naked, Nick Hornby's work has achieved Empty Crap status.    Shame, really.  I mean, I still consider About A Boy, and High Fidelity two of my favorite novels of all time.  And even though I found How To Be Good and A Long Way Down somewhat meandering and flawed, they were still compelling reads.  Oh -- and my eleven year-old son completely dug Slam.  So I'll give Hornby that one, as well.    But just because you've written some good stuff before, doesn't mean you should just write anything you want and toss it out to general public for consumption.  That's how you lose readers.  Because in my opinion, that's exactly what Hornby did with this novel.      Here's what I got out of it:  1. English seaside town-dwelling couple live together.  Guy is borderline-obsessed with a former American musician of minor celebrity.  Lady finds the music somewhat compelling, but is unfulfilled with the relationship with her boyfriend and finds his obsession difficult to stomach.  She also longs for a child.  2. Rehearsal sessions of the musician's all-time greatest album turn up. Boyfriend loves them; girlfriend hates them.  She writes a review on the internet saying so.  3. Through the stupid actions of the boyfriend, the relationship falls apart and somewhere in there (I'm trying not to give away the story here, so I'm being intentionally vague) girlfriend finds herself in contact with the American musician.    Sound compelling?  Not to me.  But, admittedly, I'm not really a music nut.  Beyond that, though, there's no goal to the novel; no burning need for any of the characters to achieve or overcome anything.  And THAT violates good storytelling guidelines in my opinion.  In About A Boy, Will wanted first to be left alone, and then to find a meaningful connection with another human being -- while Marcus needed to learn how to become a kid.  In High Fidelity, Rob sought a) to get his girlfriend back, and b) to find out why he kept getting dumped.  But the three main characters who the author follows around in Juliet (IE: Boyfriend; Girlfriend; Musician [it's written from the third person omniscient POV])don't seem to have any purpose.  Oh, the girlfriend wants a baby, but she doesn't fight to overcome obstacles to achieve that goal.  The boyfriend WANTS his girlfriend back, but doesn't seem to NEED to have her back.  And the musician?  I don't think he wants or seeks anything.  Or if he does, it's never made clear.    Now obviously I'm not going to give away the ending, but I think it suffices to say it was a bit like reaching the California town of Fresno, after a boring trip along I-5.  There's nothing there.    Sorry, Hornby.  No more gift cards wasted on your books until you can show that you haven't jumped the shark.  The next novel of yours' I crack open will be a library copy.  That way I won't feel like I wasted any money if it turns out to be as bad as this one.
B000M34CLI|3.0|Some of the great John Williams themes from the other Harry Potter movies can be found in this track. However, overall I felt this track didn't strengthen the movie quite as much. In particular, there's no memorable tracks for the spiders or basilisk. Every great monster should have its own musical theme, but those parts are largely silent or just retreads. I'd recommend getting one of the other Potter soundtracks, unless you're a diehard Potter fan.

B0028OA2I6|3.0|This second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments. I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.     I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.     Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.     Overall, this is probably tied with \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" as my least favorite in the series. It's definitely worth watching if you like the Harry Potter movies, but should have been much better.
0743277708|5.0|I was very disapionted to read all the negative views about this book. This is a wonderful read. One of those rare books that you will pick up, reread again, and find something new in it you didn't notice the first time. This is also based on how wild rabbits behave in the wild. So yes, it would be natural for the male bunnies to view females as 'breeding stock.' However, if you do read into what the bucks are saying about the females, esp the hutch rabbits, they do show some general concern for their welfare. They are just not a romantic species. Believe you, i breed rabbits, and that point is very true. Boy bunnies generally do not care about the females unless they can mate wth them. They do not give a flip about female rights.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading it. This is beautfully written book. The portrayal of the countryside the rabbits wander thoughis excellent. They have adventures one right after th eother that makes you want to skip ahead a few pages to see if they will be OK.

B00001OH80|4.0|I have always felt this album underrated, and have been mystified as to why it inspires such criticism.  Even from Bowie himself.  I've read Bowie interviews where he's dissed his music of the Let's Dance phase of his career, and those that followed shortly thereafter, i.e., Tonight, and Never Let Me Down.  Neither of these latter albums were terribly consistent, nor were they terrible.    Specific to Tonight, personally I liked all the tracks, with some being \\"filler\\" between stronger tracks.  I'd rank Loving the Alien among the better of Bowie's work in general, and had it been included on a stronger, more coherently themed album it probably would have been received better.  One reviewer described God only Knows as cheap, which surprises me, but to each their own.  Personally, I enjoyed that cover a lot, and while melodramatic in my opinion, I didn't feel it had crossed the border to cheap or tacky.    Another reviewer made a nice point that \\"albums that suck\\" are not always equal to albums you personally disliked.  Still another noted that if 80's pop is not your bag, you might not be thrilled with this one.  I tend to concur with those ideas and would recommend a listen if you bypassed this album due to negative reviews.  You might find a few faves among the tracks.

B002NUZ93S|5.0|I discovered PT recently, while listening to Pandora Ice (Camel) channel and Waiting (PT, Signify) came up and I got hooked. Since then I tried to catch up. People say PT is the new PF and I agree. PT gives you the same level of sophistication you get from PF. This album is probably the closest they get. \\"Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape\\" is a gem. Well done.
B000X9MFDI|3.0|The second installment in the Harry Potter series has some fun moments. I love the character of Gilderoy Lockhart. He's well played and adds humor to the movie. Hagrid's character also gets some more development.     I'm not as crazy about the plot. It's a bit too convoluted, and much of it is never really explained well (even after watching \\"Half-Blood Prince,\\" I still don't understand how Voldemort could have controlled Ginny Weasley or lived through a book). Dobby was really annoying. He's way too dramatic and a sadomasochist to boot. Would anybody really believe that programming a ball to attack and almost kill Harry Potter was really going to succeed in keeping him away from Hogwarts? It just doesn't add up.     Also, the basilisk and spiders were somewhat disappointing and pretty dull. The spiders aren't as exciting as Shelob in Lord of the Rings. The basilisk was somewhat believable, but sometimes looked like a big movie prop. Maybe a special edition could be released with better monster designs.     Overall, this is probably tied with \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" as my least favorite in the series. It's definitely worth watching if you like the Harry Potter movies, but should have been much better.
1416509798|3.0|I gave 'The Woman in White' a try after reading about Willkie Collins and the 'sensation novel' craze of Victorian England, in Kate Summerscale's non-fiction book, 'The Suspicions of Mr. Whicher'. After reading Collins' work in full, I can see where Ms. Summerscale's penchant for long-windedness must have come from!  'The Woman in White' is an excellent story, with a suspenseful premise, intriguing characters, and more than a few twists and turns along the way. Unfortunately, it also seems very bloated with verbiage that sometimes enhances the story, but more often, only  slows it down. The biggest criticism is that it packs 250 pages of solid plotting, characterization, action and intrigue, into a 500-plus-page format! I don't mind 'leisurely pacing', but there were times when Collins' meandering style reminded me of being a 'captive audience' at a lecture!  The 'epistolary' format of the story is an interesting touch, although several of the charcters' perspectives add little or nothing to the story, which is driven by Walter, Marian, and Count Fosco. and could just as easily have been told entirely from their perspectives.  Those who persevere and finish this book will find it is worth the effort!

0385504225|5.0|THE SETUP<br />Peter Solomon, the director of the Smithsonian Institution, is abducted by a strange person named Abadon, partly for the purpose of forcing symbologist Robert Langdon to help him (Abadon) discover the ultimate secret of Freemasonry, which Abadon believes is all he needs to be transformed into a genuine immortal demon.  Abadon has a vendetta with the Solomon family, having murdered Peter's mother some years earlier.  Peter's sister Catherine (a noetics researcher) joins Langdon in the search for Peter, which requires unraveling the Masonic symbolic mysteries of Washington D.C.  That's the setup.  Additional details would be spoilers.<br /><br />COMMENT<br />What many, perhaps most, readers fail to realize is that the Robert Langdon novels all have exactly the same theme.  The theme is an \\"alternate\\" (alternate to the government-approved version of spirituality taught by the priests to the masses) spiritual tradition which predates Christianity, and which is continued in little-known Christian sects (as well as within obscure Jewish and Islamic sects).  Virtually every detail in Brown's novels is  accurate (to the extent such details have been previously published), including the history of the sects, the descriptions of the doctrines, the symbols, and descriptions of ancient traditions.  These traditions represents the theology of the \\"enlightened\\" from Pythagoras to Dante to DiVinci to Thomas Jefferson.  While the corresponding doctrines of some sects in the tradition are open to debate, the tradition is never-the-less historical reality.  \\"The Lost Symbol\\" concentrates on Freemasonry, which while not exactly a religious sect, nevertheless identifies with this tradition.  For example some groups within the large umbrella of Freemasons call themselves Knights Templar---which historically was a (renegade?) monastic order of the Roman Catholic Church.<br /><br />Since publication, Masons have refuted some details, but Brown was accurate to the extent that details had previously been published at the time he wrote the novel.  Mythology and allegory are major components of Masonry. My understanding is that few (if any) Masons themselves know exactly where Masonic mythology ends and real history begins, so we should cut Brown a little slack on that score.<br /><br />In a way, a theme of \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is heresy and heretics.  (By the way, the literal, not figurative, meaning of \\"heretic\\" is \\"one who thinks for himself\\").  In \\"The DiVinci Code\\" and \\"Angels & Demons,\\" Brown presented ideas considered heretical by the Catholic Church.  Therefore Brown was reviled by Catholics and became the darling of progressive liberals, who just accepted the spirituality as necessary fiction (as a vehicle) for the anti-Catholic tirade.  However, in \\"The Lost Symbol\\" (and actually in the earlier Langdon novels as well) Brown has presented ideas heretical to progressive liberalism (e.g., that evil may actually exist, the assertion that spirituality has value, and the historical fact that \\"rational spirituality\\" been a major force in the world since antiquity, and remains so). It is Brown's blasphemous challenge of established ideology which has earned \\"The Lost Symbol\\" so many negative reviews.  Hell hath no fury like a progressive liberal rebuffed.<br /><br />It is remarkable that revolutionaries almost always end up perpetuating and even exacerbating the evils they rebelled against.  Modern progressive liberals are far more rigidly doctrinaire and grimly intolerant of dissent than the \\"system\\" which they justifiably rebeled against.  I'm no fan of the Catholic Church, nor even fundamentalist Christianity, but I find progressive liberalism at least equally oppressive.<br /><br />CRITIQUE<br />Although containing numerous minor implausibilities, inconsistences, and at least a few downright errors, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is engaging and entertaining.<br /><br />Such a book requires a straight-man, as played by Robert Langdon.  Langdon is sometimes oddly skeptical of trivial, widely believed (even if unproven) historical assertions.  At other times he is much too quick to accept fantastic claims, based on little or no evidence.  At times Langdon makes brilliant deductions, at other times he is thwarted by the most minor logical challenge.  It might be better to have a \\"Scully\\" and \\"Molder\\" pair to play these rolls.<br /><br />Character development is formulaic, but this is an action novel--far too many authors have listened to critics and ruined perfectly good action novels with wasted pages and chapters of \\"development\\" of uninteresting characters.  Pacing is erratic, but so is that in a roller-coaster ride.  Indeed \\"The Lost Symbol\\" is about the closest literary equivalent of a roller-coaster ride that I can imagine.<br /><br />I found the plot predictable, and solved several of the key mysteries (Abadon's identity and the \\"winding staircase\\") at an early point.  But that did not distract from enjoyment of the story.  Unlike many reviewers, I think that it is good storytelling technique to give the reader the satisfaction of being \\"smarter\\" than the protagonist, at least on some story elements.<br /><br />As in other Brown novels, Brown spends far too much time unnecessarily pushing the high questionable ultimate implications of his theses.  For example, why not (in \\"The DiVinci Code\\") leave some mystery regarding the nature of the Grail?  Brown's interpretation is only one of many.  Similarly, although not a son-of-the-widow, I'm sure that different Masons get different things out of Masonry, and have different beliefs about what the ultimate mysteries may be.  Why not leave some mystery?<br /><br />As purely fictional modern action-mystery, \\"The Lost Symbol\\" rates perhaps 3 1/2 stars.  But as historical fiction, Brown earns another more star for his extraordinary research, and excellent presentation of the historical facts.<br /><br />THE VERDICT<br />The Lost Symbol is a fantastic ride of non-stop suspense, filled with fascinating mysteries.  So much so, that when I finished, I turned back to page one, and started the novel again.ometimes oddly skeptical of trivial, widely believed (even if unproven) historical assertions.

You know what?  She just continues to blow me away!  Her first album is beautiful, I can picture her as a young girl, growing up with some of those songs, sitting by herself playing her piano, and then as a young woman, and then as she is today.  She not only made an album, she gave us all a gift.    It's simply wonderful.

B001OQCV2O|5.0|After talking to 8 people, I got about 8 different streams of thought about what the movie inspired in them. From being upset at how politicians and power brokers would actually use our tax money to save themselves, to thinking about what is coming in the real 2012, to it just being a well done and thrilling flick.     Nobody was bored or thought it was not well executed. The acting fit the director's intended mood of not letting the disasters depress the audience too much. The effects were among the best ever done in cinema. The plot moved along at a brisk pace, and it did make you talk with those who saw it with you about a myriad of subjects and ideas.     Questions of morality will come to mind but the director does not slant them to pander to emotion. Roland wants the viewer to contemplate what 'the right thing to do' may or not be in situations of high stress. You will be giving some thought as to how you might react to life and death situations.     Less weighty but as important, was Woody Harrelson's portrayal of the Endtimes conspiracy expert. He wants the front row seat and gets it. I know, having comedy in a mass destruction film seems out of place, but it does work thanks to Woody's enthusiastic performance.     In real life, the powered elite have and continue to build deep underground bases complete with high speed monorails to link them. They have evolved way beyond just secret bunkers. They again used taxpayer money to get the best of the best for themselves. Many contractors have spoken out about them. They want to be ready for any number of supposed disasters coming around 2012. Huge solar flares, the lining up with the center of the universe, and/or Nibiru with asteroids are all predicted.      For us regular folks, watch this movie and reflect positively on how you would prepare your soul for a great disaster. Or just get a second bag of popcorn and watch it again for the thrills.
