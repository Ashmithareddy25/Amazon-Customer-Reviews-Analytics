B0070Y46UY|2.0|Powerful story, cowardly ending.  The author spends the first 400 pages weaving a story about the nobility of creation and man's relationship with it, then ends the book by saying \\"never mind\\".
B005FISBTO|2.0|The edges on the case are all worn out like its been used a million times, so when i gave it to my hubby for his bday i didn't even open the package yet, so when i seen it was pretty worn out,  but he didn't really care.... but i wasnt too pleased with the case... i thought i was buying a new everything...
1937986039|3.0|Read through the first relevant chapters reads well but I feel needs more photographs and examples to keep the interest up
B009FXIICK|3.0|This is just  like bejeweled.  I think  the music is obnoxious.  I would hope the developers could add some better music and lengthen the &#34;panic time&#34;
B0053O89KG|5.0|So happy that I bought this season.  I truned off cable and I was looking for good shows to watch... This one hits the spot
B00992CF6W|5.0|It was well worth the cost it keeps him entertained for a long time. He can't wait to get on the phone and play
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|My husband had a hard time understanding the storyline. I had to explain to him it wasn't a love story in the traditional sense of boy meets girl, but was a love between a mother and daughter. We recommend it!
B005VPRG10|5.0|Absolute hit with my grandson. Plays with it every day. Many hours of imaginative play.Too bad I gave my son's Star War toys to Good Will ten years ago!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Very nice packaging with a 3d outer sleeve. 3D content looks most excellent. This movie is very enjoyable on many levels. Interesting how this is written by same person who wrote Tarzan.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|For anyone who has not played Settlers before, it wont disappoint. There are a lot of rules but once you get used to it, you'll have a lot of fun.
B0063HBPH6|4.0|I like the story though there is a bit too much detail at times and the authors go off on tangents that are sometimes hard to follow
B005LAIHZY|5.0|From the artwork and trailer I did not see how I would like the movie. Once I started watching the movie I loved the voice acting, the beautiful art and graphics. The story is very touching once it reaches the point of no return. It is a very enjoyable movie for the whole family and just loners. Don't know what Steve Jobs had to do with this movie or why it was dedicated to him, but never the less I am curious. Last thing to say is that it is a very, a very good movie.
B0068LYEHA|4.0|this is a mostly fun read and I loved the stories of the author's life. She does go sideways on tangents about feminism but a good thinking book
B008UTV6S8|2.0|Great band but Paul is really starting to show his age. When harmonizing with others....primarily Garfunkel.....he seems to raise his effort. He deserves to have fun...earned it....but this will likely be my last solo purchase.
033041965X|1.0|Enjoyed the book. Like all Baldacci's books it's a fast entertaining read. But, this book came without the first 16 pages.
B009A9BF5G|5.0|Coldplay is simply at their very best. Saw this concert in 2012 and their performance was nothing short of...spectacular! In the past I have always liked some songs but seeing them live converted me into a lifelong fan....a must for your collection...only negative is the lack of grace-notes on the CD.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|I went into this movie expecting more great storytelling from Spielberg. Alas, this one doesn't meet the lofty standards set by most of his other films.<br /><br />Right off, the film delves into syrupy storytelling. The characters don't feel like real people; they feel tacked-on and caricatured.<br /><br />There are also has some narrative problems with the overall plot. Once Joey (the horse) leaves the farm, it is apparent that the focus of the story is him.<br />However, as new characters are introduced, the focus shifts away from Joey and onto them. Then, as soon as those characters are left or killed off, the focus shifts back to Joey.<br />The pacing is very poor because of this, and the message that Spielberg is trying to convey is quite muddled.<br /><br />Yet another issue is the banal and maudlin dialogue. At times it genuinely felt as if I was watching a Hallmark film.<br />Possibly the most egregious example of the poor dialogue is when the grandfather is speaking to his granddaughter about carrier pigeons.<br />The scene tries so very hard to be poignant and inspiring, but unfortunately, it comes across as saccharine and schmaltzy.<br /><br />I won't say the film is horrible, as it does still have some moments of inspiration. But regrettably, these moments are few and far between.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wish I had 10 of those, or more, for the winter months.  Too short!  Loved it, as usual, like all of his books.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very interesting how the story line progressed to the ending.  I was actually very happy with the ending and looking forward to the prequel,
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a good relaxing watch for adults. Do not think it is not for small children, a little scary. Loved the true meaning of this movie. Love changes everyone.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second book of the trilogy!<br />The best of the trilogy!<br />Love love love!!!<br />I recommend for sure!!!<br />Read it!
B000000OAC|5.0|I see about 130 reviews here, so I'll keep this brief and to the point: This is one of my favourite Queen albums and I have not only this remaster but the 2011 deluxe 2 CD edition as well. Both are excellent reissues and are easily recommended by me, but my reason for this review is to let buyers know that this CD has a bonus track which is NOT on the 2011 deluxe set, that song being the awesome sounding remix of \\"We Will Rock You\\". I think this track is outstanding and worth the cost of this disc by itself, although many people apparently feel otherwise. So, if you're like me and want this extra track, I recommend picking up a copy  as newer releases may ultimately put this one out of print.<br /><br />Hope this has been of some help to you.<br /><br />Enjoy & God bless :-)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love the show - keeps getting better each episode! Barely can wait for the next episode to come out on Amazon!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I really enjoy playing the game. I have found it very entertaining and habit forming! I can understand why it is such a popular game. Good appt.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|The biggest negative, and what kept me from really liking this was the production. Even on my high end sound systems I was very disappointed in the highs and lows. Nothing stood out. It all seemed to be monotone'ish. This could have been produced much better and should have been.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Travis and Abby's story was amazing ! After reading some reviews I was worried that they wouldn't end up the way they did ! Excellent can't wait to read the next one !
B000V86OKG|5.0|great tv show. love Dexter.. Arrived as ordered. Thanks. I will  be ordering the next season soon. I love you..
1400049628|5.0|i get this feeling that sometimes IM the book and secretly trapped in the pages is my life and in an alternate universe the book is really reading me 8 
B000A6CLL0|5.0|Sure, there are other Trek series I prefer, but I've grown to love this one and I have watched the complete series several times. Great cast, great character development.
0553384775|5.0|I love this book and hope a third book is written.  In addition to real accounts(I fact checked as I read) of drugs, yach sinking, prostituion and midget tossing it had tons of humor throughout.
0802473156|5.0|This book is very insightful, and could be useful to many relationships.  It's likely that many will already know much of what is in this book, but a refresher is never a bad idea.
0316067598|5.0|This book is a must read!! This one of the few eye witness accounts of the most horrible parts of battle that civilian will never see and most will never hear. If not for Marcus Luttrell this would have been sweep under the rug by the pentagon!! As a United State Marine I know first hand that horrible things that are done to Military combat personal are keep quit but the things that we do are spread out all over the news for the world to see! Thank you Marcus Luttrell for your service. Your are a true HERO!!!
B0056FMNYA|5.0|I put many miles on uneven ground into my first use of the B-Grip belt and it passed muster with ease. It was so nice to not have my camera swinging back and forth while walking and having both hands free to handle other tasks. Three days of steep stairs and hilly terrain at the new Formula 1 track in Austin Tx and not a single complaint. If you are a photographer and do alot of walking then this belt strap is for you.
0061537969|5.0|This was a great book from start to finish.  I did not want to put it down.  It was told from the perspective of the dog and I found that totally entertaining.  A must read for any pet lover.
B0091REZMW|4.0|For a free game. this is quite good hidden object game. IF it really was free. it would be great. Unfortunately, the need to buy tokens (coins or jewels) to banish various creatures that appear randomly. Nonetheless you can get through without much extra cost. You just can't do as much as you could if you paid more. A classic case of &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot;
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I bought this case because I have 2 small children who love to play on my phone and are not as cautious with it as I. I did the water proof test as specified and it worked great! My only complaint is that when it was dropped from a child's height, the back of my phone itself cracked to pieces!! Especially around my flash and now i am no longer able yo take night pictures without having a fog over the photo. The case is in perfect condition, not a scratch,  but as far as shock proof goes I'm giving it a zero.
B00992CF6W|5.0|while it doesn't have all of the features from the newer updates for Minecraft-PC, it is still extraordinarily epic.<br />The controls are super easy, just an arrow key pad onscreen and you just tap where you want to put a block, or hold down on a block you want to destroy. the crafting system took a bit to get used to because its a list that you choose from. Luckily it tells you exactly what items and how many you need to craft what you want.<br />It works AMAZING on my kindle fire. :D<br />100 stars/ 10
B009OYSFDM|5.0|By far, Arrow is one of the best new shows in recent years. It pulled me in from the first episode, and hasn't disappointed yet. My only complaint is by Episode 6-7, Oliver's constant disappearing act seems to be under-explained. Viewers may quickly get tired of this, as we deserve to see some sort of career path explained to justify his secrets and mysterious actions. Blaming it on his 5 yrs away at sea is only going to last so long before it seems unbelievable. As far as the acting talent, Steven Amell shows a depth of emotion rare to many male actors these days. Even though he could skate by on looks alone, he delivers each and every time, making me feel his pain, his loneliness, and his passion for the mission. Overall, Arrow is at the top of my Must Watch List this year.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|i've seen this movie before and wanted to buy it for a family member, everyone that i know that's seen it loved it.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Didn't get to see it in theaters but still damn good. Was worth the wait.
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|MOVIE WAS STUPID . REASON I WATCHED IT WAS I THOUGHT IT WAS A TIM BURTON MOVIE . KNEW RIGHT FROM THE START IT WASN'T . DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Highly recommended movie. The 3D takes it over the top. A must see movie for everyone in the family. Go get it!!
0316223239|5.0|This book was from the prospective of a child and it was spot on. The situation that they(child and mother) lived through was extrordinary and it left you wondering how you would have handled it.
B004I744AS|5.0|Easy to understand definitions, always has the words I need, and I love the &quot;voice&quot; feature that allows you to here the word
B005WUHAX8|1.0|It is very hard to hear with the case on.  I can't use it any longer, definitely would not recommend
0240815807|2.0|Didn't give it one because it is vital information. But this could have been condensed down to 80 pages. So wordy. He writes about stuff that doesn't matter for 2 pages and then gets back to the point later. There are much better books on the market that are less convoluted. Good information. But disappointed in writing style. Makes it too complex and not straightforward - vital ingredients for an instruction manual such as this.
0307730697|5.0|I have never read a book that brought tears to my eyes as this one did. This young man fought all the problems of his younger years, recognized them and sought to defeat them through sheer determination of will and a loving family he truly cherished, never complaining and accepting all disappointments as a mere challenge. The author presents the facts of the book in such a way that makes you feel you personally knew this young warrior and would be proud to be his parent.<br />I very seldom write reviews for a book, especially a book that will bring tears. This book is the one exception and should be read by every American who has faith and compassion for our warriors who serve to protect us and keep us from harm. Seal team 6 operator Adam Brown was such a man and his courage, love of God, Country and family will always be remembered.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Just got my Kindle Fire and downloaded the game for free.  The game is great, but the pop-up ads are really annoying.  Although there is a selection to delete the ads, it does nothing.  I don't know if it is a problem with the game or with the Kindle Fire, but when I select to delete the ads, the app locks up and I can't do anything.  I even tried to let it run, but after 30 minutes I had to shut down the Kindle completely and restart in order to do anything.
1881273873|5.0|I am very surprised to see people saying that Chapman wrote this book for dating people. Most of the examples are not about that. Chapman tells the reader to begin with their relationship with their parents. He also talks about relationships with coworkers, and even strangers. I bought this book after having read the one for couples. I am married. I bought the book because I was looking for appropriate ways to give and receive love with people who are not my spouse. I found it great. Chapman encourages us to become fluent in all the \\"languages\\" and to be aware of others needs. Sounds like St. Paul to me, \\"Be all things to all men\\". I tended to whine a bit and think of myself when I read the couple's book, thinking more about what he's not doing than what I might do. But this book is very clear that when we give, we will receive and it gives practical ways to do this. I am recommending it to all my friends.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|I am a classic movie collector.  As a long time Christian, these are the kind of movies I like best.  I am not a movie critic, so I can't say anything about the acting, directing etc.  I just know that the color was very good and I loved the actors and actresses in the movie.  The movie has been on my favorites list for a long time.  It was well packaged and arrived soon after I ordered it.  I am very happpy with the service I get from Amazon.com
B00280LYIC|5.0|I loved the book so much! I'm10 & am looking ford to the 2 book.  :)<br />Hope this is helpful!  :)
B003L77GH4|5.0|If you are a fan of the series you will really enjoy Season Two.  The packaging is nice and it arrived from Amazon in a very timely manner.  Watching this at home is just like watching it on TV.  Love it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|it is fun but don't like how much effort it takes to get the bucks.  I love the G5 games though for sure.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Christmas is my favorite holiday.  While I know there is no Santa, this doesn't keep me from really enjoying the great Christmas films that we have available.  This is one of the best.  I have the newer version also, but still prefer this one.  It is a classic and each year I try to watch it at least twice.  It arrived from Amazon in a very timely manner and in very secure packages.  Thanks again, Amazon for helping me add a classic to my collection.
034580404X|5.0|I love this story. It's more that a BDSM story, it's a love story. I would recommend it to men and women.
B008TTPQXA|3.0|Overall I was disappointed with this book as was expecting more from the author's experience of the after-life. I wondered why he described the different levels of heaven as An Earthworm's Eyeview, The Spinning Melody andThe Gateway. I also did not understand why he called God Om. I felt that the book was &#34;padded&#34; although I understood that Eben Alexander wanted to show that he was a highly educated doctor and that it was important to give detail from a medical aspect.<br />It was interesting to read how he subconsciously he felt unloved and how deeply that pain went when he learnt that his birth parents had married and gone on to have other children after giving him up for adoption.<br />The  important messages I received from the book were 1) That God loves us greatly and unconditionally, 2) There is life after death.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Have to admit, I expected it to be more interesting.  I kept reading just to see where she was going, I guess I hoped it would get better.  It didn't.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Great CD, on par with Green Day's earlier work and doesn't feel cheap, stretched or commercialized. 24 years and Green Day still has music left to make, amazing.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I'm going to recommend this book for Book Club next year.  I did recommend it this year, but the others felt it was too new for everyone else to get a copy in time.
B00936A0RU|5.0|EXCELLENT MOVIE From start to the end, action pack do not move an inch or you will miss something I promise,.
1452110581|5.0|my friends and I volunteer in animal rescue and could not stop laughing when I shared.  Awesome book...only someone with kitty experience could write this..oh, that's right-written by cats.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|The book follows the efforts of a marooned astronaut on Mars.and how he overcomes so many obstacles with ingenious solutions. Its not a book that will get your adrenalin up but a truly fascinating read. You'll feel elated as he finds solutions to hopeless problems but then let down with a bang as another problem surfaces. I really loved it.
B004XC5LP0|5.0|The acting is great and the plot is great. It is a good action disaster movie. I highly recommend seein it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|A compelling read, well written.  However, I did not like either of the main characters.  I like to read books where I like the characters.  Very unsatisfied with the ending.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|Loved it! I grew up watching the TV series, beginning when Steven Hill played the head of the IMF team, Mr. Briggs. This last installment of the movie series is well worth the money spent. Lots of action, great location shots, and enough of a sense of humour to keep you laughing, but not at the wrong time. Tom Cruise may annoy you in real life sometimes, but not in this movie. Enjoy!
B007M45PMU|5.0|This is one amazing album.  I have not heard any of the other albums yet but am sure to buy!  This music can just hang in the background or rock your living room!  Love the instruments used because they are unique.  A few of the tracks sound &#34;live&#34; although I think it was made to sound this way but this really has me itching to go see this band as soon as possible!  Love it, just afraid I am going to &#34;play it out&#34; quickly because I am not listening to anything else!!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I mainly use my XBOX 360 for exercise and on 3 different games (EA Sports Active 2, UFC Ultimate Trainer and Nike+ Kinect) it didn't work properly.  I tried every trick outlined in hundreds of reviews to no avail.  It either cuts off the bottom of my body or it leaves me stuck in a crouching or squat position.  Maybe it works on conventional games but it's garbage for me.  I wish I could have my $10 back.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Riveting story, engaging characters.Not for the faint hearted, however, as the scenes in prisons and in war zones are very graphic. The author tells it like it is (or was). Made me want to visit Bombay -- his love for the city was infectious
1419705849|4.0|My son loves this series but he's an advanced reader and read the entire novel in about two hours! He must have liked it a lot to read it without stopping.
0399536108|5.0|This book was in excellent condition (better than described) and is a terrific read to anyone looking to purchase - don't think, just click!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Want something a little sassy? This movie gives sassiness and a heartwarming tale of a little shoe factory that turns to a drag queen and they thrive together.
B0002S947K|5.0|Ray LaMontagne is such an incredible folk artist - this album speaks milestones for Ray, not a song on this album that does not touch my heart.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I love the movie. I watch it over and over angain<br />I am very pleased with the condition in which it arrived.<br />It was received on time.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album will forever be a classic in the 2000's genre. Mumford and Sons take charge with their first big hit album and waste no time showing the world just how amazing they are.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is hilarious! It's a must see for the holiday season. Buy it, you won't be sorry. It's a new classic.
1401907725|5.0|I purchased and a friend loved them so much she ordered her own the same day! A wonderful gift to give or receive.
0316227706|5.0|this is a great book, love the pictures...has a lot of labs and retrievers in it. I could look at it for hours and still laugh
6305428042|5.0|My daughters absolute favorite Halloween movie!  I was thrilled to find at a great price and surprise her with it.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|A page turner! Great follow up to first book. I actually like this book the most and got to know the characters a little better.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|After watching it myself, I ordered one for my older sister as a gift.  I think she will enjoy it also.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I was not impressed with the previews, and all the associated toys bugged me, but I was thoroughly charmed by Despicable Me. It turned out to be laugh-out-loud funny, sweet without saccharine, with a surprise ending as the protagonist/villain works to earn the respect of his mother. At the urging of my 15-year-old son, we showed it last weekend to my 25-year-old daughter (a fan of off-beat movies such as Big Fish and Little Miss Sunshine as well as Jane Austen movies) and she loved it, too.
B000WBZ5M0|4.0|Love the Ocean's movies.  Only reason for the four stars is because I think the first film is better.  Amazing cast brought together for an unforgettable heist.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love it! Easy to use. Set it and forget about it! I like the preprogrammed melodies and I love making my own new favorotes!
B008M87GJK|5.0|This is a good source of un-filtered world news. I use it daily to get the truth about what is happening in the world.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book. It was a quick read, and very well written.  Nicholas Sparks did a great job on this one.
B0086700CM|2.0|I loved temple run played it before, at first I was hooked.then it got very lacy and choppy and kept crashing and having to reload.I have to say I was dissapointed plz fix
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Nice App.  Lets me scan WLANs in the area, assess their signal strength, security type, and determine what channel's might be best for any WLAN I happen to be working with.  I think this is going to be a go-to app for me from now one.
0345803485|1.0|I'm sorry, but that was by far the worst literature ever printed. I'm so horrified that she's so celebrated for this steaming pile of nonsense. Grammatical errors, no actual research into the subject matter, intense repetition...<br /><br />If she were 14, it would be one thing... I would expect a 14 year old to be this sophomoric. She's not 14 though, she's a grown woman, and this book is a steaming pile of garbage.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The concept of the book was interesting. I have an interest in reading the stories of persons that have had near death experiences. I find the subject fascinating. I thought that Dr. Alexander gave a very convincing description of the awesome experiences while he was in a coma for a week. Although his stories were convincing and also shared some commonalities with other stories that I've read, I did not feel that he actually proved the existence of heaven. What I mean is that Dr. Alexander's treatise did not in my mind meet the standards of scientific inquiry. For example, although he made reference toward trying deep meditation as a means of having similar experiences, he did not cite any literature that would validate that as a safe and reliable means of experiencing the after life. Overall, however, I found the book to be quite enjoyable reading.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|The Expendables 2  It was an action movie that kept your attention - no dead spots. Good cast of characters.
B008Y1YJZY|5.0|Face it; anything with Hugh Laurie has to be great. Seriously, it is a very good Christmas movie; it will be a classic!
B003E88TKS|5.0|I travel alot, not quite as much as George Clooney's character, but a lot.  I can really relate to a lot of what goes on during his traveling adventures, and can definitely relate to his angst over time lost with family while seeking that ultimate career, and being outstanding in his field!!  Sam Elliott's appearance at the end was a unique touch, and I laughed so hard, I woke up the passenger next to me (I rented this for my Kindle Fire for a 6 hour flight out west)!!!
B006YXTRHY|1.0|This is by far the worst in the saga.  The story was not advanced in the least.  There was no reason to make this into another movie except to waste time before the final movie.  The wolves were poorly rendered and look fake (by today's standards).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I always have trouble finishing books that I've started. I decided to read this because my wife loved it and the boys in my middle school Sunday School class had read it many times. I couldn't put it down! I read this book in 3 nights even though I had to work each day after that. I am really looking forward to the 2nd book and I may even start reading it tonight.
B009YU62H2|5.0|I have been a soundgarden fan for a very long time. This album ROCKS!  If you liked the old soundgarden you will LOVE this album!  If you have no idea who soundgarden is this is STILL an awesome album!
044042335X|5.0|Child has created one of the best character series I have ever read. Kind of reminds me of the old Mike Hammer/ Mickey Spilane series from years ago.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|I enjoyed the game, but after a while it kept freezing up on me and eventually wouldn't load any longer. I got it free so i wasn't upset. I would not pay for this app
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Very engaging. Glad I read it.  This is the first in a series that I am looking forward to.
B0086700CM|5.0|its ok but I think there needs to be more action.To easy.so if u guys make a new temple run make it harder. thxs
B004IK8PLE|5.0|Mr Simon tells the history of cryptography in a away every one will understand and maybe love!<br /><br />I started read this book by recommendation of a friend who is &#34;crypto nerd&#34;. At the second chapter I was recommending the book to all my nerd and geek friends... by the end I gave my copy to my brother and bought a kindle version. Very good book! I loved it.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|I LOVE This App It's. Awesome You Should Totally Buy It Plus It's. Free, So You Have Nothing To Loose .
B00A4A2WH0|5.0|I was glad the download was edited. also the download sounds crystsl clear. the album cover that displays is also a clear picture
B00395ZYVS|3.0|It was a good book but not fabulous.  A little predictable.  It did make me want to eat Indian food.
B001H1SVO8|4.0|I'm writing a review of the 10th Anniversary Edition Bluray, not the film itself. The film is in my top 10 movies of all time so my rating does not reflect the movie. I watched this Bluray last night on a 65 inch Samung LED and I have to say that it looks really nice. Though most of this film is dark and can be tough to tell that you're actually watching a Bluray at times, you will notice how clear it is when it moves to brighter scenes. It looks most impressive once you get to the house on Paper Street. The cracks in the walls, graininess and overall decrepit look of the house is a pleasure on the eyes. Audio is also top-notch. I watched it with DTS 5.1 and could hear every drop of water, wail, stomp, punch and explosion in glorious surround sound. As far as the extras go, don't expect much difference from the DVD that was released about 10 years back. It features several audio commentaries alongside the movie as well as deleted scenes. For the most part there's nothing new there, which doesn't bother me much because I've always been about the movie itself and not cared too much about 800+ hours of extras. I have a box full of old DVD cases where all of the &#34;extras&#34; DVDs are residing - extra's are just not important to me, but I know they are to some so that's why I'm mentioning it. Bottom line is buy this if you love the movie and don't care about getting AMAZING extras. Every time I watch this movie, I notice something new and this Bluray is by far the best cinematic experience of the film to date. The 4/5 stars I give this more of a &#34;really like it&#34;.

0547884591|4.0|I've followed Tim's blog for a long time and purchased this book off of my appreciation for the time and thought Tim always puts into his projects.  The book did not disappoint.<br /><br />What I like most:  His approach - cooking and all other skills he tackles are broken down clearly.  A lot of times acquiring skill in an unfamiliar area feels like drinknig from a fire house.  Tim gets this and knows that failure occurs because this overwhelming feeling causes most to give up.  The steps are clear and gradually bring you along to acquiring the base knowledge needed in order to branch out and discover on your own, which is the whole point.  I am not a beginner in the kitchen, but there were many tips I took from the pages and it is a great reference for better understanding why items are prepared a certain way and the impact on your time, preparation and flavor.  I have the food stains in my copy of the book to prove it inspired me enough to try some new things out.<br /><br />Organization:  I've read reviews complaining about the organization or lack thereof.  True, the book does jump around, but the introduction is very clear about the layout of the book, it is supposed to be a reference book and not necessarily meant to be read sequentially.  I skipped a number of sections, scanned over others, intently read or re-read other sections and dog eared pages I will definitely return to (sorry Tim).<br /><br />Takeaway:  I learned new skills, was inspired to try some new techniques and plan to revisit a number of areas in the book repeatedly.  Felt it was and is well worth the money as it will continue to get use after making the first run through its pages.

B001DU8T6S|2.0|Singers like Mick Jagger, Roger Daltrey & Robert Plant are all great frontmen, but are all cut from the same cloth, whereas Freddie Mercury was a completely unique talent.<br />Mercury could have made a career as a classical singer or in a pop band, but for some bizarre reason ended up the front man in a slightly proggy rock group.<br />Which is why the music of Queen is utterly unique, with no other band before, or after sounding remotely like them.<br />This unfortunately is not the case with Paul Rodgers, who is an outstanding talent, with Free & that Muddy Waters album, but he's just one of the boys, with his personality being too close to that of May & Taylor.<br />So what you hear is a middle aged, male menopause soft rock album, with songs about not being to old to rock, wanting to settle down & how people are obsessed with being famous (which is a bit rich coming from May & Taylor!).<br /> What may have improved the record, could have been to have Rick Rubin or Nigel Godrich to produce, perhaps pushing the band to up their game a little.<br />So all in all a disappointing side project, rather that the evolution of the Queen brand.
B009LE7AU4|5.0|Well written account of John's years growing up, how he met his bandmates, and what influenced their developing sound and style. It also covers John's personal life and how he's changed as a person over the years. If you're a Duran Duran fan, this book flies by. I only wish it were longer.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I was hooked as soon as I began to read it.  Had part of it figured out before the end, but the end was such a let down!
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|This movie had a great cast, a great plane crash, and good cinematography.  It also had terrible CGI wolves, a terrible recurring poem, and lots and lots of man pain--dead wife, missing the kids, nothing to live for, but stoic, and shared around a campfire after killing a wolf.  Think Hemingway meets Jack London, only without London's excellent prose.  And spoiler alert: after all the stuff these dudes go through?  Every last one of them dies.

B007THA4FI|3.0|I enjoyed this book more than I expected to, given some of the prior reviews.  The book contains multiple intersecting story lines concerning a whole cast of characters.  I almost needed a score card to keep track of how everyone was related.  But I did find I was interested in all the different story lines. And it was a quick read.  My main complaint was that I found the ending unsatisfying.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was so happy to find that I wasn't the only one who failed to see the \\"fabulousness' of this story.  I wondered why it was so popular, was it just the connection to Twilight?  I totally agree with Meymoon, the text was something a teenager would dream up, the characters were too unbelieveable for words.  I gave up after the first 150 pages!  I had no desire to see how this \\"fabulous\\" story would turn out and now I see that I didn't miss a thing.  Glad to hear that I didn't waste my time.

B006WQLH7G|1.0|I cannot speak to the individual features of the avast! Mobile Security app.  I had it installed for less than a day.  On the one hand, the interface does look rather complete and professional; and the functions it seems to provide cover a broad range of activities.  (Though, as many reviewers have commented, the question still remains whether all of this is *necessary* on an Android platform today.)<br /><br />My 1-star rating (and it would have been lower, if I could assign 0 stars) is based entirely on two things.  The first is that it is supposed to be a \\"background\\" app, and not take up any resources.  Yet while it was running, it had the highest CPU percentage (7%) of any other app.<br /><br />Second was the fact that if you even *open* the app once, it will become unstoppable.  You cannot decide to say \\"Yeah, that was good to look at; but I don't think I need it running right now.\\"  I opened it only to investigate the capabilities; then I tried to shut it down.  Closing the app didn't do it (which isn't uncommon).  So I tried the Advanced Task Manager app -- which closes any other of the 280+ apps on my tablet.  But it wouldn't close this app.<br /><br />I tried several other apps, then Googled the problem.  One recommendation was to use the Android Settings app, navigate to the App Management section, and use its \\"force close\\".  When I got there, I saw that there were *six* different services running, not just one.  Each had a \\"force close\\" option, which I selected.  It still didn't go away.  I cleared cache, and ran Advanced Task Manager again, and it *seemed* to be gone.<br /><br />To my surprise, a short time later I saw a Notification on my Notification Bar that \\"avast! is protecting me\\".  Sure enough, it had started up -- along with all of its companion Services!<br /><br />Enough was enough.  I've uninstalled the app completely (though I wouldn't even be surprised to find that it left some \\"remnant\\" behind that is going to RE-install itself somehow!)  I do NOT like apps (even on my PC) that \\"take control\\" of my system to that degree.  I'm still the one who makes the decisions, not any app.  I want apps that respond to my commands.  NO app should be \\"unkillable\\".  Ever.  Not when I'm doing it through internal \\"force closes\\" at the Services level!<br /><br />I've installed the Watchdog app to make sure that avast! (or any other app) will not do this in the future.  If you have any concerns about losing control of your Android system, I would NOT recommend installing the avast!

B009AMANBA|5.0|Steven Spielberg and Tony Kushner made some interesting and difficult choices in Lincoln that I think have succeeded in making a brilliant film about one of the most written about historical figures ever, and certainly the most written about and familiar American historical figure.  And yet despite a billion words written about this man he still somehow remains an enigma with something withheld and unrevealable about the man.  No doubt that is his continuing fascination to us and I have no doubt many more millions of words will be written, again vainly trying to get at the essence of the man.  It is far easier to gaze in wonderous respect at the marble statue in his unmatched Memorial than to try to find the human being within the marble.<br /><br />Spielberg and Kushner have done their best to try to find the man with the inestimable assistance of Daniel Day Lewis' genius.  If they haven't succeeded completely, well they are in good company with a thousand other biographers.  I liked the closeness and intimacy of the film.  I liked the quiet.  I liked the touching, beautiful and subtle small details: Lincoln lying down on the floor next to his sleeping son, the ever present shawl on his shoulders, the often stooped gait, Lincoln's ready reach for the illustrative yet sometimes illusive joke or story told with great good humor, Lincoln holding hands with Stimson as the war news comes in, Lincoln's fondness for and engagement with his young aides and soldiers, his gentle touches and the incredible mastery of his emotions, his rectitude and subtle manipulation of the obstreperous, passionate, often obtuse political allies and foes.<br /><br />Throughout, Day Lewis is masterful in his delivery, conveying the homeliness of the man and yet the incredible strength and the sorrow that was with him every day of his Presidency that brought many of his detractors, especially Seward and others in the \\"team of rivals\\" to come to respect and love him.  He's got not just the look, the voice, the walk and movements of the man down, he has the gentleness, and the innate dignity of the man as well. This is Lincoln at the end of the war and his soul-aching weariness coupled with his steely resolution is evident in every frame.  He's superb.  The rest of the characters in the drama have been cast carefully with wonderful actors who actually often resemble the real men they're playing.  I could single out Tommy Lee Jones, David Straithairn, James Spader etc., but frankly everyone is marvelous in this cast down to every one of the maddening and quarrelsome Congressmen.<br /><br />And I thought Sally Fields was a fine Mary Lincoln.  Their scenes together played very well and conveyed in a few brief lines the struggles, regrets, tragic losses and difficulties that divide and also unite a long married couple who have weathered many travails.  I found it convincing.<br /><br />And finally, I am glad the focus of the film was the struggle to pass the 13th Amendment.  Unless you're a history buff, I imagine this will come as some surprise to many and I found their handling of the politics and personalities at play both fascinating and engaging.  I was absorbed and I imagine others will find revelatory the difficulty of passing this crucial legislation. And why not focus on this often overlooked struggle?  As the film carefully explains, the whole moral purpose of the war, abolition, could have been undone postwar without it.<br /><br />Some may find this narrowing of the events of the film to the last 6 months of Lincoln's life and the struggle to legislate a disappointment.  Not me.  As mentioned, we have had millions of words and many films and documentaries covering the overview of Lincoln's life. I applaud Spielberg and Kushner making an intimate film closeup and intense and, yes, full of dialogue and argument as the framework to illustrate an exceptional man in unimaginably difficult and tragic times, and finding within this closeup a glimpse of the man and his relations with wife, children, and friends and foes.  It is a brilliantly acted and directed illustration of democracy being tested to its limits, ornery and contentious even within the midst of Civil War, and human beings at their most venal and at their most noble.<br /><br />Many insights and much of this history is conveyed in dialogue (Lincoln's admission of his assumption of powers not necessarily granted him and ignoring of the law when he deemed it necessary is a prime example) and a potent line here and there speaks volumes about the war, the law, the Presidency, his marriage, his sorrow, his guile, and his steadfastness.  Nicely done and will promote repeated viewing.<br /><br />As expected from Spielberg, the production values are marvelous.  Well done in all departments.

0375850864|3.0|The injection of the 20,000 pyramid games show at the beginning of the book ,peaked my interest  because  I could see the the contestants playing the game. In other words, I use to watch the game when I was young.  So, I couldn't wait to see if the Miranda's  mother won the money.  However, as the book ended its first act I thought the setting and description became vapid, almost lost in a vacuum.  The story seem to  lose focus, diverging away from the family preparation for the game show.  Finally, the author came back to the motif of the book in the last few chapters, but it seems more as an afterthought.

0618918248|3.0|This review will be written from a certain Chrtistian perspective. However, I will make an effort to be fair minded and objective; which is more than I can say for much of The God Delusion. Richard Dawkins objective in writing this book, as stated at the beginning of the second paragraph on page 28 of the 2008 paper back edtion is,\\"If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down.\\" If that is his goal then this book is an abysmal failure for it had quite the opposite effect on this reviewer; for after reading it I believe more strongly than ever that there is a God. I find it difficult to believe that I would be alone in this reaction.<br /><br />The God Delusion is an engagingly written even frequently entertaining book. Mr. Dawkins is obviously a fine writer and an excellent scientist. He does a wonderful job of stating the various principles of his own field, evolutionary biology, and related areas in terms which are very accessable to the layman and novice. As a result there much to be learned about the thinking behind evolution, some of which is in fact valid and corresponds to some degree with the reality of how life developed and diversified on this earth. It is the conclusion of Richard Dawkins and others that there is no room and no need for God as creator that is in error. Meme's are his artificial constructs which which function as the sociological counterpart to gene's in biology. He uses them to quantify and catagorize behavior systems in sentient species. He would reduce belief in God to a misfriing of a mechanism originally developed through natural selection for another purpose.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins admits that there are two seemingly insurmountable obstacles to a godless totally naturalistic explantion for the development of the universe and the life therein which are: the development of life from lifelessness and the origins of consciousness and intelligence. It has been said that DNA the building block of all life is a complex chemical language or code with its corresponding order and syntax which are far from random. In the famous Miller experiment of the 50's and its more recent variations amino acids were created under laboratory conditions which are components of the proteins which make up DNA; but there have been no true life generating results. Continuing the language analogy the results of these experiments have been jibberish. If scientists ever do succeed in \\"creating life\\" it will result from the intelligence of minds somehow reordering the amino acids into their proper sequence maybe with the aid of computers. This would strongly suggest the need for a super intelligence ie God to have developed life in the first place.<br /><br />I'm not sure what Richard Dawkins belief's are that he is trying to explain in his attempt to dismantle Thomas Aquinas famous proofs for the existence of God. It is one of the most basic and unavoidable scientific truths that every effect  has a cause and the universe is an immensely large effect which demands an immensely powerful cause. There are two choices; either an infinite regress an endless chain of cause and effect which had no beginning and has no end or something or someone where the \\"buck stops.\\" It seems he would he prefer an infinite regress to the idea of God as the terminator to the regress, the uncaused source of everything; that if a terminator is even a valid concept it is something mindless.<br /><br />Mr. Dawkins mind seems so closed to the idea of God that he does not consider theology(the study of God) to be a legitimate field of knowledge worthy of an academic degree; he therefore dismisses out of hand any discussion of the possible nature of God as nonsense. His attitude toward the Bible is little better. Although he does consider the King James or Authorized version to be an important literary document and contribution to the english language, to him it is nothing more than a  collectionof myths or stories based in fabricated or extremely flawed history ie it is almost completely lacking in historicity. There are many books revealing research which give the lie to this position such as  \\" The Case For Christ\\" by Lee Strobel or \\"The Historical Jesus\\" by Gary R. Habermas. Don't accept liberal criticism of scripture at face value without your own research. It seems Mr. Dawkins has done little of his own Biblical research but quotes liberal scholars who make conclusions supporting his overall opinion. In the past such men claimed that the Old Testament people the Hittites never existed; however archeologists later confirmed their existence.<br /><br />Given this attitude toward scripture it is understandable why Richard Dawkins would not make extensive use of it in trying to plead his case for the non-existence of God and why he would make such obvious mistakes concerning what it says, mistakes that Sunday School children would not make. Richard Dawkins tries to create a conflict between the three gospels that mention Christ's Birth or detail events surrounding it. According to Luke, Jesus parents Mary and Joseph were living in Nazareth in Galilee and journeyed to Bethlehem in Judea for the tax census where Jesus was born, later returning to Nazareth. Matthew makes no mention of where they were living before but does state in Chapter two that He was born in Bethlehem. Dawkins argues based on the logical fallacy of what is not said that they were living in Bethlehem all along. Matthew states however that Mary, Joseph and Jesus came to live in Nazareth after the death of Herod, in no way suggesting the parents had never lived there before. In John people in the crowds following Jesus state their belief that Jesus was born in Nazareth; John however makes it clear a few verses later that he believed Jesus to have been born in Bethlehem by stating the fact that was where the prophets said the messiah was to be born. There is no conflict between the gospelson this issue simply a different perspective.<br /><br />Richard Dawkins claims that no one gets their moral values from the Bible. While the Bible is not the only source for such values it does contain important moral teaching such as; love mercy and justice, care for widows and orphans and when harvesting leave behind food for the poor. Jesus taught us to do unto others what you would want them to do to you, to love and pray for for your enemies, and to love your neighbor as yourself. Mr. Dawkins claims that Jesus was a racist and a Jewish exclusivist but the example He gives of who that neighboor might be was a Samaritan, one of the people most despised by the Jews. He also spoke to a Samaritan woman.Many women were among His followers and were the first witnesses to His resurrection. In a society where women were considered of little value Jesus elevated them to a position of priveledge. The many detestable acts recorded in the Bible are not there because it approves of them but to show what happens when people turn from God doing whatever \\"is right in their own eyes.\\"<br /><br />Richard Dawkins determined belief that God does not exist boils down to one thing; ignorant people do evil things in the name of God and  religion therefore religion is evil and there is no God.  He all but dismisses the idea that people who do such things are not following the teachings of Christ or of good religion; from the crusades and inquisitions of centuries past incited by the so-called church, or people today who murder abortion clinic doctors or the \\"American Taliban\\" who would turn the USA into a so called Christian theocracy. The millions of Christians who would not resort to violence he accuses of encouraging those who would when they point to certain evils in our world. He Says that he and any atheists he knows would not kill or destroy for their cause; but by insisting that religion is evil, by his own argument is he not encouraging atheists who do believe in violence. The greatest attrocities of the twentieth century have been committed by atheists such as Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin or Cambodia's Pol Pot.<br /><br />Alister Mcgrath author of \\"The Dawkins Delusion\\" who holds a doctorate in molecular biophysics and is now a leading theologian is well aacquainted with the views of leading scientists, both believers in God and atheists. He states that they do not derive their atheism from their science but bring their atheism to their science. Scientific evidence demands neither a belief in the existence or non-existence of God. The apparent division between science and religion that has existed for centuries is the product of closed minded indivduals on both sides who refuse to ask the right questions or accept the answers. The truth is of the people who will read \\"The God Deludion\\" most of those who want to believe in God will continue to do so, probably more strongly than ever, and most of those who want to believe there is no God will become atheists. Maybe Richard Dawkins could create meme's to explain the behavior of each.

B009GEBBNQ|3.0|This  is the kind of movie you need to see 2 times and if you not seen the others like The Hulk, Iron man, et al  then you will get lost.  As stated it is very fast so don't blink you will miss  the action over all it was good but might have been better if they had some more bad guys and or good guys like Spider Man or Fan 4, Who knows this may work into a sequel time will tell.  I give it 3 stars and would have gone to 4 except of it fast pace and needed to slow down once again awhile.

B007TKBD4G|5.0|There seems to be a lot of mixed reviews about this album. I for one love it and think that everyone should at least give it a chance. Do i think that Up From Below is a better album? Yes i do. But do I still love this album? Yes. Yes i do. After Up From Below was released this band did 2 solid years of touring and writing and ended up with over 30 songs. They decided to break up these songs into multiple albums and these are the songs they decided to record for Here. It was meant to be a mellow easy listening summer time album and that is exactly what it is. It is so zen and relaxing and completely different from their first album which I thought was actually a pleasant surprise. Give this album a chance, but don't view it as a follow up to Up From Below or as a summary of this band. Just view it as a tiny chapter that makes up the incredible story that is Edward Sharpe & The Magnetic Zeros.
0606262229|4.0|Maggie Stiefvater's tales of winter werewolves have always been far more striking and poetic than any other werewolf books I can think of. And she brings the story of Grace and Sam to a close in \\"Forever,\\" a hauntingly bittersweet, sumptuously-written coming-of-age tale with a somewhat flawed finale -- it's a bit too rushed and pat, but otherwise quite satisfying.<br /><br />Spring has returned Grace to her human form, but she's still unstable -- she keeps turning back into a wolf and running into the woods. Sam has spent the whole winter waiting for her, despite the people of Mercy Falls thinking he's a budding serial killer. And Cole is hotly pursuing a cure for lycanthropy, using himself as a guinea pig.<br /><br />However, Sam and Grace's idyllic reunion is ruined by another death -- another girl is found savaged by a wolf (pretty obviously Shelby). Isabel's father arranges for the wolves to be exterminated (with HELICOPTERS), leaving the teens only a few days to lead the wolves to safety. Otherwise, Grace may be among the dead.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater is one of the rare young-adult authors who has lyrical, hauntingly lovely writing. Fragmented thoughts arrange themselves into minimalist poems, and mundane situations take on the delicate crystalline quality of a romantic dream (\\"it was just me, broken into pieces, slivered like glass, made into something new\\").<br /><br />\\"Forever\\" centers on three important subplots -- the need to save the wolf pack from Isabel's revenge-obsessed father, the quest for a lycanthropy cure (especially for Cole), and the teenagers shedding their childhood problems as they prepare to set out into adulthood. The story drifts along between these three subplots, with some bloody, tightly-paced action scenes (like the grand finale) woven in.<br /><br />And her characters are just as brilliant as her writing -- four troubled teenagers, who are breaking away from their pasts and their weird parents. Grace and Sam settle into an idyllic little world of their own, but are haunted by the hostility towards Sam and Grace's feelings about her parents. And Stiefvater spends a lot of time focusing on Cole and Isabel's tumultuous relationship, as Cole goes all brilliant mad scientist.<br /><br />One problem: the ending is rushed. Isabel, Cole and Grace take dramatic actions that seem like they should have massive consequences... but they don't. At all. Shouldn't Isabel's dad be having a rage-induced stroke or something?<br /><br />The payoff feels rushed and a little incomplete, but otherwise \\"Forever\\" is a striking, romantic little finale for Stiefvater's brilliant trilogy. This is everything \\"Twilight\\" failed to be.unted by the hostility towards Sam and Grace's feelings about her parents. And Stiefvater spends a lot of time focusing on Cole and Isabel's tumultuous relationship, as Cole goes all brilliant mad scientist.    One problem: the ending is rushed.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best! Could not put the book down and dont want it to come to an end. My kind of story!
0062220837|3.0|I listened to this book after watching the movie [[ASIN:B001AQR3IU Stardust [Blu-ray]]] many times, loving it more with every viewing, so my opinions of the original story may be in the minority.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The audio book couldn't have possibly been read by anyone better than the author - he was absolutely perfect and listening to him was a delight.<br /><br />Cons:<br />It wasn't the movie.<br /><br />The movie has a much better overall story, infinitely better and more interesting characters, a far, far better ending that doesn't leave one feeling vaguely depressed and a lead character who has a very pleasant and less tongue-twisting name than his counterpart in the book; otherwise the book is fine.
B0065CCT6U|5.0|A selection of my favorites spanning Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden, and Audioslave, as well as his own solo work. Great accoustic renditions, unlike some vocalists, Chris just seems to get better with age.
B000GWE44U|2.0|It has been many years since I first saw The Shining, and we decided to rent it the other night to watch it again. I had forgotten what an incredibly slow, boring movie this is. Maybe we've just gotten used to faster-paced, \\"jump scare\\" horror movies, but everything in The Shining seems to be moving through thickly congealed Jell-O. Just when it starts to pick up, you're cut away to some boring scene, like having to watch the cook go through all the steps of being on the plane, chatting with his friend, renting a snow cat, etc. Maybe it was supposed to build suspense, but by the end of the movie, two out of four of our party watching were sound asleep. The little boy screeching \\"red rum\\" made us burst out laughing. If it wasn't for the constantly intruding, over-the-top soundtrack, you wouldn't even know how to feel about what's going on. Fortunately, we have a strident orchestra to tell us to \\"Be scared here!\\" or \\"This is supposed to be odd!\\" Jack Nicholson's performance is still really good, and I can appreciate the cinematography as the camera looks down long, supposedly ominous hallways, and I also appreciate that The Shining broke ground for horror movies yet to come. Worth watching for the cultural references, if nothing else.

The box set includes the 3 films on blu-ray, 2 bonus discs (worth hours of extras), and a booklet for a price that is unbeatable! The director, Christopher Nolan, has reinvented the caped crusader, with actors/actresses that give stellar performances. These movies will inspire you to fight the evil in the world logically in order to preserve the love for a community of people.

1439152802|5.0|To be sixteen, to witness a murder, and to keep it a secret your entire life?  When would Laurel find out the \\"real\\" reason for the murder.  After fifty years, she needed to ask, but could she really find the answer? She had to.  Time was running out.<br /><br />Set in England and moving from the 1930's to 2011, you will follow Laurel as she continues to keep this secret and attempts to find out why her mother stabbed a visitor on her brother's birthday.  Did the baby see or remember anything?  Could that be possible? What if he did remember?  Laurel, her father, and her mother were the only ones that were supposed to know, but were they?<br /><br />The storyline is intriguing and the descriptions are amazing as you go back and forth in time to see what made Laurel's mother life was like as a  child and also as a young adult and what life was like for Laurel, her sisters, and her brother as they grew up on a quaint farm in a loving family.  Dorothy, Laurel's mother, lead a very significant life and had interesting people in her life that shaped her and her decisions.<br /><br />The book seamlessly moves between time periods giving creative details of each era in the characters' lives and has you wanting to know more.  An amazing storyline that keeps you guessing about the real reason for the murder and one that makes you want to be a part of the story in order to be part of the life the characters lead in each decade of their lives.<br /><br />Finding out about her mother's motives and life before she was married was a goal Laurel was determined to solve before her mother died, and her mother is the only one who could give the answers to many questions, but could their dying mother tell all?  Once clues about Dorothy's past begin to surface, you will be as anxious as Laurel was to find out other secrets her mother kept to herself all her life and secrets that caused her mother to commit murder.<br /><br />This book was marvelous and captivating as all of Kate Morton's books, and the ending is absolutely SUPERB.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the walk through Laurel's life and the flashbacks to her mother's life.  Don't miss this book or any book Kate Morton has written...you will be taken away with her exceptional writing and fantastic storytelling skills as she weaves lives and situations together into incredible books.  5/5<br /><br />This book was given to me free of charge by the publisher in return for an honest review.'s books, and the ending is absolutely SUPERB.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the walk through Laurel's life and the flashbacks to her mother's life.

B0091LS07E|3.0|I am a huge Alicia Keys fan. If her music is great I will continue to purchase it regardless of what goes on in her personal life. The first time I listened to the album I was REALLY disappointed. My first disappointment came from the Girls on Fire Song. I was upset that she has the Nicki Minaj version on the album. I feel Nicki adds nothing to the song and, in a way, it cheapens it. Upon a first listen I didn't feel any of the songs were that great. The second time I listened to it I felt it really picked up around \\"Not Even the King\\" that was the first time I felt goosebumps from this album. \\"One Thing\\" is also a bit of a highlight from the album. I expected no less from Frank Ocean. This is an album that you must listen to with your heart. I do feel it is lacking about 2 or 3 showstopping songs. Also, if she would have put the \\"Girls on Fire\\" song without Nicki Minaj it would have flowed much better. I feel that sometimes artists feel they need to add a popular rapper to an album in order to get a larger audience. However Miss Keys doesn't need to do that. She is enough by herself.  My favorite album from A Keys is \\"As I Am\\" followed by \\"Diary.\\" The first time I listened to these albums I immediately felt a connection and many of the songs gave me goosebumps on the first listen. But I admit I am no longer disappointed with this album. I could really feel the hard work on this album. Her vocals were much better than the last album. I felt she took the time with the vocals on this album. On the \\"Element of Freedom\\" I felt her vocals were very lazy. I feel this album is another part of Alicia Keys' journey and she should be proud of her hard work.

1400067820|1.0|In the beginning of this book Taleb states that he will, \\"eat his own cooking\\" in the sense that he lives by his own rules. It seems pretty clear from the tone of the text and his immature and vitriolic attitude that he has gone to drinking his own koolaid. As the other reviewers have noted, this is a really disconnected and repetitive book. If there are insights in it, they are not likely to shine through. To give you an idea of some of the absurdity, one need look no further than this gem in the beginning of the book. Taleb says, \\"fifty thousand in extra cash in the bank or, better, under the mattress, is redundancy\\". This coming from someone who is supposed to be a financial expert. Almost everyone knows that money under a mattress loses its value in inflation annually. In addition, fifty thousand in cash is insured by the FDIC. If you are worried about the economy failing, then the cash is just plain worthless anyway! In short, this one is a definite pass!

B005LAIGNC|1.0|One of the worst movies ever produced; so unreal; the black pilots used their modern 2013 Ghetto talk while flying fighter planes in combat; this never happened back then.  The Africans flew to safety whenever the germans showed up; and left the B-17s with no protection.  If you want to see reality; watch Memphis Belle and Twelve O'clock high for a true movie about real flyboys.  This red tails is simply worthless and all BS.
B006LSZECO|5.0|i loved this book. I was not expecting the twists that happened to take place. Usually i don't like mysteries because there seems to be nothing else to the story except the facts. This book is totally different. There is emotion, an enthralling story line and great depth to the characters--a must read!!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|I would and have reccomended this game to everyone. It is very addicting and challenging, yet still beatable by the average person.  I gave this game 5/5 stars because I play it almost every day and it never gets boring and everyone I have shown it to is immediately addicted.
B001BFFTO0|5.0|This is yet another good looking, water proof boot from Timberland.  To summarize, here is what I think:<br />*Disclaimer: I am writing this having just taken the boot out of the box a few minutes ago<br /><br />Pros<br />- The boot looks solidly made, from good material.<br />- Comfortable.  There is a slight cushion effect when I walk.  Doesn't need breaking in.<br />- There are many ugly water/snow proof boots out there.  This is probably as good looking as they get.<br /><br />Cons<br />- The Burnished Brown color is slightly darker than I what I had wanted.  Not a big deal as it's still a nice color but just beware if you are picky.<br />- As many reviewers have said before, buy one size down.  I am normally a size 10 and a 9 fits me perfectly.<br />- They are a little bit too roomy above the toes.  Could be a little more slim (I'm such a New Yorker...)<br /><br />All in all, great boot to wear for the snow/rain.  I had a pair of Timberlands that last me a solid 5 years before I decided that they just got too stinky for me to use.  These will last me a long time, I'm sure.

B009E3EXMU|4.0|For a fan of Led this is a great choice. The tightness of the band minus the original drummer and drugs. They are tight and Plant delivers in the vocal department. I saw them in 69 and now they are grey now but still rock the house. The DVD part of this shows the nice interaction with the band. You won't be disapointed.

1400049628|5.0|I loved this book, it was very entertaining and a very fun read. I leave this out on my end table and it always gets picked up when people come over and every loves it.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|First, I will not compare the movie to the book.  Both have their own pros and cons, good and bad points, and while are close have different themes and come at those themes from different directions.<br />V the movie is about a terrorist who demands that the people of England make sure a totalitarian government is held accountable for its actions.  He is a terrorist trying to get back at those who harmed him in the past.  And in doing so he may end up freeing the people from a Fascist government. But the movie delivers its message of liberation in a wonderful way that could only be called a form of art.  Hugo Weaving as V is such a good actor he can project his feelings and emotional reactions from BEHIND A MASK.  Natalie Portman, while not as powerful or as skilled as Weaving still holds up her part of the story as Evey.<br />John Hurt as the leader was, for me, a great pick.  He was W. Smith from 1984's Nineteen Eighty-Four so I find it ironic.  Stephen Rea as the police detective is a good balance of smarts and loyalty to the government to make his character just THIS side of reality.  Stephen Fry's character brings a little more reality to the movie yet also adds the one moment of disconnect for me.  The idea that he would get away with broadcasting something on the telly that was not approved by the state-run media does seem a tad unbelievable.<br />Add explosions to the great characters, a solid story, important themes, great fight scenes, and what you get is a Four out of Five film.<br />Overall I enjoyed the movie even while I am also a fan of the book - to me there is no conflict.  Fan of the book or not I suggest, strongly, that you give it a try.  Rent it or get it out of the library.  I bought my copy and will very likely watch it a couple of times before my DVD gives out.<br />Just remember, it is Rated R, so not for kiddies.  And at 132 minutes you will want lots of yummy popcorn. Enjoy!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series of short books was a very interesting read. It sucked me in right away and left me wanting more, I really hope the Hugh Howey publishes more of the silo stories.
B009GESJH2|5.0|Tons of great music on this album.  Kid Rock is showing his range by playing everything from blues to rock.  Great fun album and I bet it's a success for him.  It does not have any of his hard rock/rap style of his earlier years - but overall it's a great album.
B003H4RDZQ|2.0|Too bitter and jaded, even for me. The first story, The Santaland Diaries about his time as an elf at Macy's in New York, resonated with 12 years of holiday retail experience. It was also funny. The other stories were just... ugly. Not funny, not entertaining.
B001BFFTO0|1.0|I found this product after days of searching for something that both looked nice and could take the cold Vermont winters. I ordered a size 12 after reading the reviews (I normally wear a size 13). The 12 way far too large, I had to return them and purchase the size 11.5, which is still slightly too big, but work with some wool socks.<br />I received the pair of 11.5s around October 20th. Everything seemed perfect, kept my feet warm, extremely comfortable, and seemed to keep water out.<br />That's where I was wrong. The toe of the boot started to leak earlier today, it appears that the tip of the toe is glued down to the rubber rather than stitched, and this glue is separating. I am literally experiencing deterioration of the product in just over one month of light use.<br />I'm going to try as hard as I can to get these boots immediately replaced or returned, which will be difficult because it's been just over a month.<br />Beware when purchasing these boots, they look good, but don't live up to Timberlands quality reputation at all.
044655667X|4.0|This was my first Michael Connelly book. I don't usually read a series out of order, but my boss lent it to me and assured me that it didn't matter that I hadn't read the first ones. I had seen the movie of Lincoln Lawyer, so I had an idea of all the characters.<br />I really enjoyed The Fifth Witness. Mickey Haller is defending one of his foreclosure clients who has been accused of killing the bank manager in charge of taking her home. I'm surprised I haven't heard news stories about homeowners getting violent yet. The very timely topic of the book certainly helped. Like any legal thriller, the case and the plot both have many twists and turns, but what set's Connelly's book apart is the characters. They are real and believable. They have complicated lives and relationships, and many layers and motivations.<br />I look forward to reading more of Connely's work and getting to know the characters better.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read every Mitch Rapp book at least twice. I enjoyed this one very much. It was nice to have a more or less straight forward plot that was a quick read. Just wish it had lasted longer.
0307744434|5.0|A lovely imaginative and unique story. A circus open only between dusk and dawn becomes the battlefield for a competition of magical methods. The consequences for the two competitors and the others involved in the circus are intricate and unexpected. This is one of the more creative books i have ever read.  Morgenstern's gift for description is stunning. She makes it easy to see the stunning things she writes about.<br /><br />Pay attention to the dates at the beginning of the chapters, as it is not chronological. Highly recommended.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|My mom was enchanted with this miniseries a few months before I was.  I didn't believe her when she said I'd like it better than Pride and Prejudice.  I was wrong.  Margaret Hale and John Thornton are a duo for the ages.  From different worlds, they both try to adapt to the changing world and views around them.  It is about being true to your self and true to your heart, and damn what anyone else might think. It is about listening to other people, and finding ways to come together for mutual support and survival. And if you like the miniseries, read the book.

B008JFUPK8|5.0|MAN OF STEEL defines comic book movie. The heart-stopping movie instantly pulls you in for the word GO. The amazing effects are breathtaking, the acting is unreal. The storyline is what everyone comic book fan wants. Hands down, the best movie of 2013. I loved the Zod/Superman fight scene. Wow! Finally, some punches were thrown.

B009MF5BXK|4.0|If you saw THE EXPENDABLES then you have a clue as to what to expect from any sequel. Lots of explosions, plenty of gunplay and hand to hand combat from a group of mercenaries who also tend to have a moral backbone. The first film delivered tons of action to the point that I consider it one of the best action films ever made. It was popular enough that a sequel had to follow. So how does THE EXPENDABLES 2 stack up?<br /><br />The opening sequence offers up the action quota quite well and we get to see the team in action. We also meet a new member, a sniper by the name of Bill (Liam Hemsworth). Each member is given enough screen time to earn them their paycheck and before the sequence ends, team member Yin (Jet Li) parachutes out of their plane never to return for the rest of the film.<br /><br />When they return home ready for some R & R, Barney (Sylvester Stallone) is contacted by Church (Bruce Willis). Unhappy with the outcome from the first film, he tells Barney he has another mission for the team, an easy one that will square things away between them. Mission in hand and the addition of a CIA operative Church sends along, the group sets out for a small European country to retrieve some codes locked in a safe.<br /><br />The group retrieves the codes and is ready to head out when they're confronted by a problem they weren't warned about. Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme) and his men have the team surrounded and Bill with a gun to his head. The team can do nothing but give in and surrender the codes. Even though they've complied, Vilain kills Bill in front of them before leaving. Of course this sets the revenge ball rolling and Barney will stop at nothing until he gets the codes back and sees Vilain dead.<br /><br />The premise for the film is rather simple but that's never been a problem with either film. It's a core story that surrounds itself with tons of action and special effects. That's what these films are all about. That and half a dozen hand to hand combat sequences that would result in work for half the stunt men in the world. These films are action films made for fans and for fun. And the new one delivers, for the most part.<br /><br />This time around though it feels different. For one the surprise has been taken out of the equation. The first film we all wondered what it would be like to see some of the biggest names in action films from the 80s together on the screen at the same time. We got that and this time around we get it in spades. We have the members of the original cast together again and Willis and Schwarzenegger are even allowed to play with the rest this time around. Not only that, but Van Damme and Chuck Norris are tossed in as well. Norris has an especially funny part in the film. And yet it doesn't feel the same.<br /><br />Perhaps it's seeing all of our heroes from the past aging just a bit before our eyes even though every one of them still seems fit and perhaps more so than when they were the hottest thing in action films. Maybe it's that the quips and witty one liners we've come to associate with them feel rather old hat here. Yes, they are cute but for me they came up too often. I'm not sure what it is but it made me feel that this film wasn't quite as good as the first one.<br /><br />That being said it's still a great action film. And seeing Willis, Schwarzenegger and Stallone shooting their way through an airport, all of them in the same shot, was amazing. This is not an action film where you'll find yourself wondering how plausible the movie is or if the situations seen could really happen. This movie is a roller coaster ride that takes you up and down, tosses you around and then makes you want to go for another ride. It's a popcorn movie, plain and simple, and one to be enjoyed for just that reason.<br /><br />Word is that a third film is in the works. It will be interesting to see what other action stars of the 80s are brought back for this one. Steve Seagal? Mel Gibson? Perhaps they'll choose a different route and bring in action stars of today with the hopes of making this series of films last longer with a new crew taking on bad guys. No one knows except Stallone who's been behind both films. Let's just hope it continues and only gets better with each film.oose a different route and bring in action stars of today with the hopes of making this series of films last longer with a new crew taking on bad guys.

B001KQZ7I8|5.0|EVERYONE should read this book and then reread every so often. Words cannot describe how wonderful this book is and how helpful it will be in your life. Love it! Love it! Love it!
B009369Z8A|4.0|It's been years since the theme of bootleggers was the subject matter in movies. Back in the 70s there was a rush of movies about this subject ranging from the low budget MOONRUNNERS (the movie later turned into the hit TV series THE DUKES OF HAZARD) to the even lower budgeted MOONSHINERS. Even Burt Reynolds took on the subject in WHITE LIGHTNING. But then it kind of disappeared. That all changed when reality TV took a shine (pun intended) to the topic and the film LAWLESS is a result of that renewed interest.<br /><br />Based loosely on the real life story of the three Bondurant brothers in Franklin County, Virginia, the story focuses on a short period of their lives when bootlegging was their claim to fame and the end result was what was called a war in their home county. Descendants of the real life family have written a book on the subject and that is what the film is based on.<br /><br />The Bondurant brothers were legends in Franklin County. Oldest brother Forrest (Tom Hardy) was said to be indestructible having crossed paths with death on several occasions. Middle brother Howard (Jason Clarke) has perhaps decided to dip into the family recipe too often but remains the muscle of the group. The youngest brother, Jack (Shia LeBouf) is the upstart, trying to think of ways to impress his older brother Forrest and increase the profits of their bootlegging venture. But Forrest is content to sit back and make the money that he does from their product and pay his bribe money to the local sheriff.<br /><br />All that changes when a new prosecutor comes to town. Charlie Rakes (Guy Pearce) is part of a task force that was sent to shut down the stills but who in truth is more interested in taking over the entire county's bootlegging business. When Forrest refuses to comply, Rakes sets out to destroy the Bondurant family in any way possible. The result is a violent and bloody confrontation that leaves Forrest wounded but alive and his brothers ready for revenge. But that is not to happen yet.<br /><br />Jack decides the best way to increase their finances is to begin selling their product to Chicago gangster Floyd Banner (Gary Oldman). With the country dry due to prohibition, Jack can get good money from the mobster in return for supplying the demand the gangsters need for their town. While the brothers may disagree on this item the money does come in handy at the right time.<br /><br />Rakes' men having been behind the attack on Forrest and the brutalization of a waitress and love interest of Forrest (Jessica Chastain) that same night have left a bad taste in the mouths of the brothers. When they blow up their still and murder Jack's best friend in cold blood, a harmless young boy who had no chance of being a problem to Rakes, the brothers can take no more. An eventual showdown between the corrupt lawman and the bootleggers is inevitable. It's bloody but not overly so and the results are surprising.<br /><br />LAWLESS does a great job of capturing the era and area that the film takes place in. The back hills of Virginia look beautiful rather than wasted away and yet the people who live there looks as poor as the times the story takes place in. While bootlegging may have paid the bills for poor farmers who made more money this way it was not the glamorous life that say cocaine dealers have been depicted in more modern stories. These were tough men who did what they had to to feed their families and keep their farms. The work was hard and the rewards merely enough to get by. There was no glitz and glamour here.<br /><br />The acting here is stupendous. Tom Hardy turns in another dynamite performance as a man who uses few words and fewer actions yet carries the threat of violence about him like an aura. His character knows the ways of the world and tries to convey them with little success to his younger brother. LeBouf does a great job as well, depicting a hero worshipping brother who wants to do well by his family yet gets turned downmore often than not. Pearce is equal to these two in depicting a bad guy that even law abiding citizens will find themselves hoping gets his due.<br /><br />The movie doesn't offer a pretty picture of the bootlegging business but it does offer a few new anti-heroes for viewers to root for. You care about this family and the others who faced these problems in the past. It was a violent world that handled things much differently than they are handled today. And that makes for some tremendous storytelling that just might make viewers want to find out more and read about those times.more often than not.

1432794426|5.0|\\"Defending A King\\", written by Dr. Moriarty is a very imformative and insightful book.  My wife and I purchased this book for my son, who at the time was eleven years old.  He is a very big fan of Jackson and we found this book appropriate for him to read as it contains only limited details on the bad publicity that Jackson endured during the latter part of his life. The book focuses on the positive of Jackson. This book is good reading for all ages and I encourage anyone who is looking for postive facts about Michael Jackson to pick up this book and read it. Then when you're though pass it on to someone else to enjoy and share.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Loved this movie. Its not for young people, thus an R rating. It is full of well written hilarious scenes. If u are a lover of Family Guy styled comedy, you will love it.

Mr. Connelly crafts yet another good story line with interesting characters, and a smooth easy to follow who dunit style.  An enjoyable outing for Harry Bosch fans, even though we all know how things will eventually turn out.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I was going to keep mine sealed until I went back and looked at the reviews. I decided I had better take a listen. I broke out Abbey Road. Side 1 played fine. Side 2 (Here Comes the Sun) was absolutely horrible. So much static that it distorted the playback. It is truly unbelievable that this product was shipped. Non-existent quality control. I also experienced, like others, the shipping debacle. Mine came in an over-sized box with some air cushion material but not enough to keep the product from bouncing around during shipment. Luckily, my box was not damaged (light dings on the corners) but I did think to myself at the time \\"you have to be kidding me - who packs this way?\\". Net, I returned mine. I'm going to wait until EMI decides to ship a quality product and then repurchase. Obviously this initial batch is what we vinyl collectors refer to as \\"junk vinyl\\".<br /><br />FOLLOW-UP: Cleaning does not help. I have a professional disc cleaner and cleaned Abbey Road after I listened to the record once through - no improvement. I'm a hard core Beatles collector. I must have over 1,000 collectible Beatles LPs from all over the world (Butchers, the rare Revolver red Capitol \\"bulls eye\\" label, the first pressing of PPM on the Parlophone black and gold label, etc.) and I have never ever experienced anything like the junk in this box set. I can pick up a used Beatles LP on eBay or at the flea market which is 30 - 40 years old and it plays better - much better. I am amazed at what some people will accept for the money they put down. I'm reading about dishing, warping, off center spindle holes, misaligned labels and some reviewers saying \\"but the sound is great\\"... seriously? For $319 everyone of us should have received a pristine set - as in perfect. The box set should have records that rival the Mobile Fidelity pressings from years ago. Instead we were shipped a defective product with the burden on the collector to return, swap out, etc. to get something passable. My suggestion is everyone send this crap back and make EMI do it right.on is everyone send this crap back and make EMI do it right.
B005LLX582|1.0|The best things to come out of this movie:<br />- the laughs I get from reading 1-star reviews about this movie<br />- bonding with my mom after we survived over 2 hours of sheer agony in the movie theater, just the way hostage survivors naturally bond with each other while being held captive together (needless to say, sans Stockholm Syndrome)<br />- my first review on Amazon (motivated by immense dissatisfaction with the film & a need to procrastinate on more important duties)<br /><br />Unless you truly appreciate uber-pretentious, self-important movies, or have dropped a couple sheets of acid, or maybe are under the influence of some very potent magic brownies, please believe all of the horrible reviews and save yourself time and money by skipping \\"The Tree of Life.\\"  I am only reiterating what others have said when I describe this film as self-indulgent and excruciatingly, mind-blowingly boring.  It is the brainchild of what I imagine a young, idealistic, over-ambitious hipster film student would birth after being given $30 million to create their interpretation of THE MEANING OF LIFE, or maybe...THE MOST IMPORTANT FILM EVER MADE.<br /><br />Many of the 5-star reviewers have characterized non-fans as dense, one-dimensional moviegoers who just \\"don't get it\\" because it's not a typical formulaic Hollywood blockbuster. So I wanted to note that although I enjoy all kinds of movies, I especially appreciate well-made independent and artful films. Ones that aren't so literal, forced, and pretentious.<br /><br />My mom and I debated walking out several times throughout the movie, but stayed until the end only because we were hoping it would pick up, or it would have some miraculous final scenes that would've made it all worthwhile.  Nope.

0553801473|1.0|Ice and Fire Books 1 through 3 are brutal, powerful, and engaging if you can look beyond the cruelty and enjoy the \\"game\\".  Book 4 is brutal, ponderous and not very interesting.  Book 5 is brutal, boring, circuitous, and disappointing, and contains nothing but cruelty.  Martin has lost the game, dropped the reins, left the building.<br /><br />Having just slogged through \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", I am no longer interested in the fates of the characters -- those who remain -- and Mr. Martin's world has become an endless, dreary hell of death, destruction and despair.  I will not buy Books 6 through Infinity as I don't want to read about unrelenting hatred, gratuitous violence, baby killing, blood sacrifice, grotesque animal abuse, face eating and/or excrement eating, body fluids, gore, little boys being thrown overboard because \\"their kind\\" shouldn't be allowed to live, and men whose only use for women is to \\"take\\" them forcibly as a prelude to killing them.  Really, how many child rapes can an author cram into a series?  Hey! I enjoy sex scenes as much as the next person, but some of this dreadful stuff is kiddie porn.<br /><br />It seems that Mr. Martin continues to write not to advance the story lines established in Books 1-3, but to vividly describe each and every horrible way a woman, man, child, infant, or beast can be gruesomely hurt and/or die.  And, oh yeah, forget about dying and coming back to a happy afterlife! Indeed, every story development that could be considered even slightly uplifting was left hanging back in Book 3.<br /><br />In some reviews of the early Ice and Fire books, Martin was favorably compared to Tolkien -- undeniably, Martin can write a powerful description. And, each author does have a double-barreled middle name! However, Tolkien developed an intricate, magical world in which loyalty, compassion, honor and even--gasp!--love could endure.  Martin's world is so dark and his characters so despicable that nothing worthy can endure. Tolkienwrote about a quest, Martin writes about --what? -- who cares?<br /><br />Take the advice of many reviewers -- save your grey matter and skip this one.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this complex set of characters set within the confines of an English country village. I am from England and totally related to the local dialogue and social mores of citizens in a small village. I could see perhaps that American readers might have difficulty understanding some of the slang or colloquial language used in the written dialog. I so enjoyed the book that I read it straight through. As usual, J.K. Rowling writes about interesting characters and the complications in their lives, both secret and public. This book is  written about the common human conditions,  and aspirations, and personal secrets,  that are found everywhere in life, whether in a big city or small village.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My grandson, after we took him on a visit to District 12 in North Carolina, insisted that I read the books. Great recommendation from him! Now looking forward to the second movie in the series.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I love this movie. Its different than the &#34;Normal&#34; Disney format. I think it has some great lessons to be learned.
B0060FXBNM|5.0|The movies are great ,but i should warn people this is just the one movie disc of each ONLY. The disc itself still has some extra features and there are some more extras on the BD Live, but i don't think that its the same as the special features 2nd disc. So if you don't mind that for this price its great.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Started the series a month ago and have been flying through the books ever since. Excited to see the camps interact, and finally see annabeth and Percy back together. Mark of Athena here I come:)
B00966TN1Q|5.0|I did not like THE DROP, not the story line, not the characters (except for Harry of course), nor the uncomfortable love interest in spite of the lady's nobility in adversity and THE FIFTH WITNESS was a severe disappointment. I reluctantly thought that this was the end of Connelly for me, but one does not just drop an old friend, and I'm very glad I didn't.<br /><br />The deduction is so intricate and well worked out it is practically a spoiler to describe the book and it has been done by other reviewers anyway, so I won't do that - just say that it is a great read.<br /><br />Harry is the Harry we know, stubborn, committed, unrelenting, with a straight response to an unpleasant supervisor and departmental politics in spite of the threat to his job. He starts the investigation with one clue, a 20 year old shell casing and we follow him as he unearths good leads and bad until he arrives at a solution. There are diversions into his personal life, and so there should be, he's not a cardboard character, which is what we like about him. He even (somewhat shamefacedly) succumbs to being human on a couple of occasions, remembering to be thoughtful and nice to his daughter and partner. One is almost tempted to say \\"sweet\\" - but no, this is Harry after all.<br /><br />And a cliff-hanger ending. Altogether a very satisfactory book in this series and Mr Connelly is forgiven, by me at least, for any previous lapses.
0062064304|5.0|Seriously one of the best art of books. Plenty of text detailing the design process behind the designs that actually made it into the film. An amazing peak inside every artists dream studio, Weta Workshop. Pick this book up!!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I read this book as part of my book club. I enjoyed the book.<br /><br />Robin Sloan writes well and kept his story enjoyable and entertaining. He truly kept a great perspective on past, present and future.<br /><br />I loved the story...a secret society that is trying to translate a five-hundred year old coded written masterpiece in order to learn the secret to immortality. The use of book stores to recruit new members to the society. And I loved the outcome.
B00A0SMTXS|4.0|The movie didn't actually have as many twists or turns as I maybe would have liked, but over all very good. Visually amazing, much like a modern Blade Runner. The designs of Stephan Martiniere are absolutely killer. All in all a great entertaining movie if you enjoy fast paced Sci-Fi action. I would recommend it for sure.
B00003CXA6|1.0|It was scratched. So this was extremely inconvenient for my daughter. It was for an AP assignment for high school :((
0375507256|2.0|I saw the previews for the movie, and I couldn't wait to see it. Then I decided to read the novel before going to see the movie. The problem is,I can't get into the book. The writing has a lot of humor to it, which I do like, but the wording, the stylistic prose, the way it's not really a story but a story told through letters, I don't know. I'm trying, I tried, and I'm still trying, to get through all of it. I've almost given up though and am just going to watch the movie. Maybe after I watch the movie, I can come back to the book and see it differently.<br /><br />And it's really not that I can't read things with substance or that require effort. I am not a fluff reader, never have been. I can keep up with a convoluted or twisting storyline with the best of them. This just doesn't grab me. It's probably a personal preference. I simply don't like the 'language' of it or the feel of it enough to really get into the storyline of it.<br /><br />I know those who love this book (and/or movie) are going to probably bash this review, but I'm just being honest about my opinion of the writing style and the prose of the book. It's not compelling. It doesn't grab you. It doesn't move you along the pages. It's plodding and slow and a bit boring. It's written in old stylistic prose, so some of the phrasing and wording, though appropriate to the period, is tedious for reading. There is no real story here, since the beginning is a series of letters, so you don't get a real storyline. It's intriguing in that it's almost like spying on someone's personal life, but there's nothing that exciting happening to make it worth the spying on them.<br /><br />Tedium, really. I mean, it would be like someone reading letters I might write home to my brother or mother from a summer camp adventure, boring and not important to anyone but the recipient. I don't understand why I should care about the characters, and they don't feel like characters or a story to me.<br /><br />It does get a little better by the middle, but I just don't ever get that feeling that the book grabs me and makes me want to read it.better by the middle, but I just don't ever get that feeling that the book grabs me and makes me want to read it.

B00633W614|3.0|I found the nook to a fascinating read from beginning to end. Archer developed the characters in such a clever way that each became real life associates.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I just watched the first 2 episodes, last night. I'm really loving the scenery and debauchery.  It has a great 1920s feel but characters are done in a way that I can totally relate to.  I do have to wonder if people in the 1920s said the &#34;f word,&#34; constantly.  I know my grandma didn't, ever, and she did say a lot of swear words and she did drink bathtub gin.  But, nonetheless, they sure do in Boardwalk.  But, yes, I'm looking forward to watching more, tonight, and enjoying the rich visuals and we are so happy that the starring actor has such a GRAND part.  My grandma did use that word, and she was a swinging chick in the 1920s. Great show! Great acting! Quite grand, does show a lot of breasts, speaking of swinging.

B004H1YH66|5.0|Bottom Line Upfront: Buy this if you don't have the original recording. If your original Conan is a bit worn or you like variation in hearing the same piece, this is definitely worth a repurchase.  As a bonus, it also has a few additional tracks from Conan the Destroyer and a Conan Animated Cartoon.

B005A1ER0I|4.0|The only complaint I have with this album is that it took so long to finally come out.  The quality and content of the music is amazing, and the only reason it is not 5/5 is that it is just a slight step below Two Steps From Hell (i.e., Bergersen does get better with his partner).  Put another way, if you only have money for this album or a Two Steps album, by the latter--but if you have money for all of those albums +1, this is the +1.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|It's Maggie Smith, I adore her. Is there a spirit world? Can we look into the past and see an imprint of what went on in our relatives household two centuries apart? This story just kept me rivetted on it.  The young man who played Tolly Oldknow (Alex Etel)was an excellent choice for this role.  He also appeared as the young boy in Cranford, who was sent to school to learn to read. It is 1944 and 13 year old Tolly Oldknow is sent to spend Christmas with his grandmother, (Maggie Smith) while his mother searches for news of his father in wartime London. In the old house, he becomes a witness to events during the Napoleonic wars and finds himself slowly drawn into participting in the drama.  A wonderful entertaining story........I highly recommend it. Will be watching it again over the upcoming holidays.

B003MOHX8S|5.0|This was Two Steps From Hell's first album and it very much holds up over two years later.  If you are a fan of film scores to set the mood or give you inspiration, you will find plenty of it here.  If you have limited funds, my suggestion would be to go to YouTube and figure out which tracks you like between Archangel / Invincible then mix and match (although you will probably find that a bit difficult--the music's that good).

B004VBAHG6|5.0|I have no doubts I recognize some fragments in this record... captured from Dandy Wharols tunes, or Melissa Auf der Maur debuct album. But... who cares? Velocity Bird is an eternal stone rock you can listen to death, it never lets you alone in the rock and roll-forever-party. Other masterpiece is placed on track number two, with the wonderful Seesaw Sway, an electro-ballad, and along till the last song, with such a variety flavours by Peter's epical voice, at its best form. From darkest moments to an happy ska, or passages through really slow decadent tunnels, this record cannot be absent in your library if you declare to be a rock lover to the world...
B009GX7IRA|5.0|I enjoy viewing each episode. The new season is action packed and keeps me glued to the set.<br />I would highly recommend downloading the newest episodes of NCIS to watch at another time.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|this is a really good game but I'm stuck on one of the levels where you have a Tv on the right side of the room it is a hard level but this game is really challenging but fun at the same time I think anyone who gets or tryst this game will like it because it really is a good game.
B0091REZMW|3.0|This was the best game that I have played for its type.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes this kind of game. This type of game is still kind of sad. 2d and crazy sloppy looking environments are really weak. Keys are a bad way to work the scaling of levels in this game.
B001VLBDD0|1.0|Despite the product description online AND as stated on the box cover, this dvd does NOT include the theatrical release. Only the extended director's cut is included.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Good sound with a good beat, all the way through! The lyrics can be hard to pick out, but once you follow along you pull a deeper meaning out of each line. Mumford and Sons are excellent performers and gifted songwriters.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Great book. I really enjoyed the plot. The love story sucks you in and makes you want to be a part of their world.
B007MG360G|3.0|Its fun and entertains the kids and is os intresting and it is os much fun and os that why I like to play it os much.
B000HA4WTI|5.0|Very action pack with a little drama. It showed how two different people settled their argument other than fighting. The cars where fantastic along with the women. I recommend this movie to everybody who enjoys cars.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I was all set to love this book based on the reviews, the structure and the subject matter. I didn't. It took me about three times as long to read this book as others of similar length and complexity. I will try to read another of Mitchell's books, but it will probably be some time before I do so.<br /><br />The book is a collection of narratives about the life path of a soul in various time periods. I probably would have liked the story better if I had liked the characters more, or if the writing itself had been more compelling. The later is a matter of personal taste, but to me the craftsmanship was not equal to the story. Of the characters, the only ones I really cared for were the woman. The composer whose score the title of the book comes from, I cared for least. The writing styles displayed have been done better by other authors. That said, if you care for literature for litterateurs sake, read the book. It is ambitious and different.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|The story was entertaining, and the book was a fun read. Not much depth to the characters, for my taste.
B009329ZF2|3.0|but glad I didn't go a theater to watch. lots of action. plot makes little logical sense. (how do you get a mothballed battleship into battle in less than a day?)
0547884591|5.0|If you ever felt that thrusting desire to get something you wanted, this is the book you must read. I can tell you that after reading the 4-hour work week and the 4-hour body, it helped make my life more pleasant on many different levels.  With these three books on the shelf, it'll probably be the only reference books you'll ever need to navigate through life's choices. Way to go Tim!<br /><br />- James
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this is a really fun game. its very addictive.  just like thr Pc version. can't think of any way it can get any better.  what's better than free.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead doesn't romanticize anything. It shows what people would really go throw if they found themselves in that horrible situation. The acting and sets are great. You can help but relate to the characters.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is my favorite writer. I have read all of his books.<br />Would recomend to anyone that likes fast action packed reading.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|I live in a relatively smaller city, and since Moonrise Kingdom was never put into general release, I would never have seen it except for a chance opportunity while visiting my daughter in Chicago last summer.  I had never heard of it, and wasn't even that excited about seeing it, since I'd never seen any advertising or a trailer for it.  My mistake!  While a movie that is loaded with stars doesn't always guarantee an excellent movie, this movie delivers!  Bill Murray, Bruce Willis, Ed Norton, Frances McDormand, Tilda Swinton, Harvey Keitel and all the various young newcomers featured, all deliver amazing performances.  This is a really &#34;quirky&#34; movie with characters who are all dysfunctional in some way, but you will laugh and cry, and after watching it will say, &#34;that is the best movie I've seen in a long time!&#34;  I just bought the DVD for each of my adult kids as a stocking stuffer because I want them to have the opportunity to see it and enjoy it as much as I did.  You won't be disappointed!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you read book One and Two, you have to read Three. I am waiting for a book Four !!
B009DB60W4|5.0|The first time I have listened to les Fleurs Du Mal I was a little bit disappointed and couldn't finish the album to the last song. I was expecting more powerful and energetic songs which Therion has always delivered. But if you listen second or third time the songs fascinate you.They are very melodic, emotional and harmonized with vocals and instruments. I am still listening to the first 8 songs which don't let you go into the second part of the album. Second hakf of Mon Amour, Mon Ami and Polichinelle are the best tunes which you can count among Therion's. Don't hesitate to buy this album. It's even recomended for anyone who will listen to Therion for the first time.
B000W93CHC|5.0|MAGNIFICENT, I WAS WALKING WITH THE RESIDENTS OF KINGSBRIDGE AND W A T C HED BREATLESS AS MERTHUM BUILT THE TALLEST BUILDING IN ENGLAND.
0307352145|4.0|This book has explained who I am and why I had issues with my loud, extroverted family members.  I always felt like the \\"red-headed stepchild\\" but now I know why.  Highly recommended for both personality types.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|It's unfortunate that the Kindle is not more &#34;camera friendly&#34;.  Really, how many picture do you need to take of yourself.  Well the kindle camera is really only good for that function.  I guess if all you want is video chat, the Kindle camera is fine, but If you try to take a photo of anything else, it is cumbersome and pretty useless.
0553062182|5.0|I've been one of those people who have been &#34;shy&#34; and crowd phobic; not only that, but I'm very emotional.  This book explained me to myself and now I'm more understanding and accepting of who/what I am.
B007SGM084|1.0|This book has no depth. Silly ridiculous stories heavily accented bouts of unrealistic sex. Should have purchased the books instead of kindle edition so I could tangibly toss them.
B009FZFONO|5.0|My wife and I have been addicted since the start.  Michonne is badass, btw.  I recommend every season of this show and hope it continues to be awesome.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Very cute love story . Kincaid drags on and skips big periods of time but still good . I liked it
B00A14SQBU|3.0|Compared to Back to Basics, this new album doesn't quite sound like her style. This album sounds much more mainstream than her previous works. Out of the 13 songs, only 4 are worthwhile which includes the radio hit, &#34;Your Body&#34;.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I really enjoy solitaire. The only part I do not like is having a hard time making a selection. Many times I can not get the options to come up on the screen. 1/27/13 Upon further getting acquainted with my Kindle and the game, I discovered I was having a difficult time getting the selection screen up due to my little fat fingers. Ha! Some things on the Kindle take smaller fingers than I have. I finally learned to tap a little further to the left and the screen would pop up. Yeah! Game on!
B00003003S|3.0|\\"Live Era '87-93\\"  Like all bands ,I think Guns N Roses sound better on studio recordings.  But I do really like the longer piano piece at the beginning of \\" November Rain\\". A good albumn for big fans of Guns & Roses.
0345528581|5.0|Absolutely amazing, fitness-in-a-nutshell information and program. Mark does any amazing job of breaking down the key components to better fitness. He's motivating and inspiring. He puts fitness in your grasp.
B001HBYH9Q|3.0|It has been so long since I saw &#34;Notting Hill&#34; I should watch it again. I feel unquailfied now to rate it. I probably enjoyed since it stars Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts. But I don't really remember. Sorry about that.
B004XGN8W4|3.0|I wanted a way to easily transport my Xbox 360 to a friend's house (or anywhere else that makes sense).  This allows that, plus it has a built-in ~15\\" screen to play on.  Perfect, right?  Mostly.<br /><br />Yes, it transports my Xbox console along with its power \\"brick\\" and other necessary accessories.  And yes, the built-in screen is JUST good enough to be acceptable for console gaming (the screen could use a better viewing angle and better color/contrast overall).  But the gaming case can only really store one controller in the case, because the rest of the space goes to other wires needed for this case to do its job.  There's an HDMI cable (from the Xbox to the screen), and a power adapter and wire for the screen.  Here's where the shortcomings begin...<br /><br />Too many wires without an effective wire management system inside the case.  If I have to power two devices (video game console and screen), I would expect that the wiring for these devices is neatly organized inside the case for quick and easy gaming on the go.  I want to open the case, plug the whole thing in (ONE POWER PLUG IN THE WALL PLEASE!), take out my controller, hit power, and play.  Instead, I have take all of the wires and adapter out, plug them all in to the devices inside the case, maneuver those wires a bit, plug TWO power adapter into the wall (or power strip).  Couldn't it have been everything all ready to go inside the case, and just run one power cable into the wall?  That would have made A LOT more sense.  Of course, this wiring/setup issue really only adds a minute or two to the process... but it's just not very convenient, and I think it could have been done better.  BUT IT ALL WORKS despite my complaint about wiring (don't hate me for hating), and this is my only real complaint.  So moving on...<br /><br />Last complaint (a little one)... is that the case doesn't offer much protection to the devices inside.  I know that the makers of this \\"mobile system\\" do not claim it protects well, so it's not false advertising.  But certainly, if I have these relatively fragile electronic devices in a cool-looking mobile carry case... my expectation is that they're decently protected.  I don't think they are, honestly.  For JUST carrying?  Sure.  And once it's placed down, set up, and being used... no problem.  But on the go... my concern is one good drop or similar incident -- and something is not going to work when you hit power next time.<br /><br />I'll end with this: I really like this thing.  I only focused on the complaints because in reality -- this thing is pretty much what it needs to be.  I can pretty easily lug my big Xbox over to a friend's place and play beside him without transporting TV's around his house?  AWESOME.  And look cool in the process?  (From a gamer's view, anyway...)  Very nice.  I'm excited to have this thing, especially since the idea for something like this has been in every gamers' head since they first grabbed a video game controller.  I would like to see improvements in the next iteration of this thing (and I believe there may actually be a newer one - or two - as I write this).  But for what it is, and what I paid... I have no regrets about my purchase.<br /><br />You a gamer?  Know one?  Dream of moving about the world with your console-of-choice in tow?  This is it.  This is the thing you need.
B00000IQW5|4.0|&#34; Always&#34; This is very entertaining, but it is strictly fantasy. Richard Dreyfuss character is killed in an accident and comes back from the dead to help his girlfriend. He has to learn to communicate with her since of course he is a ghost.Enjoyable if you don't mind it being about something that is impossible.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|it is a cool lego. it is small but it has nice details. my 9 year old likes it. i wish they had more lego for girls.
B001BR3ORC|4.0|&#34;The Secret of My Success&#34; was the first Michael J Fox movie I ever saw. I enjoyed it, even if it  was kind of silly. I recommend to his fans.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|I used this with my Senior Modern Literature class after reading, &#34;The Stranger.&#34;  We used it to compare existential ideals.  It worked really well!
B0038P59A0|3.0|I didn't keep up with &#34;Sherlock Holmes(2010) very well at the begining of it. I think it got more interesting later in the movie. I recommend for Robert Downey jr fans and fans of Jude Law. Like some other people though I had trouble with some of the dialog.
B0086700CM|5.0|I got this for my kids and haven't let them play because I'm completely hooked!  I strongly recommend for adults and kids if you can hand it over.
B00005JMXX|4.0|&#34;The Day After Tomorrow&#34;  I enjoyed this movie very much. I like action adventure movies, they are some of my favorites.I recommend it for people who like stories set in the future with unbelievable situations.People in this are racing to save mankind when a new iceage is begining with little time to help themselves.
0345803485|3.0|A bit of a story line, sex was every other paragraph, no one can sustain that kind of energy.  Sex scenes were not gross just over the top in quantity.
B000YHG72E|3.0|&#34;Elf&#34; I enjoyed the first few and last few minutes of this more than the rest of it. It got too silly for my taste in the middle of the movie. Will Ferrell too much like a child in that part of the movie. I know he plays an elf, the title character, but it's just too silly for me. He was raised by an elf at the North Pole, then goes to find his real father when he finds out he isn't really an elf after all.I recommend it more for young children.
B001RXB4FY|5.0|My husband turned me on to this band when we first met, so when they released this album I bought it for him. He loves it and still listens to it frequently.<br /><br />The great thing about Volbeat is their albums are always true to their type of music. You can always expect greatness.
B001HM1PFO|2.0|I gave &#34; The Rocky Horror Picture Show&#34; a second chance.I still liked it about as much as like writing movie reviews, not at all.<br />I don't know what all the big deal is about this movie, why some people watch it over and over. It is just boring to me.I won't fall for all the hype about it anymore.
B000YPUFA6|3.0|Movie got here and was very happy as now I have all the movies.  Only issue is near the end the dvd stops and won't play the end :(
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy to learn but extremely addictive. Once you start, this game becomes impossible to walk away from. The best part is that it is free!
0545265355|5.0|I'm not going to write a summary of these books because you can find that anywhere. This product is of all three books. They each are great looking with a nice sleeve over each one. They are grouped in a great hard cardboard casing to keep them safe. If your a fan of the movie or the books and you want a nice clean collection then this is the product for you.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good Family movie. Fun for the whole family. Sound and video quality were both good. I'd recommend this movie without a doubt
B006ZNRD06|2.0|Simply didn't work well on the Coby tablet. I ended up deleting the app after many freezes. Quite happy that it was a free app.
B0017P520U|5.0|Had to buy for my son's class, hard to find.  Thankfully Amazon had it in stock.  The book was easy enough to read and very intriguing to my 15 year old son.  He enjoyed the story.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|As much as I didn't want to like this series, I found myself enthralled. I've had to take breaks from it from time to time - just to focus on something a little lighter. But, I do believe I'll be a fan to the end.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I would've given this app a 5 star rating, however, there are some differences in the operation on my kindle than on my android phone. First you have to download an offline version for the kindle and second you don't get all the features with the offline version on the kindle that you do on the android phone such as access to the notes, plans, highlight and the oratory just to name a few. Please amazon and youversion, get together and correct these few problems in order to make the bible app a five star.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|App would not download.  I tryed many times and then gave up.  If I want facebook I have to go through google.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Great movie with tons of action and some humor that made the movie a lot better. Good plot and acting
B00992CF6W|5.0|Shockingly, this is accually a very fun and addictive game. Great for customizing. The creative modes a tad boring but survival, lots of fun there. Would definetly recomend it to any gamer out there.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|It took me a while to convince myself i could buy a flashlight for over $100, but now that it is mine, i don't regret it.Many reviewers have already stated the amazing power and quality of this flashlight and i can only confirm it.I'm pretty sure this is the most amazing light i've ever owned and will ever have in my possession.I was very happy to receive the improved u2 860 lumens version when i had ordered the regular tk41 800 lumens.After buying over the years many different types between $10 and $30 flashlights, i might have found a way to stop that &#34;addiction&#34;.The reason being, i don't think i cannot top this quality unless i really go another big step and buy a flashlight in the $300/400 range which i definitely will not do.This lamp feels really good in the hand and the 2 buttons are very smooth and easily reachable even in pitch black.I wish it would have come with a good holster and a better quality box.The plastic box offers a good protection but is quite basic for a lamp of this category.Overall very happy with the purchase, i bought my last flashlight ever, and hopefully will enjoy it for a long time.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Baby Harrison has entered Dexter and Rita's lives. And with it, the accompanying nappies, feedings and sleep deprivation. For a serial killer like Dexter, this is a recipe for disaster. Yet he tries to satiate both his Dark Passenger and his familial and work-related commitments. His top priority at the season's outset is to sleep, not abduct, slaughter and dispose of his latest victim.<br /><br />Disaster strikes as he heads home after a \\"project\\" leading to a road accident at the end of the first episode. He has no memory of what happened to his victim's body. His only cause for relief is that the police didn't find it near the wreckage.<br /><br />Lundy returns to hunt a serial killer, a 30-year veteran he has dubbed \\"Trinity\\", after the pattern of murders he leaves behind. Lundy later tells Deb that this is the only way he can relax. In a nutshell, he is a high-functioning psychopath who has channeled his lack of emotion and calm demeanour towards a productive and socially beneficial aim.<br /><br />Dexter finds Trinity, but there is more to this killer and his Dark Passenger than simply ritual. Season 4's climax builds over several episodes, and when you think it has finally arrived, you are once again reminded that there are twelve episodes in total, and there are still four left.<br /><br />There are a few segments that slow down the breakneck pace of the season, but they are few and far between. The final scene will leave you too terrified to sleep or ***** for several days (spoiler omitted).
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I feel compelled to write a review after reading many of the negative reviews here on Amazon. So to clarify things, yes it is a \\"CG Animated Film\\". I suppose that can be a deal breaker for some. However if you can get past that, you will see a good movie that does an excellent job of staying true to the original Starship Troopers. The CG is very well done and in many scenes, it can be mistaken for a \\"live action\\" movie.  Overall it seemed like everything fit in with the Starship Troopers Universe and I got the feeling that the creators of this film were huge fans of the series. If you liked the novel or the first movie and can \\"accept\\" or even enjoy a good CG animated film, then I definitely recommend this one!
0316113506|5.0|This is one of the most amazing books I have ever read!  The information of how the brain uses exercise is astonishing! It is difficult to follow medical descriptions, but I get the idea that the author knows what he is talking about.  Any teacher or parent or person with emotional problems should read this book!
B008KYOCA2|2.0|I have this app on my droid phone & it links to my Google Calendar, it works great. On my Kindle Fire you can't link to the Google Calendar this make the app useless, I am not moving all my Calendar information off Google Calendar.  Need to be able to link to Google Calendar on the Kindle Fire for this app to be useful!!
1572816295|5.0|I bought these cards as a gift for a friend- we found them to be almost Victorian and Tim-Burtonesque in their style. So far they've been working well for her as she continues to practice reading. She's a beginner, I'm a bit more seasoned, and we both love them! Also, they arrived quickly, so A+ for the seller
B0091LS07E|3.0|im a huge fan of alicia, but i have to be honest this album deserve no more than 3 stars :(  i look forward to her next album
B009A87Z6U|4.0|Excellent movie, great prize!! Highly recommend it. The box came intact no issues, and works OK with my PS3! .
B00006LLLN|5.0|I will preface this by saying that I'm not particularly a fan of bluegrass nor this band itself.<br /><br />With that said, this is exceptional musicianship here. Alison's voice is both strong and pretty. The band plays without a flaw yet maintains the liveliness that you look for on a live album. The subject matter of the songs can get repetitive at times, but with such beautiful melodies and the perfect execution. You can't help but awe when you listen to this. The production of this album also needs to be applauded for maintaining good dynamic range throughout the album.<br /><br />In short: If you enjoy pretty female vocal, vocal harmonies or acoustic set. This is highly recommended.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King does it again, enjoyed the references to his other books, discreet but evident,  really enjoyed reading this one
B000AGTPUK|5.0|My absolute favorite Christmas film. It's an action-packed visual delight, especially for those who love trains and winter. The basic theme of trying to revive the simple joys of childlike faith at any age will touch people who have totally lost it. There's nothing  saccharine or religious about this enchanting film. The multilevel story just unfolds and, in its gentle ending, it gives one pause for thought.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|easy to use, needs a little more updating.  Wish the purchase options were more detailed<br />convenient when not near laptop
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My son was thrilled to receive this advent calendar and can't wait to see what hides behind each door, he is a huge fan of lego
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read and hard to put down!  Can't wait to read the rest of the books!! A surprising love story like no other!
B005COO1X6|5.0|I didn't know it was a short story.. but i loved it.. read the whole thing in 8 hours... was hard to put down!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Gillian Flynn does a great job in developing the plot line and characters.<br />Thrillers are my favorite type of book.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I got bored with the sex .... i mean how many times can you dominate someone in the bed and make it sexy?
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This brings back the John Corey Smart As* that we have grown to love. The first half of the book is far funnier, if you like Corey's Rapier wit, but the back half is more exciting.<br /><br />Loved this book.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|It was okay... he gives into her tears and insecurities.... maybe the third one will be better. But then I expected more.. much more.... the sex is rank and crass!
0061777250|5.0|Re: Consciousness Beyond Life, The Science of the Near Death Experience by Pim van Lommel, M.D.  From the last few thousand years there have been reports of mystical experiences that have given rise to religious belief systems scorned today by the materialism of science.  Three things have recently changed.  One is that physics, once the anchor of materialism, is now exploring the depths of quantum phenomena, confronting the relevance of non-local information persistence and efficacy.  Second, science is incapable of delivering its long-promised 'theory of everything' (TOE).  There are five different theories but no objective unity.  Third, thousands of patients recovering in recent times from near death experiences (NDEs) are reporting, through author Pim van Lommel and numerous other highly skilled medical professionals, conscious experiences during their clinical death that resemble earlier such reports from ancient times; reports that appear to certify consciousness beyond life with its theological implications.  It would seem that the physical body and brain is but a 'transducer' that translates experience/information into permanent (non-local) form.  All this has exactly one meaning:  Creation is the flight of the eternal Subject from eternal sameness into eternal constructive novelty, where novelty is not possible except that the perceptions of the Integral Subject Agent (the good reader) be constrained by the imposed limits of time and space in a magnificent contrived universe of endless wonder and challenge.  Science will never deliver its theory of everything (TOE) for the simple reason that the physical is not fundamental, but &#34;created&#34; in the deepest sense.  Van Lommel's work is but the beginning of perhaps the most profound and hopeful revolution in human understanding and culture in the history of our species.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is the bible for publishing to the Kindle: and it is produced and more comprehensive than those offered at all of the other ebook sellers sites. Very well done and spot on for information.
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Not as good as earilier stuff, but it's Dylan and he is still around.  I'm enjoying it.  It's worth it.
6305692572|5.0|Saw this along time ago saw that you had it on DVD had to by it what a romatic and tearful story
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a very enjoyable movie............It was delibered on time. and the quality was fantastic. it was wellworth the wait.
B002HFWBUI|2.0|Was not as great as I thought it would be it was okay but not a must buy movie. it was okay
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|I had only a passing acquaintance with the \\"Animals\\" album although I had like what I heard. I am a belated Pink Floyd fan, having several of their other albums, mostly in older CD versions. Now listening to this 2011 remaster, I am impressed not only by the music but the sound. I was blown away by the quality of the remastering. I've heard very few new, much less over 30 year old albums sound so amazing! I have good equipment: Oppo BDP-95 player, NAD amp, Vandersteen speakers and subwoofer. Good enough to hear what's there. The sound was brilliant: enveloping, clear, involving to a degree I would not have expected. I bought the new \\"Lapse of Reason\\" album, recorded ten years more recently at the same time. Surprisingly, the older album was much better in both quality of music (maybe not surprising with the full original band) and sound!<br />Now I'm eager to check out the other remasters.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Love her, love the new cd, can't wait to hear more. She's an incredible artist, it's different, but this cd is much vulgar than her last.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|The kids picked this one to watch.  I am not into the whole Santa thing, I think the Christmas holiday needs to focus more on its namesake.  But my wife and I laughed and enjoyed the movie very much.<br /><br />The movie focused more on doing the right thing and going above and beyond when the odds are stacked against you.  Something that seems to be lacking in today's society.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two does not disappoint! It pulls you further into the connection between Christian and Anastasia. The writing continues to be amazingly descriptive and intriguing.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This book is both enjoyable to read and has takeaways you can use at your job when you are working in change management.
1400052181|5.0|I add my voice to the many kudos and awards \\"Immortal Life\\" has won since its publication. There are multiple fascinating stories within this book, that of Henrietta Lacks herself, of how her cells have advanced medical research and of the long saga of her family to fully understand Henrietta's life and the impact of her contribution to science. It's also the story of medical and pharmaceutical industries profiting from Henrietta's cells while being oblivious to the concerns of her family and only belatedly recognizing her contribution. The author does not belabor this point, but the book inherently critiques America's health care system. Despite their matriarch's incredible contribution to the welfare of millions, the Lackses are a poor family who have no insurance to help them with their own illnesses.<br /><br />I have enormous respect for Rebecca's Skloot's persistence in investigating the story of Henrietta Lacks and her descendants. She spent years earning their trust, unraveling their story and presenting it to us in this can't-wait-to-turn-the-page book. I'm kind of a science idiot, and I thought that aspect of the book might lose me. But the science never gets too complex, and what there is she explains very simply and clearly so that most readers should have no problem grasping it. It's much more than a science book anyway.<br /><br />\\"Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is the inter-generational story of an American family, the impact of racism and poverty on their lives, and their quest for truth and understanding. The chapter in which Henrietta's daughter and son were finally able to view their mother's live cells projected on a screen in a lab was tear-inducing for this reader. What an extraordinary, true story! This book is an instant American classic.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|i love the ice age movies and this stays with the theme! way to go! fun seeing all the cool ice age critters!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Of Course I love pinterest and easy to navigate on my kindle and iphone. thanks so much...i love pinterest. d
B0049VZ222|4.0|Engrossing plot, imaginative.  However, like the series Lost...often too much melodrama and bad acting and bad scripting.  And often gratuitous violence that goes over the top of what is needed.
B008458O3S|5.0|I love trains; however, that is not relevant - what is relevant is that this game is extremely entertaining, well conceived and executed.<br /><br />If you love mind benders, you will love the challenges put forth by the little trains that could... (sorry, just had to :) ).  But seriously, the ever increasing difficulties of the puzzles will draw you further in and believe me, even though they start out easy they get very, very tough.<br /><br />Oh, and don't forget to watch the credits :)
B000053VAF|5.0|I've seen this movie a ton and finally decided to purchase it as a gift for someone who also really liked it. It's got a wonderful cast, it's hilarious, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart and it doesn't fit everyone's sense of humor.
B0091LF2QQ|5.0|I have had this album playing on repeat in my car for days.  It is absolutely stunning.  It contains a great mix of musical styles.  I like some songs more than others, but it is a solid album altogether.  I love Mika's ballads, and Track 5, Underwater, is my new favorite.  If it is possible to \\"wear out\\" a track in a CD, I might just do it to this one.  And it sounds even better the louder it is played!
B009A9BF5G|4.0|This seems shorter than the concert.  A few songs left out?  Should compare the contents to the set list on the Coldplay website.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Just boring. Turned it off because we couldn't get into it. Expected more from such top actors. Wish I could get my money back.
1619691809|5.0|I can't wait for Nelson DeMille's books to be released.  This John Cory story was in keeping with the tradition of awesome storytelling of his previous volumes.  In this book he adds to the enjoyment by including characters from other books he's written, and a true DeMille fan will be delighted to know the backgrounds of these characters &#34;stories&#34; and enjoy how he's incorporated them.  If you hate terrorists and enjoy true American good guys, I guarantee you will enjoy this book.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun and addicting. The higher the level u go up the harder it gets. plus noodlecake has some other good games.
B007JMW46U|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a little unbelievable in his logic and observation skills but the twists and turns of the stories are fun to try to figure out.
0385535147|1.0|What a disappointment. None of the characters in this book have any redeeming qualities; there is no one to 'root' for; I feel as if I spent 400 pages with a bunch of immoral crooks involved in a hard to believe situations. Glad I got it from the library - Mr Grisham should be ashamed of this one. Here's hoping the next one is a return to form for him.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Another great book by Abercrombie. Maybe not as good as his previous works but still very enjoyable. If you like his other books you'll like this
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Good movie for the whole family.  We all enjoy watching this movie.  Funny and sweet.  We love the minions the most.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Now can keep up with contacts on my Kindle as well as my PC and Iphone!! Never loose touch with updates.
1400049628|5.0|I feel prepared now! It has a good how to guide to prep you for the fight to come. Max Brooks will be hailed as a savior.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|Second installment of Iron Man which eventually leads up to The Avengers movie! Can hardly wait for Iron Man 3
B0086700CM|4.0|I am a nanny. And I have had many children play and enjoy this game. This game  does not create any anxiety or stress, like some games do when children play video games. It keeps their interest and is challenging enough with no frustration.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Got hooked on this version of Angry Birds while playing with my grandsons on their Kindle!! Such fun and lots of laughs!!
1432794426|5.0|This book is an indepth look at the man, Michael Jackson.  Dr. Moriarty does an excellent job in helping the reader understand who Michael was; an amazing father, and one of a kind entertainer. I liked that she showed the human side of Michael, and did so in a repectable way.  This book seems very well researched, and is a perfect addition to my collection.  The world needs more books like this one. This book honors Michael's legacy, and you won't be sorry for purchasing this beautiful book about the King of Pop, Michael Jackson!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Really love playing these games! These are fun and entertaining - and a good way to de-stress at the end of the day.
B006LSZECO|4.0|What an amazingly well-written book. Gone Girl became extremely interesting about 52% of the way through with a very unexpected twist that kept me on the edge of my seat. I love reading about seriously psychologically messed up people and I got everything that I wanted and more out of this book. I will definitely check out Flynn's first two novels after being blown away by Gone Girl. The only thing that prevented me from giving it the full 5 stars was the extremely slow build up, once we got to the climax I couldn't put the book down.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just a great way to challenge yourself and have lots of fun doing it! Great game to compete against yourself to get higher scores on the various levels of play.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book.  BUT I must confess I never cried as much.  I will recommend it to all my friends.  Its one of the best reads all year.
B009FZFONO|5.0|awesome series that keeps you on your toes!!! no cast member is safe!!!! the Walking dead is a MUST HAVE if you like zombie apocalypse movies!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|u will love this. fun and engaging and will make time fly by. best game app out there. slightly different than the macbook version.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I can't seem to change the location or info for this app to my hometown, it will be deleted. It looks nice but doesn't preform as I want it to.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for.and it came in 2 weeks before the expected date! Thanks a lot!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|another great book with lots of background information, very interesting story about life, love and the World War ll time.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This application is so easy to use, has so many editing options and, is so superior to all other Pdf apps I've tried that now I edit all my pdf files on my kindle instead of the PC. Adobe has really done an outstanding job! :)
B004XVMCPI|3.0|Its not in english didn't read that it was English subtitles only. Its a great movie but without subtitles even better.
B000003N7F|5.0|I bought this album for my husband as a gift, and he plays it on Sunday afternoons for that perfect sunday feel.  Highly recommend.
B000FC13MM|5.0|This book is one of my favorite fantasy stories I've ever and probably where my future love of all things undead/zombified began. It's an adventure story through a world I have yet to experience anywhere else. The lore of the world is deep and unique. Whether it's the wall that separates the magical and non-magical realms, the various bells utilized by The Abhorsen, or the likable characters that drive the story forward, this is a must read for anyone who's tired of dragons, elves, wizards, and vampires.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I bought this record for my husband, and he plays it on lazy weekend afternoons and sets us both in a more relaxed, contemplative mood.  I love the music - a great Bon Iver collection.
B007SGM084|1.0|Nothing but a pornographic film on paper.  Absolutely no literary value to these books at all.  I finished Book One, hoping a story line would develop, but it didn't.  Since I had purchased (and wasted my money) on the trilogy, I started Book Two but didn't finish it.  And just skimmed through Book Three in search of some value, again disappointed.  I am ashamed that I fell for the media hype about this trilogy.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|The man is brilliant.  I bought this record for my husband, and along with other White albums, have really come to appreciate White's brilliance with music.  This album has a nice mix of pace and sounds, and is a perfect addition to your Jack White collection.
B005HSL626|1.0|We have tried three times now to load and play this - it will not run.  Very disapointing.  Wish it would work, as we've played it on an Apple...
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I have followed Fiona ardently since late high school when a friend-musician turned me on to her first album.  Yes, Fiona is melodramatic, but YES, she is also musically brilliant.  I love the way she plays with sounds and intervals, beats and melodies.  Always ecstatic when Fiona releases another album.
0375507256|5.0|I loved Cloud Atlas, though it definitely takes some getting into, and I didn't love it at first. It is a fascinating story, spanning over six time periods: the 19th century, the 1930s, the 1970s, the present day, a near-future Big Brother type society in Korea, post-apocalyptic Hawaii, and then back again. David Mitchell is a really amazing writer. This one is so different from Black Swan Green, yet equally well done, and certainly more complex. I really enjoyed all of the stories here, with possibly the exception of the first and last story, the one in the 19th century. The writing was a bit off-putting there, though the second half of it was good. David Mitchell shifts almost effortlessly from historical fiction to science fiction.<br /><br />The next obvious question is: are the stories interconnected? And yes, they are. In each one, some mention is made of either a person or a book or a piece of music in the previous story. And there are some more subtle references as well, like the comet-shaped birthmark that many of the characters share. As you may know, a movie just came out of Cloud Atlas. I may watch it, though I doubt it's as good as the book.<br /><br />This one has really great characters. I especially liked Luisa Rey, the smart and sharp journalist from the 1970s. She's determined to uncover the truth, no matter the consequences, and I really admired that about her. Sonmi-451 is not bad either, and very smart.<br /><br />I liked the way that Mitchell structured the book too. Each of the first sections of the stories ends on a cliffhanger: either the sentence cuts off in the middle or something momentous happens, and you just have to wait until it comes back around again (though of course, you could cheat and skip ahead, if only to see whether the character survives).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this one, but if you find the first section a little boring, stick with it. The rest are much better.<br /><br />My blog is located at novareviews.blogspot.com (Cleo's Literary Reviews).
B0099QWLH6|5.0|This was my first introduction to Sedaris years ago.. I have since read many more of his stories, but Holidays on Ice really tops my list.  I recently bought several more copies to give out as Christmas gifts - it is the perfect stocking stuffer!
B004IV5AKM|5.0|Beautifully acted.  Inspiring in its message that dreams count, even if you are not able to fulfill them very well.
B00004T9AS|1.0|Earth Moving flat out stinks.  A big steaming pile of you know what.  Take that steaming pile, add another scoop of stinkage and well, you have this horrendous flop of an album.  Gone are the epic and adventurous multi-part suites that we associate with a creative and original brand of world music that Mike Oldfield is responsible for bringing to light 15 years earlier.  In its place lies utter garbage.<br /><br />The pop songs were bad enough, but this... THIS?!?!?  Whatever Mike Oldfield was going for here is completely unacceptable.  \\"Nothing But\\" shows that Oldfield was interested in mainstream soul that the likes of Whitney Houston and several others brought into the picture.  While not a bad type of music by itself, ask yourself this- does it REALLY belong on a Mike Oldfield album?  Absolutely not.  \\"Bridge to Paradise\\" has the same generic guitar work that Kenny Loggins used on \\"Danger Zone\\" and the vocals even resemble Kenny Loggins quite a bit.  For some reason though, I don't *completely* hate this song.  The cheese factor is enormously strong but the melody itself (especially the chorus) has something appealing about it.  \\"Building a bridge to paradise\\"  Yes, I'd like to build one to my personal paradise... where albums such as Five Miles Out, Ommadawn and Tubular Bells stand above the clouds!<br /><br />\\"Holy\\" has forgettable vocals.  It's caught somewhere in between commercial spirituality and pop music.  For me it doesn't work very well, but at least the vocals sound honest enough.  The chorus is obviously trying to mimmick the early 70's Moody Blues because it sounds like a severely watered down version of \\"Isn't Life Strange?\\"  Still, I actually like the song.  Perhaps there is a legitimate attempt at putting Oldfield's vision in a different light here, but my gut feeling tells me that it's probably all a big put-on and just an attempt at going commercial which means we can't take it as seriously as Oldfield's golden year period (1973-1981).  AdrianBelew does a nice job singing the melody at any rate.  A far cry from his King Crimson days of course.  I keep thinking \\"Far Country\\" is actually \\"Far Cry\\" (which is fitting, really).  Soulful, over-sentimental vocals that don't blend well at all with Oldfield's style- I hate this song.  I have a lot of trouble even sitting through it, in fact.<br /><br />\\"Hostage\\" makes the fatal mistake of including horns and heavy guitars at the same time.  Not a big deal any other time.  I mean Genesis used to combine the two really well and those songs are terrific.  So what's the problem here?  The songwriting is mid-tempo boredom and the lead singer sounds identical to Noddy Holder, the lead singer of Slade minus the soaring range.  \\"Runaway Son\\" sounds like the theme song to some horribly dated family-oriented show from the mid 80's.<br /><br />NOW do people understand why I'm so hard on the 80's?  This is why originality is important- without it, everything turns bland and sounds the same.  I honestly feel nauseous right now.  This is just awful, awful awful.  HIGHLY recommended that you skip this.  This isn't even Mike Oldfield.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This is the best show ever :) :)  The characters are so funny and refreshing as a cast.  So glad Fox wised up and did not cast a bunch of boring celebrities and instead chose fresh new faces to create this show.<br />5 thumbs up!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|Gift for grand daughter, loves to stick on wall and then move them around. Nice way to spend time with my granddaughter.
B009C7JS14|3.0|Visually appealing, but limited functions (so you are enticed to buy the paid version I am sure!). Only can have 2 locaions in the free version.
0740797719|5.0|This is a very large and heavy book - an excellent reference with large glossy color pages - nearly EVERY page. Many examples of great master's work and then a good bit of Gurney's work, too. The tone is conversational and not preachy. The color wheel samples are particularly useful - he shows several styles and I rather like that.<br /><br />This book was recommended to me by a very good oil artist friend and I'm very, very glad I followed his advice to get this book. I'm impressed by the examples, the format and the instruction. This one's a keeper.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|I liked the movie for what it was. Reminded me alot of \\"Blow\\" and I loved that movie. Drug selling situation gone array.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I felt like I was robbed, knowing that i had to buy and download the  camera app for the kindle fire hd.Please make it free for all.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This movied was action packed and fun to watch.<br />I have already recommended this movie to friends<br />and family. My wife liked it also.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Had an older model by another manufacturer that I was using with moderate satisfaction.  My roommate had gotten this last Christmas and I instantly loved it.  Heads up display is much appreciated.  Full programmable keys with useful macro software.  Also having an actual joystick instead of a 4-button imitation is a worthy upgrade.
B003Q6D5PM|5.0|i am 46 year old lady that has been struggling to cope with my emotions and life because of my parents. I was abused very badly by my mother and thought it was all my fault and i didn't know my father was as bad as my mother until i had my children and relized that he let her do it to me and he never stopped her. This book has made me relise that it wasn't my fault and i am having help know to deal with it all.
B007EECSFA|4.0|This is a very interesting plot, with surprises all the way till the end.  The characters are well defined and introduced into the story in interesting ways.
B009KUANWG|5.0|I love Adele, she is the perfect singer for this song and I cannot stop my kindle to play it continuously....
B00846REIS|4.0|I am struggling with a rating for this book for several different reasons.<br /><br />The Comparison<br />I picked this book up because I was intrigued by the Fifty Shades Trilogy, but was looking for something with a little bit more oomph, for lack of a better term. What I got was a book that felt too closely similar to Fifty. I felt this book lacked originality. I am not dismissing t Ms. Day’s creativity, but I think the idea to create this book came from reading Fifty and she stayed a little too close to that feel…which could be genius since it is available to piggy-back the Trilogy that is so very popular. As an avid reader I see those similarities, but for someone who seldom reads this may just be what they are looking for.<br /><br /> The Sex<br />The sex is hot, not going to lie, but it seemed to be used a little too often. Gideon and Eva have major issues and they both used sex to try to fix their selves. When I began the book I was under the impression that this would dabble into some BDSM, this does not. There is no restraining or spanking, it is rather vanilla with some hard humping (totally hot, but I was looking for that next step up). That being said, with the emotional issues the characters have because of abuse that kind of play wouldn’t have worked very well…maybe next book!<br /><br /> The Writing<br />The writing style is good. My two complaints, which is why I am struggling with the rating, is that I don’t feel like I have an emotional connection with Gideon. I don’t know what makes him tick, I would have liked to have had his point of view thrown into the writing as well. My second complaint is that there is no climax. I feel like we just got a look into the characters and their lives without having an high emotional experience. Towards the end I just kept thinking- okay something is going to happen that is going to be some cliffhanger- then it just ends. I was left thinking why. What was the point other than sex, why did I read it other than the Fifty comparison, why will I read the next one?<br /><br /> Overall Thoughts<br />Having made all those point I have to look at this from a neutral point of view. If I was just a fan of Erotic Romance who had not read Fifty Shades what would I think? My issues with the writing (connection and climax) would still stand. As an Erotic story this is well done, in comparison with other books I have read in the same genre.<br /><br />So my overall rating is between a 4
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Great book, its good to acknowledge the things that some people sacrifice for their country.  Regardless in what capacity they serve but once they serve with conviction and their heart that's what makes it worthwhile and honorable.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This is book 2 in the Crossfire Series.  Frankly book one was better-and I wasn’t even a huge fan of that book. A couple of thoughts kept running through my mind as I was reading this…”What the Hell,” “Stupid idiots,” “Clingy bastards,” “Sex fiends,” and “GROW UP” were pretty much all I could think about throughout the first half. Seriously What the Hell! I pretty much hate Eva for putting up with all the CRAP Gideon dishes out to her. Seriously why would someone in their right mind deal with any of that. Sure she has issues, but come on.<br /><br />We finally get to know a little about what happened to Gideon and after that little discovery all either of them can think about is sex. Oh wait a minute that’s all that these characters have is hot marathon sex where no one is every tired no one is ever over sexed and the orgasms are endless.<br /><br />The last part of the books was the best, by far. I am hoping the third book wraps everything up and they can both HEAL their mental issues instead of forgetting they exist through sex.<br /><br />Sylvia Day has done one thing right…she has created a train wreck. Its messy, it pretty well sucks, but like all train wreck bystanders I just can’t take my eyes off of it. I will undoubtedly by the next one because for some odd reason I want to know what happens.
B0054JELS4|5.0|love these.  We can go back and watch when ever we want.  The DVD's played well.  We have enjoyed them over and over again.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|please. update. to mobile version. plewse I love the game but I need to be able to upgrade my armour
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This has to be one of the most awful books I've read.  Echoed by my girlfriend.  Get's somewhat interesting in the second half, but really not worth the read.  As a disclaimer, we generally read historical fiction, so if romantic novels with a dark side are you thing, this will probably appeal.  As always, your mileage may vary.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|This one was really good. I was surprised because the trailer looked kind of run of the mill. Grandpa Santa played a much bigger role than the ads suggested. Good story, good moral, we had a really great family movie night watching this one.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This movie is great...I truly enjoyed it, over and over again.  I recommend it to any one who like the old Sherlock Holmes movies.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I lovenminecraft. that's all there is to it. but I wish you could download this for free and be able to play if you loving with your Pc account. that way, a lot more people would have fun
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play this while I watch tv--it's harmless, mindless fun.  There are two main levels, one of which is more likely, though not certainly to end in a win than the other.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|David Mack gives us another fantastic Star Trek story.  He gives life to a character (Dr. Noonien Soong) that the television series did not have time to do.  I am looking forward to the next two in the trilogy.<br /><br />There is one thing that I wish the authors of Star Trek novels would do, however, and that is to spell out phonetically the more complex names they come up with for people and places.  If they would do that with the first appearance of the name in the book it would make reading it a bit easier.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This can be addictive.  It's fun while watching tv, waiting for planes or waiting at the dentist's or doctor's office.  I play it less as time goes on.
B00A1XOPE8|3.0|Generally I am a big fan of Brandon but this short story was a bit too predicable for my taste. The idea behind the story is good but I do miss a bit more action compares to other works of Brandon. Don't get me wrong this is absolutely readable and I would still recommend it but do not expect too much from this short story.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|I discovered this through reading a blog through the Kindle special deals app.  I am excited to have this.  It's a sure cure for boredom while waiting in airports, doctor's offices, etc.  The TED lectures are, as the Kindle blog says, &#34;continuing education.&#34;

1609611543|4.0|Well written, easy to read and packed full of useful information. I also recommend reading Sweet Tea and Cornbread by Karrie Marchbanks. It's a Chrisitan self-help book geared towards African American Women's Health and I found it funny, insightful and powerful. Both are defiintely worth the money.<br />[[ASIN:1478233036 Sweet Tea and Cornbread: Inspiring, Motivating and Empowering Black Women to Take Back Their Bodies & Live a Healthier Lifestyle (Volume 1)]]

B0084U0IEG|5.0|Multilayered, multifaceted, and with acute observations about life in the 1970s, literature and our view of the world. I enjoyed it so much that I am reading for a second time (although my reason only becomes clear when Sweet Tooth is read to the end).
B0053TWV46|1.0|My DVD player does not want to play this to begin with.  I've seen it before so buying it was a mistake - truly.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|Took a long time to download, ate a lot of space and then wouldn't even work.  Would only play the intro and then lock up.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book kept me turning page after page. Most of my friends have already read them. Can't wait to read the next one.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|O m g this last book of the hunger games is boring at first first but totally twice much as better at the end. The action, adventure, and litle romance made the book to die for. I love it so much.
B006PTZNSY|1.0|This album sucks really badly...just listen to her garbage on the radio. I got this as a gift, but quickly gave it away..No thanks!
B009DJB9HC|5.0|If you  enjoyed the first two offerings by BCC you will love this one! After BCC 2 I was afraid the quality of work would be less than on the third disc.But it is even better.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I first got BARAKA many years ago, this is one of my all time favorites, some people don't understand it, thats ok, it is a journey, what we are, what the world is, AMAZING!
B005KR6O58|5.0|I love this movie! Couldnt find it anywhere locally so I decided to check Amazon and bought it! Great movie for all ages and I plan on my kids watching this one day.
B0088TG252|5.0|We will watch almost anything with Denzel Washington.  He is always believeable and interesting.  Ryan Reynolds did well, also.  They interaction was just right.  This movie has enough action without going overboard.  The story and the ending really held our interest!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app and use it every time I am in need of quick basic calculations. Balancing the check book? No problem!
B007X15GRQ|5.0|Lots of action and very good acting.  Mark Wahlberg rarely disappoints and he held our interest throughout the movie.  The story was interesting and all of the actors did fine jobs.
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown is a true hero in every sense of the word.  The book is a very interesting read about Adam, and his struggles, his achievments, and in his  giving of himself while protecting this country.
B009H2PCNC|5.0|There is a select library of albums that I play at bedtime and this has quickly become one of my favorites. It's a time of day when I'm vulnerable and need to be serene. This highly accomplished album is most theraputic.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy the game but am not interested in purchasing items needed to play the entire game.  Doesnt seem fair to use other people's info to play.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always, John Grisham gets your interest right off.  I am still reading the novel as I have other things to do, but I am enjoying the book.  I have read most of his books.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of The best TV series I have ever seen . I really enjoyed and best wishes for them .
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I it so much fun to play, but quite challenging.  It was a quick download. It is very different from the other Angry Bird games, new birds.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|The best super hero movie ever. Packaging is lame though for a four disc blu-ray set. The movie deserves 5 stars but the packaging deserves better for such a great movie.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|So not only can the Grandkids be entertained, but so am I. This movie has a good message for kids- be YOURSELF, yet at the same time, be careful of what you wish for.<br /><br />The picture and audio quality are great, and not much to distract you from the entertainment. You're likely interested in the movie as you're reading these reviews, so buy it already.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|My device would run the Opera mini browser, but I was told to try this one instead. And it works great! I'm glad I got it!
0316069485|5.0|I have all of his Lincoln Lawyer novels. Simply love the main character. I wish he would write more with this main character.
B007HACDLK|5.0|MITCH RABB IS AT HIS BEST IN THE UP TO DATE STORY. SEVERAL TWIST AND A ENDING LEAVEING ROOM FOR A SEQUEL. I WOULD SAY DO NOT MISS THIS BOOK.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Ok I gave it five stars, and that was probably a little generous, but although I feel there were some flaws here and there, they were minor and overall this was a dynamite story. No spoilers from me, but if you wanna get an idea of what this book is sort of about, picture yourself stuck in a building for a very long time with high ranking members of today's Democratic party running things. Now you can understand the choking horror of this story.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|I got this for my 8 year old grandson cor Christmas. Right after the purchase he came home from school and said that he played this really good game at school and that it makes him think and is's so much fun. It turned out to be Lego Creationary! He'll be surprised at Christmas.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|There isn't. much difference between this app and any other chess app but this one has never crashed on me, it's. not slow either and can be quite a challenge. all in all it was a really great app I got for free.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This film is worth the watch. Great acting and good story.Old gangster movie with lots of action and gives good insight of times during the moonshine era.
B0091REZMW|5.0|we have been playing it abit each night and have enjoyed it so far.  fun game especially for the price Would recommend. to anyone who has children
B007JNWQZS|4.0|The movie is great. Sound perfect in a hi-fi 5.1 system and highly recommended for that, since speakers sounds crisp and clear. The presentation box is quite simple, so is not recommended for collectioners. Maybe a little box or envelope could be better for that. But the movie is special for home cinemas. You'll have a good time watching this.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious and at the time it was a good chunk of time since a movie this funny had been out!  Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum are hilarious and work very well together!  Guest star at the end was a huge surprise!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|So refreshing to watch quality, well-written and produced television. More shows should break out of the CSI/Law & Order box. No more bland television, please. If I'm spending lots of hard-earned money on television service, I like to get some content that's worth my time to view.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I love this show. We have 2 children so when it is time to watch this show it is our time. It is amazing love it. What more can I say.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very intriging. Can't wait for what is gonna happen next and hoping that Grey's heart can be healed. I love both the characters.
B009AP2G26|4.0|Sue is her usual hilariously funny self. Finn seems to be maturing nicely and Kurt is beginning to realize that there is more to being an adult than he thought.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Everyone in my office said that I had to read this book, I will admit book #1 not bad, of course it leaves you guessing what will happen next and so I had to purchase #2 & 3, but i'm mad that I did, I was bored, and was thinking to myself, what else does this book have to offer besides SEX, and the mere craziness along the way. I was determined to finish the trilogy, (just to see what I was missing)<br />The book was so boring to me that after I finshed reading all 3, I instantly deleted from my kindle.<br />I am not a fan in the least.
B0000046ZJ|5.0|I highly recommend this.  I have enjoyed Stan Get's music for 20 years and I would rate this among his best.  Ditto for Oscar Peterson.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I literally had to force myself to read the final book, after reading #2, I was bored and wanted to stop reading, but of course you want to know how it ends,<br />Now that I know, so glad I can move on to something a little bit more interesting.<br />I honestly don't see what the big deal is with this book, but each it's own.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|This is a great collection of some of Kelly's biggest hits and new songs. Kelly is more than deserving of a greatest hits CD and is very underestimated. Her talent is boundless and there is no better live singer touring (with the exception of maybe Adele) Her live show is captivating because of her flawless vocal talents and genuine likability. Not to mention 75 awards, 135 nomination, 5 studio albums  Did you know that \\"My Life Would Suck Without You\\", surpassed \\"Before Your Love\\"/\\"A Moment Like This\\" for the biggest leap to number one on a single week in the history of the Billboard Hot 100 Chart, a record it still holds today! That is staying power and Kelly will be here for a long time with many Greatest Hits albums to come! I would go for the Deluxe version as it includes more songs including: I Don't Hook Up, A Beautiful Disater-live, Darkside & The Trouble With Love AND a DVD of 14 Kelly Videos. What more could you ask for?  KC>all
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I bought a copy for my boyfriend and a copy for me! What can I say? I just love it so much!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My wife loves the book. Shipped and arrived on time and will continue to purchase books from Amazon for kids school requirements.
B0050PYNN0|5.0|Sort of like a Tropic Thunder kind of humor, but with A LOT more mature humor in it. I am not easily shocked but even *I* dropped my chin twice. But then again this is the unrated version, huh? LMAO.
B008RA3X5E|2.0|Just to be on the safe side,  I had a back-up alarm the first two mornings. The alarm failed both days.  When I tried to test it (alarm set for one minute from now) it failed two out of three times. Had to uninstall. Sorry that I paid for the ad-free version.
B008G8SFGO|2.0|Despite all the hype and long-awaited (delayed) release--after a U.S. tour that occurred BEFORE the release of this album--I can only come to one conclusion:  the album is one of their worst.  Carnival of Souls:  Worst followed by Monster.  There are indeed 3 good songs on the album--but NOT promoted in this order:  (1) All For the Love of Rock & Roll (performed by Eric Singer, (2) Outta This World (Simmons), and (3) Hell or Hallelujah (Stanley).  The rest are below par.<br /><br />The days of Stanley/Simmons collaboration, it appears, are over.  Now we have \\"Gene\\" songs and \\"Paul\\" songs. . .and, on Monster, we have ONE song they \\"let\\" Eric Singer sing--and he does a great job.  I think the song was written by Paul.<br /><br />The album will leave no memories and, after having read all of the Kiss books lately (Peter Criss, Ace Frehley, et al.) now I'm never sure WHO is playing on the album.  Is it Tommy Thayer and Eric Singer...with Paul and Gene or are they studio session musicians?<br /><br />Save your money.  Don't let Paul push \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\" on you as the \\"single\\" from this album.  It should be \\"All for the Love of Rock & Roll\\" by Eric Singer.  This will become his \\"Beth\\" even though it was written by Paul.<br /><br />They are one-half a tribute band; their shows are stale, they have a Tour BEFORE an album is released and likely they'll tour, again, to \\"support\\" this album. . .calling it the \\"Monster\\" tour.<br /><br />I love Kiss.  My favorite band (besides the Beatles). . .but this album gets (barely) 2 stars out of 5.
B006C1DH92|1.0|I cannot give a good rate to this my boy is the one that use it, I think it is ok game..!
B00007KMOX|5.0|This is the one you want in your collection if you like Beethoven. Even if you don't like Beethoven. You won't be sorry.
B007MDB548|5.0|I ordered this movie for my Granddaughter and she loved it!  In fact, the whole family enjoyed it!  It is the cutest movie!
B000002UAC|5.0|By the time this album was released in the UK (its release date, November 22nd 1963, happened to coincide with JFK's assassination), Beatlemania was in full swing in Britain. The band had already had 4 hit singles, 2 (or 3, depending on which chart you use) of which had gone to #1 and were shortly to be followed by 'I Want To Hold Your Hand'. 'She Loves You' had been in the charts for 3 months and had recently gone back up to #1. The first album, 'Please Please Me', had been the #1 album for 29 weeks and only another Beatles album was going to knock it off the top. If ever an album was set up for the sophomore jinx to strike, this was it. There was no way for The Beatles to meet the expectations their career thus far had created.<br /><br />This background is important, because 'With The Beatles' is one of the most overlooked Beatles albums. Its anonymity is further enhanced by the imminent breakthrough of the band in America. 'With The Beatles' was reshaped in the US and retitled 'Meet The Beatles' and millions of American fans still remember that as the first and most exciting Beatles album they ever heard- rightly, because MTB is a great album.<br /><br />However, 'With The Beatles', now the definitive second album in the Beatles CD canon, really does hold up extraordinarily well. It follows the formula of the first album in offering 8 originals and 6 covers. The covers chosen for this album are very strong, with three out-and-out rockers ('Please Mr. Postman', 'Roll Over Beethoven' and 'Money'), the ballad 'Til There Was You' and a powerful rendition of the Smokey Robinson song 'You Really Got A Hold On Me'. Only 'Devil In Her Heart' sounds like it was put in to make up the numbers.<br /><br />The originals aren't quite as strong by The Beatles' own standards. 'It Won't Be Long' is a powerful opener and Ringo delivers a rousing version of 'I Wanna Be Your Man'. Paul's catchy 'All My Loving' was deemed strong enough to be the opening song on the band's first Ed Sullivan show and George's songwriting debut 'Don't Bother Me' is noteworthy for introducing a different lyrical idea from the usual boy/girl relationship songs. However, the remaining four songs, 'All I've Got To Do', 'Little Child', 'Hold Me Tight' and 'Not A Second Time' are mid-tempo songs with less to make them memorable. Don't get me wrong, they are good songs which any other group of the time would love to have written and recorded. It's just that The Beatles had already set the bar so high that these songs fall a little short of their best work.<br /><br />Overall, the album is the hardest-rocking of all the band's albums. The Beatles are tighter musically than in their debut (no doubt because they were given more than one day to record this one!) and the album has a more professional feel. It doesn't have quite the variety of 'Please Please Me' or the raw, fresh sound of that record. Nevertheless, it's a worthy follow-up, as the inclusion of 9 of the tracks on 'Meet The Beatles' makes clear.<br /><br />The Beatles had overcome the fear that they couldn't back up their early success, and were on their way to becoming legends. Next stop America!
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I was entertained. Even though I think they gave the Broadway treatment to a music genre that did not need it, I still think they paid great tribute to some rock and roll songs. The movies charm is that it does not take itself to serious and allows you to do just the same. Realize that this is just some very talented singers/actors paying tribute to Rock and Roll and you will not be let down. It is very funny at times and told a classic rock and roll story. Give it a try, but have an open mind and realize it is not trying to replace the classics...just pay tribute.
B0001XALTG|5.0|If you are a cult follower of this film, this is a good addition to your collection. Great features and good quality.
B0000549B0|5.0|I love this movie.  The only thing we cannot figure out is why this DVD version doesn't show Harvey briefly.  We all remember seeing this movie long ago and at the end Harvey very briefly appears.  Did they edit this out?  Other than that, a classic that makes great entertainment.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Good  juxtaposition of fantasy & realism. I want to go to that circus. Usually I give up & read the ending without finishing. Not with this story. I didn't want to spoil any of the twists.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|As an Akita owner, I was interested in purchasing this movie and could never find it in the retail stores so I found it on Amazon.com and ordered it. I loved the movie even though the true story of Hachiko was put into modern day times and not set in Japan with a Japanese Professor. Good Movie!!
B002SRQ214|5.0|Recently upgraded from an AMD dual Core 6400 to this quad core along with a new MSI990 mobo, and 16gigs of Patriot RAM. I really am enjoying this big upgrade in performance. Very Fast so far reliable, run World of Warcraft amazingly. Much cheaper here than the computer stores online and in my area.
1400052181|5.0|This was a thought provoking book as you read about how many years they have been doing cancer research.  As a person who has lost many people due to cancer I appreciate the importance of the research.  I learned a lot about John Hopkins also.  It was a moral/ethical story about the family whose mother had unknowingly donated the cealls.  I could not helop but wonder how many other cancer patients had donated their cells also unknowingly. It was a very powerful story and thank you to the writer for researching and writing it.  I have recommended this book to many people but most of myfriends have already read it.
0691126887|5.0|I chose this product for gifting my boyfriend who is an ornithologist. He loved the guide and the price was very affordable.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|I found it to be enjoyable - not heavy, but simply a pleasant read. Actually the ending was a catch 22 - happy and not so. I recommend it for an easy read...
B00271SFB6|5.0|I've always loved James Bond movies and with Daniel Craig as James Bond what's not to love? I recently bought the anniversary set in blu ray.
B002NLY0V4|5.0|For those of us that like to have our favorite movies proudly displayed in a case, and that are fans of this show, this is a great addition to your collection.  Arguably, one of the best seasons of this great show, season 5 picks up right after the events of lilliths death.  Without any spoilers, I will let you know that I would have been perfectly happy had the show ended after the last episode of this season.
B000JML90Y|5.0|People tend to hold Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution by means of natural selection in either high regard or extremely low esteem depending on their own perspectives and opinions.  The reality is that too few people have actually read \\"On the Origin of Species.\\"  Even the majority of practicing professional biologists have not read the whole thing.<br /><br />I have read this book at least four times.  It is insightful, loaded with an overwhelming amount of empirical observation, and astute interpretation of those data.  Darwin crafted a well thought out theory.  His book sold out on the first day in 1859, and it has been in print pretty much ever since.  His theory has been under attack from the non-science community and under intense scrutiny by the scientific community for the past 150 years.  The result is that the theory is more complete and robust than ever.<br /><br />If you really want to know what's up with Darwin and his theory, read his book.  Amazon and Kindle have made it available for free.  Dive in and find out for yourself what is going on.<br /><br />If you do, be prepared for lots of examples of pigeons.  :-)<br /><br />This is a 5-star book, and every educated person in the world owes it to herself or himself to read it.<br /><br />Be informed, be educated, be amazed.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you have played Minecraft on the PC or Xbox, or if you are new to Minecraft, Minecraft PE is worth it. Has lots of features of normal Minecraft and some new items and is only lacking redstone dust (ore is included, but does not drop anything) the end, the Nether, and a little more. This game is worth it for sure!
B0045ODPKY|4.0|Angelina Jolie, currently one of the top actresses in Hollywood, headlines this action film as the lead character \\"Evelyn Salt\\".  Jolie plays a top CIA agent, expert at interrogation and infiltration.  One day an old Cold War era Soviet spy master walks into the CIA and tells a strange story, implicating Salt as a Soviet sleeper agent.<br /><br />Salt knows that if this man knows who she is that her husband is in danger, and she sets out to find and protect him.<br /><br />This film has enough action, deceit, and plot twists to keep any action/intrigue movie fan happy.<br /><br />The acting is good overall, the action is great, and the conclusion is gripping, just like it should be.<br /><br />A fun, escapist movie, well worth a look.<br /><br />A solid 4-star film.  I really liked it.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 7 year old and I play it all the time. fun, fast paced game that we enjoy together at home.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Even though this was just a preview, it looks like Downtown Abby will be a good season full of drama and suspense.  Can't wait to see it!
B000YABYLA|1.0|This popular movie gives a very wrong impression about the deeply complicated and painful experiences the birth mother and the baby have all their lives. It implies it is easy. But the baby experiences an acute abandonment trauma, and always yearns to reunite with his/her mother. The mother, too.<br /><br />In addition, babies slated for being given away are typically given up too soon. Recent research indicates that a newborn needs contact with its mother for at least six weeks after birth or it doesn't develop optimally.<br /><br />In the first season of Glee a girl gives her baby away as soon as it is born. There is no visible effect on the girl, no ambivalence or sense of loss. It is easy. The baby's experiences are unknown. A young girl I know, after watching these episodes, said, 'If you get pregnant you can just give the baby away!' She seemed relieved and as if she had learned a delightful new key to a possible future problem.<br /><br />I wonder how many many girls have developed this notion from the film only to find it doesn't work that way in real life, how many adoptees have been born and suffered who would not have had to suffer, because they become sloppy about saying no to sex when they don't really want it and/or get sloppy about properly and regularly using contraceptives.<br />I think this film is dangerous to girls and young women.<br /><br />From a long-time, former trauma and family psychotherapist.
B0037TPMOA|4.0|I'm a Stephen King fan, period, and always enjoy his books. However, the problem to me with the Shining is two-fold. Its stretches very long, giving needless background information that doesn't really aid the story. That being said, it wraps up leaving alot frustratingly unexplained. For example, its hinted that Jack Torrance knows the manager of the hotel, yet we never really find out who it is ( sorry if I've said too much). Or, did the events of the past cause the hotel to become evil, or did the evil hotel cause the present and past events to happen? Maybe that was King's purpose, to leave us guessing. But it didn't sit well with me.<br /><br />That being said, its still a good read. Definitely read it, but dont be surprised if you find it doesn't make your top 10 of favorite books.
B0011N1WE8|3.0|this movie while entertaining was just not what i expected.i watched it a second time several months later to see if the mood had changed,well not really.but a'm sure it's a good movie for the younger generation.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|The grandchildren will love watching this. It was interesting and a bit of a different story line. Great for children.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Had a little probably with certain parts of it but that is because of my blushing to use of some words!<br />I couldn't put the books down
B002QRWJA4|5.0|I bought it for my 17yr old daughter she watched and just loved it.So I bought it for christmas. ready
B003R0MF5I|5.0|I am enjoying every moment of this 4th season and will purchase the final season later! One of the best shows on TV !
B004Q9T4E4|4.0|I come from a scientific background but unfortunately don't know much history. I can't therefore comment on the details, the objectivity or the accuracy of the interpretation offered by Prof Ferguson in this book. I can however say that it is easy to read and rather engaging. I particularly liked the sweeping overview of long historical periods. I can't say I agree with everything the author says, but I do realise he made an effort to be objective with plenty of references to back up his view.<br /><br />The kindle version is easy on the eyes and relatively cheap. The layout of the pictures is not very convenient, though.
B009GESJH2|4.0|In typical Kid rock fashion this album runs the gamut, from rock, blues, county, soul, funk, and even a little gospel. There really isn't any the hip-hop or rap in any of the songs. I would rate it on par with Rock & Roll Jesus, but would have preferred it to be more like Cocky.<br /><br />If you are hardcore Kid Rock fan you will love it. Newer kid rock fans will definitely enjoy it too. People caught up in the political propaganda are gonna hate it, even if their own mother was sing backup vocals on it. If you are looking for Welcome to the Party or Early Morning Stoned Pimp you will probably be a little disappointed.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Christopher Nolan, while a brilliant film maker, isn't the most gracious when it comes to home releases. What I mean by this is that he has historically never really included deleted scenes or Director's Cuts of his movies. I would likely either wait for the deluxe edition or buy it also if we were getting extended directors cuts, but Nolan has pretty much squashed that by saying he doesn't do that; the film that hits theaters is the one he wants everyone to see.<br /><br />There have been rumors of deleted scenes with Ledger's Joker for TDK and there are confirmed cut scenes/story lines that tell much more of Bane's back story and evolution into the villain we see in TDKR. According to the woman who worked on the costumes and make up, we would see Bane's scared body after surgeries, early versions of the mask, the importance of a belt that he wears, and his LOS training. Before the film was screened, she confirmed that this was filmed and thought she was teasing parts of the movie. If I remember correctly, she said something along the lines of \\"I'd imagine it would be in the movie and not cut. They filmed it.\\" Based on Nolan's comments and rumors of a director's extended cut being debunked by WB, I don't see what more a deluxe edition could really offer besides little collector's items (that I personally don't really care about anyway). Commentary would be nice, but I doubt Nolan would go back and do that.<br /><br />So with virtually no chance of getting extended cuts or deleted scenes, why not just pick up the trilogy now for a great price? TDKR is $24.99. For $5 more you can get the other two films as well! I already own BB and TDK, but as a blu ray collector, I will welcome saving a little bit of space having all three in one neat package. Not to mention we get the little book to flip through if you aren't able to pop in the movie right away when it arrives.<br /><br />Obviously I haven't seen the film on blu ray yet, but I'm sure it will be spectacular. I'm buying these now at a great price because I don't think we will ever get extended editions in a deluxe package. Hope I'm wrong though!
B007S1RGUQ|4.0|Bonnie Raitt just gets better with age. Her voice has a more mellow tone than lets say, her Home Plate LP, from the 70's, and sounds fantastic. Her guitar playing as always is stellar. If you are even a just a casual fan of hers, I'd highly recommend this album. Her cover of Gerry Rafferty's Right Down the Line is almost worth the price of the album in and of itself.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I liked this book. Very different than most fantasy books! The author has a unique style that I enjoy very much!
B000SXBOP4|5.0|Even if you're not a huge Bowie fan, you really should add this LP to your collection. It was innovative in scope upon its release, with a rather dark view of the future of our planet, but even more importantly every tune is a winner. And how can you go wroing with lyrics like: &#34;My brain hurt like a warehouse&#34;?
B0086700CM|5.0|My granddaughter has it on her kindle fire and I downloaded it onto my  kindle fire its great. I love it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I have just about seen this over a dozen times.  The grand kids ask to watch it most every time they are over .
B009YU62H2|2.0|I bought this album solely out of nostalgia, and was disappointed. Out of the 13 tracks, none blew me away, and perhaps 3 or 4 at most caught my ear.  I found the remainder monotonous and unspectacular.  I considered giving this album 3 stars, again, out of nostalgia but I have to be brutally honest - this just isn't anything special.  Chris's voice sounds as amazing as ever, but the music is sorely lacking in the originality that we've come to associate with Soundgarden.
B00005RDRO|5.0|My kid loved it.  She had never seen this movie and enjoyed it very much.  Shipping was just great.  Is a nice addition to her DVD file.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another, &#34;can't put down&#34; fast moving adventure.  Intriguing characters and a very surprising plot<br />make this one of his best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the story.  Wish there was more to read.  This book kept me up several nights.  A must read for everyone.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|It is almost universally accepted that Persona 4 is one of the last greatest JRPGs.<br /><br />When it was announced that P4 would be receiving an HD remake with added features/scenarios, the buzz surrounding it was incredible. When it was announced that this remake would be exclusive to the Vita, a few people were very concerned/upset; but many more found it to be an intriguing choice - I was among the latter.<br /><br />I pre-ordered the 'Solid Gold Edition,' and when it came in I set aside my other responsibilities for a solid evening of gaming. Persona 4 Golden sucked me back into the Shin Megami Tensai universe, and I have been having a hard time putting it down. I have gotten more use out of my Vita in the past week than in the past several months. This game is spectacular.<br /><br />Everything they have added to Golden is a step in the right direction. The online functionality (the 'voice' function, SOS, etc) is never invasive, and often very helpful. The new character has a really interesting story, and very natural development & inclusion into the story. The new scenarios that are added are really fun. The new mechanics are more robust than what was in the original game. The ability to fast forward through cutscenes if you're reloading a previous save is a lifesaver. The list goes on.<br /><br />Overall, the package is completely positive. The only negative I can think of is that some people take issue with Chie's new voice actor. I think she does a great job, personally; but it seems that others don't like her - that is up to your own tastes.<br /><br />If you've never played Persona 4, this is absolutely the best version you will find. If you are a veteran to the Persona series, you should also give this a shot - you'll love all of the new additions & changes.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it.  Be prepared to be useless around the house.  Easy to read and hard to put the book down.
B00110K62U|5.0|Fantastic production and sound. Just love Les Miserables and have watched it a dozen times or more with different friends. Cannot wait to see the movie and will probably order that too when it is released on DVD.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Keeps you wanting to read more and more.  I was pretty much useless at home.  Too hard to put the book down.
B009DH372Y|5.0|Fabulous good digitally enhanced copy.<br /><br />Again cannot submit without a certain amount of words, please change this format or I won't bother making the effort to do it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Please hurry with an update...my son is driving me crazy about it. He really wants the levels with the pink bird.  Thanks! :)
B009SJ3BE6|5.0|Haha, i am gonna say this right. I don't have words to describe this show. Sternly recommending to watch it. Maybe with your family. Love it !!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I gave these books 5 stars because these are a set of books that you just can not put down. I find myself saying just one more chapter, even though I know that I have to get up quite early the next morning. The books flow. The characters are very well written, and you find yourself having a favourite character but also being attached to numerous others. These books are very long. A Game of Thrones has something in it for all readers - love and romance, deception, death, war and tactics and the list goes on. If there is a sample available before making your purchase I would highly recommend it, I would also recommend reading the books before watching the series on TV. Like all other books that are made into movies or long running seasons, the book is always better!!

B004X4R49Y|5.0|Exceptional Film!  Superb acting and story.  Both Colin Firth and Geoffery Rush were Oscar worthy.  This film is definetly not dry, as one might think.
034580404X|5.0|Outside of the graphic sexual content there's a story about a woman who's saved herself for someone special. A story about love conquering even the worst childhood trauma and the need for flexibility and compassion in relationships. It speaks to the idea that women need to respect themselves and demand the same respect from others, sometimes you have to make tough decisions to get your point across. And finally it gives us the idea that sex with someone you love should be fun, mutually gratifiying and special.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I would give a 5 if the &quot;invest&quot; points were not linked to FB. I love the build, its been fun.  Rock on G5!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I thought some parts needed to be more explained. I felt the story was a bit more less bland and the actors where okay at best. Would like to see another and more of a story behind all this.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I waited a long time to see this  follow on ,from Phantom of the Opera .Very well made, but I didnt like the ending much.

B004FRX0MY|1.0|I wanted this app for my Kindle fire and it says this app is not comparable really.  If there is a way to get this install on my Kindle fire let me know.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Although this book had slightly less Mitch Rapp in it than Mr Flynn's other books, it still was able to keep my interest from beginning to end. He also gave Irene Kennedy a bigger part which I believe is a good thing. As he usually does, Mr Flynn has left me with yearning for the next book. A very good read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I have so much fun with this game!! All you people who love Ice Age... GET THIS!! i just have trouble getting acorns ( which are important) unless you win them in a game or get them in snow piles or buy them with real money. So if you don't like buying them then it takes awhile to meet goals and stuff like that.... but if you buy them... WHERE IS THE FUN IN THAT? winning games for prizes and being patient is better (in my opinion) than spending more money. other than that, this game is very much like ice age.. they have new animals for sale and always have a new animal for you to get. So it makes it intresting.... the best part is, is that new things are happening every day!!!! i recommend it.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Great if you're a fan of Angry Birds or Starwars! Would definitely buy a paid version if available. Good Job.

B004Y8075M|5.0|Louis Lowry's The Giver is an award-winning Young Adult fictional novel found on the shelves of many Language Arts teachers and libraries. Many have summarized it as a coming of age book that is about a 12-year-old boy, Jonas, who lives in a perfect society. Lowry writes on the back cover, \\"Everything is under control. There is no war or fear or pain. There are no choices. Every person is assigned a role in the Community\\".<br /><br />When Jonas receives his life assignment to be the Receiver of Memories, he discovers secrets about the past, and the terrible choices that make this world possible. The previous Receiver, now called the Giver, trains him.<br /><br />The author continues, \\"The Giver alone holds the memories of the true pain and pleasure of life. Now it's time for Jonas to receive the truth.\\" Gradually Jonas comes to understand, and resent, the choices that had to be made to create his world, and the terrible secrets behind its perfection. Together he and the Giver concoct a plan to change the way his world works, but before they can carry it out Jonas is forced to make a decision that may destroy them all.<br /><br />For me as a student teacher and a parent of five adolescents/young adults, I found The Giver:<br /><br />* To be thought- and conversation provoking. I found the best part of reading The Giver is the many conversations it inspires -- from life and death, love and pain, and more.<br /><br />* To be anything but controlling for the reader. For a novel that is about control, I loved how Lowry left Jonas and Gabriel's fate up to the interpretation of the reader. The last moments of the novel were told in such as way that it allowed the reader wonder if Jonas and Gabriel's lives had ended (or released).<br /><br />* To be disturbing at times. I am concerned about age-inappropriate content for middle school students, including occultist themes and violence, sexually explicit material and the ideas of drug use, suicide and euthanasia. I found several passages unsettling:<br /><br />* Jonas' father punctures a newborn in the top of the forehead with a syringe full of lethal fluid. He talks to the crying baby, gently saying he knows it hurts. Then he nonchalantly wraps up the dead child and puts him in a trash bin.<br /><br />* Jonas and other young volunteers bathe the elderly in the House of the Old. People are forbidden to look at others naked, but this rule doesn't apply with infants or the elderly.<br /><br />* When Rosemary, the failed Receiver of Memory before Jonas, seeks release, she asks to inject the needle into herself.<br />While it may be commonplace for images as such to be on television and in the movies, I would want to make sure my students had plenty of opportunities to discuss, write, and or illustrate their thoughts and feelings.<br /><br />For me, the positives far outweigh the negatives of reading The Giver. This classic is a must read for all students who seek to broaden their understanding of life.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Larsson's Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, Girl Who Played with Fire, and Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest might not be for everyone. But the character development and story lines are truly not to be missed. You gotta read them all!
B000UJ48O0|5.0|The only downside is that its too big for your standard dvd collection. Its like a book/dvd case. Just like a book, it starts with an introduction from the creator and a list of the main cast, lots of artwork/pics from the show, along with a description for each episode including the writer, director, and original airdate. Comes with a hard plastic case to protect from dust and slots within the pages where the 28 discs are in. All the features from the individual dvd sets are included in this set. Definitely a MUST for fans.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|works great for me. Not much more to say. Took a while to run diagnostics, but after that it has been working like a champ.

B008IJTFYW|3.0|Very relaxing ambience but wish it would play in background while doing other things on Kindle Fire.  I rarely use it because of that.
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|If you loved Season 1, you will love this. A motorcycle gang in a small fictional town in CA. Law enforcement at times look the other way because there is an unwritten rule that any shenanigans should take place outside the city limits, and the biker, besides themselves, keep the bad elements out of the city. I love Jenna, played by Katey Sagal.
B0063GORYU|5.0|most challenging of solitaire games I have played. I like that when you get to winning alot, you can increase the challenge. Don't play alot (time constraints) but this has become my favorite over simple solitaire and freecell.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|No spoilers.<br /><br />I will have to admit, it took me several months to watch Alien from beginning to the end without closing my eyes during the really gross scenes. It wasn't until I watched the making of Alien that help me to move beyond dramatic scenes and watch how they created the aliens. So, when I heard Ridley Scott was creating a prequel to the blockbuster hit Alien I was kinda leary about going to the movies to see Prometheus. But, I ordered the movie and was pleasantly surprised it wasn't as gruesome as the 80's hit. Good storyline, two scientist are granted a multi-million dollar expedition into outerspace to conduct onsite research to find out who/what is behind the start of life on planet earth. What's funny to me is, they didn't have any type of security or planned protection if/when they got there, how to protech themselves.  They didn't have anything planned, no rules of engagement or protocol?!? They just jumpped off the spaceship and ran into a unknown cave and the movie went from there.<br /><br />Special effects were top notch, weird scences, and the ending was not satisfactory for me. But it is worth watching to anyone who is into sci-fi and/or a Alien fan. Good movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this so I could join in my 3 daughters conversation.  It was a good story and an easy read.  Too bad the movie did not do it justice.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Love this video and yes it does work if you stick to it.. The workouts are not very long which in my opinion makes it easier to stick with.
B001UU75WK|5.0|It's like a modern X-Files! Awesome! The special effects and directing make this show a little better even. The casting could have been done a little better but the writers make up for it.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Supernatural is one of my favorite shows - and now my husband's as well. The writing is superb, with witty dialogue, great action sequences, multiple subplots that all interconnect in the big picture, and memorable characters. A modern-day western style action-drama with demons and creepy crawlies. A must watch for anyone who likes movies with monsters and new takes on good and evil.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Took me less than 5 mins to fall asleep and I have trouble with insomnia. Like this app a lot. Even my 4 yr old likes creating sounds with it. The only thing I don't like about it is you cant listen while reading or surfing. That would be wonderful to have the app remain open like Pandora while you do other things on your device. All in all really enjoying this app and so many sound choices even on the free version. AWESOME

0061474355|5.0|This is the first book of Garth Nix's Old Kingdom Trilogy, wherein you will find an extremely original and surprising take on zombies. Zombies are all the rage these days, from regency-era zombies to your generic shot-to-the-head zombie horde, but you won't find anything comparable to what you'll find in \\"Sabriel\\", and its sequels \\"Lirael\\" and  \\"Abhorsen\\". Here, you will find zombies that can be created and destroyed by magic, specifically by a set of magical bells and the necromancer who wields them. And? Well read the rest yourself to find out!<br />\\"Sabriel\\" is smart, well-written with well developed characters, and with its perfect blend of fantasy, horror, romance, and adventure, is sure to appeal to guys and girls ages 13 and up (I'd rate this book PG-13, as there is some mature content in there). Be warned that once you read \\"Sabriel\\", you'll want to read \\"Lirael\\", and then you'll want to read \\"Abhorsen\\", and then you'll go looking for the short story set in the same world, and finally, you'll find yourself wishing that Garth Nix wrote more books and stories about the wonderful universe that he has created.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|The title is odd and gives no indication of the book's content. The book was recommended to me and I was pleasantly surprised. It is told from the viewpoint of a child with autism, with him discussing various things that happen in his life. The book offers excellent insight into how an autistic child may think. There is tremendous variety in how children on the autism spectrum present, but the book is an accurate reflection of some things that may be expected from children with this diagnosis.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The plot of Gone Girl is very cleverly unfolded, and one wonders where in the world the book is going.  For me, however, the ending was troubling.  I like things neatly wrapped up and, while it was resolved, it was unsettling and disturbing.

0547884591|5.0|As Hegel said, \\"Education is the art of making man ethical.\\" Now, you may be asking yourself and me, \\"Dude, why are you beginning your review with a Hegel quote, or a quote from anyone for that matter? Are you that pretentious: are you really 'that guy'?\\"<br />Firstly, quotes, whether taken out of context or not, give credence to the rhetorician wielding them; and, secondly, I've just shown two things that make Tim Ferriss and his newest book \\"The 4-Hour Chef\\" a must read. Let me explain.<br /><br />Have you ever read a book that claims it will teach you something only to open a book of quotes that have been robbed of their context to make you think you're learning something about the world and yourself? I know I have, and you have too. There is a difference between telling quotes to the reading and showing quotes, which is what, I argue, Ferriss does: he doesn't just provide an abstract quote \\"a good life is best lived when one provides themselves an understanding of x, y, z, \\"-(insert name of seemingly \\"enlightened\\" person), for Ferriss shows the reader how to live life more fully by telling stories and giving concrete examples.<br /><br />So, you want to learn a second, third, seventh, or, if you haven't already mastered someway of intuiting new languages just by smelling them a mile away, twenty-fifth language, Ferriss tells you how he did and continues to do it; to get a quick and powerful understanding of a language, he Deconstructs (like Bartelby the Scrivener, I would have \\"preferred not\\" to see the term Deconstruct(ion) used outside of the realm of Continental Philosophy) languages down into the 100 most used words, modal-auxiliaries (can, could, would, should, would like, etc.), and he asks native speakers, breaking all the rules with this one ya'll, for help. A really interesting story Ferriss provides is of Cardinal Giuseppi Mezofonti, who had a command of 39 languages and was, apparently, tested for fluency in up to 79 languages. Shit. In any case, Mezofonti's big secret, Ferriss says, is that when coming into contact with a new language he would ask a native speaker to write out the Lord's Prayer, which houses many of the structures of grammar and syntax needed to understand a language. All in all, Ferriss learned from his example and, upon meeting a new language, asks the native speaker 12 questions, the \\"Deconstruction Dozen,\\" that will help Ferriss intuit the rules that govern the new language's language-game.<br /><br />The above paragraph is the first of four big sections of the book dealing with Meta-Learning, or the Learning of Learning. If you thought Ferriss' friend Deconstruction, the section I explicated above, was a powerful tool for understanding then wait until you meet the other three friends making up the acronym DiSSS (Deconstruction, Selection, Sequencing, Stakes). Ferriss also provides the reader with the acronym CaFE (Compression, Frequency, and Encoding). All in all, these systems are a summation of every method, technique, habit, practice, you name it, for how to more easily understand, fully intuit, and pragmatically apply information.<br /><br />Here are three pros and cons, to display that this review is at least prima facie unbiased:<br /><br />Cons:<br />1) Could be more depth into memorization methods such as the Loci method. Although a seemingly very mysterious system, wherein one memorizes, let's say, a speech by placing pieces of it along a mentally constructed pathway, I am confident Ferriss could have provided an effective nutshell summation and example.<br /><br />2) The use of the word deconstruction is rampant throughout our context in history, and it is not being used appropriately in the context of its creator Derrida, so another word would have been nice.<br /><br />3) The meta-learning theory at the beginning could have been more explicitly applied throughout the rest of the book. DiSSS and CaFE model well to the understanding of creating amazing food, but applying it to everything and anything else is uncomfortable for those unsure of what they're doing; re-showing the methods in different contexts give the reader experience and practice so that they can apply it to piano or guitar or skiing or showering.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1) Section on language acquisition is out of this world. Even the brief story of Cardinal Mezofonti was a world shatterer. Thanks.<br /><br />2) I finally know how to make mayo from scratch that is firm. Amazing.<br /><br />3) My father is a veteran trained chef, who graduated top of his class at the prestigious Western Culinary Institute in the late 1980s, and this book scared the shit out of him. He's conservative, like Malcolm Gladwell, and told me that Ferriss theory simply couldn't produce any sort of good food in that short amount of time. We went through Ferriss' tips, tricks, and a few recipes together, and my father was surely impressed. He's coming around.<br /><br />So, thank you Tim Ferriss for the book.<br />To all of you who haven't read it yet, please do; it will change you in weird, wacky, and amazing ways; you'll be exactly who you've always wanted to be, but better. I promise.<br /><br />Live your history, love how you're living, and always focus and do what you love to be focusing on doing. This book is one of those books that will provide you the skills to get you ninety-nine percent of the way to your goals; however, remember, you have to do the impossible: you have to believe in yourself and leap the last one percent.<br /><br />Happy Thursday and Stay excellent,<br />Arlo Tobin

0553381407|5.0|This book is beyond any price I could have paid for it. It is only through reading this book, did I realize not all parents have the best interests of their children at heart. As an adult, I believe we want to think of our parents as perfect, but later on realize they are human and do make mistakes. Some of these mistakes, and the toxic effects it can have on us carry on with us as we become adults. We need to make peace with who we are and reclaim our life. It is life affirming and will change your life for the better.

B005DOKM9M|4.0|The Amazon Kindle Fire Zip Sleeve fits the device perfectly and works as a carrying case and minor protection for it. I got mine in charcoal and was surprised that the real thing looks less &#34;cheap&#34; than it does in its pictures. My only drawback for this product is the price. These sleeves regularly sell for $29.99, which is outrageous for this product. I got my as part of a bundle, so I saved $10. Even with this savings the price seems too high to me.

075666733X|5.0|I got this book because I'm a pre-nursing student about to take A&P next semester. I've taken it before and know allot of visual aid is needed. This book is full of up close pics and it exceeded my expectations because some of the written info explains types of disorders and processes related to the relevant anatomy. The best thing is that it is not complex where a person with no medical background could not comprehend it. It makes it quite plain and to the point. Whether you are in nursing class or a parent or just a mammal, I recommend this as a household book for reference for years and situations to come. I haven't had a chance to view the dvd yet, but it could only get better!

0375842209|5.0|Liesel is 9 years old when she watches her little brother die in their mother's arms. They are on a train to their new foster parents. Death, the narrator of this story, is on the train to take the brother's soul to eternity. Death is not a bad or evil presence, he has a job to do, which he isn't very fond of, but it has to be done.<br /><br />After Liesel's brother is buried and as she is leaving the cemetary, she stops to pick up a book the grave digger has dropped. The book, ' The Grave Digger's Handbook', is the first of many that Liesel will steal. Liesel is sent to live with her new foster parents. Her mother can no longer take care of her and her father was taken away by the Germans for supposedly being a Communist. Her new papa, Hans, begins to read the book Liesel has stolen, to Liesel when she wakes up every night from a nightmare. It is also the book he will use to teach her how to read.<br /><br />Liesel becomes very good friends with a neighbor boy, Rudy. Together, they will share in play, stealing, and being each others best friend.<br /><br />Han's past will catch up with him when a young jew named Max comes to live in his basement to hide from the Nazis. Max and Liesel form a friendship through books, stories of everyday life, and one book that will literally save Liesel's life.<br /><br />Here is a different voice of WWII. We hear from the German people and their horrifying time during the war with: the Nazi police, the youth groups, (which their children must participate), the air raids and bombings, recruitment into the war, survivors guilt, and the Jews marching through the streets like cattle and no one allowed to help them. Zusak is a gifted writer using words in a way that our group called poetic. His thematic and sensory descriptions take you swiftly through Liesel's story via Death's voice and observations. One major point in this story is how strong and powerful words are since that is what Hitler used to begin this war. I like what one member said about death, \\"Nobody gets out alive, it's how you get out that matters.\\"

1400052181|5.0|When the author took a community college biology class in 1988, her professor was explaining cancer cells and he wrote the name Henrietta Lacks on the board. He explained that Henrietta died in 1951 of cervical cancer. But, before she died, a surgeon took samples of her tumor and put them in a petri dish. The professor then added on that Henrietta was a black woman. Rebecca became intrigued about who the woman was behind the cells. She spent the next several years researching the story of the cells and that of Henrietta and her family.<br />Henrietta was born in Roanoke, Virginia in 1920. When her mother died, she returned to her father's family tobacco farm in Clover, VA. The family had farmed the same land since their slave ancestors. She grew up with her older cousin David, Day, Lacks. He was 5 years older. At age 14, Henrietta became pregnant with Day's child and they married. They had 5 children. Day was always cheating on Henrietta and gave her various STD'S.<br /><br />In 1951, after waiting a year, Henrietta went to John Hopkins Hospital to see a Doctor. She told them she had a knot in her womb. As the Dr. flipped through her chart from previous visits, he noted she had been diagnosed with neurosyphilis but had cancelled treatments. She had also tested positive for gonorrhea and increased cellular activity in the cervix. She had declined follow up treatment. Shortly after, Henrietta had given birth to a baby at the hospital yet, no tumor was detected at time of birth. Either it had been overlooked or it had grown that fast after 4 months. A sample of the tumor was taken and sent to pathology. When the Dr. began treatment on the tumor, he took samples of healthy tissue and the cancerous tissue. He then sent them to Dr. George Gey's lab. Gey was experimenting in growing cells from tissue. So far he was not having success in keeping cells alive. Henrietta's cells were different. They grew. He labeled his samples with the first two letters of the patient's firstand last name. These cells are now known as HeLa cells.<br /><br />HeLa cells with their unique properties became the cells to test every vaccine or procedure on. They were used to test the Salk vaccine for polio, radiation from a nuclear bomb, chemotherapy drugs, hormones, AIDS, deep sea diving and spaceflight. They were also infected with TB, salmonella and bacteria. It was later discovered that her cancer was caused by the HPV virus. HeLa cells became a researcher's dream. Factories were built to mass produce the cells. They were shipped all over the world, first freely by Dr. Gey, then for money by companies.<br />It wasn't until a Rolling Stone reporter showed up at the Lack's home in 1975, did the family find out that Henrietta's cells were still alive and being used for research. This had quite an effect on the family.<br /><br />Now in the 1990's, Ms. Skloot goes back to the Rolling Stone article and follows the research into the Lack's family. It takes time and patience but through numerous interviews and gaining confidence with the Lack's family, they let her in. Through a timeline back and forth, which aids in keeping track of where the author is in the book, we learn the science of the cells, the family relations of Henrietta, the ethical questions it raises about using cells from a donor or in many cases, not a donor, and making money from them. Henrietta's family never saw a cent from the millions the cells have made for companies. They have lived in poverty with no health insurance. I believe the book is very fair in showing both sides. Without testing on tissues, organs, blood, etc. after we are done with them, either in surgery or through lab work, there would be no way to find new cures for diseases. Yet, here is a family who could have really needed some compensation. Maybe John Hopkins could have at the very least provided free health care to the family as a sigh of good will. That is just my opinion. In the past couple of years, new laws have been written to protect the privacy and rights of the patients. We are a more informed patient.

0307352145|4.0|Susan Cain starts the book with a rerun of the MythOfRosaParks... the tired seamstress dead on her feet.  Get serious.  Rosa Parks was part of a genius NAACP strategy to bring the injustice of segregated public transportation to the notice of the community.  She planned it.  And it worked.  She wasn't a VICTIM she was a VICTOR.  If you get this wrong in the first 10 pages of the book, why should I keep reading?<br /><br />Soldiering on...<br /><br />Some of the best parts of the book were these:<br /><br />1) America has moved from a culture of character (Think Lincoln) to a culture of personality (Think Clinton).  That is an apt observation and one that explains the manic push for everyone to be frantically outgoing.<br />2) The book delves into the pressures of self-presentation -- mere competence and thorough knowledge is no longer enough to bring business success, you must be able (spontaneously) to present your material to a sometimes-hostile audience.<br />3) Overly stimulating environments impede learning and impair excellence not only for introverts, but for extroverts as well.  Bring back individual learning in schools and walls/cubicles in offices -- people need quiet, privacy, time for reflection, and space.<br />4) The high reactive/low reactive theory and studies with babies through teens was interestingly presented.<br />5) The phenomenon of pretend-extroversion is something you can witness nearly everywhere.<br />6) Finally, the way for introverts to become used to novelty (rather than recoil from it) is baby steps in subjects of interest.  Learning that it is worth it to punch through the wall of discomfort sometimes becomes a valuable perspective and helps introverts meet the world on their own terms.<br /><br />I thought the most useful part of the book was Chapter 11 -- guiding young introverts.  This is helpful information for anyone/anywhere in structuring environments where EVERYONE can participate.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Really enjoyed this, read it in three days.  This is one of those books you wish would never end. A dark story but filled with hope and redemption.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I won't say it's &#34;best ever&#34; or anything, there are still a few things that don't quite make sense but for this show I feel this is the best that they've done so far.  The season isn't over, but it's keeping it's momentum week to week as of the halfway point.
B00479SVBU|2.0|I originally had given this device 5 stars, but over time I had more & more problems with it.<br />When I first bought this, my original unit would \\"lock up\\" constantly.  I sent it back after a week.  The company replaced it quickly with absolutely no hassles.  I was very happy with their service and I still think highly of the company.<br />My replacement unit had a problem with the \\"shuffle\\" feature.  It would play the same songs over & over when on shuffle.  (I didn't have the first one long enough to say whether or not it had the same problem.)  Over time this became extremely annoying because I drive a lot for work.<br />Eventually I starting having the same locking up or booting problem that I had with the first unit.  This forced me to unplug and replug the unit on a regular basis to get it to work.  In the end I'd have to do this several times to get it to boot up.  Eventually the unit broke due to the repeated abuse of plugging and unplugging it in & out of my lighter.<br />I got 15 months out of the unit before it broke completely and was unusable.<br />I will buy another FM transmitter, but not this one.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The display works excellent. It displays the band name, song name, and the folder name (Album name). Not only does the unit broadcast the music to my car stereo, but it also sends the track info from the display, right to my car stereo head unit (this only displays if you car stereo has this feature. my 05 Chevy does.).<br />Sound quality is very good.<br />The signal strength is very strong and I do not get any interference.<br />Cons:<br />The shuffle feature repeats the same tracks.<br />I had boot up problems wich increased in frequency over time.<br />Recommendation:<br />In the past I had recommended this to several friends, but eventually it annoyed me to the point of rewriting this review.  I would no longer recommend this particular device for regular use.

B008B3MZNI|5.0|I have been waiting a looooong time for a vintage Supertramp concert to come out...just got done watching this on my home theater...All I can say is if you are a fan of Supertramp this is a MUST have.Their at the top of their game here in &#34;79&#34; .I was most impressed with the video quality,(remember,this is from 1979!) order today,you wont be sorry !
B007712XAU|5.0|The DVD's were new and in great shape.  The DVD's came in a good amount as indicated.  I had no problems with it .
0671449028|4.0|This is one of our two favorite bedtime books. Sandra Boynton, as usual, writes a book that children and adults both enjoy: it walks the through typical going to bed routine of taking a bath and putting on pajamas and brushing teeth... but then \\"when the moon is on the rise / they all go up to exercise.\\" What? Who goes up to exercise after taking a bath, and right before bed? Exercise right before bed is a formula for staying away more energized, not going to sleep!<br /><br />Fortunately, we don't have to imitate the characters to enjoy the book. The really strong point is the way that Boynton controls the sounds and rhythms here: it has such a flow to it that my wife and I both memorized it in short order, and by the end it has such a beautiful swaying lilt: \\"The moon is high, the sea is deep, / They rock, and rock, and rock to sleep.\\"<br /><br />It's not Shakespeare, but it usually does the trick!
B000SEGEKI|4.0|I enjoyed reading \\"The pragmatic programmer\\". It transcends process and discusses the fundamental aspects of software development. The book provides time and \\"buzz-word\\" invariant common-sense observations and tips about the practice. They are presented in a clear and straightforward manner, complete with many examples of actual code and actual tools. And herein lies my criticism. The code and tools are out of date. At this level of detail, they should be brought up to date.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Every episode is as funny as the last, with that little touch of life's lesson at the end. Genious! We also own seasons 1 & 2, which are equally good.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Four babies from four continents followed from pre-birth to toddlerhood.  No dialogue, none is needed.  The cultural differences alone make this a worthwhile viewing.  Highly recommend.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Works great on my mobile devices. Would recommend to busy people that need to get their information on the go. Can't beat the price.
B0030B624E|5.0|This is the last comment/review you get from me. I do not have time to play your minimum word game.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Great app for people who like to get their information on thy run. Works well with my iPod and Kindle Fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|me and my daughter both love it. easy to play and understand. very reliable. have a great time playing together!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I saw this group on a British television show and fell in love with the lead's voice. It has a variety of songs on it that do not all sound alike. I am in my 40s and enjoy it, and my students are in their teens and really like it :)
B005KELW26|5.0|I bought this for my mom for her kindle and she likes it very much. She says that she feels more comfortable using her kindle since this case allows her a better grasp.
0140186395|5.0|I read this in High School, and over 10 years later I can still say it is one of the best books I have ever read. Steinbeck is amazing, and even if you didn't like Of Mice and Men (not my favorite) or The Grapes of Wrath (also not my favorite), you should still try East of Eden, because it is an entirely different kind of book.<br /><br />What else to say -- just read it!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I just wanted to finish the book to be done with the Trilogy.  Little to poor character development throughout the entire series made me care little for the characters.  Only human empathy caused me to care at all.<br />The ending of the whole trilogy really put me in a frame!  Very frustrating.
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Read the book and was totally impressed with the writing. Had to see if the movie followed suit. Great job for both.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is awesome...there are tons of things you can do to make the game even more interesting and fun to play
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Totally engrossing.  Couldn't put it down.  I would recommend it to a bookclub.  There is much to discuss in the story.  I hope that they make a mini-series on TV.
1451650728|5.0|It begins with the Enterprise called in to investigate a mystery: who has stolen B4 and the remaining Soong-type androids from the Daystrom Institute and Commander Bruce Maddox? That picture on the cover of Noonien Soong himself might be a hint, but it couldn't be old \\"Often-Wrong\\" himself, as we saw him die in the TNG episode \\"Brothers,\\" didn't we? The answer is more complicated than you might think, but the story and ride are more compelling and satisfying than I'd anticipated, even with highest of hopes. After a year of iffy Trek fiction and more swings than hits, this one knocks it out of the park, with shocks, twists, humor, horror, and finally, hope. Engage!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|If you like Nicholas Sparks' other books, you won't be disappointed with this one.  I found it a good page-turner, and I like how the chapters are short enough that I always feel like I can read &#34;just one more before bed...&#34;.  Looking forward to seeing the movie now that I've read the book.
B0076NKNLA|5.0|I love Marilyn Monroe and think that she was greatly misunderstood. This film was very respectful and interesting. I definitely recommended it Michelle Williams is perfect in the role!
0385344333|3.0|This one was a bit of an odd departure from the normal Reacher fare, with Reacher getting embroiled in a plan by killers to get by several police checkpoints using a hitchhiker. Unfortunately, they pick up the one guy they wouldn't want to pick up, our favorite butt kicker. There seemed to be a lot of scenes stretched out unnecessarily although it's the same taught dialogue fans are used to. Middle-of-the-road-Reacher.[[ASIN:B007U7WMI4 Quinn Checks In (A Liam Quinn Mystery)]]
B0037QGRZG|4.0|One of my all time favorites! Pat Morita was the ideal choice for the character of the teacher and mentor for Ralph's character!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|started playing this game over 12 months ago and still like it. i like it; husband likes it and five yr old daughter likes it.
6305754969|5.0|The chemistry between Robert Mitchum and John Wayne in this film is outstanding! I was pleasantly surprised to find this film to be as funny as it was!
0061474355|5.0|I can't remember the first time I read this book, but I feel like it's always been a favorite of mine. I love the world of Abhorsen so much. I also love zombies. And magic. And waterfalls. And cats. This book has all of the above. So yeah, I love it.<br /><br />The romance between the two main characters Sabriel and Touchstone may be a little rushed, and kind of has the whole \\"all-the-sudden-we're-madly-in-love\\" thing going on, but I blame it on the fact that the story isn't focused on the love story, so we just don't see them falling in love. Instead, the plot is all about saving the Old Kingdom and Ancelstierre.<br /><br />And Mogget anyone? Best character -ever-. There is nothing like a snarky white furball to make a good book even better.<br /><br />I would really love to read a book set in the same world but a hundred or so years in the future. Lirael and Abhorsen are okay, but really don't do Sabriel justice. Sabriel will always be my favorite.
0449806901|5.0|nolt sure you can find the old jack reacher books in cd format, so these cheap prices are great. i listen in the car.
B002VHI8FE|3.0|I think it is a book for younger people, it has to much descriptions of the fights, I wanted to read them fast to go back to the adventure.
B007HACDLK|3.0|The Vince Flynn series has kept me looking forward to each new book over the years. It is an emotional rush for me with the same effect that children have with the build-up of anticipation,  waiting for Santa Claus.<br />I've read them all, and not just once, probably 4 or 5 times each by now. Even a few on Audio!!!<br />I couldn't wait to start \\"The Last Man', but to my shock and awe,  the first few chapters were pure torture<br />to get through.  Where did Mitch Rapp go?  Who is this new, talkative, silly, emotional Mitch Rapp, please Mr. Flynn, say it ain't so, he is turning into  a \\"Girlie-Man\\" or even worse, a \\"Liberal\\"!!!!  It took me a few days to pick the book back-up again.  Each page was like being \\"water boarded\\" or having the Old Rapp threaten to put a round in my right knee- cap!<br />  The descriptions and dialogue are often just boring.  Even Irene Kennedy has been weakened, of course not as weak or pathetic as the real world DCI, but , none the less, Dr. Kennedy's character has seemed to have weakened. Now almost two weeks from starting the book, I have just about finished. Any of the others, I would be finished with the second reading by now, Of course, I will finish the book, eventually, but it will definitely leave a bad taste in my mouth.  For the next one, I will \\"sample\\" it before I buy it, unlike now, just buying the next book because of the reputation of the author! I sure hope Vince Flynn is not going the way of so many others, by having another \\"author\\" assist him in the writing...it's NEVER EVER the same.  I know he has serve health issues.  I would have rather he dealt with his health first then continue to write about the missions of the Real Mitch Rapp carrying in one hand his renewed NRA membership card and in the other, his GLOCK 17 with his no BS kick butt  attitude!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Please Vince I am praying that you get well and soon!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another Grisham triumph! A very different story from others, but equally thought-out and planned to lead the reader through a maze of twists and turns. The ending was not what I expected. I would definitely recommend to all Grisham fans out there.
B008M87GJK|4.0|this has really interesting stories that always catch your attention. what i really like is that it gets new stories all the time. best news app I've had in a very long time
B0076DELIG|5.0|There are a few characters in detective novels that hit me in that section of the amygdala reserved for \\"pleasurable reading experience/detective novels\\".  Harry Bosch and Elvis Cole are two who get the most space.<br /><br />The Black Box is an excellent story that seems neither too short or too long and has the requisite tension and suspense of a good thriller.  I enjoyed it immensely.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I think Angry Birds Star Wars ROCKS!!!!!! it it even more fun when you get several people huddled around a computer taking turns at beating the levels,all of them making comments and suggestion on how to beat the various levels.I would recommend this to all Star Wars and angry Birds fans.I like the objects that you can blast in the Stage Select screen it doesn't accomplish nothing,but it is still fun,the physics still piss me off,there are times that a shot should have worked but didn't,but i think that is just in the game.Overall a very good game.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|Thanks for the great item at a great price! Item exactly as describe and came a great distance in a very short time.
0345529057|2.0|It was a Christmas gift for my niece i personally don't read the books or watch the tv Show,but she reads the books and watches the tv show avidly.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson should just be hired by other writers to create their magic systems. Everything he does is novel, creative, coherent and shows an approach that is not just based on gimmicks but a conceptual whole.<br /><br />His short fiction will always leaving you wanting more, but at least it is coming out more often!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The newsfeed only displays about a dozen or so updates. When I try to see older posts, it just keeps loading, but nothing happens. Also, it doesn't have a link to my photos. There are definitely some bugs to work out. I've started accessing Facebook from the web, which kind of stinks because it's just the regular web page and the print is tiny. Hope they fix this soon. This seems like a pretty huge oversight. Bummer.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All 3 of the Hunger Games books are terrific.  Almost sorry I finished them so fast.  Great story line and character development. I saw the movie and was entertained, but you just can't compare to the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|suspensful and full of twists.  Liked it so much I bought Sharp Objects by Gillian Flynn after reading this one.
B008J05EL8|3.0|I tried to print a Word document from my tablet, but the format was wrong.  I couldn't use the result.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|very fun and easy to play can start or stop anytime my kids were the ones that told me about this game
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This movie is great! It is fun for the whole family, adults and kids will love it! The moral of the story is really good.
B0000057D8|5.0|To have inspired music this superb Brandenburg must be the home  of a supremely magical and elegant society. The music soothes my tired soul and warms my heart.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What can I say that more than 2000 readers haven't already said? Its likely that the only person that will ever read this review is the author (he did say he reads them all!), there are so many before mine. So I will talk to you, Mr. Hugh Howey!<br />I have to tell you why this book got my attention, and you may laugh, but its the truth. It was the single word, 'Wool'. I am a spinner, I shear sheep, clean the wool and I spin it into yarn. And if you have ever known anyone who spins wool, we are the worst (or maybe the best) types of addicts, we can't get enough wool! So I clicked on it. That's when I saw that the Omnibus had over 2K reviews and still maintained 4.5 stars. I glanced at the book description, didn't really read it, I still don't know what it says, because I LOVE a good book! And with ratings like that, there was only one thought; I knew beyond doubt, that \\"Wool\\" would be a good book.<br />Here I am now, at almost 3AM in the morning, having just finished part 5, and telling myself (after purchasing 6 and 7) that I can't stay up any longer, I have a lot to do tomorrow, I will have to wait to start #6. Its not a very convincing argument, but my eyes are arguing for sleep too...<br />So thank you Mr. Howey, because no matter the genre, I LOVE a GOOD book!
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|It's an awesome movie that everybody must see! It's funny and a movie jewel. I absolutly recomend it. Buy it
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Had this on DVD before and my daughter loaned it and it never came back so I purchased again.  Sot that should tell you I loved it!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Great music to sing and dance to. Train has a great sound. I recommend the entire album if you like a classic rock style in a new age feel. The lyrics are east to hear and repeat - not lost in techno distraction.
B0073L91MW|3.0|I rented the movie because I'm in love with Sean Bean.  I was expecting a more current war.  Still was a good movie, just not great!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Absolutely a must in this year's holiday music and will no doubt be timeless. Buble just has what it takes to relax you. I was listening the first time while cooking Thanksgiving dinner and I felt filled with inspiration for Christmas and that doesn't often happen in November for me!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I use this application all the time.  Provides access to a multitude of sources for talk, sports and music.  Use it to access Dolphins and Gator football broadcasts.  Reliable application that works with ease.
B004HU6YZ4|5.0|My wife and I liked it so much we went and saw them in Charlotte,NC. This album takes me back to the,'Heaven and Hell&#34; era of Social D. Absolutely awesome, &#34;Great Times and Killer Ryhmes&#34; should be the title !!
B005LBF7CY|5.0|Another fantastic Danielle Steele novel - my favourite author can never go wrong!! Great escapism - gets you in from the start! :)
B000V698WE|5.0|Admittedly, like most people who have grown up listening to mainstream music, jazz i not the easiest genre to dive into.  I started listening to Coletrane with My Favorite Things, then onto to Blue Train and Giant Steps, but then tackled A Love Supreme and was amazed by the depth of the album.  Coletrane demonstrates his craft in hi exploration of faith and devotion to something bigger than himself and a sense of humility to the power of a greater power.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Dianna has done it again.  This album covers the classics, but with the distinct voice of the one and only Dianna Krall. I highly recommend this album.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Action packed! Emotional rollercoaster! Lots of zombie killing! If you are a fan if the comics this wont disappoint! Commercial free on amazon Would recommend!
B00005N9CV|5.0|I truly enjoy this album, it covers many of the standards, but is performed by the undeniable talent of Dianna Krall.  I place this at the top of the Dianna Krall albums in my Jazz Collection.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|This is an orgasmic riot of phenomenally raunchy, in-yer-face rough-edged rock, the best I`ve heard in many a long day & many a waning moon.<br />The opener, I Gotsta Get Paid (also the single) is easily the most exciting rock song of the century. It doesn`t let up after that. Rick Rubin & Billy Gibbons have somehow found a sound - gritty, insidious, down & dirty - that suits the Top down to the ground.<br />On not a few tracks they even sound like Captain Beefheart & the Magic Band, and there really can be no higher praise. Billy, Dusty & Frank have found a new lease of life, and I love it to death.<br />Track 4 is a terrific ballad called Over You, sung by Billy with a Bob Seger-like swagger, and the synths(?) come in for a few bars just when you least expect, leaving at least one listener with his heart in his mouth. Then there`s a brief guitar riff that does for that same listener. What a great track!<br />The harmonica on Heartache In Blue is a feisty fandango. As for the guitar throughout: never better.<br />ZZ Top are one of the few essential rock bands still doing their thing, they sound on this showing a lot more on the case than the Stones, and I can`t recommend this brief yet stupendous album too highly. Please ignore the one-star doubters who would have you believe it all sounds the same, or it `doesn`t sound like their early stuff`. Both claims are trash: this is the real thing.<br />Welcome back ZZ, you`re the Top! If this is La Futura, then we`re on the right track.<br />Think I`ll play it again...
B0002NRRAG|5.0|J'aime vraiment cet album. Madeleine Peyroux a une voix inoubliable. Je recommande fortement cet album. J'apprécie particulièrement ces chansons un après-midi paresseux d'automne.
B001E9641K|5.0|The regular Ticket to Ride isn't the best in 2 player, so this is a great version, only for 2-3 player.  I like the addition of the tunnels that add a fun new dimension.  My only problem is my knowledge of Nordic geography needs some work so I spent a lot of time &#34;searching&#34; for routes!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 4 year old just loves this game (he loves Perry) on the Kindle. He can easily play it.  Many of the levels are hard enough to challenge an adult, but honestly my 4 year old rocks it!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great, fun, easy to learn game. My only &#34;complaint&#34; is the acount of &#34;fiddly&#34; bits that this uses, which  makes it hard to play around kids!  It also takes a bit to set up, but once it is set up, this goes quickly!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app with the potential to perform a multitude of tasks. I am looking forward to learning all of the nuances of this app and having it help me be more efficient as I try to wean myself from a paper-filled way of doing things to a paperless method.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great book and very shocking good job!!! I would read it twenty times over if I had to!<br />_
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is fun bcaz I get to play so many game at 1 time and its on 1 app and also its FREE! I love this app
630463949X|5.0|Classic Rock band Fleetwood Mac is the greatest! I love it all! Stevie and Christine can't be beat!<br />I've enjoyed the album for years!
0525953590|5.0|Brilliant book, explains how the world really works. I love this book. The author is a bit arrogant, but rightfully so.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|It was very easy to read and seemed like an episode of Castle in print.<br />Fun book. Will read the next one as well.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have read most of not all of Grisham's books and have enjoyed them. They are usually serious in nature and his visualization of the small towns and their situations, although a bit drawn out at times, is really great.<br /><br />In the Litigators, Grisham for the first time is humorous. He creates a series of quirky characters and brings them to life as he does so well. I have never laughed out loud reading Grisham, but found myself doing this throughout the book.<br /><br />A &#34;fun&#34; Grisham book!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Interesting premise and wonderful execution.<br /><br />Wondered throughout the book where it was going, but was happily amazed at the outcome.
B000TEMRO4|5.0|If your a fan of Blondie don't pass this up, it's her greatest hits, keep in mind Blondie was around way before Madonna and Lady GaGa and I have been her fan for years.
B009439HEY|5.0|Awesome album!!!<br />any  (older) Genesis fan will LOVE it!!!<br />Brings back a lot of memories of way back!!<br />but it!!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Great series, interesting character study of human interaction during a crisis set to a horror movie backdrop.<br />I recommend it
030758836X|3.0|I thought Flynn's characterization of her two primary characters was great. I hated both of them with fervor not felt since Umbridge. Nick is a buffoon and Amy is a manipulative, terrible human being.<br /><br />Part 1 sucked me in and I fretted about Amy's fate and whether I was reading a false narrative on Nick's part. Part 2 shocked me and got my blood boiling throughout as I wanted to reach through and throttle all the characters. But Part 3 left me thinking \\"What? I don't get it. THAT's the ending??\\"<br /><br />It was as though Flynn lost steam. As though she became exhausted and wrote a copout ending. Because of this, I was very disappointed in how it ended, and am giving the book 3 stars overall.
B004YM6JK0|3.0|I've watched Supernatural from the beginning and maybe it's just viewer exhaustion but I felt like I saw most of Season 7 before in the previous seasons. The guys are great, but the story is getting old.
B00005JMYI|5.0|will Farrell is a genius.  Ron Burgundy is one of my favorite characters. I watch this over and over. I wish it were out on blu-ray.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I really liked this book, as it shows operation aspects and human feelings about that. It gives a good idea about the SEAL's life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really like the game but the shop force closes and I cant get into the store to shop. my kids love the game as well...really wish could were able to get into the shop.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Although the movie started off at a pace that was difficult for my little ones to follow, I felt the ending was absolutely spectacular. Very moving. Also, the characters were soooooo wonderfully created - I loved just LOOKING at them, and watching.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I love the game play. but I cant play more then 30-45 seconds before the game crashes. then when I get back in I have to do everything again. then it crashes again.  not happy.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app needs to be updated, please, so that the interface loss more like the movie phone app, and not handicapped.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|James could not have outdone herself any more. She incorporates every tribulation of marriage and love that a normal couple would endure, but adds a Christian Grey twist. The main concept displayed throughout this book, which is not overshadowed by the other two, is the duration of love through all obstacles; ultimately allowing the reader to encompass oneself fully in the book, undisturbed by the surrounding world, as an entirely new, and vivid life is being illustrated by the mind. This ending was unlike any other I've read, regarding the heart. It doesn't leave you hanging in anticipation, but in contentment (just as if the reader were Anastasia Grey, basking in post-orgasmic-Christian-Grey-warmth). I literally had tears in my eyes.
B00659N39K|5.0|It is small.  It is expensive considering the size.  However, it is very well make the soup  container is great.  Does not spill and keeps thing warm for a while.  The small container are a little hard to use for some thing due to shape but they seal tightly and wash well in the microwave.  Overall I like it.
B001GJ3BPU|5.0|Daredevil is a bit darker than your typical superhero movie, such as spiderman or avengers.  But the story is awesome.  And bullseye and Kingpin are super cool villains.  Highly recommended...
1455853941|5.0|I've enjoyed Follett for years.  He tells a magnificent story.  This is a little different. Based on a true story not fiction.  Truth is stranger than fiction.

B004Y1QKKK|3.0|Not a fan of reading plays.  For me, too difficult to read.  But I do like Oscar Wilde's works as watched either on the stage or screen.

B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book has similar plot features to The Firm. I enjoyed it nonetheless, but a bit predictable. I enjoy Grisham's writing style. However, this is one of my least favorite books in his collection.
B0000C1733|4.0|I am an 80s and 90s fan bigtime, so this CD fits perfectly into my musical genre of 90s rock.

B0085RQLXK|5.0|i have not even bought it yet....the bad reviews I see will not stop me. remember...yes they are in their 60's! i am 51 and I tell you..they can still rock! i wish I could do what they do! there music has changed...all old rock stars change. i have seen them many times in concert,,,and they never dissapoint! i will buy it and add it to all the rest of my aerosmith cd's! ..and I have everyone so far!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I would not have wasted my money if I had known how bad it was. There were a lot of good actors, but the story was aweful!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|It had a very good story, about hope. Something that was thought impossible, was possible. It was about what could be done.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another fast-paced page-turner from Vince. I told myself I would make this one last for two weeks, but I was done in a few days like I always am with a Mitch Rapp novel. Great story, with classic characters and some interesting new ones.  Can't wait for the next one!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great for passing the time, wish that the gave investment points alittle more and make goals about facebook less. Worth a try
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved this story, always interesting, fast paced, exciting.<br />Hard to put it down - just had to keep reading....<br />and when finished, want another John Corey adventure!
B007VYDFMS|2.0|I want to say that I love the man's music a great deal. I also wish to say I seriously looked forward to seeing this film. Sound-wise, the b/w film REALLY shouldv'e been remastered and visually cleaned up in spots. Even minor noise reduction anyone has in the house could have and should have easily been done, but wasn't. However, the later, color video; \\"Is this love?\\" came out super-nice acoustically. This is being played on a Samsung HDTV with KRK Rokit 5 power speakers--low-cost, nice, flat response speakers for studio playback.<br /><br />As for that above-mentioned track, the microphone looks to be a Shure 81, which is an odd choice for singing. Normally used as drum overheads. But it sounds well by then. It gives me hope to see a man with a REAL hard upbringing, look so happy. It makes me sad to see him be married and lie about it on tape, and lie to women, enslaving them as his own people were enslaved. There were 11 children with 7 women. I knew this before, so it doesn't color my view of the film. It can't change how I feel about the music, but I'm always looking for a true hero.<br /><br />I can't figure out why he was so intent on a black audience when his father was white. What does that matter? Maybe  it was the white folks who needed his message more, about solidarity.<br /><br />\\"Could you be loved?\\" REALLY needed even minor remastering. I could do it here at home on a limiter/gate worth less than 500.00. However, I realize I'm a snob, much more so than 90 percent of the normal population.<br /><br />I think it could have lost quite a bit of time, personally. He went to bed hungry. Seriously hungry. It could've been cut short, \\"Here's what poverty looks like where Bob grew up.\\" I wanted to see more concert footage, and I REALLY wanted to see subtitles, as the accents are very hard for me to understand, personally. It took me DAYS to understand people when I was IN Jamiaca; great place if you're going somewhere. Each island is a bit different, so I get thrown for days. But I really love it. Nowhere in the world like it, truly.<br /><br />Camera-wise, I'd like to have seen the whole band, and especially the drummer. Not just Bob.<br /><br />I have some old cd's and I had to play with them for noise-reduction purposes, unfortunately.<br /><br />I liked how he mattered so  much to other people. How his music matters so much. How he was able to give hope. No one with an easy life can give you hope.<br /><br />I judge movies based partially on how much I personally am interested in the subject, but a REALLY good movie SHOULD suck you in, even if you hate all other movies on that subject. I hate mafia movies, but I love \\"Casino.\\" That's the only movie like that I can stand. I was never big on the Carpenters until I accidentally caught a documentary on them, and had to see the rest of it. I cried watching it, and I never owned a Carpenters album until after I saw that film. She was a PHENOMENAL drummer that no one knew about. She never played on a hit album, but she SHOULD and COULD have. Easily.<br /><br />Towards the end, talking about his cancer and death, the film gets more of my attention. I don't care about the politics. I don't even care about hearing about cancer. But how it affects him gets very interesting.<br /><br />Sad how so many valuable people are dead of cancer. People who are true lights of the world. Sad how people took advantage of his money; how generous he was. How sad his eyes are in one of his last photos, how scared.<br /><br />The credits end with \\"Three little birds,\\" which never fails to make me tear up. \\"Don't worry, 'bout a thing, 'cuz every little thing's gonna be alright...\\" Hope.

B007PF7MGS|5.0|Dr. McDougall hits it on the head when it comes to which foods are ideal for the human diet. He explains it simply and to the point. He also has 40 plus years actually implementing it in real-life practice with patients with good results year after year. A true clinical opinion based on experience. Forget the dogma and hype of book selling and get to the facts of human nutrition, better yet, simply follow a diet like Dr. McDougall's and the results speak for themselves.
B000000OU0|5.0|Whether you're driving down the road or boogieing in your living room, this CD is a wonderful way to raise your heart rate and send your blood through your veins making you HAPPY!
1608871452|5.0|Even though I own all of the Season Companion books, this one still managed to impart information I hadn't seen.  Most of the pictures are ones I've seen before, but even the most rabid fan will find something new in this book.  The little gifts scattered throughout are nice (although I'm trying very hard to keep it intact so I'm not taking them out).  I can see where you could decorate an entire wall if you took them all out and put them up, which would be fun if I wasn't trying to keep it intact!<br /><br />The book is well made and the pages are heavy glossy stock as a coffee table book should be.  You can tell much work went into it.<br /><br />A must have for any true Supernatural fan!
B007QUOQB6|5.0|Dr. Schwartz passes great tips and approaches through stories that everyone can take and understand. Simple, fast-reading book that can be read as a tutorial for thinking big - at work and life.
B000FC12L4|5.0|Lireal builds on Sabriel without being in the least bit repetitious.  The characters are different, fun, interesting and flawed in ways that are endearing but not in superficial ways that make them empty shells, annoying, or boring (i.e. Bella from Twilight).  Lireal is less horror-gone-light than Sabriel but Death and the evils it harbors are still ever present.  It's really fun to get to know the Clayr and gain a stronger understanding of The Charter which wasn't really expounded upon in Sabriel.<br />I liked that Nix put some time in between the settings of Sabriel and Lireal because it gives more urgency to the tasks at hand whereas if The Old Kingdom were always in a state of life or death peril, it might not be as powerful.<br />I think that the Clayr's library has to be one of my favorite places in any story.  It was the place I always dreamed of living in as a child only better!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Sometimes the middle books in series get lost between the excitement and newness of the first book and the culmination of the overarching plot lines of the last.  This is not one of those middle books.  Suzanne Collins is a masterful storyteller and every element of Catching Fire is genius.  She really understands how people work and her characters are very real in emotion and action.  She's incredibly creative and the details she provides just leave you thirsting for more.  The book has some darker, more mature elements to it so I wouldn't recommend for kids younger than 13 but I may just be old fashioned.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I truly don't know what to say about this book other than I wish I hadn't read it. I truly wish that. Is it a good book or a bad book that make me feel sick and hopeless and helpless all at the same time? Was it a clever ending or a total copout? I'm not sure so I gave it a 3 star review. But in all honesty, I wish I never read this book. And that is not a gimmick to get you to read it. I won't read any more by this author. I can take a bad ending as much as a good ending but I don't read books to be left feeling so totally disturbed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've had some lengthy conversations regarding whether this book was as good as its predecessors or not and I staunchly stand by it.  The criticism I've encountered mostly stems around a desire for a longer, more detailed and drawn out ending.  The fact that there is a desire for more indicates in and of itself that the book is wonderful but I don't think that there is anything wrong with it as written.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS- READ ON AT YOUR OWN RISK<br /><br />I understand completely wanting more details about how Katniss and Peeta rebuild their lives together.  Peeta is a great character and very lovable but this is the story of Katniss, not the story of Katniss and Peeta- although that's a part of her overall story.  Furthermore, this is the story of Katniss and the Capital.  In some ways, iI would argue that it's almost more about Katniss and Snow than Katniss and Peeta.  When there is no more Snow and no more Capital and Katniss starts to move on from that, that's the end of the story and I think that to have spent even a hundred more pages going into more detailed accounts about how things &#34;normalized&#34; would really take away from the main plot line.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I used to enjoy her books a lot, but I didn't this one,  It was so confusing with a lot of plots seemingly going on at once.<br />I thought it a waste of my money
B007B6VOG0|5.0|There's a reason this album and its singles are so popular.  The music is energizing and upbeat.  The band's name is very apt because their music is just fun!  My wife feels like there is some unnecessary auto-tuning because the lead singer has a good voice but it's not a deal breaker and doesn't detract from the album too much.  We listen to this often.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|The book is a little wordy.  The best parts are the beginning and the end. The author uses too many words to make his point.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is a great indie album.  The voices are unique and the songs are pretty well written.  The music is really laid back and chill.  Our daughters (ages 2 and 1) love listening to it in the car.  Our 2 year old especially likes to request &#34;Monster music&#34; and it's a wish I'm happy to grant because I like it too.
0316227706|3.0|I love the pictures; unfortunately, some of the photos are spread over 2 pages and the dog's face is distorted by the book's binding.
B004R63MWQ|5.0|My wife and I laugh whenever movies overuse teal and orange to make their characters stand out more but it works for Tron (less so for Transformers).  We've never seen the original but this was really fun and exciting and a good balance between action and drama.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Good app but HORRIBLE price!! i mean sure for the serious minecraft lovers who r obsessed with this app and game but im just looking to simply play minecraft but for 7$?!? pshtt forget that!
B0092QITO2|1.0|Ok, I loved the Schwarzenegger movie, it was a campy fun SciFi flic, my favorite genre, and I was exited when I heard they'd remake it... But instead of getting our collective asses to Maaas, we go - wait for it - to dreary old future London, which looks pretty much like dreary old present day London if you ask me.<br /><br />Somehow in the future only Britain and Australia remain, with Australia being a colony of Britain connected through an underground tunnel/elevator that can go from one end to the earth to the other in 17 minutes, in a massive elevator like gizmo. Other that that the local are pretty much interchangeable only in Australia the houses hang from the sky, which I guess makes sense because its on the other side of the world.<br /><br />The whole movie is littered with silly references from the original movie which is cute at first, but later serves as a constant reminder of how much better the original was. The whole movie seems to be pieced together from the left overs of other movies, the police robots look like they are lifted straight from Star Wars, the constant rainy dreariness from blade Runner. This movie shares with the original the name, the three breasted hooker and the name of the protagonists and that's it, to call this a remake is just laughable...<br /><br />The equivalent would be to remake Star Trek, but instead of all the cool space ships and stuff you cast Gilbert Gotfried as Captain Kirk driving a school bus through Burbank that's named 'The Enterprise' .... Ugh completly forgettable....
B0091WS2DK|5.0|This is one excellent movie, they don't make them often like this anymore, maybe the new one is \\"Atlas Shrugged\\"  a must see in order to truly understand the idea of personal integrity.<br />This idea of love and integrity versus greed and self-righteousness it is not a popular subject. Our inner conversation reveals to us our weaknesses, on the end only some are able to resist temptation.<br />To really understand this movie one needs to have little familiarity with Ayn Rand's biography, she is from Saint Petersburg, born just before the October Revolution. She revealed in this movie that \\"elevated conciseness\\" exists for its own sake and not as a part of the collective as it was propagandized by the communists.

B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The second season of American Horror Story is just as good, if not better, than the first. I enjoy that the bring back the same actors and actresses but have them play different roles.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is really fun on my kindle fire  but 2 days ago when i went into the shop to buy something it woul say force  close  and it would shut down and go to the kindle fires main screen.  and i really dont want to delete and then reinstall it bcause i have like 222000 coins and it toom a long time to get that.  other than that it is a really fun game.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|Spent two hours to finish this game.  Used the hint a few times.  I like this type of game. Would like to play more!  A lot of fun!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Game play:<br />The game starts by bringing back memories of your grandmother and her stories about being an archeologist.  Her stories based around the discovery of a lost city and its magical powers that the people who lived there had.  She asks you to take her journal and a heart shaped stone that she wants you to return to the city.  Her map will guide you on the adventure of your life.<br /><br />As you move around the entrance you find items lying around that you can collect and find symbols that you make note of in your book.  The graphics are spectacular.  You place the heart stone into the chest of the statue and the season changes to spring.  You randomly find objects in the different locations you go through.  Some you can collect but some you cannot as you have to use one item to free another to add to your collection.<br /><br />Main screen:<br />* Start<br />* Other games - takes you to an add page to show you another game but there is no link to the Web to purchase it.  This is a first for a game and I like it.<br />* Options - reset game, select language and credits<br /><br />What I like:<br />The graphics are spectacular on this game.  This app is beautifully designed and thought out.  I was having so much fun trying to solve the game that I was forgetting to write a review.<br /><br />The puzzle is difficult but fun.  There are hint pages but to be honest I haven't used them as they are labeled as spoilers for a certain area and I would rather solve the puzzle on my own.<br /><br />There is a page to show you another game on the main screen but there is no link to the web.  I like this as your children can go look but not purchase another game with just a few touches of the screen.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />So far I haven't found anything detrimental to the app except that it asks for your device ID in the permissions.  That is probably used to register the game but it can have other detrimental uses.  In this case I like the game so much that I don't care that it is there but I wish there was another way for register games.<br /><br />Summary:<br />I really like this game.  The beautiful graphics and the interesting puzzle make this game entertaining and fun.  Graphics like this are what you purchased a hi-tech device for.  I haven't played all of the game but what I have is interesting and enjoyable.  I give the game 5 stars as it is well thought out and beautifully designed.  I recommend it to you.

B007V5XT1O|5.0|Carrie Underwood has put out a good album with her \\"Blown Away\\".  Everytime I hear her CD, the more I like it.  I am definitely a Carrie Underwood fan.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was a book chosen for our book club and I originally thought it was going to be about a florist picking the perfect flowers for her customers based on the old fashioned meanings of each flower. Which it kind of is, but is more about how damaged children struggle as damaged adults, how well-meaning foster systems are just that, systems. Your heart breaks so many times reading this book about Victoria, growing up in the foster care system, with only one possible adopter, who turns out is as damaged as she is. As the story unfolds, we learn the pieces of the story, and they are painful. Fortunately, it is so well written that you will keep going to the last page.  And then talk about it - find friends to discuss it with!
B0091REZMW|3.0|I think this game is great but I bate having to downlaod the fullness of the game every time I get to a new level. get it I guess.

B001ILFUDC|5.0|Many critics consider Pinocchio the best Disney cartoon feature ever.  Personly,  I like Peter Pan more.  However,  not liking Pinocchio is akin to not liking youself.  The picture quality on this set is unbeatable and the DVD extras are fantastic.  Impossible to give any other DVD a higher recomendation.

B004EWFV9K|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Wallander evolve, change, grow and ultimately age throughout the series.  The case mirrors Wallander the character in this final telling.  His old  relationships have run their course yet life goes on as his granddaughter tells Wallander and Mankell tells his readers.  It is hard to say goodbye to a series as loved as Henning Mankell's Kurt Wallander.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Being huge Zeppelin fan and not being able to be there it makes me feel as though I was there in a way.
0425263916|2.0|I enjoyed the first book and reason I bought second book was to see how it continued but I was very disappointed. Don't get me wrong I am not prude when comes to sex but there was no story line and until the end I actually got disgusted and bored with the sex in this book, I think Sylvia Day took it a bit to far. It wasn't worth the money I spent and I am very hesitant to purchase the third book if it's anything like the 2nd book.
1476719071|1.0|My sister recommended that I read this book, so perhaps I started out with too high of expectations, but this truly may have been one of the worst books I have ever read. I kept hoping and hoping that this book would redeem itself in some way and it never did.  The main relationship in this book is so dysfunctional. There is no over-arching plot apart from this horribly flawed relationship. The main guy, Travis, is a very violent person. He throws so many punches throughout the book that honestly, he should be in jail. You just can't punch someone in a college cafeteria and expect to walk away from it without the cops being called.  The people in this book were just plain mean. It bothered me that the main girl, Abby's, best friend called girl's roommate a b**ch to her face just because it seemed like the thing to say and it gets passed up like it's something normal for people to do. And while I'm not a prude, there was an unhealthy amount of underage drinking in this book. And don't get me started on the emotional and sexual manipulation that was threaded throughout the entire plot. The maturity of the characters described in this book reminded me of middle school. A gallon of milk would go bad faster than a marriage between these two would last.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|What a refreshing, humorous read.  Light but still very entertaining, this book was hard to put down and had many laugh-out-loud moments.

B000O76T8Q|5.0|I'd never seen the extended version of this film until it aired recently on the AMC channel.  Normally, extended versions of a film leave me flat - and thanking the editor for leaving the &#34;fluff&#34; on the cutting-room floor.  This time it was different.  The 28 additional minutes added depth to the film that made it seem more alive.  And, I especially liked the extended ending with the tsunami special effects.  So, I had to own the extended version DVD.<br /><br />On the shipping end, the packing was great and it arrived sooner than I expected.  All in all, this order was everything I'd hoped for.
B00190OHD6|3.0|Although I generally love a well produced &#34;sappy&#34; movie. I had a difficult time with this one. Worth watching...but only once. This movie simply went way too far into hardcore &#34;chick movie&#34; land for most tastes.
076115678X|5.0|A friend loaned this book to me several years ago for myself.  I now have a young curly girl and wanted a refresher.  I like it so much, I recommended it and the Curly Gurl method to several friends.  There is much more information in the book than is found on the few respectable sites online and videos.

1451638450|5.0|Another awesome yarn from Lois!  Couldn't put it down, kept me up VERY late.  It's very engaging,  Bujold continues to spin great stories.  Altho' it wasn't exactly what I would have expected from Ivan Vorpatril it was something we all (I) hoped would happen.  I really liked this story.  Lots of excitement and adventure AND romance (hey, it's Ivan!). Characters are very believable, the plot thickens nicely, and the ending-----well, I'll let you just read it to see. If you are a Bujold fan, it's a must read.

It was written so beautifully....I felt so close to Pi and his family, knew his inner thoughts on faith and God...the visual discriptions of India, the Mosques,Temples, Churches, Pi's home the Zoo, were just stunning...and I felt I was with him out on the Pacific....It was brutal, heartbreaking, beautiful, and I would recommend it highly.
B0025X4OYI|5.0|This was the best of the best during my college days. Every song is a hit. We would sit at the local hangout and wore the jukebox out playing these songs. Glad I can get it and play it in my car as I am out shopping and going to work. Ah, nostalgia!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So fun! Rocommended hy me! Ive been a barony for some time.... yeah so this game is awesome it has nightmare. moon in it. you have to get all the ponies back to ponyville and rebuild it all back. even vinyl scratch and Octavia and some other background char<br />characters
0345803485|1.0|I bought this for my wife who enjoys well written books of suspensful or erotic nature and her comments were, &#34;I don't see what all the hype is about&#34;. &#34;It's very remedial, and too simplistic for me to enjoy&#34;. &#34;The Beauty series blows this book away and I won't be reading any of the other 50 shades trilogy books&#34;. She finished it over the weekend and stated that she couldn't get that wasted time back.
1419705849|5.0|I would just like to say that this was a really good price for the new book in the series and it was hard cover.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is a ton of fun. it's not to easy and some people say that it is stupid just because they're stupid and don't no how to swipe some fruit and unlock knives and backgrounds. I know a 2 year old who always plays this game on my fire.
B00354Y9ZU|5.0|This has probably been one of the top ten most influential books for me and, in terms of business-related books, top five. It is aimed at pushing and encouraging you to become a linchpin (indispensable, necessary, needed, required, etc.) in a company or organization so that no one could really imagine the company or organization without you. To pursue excellence and not simply be a &#34;cog on the wheel&#34; as he says, but to use your mind, use your motivation and desire to become great at what you do.<br /><br />Don't allow your position, your duties, your bosses, your coworkers, your own self and fears, etc., to hold you back from becoming a linchpin! As he writes, &#34;You weren't born to be a cog in the giant industrial machine. You were *trained* to become a cog. There's an alternative available to you. Becoming a linchpin is a stepwise process, a path in which you can develop the attributes that make you indispensable.&#34;<br /><br />As he says later on, &#34;If you want a job where you take intellectual risks all day long, don't be surprised if your insights get you promoted.&#34; This, hopefully, helps indicate the direction of the book in that we are to take risks, not listen to our fears and allow ourselves and others to hold us back. Read it. It will change the way you think about your role in your company, organization, family, group of volunteers, etc. I loved it!
B00A135YUW|5.0|I love Lana Del Rey's music, so I love this EP.  I'm curious why she didn't do a whole album because she has enough good songs on Youtube that either haven't been released, were on her first album that was shelved, or on the Lizzy Grant album she bought back to fill it out nicely.  There are probably 30 Lana Del Rey/Lizzy Grant/May Jailer/Sparkle Jump Rope Queen/etc. songs on youtube that either weren't on \\"Born To Die\\" or \\"Paradise\\". (They are all listed under Lana Del Rey, regardless of what she was going by when she recorded them.)<br /><br />\\"Yayo\\" is listed in the urban dictionary as being cocaine, so I'm guessing that is the underlying theme to what is going on in the song.  \\"Yayo\\" was characterized in a previous review as a re-release, but it actually has been re-done with added music, as was \\"The Lucky Ones\\" on the \\"Born To Die\\" extended edition.  When she sings, \\"You have to take me right now from this dark trailer park\\", it isn't just a fantasy lyric - she did actually live in a trailer park at one time.<br /><br />I like her cover of \\"Blue Velvet\\", I just wish she would have added a refrain in her lovely higher pitch.  I'm guessing the commercial tie-in may have hampered her flexibility, although she did say she was going to sing low more often so people (critics?) would take her more seriously.  Lana, if you are out there, don't change a thing - think Roy Orbison.  He sang high when he wanted to and didn't sound like anyone else either, and he had a pretty good career.<br /><br />\\"Cola\\" and \\"Gods and Monsters\\" are both good songs that have explicit lyrics.  Lana talks dirty but doesn't sound dirty, if you know what I mean.  OK, maybe a little.  In \\"American\\" she not only shows off a little distinctive vocal flexibility I haven't heard in her songs before, but she mentions Bruce Springsteen like she does in one of her other songs.  I don't think it is a coincidence that his breakout album was \\"Born To Run\\" and hers is \\"Born To Die\\".<br /><br />The title of \\"Body Electric\\" comes straight from a Walt Whitman poem \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\", which was written in 1855 before the word \\"electric\\" had entered common usage.  Like much poetry and many song lyrics, I guess it means whatever you want it to mean.  Love the song, and whatever the \\"body electric\\" is, I'm singing it as I write this.<br /><br />\\"Bel Air\\" is just kind of there, but in all fairness, rather than give it a chance I always start the CD over when it comes on to get back to \\"Ride\\", the first single and arguably the best song on the EP.  Much like \\"Video Games\\", I always have the urge to play this song over as soon as it ends.  Keep in mind that the actual song is only part of the \\"Ride\\" experience.  There is an official ten minute video on Youtube in which she provides the prologue and epilogue to the song with music-backed narration.  It really is brilliant.<br /><br />To sum it up, buy this CD if you like Lana Del Rey, or are a fan of contraltos in general, like I am.  If you don't already have \\"Born To Die\\", get \\"Born To Die - Paradise Edition\\" which contains both the extended edition of \\"Born To Die\\" and this EP.f \\"Body Electric\\" comes straight from a Walt Whitman poem \\"I Sing The Body Electric\\", which was written in 1855 before the word \\"electric\\" had entered common usage.

B000UZNSWM|4.0|The author offers incredible detail regarding the defense of South Korea and the subsequent and tragic push north of the 28th parallel.  The only reason I did not rate this with five stars was at times the authors writing style did not suit me.  Specifically, at different times the author digressed into very detailed background regarding some of the people involved just as he was depicting important battles of the war.  Besides that minor nit, the book is filled with amazing portrayal of the leaders, men, and many hero's of this conflict.  One last warning - if you are an admirer of General MacArthur I would not recommend this book since it documents both the brilliance of Inchon and the incredible hubris and pernicious leadership that lead to the deaths of thousands of soldiers and marines.
B00A5052YE|5.0|She killed it! Haven't always been a BIG FAN! But this album definitely has changed my mind.... I can definitely say I'm happy I purchased this album!
B004LWZW24|3.0|wow good f ing start not bad not the best I liked it till half way threw the movie I called what the end was going to be why because they end every movie like shit not f ing surprising any more so stop making everything so damn predictable to the point where i am like I in joy this so how crappy is this going to end.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|news feed doesnt work which means app doesnt work. update please. i guess i need more words to describe that it doesnt work
B00846REIS|5.0|the storyline in the book is great. kept me wanting more. eva amd gideon are an amaing couple in the grand scheme of things. cant wait for thethird one.
B000002MUQ|4.0|I'm not a big Van Hagar fan, but that's not to say there aren't any good songs from that era. I really liked Unlawful Carnival Knowledge, 5150 was ok, and Balance is a pretty good last album with Hagar.<br /><br />My main reason for liking this album so much is that Eddie's guitar sounds awesome and the riffs are just amazing, then again he is EVH, so you shouldn't expect anything less. This album is heavy and just about every song rocks.
B0045HCJGC|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies. nobody tops sylvester stallone in my book. love sandra bullock too. great acting plus it keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. great humor too.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like this game very much, the only problem is that the purchases for diamonds are too much money that might be the reason that I might stop playing this game all together!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|this movie is great if you need a good laugh. special effects are very good as is the storyline. one of a kind and i strongly recommend it for everyone.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|my daughter (4) and I both love playing this game. it's fun and easy for her and just plain addicting for me.
0446580848|2.0|The author has taken a great character in John Corey and turned him into a loudmouth obnoxious smart aleck. I found it difficult to read this book to its conclusion. As a reader and fan of nearly all his previous novels I was surprised at this strange and lackluster effort.
B009PU2SX8|4.0|This is a really great Blues Rock album.  Gary Clark Jr., I can't wait for what you will produce next!
B008YRVW0I|5.0|i didn't expect much from this app, but it's a lot of fun.  Great casual game with built-in rewards!  I also like that it has the capability for multiple profiles.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Just gotta say that with the hundreds of comments from users who are ALL Reporting the SAME problems, it amazes me that the developers even got this app to this point. It would be a pride and responsibility issue for me to &quot;fix it&quot; but if it's not done yet .. no pride.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Addictive.  A great game for solo...or teaming up with my toddler for strategy.  We love this game.  The more rewards / the more addictive.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|The box has a little crack. But other than that it's great. I haven't see all of the discs yet. But there's no problem for the ones I've seen.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this trying to lose some extra baby weight. I almost died the first time. Love this workout.<br />Hard but good. I was very sore the next day and each time i do it i get stronger. Works many areas at once.<br />Would definately recomend.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|From the beginning voiceover the tone of the movie is set, and true to the novel.  Gregory Peck is the quintessential father figure and the children are superb in their roles.  Best movie ever!
B000NI8F5G|5.0|I've seen this movie a few times before but I recently watched it for the first time with my daughter.  It was a very special experience.  The movie is wonderful on so many different levels, including the outstanding dancing and humor, the beautiful sets, and very good acting.  The plot is complex but understandable for a 10 year old.  I love that it was filmed in the 1950's but the story takes place in the 1920's.  The movie incorporates elements of a Renaissance story film production, Vaudeville entertainment, flapper area dancing, and 1950's Modern art and dance.<br />My daughter's comments:  &#34;Donald O'Connor was my favorite actor because of his great tap dancing, humor, and ability to entertain&#34;.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|it only loads a few recent posts and it gets stuck spinning when attemting to view (scroll up) older posts. huge piece of crap!!!

B001T3RA8M|5.0|I was given this book when I was quite young, and I fell completely under its spell on the first read. It is to this day one of my most re-read novels.<br /><br />\\"Sabriel\\" is mature fantasy, in the sense that its characters and settings have a history and logic to them that makes them feel entirely real; it reads more like an alternate history than a fantasy novel, which is by no means a criticism of it. This alternate history is of an early-20th century England which happens to border upon a wild land governed by ancient magic and necromancy. A young girl who attends a boarding school on the civilized side of the wall that divides the two kingdoms is the daughter of a powerful sort of necromancer whose job it is to keep the dead at rest. When he is overcome by a mysterious evil, he sends the tools of his trade, seven magical bells, to his daughter; she must then embark upon a journey across the Wall, and into Death itself, to save him.<br /><br />Nix has created a world so fascinating and poignant that it's difficult to forget. I found myself wanting to know every bit of the lore of Ancelstierre and the Old Kingdom. I memorized the names of the bells and how to ring them, and what effect doing so would have. I fell in love with Sabriel in all her fierceness, strangeness, intelligence, compassion, and curiosity. I fell in love with the love story. I waited for the other books of the trilogy with baited breath, and was never disappointed.<br /><br />In short, I cannot highly enough recommend this book. Nix is a storyteller of the highest calibre, and this is his best work.
034580404X|5.0|I was hesitant to read this but I could't put it down.  I'm on my second round of reading the trilogy!  Love it!

B00571F26Y|4.0|Some friends of mine told me to read this book, because they believe that I am a complete health freak, just because I don't eat meat (I'm pescatarian). I read the book and had to admit that it was very informative. Unfortunately, being pescatarian or vegetarian is not really a good way to start a gluten-free diet. I would not eat anything!<br />I wish the book gave more alternatives for people like me! I would then give it a 5 stars.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I freakin love this game but now i cant open it it keeps force closing.. i keep having to uninstall and install again.. besides that id 5 star it(:
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|If you have not read it already! You must... This was as delectable as the Harry Potter collection. Brilliant, really...
B007Y36K46|1.0|All I can say is we thought our 6 year old son (who is completely obsessed with making up Martian battles) would enjoy this movie. We were reluctant to buy it but, since that was the only option, we did. The 6 year old thought it was boring. So did we. Don't waste your money.

B004LGPBZI|5.0|Everyone who loves straight-up rock 'n roll needs to give \\"DIFFERENT GEAR, STILL SPEEDING\\" a listen; not only Oasis fans.  No longer do these Lads need to \\"Stand On The Shoulders Of Giants\\", they've earned their place to stand amongst them.  Be warned, once \\"DIFFERENT GEAR, STILL SPEEDING\\" is on your CD player, it'll remain there for quite some time...possibly even until BEADY EYE's next release; it's THAT great!!!<br /><br />  When Noel Gallagher quit Oasis in 2009, both brothers formed 2 separate bands.  Noel fronted his with the familiarity of his name.  Liam took the bigger risk naming his, simply, BEADY EYE.  BEADY EYE is all the former Oasis members, except for brother Noel.  The big surprise here is what great songwriters they are: Andy Bell, Gem Archer & especially, Liam.  Chris Sharrock on drums.  (They've learned & honed their songwriting at the knee of one of the Masters, Noel).<br /><br />  There are no \\"fillers\\" on this CD; all great rock tunes.  \\"D.G.S.S.\\" does continue Oasis' tradition of paying homage to their beloved Beatles (Revolver, Magical Mystery Tour & Sgt. Peppers days), but there's so much more retro evoked here, as well: Think Marc Bolan & T. Rex, Ian Hunter & Mott the Hoople, Slade & The New York Dolls - all while still sounding fresh & new!!<br /><br />  Liam's voice has always been \\"Lennon-esque\\", crossed with a sneering, seething growl, but while still far from a purr (except on ballads), the growl has softened.  What is missed is his signature of making 2 syllable words into 3 (i.e. Sun-shine became Sun-she-ine).  But, I don't think the pace, or structure of these songs would support that, and even without it, Liam Gallagher has one of the most recognizable voices in music history.<br /><br />  When Liam sings a ballad (which is usually what he writes) it's a beautiful sound to behold.  It's almost as though he undergoes a metamorphosis; laying his soul bare in the lyrics & his voice softens to truly do them justice.  \\"Kill For A Dream\\" sounds as though it's written to Noel.  Liam's voice (especially on that one) can almost bring a tear to the eye.<br /><br />  I hope BEADY EYE will bring us DVD's of live performances, as well, as the band is not only excellent (in a rock 'n roll starved world), but easy on the eyes, as well!!  I hope, too, at some point on \\"The Long & Winding Road\\" Liam & Noel Gallagher \\"Come Together\\" & \\"Give Peace A Chance\\".  In the meantime, \\"DIFFERENT GEAR, STILL SPEEDING\\" is an exceptional debut, filled with light & energy.  Personal favorites (while it's hard to choose) include \\"The Roller\\", \\"Bring The Light\\", \\"Standing On the Edge Of The Noise\\" & \\"Three-Ring Circus\\".  Fantastic!! NICE ONE, BEADY EYE!!!\\" sounds as though it's written to Noel.  Liam's voice (especially on that one) can almost bring a tear to the eye.<br /><br />  I hope BEADY EYE will bring us DVD's of live performances, as well, as the band is not only excellent (in a rock 'n roll starved world), but easy on the eyes, as well!!

0425263908|3.0|The author borrowed HEAVILY from 50Shades! I was seriously appalled! Some have said the same about 50 Shades and Twilight.  But there is a difference between being inspired by a story line and going in a completely opposite direction with it, and being inspired and write the same EXACT book!  Whoever said these were the authors words, is a lie! How E.L isn't getting a piece of this pie, is beyond me.<br /><br />It's hard for me to judge this story line on it's own merits because it is too similar to 50 Shades.  When I finished reading this book, I reread 50 shades.  I willl say this... Gideon has NOTHING on Christian.  lol.  I can see the story in my mind from 50 Shades.  I can't see this yet with Gideon.  Maybe the second book will help?? I don't know.<br /><br />When I ready 50 Shades of Grey, I immediately downloaded Darker to my Kindle.  I finished reading this book last week and I've been debating on whether buying the 2nd book is worth it.  We shall see!

030758836X|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book, but two friends who are avid readers recommended it to me.  The two opposing perspectives keep the reader coming back for more.  Only put the book down because I have to go to work!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Two of my favorite actors - Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig - are in one movie.  How cool is that!!  It's a great movie to watch when you just want to leave reality for a while.
B007SGM084|5.0|Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.  The story centers on all aspects of making a relationship work, no matter how different each one is, teaches compromise, and real love.  The provocativeness is exciting, but if you look beyond that, story is riveting.  Can't wait for more from this author!!
B002U0KHMY|3.0|I am lazy about watching the DVDs I purchase, so I have not yet watched the DVDs in this season of White Collar, partly because of the Neal/Kate thing.  I don't enjoy that kind of thing because I feel it interrupts the plot.  I am very plot- and action- driven in what I read and watch.  I want to get past it and enjoy Neal Caffrey as I enjoyed him in the fourth season, which is the only season of White Collar that I have seen.  Instant addiction!!  I plan to purchase every season of this show as it is issued on DVD.  BTW, Matt Bomer should be the only choice to play Christian Grey in that movie!
B0073LWEXK|1.0|As I said in title it reverts back to start screen at second page. Something wrong with this. I am deleting. I have new Kindle Fire HD 32 Very disappointed. I like these types of games. I will try again if it gets fixed or someone tells me how to make it work. UPDATE! It loaded and worked on my smaller original Kindle. No instruction don't know what to do. Will read the reviews that help with playing.

B003GIW8JE|4.0|Memorable vintage rock.  Early Prog rock similar to Yes and other super bands of the era. Brings back memories of where I was and what I was doing back then.
0345803493|5.0|I liked the story line very much.  Maybe too much sex.  Does everyone have sex this much?  I sure misses a lot in my life if they do.  My partner would not read any of the series, tho my brother-in-law did and enjoyed them.My partner thought they were porno but I looked them from a different angle.  They are only fiction or are they?  If you can't read a book with the main people getting it on in every page or so it is not a book for you. I did a lot of skipping pages.
B001TMA5VW|4.0|I like the bigger version of the cards because you can see the symbols clearly.  I also love the vivid colors and the muted pastels.  This deck goes hand in hand  with \\"The Tarot Handbook\\" by Angeles Arrien for interpretation.  (I threw out the pamphlet that came with this deck along time ago; it didn't seem that accurate or useful.)<br /><br />I only use these cards for personal self discovery as I've found these to be an accurate reflection of what's going on internally, subconsciously and sometimes in my surroundings.  I haven't used them with others as of yet, and I probably never will.  They seem more sacred to me than average oracle or tarot cards.<br /><br />Also, I tried working with the smaller deck; it just wasn't the same.  I ended up \\"gifting\\" that deck.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|Nostalgically sophisticated British humour that's quite ageless and absolutely priceless. Intelligently ridiculous! Gives a good and funny insight into the British psyche - a study of human foibles, idiosyncrasies and eccentricities. Simply brilliant!
0385535147|5.0|My husband and I found this to be a great work by Grisham..  We always enjoy his books, but this one kept us guessing and what we discussed would be the outcome, was not.  I would recommend this book to anyone who loves mysteries.  I would actually read it again, as there were so many characters that we occasionally lost track.  The holidays interrupted our reading and we had to review past chapters to remember who was who.  overall a great book.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|ES FE is excellent explorer, you need it in fire hd. Installation of third party apps, managing of files, etc. - it is very useful and helpful.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Conan Doyle's master sleuth is back in action, and Robert Downey Jr., assisted every step of the way by Jude Law's Watson, is on the case as Holmes, tracking an elusive occultist criminal around, over, and under London.  Meanwhile, deep in the shadows, a more devious character lurks, controlling the puppet strings.<br /><br />This is definitely an exciting film, and brings new life to the classic detective stories.  Holmes' boxing skills, so often overlooked in the more &#34;bookish&#34; interpretations of him, are clearly present, while Watson's role of protector and foil is quite solid.  Remember, this is an adventure film, not a quiet evening read at home.  All the trapping of a modern adventure are present - guns, explosions, chases, the beautiful femme fatale (Rachel McAdams as Irene Adler), the conclusion ripe for a sequel - and each character is engaging in their own way.  If you like Robert Downey Jr., you will love this movie.  If you like Sherlock Holmes stories, you will like this movie, and probably love it.  Brush up on &#34;A Scandal in Bohemia&#34; before you see the movie, and you will appreciate it more.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who appreciates a rousing film with excellent music.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|If your a guitar head this cd is right up your alley!! This album capture's the Duane and Barry era brothers at there prime all working together like a well oiled machine.. Thank goodness for this great music!!
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|This is a really great &#34;teen&#34; movie.  It's a fun watch, and  has a moral to the story.  This was the first time I had seen Emma Stone, she is awesome in this movie!
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|We were so upset at the awful language in this movie.  The story line was so predictable and the vocabulary was that of a  bunch of 16 year old boys that it was just shameful.  We did not even finish the movie.  I only wish they had a rating of negative stars.  We would have rated it negative 5.  So bad it is going in the trash, where it belongs.
B00000DF6O|5.0|B.B. King hit the mark with this release. Great tunes put together in a very fluid manner.  I can honestly say there is not one bad or filler track on this CD.
B002DD67XG|5.0|JT was one of those singers you used to sing along with on the radio and always played at parties when dancing with the girls. Brings back nice memories and always something nice to listen to
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|love this game, very hard to put down. really like the variety of puzzle types in the storyline and can't wait to play the follow up
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was one I did not expect.  I had tried to imagine the final outcome the closer to the final chapters I got.  Twists and turns throughout every page.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|All of a sudden my Samsung Galaxy 10.1 keeps giving a force close error and I can't resume reading my books! I can always upload them to my HTC phone but I would rather have the larger screen...am I alone in this? The app seems to be working flawlessly on my phone...I normally love this app as it allows me to read all of my favorite books without having to make more room(impossible lol) for books in my apartment.  I can read in the dark and not ruin my eyes as well...well I should say I USED to be able to do these things. I HOPE they fix this issue quick! Could have been a 5 star review before I began having this issue on my preferred mobile device
0316227706|5.0|I am still enjoying this book. It's one you can look at over and over and still laugh out loud.  hope he does many more. It's priceless
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|We decided to view this video before buying it. It is not worth buying to us. We view many animated movies and buy for ourselves or one of our families. We feel this video would not hold the interest of any child we know.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 2 engages the viewer in the lives of the upper and lower classes in Britian. In each episode, we are drawn deeper into the story and no one watching ever wants it to end.  With every character, I want to know more about their backgrounds, how they came to be at Downton Abbey and what their future holds.  It is just fascinating to watch with a history lesson to boot. As always, Maggie Smith is wonderful to watch as are every one of the actors and actrtesses who are involved in Downton Abbey. Just can't wait until next season starts!!!
1401225756|4.0|Completely new take on other dimensions and worlds.  Gaiman shows a fun and dark way to see the unknown Dreamworld.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Colin Firth is one of my favorite actors ever since I watched him in Pride and Prejudice as Mr. Darcy.  He deserved the Oscar for his performance as the Prince who took over after his brother abdicated the throne.  Geoffrey Rush was superb as the speech coach.  The movie is wonderful, uplifting and based on historical fact which makes it even more fascinating.
0375714839|4.0|Another view towards a major revolution.  Shows the U.S. it is not just us in this world, and all those other countries deserve their own respect.

0670023329|5.0|This book gripped me from the very beginning and I couldn't put it down. Shows worst of humanity but also has redemption for the main subject of the book.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show.Nothing like it and it is so different than anything on tv.Lots of action and drama.Not suitable for children.
B006M7JCC2|4.0|A wonderful and inspirational story. It redefines self and gives meaning to death. I read it to my son as he was suffering from incurable cancer. It gave us both new perspective on life, death and dying.
B000TERK14|5.0|Never heard of them until my son played one of their songs on his phone.I am in my 40's and have never cared for alternative muusic but I like this band.The lead singer is Jared Leto who played Jordan on My So Called Life.
B004ZCUFPY|4.0|Fast Five adds an interesting twist to the Fast & Furious franchise, leaning more towards heist flick than a street racing film. Universal Studios has breathed new life into the series by switching up the formula, and Fast Five won't disappoint action junkies.<br /><br />Fast Five reunites Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) with cop-turned-racer Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Diesel reprises his role of Toretto, this time on the run from a high-octane federal law enforcement team led by Luke Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson.<br /><br />Complicating their situation further is Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes, portrayed by veteran actor Joaquim de Almeida of \\"Desperado\\" fame. The only way to dig themselves out of their hole is to pull off a final caper to the tune of $100 million, aided by a variety of former series characters.<br /><br />What makes the latest addition to the Fast & Furious franchise a success is the amount of adrenaline injected into the film. Fast Five is chock full of tense moments, fast cars and shootouts. Adding a bit of levity to an otherwise hardcore action flick are the duo of reggaeton artists Don Omar and Tego Calderon, who return to the series with comedic relief in tow. Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, and Matt Schulze also reprise their roles to offer a sense of familiarity to viewers.<br /><br />Fast Five's musical score is a mix of high-energy tracks with greater variety than other soundtracks from the franchise. The film's score doesn't feature as much American rap as earlier films, though it makes up for it with the inclusion of urban Portuguese-language songs from Brazil. International music ranges from Rio's rap to Brazilian Funk, plus the infectious \\"Danza Kuduro\\" by Puerto Rican reggaetonero Dom Omar, who returns to the film as the pessimistic Rico. Fast Five is the third film of the franchise that composer Brian Tyler contributes to, with songs ranging from cinematic to industrial rock.<br /><br />There are two elements of the film that stand out. The first being the too-good-to-be-true clash between Dom and federal strike team leader Luke Hobbs. The two reaching their inevitable on-screen collision hits with the force of a scud missile soaked in testosterone.<br /><br />The other element is the final car chase of the film. Gone are the intricate CGI shots of the mechanical workings of the cars involved. But what Fast Five loses in computer imaging, it makes up for with hardcore driving. The ultimate chase scene in the movie is far from what you've seen in other heist flicks, and is sure to please even the pickiest of action junkies.<br /><br />That's not to say that Fast Five is Oscar-quality, of course. To truly enjoy this film, you have accept in advance that this isn't Shawshank Redemption. While much of the cast have experience in film and television, the majority serve up average acting at best. I'm a huge fan of Vin Diesel's movies (Pitch Black FTW), but he looks all of his 44 years in this film, and his acting ability hasn't improved much. While he and Paul Walker both are well-suited for action flicks, don't expect profound performances from either of them. Diesel is given more of an opportunity to flex his acting chops in Fast Five, with it's emphasis on relationships and heartbreak, but I honestly wasn't too moved.<br /><br />Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson carries the greatest screen presence of the entire cast, giving off an air of intensity that resonates throughout every scene. But that being said, he wasn't given an opportunity to show off any real range of emotions in the film.<br /><br />Despite Fast Five having it's fair share of action and suspense, the film does drag on a bit longer than necessary with it's runtime of two-plus hours. While the film's conclusion is fairly clear, it's also given an open-ending that paves the way for the franchise's sixth effort, and the possible return of a significant character from the series.<br /><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general. If you're a motor head, you might be a bit let down at the abandonment of the franchise's original formula, though the change still make for a welcome spin on the series. Definitely get the Steelbook Blu-Ray to own one of the better movies in the series.><br />Overall, Fast Five is simply a fun watch, a guilty pleasure if you're a fan of heist flicks or action movies in general.

B00AE2J5HI|3.0|Interesting movie on prohibition , shows you how hard it was to live in certain areas of the country during the early 1900,s ,and to what lenghts the goverment would go to destroy someones lively hood,this movie is worth a look!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rich prose and trope-aware plotting makes this otherwise well-worn story an interesting and engrossing investment. I happily recommend it to anyone.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great show. I have watched since the beginning and have not been let down yet. I can't wait to explore the graphic novels.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|What a wonderful, adventure movie with some of the greatest actors of our time. Very entertaining - moving, funny, sad; an invitation to the East Indian culture!

B0090X4GJE|5.0|Seems like the producers are adding to Ellie's sound and making it more interesting. This album seems to be more deverse and complex than the last. This one sounds less like chick music and is something that both my girlfriend and i can both listen to.
6304698623|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out, bought it again recently, and wow, the magic is still there. I always feel like a princess when I watch this movie. Pure happiness.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is one of the best solitaire games on the apps market.  Easy,  clean, colorful, and very responsive. You can play for hours.
B004UIOUHC|1.0|I called my bank because I couldn't get my bank statement to pull up. They suggested downloading Opera Mobile Web Browser. After I downloaded it, my computer shut down.  I uninstalled it and my computer works fine. It just wasn't compatible with my laptop.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|So I has this proc and a halfway decent mobo with a gtx 570 hd, 12gb ram, and just a 2tb sata...nothing crazy. I installed battlefield 3 and put the settings to max after putting the cpu at 3.7ghz with a nice cooler master after market heatsink and this system handled everything we'll. Of course it helped that I got a haf-x 92 case with ample fans but the point is it works well. I was able to run bf3 at almost completely ultra with a movie on the second monitor @1080p 42\\"...and all my other games. It really served its purpose for multi processing. I loved being able time install stuff and play a different game. Of course it helped the hard drive was enterprise class but regardless, it's a good value if you plan to multitask quite a bit.
B007V65R54|5.0|Such a great read for anyone interested in how to interpret data.  It drives home our complicated it is to really make accurate inferences about data.
1616614609|5.0|I've had this game for about a week now, and me and my roommate cannot stop playing.  We just now switched up our decks as the first decks we picked provided so much variation to play by themselves.  If you like games where you have to play and read your opponent, you will love this.  Its going to  get wild once we start taking advantage of customizing our decks.  If you ever bought trading card games in  your past life you should get this game.  I love the LCG model as I won't have to buy booster packs and I can always change my game up when new cards come out each month. It's on sale right now, but even if it was double that price you should buy it.<br /><br />Note: it isn't the quickest game to learn, it will take a few games to get the rules down, but once you do it opens up so many possibilities.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|having played Grisly Manor and liking it I wanted to try this 1 but I  wanted to wait until it was the free app of the day sure enough here it is thank you Amazon this is a good game if you like games like this highly recommend what more can you ask for it's free!!!

B005K17RU0|5.0|This has everything I want from an app like this. Live radar, weather updates, severe weather notifications, etc....I can also save other locations. I use this on the Kindle Fire and it works great!
0062073494|5.0|This mystery is enthralling! It is beautifully written and so chillingly descriptive. The plot is not transparent or predictable, yet you feel drawn in and convinced that one person in particular is the murderer. A fine classic for readers of any age.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Honestly, the book is AWESOME.  I don't know the author personally, so I'm not just trying to help out a friend.  Very well written, funny, and thoroughly engrossing.  Shoulda charged more for the book!  I could definiely see a movie from this.  Good job, Mr. Weir.
074322454X|5.0|Why waste your time reading reviews? This book is great! Buy now! You won't regret it! These stories are the best thing that has happened to modern literature.

B009VB7QQA|4.0|Pretty cool.  I'm not one for vampire movies but this was definitely interesting.  Unique mix of real history and fixtion.  Good if your in the mood for something different.
B00421IR5I|5.0|This movie had us laughing from beginning to end. The children in it are all exceptional actors and the writer is brilliant in his writing and humor. It is the perfect movie for whole family viewing too as there is no nudity, sex nor bad language. I was a little nervous buying this for so much $ but I'm so glad I did. Highly recommended!
B002SAUCBC|5.0|A long walk is a great book! I would recommend EVERYONE to read this book. When Stephen King writes as Richard B. the writing I observe is darker. I enjoyed this book and I even cried when one of the walkers was killed. I wont give it away but I cried hard wonderful book it rips into your emotions.
B0014J8D9Q|3.0|The movie was great, buts the audio was terrible. Certainly needed subtitles on this one to really follow the story.
B00406UK7S|5.0|this is a sleeper hit! a great underated movie that will become a classic.Good directing , good cast, and well writen.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I could not wait for this dvd; Led Zeppelin is my all-time favorite band, so this is not an unbiased review.<br /><br />I thought it was great! I was pleasantly surprised at how great it was.  I had heard reviews of this concert at the time as being much less than great, that they were unsure of themselves, that they stumbled along for a while huddling together during the show until they got their hard rock groove on. But what I saw was a band that started great and got greater as they got more comfortable, Until at the end of this show they were once again the greatest rock-n-roll band ever. From the beginning they were tight and they only got tighter as the progressed. From the start they were clearly enjoying themselves and that only became more apparent as the concert progressed. One of the things that made LZ great was their musicianship, but what I believe made them greater than just collaborating musicians was their chemistry.<br /><br />The whole point of any need of a reunion is that John Bonham died and the band had to dissolve at that time, and I think the whole point of any reunion is Jason Bohnam, John’s child, and the band’s grandchild, because without him there is no “reunion” concert, no chemistry. Clearly he had that chemistry with the surviving members. I was so struck at how they took so much easy effort to include him as part of the band. He sings backup on the very first song, and Robert introduces him as featured on a later song. All during the show Jimmy, Robert, and John can be seen looking to him and smiling. They seem so happy for him that it’s almost secondary how happy they are for themselves to be playing as a band again. Besides those images, my evidence is that Robert says they are doing this for Ahmet Ertegun and Jason.<br /><br />This doesn’t mean Jason actually replaces his father; no one can do that. Jason is a terrific drummer, and I can imagine no one but him ever playing drums with all the other members of Led Zeppelin, but while he may be the most able replacement, he his still not his father. Bonzo had a certain something that cannot be replaced, and I kept thinking of what was missing for the first two thirds of the concert, but I finally realized that Jason brought his own particular style to his dad’s drumming on all those songs, and he was damn good at it!<br /><br />Oh yeah, Jimmy was awesome, some of the best live guitar he’s ever done. And Robert’s voice is better than ever. JPJ is a wonderful musician that is the invisible glue that makes the band work, though he doesn’t supply the “magic” that Bonzo did. Anyway, my major point is that there is a four-way magic recreated for a brief time that is so very much worth watching. They bring freshness to the songs and expertise that cannot be found in any tribute band.
0385523394|1.0|I regrettably must agree with the one and two-star reviews about this book.  This coddled author didn't really do &#34;hard time&#34;. She was in a minimum security prison that had strict rules, but nothing truly onerous given the circumstances.  Her sentence was a joke because her high-priced lawyer got her a good deal. She had a huge support network of family and friends who constantly visited and sent her money and things to make her very comfortable. Heck, when the author felt claustrophobic, she would run laps on the prison quarter-mile track while surrounded by fragrant trees and woodland animals!  This is prison????  Other reviewers here are correct: it's the penniless minorities with indifferent public defenders and no family support who do the hard time, not this perky, decadent bisexual blonde from Smith College. This book?  It's little better than a summer camp diary.  Near the end of her sentence, the author had to testify against her co-defendants. While awaiting her court appearance, she had to spend some time in a much higher security prison. Prisons where one is fed dreadful processed food, and one rarely sees the sun or breathes fresh air. In that short time, the author was almost driven mad. That's real prison.....but you won't find much of it in this book.
B0092C2X7U|4.0|This is a fun game, but you have to work at it to unlock the levels. That is the whole reason behind the game...to be challenged. Hit free play on any level and then tap five times on the screen for some real fun!!!!
B009ESIGHI|5.0|As a true fan of Disney's muppets, this is a great addition to anyone's Christmas library.  It is colorful, cute and happy.  The muppets do a wonderful version of A Christmas Carol.  Definitely will become an annual classic Christmas story!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|awesome game. interesting and challenging but not impossible. great storyline and really good graphics. really great length and definitely worth the money
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I love Nelson DeMille and I think I have read all his books including the Corey series.<br /><br />This book covers over 600 pages on an iPad. Probably 300 of them involve Corey repeating the plot line over and over and over and over again.<br /><br />I think if you read the first few chapters and the last five you get the full story without all the filler thrown in.
0307352145|1.0|This subject had great possibilities, unfortunately the author wrote it as her personal history, bragging about famous people she'd met and her personal research...I found the book completely useless and the author annoying.  Complete waste of my time and money...it was boring and poorly written and didn't offer any helpful information.
B008ROH07W|5.0|Alison Balsom has come out with another wonderfully fine recording.  Sound the Trumpet features music of Purcell and Handel in arrangements by Ms. Balsom and Trevor Pinnock.  This is the first of her recordings that involve a collaboration with the English Consort under the direction of Trevor Pinnock. I hope that this collaboration results in several more recordings of the baroque repertoire like this one.  The performance is all on period instruments, including Ms. Balsom on natural trumpets.  Despite not having a valved instrument, the intonation is impeccable and stylistically elegant.  Ms. Balsom's playing sounds effortless, when in fact what she is performing is barely possible.  Buy the album, put it on and feel regal.
B002GYKU30|5.0|Back in Black is arguably one of AC/DC's best albums, in fact one of the best albums ever made in the modern history. This collector's edition of Back in Black is both valuable and unique due to it's limited quantities and an exclusive back in black t-shirt. I like the metal case and the shirt very much, but slightly dislike the album in the box as it contains exactly the same materials as other back in black cd edition. A limited collector's edition should always include some bonus materials like tracks and booklet that standard editions don't have. But overall, it is still worth the money and I would recommend this any hard rock fans.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Steven King never fails to make one believe the unbelievable.30 years have passed, and I'm still sucked in to every story.
B001HN697M|5.0|Underworld: Rise of the Lycans takes the audience to the precedent events of the war between lycans and vampires. The story contains a much deeper story of the origination of the two species and the history of their relationship that gradually sees the inevitability of conflicts between the two for dominant status.<br />It is a relatively enjoyable movies. A great item add to your dvd collection of Underworld
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I have always liked the Alien movies, or anything by Ridley Scott. This one leaves you wondering! And although a little creepy, I am compelled to watch it over and over to see certain scenes that were very calculated.
B00328G4XY|5.0|Electric Ladyland sees the different musical exploration Jimi had experienced with. This album contains lots of psychedelic improvisations from Jimi Hendrix. Arguably this is his best album released during his short-lived career. This is an authorized Hendrix Family Edition that includes an exclusive dvd and a booklet with hand-written lyrics, song names, and photos. An absolute collector's must have item for any rock and roll lovers.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|I love the Batman movies, but this one was a little long and had some holes in the plot. I hope the JLA movies are good. DC needs another winning franchise!
B008O6A6T2|5.0|We are the Others is arguably another masterpiece by this underrated symphonic metal Delain. Most songs on the album contain the signature sound of Delain which is both melodic and catchy. I personally admire the evolution of Charlotte's vocal in this album. This album contains her most natural and coercive vocals compare with their two previous albums. I would highly recommend this to any symphonic metal lovers out there.
B008BIN9EW|5.0|Not enough games like this on android. Fun turn-based strategy game. To install it I had to unmount my sd card first. Galaxy S2
B0070W75KO|5.0|Requiem for the Indifferent continues to see the evolving of the band's sound in the symphonic metal genre. This album contains more orchestral parts than their usual album, but simply heavy in tone as their previous Design Your Universe album. Most songs are relatively catchy and appealing to the ears, but certainly they could've done more musical experiments to conceive an album with drastic musical evolution in spite of still attaching to their metal genre.<br />Overall the album is still a quality work from the band. For sure a must own item for Epica's fan.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Can't wait for the next installment. Ms. Day does a wonderful job drawing you into a passionate and psychologically unstable love story. Love is so unpredictable and this story does a wonderful job showing you how so. Loved it!
B004JK61K0|1.0|Every other email client I have can connect to my exchange server.  Not this one.  Even spent 30 mins on the phone with my email provider trying different settings.  Never could get my mail.  I want my money back!  Oh wait...the app is free.  Good thing, that's about what it's worth.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|Love her!!!!!!!! This plays great adel is awesome I can't wait to hear more from her she is one of the best
1593975457|5.0|I read this many years ago as text, and love Christopher Timothy's reading of the series.  It is wonderful!  I am looking forward to the next CD.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|This was a disappointment from the moment I opened the box. Inside parts are all cheap plastic. Doesn't even play cassettes, let alone the rest. Complete waste of money. Very frustrating.
1559277734|5.0|What a wonderful book!  I read this many years ago, and Christopher Timothy is a wonderful reader.  I saw the series on PBS, and listening to it is a real treat.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Love playing Angry Birds and trying to outsmart the pigs. Great stress reliever. Loaded on to my Kindle so I have a bigger screen view.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I loaned my original copy to my dentist who took a cruise to Alaska last year and saw where McCandless was stranded.  This is a replacement copy that I will be using in my classroom as part of our Transcendentalist Unit.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I loved it. It sticks to the original story and is pure fantasy but with a realistic feel.  I was impressed with the actress who played Snow White too. I hated the twilight series and that was all i ever saw her in so I was worried about her skills but she proved me wrong.  And Charlize is outstanding as always. The cinematography is spectacular and special effects nice too. This is a great movie to each if you e joy fantasy a d want to escape for a short while. I usually can't watch a movie twice in a row but I did this one because I loved the haunted Forest scenes and the fungus that sprays hallucinogenic spores... Very nice and good explanation for having those nightmare visions in the &#34;haunted forest&#34;
B008SM0EHG|3.0|I was unaware that this was a children's book when I bought it.  Don't get me wrong:  It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  It's bit sophisticated for my 8 year old granddaughter and a bit young for my high school students.  I guess I'll wait until my granddaughter is a bit older to share it.
8862931921|5.0|Great nnotebook for illustrators, artists and graphic designers. Lays flat for scanning but lives happily in bag or iPad case.
0765316994|5.0|Quite honestly, John Scalzi never disappoints. Each and every time he publishes a book, I'll be among his many fans to get it as soon as possible.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|Came just in time.  I find all the different types of movies kind of confusing.  Thanks for stating it is a DVD.
B005PWPUW6|5.0|My Sony home theater system is over 10 years old and it don't have fiber optic input.<br />This was perfect for my TV in my room because LG is STUPID enough to take out RCA Sound output on new 3D TV.<br />I just plug it in and it was good to go. I don't know anything about 192/24 mode, DAC, or PCM whatever.<br />So I'm very happy that it works great in first try in this installation.(no clicking sound or other no noise)<br /><br />Pro: Low price<br />Well built and clean sound.<br /><br />Con: not yet.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|I've never seen the Christmas carol before, good graphics, fun movie! Teaches the spirit of Christmas! Good job Disney :-)
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This movie has something for everyone, a great classic that will entertain from 2 years old to 90 years old!
B0034G4P80|5.0|Based on a comic book hero, and mythology, you know going in you aren't going to get Hamlet.  This movie delivers exactly what it should, entertainment.  There is a surprisingly good story and a good cast of actors to bring it to life.  The characters are well developed and given a point of view that is easy to follow.  There's balance between the supporting and lead characters that is refreshing.  Chris Hemsworth earned the hype he's being given in this movie.<br /><br /> While banished from his homeworld and made human, the demi-god takes a journey from arrogant boy to humbled man and we get to take that journey with him.  There is plenty of CGI action, some tongue in cheek humor and even a bit of a love story.  I love movies that are just pure fun and entertaining, and this movie is just that.  I bought the DVD to watch the movie over again, and loved it just as much the second time!
B001NLL0RW|5.0|The sigma force series is becomming one of my favorites.  If you are a fan of Clive Cussler novels, then you will love James Rollins.  I'd recommend starting at the beginning of the series as the characters evovle through the books.
B007UXSPK2|2.0|This movie accomplished one impossible mission, which was to ruin the franchise.  It came across as if someone's vision of the movie was conflicted from the very start, because the movie itself was all over the place.  Tom Cruise gave a lackluster performance as super spy Ethan Hunt, but his entire crew for this movie seemed inept.  With the exception of Jeremy Renner as William Brandt who's performance was outstanding, the rest of the team appeared to be miscast in their roles.  Michael Nyqvist, of the original Dragon Tatoo movies was also gave a very good performance as Kurt Hendricks.<br /><br />The story itself presented as a comedy of errors more than anything.  Not even close to what I expected from the Mission Impossible movies.  While diehard Cruise fans will probably enjoy it, I wouldn't recommend it.
B007GCY8FS|1.0|All that was said prior to me is spot on... this was a terrible read, I had to keep reading because I couldn't believe Lee Child would write something this bad!!! I was a huge fan of all other Reacher books and have read the entire series. 61 hours was a little brutal with all the ice under foot, this time it was car under butt. Tom Cruise as jack Reacher, give me a break!!! Was Danny Devito busy so you second out for Cruise?<br />Jack Reacher is 6'5\\" stud!!! Tom cruise can barely see over a steering wheel.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This movie was so good, I had to go back and watch all the movies for the individual characters again!  Plus, I ordered all  the DVD's from Amazon for my collection.  It was just pure entertainment, with fun characters, action and fantastic graphics.  I had never read the comic books, but I didn't feel I had to in order to follow the story.  Joss Whedon was the perfect choice to direct this movie and to help develop the story.  His other ventures, especially with Serenity and Firefly, are good examples of his style and he brought that feel to this movie too.  You cannot beat the cast of the movie; Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johannson and of course, Samuel L. Jackson.  Each and every one of this cast portrayed their characters so well that I almost believe there is a Captain America and Iron Man out there somewhere!<br /><br />The story flows so smoothly that I didn't even think about the premise of good guys vs bad guys.  There just wasn't time for that because the dialogue was engrossing and the fights were exciting.  I also liked the humor, even if some of it was a little too obvious.  This is just a good movie and if you don't see it somewhere, you will be missing out on some fun.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My children and I enjoy playing this game. It's very close to the tv show. It's very easy to collect coins not the gems that you use to speed things along. So far I haven't used any money and I'm currently on level 11.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This is my second Blake Crouch book and I thought it was great. From the beginning, there is this underlying feeling of suspense that kept me interested in the story. I liked it because it made me think about what I would do if stranded in a strange town, with no money or cell phone. The story unfolds at a nice pace, I couldn't put it down.  Without giving away the ending, I will say that this was my kind of book, with mystery, suspense, and some science fiction thrown in. By the way, the other Crouch book I read was Run. It was great too, had me on the edge of my seat and my heart racing until the end.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app and use it across all my devices!  I always have my nites or shopping lists no matter which device I might have with me.  Never have to curse the forgotten shopping list again!  Evernote never forgets!  ***** Five stars for sure.
1451696191|2.0|I don't like this book. It's character development, and though written well with strong characters, prevalent lessons, and memorable quotes, I didn't like this. I own it anyway, but I find most CD books not to my liking anyways. I suppose I just need a great plot. Either way, it's rare I find a book not worth reading, even if i don't like it, so go read this. It's not supremely uplifting, and I can't compare it to the movie yet, but it's really not my thing. Too ordinary yet extraordinary.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I don't why but I love this game. It is&nbsp;free, what do you have to lose? That was actually my thought when I first downloaded it. Now, I check back throughout the day look for new coins so I can play. ;-)
B0093QHW7G|5.0|The definitive biography of Sir George Harrison. Scorsese outdoes himself, if that's even possible. Totally captures the magic, mysticism and majesty of one of the most influential musicians of our lifetime.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Big Fish Games are by far the best hidden object gamed out there. I usually play the free version of games I download however; this game is worth the money. Fun and not to hard that it becomes frustrating. The hint feature is a great help when you get stuck. The only reason I do not rate the game a 5 is it locked up on me at the ruins in the very end. I've tried everything to move forward but to no avail.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|getting better, but not as good as season 1. Looks like some heavy payback is coming in the remaining episodes.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory! It is great to get all the episodes all together without commercials. Great for a gift.
0345803485|1.0|So like other reviewers here I decided to read this book because I kept on hearing and hearing about it.  I was curious about what it was about.  As I was reading this, all I kept thinking was... Did I check out twilight by mistake?  Oh my gosh, what I would have given to be reading twilight instead of this crap.  It was truly awful.  This is supposed to be a love story?  First it is badly badly written and completely unbelievable.  We never really get to to know any of the characters well enough because Christian grey is always coming in and interrupting any conversations any of the characters might be having to have sex with this girl.  Jeez, enough!!! It borders on psycopathic!  And I don't know anyone that would enjoy having sex this much.<br />  The story is totally choppy, there is basically no point.  All it is two people having too much sex in so many different yet repetitive ways. (Dont ask me how this is possible). And there is two more of these?  What the hell could be the plot lines in the other two.  Do I really want to read 600 more pages where the main character is having mind blowing orgasms at every turn?  Please save yourself the time and money and find another book.  This is quite honestly the worst book ive ever read,  and ive read some pretty awful ones mind you, twilight being among them.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|Someone should follow Eddie Vedder with a video camera every day. Loved the insight into the man and his music.
B002LC2DQ4|3.0|Good stuff but the Olympus memory card that was listed as one for the camera was not compatible. So...$ down the drain.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|the dvd is bad, has some glitches when watching it, some dirt or whatever on it, dont know how, started to show first time I put it in. dont have the energy/ time to demand a refund. disappointed
B0086700CM|5.0|I love the app so much! It is so fun and addictive. It is the best app ever!  Its free!
B000ICZD5M|3.0|I love the film.  The problem was the audio, always trailing the actual speech of the actors.  This was not due to internet connection problems or computer problems.  The problem was inherent to the streaming itself.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Is so good it should be some kind of required viewing experience for us growing up , who hasn't seen it and who doesn't love it ? Amazon has the hook up on it here so buy it and be watching it and laughing your tail off in no time at all
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is super fun! I play it almost every single day. my only. problem is that games coast points
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|Who doesn't like their music and this was 1 of their best albums ever so to get it digitally and remastered at that , WINNING !
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Fun reading, of the kind that flows naturally despite the craziness. The story is so well put together. It took me a couple of days to read it.. Work and sleep got in the way.
078322804X|5.0|Movie ever ? Possibly so but regardless it's one of my favorites of all time and this collectors edition was just the ticket , buy it , like it , love it , enjoy it ! A true classic of film
B008UTV6S8|5.0|I am certainly a push over for most musicians who accompanied my life from about 1955 onwards, and Paul Simon is one of those musicians. He sounds pretty damned good on vinyl/laser recorded from inside a studio, but I was really really blown away by this recording of a live performance in New York.<br /><br />It isn't just the words and the boppy music, it is the musicianship that blows me away. And like some other 60's/70's icons, Simon rearranges his old songs so they sound new- AND you can sing along! He is obviously surrounded by other fine musicians and it sounds like it. This is a winner of an album, and the only thing that would have been better would have been to be there! [sigh]
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is my personal favorite and arguably some of the best , wildest , trippiest , craziest music ever conceived and when i began creating my digital library this had to be in there ... So put it in yours as well
B004GJDQT8|4.0|I use Amazon's website almost daily and this app makes it easy for me to compare products when I'm out.  I like the bar code/scan feature.
B008M34INW|4.0|i thought the movie was very good. i liked it. there was a lot of action and it was a fun movie too
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This was a very enjoyable read.  Harold is so wonderful and so full of life but yet so introverted.  He thought alot about things and had a real sense of himself and his values that only emerged when walking.  His pilgrimage is a journey all of us need to take.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Lady Antebellum has some really great music.  Saw them performing at yet another rewards show and had to pick it up.
B007MDQW3W|2.0|2.5 stars<br />album length: 37:18<br />11 songs.<br /><br />It's catchy. It has a few single-quality songs...tidbits she's saved from the past that really have no place in this composition.<br /><br />Besides that, there is very little to this album. It's below average by the standards she's set for herself.<br /><br />There very little album composition. The soulful moments unique to Regina Spektor way we have come to love are mostly missing.<br /><br />The producers succeeded in slapping together a few singles with some short, catchy filler to make an 11 song $11 album.<br /><br />I don't like the direction you've taken Ms. Spektor.
B003LQRYEK|5.0|my coworker wanted this movie so i was trying to help my coworker find this movie. it made him very happy thanx!!
B0053O89IS|5.0|Well I guess I  wouldn't have all the seasons of Bones if I didn't like it .  Sometimes I have to look away because It really is gross.  But I like the way the people get along and how the work out the answers. Still loven it after all these years.
B007SSEBCU|3.0|It was okay. I guess i was just expecting it to be more than it was.  It was tough getting rid of Dennis.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This app takes me back to the days of pong when PC games were h'll to install let alone play. What a great time wasting game. On a negative note, some times the game lags and you will lose a game ball when it does. That needs some work. Other than that, it's a good FAOTD.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is awesome.its so fun to play and I think all the power-ups are cool.I have no idea why some people hate it.I would definitely recamend it and the best part is its free.
B007LB0RXQ|2.0|This release isn't bad, but it's certainly not good enough to buy either. Fans of the 80/early 90s Madonna, or the 2000s Madonna (ie confessions on a dance floor) won't find anything of interest here.
B00005LK94|5.0|This is a terrific movie for young and old alike. Although it is very loosely based on a true story, it is heart warming, entertaining and timeless. When you see at how much has been refined since then and how many whooping cranes have been introduced to the wild, the value of the dream and experimentation was all worth it!!<br /><br />I have given many copies of this movie away and will continue to do so. In addition, I recommend that people follow and support Operation Migration.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Did not add many things from the 1st one. Even this way, I read all book but was a little disappointed.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|If you are looking for some fun reading with lots of action and a star character with guts and brains, this is a must read.<br />Read a Reacher novel before you go see the movie staring Tom Cruise; you will get a real hoot out of a miggit playing Reacher.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I got annoyed , like reading the same thing all the time. I have not finished, I bought Thursday in the Park and finished already. Well, I will finish some day
B008OOYALE|5.0|everything in this game cost a lot of the game money or gold which when you are first starting its hard not to spend real money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good for raise our hormones. I could not stop reading and there were lots of publicity here in Brasil about this book.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|the store doesn't even work it justs closes the game i dont recommend this.to anyone dont get it even if its free
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I am glad I purchased [[ASIN:B008CP6RWU Journey Collector's Edition]] and hope you read this spoiler free review. :)<br /><br />First of all, this amazing package comes with 3 full games: Flow, Flower, and Journey. Also, 3 Minigames that were created in 24 hours by ThatGameCompany.<br />There's 3 dynamic themes, about 16 avatars, and tons of other extra goodies like behind the scenes docemenataries, soundtracks (which are AMAZING), and the concept art.<br />The soundtracks are so soothing I exported them on my ps3 and play it when I'm cleaning :)<br /><br />Flow is a nice little game. You play an organism and eat other little organisms in a very fluid manner and you can rise to certain levels within the game, or take your way to the depths of this \\"ocean\\"; everything is very soothing. I actually had already purchased Flow for my PSP way back when, but didn't know too much about ThatGameCompany at the time.<br /><br />Flower is really fun! You're a gust of wind that gathers and blooms flower petals and journeys across different landscapes and scenaries. I smiled a lot playing this game it was peaceful and I had fun tilting the controller to move where I was going. The soundtrack here is also quite well done, and is very fitting.<br /><br />Journey is the best of the bunch here. This isn't just a game...it's an EXPERIENCE. I first watched the behind the scenes documentary prior to playing to get ready first. I had tried the demo a few months back, but I didn't understand it fully at the time either, so I put it down.<br />But now, I was ready to start my journey. You can take as long as you like...I took a few hours to play through my journey. I want to leave everything spoiler free--plus, a lot of people have already covered it so nicely--so I'll tell you right now, that this is probably the best game I've ever played. It brings back the wonders of gaming like when zelda and pokemon were new. Not that I'm comparing it to those games, but the feeling of trying something new, groundbreaking and so unique.<br />You literally travel across the world and examine ancient glyphs. There's no talking and no narrative. Just you, the landscape, and the music. Sometimes you'll run into people starting their journey as well. It was so exciting when I found someone and I chirped rapidly so they could see me. They chirped back and we met. We started traveling together and went through a majority of traveling together. I really liked how ThatGameCompany integrated the online aspect into Journey. No voice chat, no webcam thing, no text chatting...you can only communicate by musical chirps which works surprisingly really well in this game. While you journey alongside each other, it's like you create this type of silent bond with another person. Whenever I got seperated from my companion, I chirped rapidly so they could find me or they chirped so I could find them. We waited for each other to follow or we showed each other different spots in the game to gather these glowing cloth things that expand your scarf (to make you fly/glide longer). We helped each other during our journey. That just made the game even more of an experience. Whether alone or with a companion, it's totally unique.<br /><br />All you're doing is exploring this wonderous landscape of a world and experiencing...simply...a Journey.<br /><br />Best game ever. I wish it would get GOTY, but this IS the GOTY edition, with everything you get with this.<br />I think ThatGameCompany is onto big things and will only keep getting better and better at what they do.<br />I'm so glad I got to experience something like this. One more thing I would to add is that people said they cried during the game. Well, I didn't quite cry, but I did experience a little tearing up at some of the landscapes...with an epic soundtrack who can't get a little emotional! :)<br /><br />Don't play the demo, just get this or buy Journey on the Playstation Network.<br /><br />Trust me...it's a journey to experience.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very imaginative plot, technically correct.  Enjoyed his treatment of government and military sacred cows.  As always, clever dialogue, appropriate dark humor.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|ok I got this game because I was going on a rode trip so I plaayed it and it only gave me 15 min.it is real fun but the short time
B009O2XY12|5.0|love this game i play it on my phone too.Yes i would recommend this to all my friends and family.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|you get to kill all these pigs and once you start you cant stop Im usually always on it buy it or else
B003BZXI0U|3.0|We see the prehistory of the present day and cut to Eragon (Ed Speleers) before he realizes his destiny, hunting; he come across the standard virgin (Sienna Guillory) and a unique stone.  Eragon meets the standard characters as his soon to be mentor Brom (a dirty faced Jeremy Irons).  Soon circumstance will force this farmer's nephew, Eragon to have to blossom into the prototype hero. He is joined by a dragon, Saphira (voice of Rachel Weisz) that imprints on coming out.<br />Will he rise above his fears and save the princes?<br /><br />I cannot help but feel that the characters are just walking through their parts. On course if you are young and impressionable and have not seen this standard story before it may not be noticed. I used to watch \\"The Cisco Kid\\" and was impressed as a child.<br /><br />Naturally, there is nothing one can say to the reader of books except that many times, as with this example, the transition to the big screen will lose a lot of the story. However, the screenwriter did not have to tell his own story, even if it is needed to keep up the momentum. The movie does look like a pilot so maybe more will come in a sequel or a TV show.<br /><br />See the story much better done as \\"Star Wars\\" (1977) the farmer's nephew must become a hero after his uncle was burnt to a crisp. Only the mentor is Obi-wan and Saphira, our dragon is two robots and a Chewbacca.<br /><br />This film can be fun but there is nothing exceptional. Reading Joseph Campbell ahead of time can add a richer dimension to the story.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy]]
B000063DGC|5.0|This was a pleasure to listen to. Randy is one of a kind and his signature sound stands out. Suicide solution is tge best track with his 3 minute solo in the middle.
B00008BXJJ|4.0|Okay, so now I'm a little pissed.  I just bought a remastered copy of \\"AC/DC Live\\" for $6.99, not a bad deal, but it is one disc, not two.  I didn't know it was a double album.  Anyhoo, for a single 15 song set, it's worth its money.  As a rock journalist once wrote, and I believe it was Katherine Turner, although I could be wrong, \\"There are three things you can count on in life:  death, taxes, and an AC/DC concert.\\"  I saw them in Little Rock sometime around 1991 or so.  Malcolm Young was on sabbatical and replaced by their cousin Steve Young on rhythm guitar.  He didn't miss a beat.  Chris Slade was the drummer, and while I agree Phil Rudd has a bit more of a natural feel, being the drummer for so long, I simply could not complain about Slade live or on this disc, which I think was made shortly after Malcolm returned.<br />  It's actually good sense to have some live AC/DC because it's truly their format.  \\"If You Want Blood You've Got It\\" remains their definitive live statement with Bon Scott, and the newest live CD \\"Live At The River Plate\\" features some latter day material.  For those wanting a set with less newer material, this CD is probably preferable.  The band excel at simple blues based rock and roll, they've never screwed around with the formula, and as a result are one of the world's most loved bands.  Even snotty critics who loved to pan them in their earlier years have all of a sudden decided AC/DC are a great band.  I don't understand what was not to like, but critics have always been high brow pissants, loathe to like anything the masses did, and ended up championing loser bands and talentless crap that never went anywhere, just to have their own warped sense of \\"their music\\".  It's the same mentality as an art critic who thinks utter bullshit like Mark Rothko, who painted a canvas basically one or two colors with the precision and artistic flair of a cow handed a brush and a pallette.  It was an intellectual bullshit ruse made to make us think we were stupid and missing the point.  Same with critics who panned some of rock and roll's greatest music.<br />  Of course, seeing AC/DC and hearing them live is being on two different planets.  The between song banter is edited out, and we don't get to see Angus running amok, throwing himself into a seeming fit and still not missing a single note on his SG.  The power is there, though, and the mix allows Malcolm to be prominent on the left side of the mix with Angus on the other.  This highlights the interplay between the two brothers and shows how tight they are.  Highlights are the \\"Back in Black\\" cuts, \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" especially.  Brian Johnson doesn't sound like Bon Scott but his familiar growl works fine on old numbers like \\"Whole Lotta Rosie\\" and \\"TNT\\".<br />  All in all, it's a rocking set, although I would have liked to see something included from \\"Powerage\\", like the mighty \\"Down Payment Blues\\".  \\"Powerage\\" was the greatest Bon Scott era album, and deserved a cut on this album, hence the subtracting of one star.  Other than that, it's a great album at a good price.were stupid and missing the point.

B000002B2T|5.0|All members sound so vood together in this all star performance. Best song is Wake Up. You can tell it is written with Layne in mind...
B009439HEY|5.0|As a Genesis fan (see my account name) I go back to 1974 when I first heard the title track to The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway on the radio (yes kids, the radio used to actually play music like that once upon a time).  I have seen Genesis live many times, and have seen Steve Hackett live as well.  I bought Steve's first Genesis Revisted CD and found it interesting, though I agree with some of the othe reviewers that I did not always agree with his artistic choices on that work.  When I saw the song list for GR II and the list of musicians (Morse! Wilson! Stolt!) I figured, even if I didn't like all of the artistic choices on it, this had to be a CD worth owning. It overwhelmingly is.  First, the  choices of songs is excellent.  Opening with Chamber of 32 Doors...a very interesting choice.  All of Supper's Ready with beefed-up guitar work, especially at what I find to be the very emotinonal ending...but without changing the feel of the song...epic.  And the choice of a female vocal for Ripples (my wife and I list this as our favorite song by Genesis) was at first a little odd, but after a few listenings makes perfect sense.  I think Steve did a great job on GR II all the way around.  A must own for Genesis fans (especially we older fans), Steve Hackett fans, prog-rock fans (classic and neo-), and music fans in general!
B0036CWK8O|2.0|I hated tbis cd. i appreciate the fact they r attempting to show their acoustic side, but it does not do the band any justice.
B0058WFO06|4.0|Steve Wilson continues to amaze me.  I discovered him when I stumbled upon Porcupine Tree's Deadwing CD.  Since then I have purchased most of Tree's back catelogue, all of Wilson's solo work, as well as some Blackfield.  The scope, variety, and thoughtfulness of the entire catalogue is a thing of wonder.  I was looking forward to listening to Grace for Drowning given how much I liked the most recent Porcupine Tree work (The Incident) and Wilson's last solo effort (Insurgents).  I have to admit, the feel of Grace was different enough that I was initially taken aback.  Was this a collection of outtakes and seconds from Insurgents?  I was't sure what to make of it.  But after giving the CD a few listens, it became obvious that this was another manifestation of Wilson's work that fit into the entire cataloge after all.
B001W63DX2|5.0|This dvd is their best ever. every song is a highlight in and of itself. the documentary by sam dunne is just as good as the show performances.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was worth my money. I don't usually pay for books anymore  with ability to get them online from my library.  But I needed a book for traveling recently so bought this. It  kept my attention and did not want to put it down .
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have read this trilogy through twice. Is it just me or are there many of the same parts of this story that is almost identical with the movie PRETTY WOMAN?<br /><br />Granted Ana isn't a prostitute. Plus Richard Gere's character isn't into the bondage and stuff.<br /><br />Just my observation.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Some of the gore too much, but good drama/characters/acting/suspense.  It's difficult when characters you've come to know and appreciate die suddenly, though!
B006VREHRS|3.0|I bought this mainly because Buscemi is always amusing to watch.  I've only watched one episode so far but, I didn't find the pilot overly compelling .  The actors playing The characters introduced so far didn't make me feel like I can't wait to see the next episode.  I remain hopeful I'll get more into it as the episodes progress.  I bought 2 seasons of the show on Blu-Ray so I'm committed to the show now.  Hopefully I'll be watching it more enthusiastically after I see a few more episodes !

B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I am a fan of G5 games but I must admit that this one let me down big time. It is so boring and definitely not worth the money I spent for it. Finding the objects are fine but the dialogue boxes drive me absolutely crazy. Too much dialogue and not any character interaction. Just dialogue. The graphics in this game are not what I have come to expect from G5 either. Very fuzzy and the objects are very hard to see. Not hard to find, just hard to see. The more you zoom in, the worse the picture. If you really want a good game, try other ones first.
076115678X|5.0|I have always had hair that tended to get REALLY BIG.  It would start out fine after I got out of the shower and as the day progressed- my hair got more and more volume.  Blow-drying would give me hair that the big hair bands would have killed for.  My hair seriously missed its decade.  When I saw this book- I thought I would give it a try.  I was hopeful, but skeptical that it could do something to help me.  I still haven't figured out just which kind of curl my hair is- so I'm playing around with different ways of washing it.  But the difference has been HUGE.  My hair is much curlier than I every thought.  And it's not trying to soak up every bit of humidity in the air.  I can definitely go out and not worry that my hair is going to go wild on me.  My husband loves that I'm now wearing my hair down instead of always clipped up.  Was this a life changing book for me?  Probably not- but I am much happier with my hair now.  I highly encourage you to try it out!
0425263916|5.0|It took me about 5 hours to read this book. I fell in love with it as soon as I opened the cover. Would recommend this series to any & everyone. Great read. I'm just really upset that I have to wait til March of 2013 to finish the trilogy. Amazing read, great story & oh yeah, sexy as hell!!!!!
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|It's a great little lantern. Has a low, high and flashing light setting. The best part is the little green light that flashes (when batteries are in) so you can find it in the dark. Perfect light to have on hand in case of a blackout.
0345803485|5.0|This is the first erotic romance novel I've ever read, but I believe I've just found my favorite style of book to read. There are so many twists & turns but everything always came back full circle. I've recommended this book to my friends, family & coworkers. Also the occasional stranger browsing the books section of a store or just hearing someone talk about reading this book always comes up in the conversation of recommendations! Most worthy of 5 STARS!!!!!
