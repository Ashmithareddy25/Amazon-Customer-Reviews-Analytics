B00006LIRI|3.0|I'd rather give The Best of 1990-2000 three and a half stars, but as that option is unavailable, I'll round it down. There's no arguing that some of the songs here are absolute classics: \\"One,\\" \\"Beautiful Day,\\" and \\"Mysterious Ways\\" are just a few. But there are a number of reasons why this isn't the best way to get this material. <br /> <br />1) Unlike The Best of 1980-1990, here there's a lack of true artistic continuity. 1980-1990 covers the period of time when U2 made grand, political, self-righteous statements over evocative, fractured guitar work from the Edge. But here, there are songs that detail U2's exploration of throbbing club beats (a la Achtung Baby) as well as tracks that show how U2 rediscovered its 80's sound (think \\"Beautiful Day\\" and \\"Stuck in a Moment...\\"). <br /> <br />2) This compilation makes the mistake of substituting remixes of songs like \\"Gone\\" and \\"Staring at the Sun.\\" Sure, diehard fans might find these interesting, but they're inferior to the original versions. <br /> <br />3) It's missing a number of tracks that deserve to be here (for example, \\"The Fly,\\" \\"Zoo Station,\\" \\"Walk On,\\" and \\"Peace On Earth\\").  <br /> <br />Of course, there are reasons that this is still needed: it contains soundtrack songs, like the absolute killer \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me,\\" with its brilliant T. Rex lifts, as well as a Passengers tune (\\"Miss Sarajevo\\"). If the problems had been rectified, this could've been as powerful a compilation as 1980-1990. As it stands, it's a highly flawed collection that is only redeemed by its rarities.
0767802470|5.0|Having had the experience of being one of the 1411 German U Boat Commanders in my previous life, and having died and been reborn into this life here in the U.S. all during the 1940s, this film depicts life aboard an unterseeboot (underseaboat) nearly as perfectly as was humanly possible for someone to accomplish three and half decades after the war ended and without the current phoniness of the current computer images which pervade the film industry and have for quite some time.  This film even showed scenes which depicted that some of the Kreigsmarine (German Navy) were not at all impressed with how the Fuhrer (Guide) was running the country towards his imagined goals, which was a fact.  The long running time of the film was neccessary so that everything that the director wanted to convey to his audience could be experienced.  To miss this film is to miss out on reality...
0596009208|5.0|I'm currently on my 8th week of my 1st Java class in college and this book has saved my life and a bunch of my hair, too. I'm a rookie in Java, so I can't give you all the in and out about Java, but all I know is that 8 weeks ago I didn't know anything about Java and today I'm coding, understanding concepts and what's going on when I see codes, most important, doing great in class, and this book has a lot to do with it.     The approach of the book to Java is great, it's fun and entertaining and most important, it shows you how to, in a day by day examples, approach and learn Java. Java is different from all other programming languages, vocabulary is not even close to other p/l, but this book makes it very friendly. I'm a lazy reader and I'm almost done reading this book, believe me this is a lot to say...    Down side, the professor did say that GUI is kind of weak and some subjects, like IO and networking are not deep enouph discussed. On the other hand, she will use it as the class book from now on. Don't even try to execute exercises if you don't have the latest version of Java, 1.5    Saying that, I 100% recommend it...
0441172717|5.0|The complete Dune Saga is a masterpiece, especially for those interested in understanding politics and the role of religion in our society. I won't go into a synopsis of the story, if you haven't already gotten a pretty good idea what Dune is about from reading the 480 other reviews and/or haven't seen the movie(s), then frankly, you are just not paying attention.   <br /> <br />Dune is science fiction, but that is not what makes the book important. Frank Herbert is a pure student of anthropology and has an in depth understanding of the powerful, the powerless and all those in between. He also clearly demonstrates the techiniques that are used to motivate the masses. In the Dune saga Herbert investigates the archetypal messianic myth and why that myth is so influential to humans. In so doing he unmasks fundamentalists for what they are (fearful beyond reaon), while at the same time demonstrating the freedom in pure Spirituality.  <br /> <br />This one is a must read for Science fiction buffs, but more importantly, this is a must read for students of humanity.

0553801503|5.0|I'm only halfway through 'A Feast For Crows'. Having come to the series late, I only had to wait a few months after finishing 'A Storm Of Swords' - not 5 years like some other readers. So I honestly don't know how this one would have seemed to me after that long a wait. Maybe I too would be slamming it like so many reviewers. Having said which -  <br /> <br />I'm loving it every bit as much as the others. Having decided that Mr Martin is a writer to be trusted, I'm following my usual practice of placing myself entirely in his hands and trotting along to wherever he chooses to take me. If he's decided to move at a more leisurely and meandering pace, and explore some of the more arcane and bizarre corners and pockets of Westeros, great. Count me in. I'm happily tagging along. <br /> <br />I don't care if the plot if not being advanced in any major way. Or if there's an absence of dramatic high points. Or if there's not even a serious clue to how it will all turn out. Westeros is a delight to explore, the characters remain unique and fascinating in their own ways - yes, even Brienne, even all the minor characters and bit players and supporting cast. Each is unique and finely-drawn. Each one even has his own style of speech, immediately recognisable. Now that's real writing.

B000002J1U|5.0|Though I'm probably beating a dead horse at this point, I feel compelled to add my opinion to the pile.  This really is a beautiful album.  After opening with what might just be the single song that rocks more than any other song ever did or will, it slows down to balance that out with some of the finest acoustic guitar playing you'll ever hear from a hard rock band.  Thirty something years later, it holds up as well as ever.

0060090367|2.0|I enjoyed \\"Rachel's Holiday\\" and decided to try another book by Marian Keyes. I'm sorry I chose this one. While there were some amusing one-liners, I found little else to like. Nothing rang true - not the characters, not their relationships, and not the situations they found themselves in. I sympathized with Claire initially, but her self-absorbed babble wore thin all too soon. I got tired of the book about halfway through and skimmed to the end. I was almost sorry I did, because the scales were ridiculously tipped by the husband's behavior (though his description of Claire seemed pretty much spot on to me).
0790729393|4.0|Based on fact . . . Well, if you'd ever been to one of those correctional units at that time, you would have seen some of the creeps who worked there.  True, you might not find four guards of the same ilk who conspired to abuse the same four boys for the duration of their incarceration, but the abuse was there.  As for the retribution being homophobic, the Amazon reviewer seems to think that pederasty is gender specific.  To label the film as such is misleading.  The strength of the film is compounded by the likes of Dustin Hoffman, Robert Deniro, and a handful of character actors who make their roles seem as natural and as effortless as a native of Hell's Kitchen stepping off of a curb.  The younger actors, some of whom boast of \\"superstar\\" status, rightfully pale in the presence of the relentless characterization of their elders.  Would that all the bad guys get the same comeuppance, would that down-and-out lawyers be given a last chance to shine, would that every neighborhood have a local priest who similarly embraced his parish.  Forget the verisimilitude; suspend your disbelief, enjoy the movie.
B000002KXV|5.0|My first introduction to Donald Fagen, was his \\"New Frontier\\" video on MTV, which was in heavy rotation in 1983.  Brillant video that accurately protrayed the story related in a great song.  (A special thanks to all the people who have posted the \\"New Frontier\\" video on You Tube.)  I loved the song and the video. <br /> <br />Years later with \\"New Frontier\\" stuck in my head on a constant mental replay track, I bought \\"The Nightfly\\", and was amazed by how brillant the album was.  The first shock was hearing \\"I.G.Y-International Geophysical Year\\", which I still hear on the radio, but never knew it was Donald Fagen.  This is the first song on the album, followed by more wonderful songs. <br /> <br />It's a concept album, with the theme of the Atomic Age/New Frontier movement of the late 1950's and early 1960's.  It captures both the optimism of new technology leading the way, with the underlying hint of fear, that some of this Atomic Age technology might be the end of the world.  The pop culture references in some of the songs are wonderful, as they help convey the feeling of that time.  The song \\"New Frontier\\" has several references-actress Tuesday Weld from \\"The Many Lives of Dolby Gillis\\" and Jazz great Brubeck are mentioned in it.  As far as concept albums go, I would put this up there with Pink Floyds \\"The Wall\\" or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\".  It is much closer to \\"Dark Side\\" musically.      <br /> <br />The best thing about \\"The Nightfly\\" is it's mellow, with catchy hooks and grooving rhythms.  It's great to listen both actively to hear the stories convenved in the songs, but also works if you just want nice background music.  Some of songs are also fun for dancing too. I can listen to this entire album from start to finish, happy with every song on it.  It's a rare for an artist to be able to put out an album like that.  I'd love to see the videos made for this album released on DVD.

B00005JOSS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of romance, but toss in some urban fantasy, and you've got me. This is the most original romance I've seen in years and years.  <br /> <br />I've never been a Keanu Reeves nor Sandra Bullock fan, but I have to admit, in a romantic setting, these two have amazing chemistry as well. While the story is slow at times, the more powerful and gripping moments really get to you, and whenever there is a scene between Reeves and Bullock, you'll be watching. <br /> <br />They have a DVD sale from me already, count on it.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|This longer version of the film is really a huge step up from the disjointed, disappointing and confusing film I saw in the theater.  I'd heard that this version included some plotlines that were initially edited out, but I had no idea they'd hacked out so many important scenes, not to mention whole characters!   <br /> <br />Most of Sibylla's character arc (which prominently featured a young SON who never appeared in the theatrical version) was just ripped out of the movie.  It's a major plotline and it completely explains everything she does in the movie.  Where before her character was puzzling and seemed to be over-reacting to everything ... now she makes complete sense.  And hers is actually the most moving story arc in the film now.  I know the studio wanted Ridley to cut the movie down so they could cram in more screenings at your local multiplex, but this was a very bad choice of things to cut. <br /> <br />This version also answers some of the nagging questions I'd had during my first viewing of the shorter version of the film.  Like \\"Why does Balian, who's just a blacksmith who's never been to war, seem to know a great deal about battle strategy and how to build war machines and irrigation systems?\\"  (Well, it turns out he HAS been to war ... as an engineer and builder of war machines.)  And \\"what's the deal with that psychotic priest in the opening scenes?\\"  (The priest is actually his BROTHER!  And the ill will between the two goes back a long way.) <br /> <br />On the whole, this movie doesn't quite measure up to Gladiator, but this longer version is a far sight better than the theatrical version.  If you haven't seen either one ... see this one.  It's longer, but it's definitely worth it.
B00011D1RC|4.0|Published in 1921, Vicki Baum's German-language novel MENSCHEN IM HOTEL was an international bestseller.  MGM purchased the rights and employed William A. Drake to adapt the novel to the stage.  Titled GRAND HOTEL, it proved a great success on the Broadway stage, and with its fame as both novel and play the studio made the property the focus of its powerful array of contract talent.  It was smash with both critics and audiences and won the Academy Award as Best Picture of 1932.<br /><br />Although the 1930s was notable for social dramas, audiences of the Great Depression wanted an escape from the hardship of their lives, and no expense was spared to create the glittering and very high-gloss image moviegoers craved.  Designed by legendary art director Cedric Gibbons, who mixed Deco and Moderne styles to tremendous effect, each set was built specifically for the film and no detail was overlooked; Adrian's costumes were also meticulous in their combination of high-fashion and romance.  No detail was overlooked, and in terms of production values alone few films before or after have bested GRAND HOTEL.<br /><br />But if GRAND HOTEL is distinctly of its era in terms of visual style, it is also distinctly of its era in terms of performance, and it is here that we run into a bit of trouble.  Most actors of the silent era relied on a mannered performance style that compensated for the lack of sound.  The arrival of sound forced them to invent a new performance style, and some proved more adaptable than others.  In many respects, GRAND HOTEL is a study of the struggle to invent this new way of acting; some of the performers are excessively large, some are in transition between silent and sound modes, and some are distinctly modern in their approach.<br /><br />In terms of story, GRAND HOTEL presents several overlapping and interweaving plotlines.  Celebrated ballerina Grusinskaya (Garbo) is performing in Berlin--and is a deep depression that threatens her career.  Baron von Geigern (John Barrymore) is in desperate need of money--and has agreed to steal Grusinskaya's famous pearls.  When Grusinskaya's suicide attempt collides with the Baron's intended theft, romance is result.  At the same time, industrialist Preysing (Wallace Beery) has arrived at the hotel in an effort to conclude a important business deal and has hired a stenographer named Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford) to assist him--but Preysing is unaware that company accountant Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) has been diagnoised with a terminal illness and has taken rooms at the hotel, determined to enjoy himself before he dies.  These characters, along with Grusinskaya's maid (Rafaela Ottiano), the hotel doctor (Lewis Stone), and various hotel employees (including Jean Hersholt) collide repeatedly over the course of a few days--and none will emerge entirely unscathed from their encounters.<br /><br />John Barrymore was noted for his larger-than-life performances on the stage, and he brought that same quality to many silent films; less fortunately, he also carried into the sound era, and his performance reads as excessively large.  Although Garbo was a great star in the silent era, she quickly adapted to the new demands of sound in such films as ANNA CHRISTIE--but when faced with Barrymore's over-the-top performance she responds in kind, and the result is visually beautifully but incredibly mannered, and their scenes are not greatly aided by their dialogue, which is itself very much in \\"the grand manner.\\"  Although they are indeed fascinating, their performances are distinctly out of synch with the rest of the film, where a more natural style of acting is the norm.<br /><br />While Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone are quite good, and while Lionel Barrymore is unexpectedly effective (and much less mannered than his brother John), it is really Joan Crawford that points the way toward the new acting style.  Crawford herself had worked in silents, and scored notable successes in such films asOUR DANCING DAUGHTERS, but she has made an easy leap to the sound era and never overplays her hand; Flaemmchen is among the best of her early performances, and Crawford herself thought it among the best of her overall career.  She wasn't wrong.<br /><br />With the acting styles all over the map, GRAND HOTEL requires a modern viewer to make constant mental shifts; consequently, the film sometimes feels more than a little uphill.  Even so, there are plenty of compensations: Garbo at the height of her beauty; Lionel Barrymore's multi-layered performance; a Crawford classic; and always, always the lush look and feel of the movie.  Although I think it will most appeal to film buffs, there is no denying the thing has power, even though that power has become somewhat obscured by the passing years.<br /><br />Both print and sound are excellent, and although there are only a few bonuses--and very short ones at that--the \\"making of\\" documentary is excellent and the footage of the premiere is nothing short of fascinating.  Recommended for film buffs, especially those strong on 1930s film.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewerfilms as OUR DANCING DAUGHTERS, but she has made an easy leap to the sound era and never overplays her hand; Flaemmchen is among the best of her early performances, and Crawford herself thought it among the best of her overall career.

0553804677|4.0|You won't find the meaning of life in The Lies of Locke Lamora, but will have a lot of fun. It's a story of thieves, deception, and friendship. Thieves who are sometimes too good to be true, but you won't care. Just read and laugh and have fun. The writing is impressive for a debut. Don't expect too much character development, but a lot of action and very intriguing fantasy elements. I'm sorry to say that the sequel (Red Seas Under Red Skies) is not as good, but it was this book that left me with such *huge* expectations.
1416905014|5.0|This is an exquisitely done work of art, with pop-ups that rival origami.  I purchased it for my four year old granddaughter' birthday, but found that even at that age, supervision when reading (and care turning pages) is advisable.  It is a book to be kept for years and handed down for generations.  A great find and well worth the investment.
B000E6ESL2|1.0|This movie was touted as a \\"dramatic thriller\\", and turned out to be anything but. As supernatural as War and Peace (and twice as hard to follow), Stay is more of an indy-artsy-sad movie than true thrill ride. With plenty of dizzying camera shots and a non-sensical ending to boot, the movie leaves the viewer feeling rather disheartened and wishing they'd stayed long enough at Blockbuster to pick another movie.
0375703764|1.0|Like Frankenstein's monster, the embodiment of pastiche:  dig up an old corpse, slap on some extraneous and slightly decomposed body parts, dress it up in claims of \\"ten years of hard work,\\" add some intelligent design (heavy-handed, but intelligent)--all shot through with a lightning bolt of inspired marketing.  All the parts are there and technically, it works.  Like Frankenstein's monster.  Which is precisely why THIS peasant is ready to storm the good doctor's castle, pitchfork in hand, to demand an end to such unholy abuse of my good will as a reader.  Yeah, if the author cut me a check for my $3 bucks, I'd cash it in good conscience.  (Sorry, Mr. Danielewski, I bought it used.  And why can't I escape the nagging suspicion that you're compelled to read these reviews--regularly?)    Having been made curious by all the hype, I truly wanted to love this book, but more puzzling than puzzle, more poesy than poetic, it just never comes to life in any meaningful inner way, never breathes the fire of the great truths.  (Cormac McCarthy, this guy ain't.)  Its breath stanks more of The Academy than the street and when it was over I felt like I needed a shower--and not in any good way.  Its burdensome narrative complexities and ceaseless stylistic flourishes serve not to create and illuminate a world with the fire and fetid fertility of life, but rather to conceal one with a sterile stonewall of distance:  that of who the writer really is, artistically, or what he might really think or have to say.  Who is this guy?  Truly, we are not meant to know.  I find that hypocritical and disingenuous, sir, especially from a first novel;  ya gotta get in to get out.  (Readers will be forgiven for suspecting there's no \\"there\\" there.)  Please don't misunderstand--I'm not buying into any cult of personality--no inquiring mind who wants to know the author's dirty laundry.  But the manufactured \\"cult-favorite\\" status lavished on the book (especially by its publisher) plus the author'smuch-publicized on-stage performances of passages of the book with his rock-star sister, whose CD intersected thematically with \\"House of Leaves,\\" strikes me as gratuitously opportunistic and just a little too precious.  Come on, guys, should you really be trying to poach those poor Steven King readers away from their Special Collector's Edition Boxed DVD Set of 'The Matrix' Trilogy?       I think it would be cool--Utopian--if an author could be a rock star in our culture, but that's a status that may be only bestowed, never claimed or asserted.  So meet the new boss, same as the old boss, conning chumps on the midway with special effects and slight-of-hand, merely playing pretend rock star in order to score groupie chicks or get better tables at trendy restaurants--an act that owes far more to Kiss than The Beatles.  And what's so revolutionary about that?                                                       --------------------                                                                                                                                     Footnote:  On a flight to Boston, I sat next to and struck up a sizzling conversation with a smart and beautiful grad student who fixed her gaze into my eyes as we talked and touched my arm as she laughed at my jokes.  She even gave me her numbers, unasked.  But when I mentioned that I had just begun reading \\"House of Leaves,\\" she backed off and asked me if I am still living with my parents.  Of course, she never returned my call.

B00082IJ08|4.0|Demon Days is a solid purchase with several excellent tracks (rather than one or two splashes in the pan), but it's not in my all-time Top 20 albums.      The vocals, harmonies, and underlying tone of the Gorillaz's Demon Days make this a solid purchase.  I have happily listened to this CD for hours at home, in the office, and on road-trips.  However, it is not a \\"must-have\\" collection necessity of a U2 Joshua Tree or Actung Baby, Dr Dre Chronic, Moby Play, or a Green Day American Idiot - it's just a shade below their caliber. If you (or the person you are buying for) enjoy any combination of the above albums, then you'll be quited pleased with this disc.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Any movie that shows women's emotions and actually treats them with an ounce of respect is a \\"chick flick\\" that most men want to stay away from. Which is opposed to the \\"guy flick\\" where the women are treated like sex objects and there are a bunch of explosions and deaths. Come on guys. Are you mature men or 12 year old boys? Maybe if some men spent more time trying to understand women rather than objectifying them they might have better luck getting girlfriends. <br /> <br />This is PARTIALLY what Something's Gotta Give is about: how women want to be treated vs. how men THINK women want to be treated. <br /> <br />It's an excellent, funny, smart, refreshing movie. How often do we see an older man with an older woman in a romantic film nowadays? How often does that couple have excellent chemistry and actually look natural? Jack and Diane look and act like they had so much fun with this.  <br /> <br />One nickpick I have is with Amanda Peet. She played her role too strait-laced and ended up coming off as boring. It really would have been a ball if she had mustered the off-kilter, slightly psychotic character she played in Saving Silverman. She's proven she can do decent comedy. Other than this small criticism, great flick.

The cardboard box which holds 5 paper sleeves to keep the cds is very well designed and the low price for 5 discs makes this great value for money.  The only gripe I have with this is the patchy sound quality.  We get great sound levels and production on some of the symphonies but noticeably on Symphony No. 9, the sound quality seems to suffer a little and this is also the case for parts of Symphony No. 6.  Otherwise, this is a great way for collectors of Bernstein's works to start a collection.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|My first glimpse of Errol Morris' work (The Thin Blue Line) was for an undergraduate history seminar examining the role (and subsequent fallacy) of human memory in historical discourse.  While \\"The Thin Blue Line\\" examined a singular Texas murder, Morris' \\"Fog of War\\" has a larger footprint since it probes an extremely sharp and cognizant 80+ year old McNamara and his position in United States war policy over a thirty year span.  World War II and Vietnam obviously provide a lot of ground to cover in a documentary, but the \\"larger footprint\\" of Morris' film rests with the controversial nature of McNamara in the public's mind versus the historical record.  In short, McNamara bears some responsibility (and perhaps lingering guilt) for his recommendations in the WWII bombing and the Vietnam policy.  The Vietnam War was not his action alone, however; he was part of a national security apparatus submitting recommendations to the only man who could act:  The President of the United States.  Accordingly, McNamara bears partial responsibility but he is well aware of a popular desire for his complete contrition.  Yet, he now bears the sole burden for these group actions because he was the face of the Vietnam policy for two presidents and he is one of the few presidential advisors still alive from the Kennedy/Johnson Era (as well as the WWII bombing decisions).  McNamara is certainly aware of his position as well as the fact that certain portions of the American public want a criminal confession from the man.   <br /> <br /> <br />With that \\"public pitfall\\" in mind, McNamara's explanations and answers to Morris' questions can appear scheming and duplicitous, but those answers simply place decisions and policy in their proper historical framework.  At one point in the film, Morris' essentially asks McNamara who was responsible for Vietnam decisions and McNamara quickly replies, \\"The President\\".  The audience (or at least, I) wanted McNamara to answer, \\"It was my decision\\" and -as such - may view the President Response as a cop-out.  However, McNamara is absolutely correct; the decision for action rested with the Commander-in-Chief and his name was never Robert Strange McNamara.  From the audience's perspective, it is nothing short of compelling to watch a man justify unpopular actions while dodging an undue burden of responsibility and respecting (i.e., not damning) the two presidents he served and loved. <br /> <br /> <br />Personally, I relished the personal insights Morris captured (or that McNamara permitted himself to show?).  These poignant glimpses ranged from McNamara's tearful story of surveying Arlington National Cemetery for Kennedy's eventual burial plot to the fleeting family health references confronting the McNamara Family during the Secretary of Defense years.  My favorite insight into McNamara's soul comes during the retelling of the young Quaker who set himself on fire below McNamara's office mere moments after handing his baby daughter to a pleading bystander.  While the story is well known, McNamara pays respect to the widow's subsequent explanation and appears to have kept tabs on the daughter.  I am still not sure what to make of that insight and dozens of others, but those personal glimpses are the underlying force of the film. <br /> <br /> <br />In terms of filmmaking, some reviews have blasted Morris' technique of being off camera and unmiked, his use of the Glass soundtrack, or his reliance on public domain stock footage of planes, bombing, or protests.  In many respects, they are right:  either you love Morris' methods or they will grate on you.  The editing cuts can be choppy, but it is unclear how much of that is for dramatic effect or if the original interviews went back and forth over the same material.  If you enjoy a bombastic Michael Moore-type figure guiding the audience through a series of contrived events peppered with sarcastic and puerile rhetoric, then \\"The Fog of War\\" may not be the documentary for you and worth a local rental.  On the other hand, if you enjoyed Morris' earlier \\"The Thin Blue Line\\" or Barbara Kopple's \\"Harlan County, USA\\" and \\"American Dream\\", then you will want to buy this DVD for the theatrical release, deleted scenes, and McNamara's own rules. <br />

I mean, for the entire film he suspects her of being a cold-blooded killer yet he allows himself to sleep with her and fall in love with her. He's so stupid. I don't know any \\"magna cum laude p***y\\" worth getting an icepick in the throat.    But seriously, it's a movie where the sex scenes are actually integral to the plot. That alone makes it at least 4 stars. Seriously. The sex scenes are like suspense scenes. Each time they make love you're waiting for the icepick.    This movie is also complex. To this day, people still debate as to whether the ending was really as simple as \\"she killed them all.\\" Was Dr. Elisabeth Garner really as innocent as initially perceived? She seemed to have some issues and a few skeletons in her closet that could have been explored further.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|never jumped on the Nirvana experience(though they did have alot of talent). never bought a FooFighters' cd before either, but I liked the idea of an electric and acoustic cd split so i took the plunge and I am glad I  did.  I was not disappointed.   the collection goes the full gamet of the rock music experience. from rock to edgy to punkish & loud to soft and introspective, and all points in between.  Love their instrument playing and Grohl's voice has many different qualities to it.  Sometimes metal somtimes pop, reminds me a little of Silverchair's last cd a few years back, but FF have their own topics to sing about and have done things their own way musically as well.   <br />
8495501007|3.0|This book came to my attention only after I saw the movie The Ninth Gate, and I was immediately interested.  The movie seemed to leave several questions unanswered, and I believed that a book would be a better medium for a mystery about books than film.  Well, it was, but I was still left with unanswered questions. <br /> <br />The book follows the expolits of Lucas Corso, an alcoholic anti-hero, as he tracks down the source of exceedingly rare occult literature as a mercenary book trader.  The best parts of the book center around his relationship with a strange girl with green eyes, who joins him for unexplained reasons on his quest.  However, loosely connected to this intriguing investigation is a manuscript chapter from The Three Musketeers, which takes on strange dimensions as character parallels from the Musketeers oppose him on his journey.  The background is peopled with unique characters, and various asides are devoted to describing the murky world of the rare book black market, the biography of Alexandre Dumas, or the nature of the devil and medieval occult practices. <br /> <br />These excerpts answered many of the questions posed by the film, fleshing out my understanding of plenty of side-issues.  Several illustrations in the book also made these chapters more enjoyable.  It was only at the end that I despaired of an explanation that united the two detective stories of Dumas and the devil.  Instead of everything \\"coming together\\" as in a Sherlock Holmes story, the motivation for the entire quest comes unravelled into two distinct threads which are only coincidentally united.  I admit that the movie had spoiled the final twist for me, which is perhaps the reason I found it unsatisfying.  However, the author seems to have made some effort to assert the unity of the two strands of plot via Corso himself, who reflects to himself that he is caught in a literary twilight zone and refuses to be surprised by events which refer to literature.  During the pursuit,I was pleased by all of this, but only on the condition of an eventual rationale.  The rationale, once revealed, left me unimpressed.   <br /> <br />Not that the book is without its charm; in fact, much in the style of Umberto Eco, the answer to the mystery is not the fanciful one the main character supposes- or rather, not the whole answer.  The Club Dumas reminded me of Eco's book Foucault's Pendulum in particular, although this one is much more digestable to a leisurely fan.  I will continue to suspect that the movie  for The Ninth Gate spoiled the book for me; therefore, I would recommend anyone interested in this subject to read the book prior to the movie.  The aftertaste may be more palatable.

B0009WFF7M|5.0|For years I've read that this was a fluke success for a band that defied labelling. An album that gets to 20th-anniversary status - and is still selling well - AND got a Grammy this year - well, somehow I don't really see that as a fluke. I see it for what it was and is - superior musicianship, top-notch writing, and an instantly recognizable voice that brings listeners to places few others can.<br /><br />When this album first came out, it rarely left my stereo; now, twenty years along, I have four copies of it that I am aware of - it's possible there are more, with numerous relocations on my part; if I couldn't find my current copy after moving somewhere, I was apt to just go buy another to save time. This was the apex for Dire Straits, their absolute shining moment; it showed Mark Knopfler for the guitar master he is, as well as his unmatched talent for penning good songs. He deserves all the accolades he has gotten for bringing this watershed effort to fans everywhere.<br /><br />There is nothing to say about the music that hasn't already been said, other than personal favourites on an album without a bad song on it; \\"Ride Across The River\\", which I could not listen to sitting down; \\"The Man's Too Strong\\", which is fairly spooky; \\"Walk Of Life\\" (I was a busker in Australia and can relate), one of his most upbeat songs; and the ubiquitous \\"Money For Nothing\\" which drove a former employer crazy every time I played it (20 years on, I'm still in love with that guitar riff, though I'm sure Mark Knopfler is tired of it).<br /><br />This band may have left critics scrambling for description, but they knew how to make their adoring fans happy in a way that few bands have ever accomplished. It says something that the people who loved them then still do - to the point of making this album a 20-year event.
0767020308|5.0|I am a big Jane Austen fan (having taken a seminar of her writing in college).  I enjoy most adaptions of her books but the A&E adaption is really wonderful!  The characters are portrayed exactly like the book and Emma has all the pride of status, and all the kindness towards family, that Austen depicts.  Mark Strong, as Knightly, does an excellent job with a difficult part.  Knightly can seem creepily paternal (his age and his advice to Emma) but Strong makes him appropriate and smoldering even for a modern viewer.  The characters in this film have such depth and the costuming is beautiful!
068987149X|1.0|I understand the power of overcoming adversity, but as the seeds travel, one of the \\"drowns,\\" one dies in the desert, one is eaten by a bird...I think it is a disturbing little book, actually.  It certainly should never have been made into a board book.  There are too many words on the page to keep the attention of a toddler or preschooler.  The ending seems abrupt as well.  I haven't been impressed with the Carle books I have read.
0375831002|5.0|Well written historical tale whereas Zusak wields his poetic words like a prize fighter. A must read for anyone with a conscience.
B00005JOSS|5.0|Once in a while, a film comes along that is truly transcendent.  For the film, it takes on a soul of its own beyond the intention of the filmmakers.  For the individual, it transcends the mind and the heart to touch the soul in ways even we don't understand.  How many of us have relationships in our past that profoundly impact the future?  And how many of us long for a future that was lost in the past?  Those who quibble about the premise miss the intelligence of the story...the chronology of Alex and Kate's lives is precisely the same, only the inanimate object, the mailbox itself, is in a time warp. <br /> <br />This is a film about relationships.  Relationships between children and parents, between siblings, between friends, and yes, between lovers.  Those who (like me) expected the schlocky chick flick were sorely disappointed and were instead treated to a visually stunning view into the nature of what it means to be human.  I believe this will be a film for the ages, one that will one day take its place in the grand tapestry of great films.  But darn it, I'm living in 2006, so I guess I'll have to ask the future if I'm right? <br /> <br />

0316172324|5.0|This book should be read by anyone who is looking to add to there intellect and by anyone who is yearning to learn more and more about people. I think of this book as the next level to a movie like Crash. Crash is an icredible film that illustrates how connected all of us are, and how convaluted our decisions can become if we rely merely on prejudice and stereotypes. Blink tells us why we do that. Blink explains why we make these snap judgements and touches on how such snap judgements can be helpful or detrimental. Blink also talks about cultivating our subjective unconsciousness into something that we can use in our everyday life, whether it involves love or the work place.  <br /> <br />This one is for the human who are dedicated to take their intelligence to the next level.
0780626966|4.0|I'll start out by saying that I prefer the Jason movies.  I think the whole body count is a fun way to watch a horror movie.  The Freddy movies are good horror movies, but they're not really slashers like I thought they would be.     - A Nightmare on Elm Street -     A great, classic horror movie by Wes Craven.  He creates good high school characters, although trying to prove that they're only 15 years old is a little far-fetched.  Freddy is more horrific and scary, he doesn't say much.    - A Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge -     They were asking for it when they completely changed the style and rules of Freddy in this sequel.  Many will disagree, but I don't think it's a bad movie, it's just very dark and horrific.    - A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors -     Definately a step up from Part 2.  It goes back to the roots of the original film and brings back Nancy, who is now studying dreams and sleep in a mental hospital.  The style brings us back to the original movie with the same rules and objectives.    - A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master -     Decent entry in the series carrying over characters from #3 and introducing all new characters.  The story doesn't flow as easily this time around and it's a step down from Part 3, but still good.    - A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child -    Stephen Hopkins' visual style makes this the best sequel in the series.  Freddy is hilarious and the special effects are great.  The story is more interesting than Part 4 and the characters have matured since that movie which is good.    - Freddy's Dead - The Final Nightmare -     Cheesy storyline trying to tell us that in 10 years there will be no kids left in an American town?  Rachel Talalay thinks the 3-D effects in the film are lame, but not that story element?  If it weren't for the interesting backstory on Freddy, this wouldn't be a good movie.    - Wes Craven's New Nightare -     Wes Craven did succeed in making an interesting and well made horror movie here, but it is a little strange to include it in the rest of the series.  Better watched on its own and not consecutively with the other movies.    - Nightmare Encyclopedia -     Alot of interviews that aren't edited very interestingly make for a decent special features disk.  It's good to see that these interview aren't self serving at all and they're completely retrospective, it would've been nice to hear more from Heather Langenkamp, or possibly Johnny Depp?    This is a great set for extreme fans and a good set for casual fans.  I'm a huge fan of the Alien series and a pretty big fan of the Predator series, but not as much as Alien.  I would say that I'm now a huge fan of Jason and a good sized fan of Freddy in comparison to Alien/Predator.  I do recommend these movies, but this enormous box with annoying cardboard cases is outdated for today.

B000FILW86|4.0|From 1977 thru 1979, Cheap Trick was a huge critical and commercial smash. They gained respect and a loyal following with their first three studio albums. Then \\"Live at Budokan\\" propelled them into superstardom both here and abroad. But as the 80's rolled around, the magic was lost and their albums contained more lumps of coal than diamonds. Radio pretty much turned their back on any new Cheap Trick material and the band went from headlining stadiums to headlining 200 seat dinner clubs. All the while, loyal fans kept hoping and praying that the band could soon return us to the 70's.     Well, some prayers may have been answered with this latest release, \\"Rockford,\\" named after the Illinois city where the band started out.  Finally, a new Cheap Trick album you can listen to more than once is upon us.  Though not as great as those first three albums, I think this is Cheap Trick's most consistent work since then. Songs such as \\"If it takes a lifetime,\\" \\"Give it Away\\" and \\"This time you got it\\" evoke memories of their heyday. And the other songs are not too shabby either as I find myself smiling through most of the 12 tracks. Robin Zander's voice fortunately did not go the Robert Plant route. His vocals are still as strong and powerful as they were all those years ago as are Rick Nielsen's guitar licks, Tom Peterson's bass lines, and BUn E. Carlos' drummming.     If you are like me then it means that at their concerts, you could care less if they play anything recorded after 1979. But now I finally have something new to listen to. Try this album. Not a classic(as I consider the first three to be) but definitely a return to form.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|Here was George Cloony's oportunity to educate people on what goes on and the Movie was a total drag...Everyone I have talked to has had the same experience..The movie made no sense..no matter How many times I tried to figure it out. It was an effort to keep watching it to the end..a total waste of time and money..
1558216847|5.0|I can't reccomend this book strongly enough. A stunning unusal memoir. The authour presents an epic journey of incredible daring and endurance as a matter of fact everyday adventure.<br /><br /> Well written and briskly paced I couldn't put it down. A somewhat short book I got bummed out as I got about 3/4 through it simply realizing this great story was coming to it's end.<br /><br /> I was also very amused by the fact that the whole reason for the telling of this story(a glimpse of a yeti) was dealt with in three paragraphs.
0765348780|1.0|That is as far as I got.  I could not go any further.  I kept asking myself what am I reading and why do a care.  The characters hold little interest, and the style of writing nearly incoherent.  Don't believe the Publisher Weekly's review, this book is nothing like the novels of George R R Martin.
B000BBOUCW|2.0|I remember playing Final Fantasy VII when it first came out in 1997.  I was eleven years old.  The game was one of the greatest I ever played.  I am now nineteen going on twenty and I still play through it constantly.  The storyline was divine (albeit, didn't completely come together in the end), the characters memorable, and it still has one of the most memorable video game moments in history.  When one of your main characters is killed off permanently with no way to revive said character.  Final Fantasy VII set the bar.<br /><br />Years later, a sequel is announced and now we have Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.  A movie which was countlessly downloaded on file sharing services such as bit torrent before actually being released in the US.  Many fans saw the movie long before it came out in the US.  I was one of those who decided to wait, as Final Fantasy VII was a game that could easily have a unsatisfactory sequel.  After watching the movie, I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VII Advent Children has a good \\"cool\\" factor going for it.  It looks really beautiful.  Almost lifelike in it's graphical capacity.  As far as CGI animated films go, this is the best looking ever released.  The characters hair moves in the wind in separate lines, even.  Even the little things get some good detail.  So if you're looking for a movie that really looks good, Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children delivers.<br /><br />The fight scenes aren't so bad, but they're not great either.  The camera pans around and shifts too much.  The fight scenes also look cool.  They look startling unrealistic, even for Final Fantasy.  Characters flying around and doing things they otherwise couldn't do in the game.  A lot of it pans out in either bullet time slow motion like the Matrix, or really fast as if you've pressed fast-forward on a VCR.  Sometimes it gets annoying, but often this really doesn't.  However, it doesn't separate from the fact that there's really no depth to the fight scenes.  They seem to be there to further enhance the eye candy of the movie.  The good news, however, is that it manages to give the viewer the feel of a video game.<br /><br />The storyline is what really hurts Advent Children, however.  There's a virus going around called Geostigma.  The movie makes you think that this is a horrible virus that's a huge threat.  We never see just how this virus is a threat, however.  No one actually succumbs to Geostigma, and the origin of Geostigma gets very little, if any, attention at all.  It just sort of popped up out of nowhere.  Along those lines, three new villians are looking for \\"mother\\" who happens to be Jenova.  The storyline could've really molded into something special.  I was hoping the movie would follow the formula of the game.  Take a very basic thing, and turn it into something complex, original, and inspiring.  Advent Children doesn't do that.  The story also ends with a Deus Ex Machina.<br /><br />Along those lines, the characters receive little, if any, development at all.  The only character who seems to get any is Cloud Strife.  When all the other major characters from Final Fantasy VII show up, they have maybe one or two lines and then they're tossed aside like yesterday's newspaper.  It feels like these characters were just thrown in there to fulfill fanboy and fangirl fantasies.  There's little emotion from these characters as well.  None of them express any worry or hope for Cloud when he goes into the final battle.<br /><br />Some characters have also come back and are a little different than what they were in the game.  The humor of this movie mostly comes from the Turks.  In the game they were not really the ones who provided humor.  In fact, in the game they were rather suave and cool.  They don't take that cool and suave attitude into the movie, though.  But it did provide the movie with some much needed humor.<br /><br />A lot of the movie feels rather emotionless.  The poor dialogue mixed with bad English voice overs doesn't help either (the most common line people bring up is Tifa's \\"Dilly dally shilly shally\\").<br /><br />The music score redeems some of it.  A lot of the tracks from the game have been remixed.  While I like the more orchestrated versions of them, the rock music theme for these tracks isn't bad.  No where near as good as the orchestrated masterpiece of the game, but good nonetheless.<br /><br />I suppose if I were a few years younger I'd have been taken in by the sheer cool factor of this movie and the simple fact that it has the name Final Fantasy on it.  When I viewed this movie, though, it seemed to have forgotten what Final Fantasy is.  Final Fantasy always put an emphasis on storyline, this movie does not.  The games look beautiful but they at least maintain their story and character development while they're at it.  Advent Children seems to toss its characters and storyline aside.<br /><br />In the end it depends on what you're looking for.  If you're looking for a lot of action, beautiful cinematics and don't give a rip about story, characters or plot development, then Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is for you. If, however, you're looking for a well written script, story and plot development, as well as character development, Advent Children isn't for you.mixed with bad English voice overs doesn't help either (the most common line people bring up is Tifa's \\"Dilly dally shilly shally\\").   <br /> <br />The music score redeems some of it.

B000BTJDGC|3.0|Only in the postmodern era could a film of such content achieve notoriety as a \\"horror film\\".  \\"Emily Rose\\" is more an exercise on the ins and outs of religious faith within the framework of the American legal system than a horror movie, an interesting meditation on how belief in the metaphysical goes over in complicated situations like the tragic one depicted here. Having read about the actual case which really took place in Germany and did not for a second involve the Catholic Church, I thought it was a little distasteful that the director decided to suggest here and there that this might have been a real case of possession.<br /><br />As far as the movie itself goes, though, the meticulous construction and ill-fated plight of Emily Rose (Anneliese Michael) manages to entertain and even get a tad spooky here and there.  Needless to say, this only happens when the fictitious elements are added.  It is above all worth watching as a courtroom drama.  Tom Wilkinson is utterly forgettable as Father Moore and Jennifer Carpenter delivers a fairly convincing performance as Emily Rose in both her \\"normal\\" state and \\"possessed\\" state.<br /><br />Laura Linney and Campbell Scott, however, are phenomenal as two lawyers bent on both stealing the spotlight and proving each other wrong.  At times you really can't help but side with the prosecution, though, as Linney is clearly unprepared for the case despite her character's supposed voracious drive for victory.  How you could pull off an even tentative acquittal such as the one Moore receives at the end is beyond me in this particular case, but she manages it.<br /><br />For my part, I was not left with the desire to watch the film again and again.  Although the plotline was elaborate, coherent and gripping, I found the \\"exorcism\\" scenes ridiculously short and unconvincing.  What you are left with here is not a burning question as to whether Emily was really possessed or just epileptic, but tremendous pity for her psychological and physiological suffering.<br /><br />That said, this is worth watching.  Maybe some aspiring horror director will pick up on the good parts and make another actually frightening film about exorcism.ogical and physiological suffering.   <br /> <br />That said, this is worth watching.

B0000027DJ|5.0|This is my favorite Cooper album.  It has the greatest strongest material of any Metal album in my opinion.  It was made after he had had his 3 comeback albums of the 80's, this one was released in 1991 and starts off the new decade with a Golden Sound.  It's musically amazing with some of the greatest musicians as guests on it, and its Lyrically his best album.<br /><br />Lets look at the cd itself.<br /><br />Jewel Case, with a remastered pure cd. 5/5<br /><br />The Cover of the album is a really sweet photo for this cd, and the inside has a foldout of Alice in a sinister look, with Black Leather, and lyrics in it. The Photo of Alice is also on the back of the cd. 5/5<br /><br />Songs.<br /><br />Hey Stoopid - This is a Great Song with some amazing anti drug anti suicide lyrics and good music, and a great opener for this album 5/5<br /><br />Love's a Loaded Gun - This is a very Dramatic track with beautiful and sinister lyrics, and a mix of acoustic and electric guitar, It's like a dramatic balled. 5/5<br /><br />Snakebite - Another good song with a catchy guitar solo and riff, and decent lyrics. 5/5<br /><br />Burning Our Bed - A great balled to start off the 3 song story line, some amazing lyrics and music to back it up. 5/5<br /><br />Dangerous Tonight - The Dramatic part of the 3 song story, with great guitar and dramatic lyrics. 5/5<br /><br />Might As Well Be On Mars - The wrap up of the 3 song story, its a sad sad balled with beautiful music and lyrics, a gem without a doubt. 5/5<br /><br />Feed My Frankenstein - The only big \\"hit\\" from the album, its a tad overplayed but it still has good lyrics and an amazing guitar solo, Nikki Sixx basses on this album and that always makes it cool. 5/5<br /><br />Hurricane Years - Another good lyric song with catchy guitar sounds. 4/5<br /><br />Little By Little - A drastic song tribute to Alice's little sick things (fans) 5/5<br /><br />Die for You - Coopers best balled, BEAUTIFUL lyrics, and great music to back it up.5/5<br /><br />Dirty Dreams - A song about Teenage \\"dirty dreams\\" Alice returns to rebellion. 5/5<br /><br />Wind Up Toy - A good end to the album about some guy in a mental hospital. 5/5<br /><br />All in All this is Coopers musically Greatest album to date, its got very personal music, and the songs flow very well from one to another.<br /><br />Price 10 bucks.

B0000026T4|3.0|This album was mainly Alice Coopers comeback album that got him back on the popular seen.  I personally think the album itself does not have the Alice Cooper twist in it, but it has some of my favorite songs in it.  POISON - the song that reached # 7 in the u.s. is a great song, Spark in the Dark is another good one, and Bed Of Nails is just amazing.  The rest of the album is okay and occaisonally good. But it just has to many guests in it, that have taken over the album i'd recomend the album to people to listen to, but just know it's not really the Alice we love.
B0001611DI|5.0|\\"This movie is like Whatever!!!\\"  Do you know what the previous statement means?  It means that \\"horror\\" fans have forgotten the classics.  \\"Horror\\" fans have a need and craving for crap computer special effects, overly beautiful actors/actresses, crap stories and crap soundtracks like zombies have a craving for flesh.  The reason Hollywood keeps remaking classic horror films like this one is because idiots keep paying for them.  Instead of realizing that the story, acting and directing are rubbish you'll praise them because they have more cheap scares than Dean Koontz has cheap novels.  If you've given this movie a bad review then you obviously know nothing about horror, this is the best horror film of all time.  In fact, to me, this is the greatest film of all time, period.  To the people that don't like this movie, don't worry, I hear that there is a remake of Halloween that you can go see.  Who knows, maybe you'll get a new Scream movie soon.
0140120416|5.0|This book is great.<br /><br />Very great.<br /><br />It has what you need to know to get off of the ground. It goes through noun cases, adjectives, verbs, handwriting, participles, diminutives, superlatives... It has...what you need.<br /><br />It is small, compact. But friendly. If you get this book, you should start at the start, go through every chapter in order, and do all of the 'EXTRA' sections (sections where the author says it is not necessary to learn to be able to be understood). The only thing I don't think is really necessary is the handwriting part. But I encourage at least reading the chapter.<br /><br />If you learn Russian, you should be very strict on yourself. You almost have to be. Do every lesson, every example in the book, everything. After you are done with this, you should pick up \\"Schaum's Outline of Russian Grammar\\". That book is like a workbook. But also teaches you grammar. It has plenty of exercises to keep you up to par.<br /><br />As everyone else has said, do not buy this book expecting to be very good at Russian. You need (1) a dictionary, (2) a verb book, and (3) some kind of audio, like Pimsleur. (See my reviews on (1) and (2) for some information on books I have used.)<br /><br />You NEED audio. Though this book explains pronunciation - you probably won't get it unless you actually hear it. I recommend Pimsleur's audio courses. I am currently using those, one lesson a day. You learn pronunciation, some more vocabulary and sentence structure, and some speaking and listening skills.<br /><br />My only complaint is the quality of the construction of the book. I had it for a week or less, and the spine was already giving away. Granted, I did bring it with me to school and such - but I did take care of it. If you buy it, I recommend getting some of that clear packing tape, and covering the spine as well as each edge of the front and back. That works really well for me.

B0057UA486|5.0|Stanley Kubrick's 1975 epic Barry Lyndon was released in the nine years between two of his most well-known films, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining. With the exception of Spartacus, historically the only film he didn't have complete creative control over, Barry Lyndon at 184 minutes is the longest film Stanley Kubrick ever made. Upon its release, Barry Lyndon yielded underwhelming box-office returns and received a cool reception from critics. True of all the films Kubrick released between 1968 and his death in 1999, critics have warmed to the film and what was once considered his most underrated is now considered one of his best. Not bad for a film he only decided to make when he was unable to get his Napoleon film into production. This is a Kubrick film through-and-through, the second and final film he would write solo, although, like most of his films, it has a literary basis. Barry Lyndon is a film of many layers, a sweeping epic that moves in a hypnotic, dream-like way and in unafraid to poke fun at its subjects while taking itself seriously. Due to its length, it's one of the hardest Kubrick films to just sit down and absorb but it proves to be one of the most rewarding.  Barry Lyndon is made up of two parts and an epilogue, the latter consisting of only a title card. Part one, which lasts half of the running time, is sub-titled \\"By what means Redmond Barry acquired the style and title of Barry Lyndon.\\" The film relies heavily on classy, monotonous, omniscient narration performed by Michael Hordern and many events in the film are not even shown onscreen. The film begins in Ireland circa 1750 and introduces protagonist Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal), who has fallen in love for the first time with his cousin Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). When the snarling, insufferable John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) appears as Nora's suitor, Redmond challenges him to a duel that forces to him flee to Dublin and lay low for awhile. As the film is an \\"epic,\\" the viewer is invited to accompany Redmond from this point on through all the peaks and valleys of his life. He joins King George's army, becomes a deserter, and eventually ends up in the Prussian army. After the Prussian army sends Redmond to spy on the Chevalier de Balibari (Patrick Magee), Redmond becomes his aide and confidant and the two begin to build a fortune through gambling. Redmond eventually lays eyes on Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson), a countess whom he eventually seduces and marries after her husband's death. This leads to part two, \\"Containing an account of the misfortunes and disasters which befell Barry Lyndon,\\" in which Redmond, now known as Barry Lyndon, climbs the social ladder and welcomes a son, while feeding the hatred of Lady Lyndon's own son Lord Bullingdon (Leon Vitali).  It's impossible to summarize Barry Lyndon in only a few sentences, as it tells a rather expansive story over three hours. With all of the story arcs and events within this running time, the film isn't immediately gripping like Kubrick's other work and requires time and patience as it quietly sneaks up on you as it unfolds. It's pacing is elegant, moving with no hurry. The lack of that very specific, yet unexplainable Kubrickian tone sets Barry Lyndon apart from Kubrick's other films made between 1968 and 1999. There are scenes that play in that fascinating, Kubrickian way and scenes that film buffs can immediately identify as Kubrick, yet the absolute presence of the master is not as prominent. I've always found tone and atmosphere to be the most striking aspect of a Kubrick film, but the most striking thing here is the way it looks. Kubrick was always an artist in the way he used images yet this may be his most luxuriously shot, beautiful film. The film won Academy Awards for costume design, art direction, score, and cinematography, making it the Academy's most awarded Kubrick film. Even with his film undervalued, its beauty could not be ignored. Kubrick and cinematographer John Alcott worked hard to make sure the film didn't look like the typical lavish costume drama and opted to use as much natural and available light as possible. Not only is this technically innovative, but it's effectively dazzling as well. The lighting, something I rarely put much thought into, is used tremendously and adds in setting this film apart from others like it. Additionally, there is stunning picturesque scenery that never feels superficial or fake.  Due to strenuous shooting schedules (keeping in mind that principal photography for this film alone took 300 days); many actors have told horror stories about working with Kubrick. As a result, his eye for casting and his ability to direct actors to precisely capture the correct tone for their performance is often overlooked. While he was in much higher regard in the 1970s, it must have seemed like an odd choice even then to cast Ryan O'Neal in the title role. Redmond Barry is a fascinating character, the \\"hero\\" of a historical epic who remains a static character throughout and displays an emotional disconnect and indifference to the events that take place around him. Redmond expresses emotion, but seems so passive; almost mechanical. For all it lacks in emotion and charisma, O'Neal makes up for it with intensity. Vitali gives a marvelously austere and delicate performance that seems to go unmentioned in discussing this film. His character is one of the most dynamic and emotive of the film and many of his scenes are elevated by his performance. Bit parts without much screen time make significant impressions because of the casting, such as Leonard Rossiter as Quin. It would be easy to forget this character who appears so early in the film, but Rossiter's sneer and his aristocratic voice and posture make him unforgettable.   In the hands of another director, Barry Lyndon could be mind-numbingly dull, with style markedly overwhelming substance. That is never the case here. The duel between Barry Lyndon and Lord Bullingdon, for example, ismasterful in Kubrick's hands; a clumsier director could have turned it into bloated tedium. Barry Lyndon may not be the most iconic film in his repertoire, but it is a complete treasure. A stunning masterwork that hasn't aged a day, it's such a rich, detached, memorable, and cold film that stands as a true work of art.  GRADE: A
B000FVQYZY|5.0|Yes, this album is somewhat of a departure. But with talent this incredible, it thrills me to see them grow and experiment. I want them to take me on a new journey with each album, and this one does it. <br /> <br />Don't let the \\"different\\" idea frighten you away from this CD. It is brilliant and beautiful and you will be SORELY missing out if you avoid it just because you don't like your bands to change. Grow with Muse and see where they take you.
0345475674|5.0|I actually read this book for a class.  It's a novel, very enjoyable, but is also an excellent introduction to Roman life at the time of the eruption. At least one of the characters, Pliny, really lived, and the others seem real. A very enjoyable read.
B000B8QG22|2.0|the movie is good except this version has been editted and cut out sceens, very disapointting
0385513755|5.0|What can be said that hasn't been said a thousand times?  I am a latecomer to the Da Vinci hysteria.  First off, this book is worth every penny.  I read this book after the movie, and I think the book is better (even though the movie was good too).  You cannot read this book without having the photos to go along with the story line: Dan Brown - great edition!  I am using this book as a springboard to dive into the ancient world of knights templar, secret societies, etc. I usually don't go for fiction, however there is a lot of fact present here (religiously, and just pertaining to life) that one can learn from in this book.  How can you not enjoy the power, and intrigue of: \\"The Teacher\\", \\"The Priory\\", \\"The Templars\\" etc?  It brings to light the feeling I always had in watching the Godfather III, when Michael is having problems dealing with the Vatican.  There are people holding the strings in everyday life, religious groups, government, secret societies, the underworld, etc.  It makes you think...<br /><br />After reading this tale, I ordered a book on the knights and one on freemasons as well.  I plan on reading them as soon as they arrive.  Great book, and I had an enjoyable time reading this wonderful story.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|When The Cream broke up back in February 1969, Let it Be still was not yet a single, Nixon was in office for just one month, and most people alive today weren't.  Although the trio had made some sporadic, shortlived reunion gigs, it never felt like they really committed to a reformation.  There was too much history, too much pain and baggage.  There was one living video chronicle: the strange Farewell Concert that felt like a mediocre show, and one that was horribly mixed.  The idea was that although all three members were still alive (Unlike Hendrix, Jim Morrison, and half the Beatles) at least the mystery was there, better leave it alone.   <br /> <br />So doing what Clapton, Baker, and Bruce set out to do was a gamble on their legacy of 37 years.  You can tell from this DVD that they made quite sure (with abundant rehearsals) that they would not only not disappoint, but that they would somehow shine.  With little exception, their song renditions are solid, but not great.  There are instrumental jams, but they are never really long ones.   <br /> <br />What makes this DVD outstanding is the way it was recorded,  both visually and sonically:  the polar opposite of The Farewell Concert recorded back also at Albert Hall in 1969.  If you were always a fan of Cream, you just have to be glad it ever happened (Therefore, the first song is, of course, I'm So Glad).  It's almost as if the three of them gave a huge sigh of relief when it was all done.

1932100385|5.0|Colin Campbell presents an interesting insight into the difficulties and the rewards of providing the scientific facts without cultural, political, and economic bias.  He simply but powerfully provides the readers with an understanding about statistical signifigance and the dangerous flaws that exist when reductionist science is practiced. The book is foundational and is a must read for those researchers who will be investigating diseases such as Alzheimers and MS.  Colin Campbell is a revolutionary.  This is one of the most significant books of our time.
0226039331|5.0|This is the most comprehensive Lexicon of Koine Greek available. I like how for almost every word, the lexicon gives you an extensive list of how this word is used in not only the New Testament, but in some of the Christian literature of the post New Testament era.     It gives you the tense and voice and mood of words, and whether or not a verb is used passively or actively in a given verse. This is the pinnacle textbook for those who are exegeting and parsing the New Testament.    The only caveat I have is with the price. But even at $140, this book is still essential for a richly rewarding study of the New Testament for advanced students. But if you live near a seminary library, you'd almost be farther ahead to use the copy in the reference section.    But if you live in the boonies like me, this book is something you should get. You may want to buy the CD-ROM Version, it is very intuitive and easy to use, and best of all, it is run on the proprietary Libronix Digital Library System, the fastest and most seamless software engine available.
B00004RF9B|4.0|\\"Forbidden Planet\\" is one of the most influential science fiction movies of all time.  Unlike many of its contemporaries, the special effects are at least reasonable even today.  While so many science fiction movies relied on stories of alien races and monsters, this movie uses that type of story to complement what is a surprisingly good science fiction story.  This filmed debuted on March 15th of 1956 in the U.S., and subsequently became a classic of the genre.  It is pretty much impossible to watch a retrospective on science fiction movies without seeing scenes from this movie included.    This film introduced the world to Robby the Robot, and featured Walter Pidgeon as Doctor Edward Morbius, Anne Francis as his Altaira, Dr. Morbius' daughter, and Leslie Nielsen as Commander Adams.  It is a little odd seeing Leslie Nielsen in a serious role after all the comedies that he has done in the later part of his career, but he does a decent enough job.  You will likely recognize some of the other actors in this movie as well, such as Warren Stevens and Richard Anderson.  The story involves the ship's personnel learning about the horrible fate of the other colonists, followed by the crew facing the same horrible force.  The story combines action with a more thoughtful story, which undoubtedly has more to do with this movie becoming a classic than anything else.     While overall it is a good science fiction story, they do make some ridiculous scientific choices along the way.  The spaceship design is very questionable, with three staircases for exit or entry and no airlocks.  There is also the absurdity of needing to take the ship apart in order to contact their base when things turn out to be different than what they expected.  Those things only detract a little from the overall movie though, and when compared with most of its contemporaries they are very small problems.  The story also mixes is some humor more so than some of the other films.  Earl Holliman as the cook offers some humorous moments in his attempts to get Robbie to produce Bourbon, and then there is my favorite exchange between Altaira and Robbie:       Altaira: \\"Robbie, I must have a new dress, right away.\\"     Robbie:  \\"Again?\\"    Those who know Star Trek, particularly the original series will find themselves on familiar ground in this movie, as it clearly had a huge influence on the show.  From the premise of a United Planets Cruiser, to some of the design in the ships, to the similarity in storyline with several of the episodes, there can be no doubt that this movie had a big impact on Gene Roddenberry.  You will find plot elements of this movie in the pilot episode \\"The Cage\\", as well as \\"What Are Little Girls Made Of\\", and \\"Requiem for Methuselah\\".  Other episodes of Star Trek, as well as other series, may well have taken other ideas from this movie as well.    The DVD is fairly bare bones, but it does offer standard and widescreen versions of the movie, one on each side.  Other than that, the only extras are the theatrical trailer and language choices.  Don't let the lack of extras deter you though, this is one worth watching.

B000002GQE|2.0|I have and love this on vinyl, and I have bought it twice on CD for the sake of convenience. Both sound like they were recorded off the vinyl, through the speakers!  The fidelity is just not there; on some of the cuts, namely (Evening) Time To Get Away, one track is missing entirely -- half of two-part harmony.  Guess you don't notice it unless you had the original album, but I can't listen to 'em.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Without the gigantic budget and hokey acting. Great acting, superb writing, great directing, enough special effects for any sci-fi fan. Why didn't sci-fi fans wake up to this movie?? Serenity continues where the Firefly TV show left off. You don't really need the TV series for this movie, but it's good to know the characters and the 'verse that started it all. I'll go ahead and contradict myself: Buy Firefly too!!!!!!<br />I recently purchased the Collector's Edition DVD. The movie itself is the same, but it looks brighter and cleaner. Most importantly, the film has been given a wonderful DTS 5.1 surround sound soundtrack. Now it is complete! The second disc has all the additional info that makes DVD sets so awesome. Highly recommended.

B000EULJLU|5.0|It was Tool's grinding guitars, pounding drums, and anger-laden lyrics in their debut album Opiate that helped the band gain recognition throughout the metal community in the early 90's.  Shortly after this 6 song EP, the band somewhat refined it's rigid style for their first full length debut, titled Undertow.  After this highly successful release, Tool's next album titled Aenima took on a more progressive approach, experimenting with distorted lyrics and powerful underlying bass lines (due to the band's new bassist, Justin Chancellor).  After a five year absence, the band released Lateralus which eclipsed all other work that they had previously released.  It pushed the envelope of progressive metal to places it had never been before, featuring extremely complex musical time changes, and an impeccable blending of vocals, drums, guitar and bass.  After this release, rumors had surfaced that the band had broken up, leaving many of their highly devoted fans to wonder if they would ever get their next \\"fix\\" of Tool's revolutionary music.  On May 2, 2006, five years after the bands previous release, their fans cries were answered as Tool released its fourth full-length album titled \\"10,000 Days.\\"  Although some of their new material has a familiar sound, much of this work is very different from anything Tool has done in the past.   <br /> <br />Yet 10,000 Days is another powerhouse in the realm of progressive metal.  This is clearly evident in the band's opening track Vicarious, which features wonderfully sinister vocals and an incredibly harmonizing guitar-bass intro.  Jambi is a similar rocker that features powerful guitar work (including a talk box solo), but its rhythm isn't quite as addictive as its predecessor.  Wings For Marie follows, which functions more as a segue to its big brother song, 10,000 Days (Wings part 2).  This is a touching song that showcases tranquil lyrics and another complex blending of the sounds of all four band members, much like the following song.  The Pot is a lyrically driven song that shows the full range of lead singer Maynard James Keenan's incredible voice, similar to a song on Undertow..  Lipan Conjuring is a short, tribal type song that acts as a short intermission between the first and second halves of the album.  Lost Keys (Blame Hofmann) is an interlude featuring a doctor and nurse dialogue that leads into Rosetta Stoned.  At over eleven minutes long, this powerful rocker blends distorted lyrics, crunching guitar riffs, and intricate drum sequences, sounding somewhat like an Aenima era Tool song.  Intension follows, which is a very mellow, experimental song very similar to Disposition and Reflection on Tool's previous release, Lateralus, yet leaves much to be desired .  Musically, the band closes with an addictive, catchy song called Right in Two.  This song shows the brilliance and amazing dexterity of drummer Danny Carey, featuring a long drum solo midway through the song.  This is another song that shows the amazing harmony between guitarist Adam Jones and bassist Justin Chancellor.  Viginti Tres is more filler that uses a zapping sound and a creepy voice to aptly close out this epic album.  <br /> <br />10,000 Days is just that, an epic album.  Although many people will dismiss this album as sub-par, stating that it isn't quite like the album that the listener liked most, whichever that may be.  When looked at as a completely new album unlike anything Tool has previously done before, listeners will see that 10,000 Days is destined to be another revolutionary album in progressive metal. <br />

B000059XUI|4.0|The first Superman film was ground-breaking both in its effects and its faithful re-telling of the Superman mythos, yet it suffered from an abrupt ending that left you wanting more just as they got to the really good stuff. Superman II was the answer to that problem.<br /><br />Most of this film was shot together with Superman I, but Donner was fired during production, and Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, and John Williams also left (though Hackman's footage was included, and Williams' theme was still used). Richard Lester was hired to re-shoot key scenes to strip Donner of his director's credit, and the result is a film that borders on great because it's hard to mess up a story essentially in the can, but uneven because of the tedious new comedic scenes and plot holes left by the fiasco. It was truly a shame, because here you had everything a comic fan wanted: Superman finally romancing Lois Lane, and an all-out battle with Kryptonian supervillains. Terance Stamp entered pop culture with his \\"Kneel before Zod!\\" line in this film. How can you not love that?<br /><br />Fortunately, legal issues have now been settled, and a confirmed \\"Donner cut\\" of Superman II is slated for release in a few months. This includes restored Christopher Reeve footage, and the lost footage of Marlon Brando. This theatrical cut is also getting a special edition as well.<br /><br />Superman II has always been painful for fans in terms of \\"what could've been,\\" and now 30 years later WB is making it happen. A great film just got better. And Chris Reeve flies again as Superman.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Hi, my name is laurie, and I am a Gilmore-aholic.  I love this show.  How is it that this show or any of the actors from it are never up for any serious awards?  I guess some things just can't be answered.  The run-down of this season?  Luke & Lorelai get together, then break-up, then get back together.  Rory dates Dean, meets Logan, breaks up with Dean, gets together with Logan, gets arrested, drops out of school.  And, of course, there are a lot of other stories happening with all the supporting cast-mates.  My favorite season to date.  Funny, touching, and worth every single penny. :)
B0000524E5|3.0|You don't often get movies with typical \\"chick flick\\" plots that also pander to guys with hot girls strutting around showing off their body. Coyote Ugly does it, and does a decent job of pulling it off. It's not a great film, but it's worth a viewing with your boy/girlfriend, whatever the case may be. The unrated version unfortunately spoils the balance a bit by throwing in bits of nudity. Do you really want that in a sugary date flick? Probably not. Stick to the theatrical cut, and you might find yourself humming \\"Can't Fight the Moonlight\\" as well.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond has managed to condense in a few hundred pages several powerful arguments about the differences in development between continents and people. The basic argument is that the ultimate causes which led to the divergent courses of the different peoples in our time had to do with food, geographical factors such as the orientation of the axes on each continent and immunity from disease conferred upon farmers. These in turn led to the development of writing, technology, government and guns, which were the proximate causes of the West's ascendancy in the last 500 years of so. <br /> <br />As a Christian, I do not agree with the theory of evolution so I could not agree with Diamond's take on prehistory, but I do agree with his arguments about the advantages that farming gave over the hunter-gatherer lifestyle or the importance of domesticable animals to development on the different continents. It is by this careful building of `irrefutable' argument upon `irrefutable' argument that makes his theory quite plausible. <br /> <br />One problem with his theory however, is that it leaves humans on the periphery of history. He acknowledges the role that several historical giants have played but considers their impact on history to be minor. Is this so though? Has not Hitler had a major effect on subsequent history, did not Ceasar? and what of the Pharaohs? This and his classification of several peoples into different racial groups than one would expect are two small matters that I took issue with.  <br /> <br /> Apart from the above, I found the book to be worth the time invested in reading it. Diamond brings a fresh perspective on our understanding of the world we live in and his clear style of writing makes this work highly readable. Definitely a must read. <br />
B00000IQMT|5.0|This isn't the full soundtrack, but it's got the majority of the important cues, and more importantly the most memorable ones. There was also an Ultimate 2-Disc set that was released, but that one felt like it was ripped directly from the film, complete with edits and jumps in the music. Here the music is presented as stand-alone pieces, the way it was probably written and the way it should be.<br /><br />As a movie, Phantom Menace left a lot to be desired, but John Williams scored once again with his compositions. Put Jar Jar Binks out of your mind and let Williams take you back with his mixture of new and old themes. The music was always the emotional heart of any Star Wars film.<br /><br />I have the Ultimate Edition for completion purposes, but this is still the disc I listen to more as it collects all the best parts and is easier to listen to on the go. A must have for all Star Wars fans and great for anyone looking for an epic, rousing score.
B00005JP4U|5.0|Saturday I saw Al Gore's movie, \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\"   See this powerful movie!  Based on a lecture warning people about global warming, Gore's passion to make people understand what is at stake is heartening. <br /> <br />In his dry, matter-of-fact manner, Gore takes on the Bush administration for a deliberate misinformation campaign to confuse people about global warming.  I doubt that anyone would even attempt to refute Gore after seeing all the evidence he has presented so clearly.  If we continue our present deadly inaction to address these concerns, we can no longer plead innocence after seeing this movie.   <br /> <br />Gore's passionate concern about the state of our planet comes through as he shares moments in his personal life that have shaped his commitment to saving our ozone layer.  He makes a compelling case, also, that we must end all warfare.  I literally basked in his words, loving every minute of this movie as Gore said everything that I've been saying for years. <br /> <br />If I had the means, I would cross the Arctic and Antarctic the way Gore did, to see for myself the extent of global warming on the icecaps.  The footage he shares of glaciers calving, receding, crevassing, and other manners of disappearing, satisfied me completely.  No questions left - we are in a serious planetary crisis with global warming and we must do something about it.   <br /> <br />I support Gore fully in creating the necessary political will to take all the steps he suggests for people to change the way we live to minimize global warming. - Ariel Ky
B000GFRDN6|5.0|finally A Steve Miller DVD/CD combo worthy of his greatness. I have always had a softspot for Steve in my soul. There is just something about his music that makes sit back and go ahhhh. He has a laid back mellow feel while still being able to rock out big time. A rare combination indeed. I enjoyed every minute of this superb CD/DVD. The interview section was very interesting<br /><br />to get insight into Steve and his composing process. The concert on DVD is great and covers a great deal of his material of the life of his output. I find the sound, camera work, and production all well done. Any fan of Steve Miller can not afford to miss this snap shot of where Steve miller Came from, and where he is at 30 years later.
0553213105|5.0|What do books do for me that nothing else does? The most important encounter that I have with books is that I identify myself with all the characters in the book. I see all the nuances of those characters as present in me. I experience all those experiences and I am not the same after that. I cannot remain unscathed. I have evolved into a greater human being. I have climbed another rung in the ladder of spiritual evolution. One book that I enjoy every time I read it is Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". The book is the baby of a literary genius. The most compelling feature of the book is its non-violence. At no point is there any harshness. Of course, we must consider the period in which it was written. English was most poetic even in prose. Given that credit, the novel refuses to show anyone in bad light at the end of it. All of human frailties are shown as natural and well, human! Neither Mr. Darcy is the villain nor is Mr. Wickham.  Each person is a consequence of the experiences he has had in his life. Jane Austen treats every character with gentleness. There is an understanding that every human being functions only within the level of awareness he/she has. That is the appeal of the novel. This is the kind of work Walt Whitman would have been proud of.

076531178X|5.0|Mistborn: The Final Empire is a fast-paced adventure with some fun characters, combining political intrigue with magical battles.  The characters are interesting and the plot takes some unexpected turns.<br /><br />The magic system is, perhaps, the element (pun intended, as you'll soon understand) that stands out most in the novel. Too often, the magic used in fantasy novels tends to either follow some rather stereotypical rules (casting verbal [often rhyming or using an ancient language] spells, potions, etc.) or to lack much in the way of discernable rules at all.<br /><br />In the world of Mistborn, the magic system is based on swallowing certain metals that are then \\"burned\\" to provide the particular power granted by that metal. It means that in the strictest sense, the number of things that can be done with magic is limited by the less than a dozen known allomantic metals. (For example, pushing metal away is one power, and pulling metal toward you is another.) But by ingenious use of the various metals, Mistborn allomancers can do a lot of different things.<br /><br />This is the first book of a trilogy, but fortunately it works well as a standalone novel as well. I've come to dislike being left hanging off a cliff at the end of a book.
B000GUJHD0|5.0|Dont know whether it's the book title or the popularity of the \\"The World is Flat\\" or what, many reviewers make direct comparison between the two and downplay this one, influenced by the author's extensive elaboration on abundance, Asia and automation as the driving force behind a shift from left brain style thinking (logic, sequence, literalness and analysis) to right brain one (synthesis, emotional expression, context and the big picture). IMHO, despite the similarities, the writings on the functioning of our brain and the six aptitudes (design, story, symphony, empathy, play, meaning) preached by the author to be the key dependents of any future professional success really are thought provoking or even mind blowing!

B00008OLYN|5.0|Extraordinary.  That is the first word that comes to mind when I think of Opeth's \\"Damnation,\\" the band's seventh full-length release, and one that is worlds removed from its forerunners.  Gone are the hammering, deafening riffs that have become synonymous with Opeth.  Absent is the guttural roar of singer Mikael Akerfeldt, another signature facet of the group.  Yes, in many ways, this album seems nothing like any of its predecessors.  And yet, the album is more similar to them than one might expect.  Though its presentation is different, the material here is straight in line with the melancholy, ominous musings that have populated the band's repertoire on past releases.  Only Opeth could make an album this mellow sound this menacing.  In many ways, this sense of dread and apprehension is what makes the disc so comforting.  This is a band that has not lost contact with its roots, but chooses to express them in a separate manner.  Thus, the listener is drawn into Opeth's world of foreboding, set to the effective musical backdrop of lullaby-like placidity.  \\"Windowpane\\" sets the mood well.  An acoustic-sounding riff that lures you in gently then catches you off guard with the eerie content of its lyrics is the nature of this particular beast, one which rears its head on several occasions throughout \\"Damnation.\\"  Standout songs, which are hard to choose considering the superb quality of every single note that makes up this album, include the Eastern-tinged \\"Closure,\\" a rare occasion of musicality and lyrical concept mutually reflecting, its companion piece \\"Hope Leaves,\\" a simple yet complex showcase of brilliant melodicism, and the instrumental or, as Akerfeldt himself says, \\"total ripoff of the band Camel\\" song \\"Ending Credits.\\"  But the other songs are wonderful as well.  \\"In My Time of Need\\" is a well-orchestrated exercise in staccato vocals, offset by a chorus that for some strange reason reminds me of the mellower music of Sir Elton John.  \\"To Rid the Disease\\" proves, as Akerfeldt puts it, that \\"just because a song is mellower doens't make it any less evil.\\"  Amen to that, especially when the song in question is such a memorable piece of work regardless.  And who can forget the Porcupine Tree frontman Stephen Wilson-penned song \\"Death Whispered a Lullaby,\\" perhaps the most subtly sinister piece found on this album, though the creepily synth-laced closer \\"Weakness\\" is another contender for that title.  All in all, \\"Damantion\\" is an exercise in paradoxical beauty, from its music to its artwork.  Everything seems a little creepier now than it would have been had this album been overtly heavy in its execution and presentation.  The players all bring to their roles a sort of wizened professionalism seldom present in music, much less heavy metal.  Singer / guitarist Akerfeldt and guitarist Peter Lindgren keep the album flowing with a laid-back yet visceral sense of melody and pacing.  Martin Mendez and Martin Lopez, on bass and percussion, respectively, back the guitars with a rhythmic precision unmatched.  And all parties manage to add gentle nuances to their performances.  As such, \\"Damnation\\" is somewhat of an anomaly in the metal portfolio.  It is hard to belive that such a soft-spoken disc could be so powerful.  But that is the very essence of Opeth; they can bend and not break and become all the more powerful for it.  \\"Damnation\\" is not a flawless album, but it is just about as close to divine as music can get.

0066620996|3.0|All too often a message has promise, but the messenger misinterprets it. That is often the case with this book, partly due to the author's thoroughness in introducing his first concept of `getting the right things/people in the right places'. This concept is so extensively covered in the first half of the book that, I believe, most people assume this continues into the second part of the book and quit reading. (Or, this is enough to make conversation around an executive lunch table and so they drop it for another hot conversation topic.) <br /> <br />In fact, the second part is significantly different and discusses what happens once everything is in place... momentum. Since most read the first half of the book and quit, I will cover the second half first. <br /> <br />Momentum and incremental improvements are the key to `radical breakthroughs', which, if done right, can not be recognized until well after they happen. This hurts the quick-fix consultants out there, but there is no effective way to have long lasting impact with a significant shift of direction. A quick shift requires readjustment by everybody and does not put an organization on stable ground to continue their momentum. Rather, small changes will amass into a significant step at some point but none of these alone will change the playing field or greatly move organizations position in it. <br /> <br />Most important about this is FOCUS, each of these changes comes with understanding the world around you but focusing on how you can make a difference. The problem comes when the scope of vision becomes to wide and, marketing is concerned with the testing results the QA department got on beta build 3, support is talking about who in sales is making their quota and sales is talking about where the executive team held their last off-site. Keeping each team focused on contributing toward the goal and feeling the energy build as they make progress is the key. <br /> <br />Now for the first part, get resources where they belong, even if this includes placing them in the trash. Collins describes an organization as a bus. First, get the right people you need for the journey on the bus, get the wrong people off. Yes, there are some people who are not right for the organization, it would be a disservice to the others on the team and hurt that person's future if you did not help them get off the bus. Second, put the right people in the right seats. Great! Now that everybody is where their skills are best applied look at the tools you have and do the same. If the ticket system is garbage, replace it with something that meets your needs, money spent now will save you operating costs in the future. Monitoring application working adequately, find somebody who can make it work right. <br /> <br />If you are going to read this book, commit to reading the entire book, it can be worth it. The misinterpretation of G2G is partly the fault of the media, which enjoys sensationalizing that Jim Collins is advocating firing people that are not immediate contributors to the team and a fit for the culture. So learn about momentum and be comfortable with your organization not holding huge release parties for new products and be able to look back and say, `I was part of something great.'
0071373586|4.0|As an MBA student I found this book to be of great help with respect to appreciating the power of marketing from a practical approach.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I don't understand why this movie was not even considered to be  shown in American movie theaters. Same in Europe. It only hit the Big Screen in Asia. In America and Europe did it go right onto DVD this April (2006). Did they fear that the movie will do bad in the Box Office as \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits within\\" did in 2001?<br /><br />The Spirits within became a big success on DVD and the \\"flop\\" in the Box Office can only be explained by bad marketing. The same is true for the latest FF Movie, Advent Children. I didn't even know it existed until July 2006.<br /><br />I bought the DVD on the spot without thinking. I played several of the FF Games on the PC and PS2 and know the previous Movie. I loved all of them and know I couldn't do anything wrong. Of course I was right.<br /><br />FF7 - Advent Children is a great movie, very fast paste and not for everybody. If you don't like Final Fantasy or Fantasy (the genre) in General, this Movie is probably NOT FOR YOU. If you are a FF Player and like the Game Series, this Movie is a MUST buy.

I only own their first cd before this one and all I know is that it totally rocked and comparing those 2 cds their self titled cd kicks this one across the floor.

I cannot convey the impact this movie, and it's predecessor television series Firefly, has had on how I view modern cinema.  The writing is FANTASTIC and the acting INCREDIBLE!  The suttle grittiness of humanity displayed on screen; something rarely seen outside of movies such as Raging Bull or any monologue given by Steve Buscemi. I just hope that this movie will show everyone just how special this show really was...and maybe allow us to experience more.  Please see the entire Firefly boxset prior to watching the movie.

B000002UAU|5.0|\\"Paul is dead now, miss him, miss him, miss him.\\"  This line from Revolution number nine, introduced me to Beatles music, eventually leading me to my favorite Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, circa 1967.  If symbolism, or even a potential cover up, is something one finds of interest, then this is the album to buy and tear apart.  The price is right, being that this album is now old, affording you the opportunity to purchase the other albums that continue the Paul McCartney Mystery.   <br /> Cutting Edge for their day, the Beatles has become mainstream in modern times.   Their use of different Middle Eastern instruments has had a huge influence in the music of their day, and can still be seen in today's popular music.  Nowadays, we look back at the Beatles' music and it does not look so revolutionary; what we have to remember is that this was during the sixties and they were actually taking huge leaps in their style of music.  To add a backwards tracks and sampling from other audio performances was unheard of before they attempted it.   <br /> My first experience with this album was in a high school class, and had it not been introduced this way I would have laid it to the wayside.  That was not the case; in our English class, we were looking for hidden symbols in the music and in the album art; of course the Beatles were rich in both of these.  Take the lyric, \\"I am the Walrus,\\" (Magical Mystery Tour track #6); nothing too interesting there, right?  That is until one realizes that the walrus is a symbol of death in some cultures.  This then made me look at Abbey Road; why is Paul the only one not wearing any shoes?   Oh, this can go on and on, for days and days, but once I realized these little things in the albums, they became masterpieces of hidden messages.  The remaining Beatles to this day deny any messages hidden in their works, saying that it is just fictitious ramblings of a bored radio host.  No matter which camp the fans are in, this is a thoroughly enjoyable album, combining elements from many different cultures, with a new way of presentation.  An album then becomes a continuing work in process, expressing the constant evolution of a band. <br /> Some of the most interesting tracks of the album include track #1, Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and the final track #13, A Day In The Life.  In Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band we are introduced to Billy Shears; the lyrics start as follows,  <br />  It was twenty years ago today/ <br />   Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play/ <br />   They've been going in and out of style/ <br />   But they're guaranteed to raise a smile/ <br />   So may I introduce to you/ <br />   the act you've known for all these years/ <br />   Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band/ <br />In the beginning, they are introducing the band the audience already knew, so why then at the end of the song they say this?   <br />  I don't really want to stop the show/ <br />  but I thought that you might like to know/ <br />  that the singer's going to sing a song/ <br />  and he wants you all to sing along/ <br />  So let me introduce to you/ <br />  the one and only Billy Shears/ <br /> Why was he introduced?  Paul McCartney is the one singing the song, right?  Well that answer is not for me to tell; that is something to be thought over and figured out.  With that question in mind, is the singer an imposter or this is just a joke? <br /> Now track #13 is where the hard thinking comes in; there are many stories that this song is supposed to about, though believers in the hoax say that this song refers to how Paul McCartney died.   <br />  I read the news today oh boy/ <br />  about a lucky man who made the grade/ <br />  and though the news was rather sad/ <br />  Well I just had to laugh/ <br />  I saw the photograph/ <br />  He blew his mind out in a car/ <br />  He didn't notice that the lights had changed/ <br />  A crowd of people stood and stared/ <br />  they'd seen hisface before/ <br />  No one was really sure if he was from the house of lords/ <br /> This is said to be referring to how he died, in a car crash, with a fatal head injury.  The rest of this song is filled with interesting clues for conspiracy theorists, with many sayings left open for interpretation. <br /> So, when a band has a great opener and a great closer, fans will tend to forget things that did fit in with your story.  I give kudos to the Beatles for creating the first real theme album.  The only track that lets this album down is track # 11 Good Morning, Good Morning.  It first seems to be thrown in there, interrupting the fluid progression of this album with an abrupt \\"Good Morning, Good Morning.\\"  Even hoax enthusiasts have this point of view; there is very little contribution to the hoax, other than the lyric, <br />  \\"Nothing has changed it's still the same.\\" <br />This is John speaking, is he trying to lead us astray or is he stating that all of this is in fun?   <br /> The Beatles are timeless; any music lover would enjoy listening to the progression of their music.  Today's music has been profoundly affected by the advancements and chances the Beatles took with there music.  For example, sampling became a regular thing to do in the seventies, and in the eighties Hair Metal bands, like Gun-N-Roses used orchestras on some of their songs.  Therefore, every time we hear something unique musically, we should thank the pioneers who helped start it all. <br />

B000EHSVQ4|5.0|A great and beautiful movie, with good actors, wonderful sets and landscapes, deep story that avoids the usual clichés about a difficult subject. Of course, the director's cut is much better than the theater version, giving more time to the story and characters. You must see it at once.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I have truly been enjoying this album. I am a long time fan of both artists and together they are much like peanut butter and chocolate. Great on their own, but amazing together. <br /> <br />No seriously, it is really great from top to bottom and is one of those albums you can just turn on and listen through without having to skip any songs in between.  <br />Indeed a masterpiece!
B000002JEV|5.0|Though these recordings are not a truly live concert (and there is probably a flashing \\"APPLAUD\\" sign for the audience), it is still amazingly brilliant.  Robert's singing was especially deep, raunchy, and emotional.  The version of \\"Thank You\\" is the absoulute best version EVER...the solo is absoulutely saccharine on electric guitar, nothing like the studio version on Led Zeppelin II, which is acoustic.  There are 2 \\"Dazed & Confused\\" versions, but I should hope that any Zeppelin fan prefers the longer one, with the violin bow solo and all.  What is really unique and enthralling about the 18-min or so version of \\"Dazed & Confused\\" is that the solo is enchanting and eerie...because there is no screaming crowd to interrupt, and the dead silence of the entire place allows the solo to be very echoey and very mysterious, like Pagey himself.      \\"The Immigrant Song\\" has defintitely been served its justice on this album, more rock-able than the studio version for SURE!  And one of my favorite things about the song \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" is that during the song's ending, while Robert sings, \\"Everybody I know seems to know me well but they really didn't know that I move like...\\" he changes \\"move\\" to something else...haha I shall leave you in suspense.  It's quite cute really, and will make you laugh if you pay attention.  And even though there are two versions of \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" how can anyone not like the medley version, which is extremely bluesy, thanks to the incorporation of \\"Boogie Chillun\\" and \\"That's Alright Mama?\\"    One last thing I would like to point out is that the versions of \\"Going to California\\" and \\"That's the Way\\" are very serene versions.  They do not sound like the studio versions, but that's what's so nice about them; they are a different side to the songs.  The mandolin is more prominent in \\"Going to California.\\"  Also, \\"That Girl I Love She Got Long Black Wavy Hair\\" is absent from any studio album and it's a groovy blues song with a raunchy riff.    \\"BBC Sessions\\" is a most enjoyable album and I highly recommend it to all fans...but if you are a more wilder fan that needs to hear them live n' loud you should try \\"How the West Was Won\\" instead.  It is one of the few sources we have of Zeppelin captured live, and each song is different than the next.  Don't miss out on Percy, Pagey, Jonesy, and Bonzo doing what they do best!  YOU DON'T KNOW ZEPPELIN TILL YOU'VE HEARD 'EM LIVE!!!
0679409998|3.0|Dr. Frankenstein goes off to London to receive an education and discovers his love of science.  His first experiment is to create a life from parts.  He assembles a creature by which even he is repulsed.  Frankenstein's nightmare is fully realized when the creature's eyes first blink and he realizes that his experiment worked.  He flees the apartment only to find it empty upon his return.  But despite Frankenstein's initial thoughts that his problem has taken leave on it's own, he finds himself hunted by the wretched creature.  The Monster is seeking a companion, finding himself alone because of society's repulsion to his outward appearance.  He proposes a solution to his creator.  Create him a companion, or he will take the lives of Frankenstein's friends and family leaving him with the feelings of loneliness and isolation.  The Doctor must now decide which horror is worse - to create another of these monsters or to risk the lives of himself and his loved ones.<br /><br />For years I was under the false impression that Frankenstein was the monster himself, not the creator.  Further, after seeing brief parts of the movie with Robert De Niro, I had further misconceptions about the true story.  But Mary Shelley's actual text is a story about human emotion, making difficult life and death choices, and emotional isolation and loneliness - the desire for true companionship.<br /><br />The difficulty with reading classics like this today is that the language is difficult to get through even for advanced readers.  Writing style has evolved so much over the centuries and the old style is not to be faulted, but it does take dedication and patience for those not accustomed to it.  Nonetheless, it is a story worth reading and the original deserves notoriety, more so that common and modern misconceptions.
B00002E23E|5.0|No other film could have captured the grandeur of Led Zeppelin and incorporated an insight on the band members and their adventures and personalities than \\"The Song Remains the Same.\\"  Even if you were not a wild child of the 70's (like myself), you got the feel of the times and the concert, and the emotions of the audience leaked through onto you.  It is my favorite movie, because there is nothing I love more than Led Zeppelin.  I laughed, danced, and cried through out this film.    The film starts out oddly with Richard Cole in a mob scene and Peter Grant getting tour dates, but is a quiet transition into what the picturesque daily lives of all 4 members are...and it is truly sweet.  For example, Robert is with his kids and wife, as is Jonesy, Bonzo is farming, and Jimmy is playing a hurdy-gurdy in a lovely autumn setting.  But you totally feel the love and overall high of New York City in the 1970's, venturing through out subway tunnels and skyscraping buildings...to the sounds of Zeppelin LIVE!!    Each band member has their own scene in which their \\"theme\\" song, if you will,is performed and each of them get to be a little dramatic through amateur acting (and they don't do half bad...but their musical performance is a million times better!).  The members and their songs are as follows, along with a brief description of the scene :    \\"No Quarter\\"-John Paul(A dark horseback rider [Jonesy] in the night, playing a church organ)  \\"Dazed and Confused\\"-Pagey(Mysterious and insane things that REALLY make you think about your own life)  \\"The Rain Song\\"-Robert(Dramatic LOTR type acting...but very daring)  \\"Moby Dick\\"-Bonzo(The maniac himself doing his best)    It is a lenghthy movie, but if you are a true fan you will not get bored.  It is so natural, and the concert spectacular, for this is Zeppelin at their peak.  I HIGHLY recommend it, before any concert movie by ANY artist.
0786838655|5.0|Percy Jackson is a troubled twelve year old. He is currently taking classes at Yancy Academy, a private school for troubled kids in New York. He suffers from ADHD and dyslexia, his short attention span always getting him into trouble. His Mother is married to a sadistic man after the death of his real father at sea, whom Percy had never known. His best friend, Grover, is also a troubled kid, suffering from many of the same problems, and on top of it he has a crippled gait he must deal with thanks to a muscular ailment in his legs.<br /><br />One day when Percy's class is on a field trip Percy encounters something odd. His math teacher, Mrs. Dodds, suddenly turns into a strange winged creature and attacks him. He manages to fend her off with a sword that materializes out of the ballpoint pen of his other teacher, Mr. Brunner. But the strange things do not stop, on the way home the bus breaks down and Percy sees a strange sight of three women cutting a string of yarn with scissors. This sight unnerves Grover and haunts Percy for some time.<br /><br />When summer break comes Percy finds he will not be returning to Yancy and goes home to be with his mom and cruel stepfather, Gabe. Percy mother surprises him with a trip upstate, which ends in disaster when the two are attacked by a creature that resembles the Greek myth of the minotaur. In the attack a horrible fate befalls Percy's mother, and Percy manages to break a horn from the minotaur before slaying him. Clutching the horn in his hands he follows Grover, who has suddenly appeared, to a place that his mother was aiming him towards before he collapses in exhaustion.<br /><br />Waking up some strange revelations come to Percy. He is in a summer camp for people called half bloods, or demigods, and it is there he realizes the truth of his parentage. His father is one of the gods, which one though is undetermined. Grover is also a satyr yearning to earn his searcher's license to find his god, Pan, who has been missing for centuries.  Percy also meets a young girl named Annabeth, 14, who tells him she is the daughter of Athena, and a 19 year old councilor named Luke who is the son of Hermes. Mr. D. (Dionysus) is a teacher at Half Blood Hill and Percy receives the biggest shock of all when he discovers that his teacher, Mr. Brunner, is not only the infamous Chiron, trainer of Hercules, but also a centaur.<br /><br />Something nasty is brewing in the realm of the gods. Zeus' master thunderbolt has gone missing, which bodes ill for the world seeing as how it has more destructive capability than a thousand nuclear bombs. Zeus blames Hades, lord of the underworld, for it and prepares for war between him and his other brother, Poseidon. It is then that the secret of  Percy's birth is revealed, and then also that a quest is given to him. He must retrieve the master bolt before the summer solstice, or the world is literally going to erupt into World War III. With Grover and Annabeth at his side he sets off to do just this.<br /><br />This book was such a breath of fresh air. A great exciting read. It has all of the elements of a bestseller and a blockbuster film (which the book has already been optioned for, as I see from IMDB). It is action packed and thrilling, and yet is chock full of heart, which will certainly endear many readers to this series. I was also amazed at how Riordan cleverly wove details of Greek mythology into the history of the world, specifically that of  the 20th century.  The explanation about how the gods were involved in World War II was nothing shy of brilliant. And the ending, how Riordan sets up the over arching plotline, is tremendous and makes me need to read the next book immediately.<br /><br />I know that this series is already doing well, and I have even heard it compared to Harry Potter... but the magnitude of the storylines, the depth of the characters, the strength of the dialogue, and the impact of the surprise ending will have readers thinking more of aboy named Percy than of Harry. In my estimation, this is the series to stand in line at midnight booksellings for...even though Potter is a phenomenon, Percy is a legend. Literally.<br /><br />\\"His eyes were sympathetic, but sad.  \\"You will be a great hero, child. I will do my best to prepare you. But if I'm right about the path ahead of you...The gods have their reasons, Percy. Knowing too much of your future is never a good thing.\\"aders thinking more of a boy named Percy than of Harry.

078322737X|5.0|This movie accurately depicts the era that was one of good times without drugs and rap (gutter) music. Times have changed just as people change but it is great to return to the memories of a time before lowered standards, outsourcing, being politically correct and illegal aliens. Thanks for the memories and an excellent movie.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Same great stories, shame about the change in some characters from the first series but I guess we will get used to them. Still some more to look at but so far, excellent!
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album is worth 5 stars! and deserves to be, all thoughs giving this a 1 star are insane, don't you have ears? <br />This is there best album and if noone agrees with me, then i'll have to expect the fact that I am the only one right, my fellow poeple who have given this 5 stars, we need to bring this average score up. <br />Peace out.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The characters, humor, drama, action, mixed together and insert Joss Whedon's lovable style--makes this a must-see. Watch Firefly series first and enjoy it further.
B000GRQ9UW|5.0|The 8th book in the Stephanie Plum series is another gem from writer, Janet Evanovich. Fans of the series could not wait to get their hands on this release, and new readers will be delighted at the antics of the characters in these books. In this installment, Stephanie's mother asks her to find a neighbor's missing relative, and family loyalty (and boredom) spurs Stephanie to take on the case. However, when she gets involved, a shady landlord starts warning her off the scent, and suddenly Stephanie finds out his henchman are following her. When various bad things start to happen, (i.e. her car gets blown up again, she is followed by someone in a bunny suit, snakes wind up in her apartment, and a dead body appears on her couch) Stephanie knows she is in way too deep. She enlists the help of the sexy Ranger to help her out of this jam, and also finds herself with help from both Grandma Mazur and Lula. All of the favorite characters from previous installments return, and their antics will have you laughing aloud.<br /><br />I cannot believe that there are people who actually have not read this series! Stephanie Plum is a hilarious character, and her slapstick comedy has made me laugh aloud at some strange times. If I read these books in front of other people, they invariably ask me what is so funny, and I can never quite relate the story as well as Ms. Evanovich can! There are few mystery books that can make me laugh as much as this series and yet keep me interested in the mystery, but this series does it all. Who else but Stephanie Plum can have every car she has ever owned wrecked in some way (they usually blow up), and be chased by a person in a bunny suit? If you have never read any of the books in the series, join the millions of others that have and get reading today!<br /><br />The first book in the series is \\"One for the Money\\". Enjoy!
B000GUJHD0|4.0|(Read the book and you'll get my double entendre, or read some of the reviewers below.)  Anyone who attempts to define a new age is undertaking a daunting task, and will undoubtedly be off the mark in some areas.  Pink's book is like that.  I think he presents a very good and strong argument that the world is moving into the Conceptual Age, where anything that can be done cheaper overseas will, and where the soft skills of creativity, high touch, design and others will be where the action is.  In a land of abundance like the USA, there is plenty of evidence for this: similar choices abound for various products and services and we are now more than ever more likely to make a decision based on design or other experiential factors.  The good news is that we can all cultivate the skills neccessary to participate, contribute and thrive in this new conceptual age.  On an individual basis, however, it comes down to what real choices a person has who may be mired in a non-Conceptual age job.  People like that may be left out.    Pink provides practical advice on how to develop Conceptual Age skills and I am looking forward to trying some ideas out.  My one surprise was that no where does he refer to Edward De Bono, a creativity thinker and author who posited many of the same notions in prior writings (See New Thinking for the New Millenium, for example).  There are many parallels between De Bono's notions of moving beyond judgemental, anaylitical thinking toward lateral thinking and design.    That being said, I highly recommend this book as a kind of guide to observing the many changes that are occuring in the world, as detailed in an entertaining and persuasive fashion by Pink.
B0002O06N0|2.0|As long as people don't associate the term blues with The Black Keys, I'm okay with people hyping up their album even though it's really just commercial fodder and easy brainless listening. The songs are a lot more canned and formulated this time around giving less of a groove through out the album and I can't shake the feeling that I've heard all these melodies and riffs before. Originality is severely lacking. Eric Clapton caught a ton of flak for heavily borrowing from other guitarists but redeemed himself, much thanks to Duane Allman, with the Layla album. Not even in Dan Auerbach's dreams could he steal as well as Clapton did but yet he still blatantly tries. Junior Kimbrough and RL Burnside are rolling in their graves right about now. You don't cover these blues legends and treat their life's work, soul and pain like an ATM machine.    There's one thing you can't fake as a bluesman and that's the singing voice. Dan Auerbach's voice has none of the transparent, straight from the heart, spill your guts pain that true musicians have. Dan trys his best to internalize the blues but falls embarrassingly short. They aren't something you can internalize. You either feel them or you don't. One needs to look no further than their pseudo raw-lo-fi-fuzzed-out sound in how they treat the blues. Lo-fi and rawness comes from recording on inferior equipment because you can't afford to get into a good recording studio, not by feeding your vocals and guitar into a sound processor. The sound, the voice, it's all too artificial.     The Black Keys seem to be focused on making the blues palatable with today's generation and get away with it. You can't fight popularity, but you can still try and educate. This album gets worse the more I listen to it. It's not good blues, it's not good rock, it's just mediocre music. It's sad, because Patrick Carney's a pretty damn good drummer and is the real force driving the duo.     If you want to listen to something that's truly raw, lo-fi andcontemporary bypass The Black Keys and get acquainted with Scott H. Biram. Although a little hillbilly-ish, he's a straight bluesman without the Beverly Hills trashcan sound the Black Keys offer.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A much anticipated film for thousands of Firefly, the tv series,  <br />fans and sci-fi/western buffs. Amazing special effects add impact to an already great story. This is a story of real human feelings and morality in an vastly cold and controlled universe. Odds against this small crew of a cargo ship, on the run from the universal authority because of a young girl that Captain Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) has taken under his protection, throws this crew into one mess after another, while only trying to survive and keep this old, piecemeal cargo ship called Serenity flying. All kinds of twists and cultisac's in this action/western/sci-fi/romantic/heart-warming movie, it's wild! We need more of this crew of the cargo ship Serenity, the more times you see it, the more things you didn't see before, that make it a keeper! <br />Great movie for the family, only mild cussing, no nudity, a great lesson in ethics and the value of human freedom!
B000F5GNX8|5.0|A semi-ridiculous plot born out of the old pulp detective stories. Semi-ridiculous but wildly entertaining. The cast, the writing, and the direction were more than enough to turn unrealistic into fun on screen.<br /><br />Robert Downey, Jr. impresses me time after time. Any chemical dependencies in his past aside, I think he has a lot of talent. He turns in a very enjoyable performance as Harry Lockhart. I would be hard pressed to decide if I like his work here better than in Wonder Boys, which, partially due to his influence, is a movie I love.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan is a relatively unknown name, though she makes heads turn. She was certainly a knockout in this movie, but she may be a bit too much like Liv Tyler for me, in looks, innocence, and mannerisms.<br /><br />The show was absolutely stolen by Val Kilmer. When you watch the movie you wonder if he can sustain the exalted level of sarcastic wit and incredible timing. Some credit is due to Robert Downey, Jr. for his part in how well they worked together, but Val was great. This just might be his best performance, if I may be so bold.<br /><br />There will be a time or two where you wonder if the suspense is overdone, but by the end of the movie you will probably be too entertained to remember. The writing was probably the best part; from Robert Downey, Jr.'s monologues as narrator to his constant banter with Val Kilmer, I was impressed. It was a unique film and I appreciate seeing something that is a break from the norm, especially when it is as funny and fun to watch as Kiss Kiss Bang Bang.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|The trailer for KissKissBangBang did not prepare me for the movie I saw. I had to go and see it because Shane Black's previous screenplays (Lethal Weapon, the Last Boyscout, The Long kiss Goodnight) were hardboiled action flicks with a great feel of cool attitude, but they all featured characters that were really touching for the genre. (Remember Bruce Willis saying \\"f*ck you\\" to his cheating wife to show her he cares about her at the end of Boyscout? Isn't that a great scene?) <br />Warner advertised the movie as a kind of comedy. The trailer focused a quidproquo scene that does not exceed 2 minutes of screentime. <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE HAS SPIRIT <br />Anyway, Black has written his best screenplay ever, with highly colorful characters, offering Downey and Kilmer, 2 beautiful has-been in Hollywood terms, their best roles in 10 years. <br />Black likes film noir and he knows how the genre works. In the great tradition of The Big Sleep, the plot, though very simple in the end, is narrated in such a way that it looks very complicated. The characters follow wrong trails, and Downey's voiceover is a hilarious hommage to the cynical tough guy attitude that Bogart might have been.  <br />There are different layers in the screenplay and Black seems to be playing with the mechanic of writing. He even reveals some of his trick-of-the-trades through some dialogues, not only about KKBB but he also makes connection to his previous scripts (L.A., buddy movies, Xmas time, scenes of torture followed by a big gunfight,...) <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE HAS HEART <br />One could compare KKBB to Tarantino's work. You take a genre film, quote the rules, wink at the audience, then break the rules. But there is one thing I did not find in PulpFiction or Reservoir Dogs, it's heart and sympathy for the characters. <br />KKBB cares about the characters. They're all losers in a way or another, just trying to survive in the city. There are beautiful moments between Downey and Michelle Monaghan, and especially one piece of dialogue you would not expect after the spider-scene (you'll have to see this movie).  <br />Look also for a short but terribly gripping flashback about the childhood of Monaghan's character. <br />I am thinking also about the killing of an anonymous \\"pink haired girl\\": her death is presented in a disturbing manner, compared to the usual action/thriller style. <br /> <br />THIS MOVIE HAS GUTS <br />It really does! The dialogues are sharp and straight to the stomach style.  <br />Expect a few loud laughs as well. Some scenes got me laughing very lound in the theater whereas I first saw it by myself. And I usually am a vey quiet person when watching a movie. <br /> <br />I showed the movie to 5 persons who virtually had no will to see it based on the trailer and they all loved it. I suspect a huge fan-base will build around this unsung masterpiece. <br /> <br />This came as the greatest surprise of last year and I just could watch it over and over again.
B00005JOQS|4.0|Adrenaline. If I had to pick a one-word theme for the movie, that would be it. Edge or your seat, heart-pounding adrenaline. If you have watched the preview for the movie, you may be familiar with a scene involving Superman and an airplane. It is maybe 30 minutes into the movie and I kid you not, they could have ended it right there and I would have paid to see it a second time. That is not to say the movie was downhill from that point on, but it was worth the price of admission, even in the days of increased movie ticket prices.  <br /> <br />I had heard reports that Superman Returns was too much of a love story and not enough of what we should expect from a Superman movie: Superman fighting crime and saving the day. The (awkward) love story rekindled between our caped hero and Lois Lane was obvious, but not overbearing. There were scenes devoted to it entirely, but this was not the first Superman movie to do it. Let's not forget the rest of the movie, however. Bryan Singer did a great job of incorporating all of Superman's powers over the course of the film. We see plenty of flying, impenetrable skin, super-human strength, heat vision and super breath. But don't leave out the tights and the cape; Superman was well represented throughout the film.  <br /> <br />I liked how well Brandon Routh maintained the dichotomy of the character he played, selling the Clark Kent secret identity. He stayed clumsy as Clark and was, for the most part, strong and confident as Superman. I was among those in the camp who thought Tom Welling probably should have gotten the part when \\"Mr. Unknown\\" Brandon Routh was announced. Sorry Tom, but Brandon ended up being a good casting choice. Tom Welling may have been a little too \\"teen drama\\" and not enough \\"comic-book superhero\\" for the part.  <br /> <br />Kevin Spacey is no Gene Hackman, but he did well as Lex Luthor. Watching Lex in action I did have the realization that though I typically prefer Marvel books, I like DC villains much better. My favorites are The Joker (big surprise), The Riddler and Lex Luthor. DC villains, to me, seem much more... complex. Lex Luthor is a bit over the top and he does require some over-acting and forced lines as well as some just-right facial expressions to fully portray his quirks. Spacey kept his composure and I really think he nailed the part.  <br /> <br />So I really did like the movie, but I did have a few small gripes. You probably would not believe I wrote this if there wasn't a flaw or two pointed out... <br /> <br />_ <br /> <br />Did they make Kate Bosworth look like Natalie Portman on purpose? Or did it just happen naturally? Don't get me wrong, she looked better as Lois Lane than she has in any other role I have seen her in. All I am saying is that after Natalie does a movie or two with a shaved head, maybe Hollywood is trying to snatch her look back from her before she has a chance to make another movie with hair.  <br /> <br />I love that James Marsden continues to get roles in comic book films as the guy who has the girl who is at least arguably in love with someone else (think Cyclops). I understand he followed Writer/Producer/Director Bryan Singer from the X-Men series to Superman, but he is now sufficiently typecast.  <br /> <br />Was Brandon Routh's \\"Clark Kent\\" hair a tribute to Jason Schwartzman?  <br /> <br />Kal Penn goes from a late night craving for White Castle burgers to playing Lex Luthor's goon? Really? It does not seem like the most natural transition to me. At least I am pretty sure he did not have a single speaking part.  <br /> <br />_ <br /> <br />Petty criticisms aside, I really liked Superman Returns. The movie had a few slow scenes, primarily right at the beginning, but they served well enough to build up to the climax. The casting was great, even down to Sam Huntington as Jimmy Olsen. I hope I can find time to see it again...in IMAX this time.
B000FGGE68|1.0|I couldn't wait for this movie to end.  The premise to the movie is good, but the special effects were awful!  I've seen video games on my old nintendo that were this bad (really, some of it could have been rendered on your xbox or ps/2).<br /><br />The plot and acting was bad, the gunfights, well you might have just put in some clips from any other action movie and you'd never have noticed the difference.<br /><br />I'm a big scifi fan so I'm pretty open minded for bad plots/acting etc, but this was just plain BAD.  I'm going to sell my copy on Amazon Marketplace just to make more space on my shelf for some more deserving drizzle.
B00005JOVH|3.0|The FDA has found a \\"cure\\" to the common \\"disease\\" shared by mutants. It is up to Magneto's Brotherhood to stop the drug from being used to eradicate the population of mutants. The drug will allegedly be used on a voluntary basis only so the X-Men would like to help keep the peace. The Brotherhood is more skeptical and anticipates it being used with malicious intent. It is war the ensues. <br /> <br />Well at least war was what the trailer and previews lead you to believe. My thoughts on the movie ahead of time were simple: the plot will be severely lacking, but with a mutant war I will be able to sit there in my geeky glory and try to pick out which mutants I recognize from the TV series and the old comic books. That which was delivered fell well short of that which was promised/expected.  <br /> <br />The actual \\"war\\" scene was only cool because Wolverine and Beast went crazy. Their choreographed fight scenes were fun to watch. Beyond that, there was nothing. The \\"war\\" scene lasted only a few minutes and it consisted of Magneto and Pyro sending Juggernaut into the building and unleashing an infantry of lesser mutants against the opposition while they stood back lobbed exploding cars.  <br /> <br />Before I go on with my analysis, I really need the answer to a question. Are they making another X-Men movie? There has been speculation in both directions. Yes, there will be a fourth installment; we're not done yet. No, the X-Men group movies are over, make way for solo stories (it was called The LAST Stand for a reason...).  <br /> <br />If there will be no fourth movie, then I think the ending and much of the story throughout X-Men 3 was incredibly pointless. You will have to ask me separately for my more pointed spoiler complaints.  <br /> <br />They took such care in introducing Warren Worthington A/K/A Archangel, yet he was very under-used and remained entirely excluded from the action.  <br /> <br />There was talk about a reduced budget for X-Men 3, and yet we see so much time and money wasted on a prolonged scene where Magneto uproots half of the Golden Gate Bridge and flies it across the water... Just take a boat. Or rewrite the script to Worthington labs is on the mainland so they can walk. <br /> <br />Why did they get our geek hopes up with a teaser fight scene with a Sentinal...only to dash said hopes because it was just a fight simulation in the Danger Room?  <br /> <br />The fun of the books and TV show for me is that they were basically like a Street Fighter video game where each cut scene would pit two mutants with comparable powers against each other and they would fight. The movies really try to add a real world element that takes the fun away. The creators have hundreds of mutants at their disposal and they opt against introducing so many of them. The story could write itself if someone would just do a little research into characters. <br /> <br />The movie was decent enough. I can say that I have seen it and participate in the angst-filled discussions going forward. That is about all I took away from X-Men 3: The Last Stand.
B0000033IS|5.0|In The R&B World, I don't think any woman (or anybody period) has had the influence that Aretha Franklin has had.  From, \\"Respect\\", to, \\"Chain Of Fools\\", to, \\"Freeway Of Love\\", Franklin has recorded songs that have become some of the most recognizable in the history of soul.  Soul got its start as an outgrowth of R&B that incorporated elements of gospel with powerful vocals and harmonies.  Atlantic records was a huge producer of this kind of music and many of the really famous soul singers got their start there.  Franklin is no exception and with masterpieces like, \\"I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You\\", and, \\"Lady Soul\\", Atlantic records was on the music map big time.   <br /> <br />Aretha Franklin's soul music combines elements of bitter romance with a sense of humor and irony (excepts on the ballads which were usually dead serious) to create a good time sound that everybody could enjoy.  The record, \\"I Never Loved A Man The Way I Love You\\", was Aretha Franklin's first big hit.  And with songs like the woman's anthem, \\"Respect\\", the sad blues number, \\"I Drown In My Own Tears\\", and the romantic ballad, \\"Do Right Woman--Do Right Man\\", its not hard to see why.  Franklin plays the piano in many of the songs which was extremely unusual back in those days.  Through out rock history there simply have not been nearly as many women playing instruments as there has been men.  Franklin along with others such as the Heart sisters and Maureen Tucker of the Velvet Underground have changed that sterotype and today you see far more girls picking up instruments and playing them. <br /> <br />Though this is not the birth of soul (Ray Charles has been credited with his Atlantic recordings) this is defintely a landmark soul and R&B album.  Many present day R&B women (and many of the men I must add) would not have had careers had Aretha Franklin not set the standard with this album.  A essential recording for any serious fan of soul music.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|With a CD player in my car, the death of WCBS-FM as the home of golden oldies, I find myself playing my CDs in the car more than I used to.  Yes, I already own most of the tracks, but it doesn't matter.  The remastering make alone is worth the price of album, along with the booklet inside the jewel box showing the artwork on the 45s' sleeves.  Then add to it having all of these on one disc. <br /> <br />My son had heard the Beatles once or twice before I bought this disc, but now he's a full-fledged Beatles fan (except he hates \\"Hey, Jude\\" and \\"Yesterday\\" for reasons of which I am not sure).   <br /> <br />On one disk, you now have all of their greatest hits together with a quality that their music enjoys.  If you only buy one CD this year, this should be the \\"1.\\"
0679735909|5.0|Before there was the DaVinci Code, there was a story of two intrepid researchers fighting against time and exposure to find the truth.  That comparision out of the way, Possession is a highly literary novel that deals with the reality of the \\"cults\\" surrounding famous literary figures and the idea of what would happen if one day some researcher stumbled on a scandalous past that was not in all of the major studies of their \\"patron\\" author. <br /> <br />I loved this book.  I agree with the other reviewers in that this book is hard to get into, at first.  After putting it down several years ago, I came back to it, read the first 150 pages, and then promptly took a two-week vacation from it, and then finished it in several consecutive sittings.  I say hard to get into with all seriousness, but it is the hard to get into that one finds when reading classic literature, like Jane Eyre, or Daisy Miller.  Believe me, I have advanced degrees in English and English studies, but even for me, it was hard to get used to the book.  However, the payoff is very high and the characters are very engaging.   <br /> <br />This is a work that one can easily write many papers and do much analysis with - it is multi-faceted and involves many levels.  But, is this not what literature asks us to do anyway?
0689865384|4.0|Wow! What a surprise!  I had an inkling that this book would be engaging like Westerfelds' other books, but I had no clue it would grab hold of me as hard as it did.<br /><br />The Story: Uglies is set in a highly technological world where at the age of 16, citizens go through an operation to make them `Pretty'.  The narrator, Tally, is just about to be 16 and can hardly wait for her operation, but her plans change when her rebel friend Shay runs away the night of their operation to a place where supposedly no one is Pretty.  From there, Tally has to decide how much being Pretty really matters to her.<br /><br />My Thoughts:  Westerfeld has done it again.  Although, I found some of the story elements predictable, Uglies is a great read.  Tally is annoying in the first half of the book, but I found myself warming up to her in the middle, and totally standing by her in the last few pages.<br /><br />Which reminds me...  As of this writing, I am waiting for my hold on the Pretties to come through.  Uglies ends in such a way that if you liked it, you'll want to read the sequel, Pretties, as soon as possible.  You've been warned!!!
0345475674|3.0|His other books are somewhat wooden, and by demanding of themselves circuitous plots, work themselves into a uniform level of intensity. This book is a simpler story, with fewer twists and subterfuges, and as a result, it breathes reality and human energies where Harris' other books seem almost computer-generated in contrast. Yes, all familiar themes are rehashed here; it is done well. The author's insights onto history are both hackneyed and refreshing. It's not Hemingway but it's a good read.

6305364613|4.0|As my bio states, I'm a former English teacher.  For 9th grade students, Romeo & Juliet was the most anticipated/dreaded time of the year - with the girls anticipating and the guys dreading.  In teaching the play, I used both this movie version and the 1966 Zefferelli version.  As a former teacher, allow me to share some tips.<br /><br />There are lots of good things about this movie.  While the two title roles are only good in execution, some roles are truly great, Tybalt and Harold Perrineau's Mercutio among them.  It is a worthy film in its own right, but it is also an EXCELLENT teaching tool.<br /><br />Now to the teaching tips:<br /><br />(1) Don't show this movie all at one time.  Students will miss 90% of what they need to see.<br /><br />(2) Show the movie simultaneously with Zefferelli's film.  Both movies have much to offer and some weaknesses.  Invite students to compare and contrast the two, acting as experts.<br /><br />(3) Show both movies a few scenes at a time, as you read the play.  Invite them to analyze what each director/screenwriter included/left out.  As them why the director/screenwriter made those choices.<br /><br />(4)  Remember at all times that Shakespeare was not writing a \\"work of literature\\"; he was writing a play, intended for performance.  No student will fully understand any of Shakespeare's plays unless they SEE them, preferably in as many forms as possible.<br /><br />Practical Example:  Read the prologue and explain the function of the \\"chorus\\".  Have students translate the lines and explain what they mean.  View Zeferelli's prologue (under a minute)and discuss.  Then view Luhrmann' version (about 1.5 minutes).  Ask them what might have inspired him to do a prologue with a newsreporter as the chorus.  Have them pick out the symbols, foreshadowing, etc.  And finally let them vote about which one they like best and why.<br /><br />Repeat the process with each section of the play.  It will take a little longer than showing the film at once, but you will be surprised how much 9th grade students will be able to understand (on their own) by the end of the play.showing the film at once, but you will be surprised how much 9th grade students will be able to understand (on their own) by the end of the play.
0790729350|3.0|Don't get me wrong,I watched listened to and read everything I could find on Woodstock and always will.I've seen this movie maybe 25 times and love it.I bought the 25th CD collection and this directors cut back when it came out.I had not watch the DVD in a year or so because the sound just didn't cut it like I remembered.A month ago I bought an LCD TV and a nice surround sound system and everything has sounded wonderful until I put this on.The surround system has 8-10 different audio settings and they all sound pretty bad with THIS DVD especially many of the performances.I waited to review this DVD until I read others to make sure it wasn't just my ears and I find it's better to watch and listen to the older VHS version when I want to watch this.Great movie,concert performances and people watching BUT really disappointing audio soundtrack.I hope it can someday be improved,look what they did to Monterey Pop & Gimme Shelter,now that's a couple of directors cuts.
0393317552|5.0|Anyone who has ever wondered how human civilization has evolved into its present state should read this book.  Although Diamond's book has flaws that other reviewers have mentioned, I think the author does an excellent job of supporting his theory with enough background information and facts to allow readers to easily understand his argument.  I doubt anyone could read this book and not be changed or swayed by it, even if only slightly.  This is a compelling, insightful, and educational book - one that you are unlikely to forget.
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Finally John Ottman has written a score worthy of much praise and adulation, and not just because He used some of William's themes either!<br /><br />After the good but forgettable X2 and the rather weak Fantastic Four, I was worried about how his take on Superman would be. There was no need to worry. I actually think this CD improves on what John Williams did in the original soundtrack!<br /><br />Blasphemy? Maybe.<br /><br />Right off, Ottman gives us a slightly more intense rendition of the classic Superman Theme. I have felt lately that the Superman theme hasn't aged particularly well, but Ottman was able to modernize it without changing a note. Bravo! Then he pulls out a surprising and attention-grabbing rendition of the Kent family theme that is also top-notch. The way he inserts the love theme into his new Lois theme is also very impressive.<br /><br />His new material, like the Lois Theme, is very memorable. I liked the fact that Lex Luthor finally got a nice and nasty motif, even though I have a soft spot for \\"March of the Villains\\" from the original.<br /><br />I don't know if this was on purpose or not, but I enjoyed the Goldsmithian rhythms in track 5, \\"the Bank Job\\", which my Dad pointed out as sounding similar to Capricorn One, and I also really like track 9, \\"Not like the Train Set\\", which seems to borrow from Danny Elfman's \\"Hulk\\" Theme.<br /><br />With this CD, Ottman has finally been able to add a worthwhile addition to all the great Comic Book Soundtracks. Again, BRAVO!
B0002XMF5I|2.0|Maybe it is the import release I received, but the mix on this album is horrible. The bass is way too prominent and the vocals sound like they are recorded in a can somewhere far far away.<br /><br />The mix does seem to get better on Zero the Hero and the songs after it, but the first 1/2 of the album is a muddy mess.<br /><br />As for the music itself. It doesn't really sound like Sabbath. It sounds more like someone trying to sound like Sabbath.  Gillan's  voice just doesn't go well with the Sabbath sound. The guitar work is good, the bass and drums are somewhat pedestrian. Just missing something.<br /><br />If you are a Sabbath fan and need to complete your collection by purchasing this album then I suppose it is worth it. However if you are looking for a good Sabbath album look elsewhere.

B00009TB5G|5.0|How could this be any better?  It seamlessly integrates extra footage and the story itself is told in a way that flows, makes sense to you if you have not read the books (quite unlike Harry Potter, I might add) and the music punctuates at the perfect times.  This entire trilogy is masterfully created, the actors are all amazing in their own right. It's rare not to be disappointed with a fantasy genre movie, and LOTR is that rarity.
0446672653|5.0|This is a fascinating story about two people who went to Dr. Weiss for past-life regression therapy. There are many levels of soulmates, and Elizabeth and Pedro were of the deeper kind. They had spent many lifetimes together, sharing a great love, but in this lifetime they were strangers. Chapter by chapter we see the story of these two souls, aching to find each other, coming closer and closer, like two streams converging into a mighty river. Finally, Dr. Weiss sees the connection between them, but what is his duty as their therapist? Is it his place to play matchmaker, or should he leave it up to the fates to decide?<br /><br />For anyone who fears to never find love in a barren world, or who has lost someone very dear to them, Dr. Weiss's book on the persistence of love and relationship beyond the threshold of death will be of great comfort.<br /><br />Richard Salva--author of [[ASIN:0977238105 Soul Journey from Lincoln to Lindbergh [UNABRIDGED]]]

B00006CXSS|5.0|By now, most people have heard of the mini-series Band Of Brothers. Unfortunally I neglected this show when it was originally aired in 2001 because of 9/11 and its aftermath. When I received this order from Amazon, I honestly did not know what to expect. After watching all 10 episodes, the praise this show received was well deserved. After watching the mini-series, I began to think, \\"can the same type of comraderie survive in this age?\\" I would like to hope so. On a related note, in 2004, when I was a junior in high school, I attended Boy's State which is a subordinate org. of the American Legion, a veteran's organization. There, WWII vets told me stories about best friends from childhood dying in front of them, and of acts of heroism that could not be made up by even the best hollywood screenwriter. But they put up with it for the man next to him, and in the belief that what they were doing was just. After taking into consideration of veterans as well as the portrayal of soldiers in WWII, this review can best be summed up by the words than are on the tin box: They Depended On Each Other And The World Depended On Them.

B00004ZAV3|5.0|After buying and then listening to the Beatles' \\"1\\" CD five years ago, I began to purchase Beatles DVDs, CDs, books, etc. I now own all of the 13 UK releases+all the official movies+several Beatles box sets. \\"1\\" showcases the Beatles' awesome musicianship in a nutshell. But it only serves as an introduction to their incredible story. This CD is highly recommendable for any music fan. It might be the best release I've ever heard. But all 13 of their releases (take away the original Yellow Submarine soundtrack) are pure magic. This CD turned me into a Beatlemaniac, even though I wasn't even born when they broke up. I would recommend all their work, but \\"1\\" is the perfect album. It's amazing that it's 40+ years later, and they still had a #1 album called \\"1\\" that sold over 10 million albums.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|If you own the original \\"Wall\\" DVD, or even VHS, throw it away and get this. The picture quality is pristine and the sound unbelievable. And while someone who's not a fan of Pink Floyd would find the storyline eratic and confusing, it's still an interesting piece of art thanks to brilliant animation and wild photography.
0060005424|5.0|In \\"Sabriel\\" Garth Nix told us of the Abhorsen who deal in death, and now he enlightens us about the Clayr, the women who are gifted with the power to see into the future (albeit not always clearly) and then there are those awkward times when things get confused by alternate futures and such complications.<br /><br />Lirael is the daughter of a Clayr, but is a very late bloomer, having not inherited the gift of the Sight like all other Clayr teenagers.  This means that birthday after birthday she gets stuck at the kiddie table, wearing the equivalent of Dora the Explorer play clothes while her younger associates (she's rather lacking in the friends category) go off to their debutante duties.<br /><br />As is often done with teens that are slow to develop, she gets to choose a trade, and she picks library duties, a very dangerous occupation in a place where reading can sometimes be hazardous to your health.  Having a special aptitude for charter magic, Lirael quickly moves herself up the ladder, unbeknownst (I always liked that word) to her senior librarians, and begins exploring the forbidden parts of the library on her own.  Of course she gets into all sorts of trouble, releasing a creature known as a Stilken, and having to use all her power to fight it.  Some people make up imaginary friends to talk to, but not Lirael - after meeting with an ancient healer, she conjures herself a companion named The Disreputable Dog (of unknown magical origin) that is much more than a best friend and who aids and abets her in her voyage of discovery.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in the other sub-plot in this book, Touchstone and Sabriel from book one have two children, a girl who will be queen, and a boy who isn't too sure he wants to be Abhorsen, as he doesn't like seeing dead people.  After a rather unfortunate experience on the other side, he is ready to hang up his book and bells for good, but he doesn't want to disappoint his parents.<br /><br />All is not well in the Old Kingdom, and his mother is hardly ever at home because of the demands of her job, and his father is finding that it's not always great to be the King.  When Sameth (for that is the boy's name) learns that his school pal Nicholas has managed to land himself in grave danger (literally), he runs away from under his sister's thumb and charges off half-cocked to the rescue.  Fortunately for him, Mogget the mysterious cat awakens in time to accompany him and save him from himself.<br /><br />Just in the nick of time the paths of Lirael and Sameth collide in mid stream (again literally) and together they join against Hedge the evil necromancer and his cronies, including the unwitting Nicholas, who are trying to release something very nasty from the bottom of a pit.  At the house of Abhorsen they discover a link in the family tree that affects them both.<br /><br />Like all middle parts of a trilogy, this one leaves a lot of unanswered questions at the end, and should not be read without first reading book one, but is so well written that it will have you turning the pages as quickly as you can.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, July 25, 2006Kingdom, and his mother is hardly ever at home because of the demands of her job, and his father is finding that it's not always great to be the King.

B0000AOV85|5.0|This is truly a must have for any Pink Floyd fan. While there is no contact between members, there is no talk of prior group problems, each member soley talking about the great music. DVD includes new footage of Gilmour, Mason, and Waters all playing and singing in their homes, interveiws with all members, and my personal favorite, a sound tour with the sound editor who shows the mixing of the album right in front of you. A great DVD
B000BTC5LW|4.0|I was at both concerts they did at RFK, I suspect it was '94.  I was in awe, the stage center piece had an HDef circle adding characters to the story that unfolded before you through sight and sound.  I couldn't believe it then...and I reflect on this recent release and can't believe it now...those old boys can rock!<br /><br />Now, why not 5 stars?  Easy to answer, my 42 inch LCD wall mounted monitor, Bose speaker system, Digital Audio Video switcher...were pretty much useless...it's not in HDef. Okay...that's the only poo-poo I give it.  Master piece of rock history.
B0007PALRU|5.0|I was amazed when I first saw this movie in the theatre. I was taken aback but not shocked. Not stunned but very, very afraid. This movie continually reminds me of the four+ days of almost non-stop rain that we had recently in New York City. And I thought, is what the movie saying coming to pass? This movie has heightened my awareness, and articles such as the one recently printed by the New York Times on Global Warming AND the shift in global climate, have hopefully caused others to become more aware as well. The planet is experiencing desertification and drought in more places, continuous and spreading. Hurricanes in Boston and tornadoes in upstate New York are signs that what we are experiencing and what the Earth and its keeper are trying to tell us is...STOP!!!  <br /> <br />Please buy this movie and then do your part. We cannot prevent or stop this possible scenerio from occurring, but we can slow down the process. <br /> <br />The movie is not about special effects, but about our relationships with the Earth and with one another. It is a love story with, a quasi-happy ending.  <br /> <br />The DVD is of high-quality, and the extra features are very important for the person concerned to review and ponder.
B000ENV2P0|3.0|I'm not going to write about the music, cause you can read about that in one of the other reviews, so I'll instead talk about the boxed set.   <br /> <br />If this boxed set was $29.99 it would be worth every penny, but for $49.99, the contents aren't worth it.  Included with the set, you get: <br /> <br />2-Amazingly good CDs <br />1-DVD about the making of Dani California <br />4-Marbles <br />4-Notes from the band <br />1-28 page book <br />2-Wooden things (tops?) <br />1-Killer box to store it all in <br /> <br />Cds- Personally I think it is about the best RHCP has to offer.  You be your own judge. <br />DVD- Video is about the best I've seen.  Making of the video has little-to-no John, which sucks.  Making of is bland, but it's a making of, so what do you expect? <br />Marbles- DISSAPOINTING!  I thought they were going to be in theme with Stadium Arcadium.  Instead, you get four, and they are just regular marbles you could get at Toys R' Us. <br />Notes from the band- Actually just pieces of scrap paper.  John and Chad's are cool.   <br />28 page book- Probably the best of the extra stuff.  Same as the book you get with the regular album version (lyrics and pictures), but has more pictures, and is of very high quality.   <br />Wooden things- what are these??? I guess I could use them as drink coasters... <br />Killer box- The outside of the boxed set is undoubtedly the coolest packaging I've seen in a long time. It's a 3-D version of the album cover.  Really Cool. <br /> <br />Well I hope my breakdown of what is inside the Boxed Set was helpful.  If I would have read a review like this, I wouldn't have gone out and bought another copy.   <br />
B000BVQ9JO|4.0|You know whats wrong with music today, is the people who write reviews and just critisize the music. This cd is not the best, nor will it ever be, But common you can honestly sit there and cut this music up, take a look at what much music is playing you want something to complain about, write to them. Or cut there albums up, when I hear a peace of music like this I know its no, Pink Floyd, zepplin, tool.........Primus, but compared to todays standared, this is a peace of work, wich is not saying much these days, But about half of you dont know good music when its staring you in the face, but for all others who can respect this album with out picking out every little thing they dont like about it, pat your self on the back, because there are only a few of us it seems these days, who Knows/remebers what music really is. I remeber when I was KID, I listend to albums with my dad not just individual songs, music in general is going down hill, slowly starving its self to death, But to my fellow people who share the same oppinion, hold in there. Something Big is Bound To Happen. SOON.

B0000669JL|5.0|Greatest Hit albums typically have the same problem: they never satisfy die-hard fans, always leaving out the anthem some of them felt that must have made it to the compilation of their idol's best works. So, how can this Bob Marley greatest hits album have everyone so happy. The answer is simple: in spite of Bob's vast discography and overabundance of great material to choose from, the curators of this selection seem to not have been cheap about it and actually threw in here the absolute best material Bob Marley ever recorded, including the best takes (some of them live) of some of his hits available in multiple versions.<br /><br />So, whether you are new to Marley's discography and want a broad exposure to it or you want to have a handy album to throw into your player for the trip to the beach or your favorite chillout spot, follow Bob's advice and don't wait in vain. Go get your copy of \\"Legend\\" so that your reggae needs may be well served.

B00009W0U4|1.0|why won't anyone tell the truth about this movie?  probably because if they did, no one would watch it.  this movie starts off with the worst camera work i've ever seen in a movie... it's bad.  and i mean bad.  and i mean REALLY BAD.   for example, it will show a light overhead or something scrolling past about 5,000 times.  seriously, that's what passes for \\"art.\\"  that's supposed to have \\"meaning.\\"  you've gotta be kidding me.  i can't believe anyone can watch this garbage for more than 5 minutes.  i made it about 15 or so waiting for something to happen.  a total waste of time.  i'm sure the story is good, but this director is a pretentious moron.  oh yeah, it's a french movie... i think i'll skip french movies from now on.  no wonder everyone hates the french, making pretentious \\"art\\" like this and thinking they're superior to americans!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This album is excellent. Ms. Rae really did a great job with her debut...making herself one of my Favorite artist ever.!!!!And I have great taste.
B000EULJLU|4.0|On their new album, Tool have lost any form og aggression, their lyrics lean toward more trippy or prog-ish.  That doesn't mean they have become pretentious as some of the songs, such as 'the pot' are still very much down to earth.  The album at times is so other-worldly that it can escape your comprehension at times, which is the downside, you have to be in the right mood for this album.  It's a good album to do art work to, or relax to, but I'd find these songs difficult to apreciate live, simply because the songs are often slow and at times uneventful.  However when the songs do bite, they bite hard.  Maynard's voice is even more ethereal and powerful on this album than on any of his other work.  One of my favourite things about this album, is that it is more like a work of modern art, you have to listen to it deeply to understand it and get the meanings (like you have to look deeper into modern art to understand it.)  Don't understand me? Listen to 'Lost Keys.'  They have become like the modern arisits of rock, they work with mood and atmosphere in a way they never have before.  Sadly, they have not made any videos yet to accompany these amazing soundscapes.  The only other sad thing about this album, is the fact that the last song is simply a filler and very pointless.
B000FGGE68|2.0|This movie uses every cliched idea ever about a female action hero who is out for justice.  Why is she so pissed off? She got a disease that turned her into a hemophage (aka not human) and the government killed her baby. What's she going to do about it? Kill all humans.  How? By strutting around in midriff-baring spandex and wielding guns and knives while never breaking a sweat or messing up her hair.<br /><br />It's almost ridiculous how bad this movie is, to the point where it was almost good because I wouldn't have thought you could shove so much garbage into an hour and a half.  Boy was I wrong! Catwoman, Queen of the Damned... not even close. This movie looks like a video game half the time and has so many pauses for effect, I think there's more silence than sound (music not included). And then there's the snappy dialogue.  I mean, with lines like \\"Killing is what I do. It's what I'm good at,\\" and \\"You got hemo blood on me. It is on,\\" how could this not be the gem of contemporary vampire cinema.  If you're in the mood for a laugh, you should rent this movie. But if you're in the mood for a decent action movie, look elsewhere.

I have been challenged by this book as it has taken alot of practices that I currently do and it has streched me to take those practices further. <br /> <br />I could tell of a ton new practices that the book walks a person through but I will limit it to only one, and will then encourage you to make sure you buy the book yourself. Here is briefly the one new practice that I am now making sure I follow: Being more strategic before, during and after every conference I attend. I loved what he shared that he does before conferences and I am definately making sure I do the same now. <br /> <br />The book provided challenges but it never was a challenge to read. Is what I mean is it read well and kept me involved the whole time.
B00003CXTG|3.0|I think other reviewers really do miss the point--especially the Europeans. Hey, guys, this is an event that happened to America! Isn't it only natural that it be shown from an American point of view? Polish or Russian movies (and English ones!) would show their respective viewpoints, too.  <br /> <br />That being said, the romance really is a little trite. What's worse, there's little chemistry between the principals and the girl. Because of too little character development, you really don't care much \\"who gets the girl.\\" I found it more interesting to ponder the male-male bonding, however; are we viewers supposed to detect some homoeroticism? <br /> <br /> <br />But the real strengths of this movie are 1) the battle scenes and 2) the three-strip Technicolor. This was the last movie ever made  in Technicolor; one must see the colors to believe them. Brilliant blues and greens (and yellows and oranges!) jump startingly off the screen at the viewer. The battle scenes and the exterior shots in Hawaii promenade this Technicolor most prominently; has a beach shot ever been photographed more beautifully, or a battle shot so realistically? <br /> <br />This movie is worth seeing for the cinematography alone. Forget the silly romance.
1582403589|5.0|First, don't let this book make you decide on the rest of the series.  It's supposed to be a long version of Romero's Dawn of the Dead.  The zombies and the rules are the same, but the story takes its own twists and turns.  This story takes a look at the human aspect of a zombie outbreak and how the people deal with the situations that arise.  It's a great case study of human relationships under the strain of constant tragedy.  My friends that have borrowed this or gotten it themselves, have become addicted to it.  It's a great series.
1591841216|5.0|as mentioned, this book explains the benefits of making bad decisions.  It shows how risk is your security in life and why unreason is better than reason.  It's about having the confidence to roll the dice. <br /> <br />Especially, I like the sentence : It's the wrong way to think, but the right way to win.... <br /> <br />Wish you all enjoy it! <br />
0060591714|5.0|Excelente lectura. No pude guardar el libro hasta terminarlo. Aunque este orientado hacia una audiencia juvenil, su lectura amena y sencilla, mantiene al publico adulto interesado. No puedo evitar reconocer un poco el trio de Harry Potter (Harry, Hermione y Ron) en Alexander (con espejuelos y todo), Nadia y el principe Dil Bahadur , todos y cada cual con sus capacidades psiquicas (magia?).  La nota humoristica de la autora rompe con la seriedad del pensamiento budista sin faltarle el respeto. Creo que si el texto se estudiara en salon de clase formal podria ser de mucho provecho para modificar la perspectiva de la juventud occidental. Isabel Allende puede escribir lo que quiera y del tema que quiera porque ya ha adquirido la madurez (como mujer y como escritora) que se necesita para opinar sobre cualquier cosa, Bravo!
B00000099Y|4.0|If you like hard, angst ridden lyrical assaults..then AENIMA is for you. If you like well rounded masterpieces blending the best rock beats and most meaningful lyrics imaginable.. buy Lateralus and Undertow. In that order, so that Lateralus can warm you up for the harder more forceful, though less intriguing, Undertow.
B0002KQNL8|5.0|It's a Zombie movie. Like it or don't. Zombie's are the dead back alive and usually feed off the living. That happens in this movie. Go figure. I mean let's be honest... What else do you have to do this evening? Watch this movie and like it.
B000F3A7LE|5.0|That this was re-released is to me a great gift. This album changed my life, as I was following Robert Fripp and his career after King Crimson disbanded in 1974 or 1975. I was desperately trying to find out what he was up to at that time. In 1979, after reading a story in a magazine that he had been \\"digging ditches\\" somewhere in England, and studying the work of J.G. Bennett, G.I.Gurdjieff and others, I was so intrigued I checked into these authors written work. Then, during his Frippertronics tour in 1979, I was able to see him perform live in a small record store in Atlanta. Back to the \\"product\\", sorry...the album is a wonderful composite and indication of what and where Robert and some of his collegues were \\"at\\" in their music, and their inner lives, and so much more. On the albums in this limited edition of \\"Exposure\\", are the First Edition, remastered 24 bit and sounding crisper and finer than ever. We hear the likes of Robert throughout with his unique and wonderous sounds he makes with his guitars and his modified tape decks. Also appearing on the album are the exquisite talents of Brian Eno, Peter Gabriel, Daryl Hall, Peter Hamill of \\"Van der Graf Generator\\", Tony Levin, Terre Roche, and many others including excerpts of recordings of talks given by J.G. Bennett which are very instructive and compelling. The second disc is the Third Edition, with bonus tracks. Very Exciting stuff to listen to, and to \\"be\\" with. Highly recommended for Fripp fans and anyone seeking music and media that inspires the seeker of meaning in Life.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Just got the first season yesterday. I watched through a few of the first episodes, skimming through the chapters. It looks great. Why would it have been cancelled by the WB network so quickly, after just 4 seasons?
B0001L3LUE|5.0|This reveals a great deal about Vietnam and the 1960's. <br />Should be prized by students of Kennedy, Johnson, and our military history in the nuclear age.
B000003CMB|5.0|It just doesn't get much better than this for music fans, especially those of blues and rock guitar. The vocals of Greg Allman are exceptional, he sings with intense feeling and has a great \\"white blues\\" voice. The rhythm section is also tremendous. Everything is great, but the guitars take one's breath away. Dickey Betts is a great sidekick to Duane Allman and is a major factor in the greatness of the recording, but in the end it's Duane that makes us gasp and want more. There's no other player in the world quite like Duane; he plays one heck of a mean fretted guitar, but on slide, he's from another planet, with the exception of Muddy Waters and Ry Cooder, no one belongs in the same universe as Allman on slide. He is the god of slide, the Zeus, the MAN! You must hear him to believe it, buy now!
B00005NRNB|5.0|Harrison Ford and Wendy Crewson are believable in this action/human story of what happens when the presidents plane is hijacked. The real story however is about how hard it is to hold to ones principles when doing so means the death of a loved one. It is a quality, action movie.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Killer Klowns.. This movie is so bad, it's good. Like drinking too much Nyquil. The people who think up things such as this are pure gods...  Hail to the king, baby. And don't forget the pie!!
B000AYEI5Y|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like all the songs on this CD, and after listening too it I have to say it was WELL worth the money!!!  I like the 'clean' version better as I didn't think the cursing really fit in the songs I heard with it in (and I am not the type that is against cursing).
6305897786|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS NOT FOR THE PERSON THAT PAYS NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.  YOU MUST STAY FOCUSSED FROM START TO FINISH OR PIVOTAL CLUES TO THE MISTERY WILL QUICKLY GO AND NOT COME BACK.  A TRUE SUSPENSE.  IT WILL CERTAINLY RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT HIDDEN SECRETS MAY BE OUT THERE.  IF YOU PAY CLOSE ATTENTION YOU WILL FEEL PART OF THE STORY AND DEPPS'PARTNER AS A DETECTIVE. EXCELLENT!
B00009V7P8|5.0|Every song on this CD is wonderfully crafted and if you like the samples, you will LOVE the CD!  The full CD is so much better than the samples.  I was a bit skeptical of buying the CD by just the samples but let me tell you - WELL worth the money!!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|First, once again us Coldplay fans have to defend ourselves from the onslaught of metalheads who appears to be one person who is changing their username. This guy/girl is trying (and failing) so hard to promote  the trash known as Opeth... Seriously I listened to Ghost Reveries and I hated it... I'm not going to go and give it a 1 star review though... This idiot who keeps trying to get people to listen and praise this band Opeth should stop... The song I heard from the Opeth album had: No writing required; there was no vocal melody or any kind of melody to be heard. The engineering was laughable; The reverb on the vocals was the cheapest thing I've ever heard and the guitar was fuzzing up a bit which is a sure sign of amateurity. <br />So mister Opeth promoter please stop, no one wants to hear it. <br />X&Y, after listening to AROBTTH and Parachutes I was really obliged to buy this albumm, wasn't I? I got it and at first I thought the X side was way better than Y coz it had Square One, Talk and Speed of Sound. Speed of Sound was the first song I heard off the album, unlike most I didn't think it sounded exactly like Clocks because it didn't. Just because they both have piano lines in them doesn't mean they're the same. Both are equal I see: SOS had the better chorus while Clocks had the better piano line and Clocks had the better middle section while SOS had the better verse melody. So I always only listened to X only liking those three songs at first but then I started liking all of X after a while. White Shadows has a very long chorus and the strings on the title track are very nice and What If? has good vocal harmonies. I started noticing the songs more and they grew on me. Eventually I went on to the Y side which was hard because those songs are a lot harder to like. Stuff like A Message and Low really need to be listened to a lot but songs like Swallowed on the Sea will grab most instantly (even though it has some horrid lyrics, still a good song though). <br/>So give the album a chance and let it grow on you, play it in the background a lot and you'll start to like it. I don't find it as good as AROBTTH but it's still a solid effort. Can't wait till the next album comes out.
B0001DI0FI|3.0|Perhaps realistic enough, nevertheless very stiff and single tracked movie. Overall: Fair!
B0000508U6|4.0|I really am shocked by some of the things said by metalheads against this album... And then they go as far to say things such as \\"Try [insert bad metal band here], they're so much better than this pussy band... Chris Martin has no testicles!\\" <br />It makes me so mad when people say that Chris Martin lacks sex organs because it's just so low... It's the last resort... If you can't think of anything better to say than that, well... That's just sad and low. <br />Like I said in my AROBTTH review, this isn't a Radiohead copy, or Radiohead-Lite or whatever you like to label them. Again, I like Radiohead but sometimes they experiment their sounds almost to the point where I think they're TRYING to drive people away from them. Coldplay are much more accesible and nice. They're production is also way cleaner than Radiohead's (On Pablo Honey and The Bends that is, the rest were fairly good)and they don't write songs when they're high or intoxicated which is another plus. <br />Now the album... I heard Yellow when it first hit Australia. I thought the video was incredibly boring and I didn't really notice the song. Little did I know how much complication there was with the video and how beautiful the chorus of Yellow was. It wasn't until five years after that I noticed Coldplay proplerly. Straight after falling in love with AROBTTH I pulled this out my parents CD cupboard and put it on iTunes. At first I wasn't as drawn to it as I was with AROBTTH because it's more acoustic and some of the recordings of the songs aren't very good (The vocal track on Trouble has a lot of hiss on it, for example) but I still liked it. After more listens I actually just didn't really like High Speed (Which could have been replaced with Careful Where You Stand, I think)but the rest of the album I thought was really good. <br />Just like AROBTTH people think this is depressing. Now there are some pretty sad songs on here (We Never Change, Trouble, Spies) but they're not depressing god damnit, they're sad and melancholic. Stop trying to bring Coldplaay down on the argument that they're depressing and that Chris Martin doesn't have balls, nobody cares what you have to say except for the other people who hate Coldplay. Do you think that a Coldplay fan would read your review and actually think \\"Wow. He really doesn't have balls and they're depressing... I'm gonna go listen to [insert bad metal band here] instead because he said they were so much better.\\" <br />Just give it a rest with that stuff.
B000025SJ8|5.0|I'm sure if you're fortunate enough to be reading this, you know about the bad choices Varg has made in his life.  I have to admit, that's what lured me into actually buying this.  I was curious to see if the contraversy was all that attracted people and if it was what caused them to praise Varg's albums.  After listening to this for the first time, many years ago, it's safe to say that I was immediately amazed with the music.  The soundscapes he creates are magnificently dark and torturous.  He plays every instrument on this album, so it's safe to say that all of this music comes from one man's incredible vision.  This album, while not as cohesive as \\"Det Som Engang Var\\", still remains as my favorite Burzum recording.  \\"My Journey To The Stars\\" is absolutely beautiful.  This man is a musical genius.  He paints pictures that take you to shadowy realms you never thought existed.  For those of you that find beauty in darkness, take a look at the album cover.  Now, to me it is a beautiful picture, but if you don't think so, then maybe it's not for you.  If you do, however, perhaps you've come to the right place, because that is the kind of vision that this music gives you. If you've heard the history and are wondering what the music of a tortured artist sounds like, then this is highly recommended.  It can be an extremely rewarding experience.
B0001AVZA8|4.0|We all remember Annie Hall, but somehow in the intervening years Diane Keaton has become a very sexy lady. Her goofiness, which seemed just goofy when young, is quite endearing in a 50-something woman. Nicholson is charming but I'm not sure I saw the \\"thing\\" that made ooddles of women fall for him. Frankly, Erica, I think you made a mistake--as a 50-something myself I'd have gone with the doctor any day!
B00000AFGM|5.0|After Anti-Christ I was so excited as the rest of the world (that have taste in music that is) to see where Manson would go next.  The answer was Mechanical Animals.  The blend of metal, industrial and synth effects in amazing with Manson's talented voice.  A classic album and a worthy successor to Anti-Christ Superstar.
0571202284|5.0|This should have been required reading during my first year of college. The writing is sharp and stays interesting throughout. <br /> <br />It is strictly comprised of hand-drawn animation. Don't be afraid. I've never created a decent drawn animation, yet I've taken entire chapters of the book and applied them to a 3D character. The book will teach you the fundamentals of walk and run cycles, but just as importantly, it'll tell you just how easy and fun it is to break those conventions and do exactly the opposite. Break joints, flip feet, spin a character's head 360 degrees - he does all of those, though always referring back to the basics. <br /> <br />This shouldn't be the only animation book you own, but it should definitely be in your collection, and is probably the best introduction to animation that anyone can read.

0312965788|5.0|I have enjoyed reading this work over the years as well as the other books in the servies.  This story, autobiographical, of a English Vet just before the war, and later, after the war, is truely one of the top gems to be published over the past fifty years as far as reading pleasure goes.  The author is a natural story teller and truely a very, very good writer, actually, quite polished.  I certainly won't go into the plot or the story here as many others have already done so, but will, as I have, remark of the skill of this writer and the enjoyment his stories bring.  I admit to being one of those who have collected his work and tend to reread each book in the series ever so often.  Highly recommend this work.  I am sure you will enjoy it.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|This CD really lived up to my expectations. I think it is somewhat like the CD \\"Revolutions Per Minute\\". In my opinion, the best track is \\"Drones\\". I thought \\"Siren Song of the Counter Culture\\" was a letdown and they were getting soft, but this CD changed my mind. Even though the song \\"Ready to Fall\\" is their most popular song, I did not like it. Still, this might be their best CD yet! There is one problem, though. Most of their CDs are very similar to each other. For example, \\"Survive\\" and \\"Broken English\\" have basically indentical rhythm. I don't know if i would buy the entire CD.
0553381407|5.0|While I found this book to be extremely useful in my own situation, as I feel many others have, I do wish MY parents had read it...actually I sort of wish they had read it before I was born.  The books is well done, is down to earth and more or less tells it like it is.  Not only did I find it of great value to myself, I found it of great value is raising my own children and now grandchildren.  This work graphically points out just what parents can do to thier children, sometimes not even being aware of it.  I liked this work, found it helpful and do wish more parents would read it and more grown children burdened with some pretty bad stuff could read it.  I think it would help.  Highly recommend.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I loved the movie, so I bought the CD to go with it.  This is the best version of Chicago ever.  Everyone can really sing and sing well.  I love Catherine Zeta-Jones!  She's fantastic!  Renee did well too, I was surprised by talent.  Richard Gere too amazed me with his talent.  John C. Reilly is absolutely AMAZING doing Mister Cellophane.  Queen Latifah was great as well.  If you're not sure which Chicago soundtrack to buy, I would suggest this one over the Broadway ones, unless you want all the songs.  They cut a few songs out of the movie, but it was no major loss.  This is a great soundtrack and highly recommend it to anyone!!

B00004RFFS|5.0|`Interview With The Vampire' released in '94 is the highly anticipated film adaptation of Anne Rice's bestselling novel of the same title. This is definitely a cerebral tale for the true connoisseur of the supernatural. Yes, there is more than enough blood and dismemberment to satisfy the most ardent horror fan, but there is also so much more. Never before have we seen the mind and (dare I say) soul of a vampire so deeply examined. Never before has the emotional anxiety, mental pain and eternal agony of the damned been so thoroughly laid bare and available for scrutiny by their uninitiated mortal prey.<br /><br />Masterfully directed by Neil Jordan, the film perfectly captures the gothic atmosphere, macabre romanticism and melancholy undertones of the vampiric twilight world as found in Rice's book and subsequent screenplay.<br /><br />Add to this visual masterpiece and well-conceived storyline a superb cast featuring the very best of the undead; Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kristen Dunst and Antonio Banderas we find ourselves on the verge of a whole new genre of intelligent horror films. Vampire-Drama has arrived!
1400034779|4.0|My book club was looking for an easy stress free book after a few heavier, intense works when I found this series.  It took a couple of chapters to engage but then I fell in love with the main character and Bostwana! I bought all the other books available in the series before finishing. Clever and wholesome -I am encouraging my teenage daughters to read it too.
0385510454|2.0|I am puzzled why the author wrote about a topic he confessed of knowing so little. Except some knowledge of the Israeli Mossad, the  author doesn't seem to have a basic grasp of foreign affairs. Every Chinese student was sent to the U.S. for spying? Give me a break!
B000EDWKXI|4.0|I very much enjoyed watching Heath Ledger as Casanova, as he beds the ladies and battles the inquisition in 18th century Venice. The script sparkles with wit and the plot twists to a somewhat unexpected end. Filled with beautiful costumes and little violence unless one counts the imminent threat of hanging, Casanova provides an entertaining way to wile away a couple of hours.If you are looking for depth, look elsewhere. If what you crave is a lighthearted comedy, Casanova succeeds admirably.
B0000640SB|4.0|It is not very often that a movie will come along that can be categorized as one of the best movies in so many different movie genres, but this one can.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones act off of each other so well, and have such great comedic timing together I wish they would make more movies together.  While the comedy in this movie is not blatant and slapstick, it is good where it is in the story, and just the right amount to be considered a comedy.<br /><br />The action in this movie is great.  Mixed with the special effects it creates a movie that from beginning to end is nonstop action and adventure.<br /><br />Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones both have made great movies, and this one deserves to be in the list among their best.<br /><br />If you don't already have this one you should definitly pick it up.
B0007P3582|1.0|It's junk like this the reminds me why I normally listen to older rap from the 1990s. The only thing 50 knows how to do is run his mouth, and it's starting to backfire on him. An underground artist named Yukmouth put out an irrevocable diss calling 50 a [...] and a \\"liar\\", etc. The diss hits much harder than anything that 2Pac ever said about Bad Boy, or Jay-Z and Nas said about each other before squashing it, for example.    After all, 50 broke into the mainstream only because he dissed Ja Rule, who had actually held a good career for a few years. That was 2003, and 50 Cent had been rappin underground since 1994 or '95. Honestly, if 50 was such a prodigy, how come offbeat acts like Eminem and Xzibit hit the mainstream before 50???? Ice Cube rapped in 1995 that some people had been \\"rappin since the '70s and still never went gold\\", but why would 50 Cent wait so long?    Don't support 50 Cent. There's too much of a questionable background for me to take him seriously. You're better off dissecting some Method Man albums instead. Method Man is a classic rapper, whereas no one will even remember 50 Cent ten years from now. I personally think 2003 and later is too late for brand-new hardcore rap acts to come up.
B000A0GP18|2.0|The movie the Longest Yard staring Burt Reynolds is an absolute masterpiece, a movie that didn't need any remaking. This movie, the one starring Adam Sandler is a true shame to the original. The movie could have been made better with anyone but Sandler at the helm. The inclusion of Burt Reynolds was a litter different, don't know if he should have even had a role in the remake, was good for him to score the touchdown. This movie did have some laughs but overall I don't think that I see myself ever watching the travesty that is the remake of the Longest Yard, I'm off to watch the original and remind my self as to how much this Sandler garbage ruined it.<br /><br />Brian Bowen

0440236738|2.0|Well let's start on a positive note; Gone for Good in this reader's eyes is far from being a perfect work, oh and yes, the reviews are great.  Over-the-top reviews always surprises me on a work that is so obviously flawed as this one seems to me. I would love to praise this book as Harlen Corban can most certainly write well when he doesn't get carried away. However, in Gone for Good something went badly wrong as the author makes incredible efforts to turn on the thrills with plot and character twists that degenerate from being simply implausible to convoluted and on to farcical. There again I suppose that the author does deserve a star or two if he himself was capable of following his own up-side down, inside out and round about story line. Apart from which, there was so much boring exposition; how does it go; show, don't tell. I also had a serious problem with another of the writer's exaggerations which was over-the-top violence; but then he made amends at the end when one of the arch villains turns out to be a goofy, teary-eyed, goody-goody in disguise ... oh, come on.
B000FL7CAK|2.0|Veronica Mars was a great show... the first season. Second season was a huge disappointment. The mystery is extremely convoluted with a lot of plotlines that end up going nowhere. Season one was one of the best seasons of any television show ever because the character relationships were compelling and believable, the mini-mysteries each episode were fun, and the season-long mystery was brilliantly plotted out so we made progress each episode toward an extremely satisfying ending. <br />In season two the dialogue is still sharp and the acting is good, so it's still kinda fun to watch. But the season-long mystery is a mess that gets so complicated you need a spreadsheed to keep up and the character relationships feel tired and phony. If you haven't watched this show, just get season one. If you've watched season one, be warned that you'll be disappointed by season 2.
0385503954|5.0|I cannot believe the audacity of reviewers to give away the brilliant twists of this novel. Please do not risk spoiling some of the shine of the book by wading through these reviews. <br /> <br />Having said that, this is a favorite and the best work by a very talented author. I have enjoyed McEwan's other books, but Atonement was the most engaging. I think this was the most heartbreaking book I have ever read.  <br /> <br />The clever way the book is written is not cheap or gimmicky, and McEwan leads you along the story, telling the reader quite plainly that terrible things are going to happen. But this is not just a gloomy, ominous book. It is a wonderful love story and, obviously, a story of redemption. He called it his Jane Austen book, but I really thought it felt like the best of Hemingway, but with far more heart.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|The first time I heard the song \\"Crazy,\\" I was amazed.  I hadn't heard anything that fresh in a long time, and I was immediately captivated.  After hearing a couple more tunes from this album, I decided to buy it, and I am mostly satisfied.<br /><br />This album goes all over the place.  It has a lot of old-school R&B elements, and a lot of modern electronic production techniques, and the blend is pretty cool.  The first song is a good introduction to the album, because it is really weird.  There isn't a stable rhythm, and that is a theme which recurs throughout the album.  There is a lot jumping around, and it's best to get used to that right off the bat.<br /><br />The singles are great, of course.  \\"Crazy\\" and \\"Gone Daddy Gone\\" are both wonderful songs, with the first being soulful and the second a lot of fun.  There are a handful of songs that have a vaguely lounge or jazzy feel to them, and those songs, and others that strongly feature the vocals, usually work best.  The song \\"Transformer\\" is absolutely nuts, with a ridiculously fast beat and lots of odd changes in style between chorus and verse, and I adore it.  It's one of the most unique songs I've ever heard.<br /><br />There are a number of songs that are either too slow or too dissipated feeling, and they do detract from the overall quality of the album.  Still, of the fourteen tracks on this album, I find myself consistently listening to half of them.  I think some of the others will grow on me as I tire of my current favorites, and some of the others will just never catch on with me.
B000002UAO|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles, so of course, I remember when this album was new. It's somewhere between the innocence of the early rock n' roll days and the transition into a realm that was to become all their own. There are some lovely ballads here, notably \\"In My Life,\\" which has been covered many times by other artists (pretty well by Judy Collins), but no one does it better than the masters themselves. \\"Norwegian Wood\\" was so enigmatic and ever so slightly suggestive and subtle. Very ticklish to a teenager of the times. If you are a pup just starting your Beatles collection, get this one. Every album after this added more layers of cleverness and complexity to the body of work, but this one -- in my opinion -- represents the first layer of creative genius that was to come.
0743243153|4.0|I read this book and the sequel, People of the Lie around the time that they came out.  I was stunned by Peck's honesty. The stories of how he and his patients struggle with the problems and obstacles that confront them are amazing. <br /> <br />We don't want to hear that life is difficult. We want to buy something, toothpaste, hair dye, a new car, or find a new relationship that will make things easy for us. <br /> <br />Whenever I need some encouragement, I just find these books on my book shelf.
B000DZIGDU|1.0|I was excited to hear of this movie being set during the Iraqui conflict of 1990, and was determined to see it as soon as it hit the video market.  I expected a great war story set in the desert using all the terms, cities, and people that became common to everyone during the Gulf War.  As one who greatly enjoyed \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"Pearl Harbor,\\" and \\"Enemy at the Gates\\", I couldn't wait to see this thing.<br /><br />Flatout disliked it from the first unpleasant moments!  It just went down hill at great velocity as the focus seemed to be on how bad life is for this guy that seemed to be a suicidal candidate before he even arrived in the middle east.  The whole thing seemed to be some kind of psychological study of this one guy who mulls over the expected unfaithfulness of his girlfriend, and the necessity of attaining some kind of mindless state to survive in the military, which for him is depicted as a last, possible choice of a career.  I really am not sure what the final conclusions were for this \\"mental study\\", except that he is so disappointed when he didn't get to shoot somebody quick enough.<br /><br />Maybe I missed something in this show, but I don't think so.  It is just a very bad movie.  I highly recomend that it is skipped over by folks that enjoy the great shows like the ones I mentioned earlier.  This movie had nothing at all in it that entertained me.

B0006J28KU|3.0|\\"Heat\\" is billed as the great pairing of Pacino and DeNiro in a crime drama directed by Michael Mann, who pulls out all the tricks he perfected during his \\"Miami Vice\\" days. The only problem is that Pacino and DeNiro are only on screen together for a ten minute scene that is finely acted, but not as riveting as it should be. In fact, if memory serves, they are barely IN THE SAME SHOT. This film as its moments, but it is indicative of too many American films from this point forward: propelled more by special effects than character; overblown and overlong. If this film was CUT by 45 minutes and its story paired down, and if there were more interactions between Pacino and DeNiro's characters, this had a chance to be an enduring, classic film. Instead, Pacino is up to his old tricks, too, doing the mannered, shouting, annoying performances he's done too much of, and DeNiro is not memorable here - rent \\"Ronin,\\" which is MUCH better than this film - and the story not only lacks depth, it lacks clarity. It's almost a waste of time: an empty film, with phoned in performances, at the service of a director who is more interested in stunts and shootouts than making a coherent, classic film.
B00000IQC8|4.0|Clerks is American filmmaker Kevin Smith's directual debut. The film cost about 25,000 to make, and went on to gross 3 million at the box office -not bad at all for a first movie. Today, the movie is viewed as a cult classic, quoted by many, and revered as Kevin Smith's best film to date -even after movies with bigger budgets.    Dante Hicks, played by Brian O'Halloran, is called in to work at a New Jersey convenient store on a Saturday. He gets there to find that the shutters won't open, the customers that will walk in on that particular day all have major issues, two stoners Jay and Silent Bob, played by Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith respectively, that hang around right outside his door all day, and his next door video store clerk buddy Randal, played by Jeff Anderson, is less excited about being at work than he is. In additon to that, he had arranged plans that day to play hockey - which he ends up doing on the roof of the store, and finds out a dirty secret from his woman that explodes into a fight and a possible affair with an old flame.    The film's plot might seem pointless, but Kevin Smith's hilarious dialogue makes Clerks an enjoyable film, plus the movie is shot in black and wite that gives it a sense of coolness. The movie also introduced the world to the quirky characters Jay and Silent Bob, who would end up appearing in all of Smith's future films.     Most importantly, Clerks has become an inspiration for many young American directors to make their mark with the smallest and most affordable budget possible.    Recommended    B+
B000085RTX|3.0|This album starts with an instrumental track. That and the neat cover should tell you that your getting an accomplished Euro metal product tinged with a touch of self importance. And lo, that's just what greets the listener on this worthwhile purchase.<br /><br />Kamelot has talent to spare yet on this release their vision hadn't coalesced fully, the band still not quite nailing it. Having said that, on this album the band are already able to utilise Khans' voice to it's full effect and the musical assault is committed with the band making tasteful use of keyboards for shading.<br /><br />Salient tracks here (for me) would be the lovely Forever. A metal musical piece with a plaintive, longing lyrical bent. Wings of Despair stops and starts, swoops and soars with a tasty slice of guitar work. The Spell is a heavy rocker with a gothic trad metal atmosphere while Don't You Cry shows a tender side once more with some vocal gymnastics from Khan.<br /><br />As the record unfolds some of the tracks don't quite wash. This is why it's only a three star release - at this point the band could of been winners or losers. Luckily the developed into the former and this release is a springboard to better things. Fans of traditional metal, Euro metal and perhaps Euro hard rock should check this band out, but start at Epica or Black Halo before committing your hard earned dollar here.<br /><br />By the way - production was by Sascha Paeth and Miro - those in the know may find this tidbit of info helpful in their decision making.
B00005JOX6|3.0|Click is the latest collaborative work between director Frank Coraci and actor Adam Sandler, both have worked together on The Wedding Singer and The Waterboy. Their latest film attempts to enter new territories, fantasy and melodrama, along with the usual toilet humor. The result is a heavily cliched, predictable, and messy film that seems to lose direction and doesn't know where it is taking the viewers. <br /> <br />Click has its highlight moments- any film that has a premise involving a remote control that controls time and space is bound to have the funnies. However, the movie's message, that we learn long before midway through the film, is that family comes first. <br /> <br />Sandler plays Michael Newman, an architect who cares more about getting a promotion from his superior, played by a creepy David Hasselhoff, than spending quality time with his wife, played by Kate Beckinsale, and kids. He also has a problem using the right remote control to turn on the TV- one that turns on the ceiling fan, another that operates a toy car - which doesn't make sense (What kind of a person can't tell one remote from the other?). He drives out to a Bed Bath and Beyond, enters the Beyond section where he meets the mysterious Morty, played by Christopher Walken, who gives him a magical remote for free. The remote turns out to be a controller of Michael's life. He skips through time to when he's promoted, arguments with his wife, and sickness. The film then takes a turn into a melodramtic tale of when Michael realizes that he's skipped through very important events and struggles to go back and get things fixed. <br /> <br />It seems to me that the writers of the film were trying to be creative with the script, however, the movie turns out looking and feeling too immature. Somebody should have seriously clicked off the script and made a rewrite somewhere along the line. <br /> <br />The movie has its moments, but it's not as remarkable as Sandler and Coraci's other two films. <br /> <br />Not really recommended <br /> <br />C-
B0002IU988|4.0|Nope, not a diet Creed at all, the trio of Tremonti, Phillips and Marshall teaming up with Myles Kennedy to produce a worthy entity totally separate to their former band. Only worrying factor regarding the split is that Alter Bridge - at least on the tour for this album - have no Creed songs in their live set whilst Stapp has happily merged his new stuff with his heritage. Watch this space for the hoped for addition of maturity....<br /><br />Regardless, back to the music. In terms of tunes the band hits its' straps right away. Find the Real, One Day Remains and Open Your Eyes all working a steady charm on the listener in a way that is both modern but also very much in the sort of 'classic' hard rock vein that was somewhat missing in Creed.<br /><br />Muscular riffs to match Kennedys voice about but that's not to say the band doesn't know how to marry a serious melody to their wattage, Metalingus being a case in point. The aforementioned track is also an example of the optimism that rears it's head on a regular basis, a feeling of a beautiful day after a storm.<br /><br />Buy with confidence
B00005JNRY|5.0|I just have to say, \\"Cars\\" is yet another great and exciting film from Pixar. <br />The storyline is very great, and having a world of cars and no people whatsoever is very cool. <br />The movie is also very humorous, with unforgetable charecters like Mater the towtruck and Lightning McQueen the famous racecar. <br />Kids will love this movie, and so will adults. <br />From what i've heard, it's gonna come out on dvd in November of this year, so I can't wait!
006056251X|5.0|you are going to need them. A beautiful, romantic and very very sensual book.     I adored both Sebastian and Evie. And love how from early on they are transformed by their love for each other. Becoming the people they really were inside.  Loved every second of it!!!!!!  Can't say enough about this book!!!! Lisa Kleypas at her best!!!
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Alright! For those of you who like metal, you should at least know this band whether you like them or not. For us metal heads, Iron Maiden is a classic outfit right up there with Kizz, Judas Priest, and AC/DC. Brave New World is their second most recent studio album, with Dance of Death being the latest record.   For me, BNW is my favorite followed by Number of the Beast cd.  Now for the song by song review: <br /> <br /> <br />1. The Wicker Man-  4:35 <br /> <br />The Wicker Man is your typical Iron Maiden album opener. Its short, with very catchy guitar rythems and lyrics that are easy to sing along to. Bruce Dickenson does a chant at the end of the song that can easily get 5,000 people singing with him. <br /> <br />2. Ghost of the Navigator-  6:50 <br /> <br />Steve Harris seems to have a passion for the ocean or something, must like to go fishing :). This song starts out slow and very melodic, almost easy to dance to. But then it gets heavy, yet somehow manages to keep its melodic feel through out the song. Bruce sings pretty heavy, even seems like he has a growl at a few points, and he does another chant at the end of this one, but not as long as the one on \\"The Wicker Man\\". <br /> <br />3. Brave New World-  6:18 <br /> <br />This song also starts out slow, and Bruce shows the emotional side of his voice here. About a 1:30 through however, the song explodes into a fast paced melody with Bruce's vocals soaring on the high notes. There's some awesome guitar riffing that Adrian Smith and Dave Murray do in the middle of the song, easily chanted to. One of my favorites on the cd. <br /> <br />4. Blood Brothers-  7:14 <br /> <br />Yep, another song that starts out slow, and pretty much stays that way through out the entire tune.  All thought it stays melodic, its still a catchy and very emotional song, I believe it is dedicated to those who have supported the band, and that have supported metal. After all, in the world of heavy metal, we're all Blood Brothers, no matter the differences between us. Because we all share the same passion. I believe thats the message this song is trying to send out, at least that's what it means to me. <br /> <br />5. The Mercenary-  4:42 <br /> <br />Ah, now we're back to the classic butt kicking that Iron Maiden has become known for. A short, sweet, and fast paced melody and a story that obviously about the mercenary. Again, there's some awesome guitar work done on the track. The only thing I do not like about this song is that the Chorus gets very repetetive. This song reminds me of their classic hit: \\"Wrath Child\\"a lot. <br /> <br />6. Dream of Mirrors- 9:21 <br /> <br />This is one of the three epics on the album as you can tell by the time. It starts out rockin' with Bruce belting out: \\"Have you ever felt, the future is the past? But you don't know how?!...\\" A minute  later the song slows down to accoustic status, but still carrys' its catchy vibe. Then it explodes again, and pretty much stays on that pattern through out the song. Its Another one of my favorite songs on this cd, I love the chants that Bruce does in between the Chorus and  the great guitar solos. <br /> <br />7. The Fallen Angel- 4:00 <br /> <br />And some more butt kicking with \\"The Fallen Angel\\".  This is the song to set your alarm to in the morning, I gaurentee it will wake you up.  A cool song that can be easily sung to. <br /> <br />8. The Nomad- 9:06 <br /> <br />Iron Maiden takes us in a different direction with this song.  It has an awesome middile eastern feel through out its length. With a mixture of fast paced melody and emotional, melodic segements, and some hints of orchestration,  it will keep you listening to the very end. <br /> <br />9. Out of the Silent Planet- 6:25. <br /> <br />Another repetitive song, but not in an annoying way like \\"The Mercanary\\". It starts out melodic, and then goes to accoustic mode, but then enflames into a fast paced epic that keeps you awake nearing the end of a long work day. Thisis another one that's easily sung to and one of my favorites.  <br /> <br />10. The Thin Line Between Love and Hate-  8:26 <br /> <br />My all time favorite Iron Maiden song right here! Naturally, the band saves the best tune for last.  The melody starts out slow but decently fast, reminds me a lot of the opening to their \\"Fear of The Dark\\" song. Then it gets rocking, oddly enough, this is arguably one of their most emotional songs to date. It questions our worlds societies and life in general. Such examples from the lyrics are: \\"We all like to put the blame, on Soceity these things. But what kind of good or bad, that each generation brings.\\"  and: \\"Just a few small tears between, some one happy and one sad. Just a thin line drawn between, beeing a genius or insane.\\" Its meaningful lyrics like these that what makes this song number one on my list. <br /> <br />Overall, Brave new world is a good release by the Maidens, I highly recommend getting it if you're a fan of metal and rock in general. <br /> <br />I hope you enjoyed the review, <br />Parker.
B0006284JQ|3.0|Ever since Britney Spears hit the music scene, the controversy has surrounded the pop princess. Yet it is hardly the music which has been in focus for the last couple of years, instead various tabloid headlines have dominated Britney's public persona. However, Britney Spears has released four studio albums and some excellent pop songs. So in 2004, a greatest hits saw the light of day. One may argue that the release of a greatest hits album after less than 7 years in the music business is a tad hasty and I tend to agree.    <br /> <br />The throbbing My Prerogative welcomes the listener to a Bobby Brown cover. The song was released in order to promote the greatest hits album, landing Britney a considerable hit in Europe. The funky, infectious cut is a guilt-pleasure of mine, however it will not be considered a memorable song, in my opinion, as the original is far superior. Next up is the teasingly Toxic. The spy-like theme and the catchy chorus are the highlights of the song. It is probably one of the best pop songs to have been released within the last 6 years. It certainly proved that Britney had not lost the potential to release a hit song. The sexy, addictive I'm A Slave For You from the Britney album was produced by the producer-team The Neptunes. Its funky sound and the mourn-like noises are a perfect match for one another: however, some may argue that the raunchy theme and the mourning sound are a tad overdone.  <br /> <br />Released in 2000, the Oops...I Did It Again album witnessed a different Britney from her previous album Baby One More Time. The red-cat suit for the first single Oops...I Did It Again had people interested - positively and negatively. Admittedly, the song is extremely catchy but the horrible lyrics and Britney's irritating voice ruin the song completely. The song's mechanical sound does nothing to interest me. In general, I'm not a very big fan of Max Martin productions as they sound to homogenise for my liking. Next up is the blend Me Against The Music from Britney's most mature album In The Zone. Surely, a collaboration between Madonna and Britney should generate a better result than this rather dull track. The self-confident Stronger is a more tolerable Max Martin/Rami production, displaying a Britney with attitude. The haunting and heartfelt Everytime, allegedly a response to her then-boyfriend Justin Timberlake, showcases Britney's attempt to tackle serious topics, which works quite well.  <br /> <br />Released in 1999, the Baby One More Time album produced several hits for the pop princess, which included Baby One More Time, (You Drive Me) Crazy and Sometimes. The songs display happy, bubbly pop song: however, the only song which truly stands out from Britney's debut album is the fantastic Baby One More Time. Even the most avid Britney hater must admit: it is a brilliant pop song. Sure, Britney Spears' music has a tendency to sound rather mechanical at times, especially her earlier material; however, her In the Zone album displays a more wholesome sound than her previous albums. Moving onto the Janet-esque Boys, showcasing a seemingly more naughty Britney - surely, the `'sweet'', `'innocent'' Britney was long gone then. Britney's voice leaves much to desire, however Boys displays how Britney is able to use her vocal skills to the fullest. Overprotected, the dreadful I Love Rock `N' Roll and I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman, taken from the Britney album, are blend pop offerings. Many may disagree with me; however I'm Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman is simply awful - the lyrics are simply laughable. Lucky is another example of horrible lyrics - do people actually get paid for writing this kind of material and people like this? Outrageous, I've Just Begun (Having My Fun) and Do Something are tolerable songs, but they are not among my fave Britney songs.  <br /> <br />The Greatest Hits: My Prerogative is a mixed bag. Admittedly, it contains several good pop songs, yet much of  Britney's material/music istoo weak for a greatest hits - a few more studio albums with stronger material to be included are lacking on this greatest hits. Toxic, Baby One More Time, I'm A Slave For You, Stronger and Stronger are the best songs on the album, im my opinion. People, however, who adore Britney's music will be thrilled with this greatest hits - if you like happy, bubbly pop music, Britney's Greatest Hits is just the album for you.    <br /> <br />Overall Rating: 5.5/10
B0007P3582|3.0|Get rich or die tryin' was a solid album. This album is average and as a fan of 50 he could have done better. He has a few good tracks like I'm suppose to die tonight , piggy bank, outta control,get in my car, and position of power. 50 knows he didn't gives his best in this album and should take his time on his next album and show why he sold 11 million on his first LP.
B0006Z2KYI|5.0|There is a certain sense of melancholy I feel when I watch this 1942 classic Ernst Lubitsch movie, as it represents the last appearance of the luminous Carole Lombard, surely the most breathtaking and high-spirited of actresses during Hollywood's golden era. In a rush to get home to husband Clark Gable after a successful war bond tour, she died in a plane crash during the film's post-production, and as the result proves without a doubt, the world lost one of the great treasures of the silver screen. She and co-star Jack Benny play Maria and Joseph Tura, the egocentric stars of a Polish acting troupe who are caught in the 1939 Nazi invasion of Warsaw. As a world-class flirt, she is carrying on with a handsome young pilot named Stanislav Sobinski, and their trysts begin once he hears his cue to get up from his theater seat, Hamlet's famous opening line to his soliloquy as spoken by an increasingly perturbed Joseph.<br /><br />The romantic triangle quickly takes a backseat to an espionage thriller involving a German spy named Professor Siletsky, who holds the names of members of the Polish underground. His intention is to kill them, but the acting troupe, now with their theater in ruins, band together to stop him. This includes the need for the extremely vainglorious Joseph to impersonate Siletsky in front of the befuddled Colonel Ehrhardt and for Maria to seduce any Nazi official who stands in their way. While it sounds like a piece of wartime propaganda, the film actually becomes more farcical even as people are getting killed.<br /><br />As Joseph, Benny has never been better, conveying both self-absorption and cunning expertly, and the script by  Edwin Justus Mayer and an uncredited Lubitsch gives him a number of great one-liners. With her honey-toned voice and smoky elegance, Lombard is at the top of her game as the seductive Maria, as she dexterously shows her comic and dramatic sides with precision and unparalleled style. Delivering her lines with subtle finesse, she provides a strong match for Benny. Sixty-four years later, and there is still no one who can touch her. The rest of the ensemble is memorable starting with Sig Ruman's hilarious turn as Ehrhardt. A fresh-faced Robert Stack, all of 22, plays Sobinski with a callow, zestful energy, while Felix Bressart excels as the ultimately heroic Greenberg.<br /><br />The movie makes direct commentaries on the concentration camps, and the satirical aspects are blissfully unapologetic. The stylishness of the comedy in light of the virulent wartime setting is what makes the film memorable and it proves what a master Lubitsch was at this level of subtlety. The 2005 DVD comes with two extras both featuring Benny - an ancient twenty-minute comedy short from 1930 called \\"The Rounder\\" and a brief commercial for war bonds. I wish they could have included some tribute to Lombard as it would have been fitting on this disc.strong match for Benny. Sixty-four years later, and there is still no one who can touch her.

B00004RF8J|5.0|This movie is freakin' WEIRD! Thankfully, I like weird. For the uninitiated, this is a musical about a man-eating plant (voiced by Levi Stubbs of The Four Tops). It must be seen to be believed. Our hero, Seymour, discovers a never-before-seen plant, naming it Audrey II (after his coworker and love interest, Audrey). Turns out, the plant eats humans, as he learns when it drinks his blood. At first, Seymour befriends the plant, who helps him get around Audrey's boy friend, a sadistic dentist (the song about him and pseudo-S&M scene that result are freakin' hilarious!) Eventually, things get out of hand - the plant's uniqueness earns Seymour much fame, even though nobody is aware of the plant's dangers. When the plant eats Seymour's boss, things get out-of-hand, and the final battle between the two is hilarious also - Levi Stubbs offers his amazing pipes, declaring \\"I'm a mean, green mutha from outer space!\\" - one of my favorite movie quotes. This movie is a real side-splitter, and must be seen!
B00000IQW3|4.0|This was always one of my all time favorite sci-fi movies of the time, and still is.  The special effects of the time were pretty impresive.  It wasn't a \\"Star Wars\\", but it didn't have that size budget either.  It was very entertaining, and that's what it's all about, isn't it?  I highly reccommend it if you're into sci-fi, and even if you're not.
B00005A46T|1.0|Call it nu-metal, death-metal... whatever. But it still sucks. Why? For one, I listen to a CD to hear MUSIC, not the mindless ravings of the socially inept set to some rap-type beat. These guys really should look into some therapy, not put out pointless records. And it's not even HEAVY METAL! Hendrix, Cream, Led Zeppelin, AC/DC... that's some REAL metal. Hell, even the Beatles recorded heavier songs! (Helter Skelter would probably make Slipknot's heads explode, thus ridding us of one of rock's worst bands). And I'm not prejudiced toward any genre of music whatsoever- I listen to everything from John Coltrane to Otis Redding to the Beatles to AC/DC to Muddy Waters, so don't say it's because I'm \\"Anti-metal\\". I'm anti-Slipknot, that's all.
0735619670|4.0|I have spent the last few weeks reading this book.  On one hand the book is easy to read and presents a lot of good material.  But it really reflects mainly what I learned in my undergraduate curriculum.  I did not see a lot of new material, but I have also met many who did not practice these things.  The best thing about the book is the checklists.  They are great starting points for making your own checklists and put together a lot of things that are easy to overlook in the moment of creation.
B00004XOWM|1.0|The blatantly immature, homophobic, trashy joke that is the album's title is even less funny than the old standby \\"Why did the chicken cross the road?\\", and the band itself is just as predictable. Don't let Fred Durst get away with his version of \\"music\\", buy some Beatles or AC/DC instead.
B000EOTAM6|1.0|Very loosely based on the animation and lacking its charm, I thought this film should not have been made. I like Charlize Theron and perhaps with a decent script, better direction, some Aeon Fluxy sets and first class wire stunts they could have gotten a lot closer to the title animation's style and energy. This film starts smoothly but disolves into cliche and lack of scenery. I felt like I had wasted my time watching this turkey.
0066620996|5.0|This is an awsome book! I thought Patrick M. Lencioni was a good writer, but Jim Collins is a Great writer! The research and the detail in this book is unheard of. Mr. Collins and his team did a great job in explaining every part of this book in great detail. If you want to become a better leader, in any field, read this book.
1400032717|4.0|While I don't think it's possible to \\"get inside\\" the mind of an autistic child, and while I had some issues with the way Haddon portrayed somethings, the book is quite enjoyable, entertaining, and a very quick read.
B000084T18|5.0|Im not a big fan of 50. But i have to admit i can listen to every song without skiping a single one.
0553062182|5.0|There is not a whole lot to say except that it was very enlightening and I am looking forward to reading her other book, The Highly Sensitive Person in Love, or something like that.
B00004RFFS|5.0|I know, I am not a gothic freak, but this movie was awsome, it really had a great story, cool special effects.  This was much better then Queen of the Damned.  I  really like vampire stuff, because it keeps me interested in the genre, reading  books about them, not only that this film takes you into a different time, into a world of darkenss beyond the one we live day by day. I thought Brad, Tom, Antonio, made a great blood sucking team.  Kristin Dunst did a job well done for her first bite, on film.  She pulled it off so well, that she freaked me out the first time I saw her in it. The setting in New Orleans, and the farm, was setting the mood right. The cemitery scenes were, really creepy. It was really cool, how they showed you, as the years pasted, and how they survived and how they must feed to keep on living. This movie was a thrill ride, its perfict for the Halloween season.  Even thou it had alot of blood, hey whats a vampires life with out blood? This is not a kids movie, so be \\"warned\\".  It's a story mix with every element in it, love, betrayal, death, and mystery, and action. This film will be on top along with the rest of  my vampire/Dracula movie collection.  I give this one 5 stars becuse it has the best actors in it, has a great story, that's all that matters. It  was told very well, how a vampire lives, not only get to see what a vampire goes though and how he lives with the rest of humanity and how he must make a choice to kill to live longer. This movie will have you come out more at night for longer bites... SJ
B0007OASII|5.0|I had heard a lot of great things about Kamelot, but I never had gotten around to purchasing any albums by them. That all changed after the release of The Black Halo. I absolutely had no idea what I was missing out on. Most people label power metal as cheesy, complete with tales about dragons and princesses and ridiculously high male vocals. I urge non power metal fans to set aside whatever keeps them from enjoying the genre. Kamelot are from the United States (yes, they are) and The Black Halo was one of the best overall releases from 2005.<br /><br />The album starts out on a darker side with the slower but ominous 'March of Mephisto.'  This song took me by surprise, as I had no clue what I was in store for. Also, Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir makes a guest appearance on this album, making things sound dark on 'March of Mephisto' and 'Memento Mori.' The song 'When the Lights are Down' is catchy and fun while 'Soul Society' is very gripping, asking tough questions about the spiritual side of life after death. 'Abandoned' is simply one of the most beautiful songs that I have ever heard. 'Moonlight' is another beautiful track with an ethereal chorus.<br /><br />This was the first purchase of Kamelot in my collection, and I guaruntee you that it will not be my last. I have heard wonderful things about the albums Epica and Karma. Kamelot display an immense talent in all aspects of their music. Intelligent lyrics and serious power metal styles mix for a synergy that has attracted music fans that generally do not listen to metal. I plan on seeing Kamelot when they make their stop into Los Angeles this October for their 2006 tour. Please support this band! The Black Halo was one of my favorite purchases overall in 2005.
B0000639FE|3.0|There are two versions of Jerry Maguire on DVD out there.  A single disc edition you'll find in just about any store, and this 2-Disc Set.  Right off the bat, if you're a die-hard fan of Cameron Crowe or this film, spring for the 2-Disc.  It has commentary between the four stars (Crowe, Cruise, Zellwegger and Gooding Jr.) that's a fun listen, but not all that informative.  There's some rehearsal footage that's pretty neat to look at, if you're into the pre-production stuff as well as 4 deleted scenes, all with optional commentary.  Rounding out this set is a fake commercial by Rod Tidwell, a short interview with a real sports agent, a 7 minute fluff piece and the music video for Secret Garden (as well as trialers and whatnot). <br /> <br />It's an okay Special Edition.  The extras aren't going to blow you away and I doubt I'm going to watch them again.  The movie, on the other hand, is great so as far as I can tell, you can't go wrong either way.  Fanatics, elitists and completists . . . this set is for you.  Those content with just the film, the single disc set will be just fine.
B000002LND|5.0|This truly is a greatest hits album, because not all of the Queen of Pop's hits could be included on this album because she had so many. Among those missing are Dress You Up, Angel, True Blue, Who's That Girl, Causing A Commotion, Oh Father, Keep it Together, and Hanky Panky. It plays almost as a none-stop dance album with the exception of the ballads \\"Crazy For You\\" and \\"Live To Tell\\". It's amazing to hear her transition from cute bubblegum pop starlet with songs like \\"Borderline\\" to the sexual icon of \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Justify My Love\\". No wonder this album sold an amazing 10.8 million in just the U.S. alone and an amazing 25 million worldwide. <br />It begins with a slight remix of the song that put her on the map (all the songs are slightly remixed), \\"Holiday (#16 on the Hot 100) and then moves into 3rd hit from \\"Madonna\\" (the 1983 debut album), \\"Lucky Star\\" (#4) which isn't such a great song, so I'm glad it is shortened. Then we move into her 2nd hit and first top 10, \\"Borderline\\" which introduced the world to great pop music.  <br />The \\"Like A Virgin\\" era introduces Madonna as the sexy boy toy with hits like \\"Like A Virgin\\" (#1) and \\"Matiriel Girl\\" (#2) and from the film \\"Vision Quest the number 1 ballad \\"Crazy For You\\". <br />After the successful theme song from Vision Quest, Madonna sang the theme song from her husband Sean Penn's movie \\"At Close Range\\", \\"Live To Tell\\" (#1) which reinvented Madonna as a mature and sexy blonde bombshell with a beautiful voice. However, it wasn't long until controversy was stirred with the lyrics to the powerful \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" (#1). \\"Open Your Heart\\" (#1) showed Madonna as a sexy stalker while \\"La Isla Bonita\\" (#4) showed the Spanish side to the Madge.  <br />She became more daring with the combination of sex and religion in \\"Like A Prayer\\" (#1) and took a stand for women in \\"Express Yourself\\" (#2). \\"Cherish\\" (#2) could lift anyone from the darkness with its light feel.  <br />Then came the wonderful dance track \\"Vogue\\" (#1)which made Madonna an Icon and the most famous person in 0the entire world. It also inspired a dance craze all around the world. <br />Controversy continued with the Immaculate Collection's new track which contained a slightly sexual video which hinted at sadomasochism, \\"Justify My Love\\". It was this 1990 #1 song with it's sexy video that I consider the best song of all-time. It's simply a classic.  <br />The album ends with popular dance number \\"Rescue Me\\"(#9) which sounds like a mixture if \\"Vogue\\" and \\"Justify\\". It was during this area Madonna was her most popular and these songs and the acts that came along with them are still talked about even today.
B000DN6ZGC|5.0|It was love at first listen. When I heard Corrine Bailey Rae on The Stix' single \\"Young & Foolish\\", I knew I'd be seeing and hearing her again.<br /><br />Her debut album doesn't disappoint and is full of light, breezy & summery tunes enhanced by her pure, easy going vocals and sparse, careful production. If you've heard her lead single \\"Put Your Records On\\" I can tell you it only hints at the magic on the album. I love all the songs but tunes to really watch out for apart from the aforementioned might include: \\"Till It Happens to You\\", \\"Call Me When You Get This\\", Choux Pastry Heart\\", \\"I'd Like To\\", \\"Butterfly\\" and my definite favourite; \\"Breathless\\". Note also, the gospel-influenced lament \\"Seasons Change\\" that brings the album to an achingly beautiful close.<br /><br />Great for barbecues, intimate summer evenings or even just chilling with a cold drink on a warm summer's night. Definitely one of the better singers to emerge this year - and she's from my hometown!
1400079179|5.0|What an excellent read.  I loved having the paperback, because I read this before and during my travels to Europe.  How fun it was to recognize several of the places Dan Brown writes about in his book, and see the historic buildings and streets that the characters experienced their adventures on.  It is obvious he has done his research of the locations where the story takes place, and also extensive research of the history of Christianity.<br /><br />I couldn't put this book down.  Even if you don't agree whether the content is true, it is so well-written you can't wait to get back to finding out what happens next.  Read this book with an open mind, and it may just change the way you look at the world for the better.  It did mine.
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I recently saw the uncut 293 min version and was pleased to see that the additional footage added even more depth to an already amazing piece of film...you can read my original review of this film under the \\"directors cut\\" that I wrote yesterday, and whether you choose to believe or disbelieve what I referred to in my past is your choice.
B00000IL67|5.0|This is the most comprehensive set ever put together of Alice coopers vast catolog, starting with his \\"pretty for you\\" and \\"easy Action\\" years through the last of his sony years with \\"last temptation\\".  It even has some of the rare B-sides thrown in, such as \\"no tricks\\" and \\"because\\". It even include stuff from the Flush the fashion, zipper catches skin, special forces, DADA ablum that were lost in the mid 80's suffle and only available by import.  This is a flat out awesome collection, must have for any true alice fan, and a great starter set for the new collector. Don't forget his newer stuff (spitfire albums) such as his brutal planet album, a great change and adaptation of alice into the 21st century, or his Dirty diamond, which rekindles some of his classic sounds.
B00012FXAE|5.0|We'll keep this one simple:<br /><br />-'Aliens' is the greatest action movie of all-time, and it's not a bad horror movie either.  It's one of the more unremittingly intense movies of all-time.  The final third is just relentless and even the various slow parts have an undeniable electricity to them, even after like 10 viewings on my part.<br /><br />-'Aliens' is an absolute masterpiece of practical special effects.  The aliens themselves, the set-design, the props, the costumes etc.  All brilliant.  The combination of all the disparate elements may not be completely seamless, but it's surprisingly close, and a helluva lot more convincing than the total CGI films inflicted on us so much nowadays.  (I'm not one of those knee-jerk opposed to CGI people. I just don't think you should use it when it can be done well with practical effects, which is, naturally, opposed to the modern practice of using it at all times and for all things for no apparent reason.)<br /><br />-It's got some atypically memorable good characters and acting for an action/sci-fi/horror movies.  Yeah, many of them are kinda cliched, but they're good well-done cliches, anyway.  Weaver really comes into her own as Ripley, making her quite a bit more interesting and likable than she was the first time around while still basically seeming like the same person.  Furthermore, Michael Biehn and Lance Henricksen give their definitive performances.<br /><br />-If, for some reason or another, you've never actually seen 'Aliens', I would recommend you actually watch the theatrical cut first.  Once you already know the overall plot the Director's Cut is better, and all the stuff that's added in is cool, but I think it tips its hand a little too early, and it's best not to give away that much info the first time around.  Not that it matters much either way, but I think this would be the better way to do it.<br /><br />Yeah, I'm done.  This movie's awesome.  Watch it or be lame forever.<br /><br />Grade: A
B00065JTBA|5.0|This collection is an interesting compilation of many B-side songs and unreleased tracks by bon jovi over the 20+ years. Just to warn casual lookers, this set is not a greatest hits compilation, so don't buy it on a whim if you expect to get those song you like so much on the radio.  This is truly intended as a set for fans that want to get all of bon jovi's music, and now have a chance to get their backlog of B-sides and unreleased material.  The one song that blows me out of the water (as explained on the DVD) is \\"edge of a broken heart\\", on the movie soundtrack \\"Disorderlies\\" that stared the Fat boys.  This song was cut from the Slippery when Wet album, a fate that Livin' on a prayer almost had, saved at the last second.  The DVD in this set explains it all. Many of the song are from unreleased material compiled from the two prior albums bounce and crush, but it has many other songs on their as well. Agian, a great addition of bon jovi material to a fans collection, many very good songs that could have made any album, and some that could have been hits if released. They could have sat on this material for a while longer and milked us with albums of this stuff, but the busy boys from New Jersey truly gave us a reward and released this box set as a whole, and moved on to new material. Imagine in 20 more years another box set. The guys must do nothing but write.  \\"HAVE A NICE DAY\\"
B000B8QF14|5.0|After seeing Bullet in a Bible on FUSE, I knew that I needed to get this CD/DVD. Some may disagree with Samuel Bayer's choice in camera changes during the movie but I personally didn't find any problem with it. It sort of captures the spirit of the band itself, coming at you from many directions and you never know what's going to happen next. Green Day is AWESOME in concert and this DVD is evidence of it. From Billie Joe's crazy antics in St. Jimmy to his heroic and heartfelt performance of Wake Me Up When September Ends, Green Day shows it's versatility as a band and their highly polished skills as musicians/entertainers.  <br /> <br />The CD, however,  is the star of the show here. It's a showcase of 14 of Greenday's greatest songs, as well as a great cover of Shout. My personal favorite among the live versions of these classic songs is Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)It puts an awesome twist to Green Day's Anthemic juggernaut of a song (it was featured on Seinfeld!) The song serves as a great conclusion to an awesome journey down Green Day's career. It's Just Billie Joe, his electric guitar, and a crowd of over 10,000 people. You've got to check out the interaction between Billie and the crowd on the DVD, It's Amazing.  <br /> <br />The only real Gripe I had was that they could have packed on a couple extra tunes. My picks would be Welcome to Paradise, Christie Road and Who Wrote Holden Caulfield, all of which were in their Comp'd concert on FUSE. Oh well. Go out and buy this if you need proof of Green Day's talent. Don't buy it if your allergic to great alternative/punk music!
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I LOVE this CD!  Put this one on, get a glass of wine, relax and get ready to get in touch with your soul.  Yes, it's that good!  I have had this CD for 2 weeks now and I think I've already worn it out.  I've bought several copies for friends and tell everyone about it.  Ms. Rae's voice is like satin.  Feels good after a long, hard day of work.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|I've read a few reviews that complain the movie is too confusing and needs to be viewed more than once.  I found the film to be complex, yet the general theme of oil/greed/international intrigue/politics was pervasive and held it together nicely.  It therefore is enjoyable seeing it a couple of times - always something new to pick up on. Great stuff!!! <br />If you enjoy this, read Robert Baer's book 'See No Evil.'
B000002UV1|4.0|This is the album that introduced me to the Red Hot Chili Peppers. And I can tell you, it totally blew me away! From the album cover, to its mix of punk, funk, rap and rock, to four guys dancing around the stage in their underwear, it was like nothing I'd seen or ever heard before. Along with Blood Sugar Sex Magik, this was to define who I am today.I grew up listening to songs on this record, and today, 16 years later, they still mean as much to me as they did back then.<br />This was the bands first commercial success, and of course the introduction of John Frusciante and Chad Smith. Only John could have filled the void left behind by Hillel Slovack, and it is clear on this album Hillel was one of his biggest influences. I doubt the Red Hot Chili Peppers would have ever tasted the success they have, had it not been for John, as he brings something more to the band.<br />And then of course there's Chad, who hits the drums harder than anybody. Flea's bassline lays the foundation, you can feel all of his energy being poured into the making of this record, while Anthony has a couple of his best lyrical efforts on here. (Knock me down, Taste The Pain).<br />While this album may not be as good as the ones that followed, (with the exception of 'One Hot Minute', of course) it is certainly a good aquisition for anybody who jumped on the post 'blood sugar' bandwagon.<br />A couple of songs on here (Stone Cold Bush & Johnny,Kick A Hole In The Sky) will leave you breathless, while a couple (Magic Johnson & Nobody Weird Like Me) could have easily been left off the album and not missed.<br />Overall, a very good effort nonetheless...It definitely set the stage for what was to come.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|This movie was wonderfully written (Kazushige Nojima) and directed (Tetsuya Nomura, Takeshi Nozue). The music score was incredible (Nobuo Uematsu, see my review of the soundtrack), and the animation is the best ever seen... yet still something is missing that doesn't give this movie the edge to get a five. It's probably the story, and the characters. The plot isn't very complex, and the characters aren't very deep. I never actually felt for any of the characters, making the movie less dramatic. But, it was great in all other regards.  The battle scenes are my favorite part. Five movements happen in one second, people leap about and fight in mid-air (just a warning: the action is anime-style, a.k.a. physics-defying), and motorcycles fly through the air in a flury of amazing CG animation; absolutely incredible. Especially the final battle; Cloud, the main character, against Sephiroth, the coolest villain ever. Since Sephiroth can soar about effortlessly, and has so many other powers, it makes the battle the best I've ever seen. Just watch it and behold its greatness.  The story does deserve some complements, but it's not that great. I love the use of old elements of Final Fantasy VII that weren't covered much in the game. Of course, if you haven't played the game, you wouldn't know what these are. Speaking of that, you don't need to have played the game to understand the story. It is explained in the movie.  This movie is definitely a must-see, but could also definitely be better. Personally, it is my second favorite movie.
0875845851|2.0|After slogging all the way through this book, I came to Amazon, expecting to see a low rating. I am surprised to see that it has 4.5 stars (as of when I'm writing this review) and a lot of positive comments. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the author did take some interesting ideas and combine them in a way that makes sense. I don't mind the hours I spent reading this book because at least it made me think about a couple of things I hadn't realized before. <br /> <br />But on the other hand... there are really only a few important concepts in this book, and you can see what they are by reading a couple of the longer reviews here (like Coert Visser's or the one from \\"Dr. Professor Hossein Arsham.\\" There's no need to read the whole thing unless you want to hear those same concepts explained over and over again.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I laughed.  I cried.  Who knew movie popcorn cost so much?    The theatre lights dropped... and then came Serenity.    I laughed.  I cried.  I cheered with the crowd.  I was on the edge of my seat.  I fell off my seat.    Thankfully it is dark in theaters.    Serenity, the much anticipated capstone to the beloved television series Firefly (inexplicable left at the alter by network arch villain FOX) exploded from the screen as I sat reveling in nothing less than rapture.    Who knew movies could be so fun?    I knew.  I remember my first screening of Star Wars.  We were five minutes late and I nearly died from the agony.  Then...magically... I was somewhere else.  I was in a galaxy far, far away.    Fast forward nearly 30 years to that shiny moment, when once again, I was far, far away.  This time courtesy of Serenity's brilliant cast of characters, plot twists that sprayed loose change from my pockets, pulse-jamming special effects, spine-tingling creepiness, guffaw-evoking wit, and just enough heart, soul, and camaraderie to inspire even the faithless.    That, in a nutshell, is Serenity.    I loved it.    p.s.  In a slightly more comprehensive nutshell, the movie Serenity is the sweeping finale to Josh Whedon's amazing space/western epic: Firefly.  After rewatching Serenity, it is now my advice to begin your adventure, not with it, but with the television series Firefly.  Beg, borrow, or buy Firefly and its truly gifted ensemble cast and then experience Serenity.  Otherwise, I'm not sure a person new to Whedon`s \\"verse\\" can fully appreciate all of the plotlines and nuances jam-packed into this stunning finale. To be fair to new viewers, Firefly and Serenity do have an occasional hard - but realistic - edge, so it may behoove you to preview the series before buying.  That said, Firefly/Serenity is, bar none, my favorite science fiction series of all time.
1860498825|5.0|Sarah Waters weaves an amazing tale with so many twists and turns that the pages practically turn themselves!!!<br /><br />Fingersmith is the story of a young pickpocket who becomes involved in a scheme to steal the inheritance of a young woman of whom it is said is quite naive.  The plan seems simple enough but then things become a bit jumbled.  Feelings of loyalty to many different factions collide, and the path seems less clear than in the beginning.  This is a gorgeously written story of love, hardship, sensuality, betrayal and loyalty that takes you down a passage that becomes more and more blurred. No one is sure whose side they are on. No one is even sure where each side begins or ends.  Sarah Waters is a truly gifted writer.
0670036536|5.0|I had read Baskervilles years ago but no longer had a copy, so I bought this.  It was extremely interesting with the sidebars of information, culture for that time period, explanations of geological and historical locations, customs, the science and technology for the time, just so much extra knowledge!  It was wonderful!
B000F7CMRW|5.0|I saw this movie one night in a hotel while traveling and as soon as it was released..I had to buy it.  George C is amazing in this role and the moment-to-moment story line unfolding will keep you engrossed.
0670034711|5.0|Elizabeth Gilbert is a poet. I read her book practically non-stop for three days, laughing out loud, crying (crying even more now that I loaned my only copy out!), and feeling so inspired by her courage and resilience, I cashed in all my frequent flier miles (that I was saving for my when-I-meet-Mr.-Right honeymoon) and signed up for surf lessons in Bali - something I've always dreamed about. What made this book all the more personal to me was that for weeks after reading it, I looked for Indian prayer beads to help me meditate and sleep at night. I could only find plastic ones, and finally gave up. About a month later, I had the opportunity to house-sit a small orchard in Kauai with a friend. Driving up to the house on the site, my friend said, \\"I forgot to tell you, there is a really cool tree on the site - it's a blue marble tree. It's from India, and it's said that if you hug the tree, it takes away your worries, and these little blue marble-shaped fruits are the tears it cries for you... also,\\" she said, \\"the seeds from the fruits are what they use to make Indian prayer beads.\\" It's funny, how things are all connected in strange and magical ways. But then, I think Gilbert knows all about that sort of thing. :)
B000EWBC4C|5.0|This album is not very well know for a lot of people even fans of the early <br />days. Produced after \\"Welcome\\" it as the same spirit then \\"Caravanseraï\\" and sound closely to it even if there is new musicians. <br />It must be consider as a beautiful achivement  equall to the first  four albums. This remastered Japanese new version is absolutely perfect and sounds much and much better then the first print.  A real pleasure to listened to it (again and again). But the great surprise is the artwork with is original color (metallic blue) not the blue that we have even on the original LP. Maybe the most beautiful cover of all the Santana's album. <br />If you like the first albums of Santana buy  this Japanese version of Borboletta and you will enjoy again the great work of this unique period.
6304696515|5.0|The period costumes for this movie were sumptuous--I wish I could wear some of the pretty dresses sported by Michelle Pfieffer and Glenn Close!<br /><br />Anyhoo, the acting is top-notch, from the soon-to-be-corrupted Uma Thurman's Cecile, the moral Michelle Pfieffer's Madame de Tourvel, the sans conscience Glenn Close's Marquise de Merteuil, to the role that would typecast John Malkovich for more than a few movies, his notorious Vicomte de Valmont. (You can see that Malkovich's Osmond in \\"A Portrait of a Lady\\" channels the pre-repentant Valmont.) The only slight off-casting was Keanu Reeve's role of music teacher/lover of Cecile and the Marquise. Keanu is great in The Matrix movies and in \\"Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure,\\" but I don't think this role was his best work.<br /><br />I have read almost half of the novel by Choderlos de Laclos and will one day complete it (I have a very bad habit of reading several books at the same time and of neglecting a book I had started to read for many months b/f I pick it up again).  There's one scene in the book that was also depicted in the movie that I particularly like.  In order to build \\"brownie points\\" with Madame de Tourvel, Valmont, knowing full well he was being followed by a servant of Madame de Tourvel, paid the debts of a peasant family who were about to be evicted.  In the book (this book is written in epistolary style, that is, the whole book consists of letters characters have written to each other), Valmont admitted to the Marquise that he felt genuine pleasure and was even moved to tears when he helped save this family from ruin.  He recognized that \\"do-gooders\\" receive a sense of pleasure from their charity, and that this pleasure has its own value---not of the same vein of the pleasure of self-gratification that Valmont usually sought.  This scene's brief glimpse of Valmont's \\"higher self\\" would later take root in his sincere love for Madame de Tourvel.  That a blackguard who's capable of abysmal cruelty can come to love the angelic Madame de Tourvel is sight for sore eyes.<br />Unfortunately, Valmont wasn't exactly clear about his own feelings until the Marquise spelled them out for him.  He had indeed loved the good Madame de Tourvel, and he was attracted to her goodness, a quality not often intact among his other lovers and acquaintances.<br /><br />Michelle Pfieffer really engaged the audience's sympathies when she broke down after Valmont told her he must end the relationship and that this break was \\"beyond his control.\\" All of her worst fears about Valmont and the warnings she had received against him seemed to be confirmed. However, Madame de Tourvel was informed before she died that Valmont had indeed loved her and that the time he spent with her was the happiest of his whole life.  This aspect of the movie/book is about as far as you can get from cynicism and transcends the other \\"nasty, decadent\\" relationships in \\"Dangerous Liasisons.\\"  Valmont's eleventh-hour repentance was beautiful, skillfully enacted by Malkovich b/f his death.<br /><br />The Marquise was devastated when she learned of Valmont's death.  She was booed at a concert after letters of her treachery were circulated (one of Valmont's dying wishes).<br /><br />On the special features, the actors gave some feedback about their characters. Glenn Close attributed the Marquise's cruelty in part due to the lack of options women had back then.  The Marquise was preoccupied with challenging and violating conventions while keeping up the appearance of them. John Malkovich was less sympathetic towards his character and just called Valmont's life a waste.

0140182829|5.0|Le Grand Meaulnes is a beautifully rendered tale full of love, loss, betrayal and friendship.  It is the tale of young boys at a boarding school who are coming of age and learning about all that life has to offer.  It takes place in the French countryside in the 1800's.  It is intriguing to watch the boys mature and take their initial steps into adulthood, from carefree days at their boarding school to emotionally intense times and lives that stretch far beyond the boundaries they had previously observed.<br /><br />That the author died in action on the Meuse at the age of 27 adds a purity to this story and an authenticity that dwells in the pages of his novel.  It is a joy to read.
0743201140|2.0|The first part of the book is all that business-fluff about talents vs skills vs knowledge. Then you take the online test. At the end, it tells you your 5 biggest strengths. Then, you go back to the book to read about them. For me, this is usually the best part of these types of books - tell me more about my \\"strategic\\" strength. Give me tips on how the best people use this strength. Give me statistics on how common/rare this is. Give me insights on how this might be shaping my personality or work style.  <br />In this book, there is a one-page writeup on each strength, with one paragraph explaining what the authors meant by that term, then three quotes from \\"real life people\\" that illustrate that strength. That's it. The rest of the book goes through FAQs and how-to-manage-this-strengths that frankly don't add much value. So yes, it's nice to have five more adjectives to describe yourself, but honestly there's not a whole lot of meat behind it, and my strengths weren't that surprising given other tests I've taken in the past.
B0002STNQ2|4.0|My husband bought this book and read it first, and he didn't like it a bit.  I still decided to give it a try, and was pleasantly surprised at how engaging it was.  Like a few others have mentioned, the biggest flaw of the book is that the main character doesn't figure out the clues sooner, especially considering how smart he is.  Even so, I still very much enjoyed the story, and I found the writing easy to understand.
B00003CX8N|3.0|Sigh.  There are a variety of different releases of 84 Charing Cross Road out there.  There's the US version (fullscreen in dolby), the UK version (widescreen in mono), and the Aussie version (widescreen in dolby).  But alas, if you only have a Region 1 player, you are stuck in fullscreen hell. <br /> <br />This is a remarkable movie.  It would be nice to be able to see the entire thing, and not just the center section.
B00008DDRX|5.0|I had seen this before purchasing, and knew the story line was weak, but the value in this one is the classy cars, and the awesome sounds of them racing...I'm a Porsche lover, esp. this era, so this one is a winner...a real keeper!
B00005JOSS|5.0|The enchanting idea of being in love in the past and present, the enchanting idea of being in love wholly and completely with someone you've never met, the enchanting idea of not touching but wanting, the enchanting idea of the existence of a soul mate for every soul.<br /><br />The Lake house at first received mixed reviews, I watched the movie curiously wondering if it was a total failure, the mood and pace may not be as fast as \\"Speed\\" nor as thrilling but the intensity of which two forlorn souls come to together in the most uncanny of situations is surprisingly superb.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves have always been accused of being wooden when it comes to acting, but I believe his woody approach to art is somewhat amazing to a certain degree that made lake house a believable movie of sentimental value. Sandra Bullock on one hand was considered at one point of time as Americas Sweetheart, which charmingly played to tune on this mature yet approaching flick.<br /><br />Alex moves into a house on the lake only to find a letter in the postbox, a letter filled with words that only he can begin to understand, words that would begin to make sense with every sentence as time moved on. Kate would move in a couple of years later and discover a distance so close to love that is almost inexistence.<br /><br />The Lake House was executed so well that I loved every minute of the movie, the art direction is space filling, and the shots are full of depth and strangely encapsulates the existence of the two main characters. If you were ever in love...this movie captures the spirit of being in love and every minute of bliss plus the sorrow.  I would watch it again just to believe.
B000F4PD7G|4.0|If a movie does not have computor generated graphics or big name stars, the chances of being picked up by Hollywood or distributed commercially is close to 0. Beowulf and Grendal is a good example. A movie with Atmosphere. Beautiful natural landscapes and photography. Well acted and with a message. All good reasons not to show. I had some difficulties with the editing and thats the only reason I deed not give it a 5. I suggest you wait and buy the DVD in September when it will be released for less than the wobbing $70.00 currently being asked.
B00005UDE7|5.0|Progressive rock in general tends to attract comments such as pretentious, bombastic and self-indulgent. This CD shows little reluctance to refrain from these appellations. The length of the music, the threading of the elements into a complex tapestry, the effusive explosion of ecstatic instrumental energy and alternating between obscure lyrics and descriptions with moments of diamond clarity come together to provide fodder for even the most benign of critical detractors. In summary, this CD is fantastic.<br /><br />The opening track to this two CD masterpiece, \\"The Glass Prison,\\" has some of the most phenomenal guitar work of any band I have ever heard. Every time I listen to how quickly the lead guitar is being play I am in awe that human fingers can move so fast. The style combines hard rock, progressive rock and a flavor of nu-metal to create an original, technical, and yet artistic song. There is much in this song to commend it to a much wider audience than is typical of any one of these individual genres. Progressive long at nearly 14 minutes, the group uses a variety of influences to create an evolutionary song that is simultaneously challenging and listenable. This song is the antithesis of shy.<br /><br />The second song, \\"Blind Faith,\\" is generally much mellower than the dynamic and explosive first song. The song begins slick and smooth with less heaviness than the first song, sounding almost pop. However, the build up to the chorus puts to flight the thought that this song is anything other than a vicious wolf in sheep's clothing. The charging guitars in the lengthy bridge cracker crunch into the notes leading to a lovely (yes, that is what I meant) piano piece before getting into a bass driven run-up to instruments enthusiastically alternating for the lead until the last vocal set is reached. This song is well-crafted with an excellent balance of art and technical skill.<br /><br />There is Moody Blues transition between \\"Blind Faith\\" and the \\"Misunderstood.\\" Unless you are watching the track changes you could easily miss the beginning of this track as there is no pause between tracks. \\"Misunderstood\\" is one my favorite tracks on this CD. The quiet, slow, introduction lulls you into a passivity that is instantly and violently blown away as the instruments and vocals shatter drivingly into your brain. I think I hear a mellotron in this song, which I always enjoy.<br /><br />\\"The Great Debate\\" takes on the challenge of human stem cell and other human cell research. The song begins with speakers stating portions of the opposing viewpoints, coming from opposite speakers. The complexity of the song matches the complexity of the subject, and the tone of the song is somber and sincere. The music and the lyrics provide ample opportunity to contemplate the content of the lyrics, which summarize the opposing viewpoints nicely (moral and ethical versus practical and beneficial), and suggest that we as a race are at a crossroads of sorts and we need to make a decision. The song suggests that we need to \\"turn to the light,\\" which I take to mean we need to face this issue rather than turn away, as our decision may define who we are.<br /><br />The heady moral complexity of the previous song contrasts with the simpler, and yet emotionally more powerful content of \\"Disappear.\\" Since this song deals with death and loss, some of the lyrics in the previous song are put into perspective, because you sense by the position of this song on the CD that failure of science may have led to the loss felt in this song. Every word sung is painfully wrought and pulled from a deep secret place where you may have thought they were secure. The song has hopeful elements, but the dark nature of the music indicates that the singer is still grieving over the loss of she who gave him hope. This song is one of those that you should listen to only when you are not already feeling morose.<br /><br />Thus far I have only discussed the first disc of this CD.The second disc deserves its own, completely separate review because it bears no relationship whatsoever to the first disc. In the classic tradition of progressive rock, the second disc is a concept with an introductory instrumental overture that combines some classical elements with hard rock, and an exit finale that sums it all up. In between is an exploration of the human mind, and what can appear to be insanity, or sanity, as there is no single definition for sanity. The music ranges from contemplative to crispy, from idle slow to light speed fast, from quiet to blast-off. This disc contains a concept album to rival some of the best progressive rock music concepts.<br /><br />When I listen to this two-disc set I hear influences from an array of groups, and I hear something completely new. When I was introduced to this music by another reviewer (now going under the name Samhot), it was so different from anything I had previously heard that it has taken me more than a year to come to grips with the music. This music is faster paced and more complex than early progressive rock. This music brings in modern rock elements, along with music from several other groups, to revitalize progressive rock, which had become somewhat moribund in the 80s and early 90s. The modernization of progressive rock is welcome to an old-timer like me, who has followed progressive rock from its roots in \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" to the seminal \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and its explosion into a separate genre populated by King Crimson, Yes, Genesis and a few select others. This new generation of artists is giving a new generation of listeners and an old generation of listeners a reason to return to progressive rock.<br /><br />Note that this CD is an import from Japan.  The U.S. release is readily available and costs much less.  Choose the version that meets your needs.t disc of this CD.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers follows the men of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne during World War Two. The series has ten episodes about 50 minutes to an hour long, and shows just how courageous people can be when they fight for what they believe in. This 7 disk set comes with a lot of graphic violence but is very accurate in portraying the lifestyles these men had to endure for many months, as well as the friendships they made in dangerous times. <br /> <br />Episodes Include: <br /> <br />1] Currahee - This takes place a year before D-Day and the men of Easy Company have arrived at boot camp. They must learn how to shoot a rifle, throw a grenade, learn sign language for stealth, and get into amazing physical shape from training as well as by running up a steep hill called Currahee. Led by their drill instructor Lt. Sobel [played by David Schwimmer] Easy Company starts to become the best at everything. The show ends after training as the men are called up to parachute into German occupied territory one day before D-Day to secure the area for the massive invasion. <br /> <br />2] Day of Days- It's D-Day and Easy Company has parachuted into Normandy. Lt. Winters drops and finds he's lost his men, doesn't have a rifle, and after meeting with other men from different companies, realizes everyone has missed their dropzones. After meeting up at the area everyone is supposed to go to, Winters is given the mission to take out a German artillery position. A fierce firefight that is still studied today by soldiers in training happens as Winters and his men attack the German position. The first death of a man has Winters wondering if he will make it as well in the war. <br /> <br />3] Carentan - The next job for Easy Company is to take control of a German occupied French town named Carentan. Although the mission goes surprisingly well, Winters is unsure it's over just yet. He's right, as a massive German counterattack force arrives to retake Carentan. Whathappens next is a stalemate between the two sides and another fierce firefight in the morning. However Easy Company prevails again with the help of a couple of tanks. The men take some well deserved R&R but are then told they are going back to Normandy <br /> <br />4] Replacements -  A new group of trainees, fresh out of bootcamp and never fired a rifle at a real person, arrive to replace those lost in the war so far. The next mission for Easy Company is called Operation Market Garden. Easy Company is ordered to take Eindhoven, a town in Holland. However the mission turns into a total failure as a massive German force turns the Allied forces back. Easy suffers many casualties and one man, Sgt. \\"Bull\\" Randleman, is stuck behind enemy lines.  <br /> <br />5] Crossroads - Winters is now a Captain after a fantastic victory against a German SS position which leaves two whole companies of SS dead. Winters prepares a report on the attack he led and the battle is shown through his eyes as he writes his report. Near the end of the episode Easy Company is told they need to go to the front line in the forested area near Bastogne. <br /> <br />6] Bastogne - The 101st Airborne is surrounded by German forces and are holding the line during the Battle of the Bulge. 2 medics are the only source of relief for injured men and the story follows one of them, Eugene, as he struggles to deal with many men injured and sick. The famous response to a German demand for surrender is shown here, as the Comanding General of the Airborne responds, \\"Nuts.\\" This is one of my favorite epsiodes just for the relationship between the medic, Eugene, and a nurse in the small town that holds the injured soldiers. <br /> <br />7] The Breaking Point - In this episode Easy Company must take the town of Foy, in Belgium. However the incompetence of the company's leader, Lt. Dike, has many of the men wondering if the company is going  to suffer a lot of unnecessary casualties following him. Easy Company also suffers a month of constant shelling while sleeping in foxholes in the woods before the attack, and this epsiode shows just how demoralizing war could be. Easy Company takes the town, but not without heavy casualties. An emotional episode. <br /> <br />8] The Last Patrol - Easy Company is on the front line in the town of Haguenau. A new mission is sent to Easy Company to cross the river that separates a German observation position from the Allied forces to capture German soldiers. Joining the patrol is Lt. Jones, a replacement fresh out of West Point who is eager to see some real action. This is another episode that shows the toll the war is taking on the men as the platoon the men are chosen from for this mission have already dwindled down in numbers from losses in Bastogne. Although the mission is a success, the death of a soldier has Winters wondering if orders for another patrol to be sent out the next day is a good idea. <br /> <br />9] Why We Fight - More than 300,000 German troops have surrendered, and Easy Company finally drops into Germany. Rumors that the Germans are finished have reached the ears of the soldiers and they begin to predict when the war will end. However all that talk is pushed aside as a patrol discovers the Nazis' most disturbing secret, a concentration camp. This is another greatly emotional episode as the men are shocked at what brutality the camps show. Also, word of Hitler's suicide comes to Easy, and they are now sure victory in Europe is coming. The beginning and end for this episode are fantastic. <br /> <br />10] Points - Germany has surrendered, and the men are wondering if they are going home. However in order to go home they need to have a certain number of, \\"Points\\" to show they've served their part in the war. They are also well aware that the war with Japan in the Pacific is still going on, and are wondering if they will be sent there next. This is the final episode of Band of Brothers, and it shows what the men are doing nowthat they are at peace with the Germans. At the end of the episode they show every single man who served in Easy Company and what they did after the war. A fantastic ending to a fantastic mini-series. <br /> <br />Extras on Disk Seven: <br /> <br />We Stand Alone, Together - A great documentary that shows the real men of Easy Company and what their lives were like during the war. A really great and emotional set of interviews. <br /> <br />Ron Livingston's Video Diaries - Ron Livingston, the man who played Lt. Nixon, shows a set of clips he himself filmed during the, \\"Actor Boot Camp,\\" as the actors prepared to play the real men of Easy Company. <br /> <br />The Making of Band of Brothers - A great look at the making of the mini-series. Showing the costumes, sets, and special effects.  <br /> <br /> <br />This is a great World War 2 experience. If you like watching World War 2 movies, this is one set that you should definately look at. Highly recommended.
B00008PX8P|1.0|when I open the cd it was missing a disc so I had to send it back & paid with my own money without getting a refund.
B0002W18MU|5.0|This latest album from the Man in Black is remarkable. For a man so worn out as he clearly was to create something so powerful is amazing and a testament to his undeniable skill as an artist. To dismiss these recordings as boring or irrelevant is criminal. They are melencholy messages of the end we will all eventually face and demand careful listening. Truly this is an CD that everyone should hear!
B0002DRDBE|4.0|This is a question that I sometimes ask myself when I'm whatching a Kevin Smith film. Kevin Smith as a writer and filmmaker is kind of hard to describe, but here goes; I think the dialog in his films are intelligent, not quite brilliant. I think his films are far from bad, but far from great. I think he's a lot like Spike Lee in that regard, but even Lee has been able to muster up two great films(\\"Do The Right Thing\\",\\"Malcom X\\") in a long line of hit and misses. In my opinion, Smith has yet to make one \\"great\\" film(and yes that includes \\"Chasing Amy\\").         I thought this movie was a great START for Kevin. The movie is about, obviously, a day in the life, a day at the job, of two friends who work as clerks named Dante and Randle. Dante is an insecure, nice guy, who works in the convenience store, isn't really doing much with his life, and can't really get over a girl named Catlin, who broke up with him when he was still a senior in High School, despite the fact that she cheated on him basically every chance she could. Randle on the other hand, is a rude, lazy, always showing up late for work, unapoligetic smart a** who works in the video store right next to Dante. This is also the debut of two of my favarite movie characters, Jay and Silent Bob. Of  course Jason Mewes( Whose  playing himself basically) provides that silly, immature, homaphobic humer that we all love and relate to. silent Bob played his typical silent comedic role with that oh so important and impactful thing to say during that one point in every movie that Smith has written him in. I'm not going to explain any more of the plot because I don't want to accidentally spoil it for any one who hasn't seen it.          I'll admit it, I found myself relating a lot to the Dante Hicks's  character in this movie in terms of his temperment and personality. Overall, I thought this was a pretty good movie and like I said great start for Kevin Smith. As far as extras on the DvD, it's the usuall, deleted scenes,Trailers, blah, but they have an alternate ending, that when I first saw it, part of me thought that it probley would have ruin the film, thus a great decision to cut it out, and another part of me who thinks that had they not cut out the full original ending, it may have gone down as one of the more bizzare, different, and , dare I say, brillient endings, that a movie of that type of Genre has ever had.
B000FGGE5Y|2.0|I recommend Ultraviolet for a rental.  The sets are gorgeous and Milla Jovovich is easy on the eyes in her midriff-baring, tight leather outfits.  There are clever, original ideas for technology and weaponry.  The story is good and compelling for the first half.  Violet is a former nurse who contracted the \\"plague,\\" a disease of the blood that gives the victim vampire-like characteristics.  No blood-drinking in this film; what a relief!  Like the X-Men, \\"hemophages\\" are fighting active persecution by the government.<br /><br />Violet has become a lethal assassin.  When asked to retrieve a case and not to open it, her feminine curiousity gets the better of her.  She finds the \\"secret weapon\\" she retrieved is a young boy.  Refusing to let him become a pawn in the blood wars, she simultaneously fights to unravel the mystery of where he came from, and to save his life.<br /><br />The film starts to go downhill as Violet, and the movie, lose their credulity, as she wipes out entire armies just because she is \\"pissed off.\\"  As the villian says, \\"One woman against (insert number) of men?  Ridiculous.\\"  Yes, it is, and the viewer quickly loses interest.<br /><br />Nevertheless, a good try from Kurt Wimmer and worth seeing once.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|Just got through the \\"first playing\\".  I must have play \\"Nature Boy\\" 10 times in a row... \\"Hiding All Away\\"...  just grabs me, great contrast between Cave and the b'kgrnd singers (reminds me of Jim Morrison, but with a lot more to say)! <br /> <br />I give it 4 stars for this first pass.. might go up to 5, but sure won't go below.
B000063V8R|5.0|After two OK seasons, Star Trek: The Next Generation finally hits its stride in the third season. When people mention that this is one of the greatest TV shows ever made, the third season is what they're talking about. Each episode is crisply written, well-plotted, and multilayered. The show's powers have grown enough to take on more of the massive and difficult-to-film topics that the second season hit only intermittently. All around, the show has finally become completely consistent and satisfying. <br /> <br />Character-wise, season 3 continues the developments introduced in season 2. Riker remains the risk-taker, and Data's arc toward humanity is developed wonderfully, especially in The Offspring. First-season casualty Tasha Yar makes her first of several reappearances in Yesterday's Enterprise, generally considered one of the best TNG episodes (though considered overrated by myself). The tension between Worf's Klingon heritage and Starfleet commission is explored in greater detail, especially in Sins of the Father.   <br /> <br />Most every episode in this season is at least entertaining, and picking highlights is difficult. Who Watches The Watchers is a beautiful and suspenseful treatment of Trek's most difficult dilemma - accidental human interference in a developing culture. The Defector features a dangerous political game between the Federation and the longtime antagonist Romulans. The Hunted is an extremely action-heavy episode with a twist of meaning between the numerous fights and chases. The Offspring is an excellent companion piece to season 2's The Measure of a Man, with less intellectual depth but more emotional resonance. Captain's Holiday introduces a new facet to Picard's often-muted personality.  <br /> <br />About the season finale, The Best of Both Worlds, a great deal has been said. This was one of the first TV cliffhangers to go between two seasons, and certainly one of the most effective as well. It's a bold stroke, and the final line of theseason is guaranteed to stick in your head until the episode's resolution at the beginning of Season 4. All in all, this is the first essential season of this excellent sci-fi show. Highly recommended. Just be warned, if you're in for this one, you'll be in for Season 4 as well.
0143036556|4.0|In this book, Jared Diamond puts forth a theory that many societies have collapsed in the past due to environmental degredation, and that if we're not too careful in the future, the same fate awaits us.  Some have criticized this book as the rantings of a envirmentalist nut, but I have to strongly disagree.  In fact, Mr. Diamond takes a very moderate position on evironmentalism.  What I found particularly interesting is his claim that safeguarding the environment actually makes good business sense for companies in the long run, and that those companies that are realizing this are the ones that will benefit in the future.  On the other hand, companies which ignore the impact of their actions will find themselves in the same position as the collapsed societies mentioned in this book.  Those who deny the impact that humans have on the Earth are living in a dream world.  Environmental problems, if no actions are taken, will only increase, especially as people in developing countries aspire to the same living standards as can be found in developed countries. <br /> <br />The chapters which I found particularly interested were those on the Greenland Norse.  Their situation was particularly enlightening for one reason:  they could have avoided collapse.  Depsite the climate change which occured in their environment, they took no action to change their ways.  Diamond points out that instead of learning new technology from their Inuit neighbors, they clung stubbornly to their European habits and identity, which doomed them to destruction.  If applied to the modern world, we can see that stubbornly clinging to old ways of life which no longer suit our environment will lead to problems in the future and possible collapse. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend that all people read this and think seriously about what will happen in the near future.
0140288503|5.0|This is the true grit of war.  People should read this for a greater appreciation of what our milary goes through.  Their sacrifices are made to protect our freedoms. <br /> <br />In due course we will all die.  But when we die, let us resolve that we shall have died confident that those who follow us will live freely; and that they, living as free men and women, will be grateful that at the threatened night, the blood of our forefathers ran strong.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|Every once and a while, we come across a movie that just sticks with us in the back of our mind. Maybe because its greatness was too much for us to comprehend in one sitting. Or maybe because the lesson is much greater than what we as people are not used to in cinema. With a generation watered down by Hilary Duff films where somehow everything works out okay, even though it seems irrational and makes almost zero sense. Donnie Darko though, is an emotional slap to the face for all that think that is how the world works. This is a movie, that does not just have not one scene that tugs at the strings of your heart, the core of your soul or the center of your mind. Every scene does that and it's not everyday we come across that. from the serious scenes to the depressing yet humorous scene involing hungry, hungry hippos and well.....regret. To the discussion between Sean, Ronald and Donnie involving \\"Smurfs\\" which almost felt like a more blunt version of the famous Star Wars discussion in \\"Clerks\\"<br /><br />I must admit though, I judged this before I watched it. Which I kick myself now for. I judged it because it seemed to have a cult following of pudgy Hot Topic obsessed poser kids. Being a dedicated REAL metalhead, hot topic posers are the bane of exsistance in my eyes. So, I wrongfully wrote this off as a cliche joke of depressed stereotypes. I was wrong.<br /><br />Anyway, the story starts off with Donnie Darko, a young man in the 80's going through,  depression, moral issues, arson issues, wonder of what the world brings and well a huge demonic bunny named Frank which brings news of the end of the world. He is surrounded what seems to be a normal family, a normal sweet younger sister, an older sister with obvious attitude issues and parents who are simply \\"worried\\" a love interest with the new girl in town, bullies and friends that really don't seem to be doing much in life. Watching Donnie transform through this movie was amazing and shwos his range as an actor. The last 10 minutes is truly thought provoking cinema.<br /><br />I have cable, so that is how I stumbled upon this movie. So, I can't give youexact details on extras for the dvds. However, they h ave played it alot and i've watched it 6-8 times this month and I must say, you won't be dissapointed. I will leave you will a few memorable quotes.

What kind does your step dad have?<br /><br />Gretchen: He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.<br /><br />Donnie: Oh.<br /><br />Karen Pommeroy: [to Principle Cole] I don't think that you have a clue what it's like to communicate with these kids.

Sometimes I'm afraid of what you might tell me. Sometimes I'm afraid that you'll tell me that this is not a work of fiction. I can only hope that the answers will come to me in my sleep.

B000GTLQXU|4.0|I went and saw this in IMAX the night it came out and was very impressed. The CGI was amazing, one of my friends afterward actually asked me if the Poseidon was a real ship! My only dissapointment was the script was lame in some parts, but other then that, a great movie. And btw, for those of you that didn't bother going to see it in theaters, you missed out big time. Watching the sequence where the Poseidon gets struck and rolled by the rogue wave was the coolest scene i've seen in movies. Period.
B000F3AAUW|4.0|Okay like many people, I became obsessed with \\"Crazy\\" with it's excellent baseline and memorable lyrics. After a while I gave it a break and considered most of the cd a bit eclectic for typical radio stations. However, I enjoy the live performances and creativity. Even if this project is short lived, wasn't it worthwhile to hear C-Lo SANG and Danger Mouse create memorable mixes.... I love \\"The Last Time\\". <br />
B000002H6C|3.0|I'm going to buck convential wisdom, and say this is Metallica's best album. It's definitely the heaviest, and in my opinion the most interesting. True, you can't hear the bass at all in the mix. True, Cliff Burton isn't on this. However, despite being a good bassist, it's not like he made any of the old albums that special. Metallica have always been more accessible than other metal bands in the thrash genre, but that's because they've always had songs that are a bit more obvious, easily digestible, and friendly to the masses than say megadeth or slayer. This album is the one exception. The riffs are more interesting. Hetfield's yarling sounds less cheesey. The vibe is darker.     Just like other Metallica albums, the drumming really holds them back. Can you imagine how much better this would have sounded with a drummer like Slayer's Lombardo? Still the song writing goes a long way to make up for it this time around.     If you're in it for the music I'd get this album, and skip the rest of metallica's catalog.
0060899190|5.0|This book is a great conversation piece.  Some of the secrets are a little sad, but others are funny or uplifting.  There seems to be something for everyone in here.  Everyone who starts reading it gets sucked in.  An awesome coffee table book!
B00008DDSC|5.0|i think alot of people don't understand this movie. simply stated; two very lost, hurt and needy people find love and healing in an intensely intimate, deep, risky, symbiotic and no holds barred  relationship. {sounds like a good marriage to me}. the film is incredibly erotic and intelligent. see it. you will be moved. don't concentrate on questions of realism, just be swept up by the brilliant ideas and truths that are being explored by the writers and directors. good luck.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I still go back to this CD when I need inspiration. It was an excellent project with every song being of high quality. \\"ExFactor\\" is my favorite sing along!  Anyway, Ms. Hill is not racist. Most Africans aren't. It takes political and social power ot be racist. It takes dislike to be prejudiced. I think she is just concsious of white oppression that has affected many across the world. That is vastly different from being a racist.
0345363132|5.0|Reading 931 pages is no small feat for a reader, and keeping all of those pages interesting is likewise no small feat for an author. Here, Penman succeeds tremendously. Richly detailed, well paced, properly staffed with characters yet still easy to navigate, historically accurate... this book has all of the elements required to satisfy even a discerning reader like myself. I have learned a great deal about the War of the Roses, Edward IV's reign, and Richard III's ascent to the throne by reading this engaging novel, and was entertained in the process. It is worth the effort, and I will definitely be investing time into Penman's other novels.
1400032717|5.0|I love this book.<br /><br />Being in 11th grade now, I have never read a fiction book fully. Not for school, not for myself, not for anyone else. I never read one when most kids start to love fiction...I have just simply never read a fiction book. My 'record' was 23 pages. And that was it. And that is not a lie.<br /><br />I had to read a book for school. I usually never do...but I had to do something to make it 'look' like I was working in class. Plus, you had to bring a book for points. So, I asked someone to let me use their book for that one hour of the day...just so I can crack it open and look at the pages.<br /><br />Now, I do not have any learning disabilities or anything. But the reason I have never read a fiction book is because I cannot understand and keep track of what is going on. All of the minute descriptions and insignificant happenings and figurative speech slow me down, and then I stop. I would have to reread paragraphs to get a remote understanding. It just does not work well with me. I read nonfiction. Specifically, mathematics, science, and language books. I skipped two years of Spanish, progressing in Russian on my own quickly, and I passed the AP Calculus BC test before finishing pre-calculus. It is the fact that those books are to the point. And are very explicit in what they say.<br /><br />So, when I was in class, pretending to read, I actually did read a page. I read the page, then went to the next one, then before I knew it, I was four pages away from beating my 'record'.<br /><br />The book really got my attention. And it kept it. And I was not bored to death. There was no 'garbage' (I know it is not garbage,it just is to my comprehension; there are very talented writers, I just don't/can't understand it). No figurative stuff, no unnecessary stuff. It was absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />The books plot was amazing. How it progressed, how it changed, and what the results were. I almost want to read it three more times. Despite the lack of intense description, everything was imagined so perfectly. It, I think, allows the READER to see it how they do - without being too inaccurate.<br /><br />This book is MUCH more than a mystery novel. It is a mix of a lot of genres.<br /><br />I cannot stress how well-written this is. And do not get me wrong; do not think this is like reading a text book. Read the 1000 some reviews to see. I guess you could consider it an 'easier read', but definitely worth it. It was just phenomenal.<br /><br />This is the kind of book where you wish it kept on going, and you feel terrible when you approach the '10 pages left' mark.<br /><br />This book does not have any 'fillers'. All of the writing is meaningful. Up to the very, very last sentence. So, I will say that if you open it up to read some random thing - something will get spoiled. And the book does have some great themes and morals embedded in it.<br /><br />All in all, I would rate this book a 10/5. And I recommend it to everyone, particularly those who are either (a) open-minded (specifically about uncommon social behaviour), (b) those who are educated in autism, and/or (c) those who want to understand what it is like from the character's point-of-view. I also recommend that you are at least done with (U.S.) grade 9 - just so you can fully appreciate the meanings, themes, and morals of the book.<br /><br />P.S. Oh, and, I DID finished the book completely. Every word of every page - which sets my fiction book count from zero to one. ^_^o perfectly.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|Absolutley enchanting voice. Well crafted lyrics and music.  It's sometimes difficult to compare music of other artists, but I respectfully would say it's almost like a cross between Sade & Norah Jones only a little more up beat,happier and sweeter. the music is an Aural massage.  Real music lovers will appreciate this artist.  It's too bad the radio station programmers won't put it into rotation.
B000002L9W|5.0|I had this album back in the day and loved it. It's been shelved for a long time and taken back out. I must say if you haven't heard this one in a while, CRANK it up!  <br /> <br />The Album kicks off hard with \\"Yankee Rose\\". DLR's vocals are perfect and his screams put chills down your spine. \\"Yankee Rose\\" was to be DLR's opening song to throw at Van Halen to say \\"I can do it without you\\" and he does. \\"Rose\\" is follwed up by another rocker \\"Shyboy\\". When you hear the intro though you'll be thinking this is from a Van Halen album. Steve Vai and Billy Sheehan really bring it on this song. Great track. \\"Goin' Crazy\\" is a bit pop but played loud it still rocks to me. \\"Tobacco Road\\" is a great cover. The entire album is great. DLR sounds happy and content, he has great musicians backing him up and he just \\"ROCKS\\"! If you haven't heard it, get it, and if you have forgotten it, CRANK it!
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Pulse proved Pink Floyd had a life after Roger Waters departed.  David Gilmour took the lead in two inspiring sets that cover new and old material.  Another Brick in the Wall was given more resonance given the patriarchal tone Gilmour had assumed.  Not sure where the children's chorus came from, as on these sets, Pink Floyd was backed by three svelte singers. I thought Shine on you Crazy Diamond was the best of the first set, beautifully explored and set the mood for the concert.  Learning to Fly was proof positive that Pink Floyd was as solid as ever.  The second set took in the Dark Side of the Moon, but somehow rang a little hollow without Waters. The images were what you had come to expect from Pink Floyd.  Pulse looks and sounds much better on DVD than it did on CD.

B00005LC1H|5.0|If I were to say to you 'i've discovered this farce set in a British hotel with wobbly sets , featuring a spanish waiter who says que ? all the time ..and a mad major , you might well say,  'You know I think I'll give it a miss..' Well you'd be making a very grave error because even 30 years after it was first aired, Fawlty Towers is still incredibly funny.It shouldn't be ....but it is. This is in no small part to John Cleese and Prunella Scales, the nightmare husband and wife team around which much of the farce resolves . The tragedy that is their marriage is the bedrock of much of the humor. Also the whole concept of a hotel run by a manager (Cleese ) who is amazingly rude to his guests, unless they are of the right class, is comic gold.

1594200823|1.0|Pollan's book lacks balance.  He uses two farmers in Iowa (who between them farm &lt;1000 acres) as exemplary of all corn farmers -- overfertilizing, using either new equipment they cannot afford or old equipment that damages their hearing, wearing out the soil, etc.  My midwestern farm-raised parents laughed out loud, countering with as many stories of well managed farms whose founding family owners are doing quite nicely, thank you, without raping the land. <br /> <br />In the section on pastoral farming, he uses the example of a farmer who will not ship product from Virginia to New York because of the inherent conflict of using fuel to ship 'truly organic' food such a long way, but who invites Pollan to drive down and pick some up - which would use proportionally more fuel than Fedex'ing the damn chicken. <br /> <br />The historical and scientific discussions are interesting, and (no pun intended) food for thought, but the lack of factual basis inferred by Pollan's generalizations makes the veracity of these discussions difficult to accept. <br />
B00003CXA2|5.0|I've written over two hundred reviews, I never wrote one for this film. I thought I wouldn't do it justice. I gave it my fourth watch and well, to say I'm gutted would be an understatement. Have I ever loved a movie character as much as that of Forrest Gump? No.<br /><br />Silence has been used well, the silence in the eyes of Forrest Gump. There's something rather powerful about his expressionless face. It can emote comedy, unconventional charisma but above all, a deep sense of sadness. I know this a rather bold statement that would raise a lot of argument but just for the sake of Forrest Gump and my love for this film, I can safely be abrasive and say Tom Hanks gave the best performance for a male ever in a lead role.<br /><br />I do not know whether I should commend the direction, or the screenplay, or the background music and screenplay because all I remember of when I think of this film, is Tom Hanks and that look on his face.<br /><br />Forrest Gump is special. In a wierd way,I would like to think every movie watcher relates to this story. It also manages to nail all emotions. When I watched this film for the first time, I thought about it for a week. With every new person, I meet in my daily life, or date, there always is a conversation about forrest gump. And I like mentioning to them how I lock my doors while watching this film because I wouldnt want anybody rushing to see me.<br /><br />The awkwardness in his actions, is similar to that of the character Edward (played by Depp) in a film called Edward Scissorhands. The humor is compareable to the great Stan Laurel. The way he cries,speaks,runs,gestures a hello, gestures a goodbye is HIS own. People of my age often talk about characters in films like Godfather(Pacino,Brando), Fight Club (pitt), XXX (Diesel), Rocky (Stallone) ,etc. They forget the quiet man with an odd face and the kindest of the simplest of expressions in Forrest Gump. I'm not sorry if you disagree with me, but the character of Forrest Gump owns all.<br /><br />My favourite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny \\"Cause you're my girl\\" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says \\"I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now\\", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running.<br /><br />I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too. This, and American Beauty are the two best films I have ever seen. I pray I watch a film I like almost 60% as much.Gump owns all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My favourite scenes from this film - Forrest says to Jenny \\"Cause you're my girl\\" , Forrest turns around to people running behind him and says \\"I'm pretty tired, I think I'll go home now\\", Forrest playing ping pong, Lieutenant Dan v/s God (storm), Bubba talking about shrimps, Forrest asking little Forrest what he's watching and sitting beside him, all scenes involving him running. <br /> <br />I criticisize the Americans a lot but this is one of the most American films I have seen and it stands as the most perfect,too.

I will warn you that reading just one topic may be difficult. If you enjoy science, physics, how things work, brilliant minds, you will love this book.

B000002LCX|4.0|Let me first state that I am a Smiths fan in every sense of the word. I wore my Queen Is Dead shirt to school picture day, for God's sake! But this is my honestly analytical opinion on \\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\".  The person who got me into The Smiths was my dad, British junkie that he is, and when he found this CD buried in a little indie record store, he was overjoyed and mystified, saying that he'd completely forgotten about this album (hmmm, now what does that tell us). So, I copied it and commenced listening.    1. A Rush And A Push And The Land Is Ours  Probably the best song on the album, actually. With a mock-ghostly, dramatic beginning, blossoming into a catchy and (I wince to use this word, but I must) bouncy vocal preformance. 5/5 stars    2. I Started Something I Couldn't Finish  This song is either about homosexual rape or something beyond the realms of my understanding. And what's with the  gutteral growling Morrissey's been toying with? This song actually has a really good beat. 3/5     3. Death of a Disco Dancer  This is an example of what came out of Morrissey's mind late one night after downing just a few too many. A strangely artificial beginning, dry lyrics, not my favorite song on the album. 3/5     4. Girlfriend In A Coma  This one I like, despite the very un-Smiths-like sound to it. Morrissey's characteristically grim humor abounds, if looking through another person's eyes (do you really think he has a GIRLfriend?). 4/5     5. Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before  A good title, if nothing else! But also a good vocal, good lyrics (when are they not?). But Moz, who is the \\"shy, bald Buddhist\\"? 4/5    6. Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me  This song made me cry the first time I heard it, but through my tears I couldn't help but wonder who the people were, screaming in apparent agony in the backround. Oh, but I love this song. \\"Last night I felt real arms around me. No hope, no harm, just another false alarm.\\" How true. 5/57. Unhappy Birthday  Hilarious like a sledgehammer on your head! With a mock-cocky rhythm, and cheerfully hateful lyrics, I can't help liking this. 4/5    8. Paint A Vulgar Picture  A pretty good idea lyrically, but they carry it on a bit too long. A strong dosage of reality, but not done particularly well, I must say. Except for the \\"dance my legs down to the knees\\" bit. 3/5    9. Death At One's Elbow  Oh, Morrissey and Marr, WHY? It's upbeat to the point of painful, the lyrics make little sense, and dear God was that a tambourine??? Goodbye my love indeed. 1/5    10. I Won't Share You  In my father's words, \\"beautiful\\". Well, he was never much for analyzing, but indeed it is. An acoustic is always a good way to end an album. Written for Marr, possibly? 5/5    There you are. Rate me, hate me, bless me, help me (wait, who am I talking to) keep scrolling down your computer screen, I don't care. My overall take on Strangeways, Here We Come is 4/5 stars. Cheers.

It certainly is very easy to read (actually, like all of Coelho's books). And after reading it, it might make you some action!<br /><br />Now, how many fiction books do that?

0156421178|5.0|Most books on the Spanish Civil War are either huge weightily 700 page plus tomes or tiny, abridged paperback books that can fit in your pocket.  But they've never helped me understand the events of the war.  Why?  Because the big books are done by authors trying to explain EVERYTHING.  How the tactics were effected by the industry which was effected by the politics which was effected by the war and so on.  An ocean of information that a reader can drown in.<br /><br />Or the books are slim summaries, like time lines with all the details snipped away.  The chain of cause and effect becomes a pile of broken rings, seeming to have no connection with each other, jumping in leaps and bounds, and the history becomes chaos.<br /><br />But Orwell's account is just the right size, showing us a sliver of the whole history through the eyes of one man, but a man who happens to be in the right place at the right time.  He is there to see the height of the revolution in Barcelona and is also there when that worker's paradise is sabotaged.  He is able to explain the reason for all the infighting, describing the horrors of trench warfare and the confusion of Barcelona uprising in May 1937.  He is the first author to clearly explain to me HOW the CNT and the FAI fit together and WHY the Communists seemed to change their position every week.  He makes sense!<br /><br />And the sad part it was published before the end of the war, so while pointing out many of the problems on the Republic's side, there was still a shadow of hope.  Of course the Fascists won the war.<br /><br />While reading the book you can see his own views change, you can see him go from an armchair socialist who hung around with the poor for a year to a hard, experienced man who learned to trust nobody and believe in nothing he could not touch.  The rats, the bad food, the piles of waste, the human suffering, the daily lies, the unclean pannikins, the partisan posters, the lack of tabacco and the ruthless police.  Here we find the seeds of Animal Farm and 1984.ds of Animal Farm and 1984. <br />
0060899190|5.0|I've been (literally) addicted to PostSecret for quite awhile and Iknow this book from cover to cover. The simple yet compelling concept behind the website and book are amazing. With each secret read, one feels that much closer to the world. I enjoy the book and site so much that I used a portion of the Amazon box it came in as a postcard and sent it to PostSecret as a sort of thanks to Frank for everything he's done for all of us.  <br /> <br /> This book is amazing. Every time I show mine to someone I have to beg to have it back. Quite honestly, it's some of the best money I've ever spent.
B000001ES9|5.0|I mainly bought this album for the song \\"Working man\\". It took me a long time to hear that song because all the other tracks on this incredible debut album are awesome and I kept playing them over and over. I liked Rush when I was in high school back in the early 80's but I was not a big fan. I first bought this cd back in the mid 90's and was impressed by the raw sound of this album. It has a very different sound than their latter stuff. It's not so refined which makes it very good listening. This album really rocks. Alex is awesome on guitar and Geddy's vocals kind of remind me of early Glen Hughes (Trapeze) and John Rutsy is pretty good on the drums. This is one of my all time favorite CD's.  <br /> <br />1. \\"Finding My Way\\" A great introduction song with a cool fade in. <br />2. \\"Need Some Love\\" A good tight solid rocking song.  <br />3. \\"Take A Friend\\" A good drum fade in and great guitar intro. <br />4. \\"Here Again\\" My all time favorite. A good bluesy tune that really rocks. Great vocals, Great guitar, Great Bass, Great drums. This song is absolutely awesome. <br />5. \\"What Your Doing\\" Cool catchy tune. <br />6. \\"In The Mood\\" Cool bluesy classic rock song. <br />7. \\"Before And After\\" Slow and Mellow for the first two minutes and then it kicks in and rocks. <br />8. \\"Working Man\\" This albums big hit. It rocks. <br /> <br />All the songs on this album have very good guitar works on them. If you are into guitar's like me you will love this classic album.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Most movies fit neatly into one of the categorical drawers in your DVD rack. Each is either a drama, romance, teen, action, mystery, western or some other episode in film genre. \\"Donnie Darko\\" is simultaneously none of these and a half-dozen of them.<br /><br />Similar to but better than \\"Final Destination\\", \\"Donnie Darko\\" is the story of a psychotic high school kid that hallucinates what appears to be a malevolent rabbit that orders bad things to happen. Sometimes Donnie participates in these events and they always affect him.<br /><br />The plot moves eerily in many directions from this premise, at various times approaching science fiction, horror, family drama, teen angst, comedy, adventure and school hijinks. Not all these types are equally well done and the film occasionally loses focus and direction.<br /><br />An all-star cast -- Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, Drew Barrymore as a misunderstood teacher, Noah Wyle, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Jena Malone, Patrick Swayze and Mary McDonnell as Donnie's mom -- lends consistent credibility to this movie, which sometimes goes quite far afield to make its point.<br /><br />The movie is full of surprises you don't expect. The ending is  a cult classic and watch how moralist-weight loss-lifestyle expert Patrick Swayze -- who is cast wayyyy against type -- gets undressed later in the movie by an act of violence that offers an ironically satisfying twist.<br /><br />Make no mistake, \\"Donnie Darko\\" is not a great film and will never make to the AFI 100. It is ultra-original and nearly impossible to categorize, however, and therein lies its interest.<br /><br />I'm sure this was marketed to teens when it arrived in 2001 but its appeal is far broader; anyone bored with formulaic moviemaking should take in \\"Donnie Darko\\" to see how near the end of the box film can still move in the era of copycat prequel sequels.
B000006TRV|5.0|The Wall takes music and brings it to the next level. Roger waters was able to express his feelings of depression through this story about a fictional character named pink. Lsitening to the album from begginning to end is essential!! All the songs on the album are wonderful, and contain wonderful guitar work from David Gilmour. some of my favorites include: The Thin Ice, Another brick in the wall Part 1,2,and 3, Mother, one of my turns, dont leave me now, hey you, is there anybody out there?, comfortably numb, run like hell. If you enjoy classic rock music, amazing guitar work, then i stronly urge you too buy Pink Floyd's The Wall.

B000021Y7X|5.0|In what must be one of the great full-length feature films of a live concert experience, Stop Making Sense is a marvelous melding of art direction, choreography, costumes, stage lighting, filmmaking prowess...oh, and yes, the wonderfully rhythmic sounds of Talking Heads.  All come together in a non-stop festival of sight and sound.    Watching frontman David Byrne on stage can wear one out!  When he's not simultaneously inciting every joint in his angular body to the infectious rhythms, he's running three laps around the circumference of the giant stage, or playing whoopsy-daisy with an oversized floor lamp, or writhing trancelike in \\"the big suit\\" while repeatedly bopping his head as if by a healing televangelist.  The movements, the music, the placement of the extended group of about nine musicians and singers, the colorful backdrops, even the camera positions -- all are a miraculous amalgam of planning and conscious conceit...and it all works!    Drawing the viewer into the film is a steadicam close-up following Byrne's tennis shoes as he walks out onto a bare stage with only a guitar and portable tape player to perform the opening number \\"Psycho Killer\\", which concludes with him doing a full-stage spastic twitch while strumming.  Then lovely blonde bassist Tina Weymouth (who looks for all the world like a hipper Mary Travers of Peter, Paul & Mary) joins Byrne onstage for the next number \\"Heaven\\", which includes an unseen female vocal singing harmony offstage while the stage crew rolls out large risers, atop one of which sits the drum kit.  Drummer Chris Frantz then bounds atop and across the risers into position for the next number, soon followed by the full contingent of other musicians.  It's quite the staging!    In all, there are fifteen energetic renditions of Talking Heads tunes (plus three bonus tracks of lesser visual quality), none of which were actual \\"hits\\" per se but a product of that creative burst in the late-'70s/early-'80s that came to be known as New Wave. Fans will not be disappointed! The group sans Byrne, known as The Tom-Tom Club, also perform a number.      While the seamlessness of the entire production, as I was to discover later from the added commentary, is due largely to blending shots and audio from three separate shows, it's probably a credit to director Jonathan Demme and the post-production crew that the editing, overdubbing, and processing are very transparent.  There are no interruptions, nor bombastic post-production visual effects.  It makes for a great viewing and listening experience!  There's also a choice of Dolby digital 5.1 audio schemes: one that puts you in the front row and the other at the mixing board, as well as plain stereo.    Special features include optional running commentary by the four original group members and director Demme, bios, discography, and a fascinating storyboard-to-film comparison with original notes by Byrne.  There's also a brief but odd \\"self-interview\\" by Byrne that's not to be missed!    It's difficult to recommend Stop Making Sense to non-fans, but perhaps those unfamiliar with Talking Heads will enjoy a virgin voyage with this non-stop ninety minutes of a truly singular performing sensibility.  I'm sure most fans already know what I'm \\"talking\\" about.  If not, what are you waiting for?
B00007G207|5.0|When I first saw Cinema Paradiso back in my college years, I thought that this was one great credit requirement.  The film, with its lighthearted yet sublime tone, first stirred my senses to the beauty of Italian cinema-- and you never forget your first time. <br /> <br />Well, after viewing the director's cut (an added 50 minutes of additional footage never seen before), what was thought of as perfect is now nothing short of excellence.  I don't want to give out the details of the film as I wouldn't want to spoil the experience for new entrants into the wonderful world of Cinema Paradiso, but the ending simply made it for me.  I don't really care how other reviewers responded to the ending, be it \\"deus ex machina\\" or \\"better edited than not,\\" but it came as a heartrending closure of an affair long past-- kind of like making amends with a fallen-out friend. <br /> <br />This DVD is an extremely satisfying movie experience that should be seen by avid filmgoers, enthusiasts, at least once in their lifetime.
0440241901|2.0|I find myself in the minority with these reviewers.  \\"Emma\\" in this book is the same character as the \\"Shopoholic\\" series main character (whose name I have forgotten already).   <br /> <br />After reading the Shopoholic series, I was hoping to find a bit of something different in this book and I was disappointed.   <br /> <br />The \\"Emma\\" character is flaky, shallow and insecure and for the most part so untrue to herself that I find myself (same as in reading the \\"shopoholic\\" series) hoping that something horrid will happen to her because she's so annoying and unrealistic.  And yet, the great successful rich man falls in love with her for being her quirky honest self.  I sincerely believe in being honest in relationships too, I agree with the theme that you should be yourself and not settle, that was the best part of this book.   <br /> <br />However, I'm left feeling like the rich successful man wouldn't have fallen in love with her if she wasn't a (in her words fat) size six(which is a US size four).  Please.  It's always a lot more believeable that the man really likes her for who she is if the main character isn't so \\"perfect\\" physically.   <br /> <br />Good things about this book and author:  Good escapism, can read book in a day, good English references.  This is why I keep buying the author's books, perhaps hoping one of them will be more realistic.  So far hasn't happened.  But we all love reading some fantasy/fluff once in a while, and for that I'm grateful for this book. <br />

I don't see any reason to re-release this for like the 50 billionth  time but since I don't have it, I will definitely buy the new 3 disc set.  I am hoping a group commentary will be a bit more exciting thean the one on the last criterion release.  Also the interviews sound amazing.  But why am I even reviewing this when it hasn't even come out yet?
B000005ILF|3.0|Sting followed up the superb TEN SUMMONER'S TALES with MERCURY FALLING, on which the former Police frontman experiments with blues, country, folk, and a little bit of gospel.  The album's biggest problem is a lack of energy.  Part of the charm of Sting's earlier releases was the power of his songs and the passion in his vocals.  Most of the songs on MERCURY FALLING are devoid of much energy, resulting in an unexciting, often pretentious album.  It does have its highlights, namely the bluesy \\"All Four Seasons\\" and the uptempo \\"Twenty Five To Midnight\\", the latter of which was inexplicably omitted from the US and Canadian releases of the album; also, the emotional \\"You Still Touch Me\\" and the gospel-influenced \\"Let Your Soul Be Your Pilot\\".  It's far from a bad album, but in the end it feels like Sting doesn't have his heart in it, resulting in an enjoyable, but unextraodinary recording.
B000FBGBPC|2.0|After waiting a few years to hear their follow up album, i was disappointed to find that the driving anthems that made their first album so good were gone.  Animal I have become is the closest song to their old album.....other songs like over and over are good but lack the intensity of home, just like u and other songs.  If you like the new sound try breaking benjamins, their melodies are much better.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|I can think of few records that would fit most any situation as well as this one would.  About the only thing I can't imagine this album being good for is to get one's blood pumping before an athletic competition . . . otherwise, Davis & this incredible cast of musicians made one of the most enduring & soul-caressing pieces of music imaginable.  The only jazz artists who made anything to rival this for vision and harmonic genius in the '60s are named Mingus and Coltrane.<br /><br />I shouldn't have to belabor what these songs sound like and why they are great.  I think it should be enough to say that this is Miles's best record of the '60s (and therefore pretty much his best ever, with the only possible competition coming from _Kind of Blue_ and _On the Corner_).  It settles on slow, soothing grooves and throws almost surreal harmonic and rhythmic softballs where one might least expect it . . . and, like I said, takes the listener exactly where she needs to be.  To unadulterated sonic bliss.
B000E97HIA|5.0|Remember how it felt to fall in love with a song and just listen over and over?  Grab this one and slip inside: Prince just gets it right.  Joyful and exuberant, 3121 blends beautiful love ballads, morality tales, and some sizzling dance tracks to acheive excellent results.  Less political than some of his previous albums, this one seems more personal.  He shares his beliefs with persuasive charm; I don't know anyone who doesn't want to feel \\"Beautiful, Loved and Blessed.\\"  Warning, \\"Get on the Boat,\\" is addictive: but that's why the \\"repeat\\" function exists.
B000C65Z1G|2.0|This movie was beautifully filmed and well acted, a good thriller and a treat for Fiennes fans.  BUT what a ridiculous plot.  Are people so overwhelmed by the relentlessly negative media coverage of pharmaceutical prices that it has become plausible that a pharmaceutical company functions like a cross between the KGB and the Mafia?  Even as I was touched by the romance of it, I choked on the silly plot developments.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Wands at the ready! Daniel Radcliffe takes up the role of mysterious boy wizard Harry Potter from J.K. Rowling's epic seven part fantasy series. Fans of all ages have been going crazy ever since they heard that Rowling's popular series was going to be transfigured, so to speak, into a film to be showed on movie screens around the world. Yet what makes this movie so unique is that it was not derived from a modern video game or television series, that the younger generation seems to enjoy, but from an ancient form of entertainment. A book! Just what is the magic that is held within those pages, that seemed to have hooked readers into its compelling storyline around the world?  <br /> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is filled with plenty of excitement. The screenplay is wonderfully interpreted from Rowling's complex storyline that introduces the Harry Potter realm; actors and actresses portray believable, memorable characters, and every scene is filled spectacular special effects. I find it only fair that this movie is truly a piece of magic itself.  <br /> Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the first in a compelling seven-story adventure where one night living with his aunt and uncle in a somewhat abused life, eleven-year-old Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that he is a wizard and gets shipped off to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to learn the art of magic. At his arrival he befriends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and the insufferable know it all Hermione Granger (Emma Watson), and of course there's the deadly enemy the main character always makes, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton).  <br />Harry Potter is brought about many trials and cloisters in learning the art of magic with his many teachers like Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and \\"greasy git\\" Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), all while being praised highly by the greatest wizard in the world, Albus Dumbledore (Richard Harris) and taken under the large wing of the half-giant gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane). What makes this story more compelling is that Harry Potter himself is a hero, a hero for defeating a dark wizard by the name of Lord Voldemort (craftily done by computer generation). Now Lord Voldemort is after a precious stone that will make him immortal, and Harry and his friends are the only ones who can stop him.  <br /> Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone, is filled with action packed scenes that have been digitally enhanced with the wonders of technology from a three-headed dog to a miniature dragon. Some of the best scenes include the Quidditch scene where Harry partakes in his first Quidditch match, the devil's snare scene where Harry, Ron and Hermione find themselves being choked by a plant, and finally the troll scene where Harry and Ron save Hermione from a ghastly looking, mold covered troll. These digital enhancements polish the gems of the movie perfectly and make them shine with outstanding brightness, for they really give the movie that magical aspect.  <br /> The setting is also another strong point found within the movie. Most of the places match the ones described in the book perfectly. They create such a vivid image in the mind, that it almost makes you think that it what you are seeing is real. The Hogwarts castle is depicted almost perfectly with it's towering roofs and warmly lit windows. The corridors are lit with torches and floating candles while the potions classroom looks dark and grimy. The grounds are beautiful, flourishing with a spring of magic. Every aspect was craftily done to make the movie as real to the book as possible.  <br /> The movie also has some shortcomings as well. For it being two and a half hours long, you figure they'd put the important parts in. However, this is not the case. Most of the time, the important parts that lead to the next event were cut out and rearranged to make the story better for a movie audience.  In other aspects of the film, Harry is portrayed unrealistically as a boywizard who defeated a dark lord at the age of six months is now the greatest wizard of all time? From the moment Harry enters Hogwarts he becomes a hero even though he didn't do anything. For most of Harry's life he didn't even know of his great feat against the dark lord, and within days at Hogwarts he is flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew that one day he would become a hero.  He then takes on the responsibility of saving the entire school from dark powers without question. I'd expect that an eleven-year-old boy would be scared just like every other young kid who was threatened with death.   <br /> Harry Potter, for all the glory it received, does have some competition. I firmly believe that Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone fell directly between fans of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, both of which came out with their own movie. Firm Christians sought out Narnia, while hardcore fantasy fans fled to Lord of the Rings, leaving Harry Potter in the middle. However there are some hardcore Harry Potter fans as well, but when Rowling's epic story ends, will this brilliant story just fade or fall into the shadows of films that have become classics.  <br /> Even though the movie had both very strong points and it's shortcomings, it was still overall a great film. As the first of an epic seven part series, this movie ends with a happy ending, but a lot of questions unanswered. There can be both a good and bad side to this. Many fans can't stand the waiting for the next film to be produced in a year or so, but if you get them hooked enough, you can guarantee that they'll be back for the next one. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie made for family viewing. It depicts the life of a wizard and how he copes with being in a new world. It also firmly implies on the important lessons in courage and loyalty to those you care for.   <br /> As of now, there are total of six books and four Harry Potter movies, all ofwhich have hit record amounts. Fans of J.K. Rowling's masterpiece are anxiously awaiting the closure of her series with the final book. I suggest until that happens, fans can occupy themselves with watching the magic of the Harry Potter films and the majestic moral themes they present.  <br /> <br />This is a Reveiw by Katelynn Mallon <br />Rabbid Harry Potter fangirl
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I was flipping the channels and I so happened to see the \\"Crazy\\" video. My jaw dropped!!! The music, the lyrics and the spirit: COMBUSTION! I would dare to say that this artist is a POET AND A SPIRITUAL CONVEYOR. I immediately bought the cd, I got more than I bargained for. WOW, WOW, WOW!!!! TRUE POET WITH JAMMING AND AWE INSPIRING MUSIC. LATER, I PURCHASED HIS EARLIER WORKS \\"HIS PERFECT IMPERFECTIONS & THE SOUL MACHINE\\" WITH ARE ALSO PROFOUNDLY THE SAME AS THE LATTER. GOD BLESS YOU CEE-LO/GNARLS BARKLEY. MAY YOU CONTINUE TO CONVEY GOD AND SPIRIT THROUGH YOU AND YOUR BEAUTIFUL MUSIC. \\"WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.\\"
B0007OASII|5.0|I won't bother glossing over how wonderful this album is because as you have probably heard this really is up there in the Masterpiece section. I am not a die-hard Kamelot fan to let you know but i have followed them and their progression for quite a while, and am very familiar with them.  <br /> <br />The Black Halo continues the story of Ariel and has Mephisto appearing to. Anyway standout tracks are 'March of Mephisto', 'Soul Society', 'Abandoned', 'The Haunting (Somewhere in Time)' and the wonderful 'Memento Mori'. But all the other tracks are above average to say the least. Even the interludes are kinda fun lol.  <br />'March of Mephisto' features Dimmu Borgir vocalist Shagrath in the role of Mephisto and it works well with Khan's voice sounding evil in parts of the song. The military-styled drum roll at the beginning gives a sense of Mephisto and his army coming to take over. The drumming is actually pretty good and varied for this song if you listen close. 'Soul Society' is a lush song with plenty keyboard flourishes to soothe the listener, wonderful lyrics to! 'Abandoned' is a great ballad-ish song with a piano intro and Khan singing at his best, there's also a part of the song which i believe is a direct outtake of the song 'Helena's Theme' on Epica. 'The Haunting' is a really cool song IMO doesn't really have amazing lyrics but it's just an awesome riff (although i figured it out in about 10 seconds lol) and the female vocalist is also a nice addition to the song, it's a catchy one. On to the real strong point of this album 'Memento Mori', i do not know how to describe this song it's unbelievable! The tempo changes, tone changes and structuring are brilliant and unconventional to any other song i have heard. The lyrics are fantastic and Khan shines as Thomas Youngblood propels us through with his gentle and aggressive guitar. Shagrath shows up again on this song, he's one of my fav black metallers, his voice is very bearable not like some of those horribledeath vocalists on gothic albums.  <br /> <br />I usually put this album on when i sit out in my garden and read a book or magazine. It's so relaxing and unintrusive, almost like a classical symphony. But that's what this album is a sheer CLASSIC! Do yourself a favor and get this album before you regret it! Hope that was helpful. <br /> <br />\m/
B000EMGAOY|4.0|I love the red hot chili peppers! I havent listened to the second cd yet but the first one is good. If youre a fan, I would get it
B00008DDXC|5.0|this was a great movie. the 1st is still my favorite but this is still classic. Columbus sticks to the book extremely well, gets everything exactly how it should. If you will notice he did a WAY better job than the directors for the 3rd and 4th. His stuff was great. diagon ally, the costumes, the look, hogwarts, school, it was all great.
0553801503|2.0|I hate to trivialize my review so much - but I did not care a single iota about what I was reading. I found myself having to search old character lists for references to the obscure folks being featured in this episode, wondering why I was being subjected to the events occuring in this book and worst of all - I had no desire to even read the upcoming Dance w/ Dragons upon completion. I fondly remember staying up late with the lights on to read Game of Thrones and endlessly chatting about the end of Storm of Swords. It's almost as if this latest installment was a Story-Published-In-The-Same-Universe as GRR Martin's Song of Fire and Ice for as much enjoyment as I got out of it. This was a chore.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Well, it was enjoyable ill give you that. I just didnt like how they related it to the book alot. like we went from hard core stick to the book to street clothes, non bushy hair, etc. The dememntors wernt scary. Sirius black looked good, and I liked what they did to him. They missed out alot on crookshanks and black together, and black coming into the common room at night, and the story of the map, and how lupin was REALLY good friends with james, and all of that. They just got alot wrong, and that is bad. really bad. bt if you forget all that it was ok.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|FINALLY a cd with someone singing and you can actually understand what they're talking about!  The \\"Star Searching\\" of the music business has been its downfall, screeching and riffing your way through every single song is not singing, neither is shaking your booty so much that you have to lip synch your way through every live performance.  A real singer can put a mike in the middle of the stage, stand in the spotlight and people will pay attention, few people can do that, Luthor Vandross, Patty Labelle, Streisand and Sinatra to name a few were and are capable.  The ones that need the smoke and mirrors to distract from the fact that they can't are too many to mention (i.e. a certain OVEREXPOSED singer from a now defunct girl band).  <br /> <br />Good lyrics,  a pleasing voice and great delivery, perfect for those times when you just want to kick your feet up and relax.
B00003CXI1|5.0|this movie was awesome. columbus starts the move sirius brilliantly, it was just awesome. it stuck to the book so well. i think ive watched it a hundred times. its just so great
B000GYI32M|4.0|The OC season 3 is senior year for our favourite teens as they enter the end of an era. This season is probably the worst of all three seasons so far, but it does show that senior year isn't perfect. <br /> <br />In this season, Ryan and Marissa's relationship takes a turn after Marissa shot Ryan's brother Trey to protect Ryan from being killed. While Trey turns out fine, Ryan and Marissa must deal with the consequences of this towards their relationship. Marissa is soon expelled from school, leaving her to meet some new friends at her new school. Marissa isn't able to talk to Ryan about the Trey issue, but she is with a new friend Johnny. Soon, Marissa gets closer with Johnny and further away from Ryan. Things heaten up when Marissa's little sister Kaitlyn returns from boarding school all grown up and makes a play for Johnny. Marissa realizes that she does have feelings for Johnny, but she loves Ryan. This soon leads Johnny to die. His cousin Sadie returns for the funeral, but gets closer with Ryan. Ryan and Marissa break up now. Marissa then goes for support with a bad-boy Volchuk. THese relationships stay put for a while as Ryan and Marissa become friends again. But after Sadie leaves and Volchuk breaks Marissa's heart, they are single. But, as they seem to almost be getting together, tragedy occurs when Volchuk does the unthinkable to Marissa (see the DVD for this one). Seth and Summer remain happy and try to keep Ryan and Marissa happy too. But a perky teen named Taylor tries to take Marissa's place in school when she leaves, making Summer fight for Marissa. Taylor tries to steal everything from Summer including Seth, but they win as Taylor loses everything. They gradually become friends and deal with Summer's father's affair with Marissa's mom. But, things get worse when Seth gets nervous for college so smokes pot and lies to Summer about certain things. Their relationship gets more strained when Seth is not accepted to the same college as Summer so he lies toher and breaks up with her so she'll stay at the college (Brown). But, Seth realizes he has to stop his lying and the truth is all revealed. Their relationship then seems great, but most likely doomed after Marissa's tragedy. Kirsten returns home and works to get better, but Sandy gets worse as he becomes a 'workaholic'. This leads Kirsten eventually to relapse, but they finally make up after Sandy returns to his old job and now Sandy or Kirsten aren't making mistakes. Julie tries to get back with Jimmy, but he soon leaves as she learns she is broke. She then is sent to live in a trailer for a while until she is enchanted by Summer's father. She is soon engaged and they move into Summer's house. Their relationship seems great, but it most likely will be strained due to Marissa's tragedy. <br /> <br />Other stories take place too, but nothing is as big as the most devastating and shocking finale yet to lead the show in a new direction next season. But, I would recommend buying this DVD just to fill the collection and some episodes are spectacular.
B0000255CL|5.0|Immortal...top notch Black Metal. Consisting of mainly three members throughout their career, Immortal came forth during the height of their success with -At The Heart Of Winter-. This was the first to grab my attention towards actually listening to Immortal, mainly because of the majestic cover art. While only holding six tracks produced by the godly Peter Tagtgren, the album is more than enough to satisfy our diabolical tastes. One notably difference is the thrash influence, which works wonders with Immortal's formula.<br /><br />One amazement to me is the virtuosic Abbath Doom Occulta. Since Demonaz suffered a severe hand injury, he was hindered so much that he couldn't remain an member, but wouldn't let his skills go to waste. Instead, he decided to become the bands lyricist, and his works show up on here. This has left Abbath to reach out to all instruments except drums. Really quite the feat when you think about it how much effort it takes. Then again I'm pretty sure there were session musicians.<br /><br />Anyways, sides having the cover art in your possession, the tracks are truly divine. Notable nods would be given to inner four tracks: \\"Solarfall\\", \\"Tragedies Blow At Horizon\\", \\"Where Dark And Light Don't Differ\\", and \\"At The Heart Of Winter\\". The vocals are easy to come by, the riffs are a pleasure to listen to, the solos are thrilling, and while listening to all of that, your mind will drift into the heart of winter.<br /><br />If this review doesn't say anything important about this CD to you, then look at the 5 star average and all the previous reviews. Almost all of them agree that -At The Heart Of Winter- is everything it strived to become. There is no turning back. The only thing left to do is journey 'till winters end.
B00005JKCH|5.0|This is a well-done action flick of a movie, and I've always liked Tobey McGuire since I saw him in the movie ``Pleasantville''...also like Kirsten Dunst in this movie, but not so sure about Willem Dafoe as the bad guy or the character who played his son. I recommend people give this movie a try, and certainly they won't be disappointed at the prices it's selling for now.
B00004Y6NX|5.0|Making Movies is one of my favorite albums from Dire Straits. This terrific album has highlights like Tunnel of Love, and Expresso Love. I suggest you get this album with all the albums from Dire Straits til Alchemy.
B000FVQYZY|5.0|After coming back from a Muse concert, I have to state that this album is much more impressive LIVE. <br /> <br />As any good musicians they have grown and in their case, into a more socially conscious group. Bellamy's take on the world politics are not for those who follow politicians and leaders blindly. I think he realizes that he has some social responsibly with his status, and he's bringing it forth through his lyrics/album.  <br /> <br />Although, I have to agree that this album doesn't contain the explosive power of Absolution (Hysteria, T.I.R.O., Butterflies) I still think this album is very solid. Muse is getting better making a solid commercial album, yet experimenting enough not to be stale.  <br /> <br />Personally, I don't know why people are complaining so much about this album. You could hear some influences from the 70s, 80s and 90s. It's truly a good solid album.   <br /> <br />As for some of the tracks, I personally love \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\" it's different for the group and the guitar riff is catchy. \\"Take a Bow\\" makes me feel like I'm being transported to the 70s. \\"Starlight\\" seems like it belong in a teen movie. \\"Map of the Problematique\\" is a solid \\"Muse\\" track. \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" is very futuristic/ psychedelic and it's a fun song to sing with the band in concert.  <br /> <br />As for the special addition CD/DVD set, it's worth getting so you know how cool this band is in concert. Saying that they are a good live band is an understatement. It's worth the extra bucks to get the DVD. Frankly, I was happy to see it because even though I've seen them in concert many times, I never heard \\"Sing for Absolution\\" live. I was very glad to see that it made it on their DVD.   <br />
B000002H97|5.0|Metallica black album is one of my favorites from one of my favorite metal bands along with GNR. This is the best one which has terrific songs including WHEREVER I MAY ROAM, ENTER SANDMAN, and UNFORGIVEN. Master of Puppets is recommended too. Get both of them along with GNR GREATEST HITS today.
0440237688|4.0|This is indeed an amazingly written and well thought-out book.  No wonder it's so well reviewed and awarded.  It really makes you look at society and life in general today, and practically anyone can relate to the main character on some level. <br /> <br />  Personally, I wish that I had read this back in middle school and believe that more books along this order (like F. 451, 1984 and Brave New World) should be required reading for students.  Books like this are helpful in teaching younger people to question the way things are and, more importantly: why things are the way they are.  We are short on true thinkers these days, not conformists. <br /> <br />  As for my rating, the only thing that keeps this from getting 5 stars is the ending!  I guess I feel that there could have been a little more closure, as with what happens with the main character, but then again, that was probably the intent here; to encourage reflection.
B000002H33|4.0|I think my favorite track from all of Metallica is Orion. I'm not really a huge fan to them. I just like this and the black album.
B0001BKAEY|3.0|The biggest mistake the Wachowski brothers made with The Matrix Revolutions was assuming the audience had emotionally latched onto the characters after the first two films, when in fact they had not. True Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are interesting, but the heart of Matrix fandom lies with the intricate philosphical constructs the films created. Matrix Reloaded had philosphical elements, which kept audience interest despite the film's weak plot line. Revolutions, on the other hand, is a pure sci-fi action flick. It asks us to care about the supporting characters in Zion, when we really don't know them that well. As a result the film is a visual feast of impressive special effects, but it feels very empty in the middle.<br /><br />What also hurt is that Revolutions splits up the lead characters, with Morpheus given little to do than play co-pilot for the finale. Potentially interesting characters like Persephone and the Merovingian disappear early on in the first act. And Agent Smith becomes the end boss for the movie because movies like these need end bosses.<br /><br />There are two dvd editions available; this 2-disc set, and a huge Matrix collection that contains all the films and bucketloads of bonus material. The bonus material on this set is already pretty decent. If you're not a huge fan but still want to own the movies, this set will fit your collection well.<br /><br />Not exactly how the Matrix should've ended, but still a good popcorn flick when you're bored.
B000F3TBIO|4.0|After a long wait of hearing leaked demos and rumblings that this would never see the light of day, Peeping Tom is a refreshing album in a sea of underwhelming material, yet isn't quite what I hoped for. The album is solid, but I wanted something more. I used to get a certain feeling when listening to Patton, and this just didn't grab me as much as I wanted it to. Still one of the best of '06, though. <br />4-stars, could've been a 5 if it was a tad better.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|Whereas Pixar always focused on good, clean family fun in its pictures, Shrek came into the spotlight because Dreamworks decided to skew the jokes a little more towards the older audience, while maintaing the basic family-friendly atmosphere. It worked, and Shrek was the film that proved it didn't take Disney/Pixar to create animated box-office gold.<br /><br />This first movie in the series still holds up well. Some of the pop culture jokes are instantly dated (this was done when everyone had to do a Matrix spoof), but others like the jabs at Disney are still hilarious. It helps that at its heart, Shrek still has all the usual fairy tale elements, albeit twisted. Myers, Diaz, and Murphy turn in top performances. And some of the dialogue is quite memorable (\\"Ogres are like onions\\").<br /><br />The dvd has some decent extras, as well as a sampling of dvd rom games that are better than most extras of this sort. It's still not a really loaded set, but it's good for a family release and worth looking into.
0060254920|5.0|I first read this curious book when I was a child, and my daughter frequently demanded that I read and reread it to her, and I have just read it to my grandson for the first time--who demanded that we read it a second--then a third--then a fourth time--chatting about the artwork and laughing about the silly monsters.  <br /> <br />At four years old, before he went to sleep he mused if the story had been real or perhaps it was a dream.  \\"I hope I have a dream like that,\\" he said as I flipped off the lights. <br /> <br />It could have no higher recommendation <br /> <br />Michael
B00005JOML|1.0|Having just come from a screening, I must say, that was the worst movie I have seen in a long time. The attempt at gritty cinematography looked like it was filmed using a cell phone camera. The dialog was stunted and cliche to the point where people in the audience were laughing at how bad it was. The pacing made it feel much longer than it actually was and all the characters in the movie had an overly serious look about them the entire time. Judging by the audience's reaction, I'm not the only one who thought it was horrible. I had higher expectations given the cast.
0385513755|5.0|Esta edici&oacute;n es ideal para aquellos a los que nos gust&oacute; el libro y no conocemos los lugares que nombra. Figuran todas las iglesias, el Museo, las pinturas de Da Vinci, todo en fotos color hermosas, la edici&oacute;n es un lujo. El &uacute;nico problema es que es bastante pesado y grande, dif&iacute;cil de trasladar (sobre todo para gente que como yo suele leer en el colectivo!).
6305807930|4.0|In an age where garbage like the SAW movies and endless remakes of horror classics (The Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror, etc.) clutter up theaters, it's nice to be able to revisit the visionary horrors of Dario Argento.  Sure, Inferno is slow-paced by today's standards...and it's all the more terrifying for it.  Like a master painter, Argento takes time to compose each scene for maximum visual impact.  Each time I watch Inferno, I get drawn in again.<br /><br />Like his masterpiece, Suspiria, Inferno isn't terribly well-acted or even conventially plotted.  But again, it's about the visual experience, the in-your-face horror.  Do your nightmares make sense?  More often than not, they don't.  And that's what the best of Argento's films do: they approximate living nightmares.  Even the music--at times discordant and jarring--adds to the unsettling feeling that Something Is Not Right Here.<br /><br />It's safe to say if you're a fan of those recent movies I listed at the start of this review, you probably won't care much for Inferno.  But if you have a little patience and willingness to go along for the ride...you may just have a few nightmares after spending a couple of hours in the world of Dario Argento.
B000E8QVWY|5.0|He absolutely should have won the Academy Award for best actor.  This movie, made me fall in love with Johnny Cash.  Reese Witherspoon was also great in it as the beautiful and devoted June Carter Cash.  I don't believe I have ever seen any other love story so beautiful as this one.  I don't even know what to say exactly, except, I loved it.  Loved it! Loved it! Loved it!  You've GOT to get this one. :)
B00009L1UP|5.0|EMPIRE is Queensryche's best CD ever. Unlike OPERATION: MINDCRIME and OPERATION: LIVECRIME (the latter mostly a live performance of the former), which were depressing and grim, EMPIRE bespeaks a hope for change and a desire to do something about major issues both personal and social. The opener, \\"Best I Can\\", is about overcoming a disability, whereas the title track and \\"Resistance\\" are calls to arms to resolve the issues of crime and environmental destruction, respectively, and \\"Jet City Woman\\" and \\"Another Rainy Night (Without You)\\" are love songs as only Queensryche can do them. The band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 on drug-smuggling charges was unjustly convicted, as well as their advocacy of increased funding for community policing, makes EMPIRE an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|Why do I say that?  Well, if you read the cover of the dvd, one critic wrote that it is a very funny movie.  I don't even believe this movie was meant to be funny.  Okay, so this isn't exactly the type of movie that I would usually love, that's why only 3 stars. HOWEVER, the acting is superb.  I mean, Felicity Huffman totally deserved the Oscar nomination.  She was very believable in it.  For that reason alone, I would say yes to this movie. :)
B00005JLK1|1.0|I was absolutely dismayed to read that another reader actually reviewed this trashheap as \\"not a slasher flick, it's a ghost story,\\" and compared it to \\"The Changeling,\\" one of the best ghost stories ever made, despite it's dated appearance now.  <br /> <br />Let me 'splain a thing or two. If the first scene in the movie shows the dismembering of some eighty people, if that scene shows not only entrails, but blood measured in buckets, brains, chunks of bone, and other internal parts of the human body, all in a stewpot mixture on a dance floor... then the movie you're watching is a slasher flick.  <br /> <br />This movie had the greatest premise and the most miserable execution I have ever seen on a screen of silver. I fully agree with the other reviewer that commented about the characters: not a single one was likable, and I, too, and getting sick to death of the \\"Anything a man can do, I can do better\\" token female character. <br /> <br />\\"Ghost Ship\\" was marketed as a ghost story. All of the preview snippets that showed filmy people were of the little girl's ghost. The ticket-buyer was deluded into thinking that the story would perhaps be a murder mystery about that little girl's death. Something on the order of \\"The Lady in White\\" meets \\"Lost.\\" Instead we got to see severed limbs, demonic slayings, and pointless bloodshed. <br /> <br />This film is nothing like \\"The Changeling\\" which had three DROPS of blood in the entire film.  The film has ZERO resemblance to \\"The Others\\" which offers not a single dismemberment. <br /> <br />This is not a ghost story. It's a badly done slasher flick with a novel location. My military base actually offered this as a free film, which is the only reason I went. <br /> <br />I want my money back. <br /> <br />~D.
0060825219|1.0|It seems that most people who rated this book highly have not read the author's other works.  If this were the first book I ever read about spirituality and a personal quest to better oneself, then I might be so enchanted by the flavor of the book that that I would rate it highly as well. <br />Unfortunately, I have read seven other books by Paulo Coelho, and this one is easily the worst.  It is untolerably boring.  The weak plot fails to redeem itself, even at the very end when the main character (ostensibly a representation of Coelho himself, based on the endless babbling about how hard it it is to be a best-selling author) finds his wife.  I will refrain from writing more plot spoilers, though, because the plot was already sufficiently spoiled when Coelho put it on paper. <br />Do yourself a favor.  Read these three books by Coelho in this order: 1. The Pilgrimage, 2. The Fifth Mountain, and 3. The Alchemist.  There you will discover the inspirational spirit that made Coelho so beloved.  In The Zahir you will only find a waste of your reading time.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|I only recently became familiar with Buble when I heard him sing as a guest on a Chris Botti album. I saw this DVD/CD available at the local library so I thought I'd check it out. I am very impressed with his abilities as a vocalist. He has a great stage presence and is reminiscent of Frank Sinatra. Some of the arrangements are the original arrangements by the artists who made the songs popular, and Buble does a great job following in their footsteps. Obviously, by the crowd reaction on this DVD, as well as by the fact that his albums are currently on the top of the jazz charts, he has a lot of supportive fans.    I must admit, the only somewhat negative comment that I have to say about Buble's singing, that he has a slight lisp at times that is a little annoying. I noticed that it seemed to come and go from song to song, and was more prominent when he sang then when he talked. Besides that, he has a great voice.    The band rocked out on here. Another thing I like about Buble is that he is very humble and always acknowledges the band members and their contributions. Michael Buble is on a ride right now towards fame, and he is enjoying every minute of it. He has solidified his position as the new male voice of jazz with this DVD/CD. I look forward to hearing other musical contributions by him.    There is one more side note that I'd like to make. This was released as a CD + DVD set. In my opinion, the extra CD really doesn't need to be included. I think he should have just released it as a DVD. The CD is only 30 minutes long, and is not as exciting to listen to as the DVD is to watch. I have become kind of a sucker for music DVD's lately because they are just as compact as CD's yet they have visual as well as audio. I suppose that releasing it as a CD + DVD is a somewhat unique marketing strategy, which could be why it was released as a CD + DVD set.
B0009RCPY8|4.0|What a blast from the past! I loved these films as a kid, and they really stand the test of time. The special effects don't look nearly as out of date as in other films from the same era. The jokes are still funny because they're timeless. It's great to see Aykroyd and Ramis subtly interact underneath some really witty dialogue, only to let Murray take it completely over the top.  <br />   The first disc contains some interesting interviews with the cast looking back on \\"Ghostbusters,\\" as well as some behind the scenes featurettes and deleted scenes. The second disc contains two episodes of the cartoon. These movies are still fun & make a great double feature. Who you gonna call?

1932907009|5.0|First off, I don't usually write rave reviews or a headline like the one above.  And maybe a part of my loving this book is that this book came at the right time in my writing life.  Which is to say that it's possible that other books would have impacted me the way that this one did.  Having said that, I can only say that after reading it, I feel certain that I will finish a script I was totally stymied on. <br /> <br />I do not like many movies, and I like precious few commercial ones.  So I have been quite resistant to thinking in terms of loglines and the correct page numbers when your \\"beats\\" must occur.  As a result it was hard for me to relate to portins of this book -- e.g. Blake's rapture over the title \\"Legally Blond\\" or his excited beat-by-beat breakdown of \\"Miss Congeniality,\\" a movie he obviously likes and that I haven't seen but know I would hate. <br /> <br />But after reading this book, I figured, what the hell (when you're stuck, you'll try about anything).  I'm going to try to create a logline for my movie.  And guess what?  I couldn't do it.  I couldn't come up with a succinct way to describe my movie, as Blake suggests in the book. <br /> <br />My first reaction (lasted about a month) was: who cares?  The movies I love can't be described in a logline.  End of story.  But then as I kept pushing myself to create a good logline, I started to realize that my movie was muddled.  And this had a lot to do with why I was stuck.  So I kept re-working my logline until my logline met Blake's conditions for a good logline.  And this led to me seeing my story more clearly.   <br /> <br />Is my story now more commercial, less artistic?  I don't know.  Less original?  I hope not.  All I know is I'm moving forward.  And I can't help but give this book a lot of credit for this.
0786939532|5.0|I have been a big fan of the Forgotten Realms setting in CRPG's, books and more. Of all the Realms novels I've read to date, this one is the best. This is the first R.A. Salvatore book i've read and I can honestly say its the first novel that I could barely put down. I've moved on to Exile, and will definitely read the rest of the Drizzt series. <br /> <br />The book was great, well written and it really gives you a strong insight and feel into the Underdark and the world of the dark elves known as Drow. The tales of the rival houses and Drow lifestyle kept me reading like an addict. Every other book i've rated a 5 should be dropped back to a 4 in the wake of this novel.  Recommended to any fantasy fan.

B000002I99|5.0|What makes this album so wonderful is that it has a little bit of everything.  Terror, humour, rock, jazz, soft ballads, angst, sinister narration (from the master of terror Vincent Price), and radio friendly hits.<br /><br />1975 was a great year for album rock.  This was the year I started listening to FM Rock in Detroit.  Although, I was looking for a station that was playing some of my new sound ventures (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, Yes, Strawbs, Pink Floyd, etc), this was also when I started to hear more great tunes from already established rock stars.<br /><br />The FM stations I was listening to in Detroit, WRIF and WABX, were playing other tracks (selected by the DJ's) from the new albums which stopped me from buying 45's and got me buying albums.  Nearly half the albums, hits and non-hits, would get some routine airplay that just made us anxious to own the albums, ourselves.<br /><br />In 1975, we were all talking about the great tracks from Aerosmith's \\"Toys in the Attic\\", Pink Floyd's \\"Wish You Were Here\\", Electric Light Orchestra's \\"Face the Music\\", Robin Trower's \\"Bridge of Sighs\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"Physical Graffiti\\", Sweet's \\"Desolation Boulevard\\", Queen's \\"A Night at the Opera\\", and then Alice Cooper's \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\".<br /><br />I'll never forget how wonderful FM rock was in 1975.  Back then, we thought every new album was released by an immortal Rock God!<br /><br />But, getting back to Alice Cooper, in general: I truly appreciate that Rhino Records re-released and remastered Alice Cooper's \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" and \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" which included bonus tracks and more.<br /><br />Rhino's 4 CD box set was rather a disappointment because they chopped up or only gave us \\"single\\" versions of many of his tracks.

0684833395|5.0|I love humor and satire books, and Catch-22 remains one of my all-time favorites. Logic and sense are completely discarded, but then at times throttled and twisted by every available character to the point where you find yourself agreeing with ridiculous arguments. Generals vie for power through a constantly deserting private who sells lighters, officers are assigned due to how appropriate their last name is, and medals are won by sheer cowardice. Heller's cast of characters, including the sex-crazed ex-photographer Hungry Joe, ever-lethargic Nately's whore, and hermit Major (named Major Major Major) stand out among fictional figures. The \\"protagonist,\\" Yossarian, is one of the few main characters in all of the war hero genre that not only begins but remains a selfish coward you cannot help but love. Over time I have bought several copies of this book just to lend out every one of them.
0792833201|5.0|I very vividly remember watching this at the theater with my cousin...we were both in our teens.  This movie and the greatest of them all, the Exorcist, are the only ones to actually make me walk away literally shaking.  When you can make 2 teenage guys so scared they're shaking in their shoes, you know you've got a scary film on your hands.  It blew us away like nothing has since.  Why can't someone make a scary movie like this anymore?
B000002J0B|5.0|Honestly, Led Zeppelin is the ONLY artist that can create monumental album after monumental album and have not ONE bad song.  When you listen to one of their albums in your car, there's no, \\"Oh, I really like track 2, but I don't like the next couple, so I'll skip to track 5 after that one's over.\\"  Now it is common opinion that the classic albums of Led Zeppelin are the first five, and \\"Houses of the Holy\\" is the fifth one.  This is Zeppelin at their pinnacle, which in my opinion, they never fall from.    \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" is Pagey at his best with his Gibson double-neck.  The song itself makes you want to ride the wind because it is so airy, but at the same time a fast-paced rock tune.  Page's initial (and INCREDIBLE) guitar solo makes this song the perfect initial song on this album.  \\"The Rain Song\\" is a lovelorn masterpiece with the lovely sounds of an orchestra to help create this mood.  The lyrics are deep, and while the song to me is melancholy, it is also refreshing.  \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" is a 5-trillion star song, with amazing acoustic and electric guitars with mystic lyrics.  \\"The Crunge\\" is groovy and funny.  The bass is really felt in this song, and odd spoken lyrics at the end give a laugh.  \\"Dancing Days\\" is very far out, but a summer-y song with an addictive riff.  \\"D'yer Mak'er\\" is one to definitely highlight Bonzo's masterful rhythm skills, or in other words, GREAT DRUMS!  Equal to that is Pagey on guitar and Robert's singing, \\"I still love you so...but I can't let you go...\\"  \\"No Quarter\\" is the quiet masterpiece that is credited to John Paul for an exquisite keyboard solo.  \\"The Ocean\\" is quite the upbeat song on this album with a raunchy riff.  An overall energizing song.    This is the best deal for this album--do not pass it up!  I hope this will be a permanent fixture to your collection...not one bad song.

B000FQJAIM|1.0|Or anything else Star Wars for that matter. <br /> <br />It's time to show George that he no longer rules the universe as he once did.  And the only way to do that is to hit him where he'll actually notice, his pocket book.  He obviously doesn't listen to anything or anyone else. <br /> <br />Why shouldn't you buy these Original Trilogy (OT) DVDs?   <br /> <br />First, the movies won't be anamorphic.  To quote Bill Hunt of The Digital Bits web site, \\"Anamorphic enhancement is the widely accepted industry standard for the presentation of widescreen films on DVD\\".  Is it really that bad that the movies won't be anamorphic, well not really, but it's symptomatic of the reasons for George releasing these movies.  He's only doing it because he's feeling forced to do, but he's not going to be nice about it, so no anamorphic print.  Very lame.  And besides, that process really doesn't cost all that much to begin with. <br /> <br />Second, according to George these movies will be from the best source material available, baloney.  They are from the Laserdisc masters, which for the time, were great.  But compared to today's movies they are sub-par.  Lucasfilm says there are no longer any valid \\"source material\\" copies of the OT because he had them all destroyed when they release the \\"Special Edition\\" version.  Again baloney.  Many copies of the original movies do exist in private collections, film history archives and other places that he cannot destroy.  Anyone of these could be used to create an true cleaned up OT version.  I still have my copy of the Star Wars: The Definitive Collection release and it's an okay print, but with a little cleaning up it could be fantastic. <br /> <br />Third, he says he doesn't want to allocate the resources to the cleanup.  Fine.  There are any number of studios who have said they would get better copies of the prints (even the source for the LD prints would be fine) and clean them up and make them anamorphic for no charge.  They just want tobe associated with the project. <br /> <br />Yes, they're his movies and he has the right to make changes (whether you agree or not with the changes) as he sees fit.  And while I don't like the changes he's made (especially in Star Wars which, in my opinion, were atrocious) I am willing to let the director do what he fells is best for his movies and support or not support these changes by purchasing or not purchasing the updated versions.  There will always be arguments about the validity of \\"Director's Cuts\\" (think Blade Runner and Brazil) but the simple answer is they are \\"Director's Cuts\\" and they can do what they want with \\"their\\" movies.  According to Lucas, the \\"Special Edition\\" version is the true vision that he had for the movies.  If that is truly the case George, why the waffling on the different OT versions.  Go with one and stick with it.  Period.  This so-called acquiescence to the fans to release the original movies has been downright insulting, condescending and not worthy of a studio as great as Lucasfilm is (or has been in the past).   <br /> <br />And the final reason to not buy these movies is simple:  George says he is releasing them to, and I'm paraphrasing here, \\"appease the fans\\".  Bull@#$!  He's releasing them for one simple reason.  Money.  Think about it.  Every time something new for Star Wars has come out, he's released some version on DVD.  He's planning on releasing a super-duper box set of all the movies in a couple of years as well as the HD-DVD versions, what kind of teasers is he going to release between now and then.  He knows he can release anything with the words Star Wars on them and we'll buy them. <br /> <br />Well not anymore for this consumer.  I've given ol' George the last dime I ever will.  In fact, I'm boxing up my \\"Special Edition\\" version of the OT on DVD and sending them back to George with this note.  I have the Laserdisc editions and while dated in their look and feel, they are truly the \\"original trilogy\\".  I might even send back all three prequel DVDs as well just to prove the point.

Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal? Then you're in for a treat with this album!

B000002GK1|5.0|This,in my opinion, is without a doubt the greatest grunge album of all time. It is just so heavy and raw that only a few people will enjoy it the first time they hear it. In fact, this album is sort of painful to listen to all the way through the first time. Stick with it though, because this album has no filler whatsoever. Buy it right away if you need some great hard rock.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|I really don't understand why this is called a punk album. It is too diverse to be called punk. The only song that could be called punk is \\"Death or Glory\\", but that one is one of the best songs on the album. This one bounces all over the place, from hard rock, to rockabilly, to reggae, to ska, to pop. It was also orginally a double album, which is surprising, considering that it is so consistant. There is only one filler track, \\"Lover's Rock\\", but that can be excused, since every other song is so great. This is recommended to anyone!
B000002G89|4.0|I have to confess that, while I love Clapton, his albums are often a hit-and-miss affair.  And I can't say I am a fan of the numerous recent blues tribute albums he has put out lately.  For me I enjoy his work with Cream, his guest work, his first few albums, the one he recorded with The Band, a few older live albums, and bits of the Phil Collins-produced record in the early 80s.  After that it's a fall-off, but I am thankful for all the great music he has turned out over the years.<br /><br />I have been listening to 461 a lot lately.  It holds up exceedingly well.  The groove is laid-back, with solid musicianship and expert song selection.  It makes for great road music, especially \\"Willie and the Hand Jive,\\" \\"I Shot the Sheriff,\\" and the classic closer, \\"Mainline Florida.\\"<br /><br />The ballads are beautiful, too.  There is not a weak track on the album.  There is a consistent tone, an aversion to excess and a concentration on the note and harmonic \\"fit\\" that makes this album an overall winner in EC's catalog.  As someone who used to party in EC's old house at 461 Ocean Boulevard in Golden Beach in the early 80s, let me say -- you did it (and us) proud.

I know that all serious U2 fans already have this amazing album, but if you are fan of the band, than get this album!
B000063JZQ|5.0|I use to loath Shakespeare until I saw this film.  In fact, I consider this film my favorite of Polanski's work.  It is very dark, extremely violent, bloody, and memorable.  I cannot think of another Polanski film that I remember as vividly, and Polanski has made many great, great films.<br /><br />Many remark on the violence in the film by saying it's over the top, but it isn't really.  It's a pretty gruesome but realistic depiction of warfare and the machinations of kings and politicos.  I find the film visually awesome, musically fine (a band called The Third Ear Band provide the music), the performances are excellent, and the overall attitude of the film is provocative without resorting to cheap shock value.  Seeing this film in a widescreen DVD (Polanski's framing is wonderful) is really heartening.  This is one of the finest adaptations of Shakespeare ever, and it's a shame that Polanski hasn't made anymore since.
B00099BPOW|5.0|I heard this record.  <br /> <br />Domingo is in great voice, and Abbado is just amazing.  This opera certainly requires great orchestration, and Abbado just makes it happen.  Unlike Muti who is way too rushed, and von Karajan who is too stiff, Abbado strikes a perfect balance;flexible, dramatic, well-paced,intellectual-he just makes the opera sing. <br /> <br />If you want great singing, the Tebaldi/Bergonzi is the best I've heard. But this one is the best overall.   <br /> <br />Thank you Claudio.
0060574216|1.0|I don't understand how Mr. Gray keeps on putting the initials PhD on his book covers. As most everyone knows by now, his PhD came from Columbia Pacific University which was a diploma mill. Hence, his book is about as void of substance as the degree he puts out on the cover. His views on understanding human nature is overly simplistic and trite. Between him and Dr. Phil, I'll have to go with the latter. At least Dr. Phil is a licensed clinical psychologist who got his PhD degree from a legitimate university (University of North Texas).
0446691437|4.0|In reviewing \\"The War of Art\\", \\"dyzml\\" believes that Steven Pressfield would consider Stephen King and Dean Koontz \\"hacks\\" for writing for a target audience.  This is a total misinterpretation of what Pressfield considers a \\"hack\\". <br /> <br />King and Koontz are obviously in love with the works they create, and are writing as much for themselves as they are for their audiences.  It shows.  If, on the other hand, they were creating works simply because they view an audience as a source of income, and tailor their books with high-concept hooks and dopey plotlines for that reason, then they would be true hacks, or Michael Crichton.  Not to get too far afield, but George Lucas has been saying for years that he wants to create \\"small, art movies,\\" despite sitting on a multi-billion dollar franchise that every art filmmaker would love to tap, and churning out zero art movies in 25 years.  Hack offender number one, if you ask me, and most certainly a victim of the Resistance Pressfield describes. <br /> <br />Additionally, Pressfield says about a thousand times to view yourself as a professional, and a professional works for money.  If one, in any field, creates work that she doesn't believe in, *simply* for money, then she *may* be a pro, but she's certainly a hack.  Also, Pressfield views \\"professionalism\\" as a state of mind, not defined by working on a project every single day.  If you have a day job, and expend as much energy as you *can* on your creative work, despite your fears, then you are a pro, whether you do it one day a week or seven. <br /> <br />On a more personal note, \\"dyzml\\" seems to think that Pressfield is a Christian (what page is that on?  I have the audio version of the book, perhaps abridged, but that fact is certainly never stated).  I'm a little offput by Pressfield's eccentric pseudo-religious, Greek God notions in the third part as well, but personally I find it terrifically refreshing that someone is so candid with what they really believe.  Try getting any \\"self-help\\" guru to be that open, not to mention funny. <br /> <br />I do disagree with some of Pressfield's cynicism of \\"being miserable\\" and \\"fighting\\" through your work (hence only 4 stars), as well as not being entitled to the \\"fruits of your labor\\" (if that was the case how could anyone make a living creating?)  He also, in a recorded interview, indicates that he lacks belief in the concept of \\"Flow,\\" a state I experienced for over six months, and many artists do as well. <br /> <br />But taking the hardcore approach during the times when things *don't* come so easily, is the best advice any beginning - or working - artist could receive.  For such real-world wisdom alone, I can't recommend this book enough.
B000F4PD7G|4.0|The movie titles over the ancient map with demons in the sea; the music of strings and drums sets the tone of otherworldlyness; tribal tales told round the campfire - and the dark beyond where terrors dwell.   Into this world of fable and myth we are told the tale of the hero Beowulf.  Is what we see and hear true - or along with other ancient stories, an entertainment to pass the time as we enjoy our drinks before sleep, as those ancient peoples did? <br /> <br />It has been over 60 years since I had to read Beowulf in Senior English.   All that I remember is it was a hero tale and I was glad to finish it.  But it did have a great hero. <br /> <br />I think the whole film is like a dream - not real, but fantasy.  We see Beowulf (Gerard Butler) emerging from the ice cold waters which would kill in minutes, to say G'day to a fisherman.  He is not cold - he is just wondering where he is. <br /> <br />In the opening moments we are introduced to the backstory of what happened to Grendel(Ingvar Sigurdsson), a troll, and why he is murdering the Danes.  The sea behind Grendel as this unfolds, with the huge ancient primeval rocks and the waves are awe inspiring, giving meaning to the quote \\"what is man that you are mindful of him?\\" <br /> <br />Back in Geatland, Beowulf hears of the Danes troubles and decides to take his warriors to rid his friend, King Hrothgar(Stellan Skarsgard) of the menace.    The meeting with the king and the next days, show him to be a drunken weakling.  And there is something not right. <br /> <br />Selma (Sarah Polley), a witch, sees with clear eyes, maybe because she is considered \\"the other\\" a nonperson who would be killed except for the troll.  For some reason he protects her.  This is a secret, along with others, that Beowulf will begin to uncover, until he has become aware that all is not as it seems.  Is he doing good?  or evil?   <br /> <br />The final denouement of Grendal is gruesome but the final honor paid by Beowulf to him is sad and dignified. <br /> <br />Comments:  Of the cast, Butler is perfect as the conflicted warrior, big, strong and questioning. <br /> <br />I was most dissapointed in Skarsgard.  After reading so many comments praising his performance maybe I expected more.  I thought he overdid some of his scenes and other lines just threw away.  He just did not make me feel anything for this wimpy king.  <br /> <br />Sigurdsson was okay but again, I was expecting to feel more for him after reading soooo much praise for his performance. <br /> <br />Sarah Polley is the one I thought was spot on.  Now this is where I canna understand the dissing she has had over her Selma.  I GOT it and thought it was most telling that no one mentions the horror that her character must have endured by the time Beowulf meets her.  She asks him, when he mentions that both there peoples were annihilated by the same tribe, \\"but did they make you a whore?\\"  I thought Polley played her as a survivor, and did it well. <br /> <br />The priest - was he supposed to be going mad?  That is the way I felt. <br /> <br />The Iceland horses - I loved watching the riders.  Did you notice that their gait makes the rider almost completely motionless?  No bouncing around.  The Tennessee Walker, that people ride  in the US who have to be riding all day, has the same gate.  The horse does the moving, the rider is still.  I thought the shot of all of the Geats riding towards the waterfall was great.  No laughing from me.  <br /> <br />The language.  Come on!!!  This is so tame I hardly noticed it - I was expecting something like  \\"GoodFellas\\" with every other word a curseword.  Sorry, I was underwhelmed - seemed just about right for a bunch of men doing the dirty work of killing for the citizens. <br /> <br />Beowulfs comment on seeing the glacier \\"We're in a different world here\\"  and his final words \\"Sleep Grendel\\" brought tears to my eyes. <br /> <br />A wonderful trip indeed into \\"a different world.\\"  A myth - told round thecampfire.  And the monsters are still out there in the dark. <br /> <br />This was a review of the DVD.  Rating 9/10 <br /> <br />
B000002LCE|5.0|Yes it is really that good. Many people put The Last in Line behind Holy Diver but I have always liked this album more. Not a weak song on it.<br /><br />As a fan of Dio from his Rainbow days I would grab up his solo albums as soon as they came out. I was a little worried when Vivian Campbell left the band and was replaced by Craig Goldy, but after 1 listen to this album I was blown away. Goldy is more than a passable replacement for Campbell. In fact I would go so far as to say he is every bit Campbell's equal and his guitar work on this Dio album, and others, is outstanding.<br /><br />From the opening riff of Night People, which is a great opener, to the last tone of When a Woman Cries this album is fantastic.<br /><br />My favorite tracks on it are:<br /><br />Night People<br /><br />Dream Evil<br /><br />Sunset Superman<br /><br />All the Fools Sailed Away<br /><br />Overlove<br /><br />I Could Have Been a Dreamer.<br /><br />As you can see that is 6 of the 9 tracks on the album. Not to say the other 3 tracks aren't good, they are, I just like those 6 songs the best.<br /><br />Buy it, you won't be disappointed.

B00005JMYI|4.0|Will Ferrell is simply one of the finest comic actors of his generation. His comedic style isn't suddle at all and he is so clumsy and akward on screen you can't help but LOVE him... Former SNL star turn superstar Ferrell has made a name for himself as the comedic willing to go the extra mile for another slapstick joke- Anchorman- written and I believed produced by Ferrell is no differant.<br /><br />Ever absurd incident is hillarous and although the movie itself is absurdity of situations from Ferrell playing the jazz flute, to having his dog drop-kicked off the side of a bridge because of an anger motorist, to having an all out battle between all the news stations involving a man on being on fire and a grenade... Ferrell's amazing absurdity of events seem to work to create a movie that my ten year-old brother and I LOVE to watch...It's the perfect choice on family movie night for us because both the kids and adults seem to enjoy it together...<br /><br />It's movie about a time when everyone believed what they heard on TV and only men where allowed to read the news. Arrogant and over the top Ron Burgandy(Will Ferrell) the man about town is suddenly threatened when Veronica Cornerstone(Christina Applegate) takes the position as co-anchor. The two mutual hate eachother- Ron who reads anything off the telepromter is uncermoniasly fired when Veronica puts \\"Go F*** yourself San Diego\\" during a broadcast. Ron's life halts and with a absurd amount of ridicolous issues the story ends with a \\"life-changing\\" happy ending.<br /><br />Although corny, and slap-sticky the movie is still enjoyable because of it's all-star cast and the amazing comic genius of Will Ferrell who gives his best performance(even better then Old School).<br /><br />The kids and adults in our family seem to enjoy it on family movie night making it a good movie to rent or own in your collection!
B000EGCITG|5.0|I am not at all a fan of Pink's debut CD.  However, when \\"Missundaztood\\" came out I found myself singing along with all the radio hits from the album whenever I heard them.  I really love the song \\"Just Like A Pill\\", it probably single handedly grabbed my attention when it came to Pink.  Then it seemed that the \\"Try This\\" album didn't get much airplay and all of a sudden people are saying, \\"Where is Pink, I haven't heard anything from her in awhile.\\" <br /> <br />\\"I'm Not Dead\\" is not only proof that Pink is still around, but proof of quite the contrary.  If she keeps writing music like this CD, she will continue to make footprints for awhile.  There really is not a bad song on the album.  It is also quite diverse.  There are a few flashy pop tunes, a few tunes that really rock, and even some Joplinesque ballads.  Some of her lyrics are very well written and you get a sense of getting a window into her soul.  Stand outs include \\"Who Knew\\", \\"I'm Not Dead\\", \\"Runaway\\", and \\"Long Way To Happy\\" (which is a drastic oversite if it never becomes a single)  \\"U and Ur Hand\\" and \\"The One That Got Away\\" also stand out, as well as the first single, \\"Stupid Girls\\" (halarious video!).  With \\"I'm Not Dead\\", Pink has finally come into her own as an artist and a songwriter.  She has written an album full of catchy, polished, and well written songs.  After listening to a CD like this, I definitely hope that Pink stays \\"Not Dead\\".
B000002UA2|4.0|Obscured by Clouds, the other soundtrack album if you will, is one of their best in terms of the actual songs themselves.  I would say the songs on here are better than on Dark Side of the Moon it's just that Dark Side had all the cool sound effects and the concept album feel.  Now onto the album itself.  It starts wonderfully with \\"Obscured by Clouds\\" and \\"When You're In\\".  I'm not usually a fan of instrumentals but these two are very well done and set the tone for the album.  Next is \\"Burning Bridges\\" which is a good Waters/Wright song.  After that is the upbeat rocker, yes kids thats right an upbeat Pink Floyd song called \\"The Gold It's In the..\\" which is just a simple song about going out and looking for gold i suppose.  Next is the best song on the album and one of my favorite Floyd songs of all time.  \\"Wot's...Uh the Deal?\\" is a slower acoustic sounding number that is just beautiful in every sense of the word.  I especially love the use of electric guitar in the middle and the lyrics are just fantastic.  After that we get \\"Mudmen\\" which is a nice and has good Gilmour guitar in it.  We get more Gilmour in the next song \\"Childhood's End\\" which seems as a precursor to \\"Time\\" as they both have the same sound going on.  \\"Free Four\\" is considered by some the best album on here and it is definetly an interesting song.  Deathly lyrics set to what sounds like a Floyd version of \\"Spirit in the Sky\\".  Now this wouldn't be a Pink Floyd album without a little bit of Rick Wright so he brings us \\"Stay\\" which is one of his better songs and I like the overall sound of it.  Than we close on a downer \\"Absolutely Curtians\\" which is horrendous.  It's boring and those chants are not even needed.  But don't let one song ruin the expierence for you it is one of the better Pink Floyd albums and has one of their better songs on it.  So if you don't have it and you consider yourself a Floyd fan, go get it.  You won't be disappointed.

0743539125|5.0|Lincoln led our country through it's most contentious, violent and deadly historical period.  Historians will probably always debate if his methods of change were too quick, creating too many unnecessary casualties.  But the issues were so great and so consequential for human rights and for government by the people.<br /><br />Lincoln's greatest political rival to win the Presidential nomination was William H. Seward.<br /><br />I will have to re-listen to this biography repeatedly to try and decipher more of Lincoln's methods and genius, because I have not discerned many of them in the first listening.<br /><br />Richard Thomas (The Waltons' John Boy) reads this biography extremely well.<br /><br />Lincoln, through methods I will likely never be able to capably emulate or comprehend, was able to make close friends out of some of his most significant rivals.<br /><br />For those of you who don't recall the history, when Lincoln was assassinated, the plan was to assassinate his Secretary of State Seward, and Vice President Johnson simultaneously (much like modern terrorism's trend to time multiple violent events simultaneously).  Seward barely survived due to some freak circumstances.  As Seward was recovering, for several days no one told him the President had been killed so that he did not have that concern during his intensive care recovery.<br /><br />However, Seward looked outside his hospital window and saw the flag at half mast and said to the man attending him, \\"The President is dead.\\"  The man, following orders, tried to deny it.  But Seward continued, \\"Because if he were not, he would have been the first to visit me.\\"  I cried upon hearing this (and during the recounting of Lincoln's son's death).  The book does an excellent job of reminding us of the fears we have of losing people we love.<br /><br />I recommend this book on tape for it's replayability.  Lincoln believed in reconciliation.  He believed in not trampling on a defeated enemy.  He had great compassion for the Confederate soldiers.  He was a man of letters.  He was a man who believed in the importance of well phrased writing.  Somehow, through his constant humor and fitting anecdotes, he mades friends of enemies.  I aspire to learn more of his wisdom, for he had skills I don't possess.<br /><br />I recommend buying this book on tape.  When you aren't using it, pass it around to your friends, family, and children.was a man of letters.  He was a man who believed in the importance of well phrased writing.

B000001Y79|5.0|This is the best album No Doubt has ever made. I still remember in 1996 when don't speak was No.1 for long weeks. I thunk this song is the best No doubt has ever made. A performance deserving a standing ovation. The rate lies down:<br /><br />1. Spiderwebs. A great intro. This song is what defines No Doubt style to my opinion. I love this one. 10/10<br /><br />2. Excuse me mr. I don't like this song that much. I think ''Sixteen'' should have been released as a single instead of this one. The lyrics, don't make much sense, but the piano sounds good. 6/10<br /><br />3. Just a Girl. A very nice song about teenager girls. The guitar sounds great. 10/10<br /><br />4. Happy Now? This song sounds good. I like it.9/10<br /><br />5. Different People. Nice intro. The rest, isn't that bad. 8/10<br /><br />6. Hey You. The first time I saw this song title, before I listened to it, I thought It was a remake of Pink Floyd's. This song is the strongest one. It's just rock. Doesn't have any reggae, pop or ska rythm. One of my favourites. 10/10<br /><br />7. The Climb. It didn't have to take much time. This song is the boring slow one. Is actualy quiet good, but is the longest one, and it wasn't necessary at all. Up to 6 minutes!! 8/10<br /><br />8. Sixteen. One of my favourites. One of the best rock songs No Doubt has ever made. It had been released as a single and I bet it would have reached the number one for weeks! Starts great, is the song that makes you stand up and jump. I was 16, and I felt like this song was to me. I felt identified with it.''You're only sixteen and you're feeling old...'' And it ends when Sunday Morning starts, with the drums. 10/10<br /><br />9. Sunday Morning. I love how the song sounds, it's geat! but the lyrics doesn't help that much. But I don't care, I like it! One of my favourites. 10/10<br /><br />10. Don't Speak. I have no words to describe this song. The lyrics, the sound, everything on this song is great! I think this is the best No Doubt song on their 5 studio albums!<br /><br />A strong ballad. ''As we die, both you and I, with my head in my hands I sit and cry...''.10/10<br /><br />11. You can do it. Doesn't sound that good. This song shouldn't have been included on this album. Is just the worst. I don't like it. 3/10<br /><br />12. A very nice song. ''We gotta fing another way to make the world go 'round.'' The lyrics are great. Is just about rality. I love this song. 10/10<br /><br />13. End it on this. A good one. Not that bad. 9/10<br /><br />14. Tragic Kingdom. This song is like the cherry on the cake.

0446525537|5.0|This book was excellent. The character's names are the same but with plot twists and a whole different background scheme-the book is alot different than the movie-except one thing- it's also a huge tear jerker.<br /><br />The book reads fast-finished it in one night- and Sparks creates each character just as vividly and complete as Tolken but with less pages and more concise.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book and would def recommend it for any romantic, Sparks fans, or any fan of the movie. Excellent to re-read and have as part of your book collection.

0553584537|4.0|I would probably agree with some reviewers here that this is not Lisa Gardner's best work, but it is still very good as are all her novels.  True, the hero (Bobby) was something of an idiot when it came to making decisions and the heroine (Catherine) was simply not sympathetic but they had some interesting interplay and the plot kept moving.  The climax was predictable, but it seemed as it was intended to be that way.  This was not a real 'mystery' story.  The murderer and the villain behind him were pretty obvious.  Few reviewers chose to mention the psychiatrist, Dr. Lane. I was facinated with her character and thought it was very well developed and greatly added to the entire tone of the novel.  Another doctor was named 'Gerritsen', making me wonder if this was a winking reference to one of my other favorite writers, Dr. Tess Gerritsen.   I gave this book 4 stars.  Very enjoyable.  Probably more enjoyable for people who have read other works by Lisa Gardner.  Loyal fans.
B000A7S4B0|4.0|I'm going to start this little diatribe off with the information that I wasn't a fan of the last two Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, two records that to me seemed to be more about postering than songwriting. That's why it took me so long to catch up with the groups third studo effort \\"Howl\\". <br />I had no intention on getting this record because of said reasons, but I was more than a little curious after hearing the band perform on the Henry Rollins show. So when I came across the record at my local used CD store for a whopping six bucks I decided to give it a shot. What the Hell right? If it sucks I can at least get a couple bucks back when I trade it back in. <br />Now I have no intention of doing that. \\"Howl\\" leaves almost everything of their previous \\"American Jesus and Mary Chain\\" sound, trading it in for a great mix of gospel, blues, folk, country and southern rock. Every song on \\"Howl\\" is good, and the group avoid monotony by adding different instrumentation to the various tracks, giving each track an indivdual sound without leaving the feel for a complete album. <br />I'm told this album has some sort of album protection on it, making it difficult to put on your MP3 player(though if you are resourceful you can do it, believe you me), but I don't rate records on that because, hey, we're talking about a record here, not something for technology. And as an album \\"Howl\\" is one of the best records of '05, as well as one of the best of the past few years.
B0009F9O6W|5.0|Released in 1971, this album is regarded by many fans as the finest material VDGG ever recorded.  I certainly share this enthusiasm and Pawn Hearts ranks right up there with my top ten prog albums of all time. Ever.  This is difficult listening however, and themes of despair and paranoia abound, which are wonderfully brought to life in all of their twisted glory with Peter Hamill's anguished lyrics.<br /><br />The members of the band at this point included the classic VDGG lineup: Hugh Banton (Hammond E&C organs, Farfisa professional organ, piano, mellotron, ARP synthesizer, bass pedals, bass guitar, and vocals); Peter Hammill (lead vocals, acoustic and slide guitar, electric piano, and acoustic piano); superb drummer Guy Evans; and David Jackson (flute, tenor/alto/soprano saxophones).  All of the musicians are very good with Guy being an exceptional drummer - just like all of the other remastered VDGG albums, the subtle intricacies of his drumming really come across.  The ensemble work is also pretty good too.  Before I forget, Robert Fripp (of King Crimson) contributed a tiny bit of electric guitar here and there - it's barely noticeable though.<br /><br />Now for my favorite part - the music.  The album is comprised of two longer pieces (11'39\\" and 10'22\\") with the massive 23'05 multimovement suite A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers as the centerpiece.  The music is, for the most part, harsh and unyielding with only the briefest moments of reprieve.  Hugh's alternately twisted and churchy organ work really drives each piece along, with Dave's angular and jagged sax work slashing through each piece like so many shards of broken glass.  OK, maybe that last bit is a little over the top, but it is not far from the truth.  Although the music is very heavy, there are a few quieter and haunting moments.  The introduction to Man Erg comes to mind as the best example, although those moments (albeit fleeting moments) are pretty much scattered across the album.  Last but not least, is Peter Hammill's incredible and very distinctive vocal delivery.  He had developed a vocal style over the course of three albums that ranged from a heavy metal rasp to a high pitched falsetto \\"choir boy\\" vocal style and it is brought to perfection on this album.  He also screams/rants during certain frenzied passages on the feverish closing track, A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers.  Although some people feel that his vocal style is overly theatrical I have to admit that I absolutely love it - In fact, I am of the opinion that VDGG would not be VDGG without Peter Hammill.<br /><br />The EMI remastered album is incredible and features restored cover art and band publicity photos/live shots along with an extraordinary improvement in the sound quality.  The improvement is so great that it is like listening to a completely different recording - every nuance is brought out and you can even hear subtle synthesizer effects and percussion parts that had previously gone unheard.  The liner notes include all of the lyrics along with a ton of informative liner notes.  The bonus tracks are also really good too (well, maybe the dinner time jazz of Ponker's Theme is not so great) and are outtakes from the 1971 Pawn Hearts sessions.  I think that of all the bonus tracks, Diminutions is the most interesting because it is so unlike VDGG.  It is very spacey and consists simply of long, drawn out passages on synthesizers and organ over a period of six minutes or so - in fact it sounds more like electronic artists such as Tangerine Dream or Klaus Schulze.<br /><br />Well I have gushed over this incredible album long enough, although I could easily go on for another 20 pages.  Suffice it to say that this is VDGG's finest recorded moment and is very highly recommended along with H to He, He who am the Only One (1970) and Still Life (1976).<br /><br />One more thing - this was the last album VDGG released before regrouping and releasing Godbluff in 1975.Hammill's incredible and very distinctive vocal delivery.

B000002552|3.0|I know, I know . . . it seems inevitable perhaps that one will be produced someday.  But as Columbia (and Dylan himself) have made major errors in reading the public's desires (see Infidels and the upcoming Bootleg Series addition) when and if in fact this will happen is anyone's guess.  So I propose that anyone who would like to see a re-mastered authoritative edition (and not another \\"best-of\\" watered down compilation of live or alternate versions of Dylan tunes that, while wonderful, have been packaged and re-packaged in some form or another over and over again  - - how many live versions of \\"Blowin' In the Wind\\" do we need anyway?) of some of the finest material Dylan ever produced (\\"Sign On the Cross\\" and \\"I'm Not There (1956)\\" (the latter of which has provided the title for a MAJOR MOTION PICTURE for God's sake) as well as covers of \\"Four Strong Winds\\" and \\"A Fool Such As I\\" and alternate tracks of great, if lesser known, tunes too numerous to list here) please take the advantage of this forum and simply respond to this review as helpful.  Perhaps then Columbia will get the message.  And hopefully they'll have the wherewithal to hire someone like Greil Marcus or Paul Williams (and not Jeff Rosen, who should have been fired from the Bootleg Series long ago) to oversee the project and make sure this music is finally given the treatment it deserves.  \\"Some of these bootleggers, they make pretty good stuff.\\"

The sound is pretty glorious throughout, and now that I've had a chance to give it a really critical listening, I can definitely say it's better than Atlantic's and Joe Gastwirt/Ocean View Digital's first digital remastering that was released a few years back (not to be confused with the initial CD transfer, which fell very flat sonically, as did most CDs of that time). During my first listening, I particularly noticed that the atmospeherics of \\"Guinnevere\\" stand out, as does the clarity of the vocal lines in \\"Helplessly Hoping.\\" In fact, all the vocals are outstandingly clear, making the trademark three-part harmonies much easier to follow individually. In general, the whole album is a little more 3-dimensional, allowing you to hear into the mix a little bit better. And during the moments when it gets loud, it doesn't get quite as congested as the earlier remaster. The differences are subtle, but definitely audible.    The release has some new liner notes, including comments from the three principals, plus 3 previously unreleased versions of songs that would appear later in their collective and individual careers: Crosby's \\"Song with No Words,\\" Still's \\"Do for the Others\\" and Nash's \\"Teach Your Children,\\" plus a Stills cover of Fred Neil's \\"Everbody's Talkin'\\" (the song that provided a big hit for Harry Nilsson). The booklet also includes a reproduction of the original lyric sheet with artwork, which I remember hearing never made its way into all copies of the original LP.    Strangely, however, they changed the cover photo so Dallas Taylor, the drummer on the original album, is no longer shown peering through the glass in the door of the house. At first I thought he had been photoshopped out of the picture until I did a little research and learned that hewasn't at the original photo shoot to begin with and his image was added later before producing and printing the cover art. I'm all for purity and everything, but since one could argue that the whole point of the reissue is to restore the original as much as possible, why bother changing it? The public had never seen the photo without Taylor, so what was gained in leaving him out?    Another change, and one that I find extremely disappointing, is the elimination of Crosby's barely audible \\"Long Time Gone\\" tag, in which he sings Robert Johnson's phrase, \\"You better come in my kitchen because it's going to be raining outside.\\" Wikipedia tells us that it was removed at the request of Johnson's family, though no further reason is given. Various message board participants claim that Johnson's estate wanted a great deal of compensation for its use. That answer seems more likely, as it would appear that no real benefit could accrue to Johnson's family simply by eliminating recordings of his songs where they had previously existed. Whatever the reason, removing it creates a diminished package, in my opinion. At least the previous Atlantic remastering still contains it, where it appears as the intro to \\"49 Bye-Byes.\\" I'm glad I have that versison, and don't plan on getting rid of it despite getting this new and sonically improved version.    One other small but important change - the songwriting credit for \\"Wooden Ships\\" now lists Paul Kantner as a cowriter, along with Crosby and Stills, which I'm told is the way the song was credited when it appeared on Jefferson Airplane's \\"Volunteers.\\"
B00015YVD6|3.0|Saw this one years ago, and decided to watch it again.  Not as funny as I remembered, but very sweet and touching.  Great performances by Tom Hanks and Daryl Hannah, though John Candy has never been one of my favorites.  Good special features on the 20th anniversary edition.  Hard to believe this movie is 22 years old.
B00006JKOL|5.0|To most Tull fans it is no surprise that \\"Minstrel\\" ranks up there with the \\"Tull Greats.\\" Ian even placed a line in the lyrics \\"When all is said and all is done, couldn't wish for a better one.\\" I believe he comented after in an interview that he alawys felt that way when they finished recording a new album. This piece of music is well over 30 years old but recently I decided to add it to my CD collection and boy am I glad I did. I forgot what a great piece of music \\"Baker Street Muse\\" was/is. For me to try and give a review is foolish and also needless. The Tull fans know it already and most likely own this as well as the others. The non-believers just dont get it anyway and never will. Tull music has always had that kind of appeal. Its simple. The fans love it - the rest of you idiots will never feel it, hear it, or whatever-it. Too bad for you. Anyway, If sometimes I write to a cynical degree, It's just the nonsense thats it seems, As I drift down through the Baker Street valley ...... Ciao for now, What? - I can't get out! <br />Arnold Visconti <br />Tull fan to the end.
B000B8QEYC|2.0|After much anticipation, 5 years to be exact, \\"Amarantine\\" is finally released.  And despite the positive reviews that it received, by other Enya fans around the world, I find this recording to be a disappointment.  It is nothing more than a derivation of \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" except it lacks the lyrical beauty and originality that existed in the latter one.  There is not a song that stands out.  Much of the music and rhythms are very similar and too repetitive.  The usage of the made up Loxian language seems to be a bit of a far stretch of creativity.  There are more than 6,800 spoken languages in more than 220 countries around the world.  Beyond the languages of English, Gaelic, Latin that she normally sang, Enya could have picked other known languages to learn, why the need for a new language which no one else, except for its creator, can relate to?  This seems to be rather silly.<br /><br />I meant no disrespect to Enya or her music as I have enjoyed much of it over the years.  Enya's voice remains as beautiful as it always has been.  This recording, however, leaves me with very little excitement towards her next release.  I hope the next one will be better.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|Donnie Darko is a must see.  One of the greats, and this version of it only makes it that much better
B000002J27|5.0|I'd like to pay homage to the No. 1 album in my 600-cd collection of rock and jazz, and  -  in my humble estimation  -  the greatest album of all time:  \\"A Trick of the Tail\\".<br /><br />Superlatives tossed about carelessly?  No.  Blind praise done in isolation?  No.  Irrational band fanatic?  Please....<br /><br />Yeah, I was a newly-independent college freshman in 1975 when I first heard this album that dared to compete with any Gabriel-era album, so there may be some emotional and sentimental bias in my regard for this album.  But let's look objectively at this brilliant album on the whole:<br />1.) A beautiful canary yellow album cover and inner sleeve (with the original vinyl, anyway) that portrayed many of the characters from the songs.<br />2.) Complete lyrics spread out across the original fold-out album cover, printed in a suitable scroll (and what INCREDIBLE lyrics they are!)<br />3.) A true \\"concept album\\" (How come nobody else mentions this?!) where virtually every song relates the paradox of a person (or thing) that doesn't realize how good they already have it, and instead long for something different.  (The grass ISN'T always greener on the other side.)  And I detect in many songs the presence of a devil figure who preys on the doubts and weakness of the song's character, who winds up making a \\"deal with the devil\\" to get their perceived needs.  I mean, to me, that's a devil figure singing \\"Dance on a Volcano\\", right?  (\\"The lava's the lover...\\",  and what about \\"the evil of a snowflake in June...\\"  etc.)<br /><br />And I haven't even mentioned the music itself yet!<br /><br />Tony Banks writes or co-writes every song, and they drip with his trademark sense for subtly changing keys from major to minor to harmonic to new keys, etc.  His wall of sound arsenal of keyboards dominates on this album.  Phil Collins' voice and harmonies on this album suit the lyrics perfectly (sorry, I did not miss Peter), and his drumming is often a tour-de-force, especially important in the near jazz-fusion of some of the instrumentals.<br /><br />Steve Hackett gets a good chance to show off on this album with acrobatic guitar licks and solos that sometimes get overlooked because of the unusual tone of his guitar that almost sounds like a keyboard.  And aside from his usual fine bass work, Mike Rutherford strums along with Hackett and Banks (just like in the earlier days) on a couple of classic slower songs  -  the dreamy \\"Entangled\\" and the inspirational \\"Ripples\\".  (Banks also supplies some great backing vocals on the album.  NOT Mike Rutherford, though ;-)<br /><br />The lyrics frequently intone a sense of regret, even though things may not really be as bad as the character perceives them.  Were regret and pity the initial overall feelings of the remaining band members when Gabriel decided to leave them, only to later realize that maybe instead of feeling sorry for themselves and drowning in their pity, they should put all of their forces together to show the music world something definitive?  Hmmmm....<br /><br />Peter Gabriel was viewed by many as the \\"head\\" of Genesis; I believe that the remaining members of the group were determined to make a statement with this album, and perform a kind of \\"trick\\" that only the \\"tail\\" of the group could pull off.  And they did.  Perfectly.  They even managed to pay homage to PG in the closing lines of the last song: after tying many of the major themes of the album together in \\"Los Endos\\" (like any great work will recapitulate its themes), Collins salutes Gabriel as he wails in the background a line from \\"Supper's Ready\\" - \\"There's an angel standing in the sun...Free to get back home.\\"<br /><br />Not a weak track to be found, not a bad moment to be had.  Few other artists have ever achieved such a level of overall perfection as Genesis did on this album  -  great songwriting, inventive solos and instrumentals, virtuoso performances, interesting lyrics, great production, super artwork, and a great and original concept that tied the group's real world situation to the world of imagination and stories to which staunch Genesis fans had already become familiar in earlier albums.  I love the moral and resolve of this album.<br /><br />As I write this, \\"A Trick of the Tail\\" is thirty years young, and I'll keep listening to this album frequently for many years to come.  I admit that musical tastes are intensely personal, and it's often tough to find common ground among lovers of the various genres of rock (or even among the many progressive rock camps).  But this album does EVERYTHING right; for MY tastes, it is the oft-sought \\"perfect album\\"!<br /><br />I value interesting music that is played and recorded well.  This cd's rating was based on:<br />Music quality = 9.8/10;  Performance = 10/10;  Production = 9.5/10;  CD length = 9/10.<br />Overall score weighted on my proprietary scale = 9.8  (\\"5 stars\\")the world of imagination and stories to which staunch Genesis fans had already become familiar in earlier albums.

0316168815|4.0|Suzie Salmon, age 14, is raped and murdered by a serial killer. She tells her story from heaven as she watches over her grieving family. Her death rips apart the secure suburban landscape of her home and deeply impacts not only her family but also some of her friends and neighbors. Over the years, Suzie watches these people, as well as her killer, and takes part in their changes and growth from afar. Ultimately, Suzie must come to terms with her own death, but her imprint remains on the world she left behind and she can never completely leave earth behind. The point of view is fairly unique for a mass-market text, and the writing style is clean, personal, and skillful. The Lovely Bones is a unique, alternative coming-of-age story that reads quickly without being cheap and tugs heartstrings without being maudlin. However, the ease with which Suzie accepts her rape and then her death seems unrealistic, and some of the supernatural events exceed the reader's ability to suspend disbelief. The book has its flaws, but it's still an interesting and emotional read. I recommend it tentatively: there are other, more important books out there, but for a quick, somewhat simple modern text, this book is pretty good.<br /><br />All of my problems with the book came later in the text, and so to avoid spoiling the story I can't discuss them in detail. However, I will say this: Suzie's recovery from her rape and death, as well as the surreal, supernatural relationship that she has with Earth and those she has left behind is a little too unrealistic for the reader to accept the story in full. Her recovery is too smooth and too easy, undercutting the severity of what happens to her and coming to an incredibly unrealistic emotional and physical climax. The same climax is also the most supernatural moment of the book. That moment stretches the reader's ability to suspend disbelief to a breaking point. While the rest of the ghostly aspects seem possible, this final one does not. As a result, the climax to the story is the most unfulfilled and unwelcome part of the book. It disrupts the flow, which until then has been smooth and natural. Furthermore, in a book about human experiences that is based so much in character that than plot, the climax isn't even necessary. In my view, it's a poor choice by the author and takes the entire book down a notch.<br /><br />That said, the rest of the novel is pretty good. Sebold has a simple, clean, light writing style which is a pleasure to read. The plot is new and interesting. Characters are, for the most part, realistic, recognizable, and interesting. It's an easy text to get sucked in to, emotional but not over the top, and a interesting, hopeful new take on the average coming-of-age story. I enjoyed it, and while I don't think it is a classic it was a fairly good book and it makes a nice break from longer, heavier, more difficult texts. I recommend it on that basis: this isn't the book of a lifetime, but it's a solid, interesting, skillful read.esult, the climax to the story is the most unfulfilled and unwelcome part of the book.

B000084T18|5.0|The debut of 50 Cent was surrouded by so much hype that it was almost impossible to live up to the expectations. But 50 does it, and does it well, dropping not only a classic debut, but a classic altogether. The opening five songs are absolutely flawless and include monster hits such as \\"Many Men\\", \\"In Da Club\\", and \\"High All The Time\\". Other smashes include \\"Blood Hound\\", \\"Back Down\\", \\"P.I.M.P.\\", \\"21 Questions\\", \\"Don't Push Me\\", and the bonus cut, \\"Wanksta\\". As you can see, \\"Get Rich\\" is loaded with excellent tracks, and the ones that aren't stand outs can't be taken lightly. I can't say that a single song is poorly done, and in today's hip-hop world, that is really saying something. 50 has a flow that can't be touched, and combined with the banging beats and thuggish, street-life lyrics, \\"Get Rich\\" is one of the most powerful hip-hop albums ever created. Pick this up if you enjoy rap, hip-hop, and even R&b, for this album is sure to please you.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|With this release A Perfect Circle really did show what they were capable of. This has to be my all time favorite release by the band. I love everything about this album because from start to finish it stays great. That is if we ignore the track \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\". I'm not quite sure what to make of this song. My guess is it's something to lighten the mood but it doesn't harm the album all that much anyway, just adds to its awesomeness. To think that it only took them 2 years to create such a masterpiece. My favorite tracks are probably \\"The Package\\", \\"The Noose\\", \\"The Outsider\\", and \\"Gravity\\". Anyway here's what I think of the whole album...<br /><br />1. The Package - 10/10<br /><br />2. Weak And Powerless - 10/10<br /><br />3. The Noose - 10/10<br /><br />4. Blue - 10/10<br /><br />5. Vanishing - 10/10<br /><br />6. A Stranger - 10/10<br /><br />7. The Outsider - 10/10<br /><br />8. Crimes - 10/10<br /><br />9. The Nurse Who Loved Me - 6/10<br /><br />10. Pet - 10/10<br /><br />11. Lullaby - 9/10<br /><br />12. Gravity - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 96% A<br /><br />Everything on this album just flows. It just seems to make up what APC is about. The whole album is just a mixture of soft, hard, and sometimes even funny moments. \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is a prime example of why I love A Perfect Circle. It's APC at their finest.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|With their third release, Godsmack really shines, harder and better than ever before. A strong, radio-ready hit opens the album with \\"Straight Out of Line\\". Godsmack continues the energy rise with the next two tracks, \\"Faceless\\", and \\"Changes\\". And perhaps the most powerful song they've ever recorded comes into play at #5, \\"I Stand Alone\\", in my opinion, one of the best heavy rock songs ever recorded. They continue the awesome song trend with \\"Re-Align\\", a softer side where the lyrics absolutely shine. Next, a throwback to their debut with \\"I F*****g Hate You\\", an angry song that bristles with tension and malice. Another stand-out is \\"I Am\\", in which lead singer Sully Erna declares \\"death will come when i'm good and God d**n ready\\". And Godsmack does it again with the melodic, almost tribal \\"Serenity\\", where the chanting chorus can make your heart pump with intensity. Overall, this is their best record yet and an excellent purchase. This album apppeals to all rock fans who love quality music. An awesome album.
B000002NIW|5.0|\\"Around the fur\\" is a pretty good album for what it is. It's heavy but not too heavy which is just where I like it. I normally don't enjoy metal where they scream but with Deftones I can make an exception. Their music is just much more artful and it kind of takes you on a ride all the way through the entire album. From the soft suffocating vocal parts to the anger induced screams and heavy riffs, it's all good. This was actually the first album I picked up by the band. I got it on a whim after hearing \\"My Own Summer\\" on the radio. I was not disappointed. I still think \\"White Pony\\" is a much better album but \\"Around The Fur\\" is still its own unique piece. Probably the best tracks on the album are \\"My Own Summer\\", \\"Around the Fur\\", \\"MX\\", and \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\". \\"Dai The Flu\\" is also pretty awesome. Here's what I think of the rest of the album...<br /><br />1. My Own Summer (Shove It) - 10/10<br />2. Lhabia - 9/10<br />3. Mascara - 6.5/10<br />4. Around The Fur - 10/10<br />5. Rickets - 8.5/10<br />6. Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away) - 10/10<br />7. Lotion - 9/10<br />8. Dai The Flu - 10/10<br />9. Headup - 9/10<br />10. Mx - 10/10<br /><br />Overall: 92% A-<br /><br />I guess if you are a Deftones fan, liked the radio tracks or are into artsy rock like Tool and Filter this should be just what you're looking for. It may not be the best release by the band but it is still a really good one.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|VERY UNIQUE VOICE LOVED ALL THE TRACKS I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD
B00004Z400|5.0|This is the one; this is the Deftones release that really displayed what the band is capable of. This entire album is great from start all the way to finish. It was my second experience with the band almost a year after I had gotten \\"Around The Fur\\". At first I wasn't sure what to think because I did enjoy their last release but I didn't know anything from this album because they don't play them on the radio much. So I took the chance anyway and did the right thing. Each track is just so unique and artsy, I love it. It's also at my borderline of what I consider too hard because of the screaming. Chino's vocals blend so well with the music you don't even notice it and it doesn't get annoying like you would think. Probably my favorite tracks from the record are \\"Feiticeira\\", \\"Elite\\", \\"Passenger\\", and \\"Change\\". Anyway, here's what I think of everything else...<br /><br />1. Back To School (Mini Maggit) - 9/10<br /><br />2. Feiticeira - 10/10<br /><br />3. Digital Bath - 9.5/10<br /><br />4. Elite - 10/10<br /><br />5. RX Queen - 10/10<br /><br />6. Street Carp - 9.5/10<br /><br />7. Teenager - 8/10<br /><br />8. Knife Party - 9.5/10<br /><br />9. Korea - 9/10<br /><br />10. Passenger - 10/10<br /><br />11. Change (In The House Of Flies) - 10/10<br /><br />12. Pink Maggit - 9.5/10<br /><br />Overall: 95% A-<br /><br />I think this album just has so many awesome tracks. There aren't even any bad tracks on this record. Like on there last one there was 1 or 2 iffy tracks, but with this its just plain great. If you are a Filter fan or Tool fan you will probably enjoy this album. Especially if your a Tool fan because maynard makes his guest appearance on the track \\"Passenger\\".

B00005J6SZ|4.0|Madonna has never exactly been a critical darling, and Like A Virgin often catches the most flack from the opinionated masses. Through its two biggest singles her second album introduced both the idea of Madonna as \\"Boy Toy\\" and originating her virgin/[...] image.  However, discounting this effort as a simple paean to eighties culture or debating whether or not the popular music Reagan's first term in office was truly better than disco ignores Madonna's first fully realized piece of pop masterpiece, one of only two discs that were released free of the immense baggage that her image and reputation would soon provide.<br /><br />Both \\"Material Girl\\" and \\"Like A Virgin\\" were written for Madonna by outside songwriters, a practice she would forever escape starting with her next full-length effort.  Take these hits for what they are - a move just as calculated as Madonna's wardrobe. In fact, a team that was also writing for Cyndi Lauper, who was Madonna's prime competition at the time, penned one of the two.<br /><br />It was \\"Like A Virgin\\" that launched Madonna into the stratosphere after she performed it as a slutty wedding-day centerpiece on the MTV Music Video Awards, wisely escaping before the cake was cut only to wind up writhing around on the stage in a wedding dress and famous \\"boy toy\\" belt. However, the massive single that it often obscures is the much-less squeaky \\"Dress You Up,\\" whose delivery defuses accusations that Madonna wasn't much of a singer. Here she is desperate, insisting that she will dress you in her love at the top of her lungs.  You are inclined to believe her.<br /><br />Also, feel free to ignore the weird dancehall bounce and edgy synthesizers of \\"Material Girl,\\" which don't have much of an effect on the rest of the proceedings.  That massive hit all but erased the memory of the Madonna penned single \\"Angel,\\" which neatly takes all of the musical themes of her first album and moves them inexorably forward towards pop perfection with the help of Nile Rodgers hip production.  Despite the overpowering array of synthesizers brought to bare on this disc, there's something very real here: chirping guitars and the subtle under-harmony to Madonna's wisely under-delivered chorus are both details that make this a classic.<br /><br />Like A Virgin also offers the first two ballads of Madonna's career; the later-remixed turn on \\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" (a cover, which is rare for Mad), but also \\"Shoo Bee-Doo\\" -- the classy b-side to \\"Dress You Up.\\"  On this solo Madonna writing-credit we almost manage to lose the synthesizers entirely, and along the way pick up live piano and drums as well as the classic callback backing vocals that would go on to be a Madonna trademark on \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Vogue.\\"<br /><br />There are only three other songs on this short effort. \\"Over and Over\\" features frantic tic-tok percussion and is a perfect embodiment of pop, more-so than either of this album's infamous singles. \\"Pretender\\" is dramatically overwrought, but watching Madonna get worked into frenzy has never been boring.  And album closer \\"Stay\\" sounds genuine and bounces throughout, an easy bridge from underdeveloped fare to the more adult hits from the more acclaimed True Blue.<br /><br />Is there anything so horrible about this disc? If you still resent Madonna's international superstardom, then maybe yes.  However, when it comes to popular music from the eighties this is one of the absolute zeniths, and it also bears the mark of an important step in Madonna's unstoppable journey towards becoming the most famous woman on the planet. And, to top it all off, it's her best and most under-appreciated disc up through the masterpiece Like A Prayer.<br /><br />Really, when was the last time you listened to it?uction.

B000063JZQ|4.0|It is always refreshing to see new twists on Shakespeare as each generation of directors gives its take on the Master. While this adaptation drags near the ending and sometimes the dialogue is diffuclt to follow, for the most part this MACBETH works. Polanski has cast the Macbeths (Jon Finch and Francesca Annis) as younger than many directors do, has Lady Macbeth do her famous sleepwalking scene in the nude and portrays the coven of witches naked as well. Every critic has commented on the bloodiness of Polanski's version. There is blood everywhere; the death of Macbeth will make you gasp.<br /><br />All the scenes with the witches are quite wonderful. There is a naturalism about the filming that is particularly good. One gets the impression that these people do actually live like this and may not smell good at the end of the day. These just might be real people rather than actors who strut and fret upon a stage. Having the actors do their soliloquies as internal thoughts works much better than the usual artificiality of talking to an imaginary audience. Annis as Lady Macbeth gives a stellar performance as the ambitious force behind a sometimes reluctant husband.<br /><br />Polanski remains one of the great contemporary directors.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Let It Be ... Naked is an easy purchase to justify, as it's something that i've wanted to hear for almost my entire life:  Let It Be without Phil Spector.<br /><br />For those of you not of the Beatlemaniac persuasion, the short of the story is that The Beatles completed the studio work used on  Let It Be as a potential soundtrack to a groundbreaking live performance, but then shelved both the idea and the recordings. After Abbey Road was released, Spector was brought in to spruce up the comparatively unpolished studio takes for public consumption.<br /><br />Naked ditches the Phil Spector polish of orchestras and choirs, as well as the multiple spoken segments and the brief \\"Maggie Mae\\" and \\"Dig It,\\" while adding a warmly analog digital conversion and the classic rooftop version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" (a different take currently appears on Past Masters 2).<br /><br />Spector-rectification aside, the restoration of the basic tracks is subtle but remarkable; rooftop concert vocals are all crisper (notably on \\"Dig A Pony\\"), guitar tones sound truer across the board, and Paul's piano is more balanced on \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Winding Road.\\"<br /><br />The latter two songs also benefit the most from their remixing; \\"Road\\" is less periodic and more poignant without it's loping string section, and with the added bonus of hearing more of the excellent piano work from Paul. \\"Let It Be,\\" on which the excess was less obtrusive, holds together fine with the quartet of Beatles ahhing in harmony without a backing choir. \\"For You Blue\\" sounds worlds different with the benefit of precise stereo mixing and digital EQ. Also noticeably different is \\"Across The Universe,\\" never slated for Let It Be in the first place before Spector stepped in, sped up to its original key and stripped of the airy scales and runs that had cluttered it.<br /><br />Other revisions are less revelatory, though equally welcome. Aside from their vocals, \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"One After 909\\" have a perceptible added crispness, with the former losing much of its organ part -- a faithful but jarring choice.  \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" loses a touch of analog fuzziness but otherwise sounds the same.<br /><br />The changes are questionable on only two tracks. \\"Get Back\\" is mastered phenomenally, but it still ends without the refrain present on the Past Masters version -- a less objectionable choice on Naked with the song rightfully tracked in the opening slot. Original opener \\"Two Of Us\\" sounds like it's gained a slight boost to Paul's harmony, though it could just be the effect of a clearer mix. Though this choice is consistent with Paul's lead on the bridge section, the song is not as charmingly self-referential in this newly mastered version.<br /><br />Let It Be ... Naked is remastering done right -- it is a boon to the casual fan, and absolutely essential to the serious collector. It is of a higher caliber than the at-times slapdash  Anthology discs, and its omissions and inclusion are purposeful rather than arbitrary or sales-driven.  Most importantly, Naked presents a picture of what The Beatles actually sounded like at the end of their career, with production that favors the clarity of their performance rather than any commercial or personal gain.<br /><br />Other Beatles discs may be completely retracked or remastered in the future, but Let It Be ... Naked is surely the last truly essential Beatles release.dded crispness, with the former losing much of its organ part -- a faithful but jarring choice.  \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" loses a touch of analog fuzziness but otherwise sounds the same. <br /> <br />The changes are questionable on only two tracks. \\"Get Back\\" is mastered phenomenally, but it still ends without the refrain present on the Past Masters version -- a less objectionable choice on Naked with the song rightfully tracked in the opening slot.

B000EPR7NE|4.0|This is the musical score from the movie The DaVinci Code.  It is great score and has haunting melodies that go along with the action of the movie.  If you like to listen to the musical scores this is one you should add to your collection.
B00005JNNZ|2.0|Samuel L. Jackson seemed somewhat tame in this movie, yet still believable as a coach of a high school in a rough neighborhood. I thought it could have been a little shorter but the time but it's only 76 minutes. That's pretty short. If it was 90 to 120 minutes I guess I would have been as restless as a 6 year old at church. It's kind of dull. <br />
B000BNI90O|5.0|When I heard about the release of the complete recordings of Howard Shore's \\"The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Rings\\", I was so happy that it's quite impossible for me to describe my feelings as a soundtrack collector -ahem, a soundtrack freak, more like it.  I felt the same when the expanded edition of John Williams' \\"Superman-The Movie\\" was released back in 2000.<br /><br />I thought epic orchestral scores were vanishing from the map, but Howard Shore came along and wrote music for the most important film trilogy in years.  I mean, listening to the mysticism of the One Ring's theme, the innocence of the Hobbit's theme, the epic Fellowship theme.  What can anyone ask?<br /><br />The idea of the 180 minute piece on three CDs, as well as in one audio DVD, is definitely genius.  The packaging is extemely beautiful.  Gosh, I'm looking forward to the complete recordings of \\"The Two Towers\\" and \\"The Return Of The King\\".<br /><br />The only thing I regret about this album is the absence of 'The Prophecy' from the original release.  Granted, the final moments are heard on these complete recordings, but the rest of the track is nowhere to be heard.  Pity.<br /><br />But, in the end, this is still a true masterpiece.  Enjoying three hours of some of the best film music ever written is worth the price of this album.  And as Gollum would say: 'It's our preciouuuusss.'
B000AP04FG|4.0|My husband and I thought it was smart and sexy! Personally, I don't care about all the relationships that came out of this movie (or relationships that were broken). It's none of our business as movie watchers. There is a good chemistry between the two of them and that's what made this a better than average film.
B0000027D5|1.0|I've been a fan of Santana since the first album but Lotus bears little resemblance to what I expected.  I read the reviews and bought it based on that about 4/5 years ago.  I found most of this album to be annoying--some excellent playing but it goes nowhere.  The screeching guitar is just too much to take--almost like fingernails on a chalkboard. I can not imagine sitting down to listen to this again--When I bought it I felt that way but attributed it to maybe I just wasn't in the mood to listen.  So I put it away for a month and came back to it twice and feel the same way and my receptivity does not appear to be changing. The last listen was today and it's been a year since I've listened to it last.  I'm sorry--it's not happening for me.  He's still a great guitarist, but to me---this is noise!
B00080Z53O|5.0|It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It's about life, death and love. This film was based on a true story. It's about Ramon Sampedro who lived in Spain. He did not want to live as a quadriplegic and fought 30 years for his right to die. So many people wanted to identify him as a quadriplegic and his wishes the same as other quadriplegic. He wanted to be seen as an individual and his wishes as only his wishes. He was an active man who found life as an inactive person unbearable. He only spoke for himself. He was highly intelligent man and realized that every person has their own reason why they wanted to live or die. And he was only a spokesperson for himself. He believed in living his life rationally but in tune with his emotions. Yet he realized that other people lived and saw life differently and respected their differences. He just wanted others to understand his way of seeing life.  <br />
B000BB1MI2|3.0|Making a remake of 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' could easily be redundant and unnecessary.  Fortunately, with the high-tech wizardry and Johnny Depp's key performance, 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a rich, but darker ride.  Some of the same elements are there, and the development of the story is the same, but this time the atmosphere and the ending are much different.  Both versions have musical numbers, and the story is still basically Dante's 'Inferno' for children (with modern vices and punishments, such as excessive gum chewing or too much TV watching).  The choreography is as dazzling as the first film, but the music is updated enough to feature the Ooompah Loompahs performing rap, techno-pop, and heavy metal to deliver us sermons as well as sweeties.  The children's performances are cardboard caricatures in both movies, but Charlie is younger and maybe even more endearing this time around.  Otherwise, the tone of the factory scenes is much more ominous than the classic made nearly thirty-five years ago.   <br /> <br />The biggest difference is Johnny Depp.  He is deliberately tentative as the quirky and eccentric Willy Wonka.  His performance is admirable and androgenous, but it purposely leaves out a lot of the charm Gene Wilder provided for the role.  This Wonka seems sheltered and clueless. (Some of the flashback scenes tell more of the story, though.)  Charlie Bucket and family, however, make up for the charm deficit and provide some heart-warming surprises.  (Based on the Roald Dahl novel of the current title.)
B000002J2B|5.0|The last Genesis CD to be true to its story telling roots, with rich, detailed music laced with all the ingredients that made most people Genesis fans in the first place. From the opening attack of \\"11th Earl of Mar\\", to the closing \\"Unquiet Slumbers For the Sleepers/In That Quiet Earth/Afterglow\\", \\"Wind and Weathering\\" touches on many moods and inspirations that regretably will no longer be demonstrated on their future CDs, at least to this extent. \\"One For The Vine\\" is one of my favorite Genesis combinations of story telling and progressive musical demonstrations, carrying a variety of sounds and tempos. And \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" both musically and lyrically puts you into the dilemma that is being British, citing the contradictions that comes with life in England. \\"Your Own Special Way\\" garnered pop radio play attention, but whetted Genesis record sales appetites (Collins upcoming divorce, and subsequent solo efforts would solidify the Genesis pop sound to come). This album was still a rock aberrition in the bubble gum, hard rock saturated sounds of the mid 70s. But that's what made it worth a listen. With the exception of a few ditties from the following \\"And Then There Were Three\\" CD (titled after the departure of guitarist Steve Hackett and resulting remaining number of band members) and \\"Duke\\", no future Genesis album will ever have the same character. This CD made me a Genesis fan at a time when I appreciated where they came from, and could still see remnants of their past in future CDs.
0800177363|5.0|`Awakenings' is truly one of the most heartbreaking and heartwarming films I've ever had the experience to see.  Starring two brilliant actors, Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, `Awakenings' gives us a tragic true story that will open our minds and ours hearts for the full two-hour running time.  The story of Doctor Sayer's (Williams) as he tries to cure some 15 patients in his ward is sure to strike many a chord.  This film as been hailed by critics and has been loved by Oscar so why not everyone else. <br /> <br />The film opens with a young boy named Leonard.  Leonard is getting very sick, so sick he can't move his hands.  It's heartbreaking to watch him try and hide his sickness, placing his schoolbook under his desk so the teacher won't find out his disability (by seeing how messy his handwriting has become).  <br /> <br />Fast-forward to the year 1969 when Doctor Sayer is hired as the new neurologist at a chronic clinic.  Upon arriving and beginning his work he sees that these patients suffering from a disease that makes them immobile and unable to speak, may not be as incurable as the other staff believe.  Linking all the patients to post-encephalitis he decides to administer one patient, Leonard (De Niro) with L-Dopa, a drug used for Parkinson's patients, in an effort to reverse his crippling disorder.  Miraculously the medicine works and Leonard is able to move again for the first time in thirty years.  As the remaining patients are given the drug there is an air of false hope, hope that all is better. <br /> <br />As time passes Leonard falls in love for the first time with Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), a young woman who visits her father who has suffered a stroke.  The two of them form a bond that is touching to watch.  Time though also brings bad news.  The medicine doesn't seem to work passed a certain point and Leonard's condition is worsening.  He suffers from uncontrollable ticks and mood swings and it's apparent that what they deemed a miracle may indeed be the opposite. <br /> <br />This film shows us the value of life, the lives we all take for granted.  Listening to Leonard speak of how wonderful it is to be alive is truly inspiring, and watching a man with nothing but life to live get robbed of the chance is heartbreaking to say the least.  As Leonard learns he also teaches, helping Sayer's, a man who is repressed and reclusive, break out of his shell and understand that life is only life if you live it.  The second half of this film will take out your heart and tear it to shreds, and the fact that De Niro is so wonderful in this film doesn't help in the tearjerker department.  Falling in love with Leonard will only make the final frames worse, but it's unavoidable.  The film is done brilliantly, each frame adding layers to the films message and importance.  There's one scene in particular that really touched me.  The first time Leonard is outside since awakening we see him walking down the steps and it shows a close up view of his feet, and as he walks down we see a young child walkig up with her mother and it's clear the connection.  Subtle yet so touching. <br /> <br />One of the greatest films I've ever scene!  <br />
B000E6UK5K|2.0|When that fat old sun [Gilmour] in the sky is falling...  <br />Quite frankly, I expected more. My feeling is that David Gilmour really has nothing to say in this album. Not only the lyrics, but the music itself is mediocre. At most, maybe one or two tracks (\\"Take a Breath\\" and \\"This Heaven\\") are acceptable (by no means great!). I went back and listened again to \\"About Face\\" - it seems so much more interesting. Ditto for \\"A momentary Lapse of Reason\\" and \\"The Division Bell\\". I think these lyrics from \\"The Wall\\" are quite appropriate for Gilmour now: <br /> <br />     There must be some mistake <br />     I didnt mean to let them  <br />     Take away my soul. <br />     Am I too old, is it too late? <br /> <br />     Where has the feeling gone? <br />     Will I remember the songs? <br />     The show must go on. <br /> <br />I'm asking all the reviewers who rated this album highly: would you still buy it if it were released by a totally unknown artist? I wouldn't.
B000FVBLEI|5.0|Wow! this album caught me off guard! One of my friends referred this band to me, and I checked out their myspace page to hear the new single 'this calling.' I liked it and was convinced to buy the cd regardless of how good the rest of it might be.  When I picked it up though, I was blown away by how good every song is.  The guitarist use great technique.  The new drummer throws some wicked double bass drumming in there as well.  One thing to note is that this bassist is a GIRL!  Some people who have reviewed missed that, but no matter, everyone seems to like her.  This is an addictive metal album.  I havent been this addicted to a metal cd since Killswitch Engage's The end of Heartache. GO BUY THIS NOW!
B00004XONN|5.0|As I've listened to Radiohead's later works (such as Amnesiac and Hail to the Thief), I often had to listen to it many times before I truly liked and appreciated the music. But somehow, Kid A was not the case. The first track jumps out at you, and afterwards every track takes you on a journey across deserted lands, demolished cities, and ethereal places that seem like another world in itself. I believe Radiohead was telling a story with Kid A. Whatever that story might be can be very well interpreted by anyone and everyone. Just listen to the music, and a personal story will unfold. Not only that, but the artwork in the album cover sleeve is stunning and helps you visualize the theme of the album (just like Amnesiac, for instance, with its ancient civilzation theme). For some, Kid A might be an acquired taste. It's an electronic album, but it also has plenty of classic style sounds and catchy beats. I'll definitely buy this album and put it in my Radiohead collection, and appreciate the creativity of this album in the likes of OK Computer and The Bends.
0060555661|5.0|I just finished reading the latest, revised edition.  It has excellent annotations and commentary by Jason Zweig, incorpoating today's market conditions.  These annotations and commentary are sufficient to demostrate how the principles in this book are still valid today, after so many decades!
B000002NHN|5.0|Awesome!  Her best compilations.  Use constantly for meditation, drifting off to sleep, and love-making.  The combination of Celtic, Mediteranean, and Arabic instruments, themes, and melodies is sensational!  Have given copies to siblings, off-spring, and close friends as gifts.  All comment on their satisfaction.  A must have for personal music libraries!
B000EHRVP6|4.0|This is a great horror flick, but the first half hour of the film is stupid and pointless...like an american pie movie with more sex/nudity.  The latter half of the film however is amazing, and the ending is an absolute irony.  amazing secind half and amazing ending earn this 4 stars.
0446614459|3.0|I agree that the book grabs and holds your attention at the beginning, but Sean King and ex-girlfriend Joan's sarcasm was intolerable. They both should have an attitude adjustment! And jeez, King and Maxwell are clearly attracted to each other but spend weeks working together without as much as a hug ... are they human??? The plot is confusing with all the wild \\"whodunit\\" speculation from the four major characters. The ending was highly disappointing in that the villian had less than believable motive for such absurd crimes. I am a Baldacci fan and will read again, but the writer must have worn himself out on all the twists and turns and had to finish the last few chapters in his sleep.
B0000046JP|3.0|This piece, sadly, has been played to death.  Paco de Lucia gives a decent performance.  Those above who sing his praises should keep in mind that it's a concerto and a collaborative effort among the guitarist, a conductor, and the orchestra.  Also keep in mind that Paco's greatest asset is his nimble fingers.  Do you suppose he could get the whole concerto down to under 5 minutes?  Would you enjoy it if he did? <br /> <br />I was enchanted with this piece when I first heard it 40 years ago.  Nowadays I avoid listening to it.
1878424319|5.0|While The Four Agreements are simple, they are just as important for making life easier.  <br /> <br />I found the reading to be enjoyable and the agreements have helped me. This is the kind of book to refer back to, if anything, just to be reminded of them to make life nicer.
0060763280|5.0|Thank God for this book!  I did the exercises in this book and some amazing revelations came to me.  This is a must have book for anyone trying to increase their wealth potential!!
1592400876|1.0|I made the mistake of buying this book based on how well it was selling.  I struggled through it.  It's a small book and it took me forever to read.  This subject matter is not for everyone.  I learned some things about using punctuation but this book could have been a magazine article instead.  The point being made is stretched to fill an entire book.  I suggest reading a few pages before buying to make sure that this is your kind of subject.
B00000FC5H|5.0|I bought this CD about a year ago.  It is a dynamic, excellent collection of Earth, Wind & Fire's best songs.  They go from 1973 to 1981 with the hits and even included the heavily requested Reasons. When I first heard them in 1978, I thought that their 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976 hits were all new, all off of one new album.  But these songs from various years just showed me the massive impact they had in the '70s.  The live band, the emphasis on horns and a complete band playing music and tearing it up.  And funky songs like September, Serpentine Fire, Getaway, Boogie Wonderland and others. Maurice White's knew what he wanted out of this band and they're still doing it over 35 years later with live performances in 2006!   Although I miss Maurice in the band, Verdine White, Philip Bailey and this other fellow are keeping his dream alive.  Other favorites I like are Let's Groove, That's the Way of the World, the mellow After the Love has Gone and others.  They chose a good 17 for this collection, and while it's not the most perfect, it fully compiles their success of hits and well requested songs!
B0006Z2LH4|4.0|<br />There are two Truths about the Cube:  Everyone wakes up with the same questions (Who am I? and Why am I here?) and everyone dies in the Cube.  Some last longer than others, and some are killed by their fellow Cubists, but in the end the Cube always wins.  Everybody who enters the cube dies in it, and usually in horrifying ways.  Nobody gets out alive.  Ever.  Well, there might be one exception... <br /> <br />The Cube is a metaphore for Life, or the World, or Human Existance.  We're all here on earth with the same questions, and we all die in the end.  The key to the movie is at the exit scene:  \\"Do you believe in God?\\" - \\"What kind of God would do this to people?!?\\"  *bzzzt*  Wrong answer.  Burned alive in hell.  But what would happen if someone said yes?  Barbarash leaves this question unanswered and open to our own interpretations... <br /> <br />While I do not agree with Barbarash's conclusions and I'm really not into slasher/horror flicks I really did like this movie.  I don't think it'll ever be considered a great film by anyone, but I like movies that have deeper meanings (Donnie Darko or The Ninth Configuration) that are not readily apparent and this one took me a day to figure out.   Ultimately, Cube Zero is an inditement against God:  He either does not exist, or he's a sadist taking pleasure in tormenting people.  This is a common view, but just as far off base as those who think that God is nothing but Love - He is both Holy and Just AND Love and Mercy.  He is also not impressed that people simply 'believe in Him' or acknowledge His existance, but for the sake of the movie Barbarash's vision works. <br /> <br />Please note I did NOT see either Cube or Hypercube first, and I am reviewing this one as a standalone movie.  I will definitely check them out based on seeing this one, though. <br />
0812968255|4.0|Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is really a manual for living.  So much of what he teaches is very relevant for today.  \\"If you don't have a consistent goal in life, you can't live in a consistent way.\\"<br /><br />The book is actually a lot of short to the point lessons for living a better life.  \\"If you seek tranquillity, do less.\\"  \\"Which brings a double saftisfaction to do less, better.\\"  That is a philosophy that we all would do well to ponder and then employ.<br /><br />Another of my favorite bits of wisdom, \\"Not to assume it's impossible because you find it hard. But to recognize that if it's humanly possible, you can do it too.\\"<br /><br />Marcus Aurelius spends a lot of time on death and how to approach it.  Some of that is very good.  However he also spends a lot of time thinking about man's right and priviledge of deciding if and when to end live voluntary.<br /><br />There is an excellent though somewhat long introduction to the book.  Hays also provides a list of persons referred to in the book.  This is very helpful to at least know who Aurelius was talking about.<br /><br />I only rate the book four stars because I found The Emperior's Handbook by David Hicks easier to read and understand.  I recommend that everyone read at least one of the books by Marcus Aurelius.  If you can only read one, pick The Emperor's Handbook.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|I bought this album without hearing any of the songs, i read about them in a magazine. From the first listen i was hooked. they are one the most original and best bands out today
B000063V8T|5.0|One of the special thinks in the star trek saga is that one of them is for one generation: Capt. Kirk is for 50's to 60's generation; Capt. Jean Luc is for 70's to mid 80's generation, and so on.<br /><br />Star trek TNG, is specially good, because is the beginning of the special effects (as all we know now) on TV series, if you see the first season, the special effects are not so great, even more, is a continuous of the Capt. Kirk's series. But when the seasons become better, the special effects become better too.<br /><br />  In the Fifth season you will have the opportunity to see a great maturity in the characters; you'll see a Jean Luc, number one, a counselor, etc. more congruent, more chained in the series. In other words, you'll see not only special effects, you'll see better characters.<br /><br />  About the script, you'll see better scripts, with an actuality, with a perspective from the outer space, or from an advanced society. Finally, since the season four, the first chapter of the season is a second part of the season before last chapter. So it is possible that you can become an addict of this great TV series, and believe me, you are going to love it!
B000FVQYYK|5.0|there are a lot of people that do like this album and i cant understand why. Muse does not want to create absolution or origin all over again. so anyone expecting that will be dissapointed. however, this cd is great. The single Supermassive Blackhole has a different sound than the rest of the album. Starlight, Map of the Problematique, City of Delusion, and Hoodoo are all reasons to buy this cd.
0307276902|3.0|This book was disturbing, disjointed, and strange.  The writing style...lack of punctuation, paragraph, and any clear sense of organization...was interesting at first, but eventually grated my nerves.  However, even with the disjointed structure, I found myself wanting to read every page.  The characters were fascinating, and so was the look at the dichotomy of hopelessness and passion for survival recovering addicts must feel.  Many of the events seemed implausible as I was reading them, but, contrary to popular belief, the fact that I didn't believe them did NOT make me want to run out and burn all my nonfiction just incase it all wasn't exact and absolute fact.   <br /> <br />Okay, so maybe James Frey told some lies.  You're kidding yourself if you think this is the first time it's happened.  The problem, apparently, is that it happened to OPRAH.  And God forbid anything happen to Oprah.  I want to smack her off her ridiculously high pedestal and watch her plummet the nine thousand feet she has lifted herself above the rest of the world.  Her attack on James Frey was a disgrace.  I realize Mr. Frey screwed up, but her implication that he did it just for the money made me want to vomit.  Pot?  Kettle?  Black.   <br /> <br />I'd much rather see Oprah focus her attention on the liars and cheats who affect the lives of real people in the real world every day...politicians, insurance companies, the food and drug administration....just to name a few.   <br /> <br />The major loss to anyone who bought this book and believed it to be 100% fact, and was disappointed to find out it wasn't is the purchase price.  Big deal.
B000FVBLEI|2.0|There have been alot of highly anticipated releases in metal this year and still have more to come. This album was ranked in the top 5 that I was looking forward to along with Dragonforce, L.O.G., Trivium, and Slayer. I really liked and still listen to at least once a week, This Darkened Heart. It is an amazing album and was a complete surprise to me. So on July 11th I rushed to the cd store to buy this album and after a couple weeks of listening....all i can say is, eh.. Unlike their previous album...this has no character at all...the lone high point is the amazing drumming by their new female drummer. I think this is the case of a band just trying too hard. Mike and Oli are amazing guitarists and showcase a truckload of technicality on this album but nothing stands out. The solos, with the exception of a few, never seem to compliment the songs and always seem kinda lost with no real direction. There are a couple of songs i enjoyed such as \\"This Calling\\" and \\"Not Alone\\" had me banging my head...but lost interest in the rest of the songs.....I love KsE and while I don't wanna compare the two...when I buy an All That Remains album...I don't wanna hear KsE or S.F. or any other band...They were supposed to be the band that seperated themselves from the pack.

B000000H40|5.0|After Slowly We Rot Obituary was THE death metal band. Slowly We Rot was and is one of the most talked about death metal debuts ever, and with good reason, but after that tour Obituary lost two of its members, which was a huge blow to the band. Allen West leaveing was especially hard on the band because his guitar work was one of the reasons they stuck out amongst the other bands in the rising death metal genre. Luckily Scott Burns the producer knew of a recently out of work guitarist by the name of James Murphy. James Murphy at that time recently ousted from Death came in to replace Allen West as lead guitarist. Though the guitarists differ in their style, Murphy doesn't hurt the band at all, in fact this is one of Obituary's best albums. From Infected to Chopped In Half to Turned Inside Out(not to mention the redone Find The Arise and the Celtic Frost cover of Circle Of The Tyrants)this album never gets flacid. This is one album you will listen to over and over and never get bored. This album has become known as the James Murphy album, and trust me, thats not a bad thing. All in all worth your time and money, if you can find the remastered version by itself(which I believe this is) get it, stay away from those combo 2 in 1 versions. <br /> <br />If you like this album look up the classic Slowly We Rot debut. <br /> <br />Thank you for reading.
1594200823|5.0|This was a great book - very interesting and thought provoking.<br /><br />The premise was that Pollan wanted to eat different types of meals and find out exactly where the food came from. The first section is his meal at MacDonalds and then following the path of factory farmed animals and commodity corn. The second section was pasture-raised animals in which he profiled this amazing farm that tries to mimic the natural diets and styles of animals - really inspiring to hear about this farmer fighting against the goverment to raise his animals naturally, and then he creates a meal that he hunted and foraged for himself (though did I miss something - he baked bread and made pasta but didn't mention growing the wheat!).<br /><br />The book was well written and I think will encourage people to really think about where their food comes from.
B00005JNTX|5.0|It has been said many times before, but i'm gonna say it again. This is the coolest looking movie I have ever seen. Rodriguez did an amazing job directing this masterpiece of a movie. The visualizations look like they leaped right out of Frank Miller's books. This movie looks so amazing, I could watch it with the sound muted and still enjoy it. It is so appealing to the eye to see nothing but blacks, whites, and greys. Then to have the slightest color come into play sends your mind whirling. To see nothing but black and white and all of a sudden see green eyes or red lips is a pleasing surprise. If you move past the visuals, you get the fantasic acting by a great ensemble cast. Everyone gave unbelievable performances. The other thing that is awesome is the interweaving of three seperate stories into one seamless movie. All in all, I loved everything about this movie. From the opening scene to the credits, I couldn't take my eyes off of the TV. And if you like Tarantino, watch for a scene in which he directed.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I enjoyed the first movie in this series and thought it was very entertaining. This movie is also quite good.  <br /> <br />The story of Evolutions picks up right where the first film left off. There is great action early on, which eventually slows a bit for the purposes of the laying out of the storyline, but there is very solid action throughout.  <br /> <br />We get to see Marcus and William awoken from their hybernations. These are the two sons of Alexander Corvinus. Marcus was the first vampire and William was the first Lycan... This gets interesting... <br /> <br />The hybrid use of stuntwork and CGI comes together nicely for some bad@ss effects.  <br /> <br />Good action. Good storyline. Good effects. I recommend it.
B000EBEHR2|5.0|Brian Molko and his \\"two husbands\\" Steve Hewett and Stefan Olsdal have gone back to their roots for their newest release Meds and the results are spectacular. I've been a rabid fan of Placebo from the moment they released their first album.  <br /> <br />For Me, Meds ranks right alongside Without You I'm Nothing as their strongest album to date. I was actually somewhat disenchanted by Sleeping With Ghosts because it was such a \\"technical\\" album, a lot of keyboards, very electronic oriented and it actually has the fewest number of songs I like. <br /> <br />With Meds they are no longer hiding behind technology. It's much more raw, intense, focusing on the flesh and blood band, guitar, bass, drums. They've regained the passion and intensity that were the hallmark of their first albums and, along with that, they also possess the wisdom and maturity that comes with age and experience. <br /> <br />The themes Placebo have always focused on are still here for a very simple reason - because they are UNIVERSAL. It doesn't matter whether you are 15, 30 or 100, what color your skin is, what religion you are, what your sexual orientation is - these experiences, Love, Loss, Betrayal, Rage, Innocence Lost, Identity - they are in every single relationship you experience in life. Hell, I'm 30 and I still have plenty of days when I'm sitting here thinking - Why am I here?  <br /> <br />Meds is a strong album from start to finish. Songs greatly deserving of mention: <br /> <br />The first song Meds (a duet with VV of the Kills) starts off with Molko's guitar, tight, intense and then it only gets better, faster, never letting up, accelerating into a hellacious auditory free fall.  <br /> <br />Infra-red = Molko's at his sneering best in a wicked song about revenge, the lust to \\"crash and burn your beggar's banquet\\" - some one call an ambulance indeed. Molko sings the chorus to this song with so much spite and glee - it brings a smile to your face. You can't help but wish you had a front row seat to the spectacular train wreck Molko's orchestrating. Infra-red is definitely one of the strongest songs on this album.  <br /> <br />Follow the Cops Back Home is a beautiful song whose strength doesn't lie in any spectacular lyrics, but it the music itself. The whole soul of this song is neatly summed up in a single line \\"time to imbibe, here's to you, I'll tell you stories bruised and blue...\\" The music perfectly captures the mood of those evenings when you're sitting around with friends, enjoying one round after another, remembering good times, bad times. The music is simply haunting, nostalgic. <br /> <br />Broken Promise (a duet with Michael Stipe) captures all the sorrow, regret, rage and betrayal of infidelity. There are no cliches or trite lyrics here - No, ooh baby, darlin I'm so sorry / ooh I forgive you cuz I luv you. If you want that go listen to country music.  <br /> <br />The lyrics are brutally honest, the pain evident in Molko's voice as he sings, \\"I'll cry about this, and hide my cuckold eyes as you come off all concerned. I'll find no solace in your poor apology, in your regret which sounds absurd.\\"  <br /> <br />Pierrot the Clown - yeah, I know. When I saw that title I was more than a little dubious. I hate clowns so I was hoping like hell the song didn't suck. Not only does this song not suck - it contains some of the loveliest, most melancholy lyrics I've ever heard. The music is exquisite, enough to give you goose bumps, the song sorrowful enough to bring tears to your eyes.  <br /> <br />There is so much wistfulness and resignation in Molko's voice as he describes an abusive relationship. And the knife in the heart comes when you hear Molko singing, \\"When I dream, I dream of your lips. When I dream, I dream of your kiss. When I dream, I dream of your fists. Your fists. Your fists...\\" The music, and Molko's voice are heartbreaking - heartbreaking because he leaves you with the impression that he truly believes he deserves - thosefists.   <br /> <br />The remaining songs Drag, Space Monkey, Post Blue, One of a Kind, Blind, In the Cold Light of Morning, and Song to Say Goodbye are also perfectly crafted, and you can tell Placebo have put their hearts and souls into the music. The only song I can take or leave is Because I Want You. <br /> <br />As a Placebo fan I'm happy for the guys and proud of them because they've defied the odds once again - they've produced a fantastic album and after ten years my favorite little family \\"Daddy\\" Steve, \\"Mommy\\" Stefan and \\"Baby\\" Brian (as Stefan described them) are still together making beautiful music long after other groups have been consigned to the ash heap of history. <br /> <br />And I'm particularly pleased because Brian Molko is still here. There are plenty of people who believed he would be dead by now from a drug overdose or that he would have pulled a Cobain.  <br /> <br />I suspect that the few people who have criticized this album, or the band in general, are the same ones who have never forgiven Brian for cutting his hair and for cutting back on the amount of time he spent in dresses. All I can say to that is - quit yer bitchin! He's still beautiful and he still wears make up!  <br /> <br />Simply put, the guys rock, and this album is - without a doubt - one of the best of the entire year. If you don't get Meds - you need your head examined!   <br />
B0007GAERG|3.0|True Enough Mariah can sing(Not Nearly as good as she used to) but compared to most current singers she can but this album was not the \\"Major Come back\\" or album of 2005 as they try to make it out to be. It was highly anticipated which spiked the sales because everyone wanted to hear what Mariah had to say and think about it..who came out in 2005 that put out a solid product that could compete with the likes of Mariah Carey. Its a good cd i give her that, but in my opinion was one of the most over-rated cds of 2005
0553801503|4.0|I enoyed reading the book because I'm a fan of GRRM and this series, however this one just doesn't seem to be on par with the other three.   <br /> <br />The plot devlopment seems to come to a scretching halt until the end.  When I finished the book I got an irking feeling that this series would be going on much longer then I had expected.  It seemed like the characters that he wrote about ran around with little to no purpose.  I also had a hard time keeping up with all the names.  There are so many now and a lot of them are similar.  I actually had to look up some names in an online character database.  <br /> <br />I understand that this is really just half the book.    I'm anxiously awaiting the publication of the next book in hopes that  the series goes back on track.  Danny is one my favorite characters so I'll look forward to hearing more about her.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce definately did her thing in this cd, from all the tracks she spawned as singles to the album itself. The singles she released all were hot and she became if not the one of the hottest items of 2003/2004. From her sexy videos and dance moves to her incredible 3.2 Octave Mezzo-Soprano voice, Beyonce is it and will be around for a while.
1401302378|1.0|How many times per chapter do we have to read about Google, filters, democratization of distribution, and niches v. hits?  Does he really think he discovered something new here?  The only novelty I found was in an early chapter in which he explained that in the 50's and 60's one byproduct of the TV channels and the Top 40's was that they \\"synchronized\\" the US population in its tastes.    Then there are the gaffes.  Like when he writes that a jump from 6.4% to 12.1% is \\"almost a 50% increase\\".  I know I learned math before the internet, but that sounds like \\"almost doubling\\" to me.
B000EQ4G5K|2.0|If i could i would give this album 2.5 stars reason is because for a sophomore album for her, its not very good at all. In this album, Rihanna barely hits the Reggae genre but trys to show that she is also capiable of doing R&B. Some of tracks are somewhat boring and not too many i would really consider being \\"Club Bangers\\" unlike her debut album \\"Music Of The Sun\\" which had some nice cuts on it. But she is one to watch, she very pretty and has a somewhat nice voice, given time we will see what happens with Miss. Rihanna!!!
1932907009|5.0|Maybe you're like me: You've read all the screenwriting books you're \\"supposed\\" to read; you know the ones I'm talking about. And you have all this information swilling around in your brain about genre and character and structure ... yet none of it gels in a way that is remotely useful when it comes time to sit at the keyboard. You're missing some elusive something that will make it all fall into place, some secret alchemy that those successful ratbags know and are deliberately keeping from the rest of us. <br /> <br />That was me. Completely stalled, wracked in a frustrated limbo of knowing I have what it takes, but crippled and unable to move. In desperation, I finally decided to find a writer's group or a professional mentor, no matter what it cost. Then I read this book; and this book is both. And more. <br /> <br />Never has a book made such an immediate and profound impact on me. Any one of the sections would be worth the price in itself. The chapter on genre was the most brilliant and insightful I've ever read: after months of going around in circles trying to figure out whether the piece I was working on was a DramaCrimeActionComedy or not, I had almost given up on the concept altogether. Then I read Snyder's 10 \\"home-made\\" genres that group films not by their section in the video store, but by their stripped-down, broad story-type. It's a total paradigm-shift that's been beautifully honed to perfection. And it's just one of many sections that for me was the intellectual equivalent of taking off tight shoes. <br /> <br />I could go on, but I'm not going to. If you've ever wanted to have someone sit next to you while you write, someone who can finally give you the goods - not a dry academic or a smug industry-type but one of the alchemists who writes and sells spec scripts for a living - then for the love of Mike, buy this book. <br /> <br />It's subtitled, \\"The last book on screenwriting you'll ever need.\\" A bold statement, but for me, absolutely true. And Ihave a feeling that if I'd bought this one first, it would have been the ONLY one I'd have ever needed.
B0002CHIJW|3.0|This movie is short on plot and cinemtogaphy but strong on sexual violence and graphic nudity.  That pretty much sums it up.
0684824906|5.0|One would think, that after the mountains of books written about the American Civil War in general, and about Abraham Lincoln in particular, that there'd be little more to write. After all, the events she described took place only once. However, Doris Kearns Goodwin has come up with a fresh look at the Lincoln Administration. Few books before this -- e.g., Gore Vidal's fictional \\"Lincoln\\" -- told how Lincoln could turn a Cabinet full of rivals into near-apostles. <br /> <br />That is, of course, what the book jacket and the reviewers mention. The details she refreshes are worth a mention here as well; that's the charm of this book. When Lincoln had to get rid of an incompetent Secretary of War -- Simon Cameron -- we learn that Lincoln handled it so adroitly that Cameron himself was grateful to Lincoln when it was done. <br /> <br />We also see the other Cabinet members in more detail than usual. Books about Lincoln and his Cabinet tend to talk about the official lives, rather than personal backgrounds, of these people, and usually only during the war years. (Other than, sometimes, the soap opera with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase and his daughter Kate). Ms. Kearns Goodwin gives us rich detail about the lives and background of other Cabinet officers like Edward Bates and William H. Seward -- going back to the days when they and Lincoln were young lawyers competing for big cases. <br /> <br />Perhaps that explains some of the undertakings that Lincoln and his Secretaries got into, notably the incident where Lincoln, Chase and Stanton personally guided an amphibious landing near the rebel naval base at Norfolk, Va. in 1862. We also see how his young aides John Nicolay and John Hay were key to Lincoln's official and personal support during darker periods of the war. <br /> <br />The author also gives us a more nuanced look at Mary Todd Lincoln. She was part of the official White House and it is interesting to see a treatment of the First Lady that isn't simplistic-- too many take the public or anecdotal figure at face value and leave her looking like a harpy. The author has shown Mary Todd Lincoln to be a far more complex -- and somewhat unexpectedly sympathetic -- figure than we've been led to believe. <br /> <br />It's a lively and very human story, as Ms. Kearns Goodwin tells it, but it's also newly vivid Civil War reading for anybody who thought they had read it all.
B0000630BT|5.0|1990 was another great year for the world of heavy metal, \\"Razor's Edge\\", \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\", \\"Rust in Peace\\", and who could forget \\"Painkiller\\".  Alas, the last album Rob Halford would do with Judas Priest.  It wouldn't be until another 15 years that he would reunite with his former mates and produce \\"Angel of Retribution\\".  I must say that Halford left with one heck of a bang.  Painkiller is in my opinion Priest heaviest and fastest album to date.<br /><br />Throughout most of the mid 80s Priest was in a way, was put down a notch by bands such as Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, and Slayer.  Up until the debut of bands such as these nobody could touch Priest's speed and aggression, well maybe Iron Maiden comes close. But Judas Priest's albums got a bit more laid back.  Don't get me wrong, I do think \\"Turbo\\", and \\"Ram it Down\\" shred, but the release of \\"Painkiller\\" showed the bands of thrash that Priest weren't done yet.  This album turned a lot of heads.  It gave the reaction like \\"Wow, who the heck is this?\\"<br /><br />Listening to this whole album feels like one is on a motorcycle going 300 miles an hour.  All I can say is that my neck hurts for days after I've been head banging to this album.  The title track being the opener on the record lets the listener know what they're getting into.  There is just not any time to rest.  Tracks such as \\"All Guns Blazing\\", \\"Metal Meltdown\\", \\"Between the Hammer and the Anvil\\", and \\"Night Crawler\\" are relentless in pounding one's head into submission.  Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing's guitar work is top-notch just pure heavy metal greatness.  Rob Halford's vocals get so high that ears bleed and windows break.<br /><br />The only real shocker was that after the release of this phenomenal album Rob Halford would be leaving a couple of years later.  Maybe the band wasn't getting along very well at that time, but there was certainly great musical chemistry because there is the release of \\"Painkiller\\" to prove it.  Almost everything Halford and Judas Priest have released since \\"Painkiller\\" has been in my opinion very good. However, I have always yearned for return to the ferocity of \\"Painkiller\\".udas Priest have released since \\"Painkiller\\" has been in my opinion very good.

B000ASATWQ|5.0|It was in March that a friend of mine suggested I get this album.  Keep in mind, I had NEVER heard anything by any Marley aside from their father, Bob, so I was hesitant.  Ironically, I had heard of him through my estranged ex-boyfriend from Trinidad (who spoke NON-Stop about Damian) during the Halfway Tree Period.  Anyway, I bought the album without hearing ONE song before--a FIRST for me--and in three weeks, I owned this one, Halfway Tree and his first one, Mr. Marley (\\"Jr. Gong\\").  I was INCREDIBLY hooked!  So good, in fact, I went on myspace and became his \\"friend\\" in order to get the \\"411\\" about what goes on in Jamaica with him and his family..NOW, I love them ALL..!  Yes, talent IS genetic!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I have really enjoyed using this sweeper. I use it on the stairs and don't have to lug the heavy vacuum. I have found it to be effective on both human and dog hair.

B000EDWKXI|5.0|If you are looking for a purely entertaining light-hearted movie, this is an excellent choice.  The movie is fun, beautiful, and with an excellent cast.  Don't compare this movie to Felini's Casanova, but both are well worth seeing.  The story has very little to do with the historical Casanova, but so what?  Once you start watching, you are in for quite a ride!
B000001Y16|5.0|Man oh man, the is definetly a classic for the times.  I am a hip hop head and have been listening to rap since before many of my friends were kissing girls.  This Cd reigns at the top of my lists.  It is a fact that this is some of the most classic West coast material EVER.  All of Tupac's material is classic material and I have over 2 gigs of his music on my laptop and I never skip his songs.  Don't get it twisted, All Eyez on Me was a thugged out party ridah bumper, Me Against the World was the lonely and ambitious 2pac, but this Cd shows something the world never seen before. <br /> <br />First of all by changing his alias to Makaveli raises many questions.  He was bringing a new deepness and meaning to his music.  He was actually incorporating political messages and was calling all of his listeners to action to demand change. <br /> <br />Jada was right, if 2pac was still alive, even if Biggie was killed and 2pac lived, all these wack fools today in the rap game would be asking, You want fries with that?  Haha I love it because it is just too true.  Every track on this CD is a cut.  A majority of the songs have the absolute best beats I have ever heard, but 2pacs lyrical ability makes even the decent beat tracks classical rap material.  The early to mid 1990's was the golden era for rap and hip-hop.  This was brought to a terrible end by the killings of the 2 kings( we all know who).   <br /> <br />When I listen to this cd, I feel as though I am listening to a person who is alsmot super-human, which is why I refer to 2pac as a miracle of a man.  Only a thug of this stature could be brought to such an ugly end.  Go and see Ressurection and you will understand what I mean.  THIS CAT DID NOT KNOW HOW TO MAKE A BAD SONG.  Just remeber when you hear 2pac rapping and rhyming, you are listening to a higher power coming through human form.   <br /> <br />If this Cd came out instead of All Eyez on me when Pac was out of Prison, I would have sold even more than All Eyez,but that is just how the story had to go.  A book like the bible could be written on this man and his ideology. <br /> <br />But enough Ho Hum got out and get this damn thing!
0786868694|5.0|I am a Brit now living in the US. I love Nigella and all her recipes but to be honest it doesn't suprise me that most Americans dont. Overall American food is a complete mess (I mean - what IS 'Swiss' Cheese?? Plus Cheddar is a famous English cheese but seems to be used here to describe any yellow plastic stuff). Most american recipes use too many mis-matched ingredients & as for the cooking shows! Rachel Ray is supposed to be the best but frankly her recipes are a joke (for example she puts RED PEPPER FLAKES in Spaghetti Carbonara!). So overall if you're a yank just don't buy this book - all the recipes work plus Nigella is a purist (obviously not a good thing here!)
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I know that many people have complained about the 12C Platinum original. The updated Platinum was slightly more well received due to it's increase speed and undo function. However, there were still a few cosmetic complaints such as how the red function labels above keys looked faded against a silver back ground. Well this limited 25th anniversary version has the best of both worlds! It has all the updated functionality of the version 2 Platinum AND the better cosmetics of the original 12C. In fact I like the silver uppers much better than the original gold.<br /><br />Yes the buttons and the display are still like the new Platinum's but I don't think it's that big of a deal to have buttons and a display just like the original. It's close enough for government work as they say...<br /><br />Since these will only be available for a limited time I would suggest that everyone pick themselves up one even if you already own a 12C or regular Platinum. These will be sought after once they're gone. I'm sure that by this time next year we'll see eBay selling the 25th Anniversary ones for much more than what they're going for now.
B000FGGE68|2.0|I'm into sci-fi, action, special effects, comic books, and future society depictions.

0930289455|2.0|Alan Moore's Batman: a Killing Joke must have been a remarkable achievement in 1988 when it was first published.  Having owned several other comics of that year and beyond, I know that Killing Joke has some of the best and most exquisite artwork of that era, and would be top notch even today.  Also, the story is very brutal and frank, taking the readers to the limit of what must have been allowable back than.  Finally, compared to the sophomoric writing style of most comic writers, Alan Moore is clearly a notch above the rest - his talent shines especially in the dialogue between Batman and the Joker in the final 15 pages or so, which is peppered with smart, and sometimes brooding, wordchoices. <br /> <br />Having said all that, I think Killing Joke is ultimately pointless.  One can appreciate comic books in one of three broad ways - one can choose to be entertained by its action, one can enjoy the turning points of the storyline, or one can delve in further, and read it critically as one would a literary work of a more serious caliber.  But all three methods fail when it comes to a Killing Joke.  It does not have any significant action, except for Batman's one-way beatdown on the Joker, which certainly does not entertain anyone except maybe the bully in us.  There are no surprises or interesting twists to the storyline - Moore's re-interpretation of the Joker's inception is intended to be tragic and bring a new light to the man's character, but comes off as rather artificial and shallow.  The shooting of Gordon's daughter is hailed by the book's advocates as shocking and gripping, but beyond its obvious brutality it proves to be senseless violence that adds nothing to the story. <br /> <br />Than finally, there is the third method, which is not silly even for a peddler of comics like Alan Moore as he is the creator of such titans as \\"V for Vendetta\\" and \\"Watchmen.\\"  Indeed, in my opinion, Killing Joke works best as an extended analogy on the Joker's view of life -that any man is only a bad day away from insanity and despair.  However, the analogy fails to carry out in force due to the Joker's rather lame attempt to drive Gordon mad.  Beyond shooting Barbara, Joker really doesn't add much more to Gordon's misery.  Moreover, Joker seems to all but give up when Batman arrives to save the day.  For all his vaunted rep as the king of crime and lord of the diabolical, all Joker ends up doing is challenging Batman to a fistfight and end up trying to shhot Bats with a prop gun.  Due to all these weak outcomes, the analogy itself fails to carry out in any significant strength.  Of course, one can read it as Bats triumphing over evil once again, but than the story itself would have become much stronger had Bats beat Joker mentally and spiritually, as well as physically, which is afterall just as same as any other third rate comic. <br /> <br />No matter how you read it, Batman: Killing Joke fails to deliver the goods.  Of course, personally I think the whole Batman v Joker is rather played out, but there was/ is still room for interesting twists and drama between the two.  But we see little of such in this book.  It's a pity, since the artwork is so superb.
0345452585|5.0|Author Jonathan Kellerman is best known for his Alex Delaware series, but this one features another Psychologist named Dr. Jeremy Carrier. I like him. He's nothing like Alex. Jeremy is feeling kind of numb following the brutal murder of his girlfriend Jocelyn. Not only does he have to deal with the grief and shock of losing her, but he seems to be the prime suspect and the Police start hounding him when another body shows up. It's kind of funny because everyone seems to think he's such a calm, cool and collected guy when he's really broiling inside. He snaps and yells at a couple doctors and suddenly gets respect. He ignores his patients and they love him - apparently mistaking his apathy as some sort of Zen togetherness. He is basically sleepwalking through life until Dr. Arthur Chess, the Pathologist, enters the scene. He draws Jeremy out - with a sort of game. A game that turns deadly. Someone - Jeremy is pretty sure it's Arthur - is sending him strange, seemingly unrelated medical articles and news clippings. Eventually, he decides this has something to do with the murders and his curiosity gets the better of him and he starts digging, trying to put this puzzle together before another woman dies. Eventually, he is finally able to open up to another woman, but just when he starts to get domestic with Angela, he feels her life is being threatened by the killer too.<br /><br />Can he figure it out in time to save her? And can he survive a confrontation with the sadistic psychopath? Or will the police arrest him for crimes he didn't commit before he even gets the chance?<br /><br />It's a fast read and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
0441013074|5.0|_Century Rain_ by Alastair Reynolds is one of the most intriguing science fiction novels I have read in quite a while, one I would highly recommend to anyone. <br /> <br /> The first chapter of the book introduces the reader to two jazz musicians/private detectives by the names of Andre Custine and Wendell Floyd. They live and work (when work is available) in Paris, France in the year 1959. Having trouble getting gigs as musicians, still recovering from the loss of one of the members of their musical group (a woman by the name of Greta Auerbach, also a former lover of Floyd's), and not finding a lot of work as detectives, they feel very lucky to have an apartment landlord calling them with a possible case. One of the client's tenants had become a friend of his, a young American woman by the name of Susan White, and had died when she fell off of her balcony onto the pavement in front of her building. The police ruled it a suicide - perhaps not as keen to delve into the particulars in part because White was a foreigner - but Blanchard (the landlord) thought she was murdered. Reluctant at first, Floyd and Custine agree to take the case. <br /> <br /> The second chapter is still set in Paris but this about it as far as common threads go, at least at first. It is the year 2266 and we meet Verity Auger, an archaeologist probing some ruins, ruins that happen to be the entire city of Paris. Or make that the entire world. The planet Earth is completely uninhabitable by any organism, including bacteria, due to a conflagration that happened in the mid-21st century called the Nanocaust, an unspeakably horrid event in which billions of tiny (generally microscopic) machines that had been released into the atmosphere and waters to control a runaway climate (or later to control defective and malfunctioning earlier machines) suddenly digested every living thing on the Earth's surface, atmosphere, waters, and even underground. All of humanity in Auger's time resides in space; descendents of humans who were offworld at the time of the Nanocaust (as no one escaped from Earth). Auger lives in a vast, tremendously complex space station called Tanglewood, located in Earth orbit, and is a citizen of the United States of Near Earth. <br /> <br /> These two chapters, settings, characters, and backstories seem completely and utterly unconnected. I first wondered if Custine, Floyd, Blanchard, and the rest were in the past and if time travel was involved in some way. As the novel progressed though it became apparent, quite subtly at first, that Floyd's Paris is not the same Paris of Auger's past, that there were differences in the history of their respective worlds. At that point the reader would naturally conclude that Floyd lived in a parallel universe or alternate dimension of some sort. <br /> <br /> I really don't want to give too much away but neither time travel nor parallel universes are involved. Floyd's Paris and Auger's Paris (and their Earths) exist at the same time and in the same universe. Unfortunately for Floyd's world, they are completely unaware of Auger's world (or I should say solar system) and also there are a number of undercover operatives from Auger's world at work on what they dub Earth 2 or E2. Some are there for study and observation, but others have much more sinister motives. Will Floyd's detective work lead him to discover the existence of people from Auger's world? Can Auger's people operate on E2 and keep their existence a secret while stopping a nefarious plan that they uncover there? <br /> <br /> A very enjoyable book, the chapters set in Floyd's Paris felt very film noirish and had great atmosphere (and also Floyd was a great character). The nature of the mystery was very interesting, one that spanned centuries and worlds and that was resolved in an epic climax at the end of the novel. Auger's world was very interesting, an intriguing if somewhat depressing and apocalyptic extrapolation of the future of nanotechnology.The horrors of the Nanocaust was the not the last of such disasters and even in Auger's present time humanity is divided between her side, the United States of Near Earth (who are called in slang terms the \\"Threshers\\"), people who abhor nanotechnology, and the Federation of Polities (called the \\"Slashers\\"), people who live well away from Earth and who have fully embraced nanotech, mindful of the dangers but truly believing that they have mastered it and can safely reap the many benefits, becoming something more than human in the process. <br /> <br /> The book reached a pretty definitive conclusion as far as the main plot threads went, though a few aspects of Floyd's life (particularly involving Custine and Auerbach) were left unresolved. Also it is not completely clear that Floyd and others on E2 have seen the last of various operatives from Auger's world. If Reynolds were to revisit this setting in a sequel I would definitely be interested in reading it.    <br />
B00005JP3Y|4.0|The story itself is a rather interesting. A guy inherts his father shoe business. It needs a change in direction to keep going. So he  tries to save it by designing a range of shoes for transvestites. In the process, he hires a transvestite as a designer who becomes his friend and saviour. He becomes a *man* by taking charge of his fathers factory. He then loses his fiance by taking risks with his business and gains a new girlfriend.     The acting is quite good. The story is quite refreshingly new and there are a few laughs.
0783229526|5.0|For Jeff Shannon to slam this film in his Amazon Editorial Review just shows how ignorant and closed minded he really is.  Maybe \\"Steel Magnolias\\" and \\"War and Peace\\" are more to his liking.  Jeff, you are a joke.
B00005UEAR|5.0|If you want note-by-note reviews, read my fellow Amazon contributors. But if you are merely curious about \\"Six Degrees...\\", borrow disc 2 and play tracks #3 and #4, \\"The War Inside My Head\\" and \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" which run seamlessly together. And turn it up, loud.<br /><br />If you can wrap your inner critic's word skills around those moments of rock perfection, come back and write a fitting review. But, you likely won't find proper hyperbole to describe the music.<br /><br />Dream Theater is a gift from God to fans like us, and a wonderful frustration when trying to convey the pleasure of the listening experience. I absolutely love this band, and especially this CD... it does not get any better than \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbluence.\\"
0743454537|5.0|Right from the get go, you are sucked into this book. Picoult has created a fascinating, thought provoking work about a girl who was conceived in test tube for the purpose of being a donor to her sister who is suffering from leukemia.  The story is told from all the main characters (broken down by chapter) with the interesting exception of Kate, the sick sister, who we don't hear from until the end of the book.  While many reviewers don't care for the twists and turns this book takes, I think that they are an integral part of the story. When you have a problem with two solutions, neither of which are right, you cannot have a happy ending.  While this book doesn't provide for a happy ending, it does provide closure and a resolution that the reader can live with.  It goes to show how precious our loved ones are and how we must never take them for granted.<br /><br />This book is an excellent read and a great book for facilitating all sorts of interesting, intriguing discussion regarding medical and family ethics.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|The maturation of Mark Knopfler's style - both as songwriter and musician - is immediately apparent in this 4th album, as the haunting early notes cruise in quietly behind a faux roll of thunder. He was experimenting on this album a little with gimmicks - sound effects - not used on other works; in fact, \\"Love Over Gold\\" rather stands by itself in the lineup of Dire Straits. None of the others catch the tone of this one; it also has the fewest songs (although two of the longest). My personal all-time favourite piece - and the favourite of many others I've talked with - is the first song here, \\"Telegraph Road\\", a full exploration in how well MK can spin a story. It is always the song I pick to listen to when coming back to the place I consider home, and which I only get to see about once every 5 years now. There's not just one good guitar solo here - there are several. \\"Private Investigations\\", which follows, is a dark, sad treatise on the work of the lonely detective - or not; I keep reading that's what it's about, but somehow I keep waving aside smoke screens too. \\"Industrial Disease\\" is the one totally upbeat song, if you can call a snide swipe at industrializaton and fast-paced living upbeat; it's still a fun song. \\"Love Over Gold\\" is slow and moody, melodic but sadly observant; it's a good companion piece to the last song, \\"It Never Rains\\", which opens with a neat organ intro and ends up saying to someone in his past what I've been wanting to say to a few people for years - including one person who didn't like Dire Straits when I played any (perhaps too close to recognizable for them). If I had to pick a favourite Dire Straits album, \\"Love Over Gold\\" would have to be considered - and should be in any fan's collection.
B000055ZP8|3.0|Comedienne Molly Shannon recreates her Saturday Night Live character, Mary Katherine Gallagher, the gawky catholic school girl, for the big screen. At times, the film is very funny. Unfortunately, it is not very funny as often as one would like. What works great as a five minute skit on Saturday Night Live does not necessarily make for a great full length, feature film, even though quite a few of the Saturday Night Live regulars have parts in it.<br /><br />The film revolves around Mary Katherine Gallagher and her attempts to fit in and make the most popular boy in the school want her the way she wants him. She also wants to be a superstar in the worst way, even though her grandmother with whom she lives wants her to become a business woman. She does get her big break, however, when her school has a talent contest.<br /><br />Some of the funniest scenes in the movie occur when Mary Katherine, absorbed in her romantic fantasies and impervious to her surroundings, has a one sided conversation with an apparent fantasy lover for whom she substitutes a tree as a stand in. At times, she even acts out her romantic fantasy with the tree. Imagine it with a nun standing in the background observing Mary Katherine. It is hilarious. Unfortunately, those moments are few and far between. Still, if you are a Mary Katherine Gallagher fan, you will enjoy the film. If not, you may be disappointed.
B000J4QWMC|1.0|I realize that when a remake is made from a television series (or a movie) there is some element of creative liberties.  This can be a good thing or a bad thing.  Many people will report that this new rendition is either too much like the original or such an insult to the original it is heresy.  I have to be honest I am not really thrilled about taking old television shows and remaking them.  This type of exercise demonstrates that Hollywood is really running low on the idea tank for new films.<br /><br />I mean how many more retro TV shows are going to be made into blockbuster movies? Here are the obituaries of classic TV shows that (I feel) were butchered as movies.<br /><br />* Bewitched<br />* The Dukes of Hazard<br />* Fat Albert<br />* Charlie's Angels (and there was a sequel)<br />* Scooby Doo (and \\"sigh\\" there was a sequel)<br />* Starsky & Hutch<br /><br />This is just to list a few, yet I know I am forgetting a couple.<br /><br />So here we have the remake of \\"Miami Vice\\" (2006) and this DVD features an unrated director's cut.  I didn't see this movie in the theater so I have no idea what was added to the D-Cut.  I must admit I didn't have the highest expectations going into this movie.  However, I found myself really enjoying the first 20 to 30 minutes.  Then the movie really went down the toilet.<br /><br />Jamie Foxx is an excellent actor, being able to pull off action, drama and comedy beautifully.  Nevertheless, Jamie Foxx is wasted in this movie.  Anything I have seen Colin Farrell in has been a disappointment; S.W.A.T. keeps coming to my mind.  (Hold on, wasn't that an old TV series too? I believe it was and the movie sucked.)  However I have to give Farrell credit, his American accent in this movie was amazing.  He did a hell of a job.  In contrast, I don't know what he was trying to do with the mustache in this movie.<br /><br />As for the chemistry between Foxx and Farrell, I didn't think it was there.  After all this was the heart of the \\"Miami Vice\\".  The interaction between Sonny (Don Johnson) and Rico (Philip Michael Thomas) was great.  Watching this movie it is painfully apparent that the \\"new\\" Sonny (Colin Farrell) and Rico (Jamie Foxx) have a transparent relationship when in juxtaposition to their predecessors.<br /><br />Now this movie is called \\"Miami Vice\\" right? So with this type of title one would be lead to the conclusion that the movie would take place in Miami.  Not so much.  Most of the movie takes place out of the United States, South America and/or Cuba or other unknown places; I must admit the cinematography was beautiful.  Consequently this isn't a National Geographic special, it is an action movie.  Where was I? Oh, Sonny and Rico go undercover after being brought in by the FBI and/or CIA to deal with heavy duty drug dealers.  I still find it dubious that two Miami police officers would be brought into an international drug/customs affair.  In retrospect this plot element can be almost forgiven.<br /><br />This movie lacks any real action or suspense.  \\"Miami Vice\\" (unrated director's cut) clocks at about two and a half hours long.  In this given timeframe there are only two real action sequences, sorry racing boats don't count in my opinion.  This format really produces a very sloppy and clumsy paced movie.  Not to mention there is an unnecessary love interest for Sonny.  Sonny's sordid love interest is \\"the bad guy's girl\\" and seems moot, not to mention it takes a lot of screen time away from Rico. There was also a scene with a residential trailer and shoddy CGI, I just laughed. I digress to the first 20 to 30 minutes of regulation of this film.  The pace was good, Sonny and Rico were working together, there was a bit of suspense and THEY WERE IN MIAMI!!!!<br /><br />While I wasn't expecting the \\"white suites\\", peachy music and pseudo 80s cheese that made the television show great.  I was expecting a new twist on Miami Vice, yet still keeping the integrity of the original.  This moviehad the potential to have this \\"new twist\\".  The version of this \\"Miami Vice\\" was gritty and dark, giving the film a more modern feel.  This is good because Miami in 2006 is different than it was in the1980s. Sadly after the first thirty minutes this movie just ran out of gas.<br /><br />In conclusion, this movie might have been good if it wasn't called \\"Miami Vice\\", or if the movie had more action, or more interaction with the two leads, or if Colin lost the mustache.  This movie just left a bad taste in my mouth.  With regards to retro television show being remade as movies, \\"The Land of the Lost\\" (a favorite TV show of mine) is being remade and released this summer.  I feel the forecast for this film will be disaster.ty and dark, giving the film a more modern feel.  This is good because Miami in 2006 is different than it was in the1980s.

B000FQJAIW|2.0|i've bought these movies over and over again, too, like a lot of (no, most of) the reviewers above and below.  and i too am pissed off that they're coming out again despite the public's assurance that each \\"last time\\" release will really be the last time.  (is that just our belief, by the way, or is lucas and co actively promoting that idea?  there's a michael moore film here somewhere.)  anyway, lucas is marketing our affection for these movies, not just the movies themselves. <br /> <br />but garg!  i want these old versions on dvd!  and i'm weak.  i like my copies of the extended/special/tweaked trilogy, but the originals are worth having too.  so i honestly don't know if i'll really hold out or not, but i think (maybe) i'm going to wait for the releases these films truly merit, and which lucas will eventually create if he makes it to--oh, maybe the films' 50th anniversary.  well, ok, maybe it won't need to wait that long, but here's what would be a good start to an honest release of the original 3 films.  and i have to believe that lucas and co know this and have it a few/many years up their sleeves.  and i would buy my proposed versions on their release date, even if i was behind on the mortgage, and i'm sure the rest of you reviewers (and lucas and co) have plenty of other ideas you could add.  here we go. <br /> <br />each film would come in a 2 or (more likely) 3 disc set including <br /> <br />--the original, untouched versions of the films, including even the original fox searchlight opening. <br />--the most incredible image transfer possible, in whatever disc and tv screen formats are available at that time <br />--careful, excellent original sound transfer, in various audio formats <br />--commentaries plural, not just one commentary split among too many key players.  one for the director, one for actors, one for effects/sound/editing... <br />--trailers and sheets <br />--for episode 4, a full cd-rom version of all of lucas's original script ideas, thestuff no studio was interested in, the stuff he thought up before he ever tried to bring it to the studios, all the arcane terminology and plot elements/characters/planets we saw and the ones we never knew he had imagined, the ones he abandoned, the ones he wanted but couldn't do....all of it. <br />--for the sequels, a full accounting of lucas's original ideas, the studio's ideas, what was cut, what added, what was floated but abandoned... <br />--a special feature on conceptual artwork, lucas's first vision of the movies' environments, machinery, gear, clothing versus final vision, rejected/evolving artwork, etc <br />--extensive storyboards, including things that made it into the film, things that didn't, things floated but abandoned--and done like the recent criterion editions of kurosawa films, which appear as movie presentations. <br />--every available deleted scene, period.  do it as a branching dvd option, or a set of unconnected scenes, but show us.  no more lingering rumors.  get it all out. <br />--much fuller presentations of the special effects process, including the features available on the first laserdisc sets, which seem to have a much more extended offering of that, including the trial scenes shot with x-wings hand-held on wands to rough-in what the death-star finale would look like.  pursue the effects exploration right into how the final visuals were created, and be thorough. <br />--the 2 1/2 hour 4th-disc making-of documentary that came with the trilogy dvds is really excellent.  so now do 2 1/2 hours on each film.  a good documentary could avoid overlapping the stuff above except for a few necessary minutes total.  cover casting (who was chosen, who not, screen tests, etc), influence on culture, box-office, satires, hitches, on-set footage, planning, filming, etc. <br /> <br />lucas and co, you know this stuff better than we do, which is why we keep buying the same movies over and over.  just do a once-and-for-all definitive edition, and i'mon board.  but do it earnestly, in a way that comes as close to clearing the rumors and archives as absolutely possible.  don't make it necessary to have 6 iterations in our libraries to get a complete picture.  if you want to make more money, make more films.  if episodes 7-9 never existed, as you've been recently insisting, well hell, make them up anyway and have at it.  but please, no more half-hearted, faucet-drip dvd releases of what your movies and your fans really deserve.   <br /> <br />because even if i/we fall for these september 2006 releases, your legacy is becoming one of marketing instead of filmmaking--not more than, but instead of. <br /> <br />until the real deal comes out, i own the final vhs widescreen release of the original films (complete with the seizure-inducing visible copy-protection oscillating screen!), so maybe i can wait until 2027, especially when ridley scott is going to be keeping me busy with 3 editions of a dvd blade runner. <br />
B0007VCZ50|4.0|This is a documentary movie and the notes in the back of the DVD say it all. In 1985, after quitting a highly well succeeded pop outfit, The Police, a band that really managed to merge reggae and rock without plastering any style, Sting, a former jugg-band and of course jazz musician, sought how to expand the boundaries of his compositions, this an item that suffered restrictions within that band. For that, during the period of his first solo work was being done (\\"The dream of the blue turtles\\" album), Sting gathered in Paris one of the finest collection ever of musicians, all black and all of a jazz background, horn man Branford Marsalis, keyboardist Kenny Kirkland, drummer Omar Hakim, bass player Darryl Jones (now a Rolling Stone) and singers Janice Pendarvis and Dolette McDonald. \\"Bring on the night\\" focus on the birth of not only a new band and a new perspective in music (represented too by Trudy Styler giving birth at one of hers and Sting's children) showing without criticism or apology statements from Sting (where some of his insecure is evident), band members (a clever one by Marsalis) and the tense manager Miles Copeland, all well structured by director Michael Apted in a comprehensive, didactic way. Rehearsals in a stupendous castle together with some smart cuts joining creation and stage performances are worth the price of this movie although too short for concert fans and today patterns of footage. Police material is shown just in fragments and performance centered in new songs, as \\"Shadows in the rain\\", \\"Consider me gone\\", \\"Fortress around your heart\\" and \\"We work the black seam\\" - with a wonderful solo by Marsalis - and all are breath taking. As a bonus, views of Paris are always refreshments, and the wonderful quality of the picture must be praised, as well as the carefully mastered sound. A must for music fans of all kinds.
B000E8QVWY|4.0|Joaquin Phoenix was brilliant. Reese, a darling.  I loved it.
B0000TB05A|3.0|Let me back up a little and get back to basics.  I'm not going to talk about camera shots or other concerts.<br /><br />U2 is one band in which every musician matters a lot.  I don't think of Bono as the leader of U2.  I think of his voice as just one of the instruments.  Actually I guess I'd make the lead guitarist Edge my favorite member of the band.  I think it's his work that distinguishes U2 from the rest and gives greatness to some of their songs.  In that respect it's like Van Halen.  There is a charismatic and famous lead singer, but without that lead guitar you wouldn't have a great band, and the lead guitar contributes more to my enjoyment of the songs than the singer.<br /><br />One reason is that Bono sings well in his limited range, but he isn't a crooner like Elvis or Cyndi Lauper.  His voice doesn't do anything special.  It's not that he hits a large range of notes with power and accuracy.  It's not that his voice has a musical quality.  It does not.  He communicates a song, but his vocal instrument is ordinary.  In that respect he resembles Sinatra, one of his favorites.  If you want those high notes and those low notes, listen to Elvis, not to Sinatra.  Or, god forbid, listen to Bing Crosby.  He had an instrument.<br /><br />What I like best about U2 is the repetitive, hypnotic lead guitar that just keeps at you, like in Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.  It reminds me of bagpipes, not that I can stomach bagpipes for long.  Edge seems to be saying \\"I'll play this damn riff til you're sick of it, and I'll keep playing it til you are hypnotized by it, and I'll keep playing it until you are addicted to it like heroine.\\"<br /><br />There are four outstanding U2 songs for me.  One of them is in the body of the concert - Where The Streets Have No Name.  Two of them are in the encores - One, and With Or Without You.  Finally there's Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.  You won't hear that last one on this show.  Those four songs represent U2 to me, and without those four songs I wouldn't think the band was anything special.  With them, we have one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all time.<br /><br />At one point Bono was so affectionate with Edge that I wondered if he was making a homosexual statement.  Bono kissed him and seemed to be simulating sex with him in a symbolic way.  I thought \\"whatever, when you're a big star you can do any crazy stuff you want\\".  I think it is pretty evident that this was Bono's way of making a political statement about homosexuality.  He wasn't expressing his sexual desire for Edge.  They've known each other too long for that.  If they are lovers, they have to be like an old married couple by now, meaning sex once every few years.  So the show was for our benefit, to make a point that homosexuality is something that needs to be accepted.<br /><br />Bono got political and said that compromise is not a dirty word and that he never wants to return to the days of IRA rebellion.  That was during Sunday Bloody Sunday.  It's not \\"rock star cool\\" to have a brain.  Rock stars are supposed to be moron head bangers yelling about sex and violence, being so tough, so macho, so stupid.  Doesn't Bono know he's supposed to be stupid?  Stupid is cool, no?  Bono seems to have trouble being stupid.  Yet he's popular all the same.  Imagine that.ngs I wouldn't think the band was anything special.

B000E6EH1S|3.0|Colin Davis returned to the Symphonie fantastique as regularly as the swallows to Capistrano, with three versions on Philips alone. This is his second and best-played one. The sound used to be problematic but is now first rate, and that enables us to appreicate the Concertgebouw's gorgeous playing. They are so ravishing that it's too bad Davis is so cautious and at times outright dull.<br /><br />The Amazon reviewer indulges in special pleading to call this performance Apollonian or classical--it's just plain. The first two movements are the best, but as the tension and weirdness mount in the Maarch to the Scaffold and Witches' Sabbath, Davis loses steam. If you like an orotund, richly voiced Fantastique, however, here it is.
0618477942|5.0|FUN HOME A FAMILY TRAGICOMIC is the latest work from the highly skilled, insightful, neurotic and wry-humored pen of Alison Bechdel, best known for her \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" comic strip.  (One of the longest-running queer comic strips,  \\"Dykes to Watch Out For\\" is over 20 years old, has been syndicated in hundreds of papers, released in over 10 books, and is available online via the author's website.)  FUN HOME is Bechdel's graphically rendered account of growing up in rural Pennsylvania in the 1960s and 70s with a particular focus on influences of her father`s life and death.<br /><br />Beginning with some of Bechdel's earliest memories of her father, readers meet a man who was an intelligent, emotionally distant yet volatile, narcissistic perfectionist who struggled with secrets. Trapped in the town not only of his youth but that of his ancestors for several generations, Bechdel`s father worked in the family business, a funeral home (known in the family as the \\"Fun Home\\") established by her great-grandfather in the 19th century. In addition to his interest in local history and historic preservation, Bechdel's father was a closeted gay (or bisexual) man who had a string of affairs, primarily with younger men, throughout his life.<br /><br />Divided into seven chapters, each of which deals with particular themes in her childhood, FUN HOME contains a strong emphasis on literary references. Chapters weave back and forth in time, revealing aspects of Bechdel's childhood and details of her father's death. Books and literature were an important influence in Bechdel's life growing up. Her father taught English Literature at the local high school while her mother studied theater and performed in community plays. The gothic revival home the family lived in (and which her father had restored) boasted a library. At one point Bechdel admits, \\"I employ these [literary] allusions ... not only as descriptive devices, but because my parents are most real to me in fictional terms\\" (66). It becomes apparent that literary discussion was one of the primary modes of communication between herself and her father.<br /><br />Bechdel came out to her parents via a letter in the spring of 1980. Her declaration prompted her mother to point out to Bechdel that her father had been having affairs with men for years. Initially, this information appears to have been news to Bechdel, who reflects, \\"I'd been upstaged, demoted from protagonist in my own drama to comic relief in my parents' tragedy\\" (58). This \\"upstaging\\" is revealed as a theme in Bechdel's life as childhood milestones, such as her menarche, were overshadowed by the family preoccupation with and response to her father facing charges of \\"contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\\" Apparently, her father's closet was not entirely secret and his extramarital activities added strain to the family. Her coming out was further upstaged when her father died in a questionable \\"accident\\" (it may have been suicide) just four months after her letter.<br /><br />Bechdel spent years feeling shut down yet very guilty regarding her coming out and how it may have influenced her father's death. FUN HOME details the results of Bechdel's intellectual and emotional processing of her father's death, and her relationship with this complex, intelligent, conflicted, and often remote man. A powerful example of her self awareness includes her admission, \\"[evidence that he was considering suicide months before Bechdel came out] would only confirm that his death was not my fault. That, in fact, it had nothing to do with me at all. And I'm reluctant to let go of that last, tenuous bond\\" (86).<br /><br />Book-length graphic stories are not a mainstay of this reviewer's reading. However, Bechdel's clean, distinctive illustration style with its wry observations and amusing details is fun to read and examine, and drew this reader into her story quickly. Indeed, it's regrettable that this review can only include quotations and not excerpts of Bechdel's drawings. Several delightful and revealing images are included, such as her grandmother chasing a \\"piss-ant,\\" her early identification with Wednesday Addams, the summer of the locusts, her teenaged diary entries, and several aspects of her own adolescent self-discoveries. One cannot help but identify with Bechdel. However, despite the pain and struggle Bechdel has had facing her father's life and death, the book is neither morose nor depressing. The author has found peace with herself in regard to her father, her childhood, and who she is today. As she says in the dedication (to her mother and brothers) \\" We did have a lot of fun, in spite of everything.\\"<br /><br />FUN HOME is a wonderful graphic memoir that is engaging, heartrending, funny, and thoughtful.

As she says in the dedication (to her mother and brothers) \\" We did have a lot of fun, in spite of everything.\\"  <br /> <br />FUN HOME is a wonderful graphic memoir that is engaging, heartrending, funny, and thoughtful. Readers will definitely want to stop by the Fun Home for this viewing.  <br /> <br />
0099450259|5.0|I really liked that it was 'Christopher's book' we were reading.  It made me view things I do naturally as part of social communication, such as laughing to put someone at ease, in a totally different way.  Actions like that or touching someone in a friendly manner has a completely different effect on Christopher.<br /><br />Christopher is a really likable character and you can sympathise with his confusion in this mixed up, top speed world we live in and understand his actions totally, yet at the same time we could understand the thoughts and reactions that strangers showed.<br /><br />He's such a thinker too and I loved his thoughts on metaphors being lies \\"...a pig is not like a day and people do not have skeletons in their cupboards.\\"  and different facial expressions and how they can mean so many different things...I found myself trying them out! :D<br /><br />Although I don't have a family member with Asperger's,  I do have a brother who is special like Christopher and I could certainly relate to the need for organisation and routine in his life and there were many points in the book that made me smile.<br /><br />Haddon helps us view situations from all points of view and it was refreshing.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|As hard as it may be to believe, this film \\"Constantine\\" was remarkably <br />cool, despite the lead of Keanu Reeves, a man infamous for his crummy <br />acting. (I have to say, I like Keanu Reeves, even if he acts poorly at <br />times. It's fun to watch him. C'mon. Point Break...The Matrix......now <br />this? You gotta admit, he can catch your eye.) Anyway, I was so <br />impressed by \\"Constantine\\" and I myself find that hard to believe. Even <br />my boyfriend who had no expectations at all for the film was so amazed <br />that he said he'll probably purchase the thing when it gets released on <br />DVD. This is a major thing for someone like him to confess. It's hard <br />as hell (no pun intended) to get this guy to truly like a film. That <br />tells me something. I myself, probably would get the film too. It was <br />gripping, it was intense; I loved the visual effects. Like, it even <br />really got me thinking about my own soul and where it would end up. <br /> <br />\\"Constantine\\" is a gripping tale about hell's minions, heaven's <br />heralds, and the people on Earth's role in the middle of it all. Trust <br />me. If you like action and don't mind putting yourself through a whirl, <br />go ahead, see a movie that may not change your life, but will change <br />your tendency to judge a book by its cover and Keanu Reeves by his <br />resume.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I was totally blown away when I saw this movie. This movie emotionally grabbed me. I spent days with my head filled with the melodies such as \\"Music of the Night\\", \\"Angel of Music\\", and \\"That's All I Ask of You\\". I couldn't shake it off. Sometimes it is Christine's voice; sometimes it is the phantom's voice. Rarely have I found myself so completely absorbed in a movie. This is the only movie in recent years that I have watched more than 5 times. I have also read the movie libretto more than 3 times in order to thoroughly understand the storyline. The better I understand the story, the more I like it.  <br />If I could, I would give 10 stars to this movie. I haven't watched the stage play yet and after watching this movie, I plan to. But I really don't think I will like the stage version more than the movie. Allow me to tell you why I think this movie is outstanding. <br />(1) The story: I am totally obsessed with the love triangle in this story. It's so powerful that it emotionally hit me. I felt deep compassionate for the phantom. While he was a genies, his musical talent was totally ignored just because he was deformed. He secretly dreamed of beauty, and loved a young woman named Christine; he couldn't win her love no matter what he did because he had that loathsome face. Anybody could feel his pain when he told Christine that he secretly yearned for heaven. Let me briefly recite the story. It started with a young and beautiful chorus girl named Christine who has been taught by a mysterious tutor - the phantom. The phantom was a great musician but hid under the opera house because he was a freak of nature. After Christine's tremendously successful debut performance, the Phantom fell in love with her. He also, however, felt threatened by Christine's new suitor Raoul, a nobleman who was Christine's childhood sweetheart. So he invited her to his underground lair. The phantom mesmerized Christine with his beautiful voice and songs. On the second morning, Christine demasked him and was horrified to see his deformed face. Later, the phantom committed murder in order to make Christine the leading soprano. Christine was in fear and told Raoul that she had seen Phantom. Raoul swore to protect her and they made an oath of their mutual love. The phantom overheard of it and decided to take revenge. 6 months later, while in the masked ball, Phantom showed up with his newly written opera script Don John Triumph. He appointed Christine to sing it. Christine refused to sing, but Raoul pursued her to sing since he wanted to use this chance to catch Phantom. The opera house was surrounded with police on the day of the performance. That evening, the phantom murdered the tenor and played the tenor himself. He sang with Christine in a touching, passionate way that it would make us to believe it was the Phantom who Christine loved. For some unknown reason, Christine unmasked him in front of the audience; and the Phantom took Christine to his lair and wanted to make her his bride. Raoul came to the lair to free Christine but ended up to be captured by the phantom. The phantom demanded that Christine choose between him and Raoul. Christine kissed the phantom, and the phantom was shocked by her kiss. At that point, he let Christine and Raoul leave.  <br />(2) Music: The music in this play is intoxicatingly beautiful. I haven't watched the stage play yet, but I have listened to the original London record. I think Butler/Emmy/Patrick sing pretty well, even though Sara/Mike of the London stage, in my opinion,  play sing better. Butler's voice is more like that of a pop singer, but butler can act. Some people say the director chose the wrong person, a good looking man with a bad voice rather than a bad looking guy with a beautiful voice. Being movies that are visual, who would want to see an ugly guy in the leading romantic role? If we see a 50 years old horrible looking man deeply in love with a beautiful teenager girl, we would feel so disgusted. While Butler's phantom is dark, strong and powerful, Patrick's Raoul is sunny, and sometimes even insipid, that's what Raoul should be. This makes for a great contrast between the two men and shapes their characters even more profoundly. Emmy is also my new idol nowJ She is so beautiful and has a nice voice. Her voice is not as beauitful as Sara, but she was only 16; like Phantom said in the movie, if she wants to excel, she has much to learn. Sara's voice is professional. So I suggest, if are more drawn to the story, then watch the movie. The beautiful people in the movie are eye candy, very pleasant to watch, and you can ignore their imperfect voices. If you listen to the CD, listen to Sara and Michael's music. Their voices are delightful to listen to.  <br /> <br />(3) Actor/actress. I liked the fact that in this movie the phantom is young and handsome. The phantom is a focus in the movie, and he literally steals every scene. Many people criticise his voice, but I just loved his voice. He sings with passion. Many people don't think his makeup is that bad looking, but to me, it was. I wouldn't say that his face is gorgeous. He is gorgeous not because of his face, it is because of his character.  His masculinity, his sex appeal and voice, his chiseled features of the other unmasked face, and most important, his passion towards Christine, all these together, lead us to no longer pay attention to his face.  <br />Emma is also the perfect girl to play Christine. She is young, beautiful and has a high quality voice; what more we can ask for? And handsome Raoul; no doubt, in my heart, I can't think of any other actors are better suited to play Raoul. He is bland, because that is what is needed to contrast with the phantom. If he were as interesting as Phantom, Christine would not have such a struggle deciding between them. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. I especially adore the two new managers; they have added the right amount of humor to this sad movie.  <br />(4) The setting: Eye candy. The opera house and costumes are incredibly opulent and lavish. <br /> <br />Let me summarize my favorite stage scenes in the movie: <br />(1) Masquerade: visually spectacular! The music, dance and costumes are fantastic. I love one particular young black and white masked male dancer dancing solo; it was fabulous! <br />(2) The first time phantom invited Christine to his lair: The rock-n-roll style song and the mystery of the underground lair are just breathtaking. The candle scene was hypnotic. <br />(3) Music of the night: phantom was so passionate about the music that I feel he is the king of the music kingdom; no wonder Christine was mesmerized by his music and had no fear of him at all. <br />(4) Pass the point of no return:  Their duet is so sensationally powerful that you believe they are the true lovers. Even Raoul was hurt by watching it; I think he realized it was Phantom that Christine was drawn to.  <br />(5) Finally, Phantom sits in front of the Monkey music box whispering the tone of Masquerade, and Christine appeared, Phantom was happy to see her and only then found out that she was back to return his ring. Phantom finally sings out : \\"Christine I love you.\\" If you are not touched at this very emotional moment, you must be cold blooded.
0345363132|5.0|Just got through my second reading of this nearly perfect novel about four days ago, and I still can't get my mind off of it, just like last time (where I was driven to stay up until nearly 5am on a worknight to finish it....seems to be a very similar experience with many of the reviewers!) <br /> <br />It is one of the very few books (and I've read a lot!) where I was so completely engrossed in the character's lives that I did tons of research afterwards.  It is also the only book that has ever made me weep.  I keep going back to the last two pages of that fateful chapter in which Richard was killed and it wrenches my heart every time - that mere words on a page could affect me this much simply astounds me and thrills me at the same time. <br /> <br />I knew absolutely nothing about Richard before I read it, and it was Sharon's notes in the back of the book describing her research and her personal thoughts that convinced me of Richard's innocence...not that anyone will ever truly know, but her writing makes the whole situation so incredibly plausible I just can't see it any other way. Whereas I don't imagine that Richard was a veritable saint, I do see him as having been fully human and therefore capable of mistakes, as well as inherently good-natured and honorable, loyal and fiercely loving to those who stood with him, and completely and horribly maligned by those in history who stood to benefit from his fall from grace.  <br /> <br />It also inspired in me a ravenous interest in medieval history, and I hope to make the trip across the pond one day to do nothing but visit every single location I can that still exists from the book, including those from Sharon's other books.  I want to do nothing but wander among the ruins, take piles of pictures, think and reflect, and just imagine the characters from the book wandering alongside with me. <br /> <br />This is Sharon's best book, probably in the top three of all books I have ever read, and I will never, ever willingly get rid of my copy.  I am seriously consdering starting it over again right away, but I am not sure I can afford the emotional energy it will take for another reading just yet. <br /> <br />

0783240287|5.0|I remember watching a production of this musical in my country over ten years ago.  So I bought both the CD and this version with Donnie Osmond.  I find it amazing how Webber and Rice were able to make such a great musical from a few passages in the Bible.  And they must have been so young when they did it!  There is an innocence and catchiness to the entire musical.  And like the Bible, it is very timeless.  I can identify with the character when he goes through all his trials.   <br /> <br />I would listen to the CD over and over and watch the video as well.  I never get tired of it.  A great buy.
B000FDEUFS|5.0|There exists up to this day a friendly argument as to whether EAT A PEACH or THE ALLMAN BROTHERS LIVE AT THE FILMORE EAST is the best album the Allman Brothers ever made.  The argument, while friendly, is also at bottom quite pointless.  Every man, woman, and child should have both--at the very least.  Every Allman Brothers album from the best to the worst always had something to say.  The triumphs and trials (yes, sometimes quite literally \\"trials\\" in the legal sense) wrenched and warped the band into non-existence during the 1980's.  Suddenly, with the appearance of the box set, DREAMS, (a damn good box set at that), interest in the band peaked once again and the band reformed with the remarkable success of SEVEN TURNS followed by an excellent string of albums through the 1990's.<br /><br />But EAT A Peach represents the end of the classic lineup featuring Duane Allman--one hell of a guitar player.  Unfortunately, Duane would never see the success he had been working so hard to achieve for his band and for himself.  As both volumes of THE DUANE ALLMAN ANTHOLOGY show, Duane offered his services to just about anyone could who use him:  Wilson Picket, Herbie Mann, Delaney & Bonnie, Boz Scaggs, Aretha Franklin, Lulu (!?Lulu?!) and a host of others.  But it was with the appearance of THE ALLMAN BROTHERS LIVE AT THE FILMORE EAST and LAYLA AND OTHER ASSORTED LOVE SONGS (sort of a \\"side project\\" with Eric Clapton that burnt out Clapton's fire for some time) that his mastery and greatness was recognized.  This edition of EAT A PEACH is the very best one to have.<br /><br />The first disc contains the entire original two LP set of EAT A PEACH.  It marked an expansion of the band into new writing and mood.  What strikes me even after all these years how joyous EAT A PEACH IS.  The lyrical themes cover all the class \\"blues\\" subjects of giving up on a woman, sweet memories of a woman lost to the singer, cheating lovers and avoiding angry husbands.  But the actual music is one glorious romp filled with excellent singing and hot guitars.<br /><br /> \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\", \\"Melissa\\", \\"One Way Out\\" are stand out tracks that bear all the sweetness and smoke of Southern country boy blues.  \\"Melissa\\" has been a particular favorite that is so perfect it almost makes you cry that nothing like it was ever to be made again.  \\"Melissa\\" is simply one of the most beautiful songs in the rock catalogue.  Dicky Betts' \\"Brers in A Minor\\" begins with a dive into the blue waters of atonal jazz that establishes the band's musical credibility if not quite everyone's cup of tea.  But, keeping with the Allman Brothers' true spirit, \\"Brers\\" turns into a duel between Dicky Betts and Duane Allman that just rocks.  \\"Blue Skies\\" is joyous and uplifting song of the country side and the wonders of loving a good woman.  \\"Trouble No More\\" and \\"Stand Back\\" stand more in the vein of \\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\" if a little less artful but memorable nonetheless.  \\"Little Martha\\" ends the album as Duane Allman's instrumental farewell.  It sweet and glorious if a sad \\"goodbye\\" from a genius who died too young.<br /><br />Strangely, the core of EATA PEACH is the extended \\"jams\\" or \\"boogies\\" called (of course) \\"Mountain Jam\\".  Based loosely on Donavon's \\"There Is A Mountain. \\"Jam\\" is so long that it had to be broken into two LP sides on the original 1972 release.  Here it presented as one piece without the separation of the original LP.  When EAT A PEACH was first released in 1972, it didn't take the college boys very long to realize that \\"Mountain Jam\\" was a continuation of \\"Whipping Post\\" from THE ALLMAN BROTHERS LIVE AT THE FILMORE EAST.  In other words, as performed at the actual performance, all the pieces fit together in one long 56 minute song/instrumental fest.  It had everything from Gregg Allman's wrenching vocal lamentation, guitars switching leads, guitars in duets, changing melodies, and drum solos.  Thousands labored hard with their cassette recorders to put all the parts together in one seamless stream.  Those born after the heydays of the first half of the seventies may question \\"why\\"; but long instrumental performances were quite popular at the time.  The \\"long versions\\" of what were originally three minute songs marked the difference between juvenile \\"hits\\" and serious rock music lovers.  Tastes have changed and long \\"boogies\\" are no longer done; but they were wonderful to behold.  In any event, in these days of the CD, the entire \\"Mountain\\" performance is presented in its entirety on the Chronicles version THE ALLMAN BROTHERS BAND: THE FILLMORE CONCERTS.<br /><br />Like the deluxe edition of Santana III, this edition includes a second disc of the band's complete last performance at the Fillmore East as Bill Graham was closing the venue to build larger concert halls.  This disc is every bit as good as THE ALLMAN BROTHERS LIVE AT THE FILMORE EAST.  The song list is jumbled up in a little different order and included three extra songs:  \\"Don't Keep Me Wondering\\", \\"One Way Out\\" and \\"Midnight Rider\\".  Fun in its own way.<br /><br />The Allman Brothers would move on to a new phase with BROTHERS AND SISTERS the following year which marked a brand new success for the Allman \\"family\\".  It began to disintegrate after that as fame, drugs and in-fighting took their toll.  A new generation of rock bands rose up and, as they say, the rest is history.<br /><br />If music is important to you in the spiritual sense of the art and not just a kind of background soundtrack in your life, then it is time to drink the water from this well.

B0007P3582|3.0|The Massacre is a long album with a lot of weak tracks which bring it down, but the beats are really good for the most part and if you enjoy some of 50s other work there are a lot of songs worth listening to. <br /> <br />A lot of people hate 50 Cent for the Piggy Bank song but personally I find it funny the way he knows he will sell more records if he disses loads of people and then goes on to shout \\"more money more money\\". Most people probably don't see this track the same as I do but I like it. <br /> <br />I recomend downloading this album and deleting the weaker tracks because some of it is quite good. <br /> <br />Top 5 songs: <br />1. My Toy Soldier feat. Tony Yayo <br />2. I Don't Need Em <br />3. Piggy Bank <br />4. Ski Mask Way <br />5. In My Hood
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Other than the explanation of where he (Blade) came from, who he and everyone else is, at the beginning, this film stands nicely on its own. for those of you that know the first one, then this opening explanation will be a little irritating (and a tad confusing, but it becomes clear later). The opening does smell strongly of franchise potential, being repeated in all the inevitable sequels still to come. Once past this though, we are lead through a massive fight and action scene that sets up the whole movie. and warns anyone who can't stand Hong Kong action scenes that they are probably watching the wrong screen.<br /><br />The movie is essentially a platform for Snipes to have fun with his most renowned character. And he does so with very entertaining results. The movie has reasonably well rounded characters, suspicion piled on top of everyone, some amazing set pieces and a good sense of humour. The impact of all the blood and guts is reduced by the obvious fantasy of the fights (wires and SFX a lot of the time), but its still pretty powerful.<br /><br />The lead performances are all very good, although some of the peripheral characters are a little too hammer horror. Luke Goss demonstrates great potential, although you would need to see him without the make up, body doubles, and special effects to really judge. and there is occasionally that urge to shout \\"when will I be famous.\\" and the pure blood female vampire who takes a shine to blade is well worth being bitten by.<br /><br />Overall it feels less like a sequel and more like a stand alone movie. with this in mind, I think its in fact better than the original (a rare example of the exception that proves the rule).
B0000039QA|5.0|Life after Death is real, along with BIG (R.I.P.) and possibly the best. I personally prefer All Eyez on Me. I think that Biggie had the best flow EVER.

B000084T18|4.0|There are a lot of great songs on this CD. 50 Cent's lyrics aren't exactly life changing but he doesn't do too badly. The beats are good all the way through and it's a very solid album with no skits   - unless you count the 2 or 3 second intro and the 30 second conversation at the start of 'Heat'. <br /> <br />There are a few weak songs, namely 'Like my style' and 'Poor lil' rich' but overal I can listen to the whole album. <br /> <br />Top 5 Songs: <br />1.

B0001AVZA8|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a very long time. I saw it on TNT, recently, and went right out and purchased the DVD and the soundtrack. It was funny, light, and very entertaining. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton were wonderful, as usual. However, I enjoyed the fine performances by Amanda Peet and Keanu Reeves, as well. Frances MacDormand had a small part but added to the fine cast. <br />Diane Keaton plays,Erica Barry, a divorced mother of an adult child who is a very successful playwright and lives in upscale Hampton. <br /> <br />Jack Nicholson plays,Harry Sanborn, the owner of a hip hop label called \\"Drive By\\". He enjoys dating much younger women and was dating Erica Barry's daughter, Marin, previously. He has a hard time committing to any relationship and suffers from multiple \\"heart attacks\\". <br /> <br />Amanda Peet plays, Marin, Erica Barry's 30 year old daughter who also suffers from committing in a relationship. She was previously dating Harry and brings him to her mother's Hampton beach house for a little romp when Harry suffers from a near fatal heart attack. <br /> <br />Keanu Reeves plays, Dr. Julian Mercer, who is the emergency doctor who cares for Harry after his heart attack. It is at this time that he meets and falls in love with Erica Barry with whom he has a relationship with before she dumps him for Harry, a more age appropriate companion for her. <br /> <br />Frances MacDormand plays,Zoe, Erica's sister who encourages the relationship between her sister and Julian. <br /> <br />Erica writes a play based on her relationship with Harry which ends with the two of them (along with Julian) in Paris. It was the French music and the scenes of Paris that helped make this romantic movie so endearing. <br /> <br />I enjoyed seeing a movie about two mature adults falling in love. It was a pleasure to see a movie that showed that it is still possible to fall in love at any age. <br /> <br />This movie is well worth seeing and the price is right, too.
0441003257|1.0|I am a true Gaiman fan, but I do not feel that this book was a good one.  It was too light for me.  I was so annoyed by the lack of plot and the fact that the plot there was didn't make any sense that I did not even laugh once at the \\"funny\\" notations on every page.  This book was one of the worst ones I have read in a long time and it pains me to say this about Gaiman, but it is the truth.  If you are really drawn to purchase this book---do yourself a favor and read a chapter before purchase you'll be glad you did.  This book was terrible.  If this was really genius then it is totally over my head and I am totally unaware of it.  I kept reading it instead of putting it down because it was Gaiman and I kept thinking it has to be worth it in the end.  Much to my dismay it was not.  It was horrible the entire way through.
0812974611|5.0|I love good historical fiction.  It's a painless way to enjoy a good novel while absorbing some history.  \\"Pompeii\\" satisfied me on both counts.  The storyline and characters are well developed, and the backdrop of Roman life and culture were fascinating.  As a civil engineer, I especially loved the details of the aqueduct system for transmitting and distributing water, and how water played such a huge role in the Roman Empire.<br /><br />Once the eruption of Vesuvius begins, \\"Pompeii\\" races to its conclusion.  Harris gives a horrifying description of what it was like for the citizens of Pompeii, who were still recovering from a devastating earthquake a few years earlier.  It was painful to read about the successive stages of the eruption, each more deadly than the previous one, until the final explosion of superheated gases finished off those who hadn't escaped by then.<br /><br />My hat is off the the author for keeping the book under 400 pages.  He tells a big story without any excess verbiage.<br /><br />The inclusion of a romantic interest for Attilius (the main character) was a nice touch which leads to an interesting ending (no more - that would be spoiling it).<br /><br />A superb book whether you read it just as an exciting novel or for the history.
0385512104|5.0|I just finished reading Mark Haddon's book. While I wouldn't say it is the best book I have ever read, it is thought-provoking and provides an interesting insight into people that are autistic. I'm a high-school teacher with a degree in Psychology and while I agree that the character Christopher is not \\"typical\\" of someone with autisim or Asperger's, he is an excellent example of their perspective of how the world reacts to them. <br /> <br />While some reviewers are obviously irritated or offended by the use of coarse language, or the \\"odd\\" style of writing, if these factors don't bother you I would highly recommend reading this book. <br />
0385486804|5.0|Don't think about it or read any further. Just buy it.  It's well worth 10 bucks and the very few hours it takes to read it.  This is the best outdoors/adventure book I've ever read. If you are at all adventurous (or wish you were) you will enjoy the author's search for the root of what motivates people like McCandless.    Krakauer's tale is not simply an account of Chris McCandless's life.  It was never intended to be.  In fact the author spells this out very clearly in his Introduction.  Another reviewer accuses Krakauer of using mostly unrelated material to fill up pages.  Unfortunately, this reviewer does not really understand the purpose of these other stories.  The other people Krakauer profiles are as much a part of what Krakauer is exploring as is McCandless's story.    Krakauer is delving into the McCandless/Ruess personality type as much as he is delving into the life of Chris McCandless.  He does a wonderful job juxtaposing the journeys and trials of McCanless with relevant similar or dissimilar characters including the well known Everett Ruess to the lesser know Carl McCunn.  The result is a masterful work about a \\"personality type\\" that more often than not leads itself to tragic unintended ends.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|Keira Knightly is just an appallingly bad actress nowhere near up to this role.  She is hauled along through this along with Matthew Macfadyen (Mr. Darcy) and Kelly Reilly (Caroline Bingley), slightly better actors but weak overall.  Actually, part of what disappoints one in Kelly is simply bad costuming - she dresses and gives the impression she's walking out of a rather elegant party sometime in the 20th century versus the 19th - her hair's wrong, too.  The rest of the cast is somewhat amazing in establishing a sense of authenticity and picking up their roles - the costuming and photography, the settings will suck you in and make you watch!  A heavy Hollywood thumbprint is unfortunately highly visible in a few scenes: the `Titanic' ending someone thought was a good idea! (Bull!) - and the Church `joke' that dared to take a perfectly respectable 19th century word and serve it up on a platter for modern sensibilities so that a hip-hop audience could giggle at it.  Sorry - you've just walked past the proscenium, it doesn't work - it murders the historical authenticity you've invested so much to establish!  Excellent performances: Donald Sutherland (Mr. Bennett - so perfect but unexpected for this role), Tom Hollander! (Mr. Collins), Simon Woods (he glows), Brenda Blethyn (Mrs. Bennett - this is such an easy role to steal!).  Amazing scenery.
0395645662|4.0|I came across The Giver while teaching a high school English class.  I read it leisurely over one weekend, enjoyed it, and found myself reflecting over it for several weeks.<br /><br />The Giver won the 1994 Newbery Medal for most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.  It is, along with the sequels mentioned below, dystopian in outlook.  The Giver is thought provoking and appropriate for adolescent or young adult readers.  It certainly could be used in a middle or high school literature or English class.  As with many well-written books, it can be read just as a good story however, issues such as community, security and individual liberty are reoccurring themes.  Those ideas are not presented in a graphic or sexual way but for the reader to understand them a certain level of mental maturity is required.  I would recommend the book for good readers starting at about the age of twelve.<br /><br />The milieu of the story is fascinating and believable in most of its detail.  The protagonist, Jonas, lives in a world that appears, on the surface, like a utopia but that veneer covers a darker side of humanity.  Resist reading reviews that reveal the details of this world, they should be discovered as the author intended.<br /><br />Readers tend to have strong opinions about the ending of The Giver.  I find the ending lacking in closure and incomplete.  The Giver does not end in the sense of a traditional book--it just stops.<br /><br />Two other books by Lois Lowry are set in different locations of the same world, Gathering Blue and Messenger.  I have reviewed both.  Gathering Blue answers one or two questions left hanging from The Giver but then adds a few more.  Finally, in Messenger, we get more, but not all, answers to questions left over from The Giver.  This might be fine if the books were actually planned as a series, but I do not believe that was the original intention.  Since I believe each book should be a unit unto itself, I can only grant The Giver four stars.<br /><br />Overall, The Giver is an enjoyable book for adolescent or young adult readers and has earned my recommendation.<br /><br />Kyle PrattOverall, The Giver is an enjoyable book for adolescent or young adult readers and has earned my recommendation.

B0000DBJDM|5.0|I just have one question. What planet do these guys come from? This is one of my most listened to DVDs - all the more so after buying Roger Waters In the Flesh and PF's Pulse, both of which I find sanitised overly-lush productions, and unfortunately highly over-rated and disappointing. I love the minimalist sound of early Pink Floyd - and this film captures them at their psychedelic best.  <br /> <br />Unlike Pulse, there's no fancy light shows or distracting films to underscore how boring the performance is. A lot of reviews express disappointment at The Director's Cut - I've owned this feature 18 months and never watched the main film. I just watch the original movie - it's more than captivating enough. <br /> <br />It was a work of genius to film this in Pompeii, it emphasises the spacy nature of the music, the other-worldliness of their productions. It's hypnotic. <br /> <br />What I like about it best is the lack of extra musicians and backing singers - its just Pink. I listen only to live music, primarily to see musicians play. In South Africa, the major - or minor bands for that matter - never seem to make it this far, so seeing them live on DVD is the next best. <br /> <br />I wish a whole lot more Sixties music would be brought out on DVD - and I'm not even a flower child of the Sixties, though I sometimes wish I was!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|I was expecting a good movie, and my expectations were gratified. Nanny McPhee's tooth is cool! (No Spoilers Included)<br /><br />The open-ended one sentence summary: A father of seven very naughty children searches for a nanny to get them in line and a wife so he can keep the house.<br /><br />Content Inappropriate for All Ages: Gross and mildly disturbing pranks, a mistaken allusion to \\"adult situations\\", maybe a bad word, scenes in a funeral parlor.<br /><br />Characters: 5 of 5 warts.  First of all, let me say that this film had the benefit of a very talented cast, headed by Emma Thompson. But everybody has their chance to shine here. I felt for the all the \\"good\\" characters, particularly Evangeline. (My sister can tell you that I was earnestly cheering her on!) The children were all pitch perfect. Some of the minor characters, especially the \\"bad\\" ones, were overdone on purpose to be funnier.<br /><br />Plot: 5 of 5 warts. Something about Nanny McPhee suprised me. The title character is more like the plot catalyst than the focus. But that did not detract a bit from my enjoyment. This movie had a charming way of revealing itself bit by bit, just like Nanny McPhee.<br /><br />Cinematography: 4 of 5 warts. Just look around at some of the surroundings in the movie, and how laden in color they are! Perfect messes (there are plenty), and chipped paint on the walls. It's these kind of little details that make the movie worth a second viewing. Color is often used to convey the mood here, and it works well. Only a slightly cheesy moment, involving a donkey. *wink*<br /><br />Music: 4 of 5 warts.  Nothing that particularly outstands, but nothing that detracts either.<br /><br />Impact: 5 of 5 warts.  This is a movie that will make you laugh, feel, and most importantly, think. Nanny McPhee's working terms are enough to make you consider things in your own life.

020161622X|5.0|This is one of those books that you read and then come back to from time to time and reread. For those that have developed for some time, it's a great book to read for an occasional tune up. For those just beginning, it's a great way to get off on the right foot. It's by far one of my favorite books on general development practices.
B00007945W|5.0|I have the complete set by Julliard and also have some individual quartets recorded by other groups. The recordings done by the handful of world renowned string quarets who will tackle these are all outstanding. When you are dealing with muscianship on such a high level it becomes meaningless to compare and criticize one recording over another. The Julliard version recorded in front of a live audience really captures a lot of excitment. But the other recordings you will find on Amazon are great also. The main thing is to start listening.  These works are rarely played on radio, perhaps because of their length which often exceeds that of many symphonies. You need your own CD set to play them enough to really appreciate them. So make the effort whichever version you get.
B000BTC5LW|3.0|After reading many of the highly positive reviews, I bought Pulse with high expectation. My expectations were all the more high because I'd been extremely disappointed with the corporate sound of In the Flesh by Roger Waters. However, what I found is more of the same. Two guitarists, two drummers, two keyboardists, a host of backing singers - I struggled to spot the band amid the throng. <br /> <br />But that's not the worst. I found the light display and background video all but completely dominated proceedings to the extent that I found the band irrelevant. Try as I might, I could not avert my eyes from the moving pictures, which were boring in the extreme. I had the creepy feeling much the time that I was watching a movie with a fantastic soundtrack. I kept waiting to actually see David Gilmour, Richard Wright and Nick Mason. When I did see them they were pinpricks at the bottom of a film screen. The music itself is excellent - but I already own the CDs, and in truth rarely listen to them. <br /> <br />What I was hoping to see was actual musicians playing their music - sweating over guitar and drum solos. The phrase, 'their own tribute band' has never seemed to me more true than this feature.  <br /> <br />What I'd love to see is Pink Floyd themselves playing, which is why I treasure PF Live in Pompeii far more than this. I don't understand why this is so highly rated except by people discontent for technical reasons. I find this dull.
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The 2nd season of Veronica Mars is the best tv I've ever seen.  Beats Buffy and Angel and that says a lot.  Rob Thomas must have learned something from Joss Whedon for the Joss man has proclaimed himself one of the show's greatest fans. <br /> <br />The season starts out with a bang literally as we have a busload of students blasted off a cliff and Logan still reeling from accustions of murder from the season 1 cliffender on the bridge. <br /> <br />The season brings out many twists in both mysteries and keeps the audience guessing as the show seamlessly weaves a \\"mystery of the week\\" with the season long arcs.  Some may think this latest season too dense, too complicated, but I love my shows to challenge me and keep me thinking. <br /> <br />Patience is important and so is character-development.  VM does this so well.  The writing of characters, main and guest, is so sharp and the acting so well done.  Quirky quotable quotes abound in each episode with wit and irony. <br /> <br />A must buy DDV if you love your heroines sassy and the love interests compelling (Logan and Veronica are mesmerizing every time they share the screen whether snarking or actually making nice.) <br /> <br />
B000FFJ85I|2.0|AFI were once a favorite beginning with the likes of Black Sails in the Sunset, Answer That and Stay Fashionable, The Art of Drowning, leading up to their gloomy, emotionally driven Sing the Sorrow. <br /> <br />Decemberunderground lacks any uniqueness AFI once had. Uninteresting lyrics under a copy-cat sound of today's popular bands, with a lil' techno tossed in. I won't be chasting them just because I come off as an AFI listener who admired their old stuff. I admire an artist's willingness to veer into new territory to expand their creativity (ever get tired of hearing the same thing?). Perhaps AFI succeeded here and I'm not seeing it, but with pop culture seemingly reverting back to the '80s, AFI seem to follow in those steps blindly. <br /> <br />The album does have a few ups that ring something good to my ears. \\"Affliction\\" is a favorite, and I can't help but listen to \\"Miss Murder\\" (I hardly watch TV or listen to the radio nowadays). That's about it. <br /> <br />Other than that, Decemberunderground is a disappointment.
1400032717|4.0|Quick...what's 856 X 342. Too late...Christopher Boone already has the answer. As an autistic young boy growing up in England, Christopher has his own shares of obstacles including his obsessive behavior, his fear of public places, and his own father. More importantly, however, Chris teaches us to look at the world a bit differently and, in the end, more richly. <br /> <br />Novelist Mark Haddon has struck gold with his realistic 1st person narration from the eyes and head of an autistic child. Haddon's experience working with this disorder allows him to recreate the autistic experience for the reader adroitly. We really feel Christopher's frustrations, his fears, and his joys.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to whomever wants a quick-paced story about a young autistic boy lost in one of the busiest cities on the planet. I highly recommend you pick up a copy!

B00006L3S3|4.0|I always viewed Mind Games as the Return of John Lennon.  Consider that he took his leave along about 1968, when Unfinished Music No. 1 came out.  At the same time, Paul asserted his artistic direction over the Beatles, which in turn became a frontal assault on the long term viability of the same.<br /><br />For five years John disappeared into a personal, albeit not artistic, limbo - screaming, exorcising, experimenting, which in one case produced the climcatic masterpiece \\"Plastic Ono Band\\".  Self-indulgent detours masking as art were his norm then:  Unfinished Music, The Wedding Album, Revolution 9, Live Jam, and although I can't say that I truly dislike these efforts when taken in their intended spirit, indeed you have to try to \\"get\\" the effect Yoko had on him and how it ended up liberating him artistically (although sadly - we only have Double Fantasy to show for it) - still it became distracting.<br /><br />Mind Games is the return of Beatle John, which in my view is Real John.  Or better yet - the best, truest John is the Beatle that married Yoko.  Background vocals are reminiscent of the Abbey Road sound.  He recovers his pop chops, is not so excessively angry, and at long last John is having fun again.<br /><br />It also is one of the two albums that he recorded without another Beatle present.  He and Yoko may be blamed somewhat for breaking up the Fabs, but when all is said and done he is the one that returns unapologetically to the Beatles sound, over and over again - especially on Mind Games.<br /><br />If you have never heard this album, and are a Beatles fan - I would say that after all these years you should try it.  I think you will be pleased.

B00004XONN|5.0|Does it take a few listens to appreciate? Sure...but it also jumps right out at you from the first time you pop it in the player. <br /> <br />After about five plays, Kid A had already assured itself a place on my list favorite album. The music is wonderful - electronic perhaps, but Kid A still retains the very core composition techniques that have guided artists since the times of Mozart.  <br /> <br />As with all Radiohead work, the lyrics are amazing. Thom sounds confused, confident, disillusioned, and afraid all at once throughout the album. The unsung hero of this album has to be Phil Selway, whose drum work carries Kid A from its pretentious and avant-garde start to a successful finish. The end of Kid A is beautiful; after hearing fear in The National Anthem and Morning Bell, doubt in Optimistic, rejection in How to Disappear Completely, and eery aloofness in Treefingers, Motion Picture Soundtrack crescendos with angelic harp work, a divine explosion of sound, and  Radiohead letting us know that they'll \\"see you in the next life \\" <br /> <br />I am hard pressed to pick favorite tracks, as the album is best listened to as a single piece of work. <br /> <br />Favorite Tracks: <br /> <br />» Everything in its Right Place <br />» Kid A <br />» The National Anthem <br />» Optimistic <br />» Idioteque
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|I saw this when it was first televised in 1977. On a small black and white TV. There were no subtitles.    Viewing it again on the DVD--this time with color and titles--only made it better.    A youthful Pavarotti, with his incredibily then sweet voice, is actually thin (for him!). Scotto gives an impassioned performance as Mimi.    These guys knew they were going down into operatic posterity on this historic occasion and would be watched by millions. The rest of the cast is professional but do not rise to the same level.    I thought the whole thing so moving and terrific, even while agreeing with the minor criticisms of the other reviewers, as well as the many virtues they point out.    But, really, nothing quite says it to me as the following...    My 20 year old son bought this for my birthday in 2006. As a good sport he agreed to watch it with me. (Opera is not exactly his  music!) He was appropriately attentive during the first three acts. But once Mimi reappeared in Act IV his demeanor yet changed. He was now leaning forward, intently focused, almost frozen, riveted to the screen.

0767830555|5.0|Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver was one of the most contreversial films of the 1970's, winner of the prestigous Palme d'Or award (Best Film) at the Cannes film festival, and nominated for many prestigous awards at the BAFTAS and the Academy Awards. This film shot Scorsese, De Niro, and Foster under the lime light. This is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece, and one of his finest films to date.<br /><br />Taxi Driver opens with a dreamy opening sequence where we see Travis Bickel gliding through the streets of New York city with superb imagery and colours. This story follows the uneducated and somewhat disturbed man that goes by the name of Travis Bickle, he gets a job as a cab driver because he can't get any sleep. As he does his job he starts seeing and experience the dirty, gritty, and savage side of New York nobody ever sees, the story is narrated to us by Travis and gives us a chance to get inside his head. Travis then starts watching a women that goes by the name of Betsy, she works as an aide to New York State Senator Charles Palentine who is a nominated candidate in the presidential elections, he claims she's an angel in all this chaos and decides to talk to her and ask her out to a movie. Travis also starts to a plan to clean the 'scum' off the street, and starts stalking the senator Palentine. One of the key plots in the story is his obsession for saving a twelve and a half year old prostitute named Iris from this immoral world (through his mind) that lies around him.<br /><br />This film is a piece of excellent art rather than a \\"movie\\". The Direction from Scorsese once again is masterfull, the cinematography is one of the many treasures that can be found in this film. The wonderful score fits perfectly with the narration and imagery. Robert De Niro is absolutely brilliant in this, he does a wonderful job that is the disturbed Travis Bickle, but the rest of the cast shouldn't be overlooked as well, the characters are excellently played by Foster as the prostitute Iris, Keitel as the pimp 'Sport', Shepherd as Betsy, and Brooks as Tom. The characters are superbly written by the screenwriter Paul Schrader<br />and are fantasticly directed by Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />All in all this is a superbly crafted film by Scorsese and should definately be on the film junkie's shelf. But, this wont be for everyone's taste, people will find it too disturbing, violent and dark. So I wouldn't reccomend watching it with your girlfriend or mom, or any woman who are easily upset or sensitive. But you haven't watched a Scorsese film until you've watched Taxi Driver. My highest reccomendation.<br /><br />The special features on the disc are average. There's a very interesting and highly deatailed making of the film, with all the people who were involved in the making of the film, Scorsese, Schrader, Keitel, Foster, Shepherd, Brooks, and ofcourse De Niro. The documentry is 70 minutes long, but is a great way to find out the details of what went into the film. Other features include: a trailer, interactive full script of the film, this means you can change to the movie and back to the script to see what they changed and what they kept.

0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa's follow up to Roschomon is his masterpiece among masterpieces, 209 minute epic masterpiece is the definitive Kurosawa picture and inspired generations of films, film makers, and audiences. There have been many spinoffs but no official remake. The Magnificent Seven was the closest to a proper remake, but replaced Samurai with Cowboys, and swords with guns. A bug's life replaced the Samurai with bugs and insects etc. But, if you've seen these films listed above and haven't seen Seven Samurai, then you're missing out on a beautifully crafted and almost perfectly balanced film, there's not much wrong with this film at all and deserves more than one viewing.<br /><br />The film starts with bandits who are watching over and planning an attack on a helpless village of peasents and farmers, they decide they'll wait for their crops to grow and will attack when there's more grain. The villagers are getting the worst of luck, they lose their food all the time, people get taken away once in a while and they are forced to work. One of the villagers overheard the bandit's plan to attack when the time is right and told the others, while the villagers can't take the missery and pain, a villager suggests that they could fight the bandits and kill them off so there problems will be dead and burried. They all object and say that it's absolute madness. They eventually go to the town elder and ask him what to do. He finnaly suggests they should hire Samurai, four at first. He tells them to get Samurai who will fight for food, they don't have money so they have to pay in food. The Samurai eventually arive and train the villagers for the upcoming assault that will be their fate.<br /><br />This finale is worth the wait, the final battle, in which takes up the last hour of the film, is one of the greatest cinematic achievments of all time. The films costumes and sets are trully magnificent, it really captures the times of the Samurai. The makeup, I have to admit, is dated, you can sometimes see that they are wearing wigs, but don't let this fool your view of this film. The acting is absolutely mesmirising, you trully get attached to the characters and care for their outcome, this is what a film should do. This film was way ahead of it's time in every aspect, the story, the production, the sheer size of it, an epic people weren't expecting, the cinematography, bassicly everything. The cinematography and editing were revolutionary, the cinematography is something that makes you more and more interested, for instance you'll get slow motion cuts on some of the shots, like a kill that is made, or a heroic action.<br /><br />This film has everything, action, comedy, romance, drama, it's a trully brilliant film and deserves the attention that it still gets world wide today. This film can appeal to everyone, not only film fanatics like myself, but to everyone who is looking for an exciting piece of story telling and adventure.s see that they are wearing wigs, but don't let this fool your view of this film.

B000002UJQ|5.0|There was a time in my life where the thing that would get me through a day was this album, A time where only the melencoly vocals of Thom York was what i wanted to listen to. This album means a whole lot to me and helps me when im in need. I rekonmend this album to everyone who can listen to music.  <br />I have a friend, he has the worst taste in music every... Crunk hip hop and system of a down... do i need to say more? But when this friend heard Karma Police, that was all he would listen to! It was amazing almost like there is one song (Karma Police) that everyone can enjoy! But if you think that all this album has to offer is Karma Police, you are very, very wrong!  <br />The 3 top tracks for me are 1) Karma Police (which ive already talked about) 2) Lucky, Lucky is a song with so much emotion its almost unbelivble. The lyrics are poetic and beautiful. I would say this song is \\"depressing\\", its just emotioinal, and 3) Paraniod Android, this song is a epic, almost 7 minute story. And let me say ive never heard anyone get a sound like Jonny Greenwood does from a Telecaster!  <br />In conclusion this album is certainly in my top 10 albums and is amazing!

B0009A40ES|5.0|Morals by the wayside with a grandiose explosion of debauchery and mayhem can only describe the film adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' shocking novel \\"American Psycho\\". Christian Bale plays the title role of troubled stockbroker Patrick Bateman, who has worked his way to the top of his stock brokerage with little more than his wealthy father's influence. He lives a predictable life: eating at the hotspots, going to the new clubs, dating beautiful women, and paying $15 for vodka tonics on a regular basis.<br /><br />From the outset of the film we can tell that Patrick's habits are obsessive (to say the least) and his taste in entertainment is bordering on sadistic. After he loses complete interest in work, he begins to manifest elements of the horror movies he watches constantly into his everyday life: he goes on a murder spree. It starts rather benignly, then gets sickeningly more gruesome as the movie progresses. We see him drift slowly into an oblivion of insanity, at which point the viewer begins to question what is real and what is imagined.<br /><br />Christian Bale's tour de force as Ellis' hated character<br /><br />Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman is perhaps one of the best dramatic roles to come from any actor in recent years. His simulation of insanity is easily believable by the viewer: he is a normal, everyday guy that we can identify with. This is what makes it especially shocking to the viewer: society has put Patrick in a box where he can do nothing but succeed, and yet he inexplicably decides to pursue a life as a deranged serial killer almost just to see if he can do it. The label put on him is so effective that when he confesses all his crimes to his lawyer in a moment of clarity, his lawyer doesn't even believe him. His journey begins testing the waters of murder, but ultimately he ends up swimming in an ocean of blood.<br /><br />A controversial ending reminiscent of the book is what truly made this movie for me, but even true fans of Ellis' work are split on if its presence was effective. The aforementioned phone call to his lawyer leads even Patrick to speculate if his insanity has caused him to imagine all of the crimes he has committed, or if they are indeed real. With the amount of live action and murder on screen in the movie, it is plainly obvious that he did not imagine any of this at all. As for the character being insane: there's no question of that. He is as crazy as they come, and Bale makes us believe it.' work are split on if its presence was effective.

B000F7CMRM|1.0|This movie got 1 star from me after watching the sanctimonious interviews in the featurettes.  The viewer is urged to become politically involved about events that are entirely fictional.  Oil companies killing world leaders to get contracts away from the Chinese?

B0009S4IHY|5.0|This was my introduction to writer/director/producter/actor Stephen Chow and the genre of kung fu films.  I have to say that though a lot of the inspirations for this film are derived from inside jokes (mostly easily comprehendable to fans of the genre), they still succeeded in making me laugh (or at least smile), plus computer generated special effects and broad, self effacing humor and you will definitely see why \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" stands out from the other films of its kind.<br /><br />Sing (Stephen Chow) is an aspiring--if clumsy--kung fun master who was told by a begger/con artist as a child that he was the chosen kung fu master and would unlock his potential if he purchased a special book for only $10 (his life savings).  Though, Sing hasn't been able to successfully execute a single kung fu move in all the years that followed that chance encounter, his one true wish it become a part of the very violent \\"Axe Gang\\" that terrorizes the---seemingly--humble residents of Pig Pen Alley in 1940s Hong Kong.  What Sing doesn't realize is that the residents have some martial arts moves of their own (particularly the landlady who has NEVER lost a yelling contest, the tailor, and virtually everyone down to the little boys).<br /><br />Honestly, I can't begin to articulate in this review just what style--visually--this film would fit into.  This, like other films of its kind, has plenty of action packed sequences, gravity defying fights and eye popping depictions of stylized violence (or should I say injury?  you literally see someone's teeth popping out of their head!).<br /><br />This is the biggest blockbuster in Hong Kong history, for good reason.  You will definitely be entertained.  A note:  This is not suitable for young children or young teens.  This is an R-rated film for good reason.  The title speaks for itself.....

He is excellent at constructing \\"what if\\" scenarios and then carrying them to their logical conclusion, with a clever twist at the end.  In The Firm, the question posed is what if your new law firm is secretly owned and operated by the Mafia?  In The Pelican Brief, how do you change a ruling by the Supreme Court, which you know is not going to go in your favor? By killing a few Supremes, of course.<br /><br />In The Broker, the question Grisham posed is not quite as succinct; how does the US government find out who purchased a computer program to control spy satellites launched by an unknown nation?  The story is interesting, if somewhat convoluted, and has a nice wrap up, but is not as precise as some of his previous novels.  The idea of an out-of-control CIA is not as novel these days as the idea of a law firm owned and operated by the Mafia, but it is still plausible.  Details about the technology, an important aspect of the techno thriller, are on the light side, but still believable.<br /><br />Still, the book is an enjoyable read.  Grisham is a master at his craft, and prolific, and I look forward to reading many more of his novels. In addition, I am fascinated by the idea of an author setting his novel in a nice vacation spot, Italy, and potentially writing off expenses as research.  Way to go Grisham.<br /><br />Nelson Adrian Blish
B000F48CD8|5.0|The Raconteurs feature the combined songwriting talents of Jack White from the White Stripes & Brendan Benson.  <br />Unlike most people, I'm more familiar with the work of the latter, though I also like what I've heard from the White Stripes. If you too are a Brendan Benson fan, I'm sure you'll love this CD. In fact, it seems to me that Benson sings lead on most of the songs. These sound like they could be on his solo albums, though they're a bit edgier. I imagine this is White's influence. In my opinion, it's a good thing. Also, the two harmonize very well. The 2 or 3 songs that seem to feature White are decidedly prog-rock, mostly in a Led Zeppelin way (though a bit of ELP too ?!) ... I dunno how this will go over with White Stripes fans, but of course he revives this style in his usual hip way. <br />I'm assuming that the bassist & drummer are from some cool band I haven't heard of, making this a Detroit \\"supergroup\\" of sorts. Either way, they rock. <br />
B0000844I8|4.0|\\"Stargate\\" is fun, pure and simple.  It takes history and science, spins them around in a blender with a cup of fiction, and cranks out a reasonably believable sci-fi classic.  Starring James Spader as a geeky scientist who's really into decoding Egyptian heiroglyphics and a hard-nosed and slightly mentally unstable soldier played by Kurt Russell, \\"Stargate\\" gives the viewer a couple of things to ponder.  What if \\"Ra\\" wasn't an actual god worshipped by early Egyptians, but an alien looking for a nice group of simpletons to turn into his slaves?  What if those simpletons began to pick up on Ra's deception and run him off, only to have him gather up a few stragglers and start a slave colony on another planet that's linked to Earth via a \\"Stargate?\\"<br /><br />All of this sounds a little silly, but deep inside, we all know that there are some reasons to actually entertain the thought that aliens did interact with the ancient Egyptians.  No matter here, it's just used as a backdrop for a wonderful story in which Spader, Russell, and a team of soldiers trek off to the other end of the Stargate in order to see what's there.  When they do get to the other side, they find a colony of people enslaved by Ra.  They're also trying to decipher the gate on their end of the universe in order to get home.  They figure out the entire gate's code almost immediately, except for one symbol, which forces them to interact with the slave colony.  Slowly but surely, they prove to the slaves that Ra can be overthrown and that he isn't an actual god.  Rebellion ensues, and our heroes aid in the battle all the while trying to break the final code.<br /><br />This is a very fun flick to watch.  It mixes just enough parts history, science, and gee-whiz to make for a wonderful tale.  Along with Russell and Spader, it stars French Stewart (Third Rock From The Sun) as one of Russell's troops and Jaye Davidson as Ra.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans of fantasy and sci-fi in general.  The Devlin/Emmerich team hit a homerun with this one before stumbling a bit with \\"Independence Day.\\"  This film is much better and more believable than that flick in my opinion.The Devlin/Emmerich team hit a homerun with this one before stumbling a bit with \\"Independence Day.\\"  This film is much better and more believable than that flick in my opinion.
B000F3AAUW|3.0|Yes, 'Crazy' is a good song (I mean, before it replaced James Blunt's 'You're Beautiful' as most overplayed song in history). But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this CD is a masterpiece.  There are only a handful of hot songs: The Last Time, Gone Daddy Gone, Go-Go Gadget Gospel, Crazy, and Smiling Faces.  THAT'S IT. <br /> <br />You want a real Cee-lo album?? Check out the early Mob releases or the Imperfections CD.  Oh and also, I'm sick of everyone covering 'Crazy' (such as Nelly Furtado, Ray LaMontagne, Cat Power, Heiress Hilton, Kooks, Twilight Singers...etc.) like its the new American Pie,THE SONG IS NOT THAT GOOD! <br /> <br />I remember when ,I remember I remember when they lost their minds...
B00005N6KG|2.0|I bought these headphones b/c they were reviewed in Shape magazine.  It was said that they stay in place and you barely even notice you're wearing them.  WRONG!  These headphones drift out of my ears as I run, and it's completely random as to which side will stay in.  Sometimes both sides pop out!  It's so frustrating and annoying as I'm running to constantly be pushing them back in.  The sound is great when both earpieces are actually in my ears, but that is rarely the case!  Beware!
0688170528|1.0|I knew this book was going to be bad after the first few chapters.   <br /> <br />It was so predictable.  I could have guessed that Emily was going to be pregnant as this story line is used in other lame books.  Chris just creeped me out, I could almost feel my own skin crawl everytime he had sex with Emily and the sex scenes between the parents could have been copied from some cheap, sleazy porn magazine.  There was no suspense, Chris killing Emily was a given and to get the not guilty verdict was just laughable. <br /> <br />If I could give this book no stars I would.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I love the fact that some of the spoken words are part of the tracks. It's just enough to make you think you're watching the movie when you are unable to sit down and actually watch it. If you're like me, I watch it at least once a week.
B00005MP58|5.0|I have watched this mini-series countless times and for me,it is by far the best adaption of Pride and Prejudice . The series really captures the comedy of manners of Jane Austens novel that the recent adaption lacks. The acting is superb as well as the music, costumes and locations. Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are excellent as Elizabeth and Darcy respectivly and have great chemistry.I also enjoy the portrayal of Mr Bennett,whose humor has been transfered very well onto the screen. The 300 minute length may put some people off, but for me, it is thouroughly enjoyable throughout and by the end, I am always left wanting more! The new movie starring Kiera Knightley,  while also very good, simply does not compare to this wonderful adaption.
B000A59PMO|5.0|The plots are interesting (although sometimes they may be pretty fanciful, but that's common to every TV show). The best part of Veronica Mars is the writing and character development. I love Wallace, the boyfriends, the dad, Mac, etc. Of course, Veronica is awesome and lovable, and listening to her dialogue with the other characters is such a treat.
B000002MP2|5.0|Yeah, we all remember Dookie.  The old Green day music that accidentally started their huge rock star life style.  Believe it or not, it was so close to being as big as their new, but not as good, American Idiot.  The sound of this album is so raw and completely different than American Idiot, so don't buy this expecting the Green Day you hear today.  EXPECT SOMETHING BETTER!!
B000002IZ4|4.0|Stone Temple Pilots second album, Purple is their best album ever. Stanout tracks include: Kitchenware and Candy Bars, Interstate Love Song, Big Empty, and Vasoline. All the songs are catchy, timeless, and creative. If you are a huge STP fan, this is the album that made them one of the best grunge bands of the '90s. Buy this gem today!
B00003CXXP|5.0|Yes, it is painful to watch this film. Yes, it's slow. Yes, it's the height of directorial arrogance. Yes, it's why people hate Hollywood. Yes, the script is weak. Yes, Spielberg has lost it. Yes, Spielberg makes movies for himself and his peers rather than the fans. Yes, you'd rather be trapped in an elevator for a week with an insurance salesman. Yes, you'd rather be thrown down a flight of stairs. Yes, you'd rather listen to that know-it-all creep from accounting talk about how much he loves Oregon Duck football. Yes, this movie does end, even though you feel like it never will.
B000EZ7ZYA|4.0|This would be one of two BD titles I would reccomend for demo's. The movie is recent, the content is tame and very bright. So if you are watching on a projector or some other form of hi res screen, you can actually see the difference. The other movie that falls into this same description is 50 first dates. The good thing about both is that they are shipping now!
B000F1IQNM|5.0|Delightful movie for children of all ages! Well done, Emma Thompson! I hope there will be more!
0802130208|5.0|If I had to choose five books to be considered the literary masterpieces of the latter half of the 20th century, this would be one of them.  Ignore all of the cries of \\"loser lit,\\" because this book is far more than that.  Certainly, Ignatius Reilly is a loser by the standards of the society in which we live.  He is an outstanding example of unfulfilled potential.  He seems to hate everything about the society that casts him aside and jeers at him.  However, the quote from which this novel derives its name is eerily true--you can tell a true genius when all of the dunces in his midst form a confederacy against him, and there is something genuinely brilliant about Ignatius' many critiques of our society.  Despite his apparent lack of common sense, the truth behind many of his objections to various facets of the modern West is undeniable.  This genius glows brighter when viewed in light of its age (the book was written during the early 1960s, before the cultural tumults of the latter part of that decade and the sexual, social, and moral shifts that followed), which bares the strangely prophetic nature of Ignatius' worldview.  The book could have been published yesterday and would not have lost any of its relevancy.<br /><br />No collection of 20th century literature can be adequate without a copy of Confederacy of Dunces.
B00005JP5L|5.0|I haven't laughed this much at a movie in a while, I absolutely loved it! Definitely a new favorite. Like the viewer below said, the climax of the movie is hilarious, something you'd never expect.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|I enjoyed this DVD and it was nice to see a few artists I was not too familiar with like Robert Randolph and Johnny Lang. <br />As many others have mentioned, not to have Jeff Beck on the DVD is a real glaring ommison.I also thought ZZ Top were way past their prime on this recording. <br />Joe Walsh looked drunk to me as well, but then he seems to always look and act that way. I really enjoyed a number of artists on DVD #2 such as the incomprable John Mclaughlin. Steve Vai seems to make playing look so easy and fun!
B000005RQT|5.0|If I was required about the most concise, mature and pyramidal work around the entire discography of this milestone band, I should bet for this one. Somehow this work was the final product of what we used to call, the essence of the musical thinking of this hard rock ensemble.<br /><br />I can still remember the glimmering riffs, the powerful conjunction of that synergy in action. First at all, there is no minor track. Every track possesses an overwhelming personality, if I may. The profuse creativity around the nature of these emblematic themes I s another aspect to remark. From the flaming screams of Child in time where the increasing tension is really admirable. Speed king is one of the most rounded pieces in the rock's story. Bloodsucker is another striking flag. Flight of the rat is a classic rock theme but what conviction and character. Into the fire reveals the boiling point state of rage and explosiveness of the whole ensemble.<br /><br />On the other hand, we should to take into account that almost this program was taken into that glorious tour Made in Japan, that as all of us know about it's one of these milestone albums ever recorded.<br /><br />Additionally, it's absolutely necessary to acquire this record , because of the fact it was an anthological breakthrough not only in the golden trajectory of Deep purple, besides the enormous specific weight that this work constituted for future bands to born, allowed to expand the sonorous possibilities of this genre.<br /><br />And finally, the cover of this legendary record was an absolute prodigious of brilliant creative irreverence.<br /><br />Inch by inch and moment by moment this is a giant record that occupies a status place among the biggest rock recordings.<br /><br />Forever Purple !
B000AMJDHY|2.0|A delightfully clever, sarcastic dress up album which takes emotional toe tapping music to the big time. A Fever You Can't Sweat out, is the debut album from Panic! At The Disco. From the bands name to then thoughtfully cutting long drawn out titles of the songs, you wouldn't be blamed for having preconceptions about this band. You cannot talk about P!ATD without referencing Fall Out Boy.The obvious factor is that the band is the first to be signed to Peter Wentz (FOB bassist) Decaydance Records. \\"...Imagine The Faint meets The Postal Service with all of the pop sensibilities of a Blink 182\\" Wentz tells us, though it is hard to imagine this band having the staying power of a band like Blink 182. The band also have appeared to have sprung from nowhere on an unsuspecting public, ready to embrace pop rock at it's very poppiest. To put it simply, the band do not seem sincere. They seem like a record company's attempt to catch onto this new thing the kids are calling emo. And to be frank, it shows. <br />Of course the songs are catchy, and at times unique, blending smooth vocals with pop driven melody rock. However, this is nothing new. You are left wondering if this is a joke album, an album to see how much cheesiness you can take before. Though, it is a fun album. And when it is fun, it doesn't need to make sense, nor does it have to challenge genres, or the listener, apparantly. The bottom line is, if you like Fall Out Boy, you will either eat this up, or feel cheated.  <br /> <br />Panic! At The Disco are a pop band. Nothing more, nothing less, and they never promised to be anything more.
B00000DC10|5.0|This CD is absolutely amazing!  A mixture of genres including old-school punk, screamo and hard rock.  So many alternative bands nowadays release tracks that are noticably tainted by commercial pop, but these guys have a sound that is pure and original.  If Refused released this CD next week it would easily compete with today's alternative music, even though it was released in 1998! <br /> <br />I would recommend this CD to those who are fans of Rage Against the Machine, Blindside, Emery, The Fall of Troy, The Mars Volta, Project 86, Muse, The Sound of Animals Fighting, or UnderOath.
B000E8NQU4|5.0|After the orchestral overload of \\"Days of Future Passed\\" as well as a couple hit singles with replacements Justin Hayward and John Lodge, the Moody Blues trumped back to the Decca recording studios and began work on the their third album. This time they would go on their own with no outside musicians and take full advantage of the latest 8 track machines and push the envelope sonically and musically. With producer Tony Clarke at the helm the band would really start showing what they were capable of.<br /><br />This package has to be the umpteenth reissue and I have to say they done a real good job in the transfers. I have the Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab \\"gold disc\\" version and I have to admit I can't really hear the difference. Now I have not heard the SACD layer so I am only making comparisons to the standard stereo version.<br /><br /> It was also nice to have a second disc of out-takes and alternate mixes it's just that some of the alternate mixes were not that different from the released versions, maybe a mellotron turned up hear or a different vocal take but nothing drastic. The BBC sessions I feel are the true find and it is interesting to hear songs from \\"ISOTLC\\" in stripped down versions. I am also glad that this was not mixed in 5.1. I am sorry but when the album was originally mixed it was mixed for a stereo (for the hi-fi set) and mono (for everybody else) by the group and Tony Clarke so any decisions were made in the long ago. And the whole point of the existence of DERAM was for Decca to show off their new stereo technique so I was pleased that the mix stayed in tact and not tampered with. Wish I can say for some other ham-fisted 5.1 mixes of classic albums
B000AADYRQ|5.0|One of Death Cab's finest releases, definately worth getting your hands on a copy.  This CD contains one of the best songs released so far, \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan.\\" <br /> <br />If you have not heard Death Cab for Cutie before, then THIS should be the first CD you buy.  But be warned, you will fall in love with their music immediately and probably want to buy all the other albums straight away!
B0007VZ91C|5.0|I have several other Cds by Deva and Miten. I actually spent 3 days with them at a workshop this past April before purchasing this CD, heard some Dakshina music, and was moved to purchase the CD. Well, wow. I have made this a part of my morning meditation practice, and have shared this music with everyone I know. Several of my yoga instructors used this music during a yoga class, and the class was transformed !  <br />Listening to the mantras combined with Deva's haunting voice is truly a blissful experience. It will elevate you and fill you.
B000EMGAOY|5.0|This album happens to reach all my likings as they bring in funk and solid rock tunes, I have split up the rock and funk off the album into one pile and the soft tunes into another altogether, they are 14 funk and rock songs, and 14 soft tracks which are still very good. <br />The only reason I like Mothers MIlk more is because that was the first album I got from them and I love the songs Knock Me Down and Taste The Pain. <br />This is a solid effort by the Chili's. good for an average listener too.
B000GFRDN6|5.0|first this cd is outstanding the sound is as close to the way i remeber the old album but one issue on the song wild mountain honey the song seems to have either a woble or he groveled his his vocales in that one spot.other than that this whole package is first rate ps. remeber those 70s nites.
0064407667|5.0|Prepare to enter a world where most adults are well-meaning and clueless or cruel.  Knowlege is embraced by the noble, and even in the direst situations, there is always the mind to find a solution. <br /> <br />This is a wonderful series, with a very dark beginning.  In the Bad Beginning, Count Olaf is certainly the creepiest and cruelest.  Later on in the series he is portrayed as goofy as well as evil.  The humor is distinct, funny, and melancholy all at once. <br /> <br />Lemony Snicket's narration throughout the story makes me laugh and cry at the same time...but I take stuff way too seriously.  If you are fond of Charles Dickens, Roald Dahl...heck, even Tim Burton, you will find that misery loves company, and you'll love it right back.
0307263118|2.0|Up until the last quarter of this book it would barely have rated  1 star. The denouement made the book interesting.  I agree with previous reviewers that the Booker was awarded for all the \\"big\\" words.  Sadly Kazuo Ishiguro was ripped off, as \\"Never Let Me Go\\" was a much better book.  Then again, \\"Atonement\\" also missed out a few years ago.
B000F8DT4Q|4.0|Without a doubt Tears For Fears are a great 80's band and actually one of the 80's greatest bands. Songs from the Big Chair is (supposedly) their best album. So that must be the reason why the Deluxe Edition was released. Most of Tears For Fears best and most memorable songs are all here. Such songs like the classic trademark 'Shout' as the album's first track, the brilliantly contructed 'The Working Hour', the excellent written 'Everybody Wants To Rule The World' which is TFF's best song in my opinion, the very catchy 'Mothers Talk', 'Broken' and the superb 80's classic 'Head Over Heels' which is surprisingly recorded live while finishing with the end of 'Broken'. These particular songs are what stand out for me on this album. Ever since I got this Deluxe Edition album, I have been unable to stop listening to it. The songs are just so catchy, so rythmic, they sound great and they still live up to todays standards.<br /><br />But............ there are just too many repeated, remixed and extended songs on this 2 disc Deluxe Edition album that seems to weigh down the already great tracks on the first CD. However, some and only some of the extended tracks on this album are an actual improvement. They still sound good but overall, the songs DO clash with each other and it all sounds a bit too repetative.<br /><br />Still, this is a great 80's album with great songs and it won't be long before you get sick of this album from listening to it way too much.
B000002JS0|5.0|I think, High Voltage is a classic example of raw rock and roll band.  With its catchy riffs, and simple lyrics, High Voltage is a fun and entertaining album to listen to.  Bon Scott really puts all of his effort into laying down those lines in TNT, The Jack and Rock and Roll Singer.  I's take Bon over Brian Johnson andy day.  Angus and Malcolm are thebest two rock guitar player I have evr heard in my life.  And Phil Rudd's drum sound and Mark Evans' and George Young's pumping bassline really bring the AC/DC sound together. Well, if you can get your hands on this album, you will really understrand and appreciate what AC/DC is really about.  Ride On, Bon
B000EHRVP6|4.0|Great movie with one of the most disturbing scene I've ever seen... <br />The first 30 minutes are just teenage-movie like which make me  bored but after that just sit and suffer with the characters...
B000025XKM|5.0|A friend of mine told me about this album many years ago. My friend was also suffering from major bouts of depression and taking a lot of anti-depressents. He told me how the song \\"From The Morning\\" helped him when he heard the lyrics \\" I can't think of words. I feel no emotion about anything. I don't want to laugh or cry. I'm numb-dead inside\\". He discovered he wasn't alone in feeling nothing because of the medication. This album works in so many ways. It's one you can listen to at any time and it fits. The first time I heard the whole thing was while driving on the interstate in my car late at night. Perfect. Drake could have been right up there with the premiere singer songwriters of his day had he lived to record more music. Bottom line, I love this CD!
B00000K3CR|5.0|Josh finds a machine at the carnival. He wishes to become big as he thinks it will make him more confident around the girl he likes. The next day, he finds himself as a full grown adult. Him and his best friend travel to New York in search of the machine to wish himself back as a 12 year old kid again. While living in New York, Josh has many responsibilities as he maintains a job. He also deals with his relationship with Susan. In the end, Josh has to decide weather to stay as an adult, or return to being a kid again. <br /> <br />I enjoyed watching this movie. It deals with the many problems that adults and kids face. It teaches kids that growing up aren't all fun and games and that they have more responsibilities as an adult. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good comedy. Seeing how a kid takes on adult responsibilities is comical. One of my favorite scenes is when McMillan and Josh play on the giant piano. The actor's play the roles very well as you forget how absurd it is for a kid to wake up as an adult. I highly recommend this movie.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Superb cast - Clooney, Wright, and Damon excel.  Interesting story.  Clever, creative production.  Unique.
B000092T6M|4.0|I have always loved this movie since I was young. No, you shouldn't have to be of English or Australian decent to play this role just because you have an accent. That would be unfair to those who can act and pull off an accent at the same time. Costner doesn't use an accent because the Director told him not to. Notice near the end of the film when he covers himself in horse manure and pretends to be a blind man, he \\"runs\\" into an English guard and does an accent. So, not necessarily that he can't do it, he wasn't recommended to.  <br />It's a brilliant romantic movie. Many goofs, but it's intended to be a more comical movie rather than many other action based, historical Robin Hoods.

B00005JOQS|2.0|Last summer, director Christopher Nolan reinvigorated the BATMAN legend with a character-driven thrill-ride chock full of surprises and endless invention, but the same can't be said of Bryan Singer's SUPERMAN RETURNS, which feels like a retread for much of its lethargic and bloated running-time. I can't say this was a major disappointment since my expectations going in were modest at best, but this thing was sooo shockingly mundane; nothing in this movie stirs up much excitement or comes close to matching the awe and wonder Richard Donner's film fashioned so exhuberantly.<br /><br />With few exceptions, the casting is disastrous: Bosworth takes the plucky Lois Lane and imbues her with the sum energy derived from digesting a handful of sleeping pills; Spacey's Luthor, while more faithful to the source material than previous screen versions, isn't half as memorable as Gene Hackman's playful take on the character, and Frank Langella is sooo lackluster a Perry White I'm not even sure he was awake when his scenes were shot. As for Routh, he improved as the film progressed, but he still looks more like Superboy (or, more precisely, RUSHMORE's Max Fischer) than the Man of Steel. (His adolescent looks and awkward first attempts to mimic Christopher Reeve's Clark Kent are painful to watch)<br /><br />The missteps in casting could have been glossed over if the film delivered some truly jaw-dropping scenes of Super-derring-do, but there's little suspense or excitement to the action set-pieces that seem regurgitated from previous films, and the special-effects -- the one area it was reasonable to expect improvement in leaps and bounds -- are competent but unambitious and not that big an upgrade from what Donner achieved in 1978. In fact, director Bryan Singer, who did such a fine job with the first two X-MEN films, seems so intent on capturing the style of the Donner classic that he leaves little of his own imprint on SUPERMAN RETURNS.  SUPERMAN RETURNS most reminds me of Tim Burton's \\"re-imagining\\" of PLANET OF THE APES; each had heaps of money lavished on them, but both are completely lifeless. And since when did Clark Kent wear glasses as a young boy??<br /><br />Ultimately, this new SUPERMAN may appeal more to those who didn't grow up with the Christopher Reeve movies, but at 2 1/2 hours, it may be too slow to become the smash Warner was hoping for; it certainly won't rule the box-office for 13 consecutive weeks as the 1978 original did.  In the end, it's ironic the filmmakers chose to feature the song \\"Heart and Soul\\" when SUPERMAN RETURNS had neither.Tim Burton's \\"re-imagining\\" of PLANET OF THE APES; each had heaps of money lavished on them, but both are completely lifeless.

1402555989|4.0|My teenagers high school recommended this book to the whole school to read and they encourage the parents to read the book as well.  I really enjoyed this book because it showed how smart and intelligent a child with autism can be.  The character in this book could solve math problems with ease but really had a hard time with the everyday things that people without disabilities take for granted. I felt compassion for the main character and for his family.  This book gives us a little window into how autism affects a person and their loved ones.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|An amazing DVD at an amazing price. The technical aspects have been covered hugely already, from the 4:3 aspect, being shot on video v film, brilliant 5.1 sound (I wish I had it) etc etc. <br /> <br />But this is an experience! Even with just a 68cm TV with no sound system other than the TV's speakers. It is a comprehensive visual and sonic document on one of the best ever band's legacies to its faithful followers, particularly for those of us not fortunate to have ever seen them live, and anyone else who wants to see a great show.  <br /> <br />I have had the Pulse double live CD for several years and have always thought it was great. For the last year or so I have had the Roger Waters In the Flesh DVD, the only visual live record of Floyd tracks I had. This is 1/4 of the Floyd plus an impressive cast of fill-in musicians and is quite fine too. But Pulse DVD is the real deal. The light show, the effects, and the glorious music put on by 3/4 of the Floyd and some fine suplementary players. <br /> <br />I have watched both of the concert DVDs and not yet explored the extras. But it is great value for money. In Australia it is $25 (I think I paid $35 for the Pulse CDs years ago) or about US$18. It is worth the price for the full DSOTM performance. It is worth the price for the 3 song encore. Hell, I would have paid $25 to see Gilmore's Comfortably Numb just once! <br /> <br />Forget Gilmore v Rogers, 4:3 v widescreen, video v film. Just lay down the paltry sum and watch a damn fine show. And watch it again, and again ....

B0001I561E|4.0|by 1992 and aladdin's release disney was riding high with such hits as \\"the little mermaid\\" and \\"beauty and the beast.\\" disney carried on it's trend with this fun filled adventure.aladdin was truely a great additiion to the disney cannon because of strenght and subtleties.  <br /> <br />the story is well delivered and blends action, and romance briliantly along with comic relief characters that never seem corny or out of place. that seemlessnes keeps this film from becoming too sereous or light hearted.  <br /> <br />the animation is strong yet again. by this point disney was beginning to experiment with computer animation and what it could do. that helped the film imensley. the film's animation style itself is highly stylized but it works perfectly here.  <br /> <br />the music ties it all together and is just as strong as in preveous disney films. all these increadable elements come together to form a solid entertaining film. it isn't disney greatest of their modern four hits, but it holds up nicely and is quite impressive. it is definately, definately worth owning. <br /> <br />
B000FVQYYK|3.0|I've been a fan of Muse for almost eight years now, scarfing up every release, sometimes shelling out big bucks (my copy of Origins was 35$USD or so.)  I was waiting on pins and needles for this release, and after listening through the album a good deal, I must say this is a far cry from the Muse I love.  Gone are the beautiful songs that blew my socks off nigh immediately, these have been replaced with mediocre melodies and lyrics.  Muse used to be seething with some of the \\"darker\\" emotions (excellent examples: Citizen Erased, Hate This & I'll Love You, Blackout), but it feels a bit like they're trying to let that go.  Starlight was a dreadful waste of a track, too pop/mushy sounding for the band.  Not to say all the songs are a waste, Exo-Politics and City of Delusion are wonderful, and are much more like the older albums.  Overall, I would not recommend this album to someone new to the band.  It's probably been said, but this is a release for the fans, and it barely even meets THAT bill.  It even seems that there are less piano-driven tracks on this release as well.  Overall, a let-down.
B000F8O35U|5.0|looking back, it's hard for me to think of a time when disney didn't rain supremem in the world of family oriented animated features. but most will generally agree that the sixties, seventies, and eighties proved to be a dark time for the company. after walt's death, the company slid and the animation that it had been built on slided into what can only be, at best, called medeocraty. by 1989, all hope for the animation department rested on one motion picture, the little mermaid.    the little mermaid would prove to be a phenominal movie that signified a rebirth in disney animation that would last well into the mid-to-late 1990's. but how did this one movie pull it all off? easy, mermaid features a brilliant blend of great animation, a great story, great performances, and oscar-winning music.    the animation itself is rich and alive. the characters are all given great details that make them feel much more alive. the colors are bold and rich, not bland or monochromatic like in other disney efforts. the backgrounds are all amazingly brilliant and provide a great look at life under the sea from their colors as well combined with their startling detail. the combination of these elements provide an experience that is, for the first time in many years, magical.    the use of another fairy tail seems to serve the company well yet again. many liberties are naturally taken to give the piece a happier ending than the original story. the additional characters and character development make for a great movie as well. from the zaniness of scuttle, to the delightful wickedness of ursula, these are some great characters that lead to a great picture.    a lot of the greatness of those characters is owed to the performances, and wow. jodi benson as ariel may only be heard for the first half of the movie, but her moving performance is a definitive leading lady. pat carroll as ursula is perfect. her voice is nothing short of perfect. and no one can forget samuel e wright as the greatjamaican crab. these performers all bring life that the animated movie needs to work.    the music is absolutely stunning. i wont go into much detail, for that u can read my review of the soundtrack. but the great thing about all these songs is that they all progress the story brilliantly, just as a proper musical should. it was helpful to have a broadway team here to provide the six songs rather than a pop duo or performer provide one or two lifeless tracks.    everything about this movie is fun, fresh, and everyhting a great family movie should be. the characters, performers, and songs all bring a life and freedom that is really great to see. there's a reason why this signaled a return to form for the walt disney company. a true timeless classic.
0596009208|5.0|Java was the first programming language I learned and Head First Java was the first book I used to try and learn it. I found it funny and engaging but, more importantly, the topics stuck in my mind and I learnt the basics fast. <br /> <br />As this was the first programming book I had used, I was assuming that all books would be this easy to use. However, other java books are tedious, vague and confusing in comparison. I soon abandoned them and returned to Head First. <br /> <br />If I had to make a critisism of the book, then it would be that in the first chapter, there is a lot to take in and you may need to re-read it a few times before you move on but other than that  <br />I found the book excellent.
1592401791|4.0|This is a fine book but a book that's almost fatally compromised by bias. It's great that Emerick worshipped Paul McCartney, adored him, fawned over him and lapped up any tiny amount of attention Macca paid to him. It's Geoff's right to have had a favorite Beatle (hey, most of us do). But I object most strenuously to the character assassination of George Harrison, which weaves in and out of the narrative like a bad acid trip.<br /><br />I've read hundreds of books about the Beatles, many of which were written by insiders. Dislike of George is nowhere to be found in all these other accounts, and \\"dislike\\" is the correct word to apply regarding Geoff's feelings for Harrison. The reader is repeatedly treated to Emerick's constant derision for George's \\"ham-fisted guitar playing,\\" or his \\"agonizingly bad attempt at a solo.\\" He mentions this at least 30 times in the book. He registers total surprise on the two occasions when George is able to whip out a 4-bar solo without flubbing it. He depicts George as a torturously inept guitarist and makes plain that Paul's guitar work was vastly superior. He also bends over backwards to let the reader know that George and John's occasional attempts to play bass (Paul's instrument), were anemic at best.<br /><br />I agree that Paul was a better guitarist than George and obviously the songwriting team of Lennon-McCartney eclipsed anything Harrison could come up with. A gentle reminder of these facts would have sufficed. Instead Emerick takes a sledgehammer to batter us with constant references to Harrison's musical ineptitude. It becomes quite tedious after a few hundred pages. We get the message!<br /><br />Emerick also makes many nasty asides about George as a human being: he was sullen, mean, caustic, unfunny and an extremely untalented songwriter. The \\"I hate George\\" refrain becomes a drag after awhile. Geoff calls many of George's songs \\"dirges\\" and makes plain that neither he, George Martin, nor the rest of the Beatles could keep their eyes open whenever George rehearsed one of his songs.<br /><br />Geoff's distaste for Ringo is almost as prominent, and he dismisses Ringo as \\"stupid,\\" \\"dim-witted\\" and a lug who sits behind his drum kit reading comic books, contributing virtually nothing to the group. He claims that Ringo was a terrible singer who \\"could barely sing a note.\\" Whenever Ringo produces brilliance on the drums, Geoff takes all the credit because he placed a spot mike by Ringo's high hat, or because he stuffed towels into the bass drum to achieve a muffled effect. Incredibly, he makes these judgment calls after admitting he never once had a conversation with the tactiturn drummer.<br /><br />John Lennon comes off a wee bit better, though there's no affection there either. Geoff is almost grudging in his praise of \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" and if you can't muster praise for that song, it's pretty hopeless. He despised \\"Revolution\\" and trashes \\"I am the Walrus\\" at every opportunity. He goes into rhapsodies over Paul songs like \\"Blackbird\\" or \\"A Fool on the Hill\\" and dismisses \\"Walrus\\" in a single paragraph brimming with criticism.<br /><br />All of the love is poured in copious amounts upon the adorable head of Paul, who is unbearably talented, sweet, kind, a better musician that the other three combined. Emerick insists Paul knew more about conducting an orchestra than George Martin himself. According to Emerick, Paul was the real leader of the Beatles, the only one who cared about music and most importantly, the only Beatle who ever gave him the time of day. It's obvious this last point is the salient one for Geoff.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest inaccuracy is that Emerick believes that the Beatles really were only a vehicle for Paul (and to a lesser extent, John), to show their genius. He openly states that George and Ringo were pawns, utterly unimportant in the scheme of things, and session musicians could easily have filled their place. It's amazing that someone who worked so closely with the group could make such a demonstrably assinine, ill-informed remark.<br /><br />Despite all the negativity in the book, it's a plethora of new, exciting details about the Beatles making music. There's no doubt that this is an incredibly important primary account, far better than George Martin's writings about the boys. Emerick's chapters on Revolver and Sgt. Pepper are the highlight of the book. He spends several pages on the making of \\"A Day in The Life\\" which is worth the price of the book alone. His insights into the stuffy and button-down George Martin are also funny and insightful. On the few occasions that Martin was absent, the Beatles were able to goof around and let loose on fun songs like \\"Yellow Submarine\\" or \\"All Together Now.\\"<br /><br />Emerick could have delved more into drug use by the Beatles, but aside from telling a few dreary stories about John using acid, there's not much there. His character portraits of the Beatles are also minimal. A reader knowing nothing about the group would come away despising Harrison, thinking Ringo was a cretin, Paul a genius and John an eccentric hanger-oner. Yoko flits in and out, but Emerick's stories about her contain nothing new or especially interesting.<br /><br />It's essential reading for any Beatles fan, but the hateful tone towards George and the pandering to Paul makes it a sometimes uncomfy read.ely with the group could make such a demonstrably assinine, ill-informed remark.<br /><br />Despite all the negativity in the book, it's a plethora of new, exciting details about the Beatles making music.

0671015206|4.0|For someone like myself (who used to buy everything and anything), this book was an eye opener.  Yes this book might not be for everyone but I laugh at the people who write there is nothing to be learned from this book.  That statement says everything I need to know about them. There is something to be learned from EVERYthing...its just a matter of how you apply it to your own life.  Since I started applying disciplines in this book and others, I have been exponentially happier with my life.  Its amazing how we come to believe that we need the new sports car.  Commercialism has ingrained it into us that we cant be happy without a big car payment or house we can barely afford with an interest only mortgage.  Do you have to live like a pauper as other reviewers suggest? Of course not, its all about who you are and how you apply the principles to your own life.  This book doesnt try to change who you are, it does exactly what it advertised....gives insight into the quiet millionaires among us and how they got there.

B0009I7O7A|3.0|I loved that they also released this album in 5.1 surround, but I was expecting the mixes to be similar to the ones on \\"Heavier Things\\". <br /> <br />It starts great until it reaches \\"Neon\\". Seems to me that some elements of the song are missing (or mixed way too low), like a synth that you hear on the chorus (of the stereo mix). <br />And 3x5 is even more weird, with a two-note plucking acoustic guitar loop that is (intentionally) burried on the stereo mix here is mixed louder on one of the sides and it's distracting.  <br /> <br />I still think it's worth buying because of the songs that DON'T sound strange on the surround mix and the video bonus.

B000002IHD|5.0|I don't know if \\"Otis Blue\\" is the greatest 60s soul record ever released, as some have suggested, but I'm convinced it must be in the top-10.   \\"Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul\\" is a bit brief by today's standarts, and I do prefer the Stones' own version of \\"Satisfaction\\" to this one, but virtually every thing else is terrific. The arrangements are lean and uncluttered but suitably muscular, and Otis Redding was not the least of the many fine vocalists of soul's \\"golden age\\".    Redding is equally convincing on slow, gospel-like tunes like \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" and up-tempo soul stompers like \\"Respect\\", and he receives excellent backing by guitarist Steve Cropper and a tight four-man horn ensemble (two trumpets, two saxes).  Highlights include almost every song. A gritty, grinding \\"Down In The Valley\\", a rarely-compiled cover of Sam Cooke's \\"Wonderful World\\", the aching ballad \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\", and \\"Shake\\", a driving dance-friendly party tune. Whether or not the blues classic \\"Rock Me Baby\\" benefits from this arrangement depends on how you feel about blues to begin with, I guess, but Steve Cropper's playing is certainly very good.    Some of Otis Redding's best self-penned songs are here, like \\"Ole Man Trouble\\" and the aforementioned \\"Respect\\" and \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\", and while a good case can be made for the \\"Dock Of The Bay\\" being Redding's best original album, I think this one deserves a tie at least.  \\"Otis Blue\\" should not be missing from any self-respecting soul collection. Music collection, really.   It's got a beat and you can dance to it. Ot just sit there alternately swaying and bopping your head like a deranged pigeon.
B00005JP7M|4.0|Of Woody Allen's output in the past twenty-five years, SCOOP is among his more lightly intended efforts.  If all too often during that time Woody has been more auteur than entertainer, here he is almost pure entertainer.  He basically is just trying to give us a good time and for the most part he succeeds.  This is not among his best films, but it is easily one of his most enjoyable of recent years.  Most of the audience comments I overheard upon leaving the preview showing in Chicago were very favorable.<br /><br />SCOOP is one of Woody's odder films in that it is an unusual blend of supernatural fantasy, whodunit (or, rather, did-he-du-it), and romantic comedy.  I won't divulge many plot details except that a newly dead journalist (played by Ian McShane) learns the identity of a serial killer from another newly dead person and determined to pull off one last scoop communicates the information to a young American journalism student (and former dental hygienist--giving rise to many excellent tooth jokes) visiting a friend in London.  The student (played by Scarlett Johansson) elicits the helps of a ham stage magician (Woody), who aids her in her investigation by posing as her father.  The other major cast member is Peter Lyman (played by the remarkable Hugh Jackman, who despite the ire of Dr. Cox on SCRUBS, is one of the most versatile and talented individuals in the movies).<br /><br />This is not a deep movie, but it was not intended as such.  The point is clearly to have a good time, laugh a lot, and enjoy watching Woody spin his tale.  Not all the jokes are funny, but they are plentiful and many of them hit home.  Apart from some astonishingly unfunny one-liners (though, again, many are quite good--though I have to add that if I were to compile a list of the one hundred best Woody Allen one-liners, probably none from the film would make this list), my one real complaint with the film is that the initial set up of the film is handled in cursory fashion.  We aren't really told how or why Ian McShane is able to reappear briefly in the land of the living.  It just happens.  In this way, the film at times just doesn't feel very polished or finished.<br /><br />The cast, as in virtually all Woody Allen films, is excellent.  I am not a huge Scarlett Johansson fan, but I thought she was delightful in this.  Most of her films have been rather serious in tone, but I wonder if comedy might not suit her better.  Hugh Jackman is, as always, superb.  My one complaint with his being in the X-MEN movies is that it has kept him from exploring a variety of roles.  I really have no idea what his limits are.  He has excelled in action and comedy.  He has made no film musicals, but he is a highly accomplished veteran of the musical theater.  Not matter what he undertakes he seemingly pulls it off without effort.  Woody was basically Woody as Sid Waterman aka Splendini.  Many roles he has undertaken have been either hard-to-believe or otherwise unsuited for his physique or talent, but this one is perfect.  McShane is a truly amazing actor, but he is underutilized here in what is really a very small, if crucial, part.  As a BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER fan, I have to mention a very brief appearance near the end of the film of Anthony Stewart Head (Buffy's Watcher Rupert Giles) as a police inspector.<br /><br />I think this film will please most Woody Allen fans and even many nonfans will enjoy it.  If I had to compare it to a previous film, it would most fairly compare to SMALL TIME CROOKS.  Both are nonambitious efforts to simply entertain.  I think SCOOP is the more successful of the two films.  I certainly encourage fans to check this out and see for themselves.w or why Ian McShane is able to reappear briefly in the land of the living.  It just happens.

0553573403|5.0|WOW!  Such a fantastic job with this book!  Absolutely thrilling adventure!  I never thought that someone would go beyond the impossible...which is to make the impossible mainly NOT HAPPEN!  I was engaged with every page of the book.<br /><br />What's different with this book than any other fantasy literature?  This story is mainly REAL LIFE!  While other fantasies usually have black or white for their characters, Martin has the varying shades of gray distributed with every character, making it hard to distinguish good from bad (except perhaps with some of the Starks and some of the Lannisters).  Yet, you WILL be cheering for someone in this book.  However, my two favorite characters in this book got killed off.  After coming from many fantasies where the hero is triumphant, this was a shocker.  Now I expect anything and everything from Mr. Martin.<br /><br />My three favorite characters now, though, are Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, and Daenaerys Targaryen.  Jon has his conflicting loyalties which is something I like to see in developing fantasy teens.  Tyrion (why does everyone love to HATE him?) has his \\"charms\\" and his witticisms (which are HILARIOUS).  Daenaerys (Dany) has her strength of will and motivation of vengeance for her family.  Tyrion, however, is probably my FAVORITE favorite because he is someone who, despite his size (sometimes), commands enormous respect, as well he should.  He has stockfuls of gold.  Also, aside from his humor, he is cunning and I love cunning people in books (except for Cersei Lannister, his witch of a sister).<br /><br />I really didn't like Sansa or Catelyn Stark until near the end of each of their own stories.  Catelyn was a bit too untrusting (plus she captured my favorite character because of that).  But, once she was reunited with Robb Stark, her character developed.  Sansa was just a whiny little girl who wanted nothing more than Prince Joffrey.  *faint*  FINALLY, for her last segment of the book, she realized what you-know-what Joffrey was.  She wised up and never trusted the Lannisters again.<br /><br />Brandon Stark had so much going for him, but then...read the book.  Still, I think Bran will still have a big part to play (unless unpredictable Mr. Martin kills him off).<br /><br />As for the critics saying it's too much with the raping and language and violence, GET OVER IT!  These things happened in the Middle Ages.  For crying out loud, they LIVED for these things!  Even the incestuous relationship in there was practiced in royal families (mainly kings and queens, etc.).<br /><br />I am thoroughly pleased with the prodigious efforts of Mr. Martin.  He did not fail to deliver.  I am going to get those other books with great haste.  Well done, George.u-know-what Joffrey was.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko is perhaps one of the greatest, if not the greatest, independent films in history.  A story of the choices we make everyday and their relations to divine intervention, Donnie Darko lives up to every expectation I have had to compare it to and leaves the viewer wishing for more. <br /> <br />When a plane engine crashes through the house of the Darko family, Donnie's life is spared by a hallucination.  After a six-foot-tall bunny rabbit calls Donnie out to a golf course and tells him that the world will end in 28 days, Donnie realizes that he would have died had it not been for the strange awakening.  What is happening to Donnie?  Of course, you will have to see the movie to find out. <br /> <br />The very powers that created this film - such names as Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze, and Jake Gylenhaal - don't ruin it at all due to their Hollywood status, but instead are able to shine in a movie such as this.  It really shows the true range of emotions these actors can portray without the sugar-coating of a Hollywood production. <br /> <br />The extended scenes and extras on this DVD are well worth it for fans and newcomers to this movie.  Not only does it add more drama and family connection, making the eventual climax much sadder, but it also adds more depth to the characters.  My only regret with this film is that they did not shorten Drew Barrymore's lines during her character's main scene, in which she is fired from the school in which she teaches. <br /> <br />The music and composition in this movie is excellent.  I personally prefer the tracks from the original theatrical debut, but the director's true intentions for the songs in this version do not interfere with the story at all. <br /> <br />Richard Kelly shines as director for this film, showing a depth and creativity rarely seen in movies anymore.  The success of this movie is his own doing, and hopefully Kelly will produce more films like Donnie Darko in the future.
B000G03RJA|4.0|Stop-Press! We finally have a proper Laura Branigan CD collection. I previously reviewed the \\"Best of Branigan\\" with lots of complaints about the chosen tracks. This one, however gets it right. Now all of the important singles are here along with the good material from Laura's best albums (the middle period of her career). So we finally get the fantastic \\"Satisfaction\\" acknowledged as a hit, and the unnecessary cover versions of Maria McKee's \\"Show Me Heaven\\" and Donna Summer's \\"Dim All The Lights\\" have been deservedly dropped. I'm not saying Laura does not sing the songs well, but they are not her hits by any stretch. And they are also really bland, AOR productions. Shame we still have to put up with her version of Jennifer Rush's \\"The Power of Love\\"...was this actually a hit for her? The original is really Rush's trademark performance and should be left that way.<br /><br />But I'm not averse to all her covers, in fact it's a hard term to use fairly with a singer like Branigan, who is first and foremost a vocalist, and her whole career has been based around interpretations of other people's songs. So let's not forget that she merely imported English language versions of \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Self Control\\" from their original Italian origins...however in these two cases she did a fabulous job. Songs like these  she makes the definitive version of, that's why I want to see them gathered on a CD collection, rather than the bland interpretations of the ones I mention up above.<br /><br />It's also great to see other strong tracks like \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\" (the Carole King number, a lovely version) and \\"If You Loved Me\\". Then there are also the other moderately successful singles like \\"Ti Amo\\" and \\"Spanish Eddie\\", so the package is a much more fully-rounded one than previous Laura Branigan CD compilations.<br /><br />I'd still like to see the good tracks from \\"Hold Me\\" (a flop album for some unfathomable reason) re-appraised, as it's full of some very strong tracks, easily comparable to those on the \\"Self Control\\" album.

B0002NRRAG|1.0|Do you love ripoff artists such as Lenny Kravitz and Norah Jones? Does true originality disturb you and drive you to seek cover in the soft womb of corporate created fluff marketed as the real deal?  Then you're in for a treat with this album! Not even Rich Little could do Billie better.  Texture of voice AND delivery expertly stolen without a qualm, but without any of the icky sincerity and authentic pain of the original. Enjoy!
B000002UAR|5.0|Each year, sometime between January and March, safely tucked in from howling Michigan winds, I start to calculate the amount the IRS will strongarm from me if I don't tearfully turn it over.  During this painful process, I will either sing (thankfully, I live alone) or play George Harrison's \\"Taxman\\" from \\"Revolver\\"....that witty, spot-on spoof that reminds us that in modern democracies, no good deed from our brightest, best, most productive, and even most charitable (at least in Mr. Harrison's case) citizenry goes unpunished.<br /><br />Of course, \\"Taxman\\" is only the first earthly delight in the Revolver garden. In fact, although the following argument could be made for each Beatle LP from Rubber Soul afterward, I believe it was  \\"Revolver\\"  which caught them at the height of their talent, energy, and their synthesis as a team.<br /><br />This was at the  beginning, for example, of drug experimentation; and John was still very much involved with the band's day to day doings, and hadn't yet \\"tuned in and dropped out\\".  \\"Rain\\", \\"Dr. Robert\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" (which has one of the most interesting chord progressions I've ever heard,  although John is said to have thought it was junk) and \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" are all clearly John's songs.  \\"Dr. Roberts\\" (said to be about a dentist who supplied the boys with either LSD or nitrous oxide),  has a disdainful, biting tone about it. \\"She Said, She Said\\", which all sources, including Lennon's interviews, cite as a transcript of a conversation with Peter Fonda in which Peter, stoned, told John, \\"I know what it's like to be dead,\\" and John felt a little freaked out and dreadfully sorry for him (although, one would imagine, somewhat stoned himself at the time).  Although there are clearly positive references from Lennon regarding use of alternative means to achieve states of euphoria, it is just as clear he is putting out signs he is not a little ambivalent about it.<br /><br />In Revolver, George is beginning to chomp at the bit as a mature composer and arranger, especially with the amount he's influenced the others. After all, John used the sitar George has introduced them to in \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" for example.  I've mentioned \\"Taxman\\"; George gets not the standard two dogbones thrown to him on this lp but *three*; \\"Love You To\\" and \\"I Want to Tell You\\" complete the tryptich.  \\"LYT\\" is a masterpiece, that makes one wonder if anyone  will ever again be able to pair Indian classical sounds (or what sound to Western ears like Indian classical sounds) with Western pop music structure as well as Harrison.  \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is a rocker with a universality proved in that the first big cover of it was made by Ted Nugent.<br /><br />Paul continues to wax experimental here too.  We have another string quartet (as in \\"Yesterday\\") in \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" (named after a name on a grave found back home in Liverpool). \\"For No One\\" ends on a seeking, open chord and also has a classical influence.  But probably the most beautiful McCartney offering on the LP is \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\", a ballad that evokes courtly love or a window serenade from a bard who cannot live without his lady fair.<br /><br />Last but not least (on the UK CD...you'll have to get the US one to get \\"Got to Get You Into My Life\\") is \\"Yellow Submarine\\", the song that launched a thousand headaches for the band, albeit at least one more good song, \\"Hey Bulldog.\\"  And hey, *we* love it!<br /><br />But while you're listening to this great piece of Beatle history, be sure to study the cover.  It was designed by no less than Klaus Voorman....the ex-boyfriend of Astrid Kuchherr, who designed the Beatles' haircuts in Hamburg, Germany.  Klaus never lost touch and when they needed a great idea, he gave them such a good one, it won them a Grammy for best lp design!

B00006JKOM|4.0|Some Tull fans may think I'm crazy, but I really enjoy this album. This has never been a very popular record, but plain and simple the musicianship is excellent overall, ranging from the intricate accoustic guitar intro on \\"Salamander\\", to the sing-along chorus of \\"Big Dipper\\" which has a very infectious beat supplied by Barrie Barlow. This was the first Tull album to feature talented bass guitarist Jon Glasscock, who really had a unique style and came up with some unique bass lines if you listen closely. I think my favorite track is the last one (Chequered Flag) which has some really touching lyrics and breathtaking moments. For anybody who has lived in a big city, then you will chuckle at the amusing lyrics on \\"Taxi Grab.\\" Overall, this is a concept album about a 1950s greaser trying to reclaim his youthful days...a theme that is still relevant today as many from the 60s and 70s generation (my parents included) are trying to feel young again by listening to classic rock on the radio. Oh well, I guess I'll be doing the same thing when I turn 50! This record is definitely underrated in the Tull discography and the extra tracks on this cd are worth hearing. The strip cartoon inside is also pretty funny. Pick this one up. It's grand!

B00002E224|1.0|I enjoy unusual movies and wanted to like this movie. The basic structure of the movie, which several other reviewers have complained about, did not \\"bore\\" me or disappoint me. The movie is essentially about two people having a long conversation one night after meeting on a train.<br /><br />The problem for me was the content of the conversation. I've read that a fair portion of the dialog was improvised and perhaps that was part of the problem. The content of the conversation seems to be the inexperienced and shallow observations of two twenty-somethings who are fairly cynical. What some people feel was \\"wit\\", I felt was cliched and trite. For instance, at one point, Ethan Hawke's character says that he feels married people who are happy lie to one another all the time. If we knew more about his character's past up to this point and could see that there was some negative experience behind his cynicism, the statement might offer us a chance to empathize with and understand his character. Given the lack of information about his motives for such a statement and his age, I can only see him as another Hollywood character making flip comments about marriage in an attempt to show how much smarter they are about the true state of things than the rest of the world.<br /><br />It wasn't merely this one statement that was a problem. The dialogue in general is not very well-paced or interesting. The characters, because they are so smug in their assertions, are not very likeable. Also, there seems to be very little on-screen chemistry between Delpy and Hawke. I couldn't buy that these two people were irresistably drawn to each other. I particularly couldn't buy Delpy spending a day with a stranger who was often brash, rude and dismissive of her behavior.<br /><br />Perhaps this concept would have worked better with two actors with a genuine rapport and physical connection. As it is, I truly regret spending the money on this DVD.
B00005Y7KX|4.0|I was not lucky enough to see the original production of this show.  But, after listening to the 2 CD version over and over again, I finally bought this.<br /><br />It's a wonderful show.  I do think some of the camera work wasn't great.  For instance, the acrobats and dancers are an integral part of this show.  They aren't clear here, and are not given equal camera time here.  I have heard this show is similar to Cirque de Soleil's shows, but it's impossible to see this when viewing the DVD.<br /><br />Some of the criticism with this show was that the storyline isn't completely clear.  I don't find this to be the case, but I'm familiar with the story.  I do think most of it is clear, and viewing the show made me love the music all the more.  All of the characters (save Esmeralda, who I'll get to in a minute) are multi-dimensional and, in the 1 1/2 hour showtime, you really get a feel for the anguish these people are all going through.  Frollo, in particular, was a real surprise.  Instead of being pure evil, one really sees his mental torture.  He's even sympathetic at times, except you know all along he will do the wrong thing and cause death and destruction at the end.<br /><br />Garou (Quasimodo) and Daniel Lavoie (Frollo) are just EXCELLENT.  Lavoie's voice is amazing.  Patrick Fiori (Phoebus) has a gorgeous tenor.  They are all just a pleasure to listen to and watch. Bruno Pelletier, in his role as Gringoire, is perfect.<br /><br />Fleur de Lys (Julie Zenatti) is wonderful in her small role.<br /><br />The only real problem I had with the casting was Esmeralda.  Her voice is beautiful and she conveys the right emotion in the music.  However, part of the problem with this show is that she is supposed to be a gypsy who dances most sensually.  It's talked about over and over again. . . the men literally become transfixed watching her. . .mesmerized.  We never get to see her dance. Ever. She walks around stiffly and doesn't really move sensually at all.  In one of the first numbers she has, \\"Bohemienne\\", there is a point where she raises her hands as if she will go into a gypsy dance, but then she doesn't.  And, this is a bit of a let down.  Is this the director's fault? Is this because Helene Segara cannot dance at all?  If she can't dance, then they really needed to show a gypsy dance with one of the cast dancers playing Esmeralda for the interval.  This one thing was noticeable enough for me to reduce the 5 stars this show would have received to the four that I gave it.<br /><br />Also, I thought Helene Segara was made up to look a bit too old for the part. There was just so much makeup, that she didn't look young and innocent. She looked older and harder-- although she is supposed to be young and innocent and unaware of her beauty and the effect she has on those around her.  She IS beautiful, yes.  But, she she doesn't carry off the innocence at all visually.  Noa, who sang Esmeralda on the CD version of this, visually could have carried off the role of Esmeralda even though she's less \\"classically\\" beautiful.  She's more lithe and dark and has that sensuous body movement that Helene Segara lacks.<br /><br />Regardless of my criticism here, this is an excellent show and one worth having on DVD.the first numbers she has, \\"Bohemienne\\", there is a point where she raises her hands as if she will go into a gypsy dance, but then she doesn't.

B000BJS4SU|5.0|My exposure to John Mayer was limited but after seeing him perform \\"Daughters\\" live on TV, I started to notice. This album is, for lack of better explanation, excellent! The more I listen to this album, the more I start to think there's some damn good talent, songwriting, musicianship and God help us, feeling! SRV type feeling! Yes, it's that good! \\"Vultures\\", \\"Good Love\\", \\"Gravity\\" are amazing tracks with \\"Another Kind of Green\\" being the best track on the disc by far! The only downside I can see is the teeny-booper fans may not \\"get it\\" and the blues fans may be turned off by the name \\"John Mayer\\". Do yourself a favor, buy it. Extra points for appearing on Chapelle's Show!

B000002O1Q|5.0|After reading and agreeing with the majority of the reviews for this soundtrack, I noticed no one mentioned the movie it belongs to. Plenty of action, romance, adventure and drama, this movie is brilliant as well!
B00005JOML|4.0|I went to threads for the movie where a lot of people had it planned to hate it before it even came out. So the one star reviews I see here don't really surprise me. They knocked the casting from the start and I admit I also had a problem with Colin Farrell and Jamie Fox being casted. They look nothing like the original actors or even try to sound like them here. Still I can't say they are bad. Farrell gives a kickass performance either way even if he doesn't have Don Johnson's charm. I can't say that Farrell and Fox even have Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas chemestry. While their relationship with Lt. Martin Castillo here is disapointing as well. They barely even like the guy and curse at him every time they see him.<br /><br />  Farrell however has really good chemestry with Li Gong. His relationship with her is at least faithful to the show. I mean Johnson's Crockett was always falling for girls when he was undercover. Plus they also have a sexy and cool scene on a speed boat that's faithful to the tone of the show. The shootouts are also faithful to the show even if they are a bit more violent. The show had it's romantic steamy sex scenes and so does this movie. Fox and Farrell both have shower scenes where they share the shower with a woman. Which probably weren't even needed.<br /><br />  The look of the film is  faithful since Mann who produced the show directs here and since most of his films are little Miami Vicesish. I was hoping to at least hear the original theme music once or twice but that never happens. I forgive it for that though since I am a Michael Mann fan and was a Michael Mann fan longer than I was a Miami Vice fan. I just got into the show recently with the dvds. While Heat was one of my favorite movies for awhile. If you liked Heat and Collateral then you should also like this movie. Die hard Vice fans probably won't be as crazy about it.<br /><br />  Crockett and Tubbs are hardly even buddy buddy in the film, they are partners and that's about it. I wouldn't mind sequels so everyone could develop a little more. How about Elizabeth Rodriguez getting more screen time as Gina. I wouldn't mind seeing her develop a relationship with Crockett like she had in the show \\"although I think they only slept together once in the first episode lol\\". Here they hardly even talk unless they are working together to bust or kill some bad guys. The movie is just all undercover stuff mostly and you hardly get to know them as people when they aren't undercover. This isn't a bad movie but I don't think it works if they only have one movie and that's it. It leaves you thinking of it as a pilot episode that has you waiting for more episodes....People knock how it's slow and not too much like the show but think about it. They go undercover, deal with bad guys and there's a shootout at the end....sounds like the show to me. Just don't expect music by U2 and Phil Collins or some annoying guy named Noogie.bout it.

B000FVQYYK|4.0|Don't get me wrong, this album is fantastic...expect from track 2-6.  <br />Supermassive Black Hole is the most obvious example of that techno, dance grove. It's ok the first listen, but I definately skip that track most of the time.  <br />Map of the Problematique, again, same problem. A little to electronica, and overdramatic to a point. It crosses into the \\"New Age\\" to a point. <br />Soldier's Poem, funny song, great to relax too but doesn't belong on here.  <br />Invincible has none of the flaws from above, but it suffers from cheesy lyrics for the first couple of minutes. It begins to pickup around 2:30, but I tend to skip it. <br />Other than those, the album has great energy,l yrics and an epic atmosphere about it..It's almost like a rock opera, waiting to be discovered.

B00062ZE3U|4.0|People are very opinionated over this album and either applauad the new direction or bash it for what they see as unoriginal tripe Americanized Pop-Gothic Metal. It is, however, very clear that this is not the same band mentally that released Mother Earth not that long ago. The lyrics are more introspective and less about fantastical settings that tell a story. Granted songs such as Our Farewell and Restless from their previous efforts have had a degree of inward focus, but the focus now seems to neither be so deep nor so passionate. Rather, the lyrics, I am said to say, seem rather shallow and much along the lines of what a distraught teen would write while contemplating the despair of their lives when they sit in third period. I will admit that the lyrics on Mother Earth were at times so fantastical as to be almost comical, but they at least showed thought and an attempt to convey originally a concept that the band felt worth telling. In reality, the lyrics of Mother Earth showed honesty in such a way that this album does not. Within Temptation is more talented at creating a scenic audioscape of fantasy using nature based archtypes of beauty and mystery that inspire feeling than they are at recycling the same vapid themes of internal self-loathing and loss that every other \\"dark\\" band out there feels the need to address. In all sincerity, you simply do not feel that the band is being honest on this album. It feels to the listener that there should be something there at the least that is driving these feelings of wanting to overcome, or wanting to stand up for yourself. However, it is blantantly clear that in the album's words that there is no substance behind these feelings. The words while at first seeming strong in essence lack any substance, and the listener is left with the question of why does it seem that these sounds ring hollow? Why does it seem like Within Temptation has become more about image than substance? <br /> <br />Ok, perhaps I am going a bit hard on the lyrics, but it would seem that the music itself has become more image oriented as well. The allusion has been made here already to Evanescence and I can see where they are coming from. I have everything that Within Temptation has released and I can see what they mean when that is said. However, while I am no admirer of this newly polished sound, I do respect a band's right and need to evolve. I simply feel that they have left behind many of the assets that made them earn the reputation they have in the Gothic and Symphonic Metal world. Sharon den Adel's voice is not allowed to be as far ranging nor as haunting of a presence as on previous releases. The former releases also seemed to feature more experimentation as far as song structure is concerned. Also, because the earlier releases were less studio polished in sound they seemed to exhibit the band better for who they are and less for what they could be made to sound like. The instruments were more on the center stage and the effects of a producer tweaking the music was less obvious. <br /> <br />I still give the album four stars because I can respect it for what it is. I have moments where I do want to hear this album. Sometimes all I want is what this CD has to offer. Generic tortured soul lyrics with a very polished symphonic gothic sound. And that's ok. I have to be in the mood for it, and if you have moods where that is what you want then by all means get this album. I have it and I am glad that I do. For me personally, however, I was disappointed with the change that this album marked in the Within Temptation sound. I feel that it was inferior compared to what they are capable of. I think they did not put their full potential in, but I also know that this album cen be just what I feel like hearing when I am in a mood to just have some not that thought provoking music on. This album is just what you make of it. It has a place for me and maybe it will for you too.
0679422714|2.0|This poorly written book presents Mao as a ruthless imbecile who became the monstrous ruler of around one billion people. Ruthless and monstrous he may have been, but how an imbecile could have achieved this is beyond me. <br /> <br />That Mao was rather a bad man is not really news. One redeeming feature of Jung Chang's book is that it might lead readers to better, and less vitriolic accounts of this great tyrants life. There are many better books on the subject. Ross Terrill's biographies of Mao, and his wife Jiang Qing, \\"The White Boned Demon\\" are both quite good. Also highly recommended are \\"Life and Death in Shanghai\\" by Nien Cheng, and \\"The Private Life of Chairman Mao\\", by Li Zhi-Sui. <br /> <br />Whether  or not any of these books will have a lasting or positive effect upon humanity is highly unlikely as I think there will always be populations subject to rule of despots. It's the nature of life. It has always happened, and is happening right now in many parts of the world.

George Bush acts like war is a game and he treats people as guinea pigs to test his new weaponary. He should try and sleep where the bombs fall, its not easy. Rage agaisnt the machine was a great band, musically and non-musically. If we listened to them in 1992 maybe 9/11 wouldnt of happened.

'In The Zone' is a diverse, eclectic mix of work, revealing a more mature and sexual Spears.

B000002KZT|4.0|This is what thrash metal is all about. There are a lot of fan favorites on here that are still performed live to this day. Angel of Death is perhaps one of Slayer's most infamous and brutal tunes. Note how they do not condone nor condemn the Nazi madman. They are like reporters, they just tell it like it is (or how it was). Yes Slayer is a dark musical journey and you have to take it with a grain of salt. I don't believe that Slayer are devil worshippers, nor do I believe they are influnenced by demons as a fellow reviewer stated. They are just being Slayer. They right fast agressive thrash and their 'gimmick' is evil. Pure and simple.<br /><br />Reign in Blood ranks as one of the finest and most influential thrash/speed metal albums of all time.
B000GDH9JQ|4.0|I have been waiting a long time for this to be available on DVD.  I saw it on cable and now I look for it every time that it is on.   <br />So it isn't the most critically acclaimed movie ever made.  Who cares?  Seeing the dancing is reason enough.  Everyone here has made much of the opening sequence, which is VERY good, but my favorite has to be the sequence with both dancers together.   <br /> <br />I think Gregory Hines rocks, and I personally am looking forward to the day that TAP is ever put on DVD.
B00005V0X5|4.0|This album is so good, I had the tape for years and bought this remastered CD. Only complaint is the same as everyone elses, the 'These Boots' debauchery. I never cared for the song that much, I thought it was the only low point of the album, but the 'BEEEEEEEP' is incredibly annoying.<br /><br />However the rest of the album is a must have, as is the debuts of the original Big 4 metal bands, the other three being Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax. Last Rites/Loved to Deth kicks this bad boy off on the right track, from a classical piano piece to straight up metal guitar riffs. Favorite song is the title track. Dave is at his angriest and the anger really came off well in the studio. It must have been great to have seen them live at this period.<br /><br />Skull beneath the Skin, Looking down the Cross, and the awesome Vic Rattlehead (the song that introduces their mascot) is enough metal to keep you head 'rattled'.
0876855575|5.0|Bukowski's novels (at least the ones I've read) all put together seem to be one long autobiography.  Although this one was written later, it is the begining of the story, his childhood.  Therefore I would recommend Ham on Rye as the perfect book to start with.  Factotum picks up where Ham on Rye leaves off. Which follows into  Post office and then Women.  By reading them in this order you can follow Henry Chinaski (the main character) from childhood to old age.  I am a big fan of Bukowski's novels although I have nothing in common with Henry Chinaski I completely understand his world-view.  He reminds us that no one goes further than those who start at the botttom.
076531178X|5.0|The immortal Lord Ruler has brutally dominated the Great Houses for over a millennium.  The ash that is everywhere symbolizes his Final Empire rule; the lack of flowers anywhere represents the lack of hope.  No one, purebred Skaa, hybrids, or otherwise, dares even think of rebellion in this vile wasteland if they want to survive another day out side the evil dungeons.<br /><br />That is none until a half-breed common thief Kelsier survives the ordeal of Lord Ruler's imprisonment by losing his mind.  He begins to \\"develop\\" super skills that enable him to do the impossible.  The thief plans to end the evil regime by overthrowing initially the sycophantic cowardly nobles and culminating with the death of the Lord Ruler.  His charisma obtains followers, but his big break occurs when Kelsier meets Skaa street waif Vin, who has the same Mistborn powers that Kelsier learned to use in the torture chambers.  Kelsier arranges for Vin to go undercover within the nobles' Great Houses.  However, the rebel leader fails to comprehend emotions as his female mole falls in love with Prince Elend Venture.<br /><br />MISTBORN, the first book of the Final Empire series, is a terrific coming of age epic fantasy that uses a what if premise in which the Dark Lord killed the good guy hero (the Hobbit or Beowulf loses to the evil adversary), which leads to a fabulous world in which evil rules absolutely evilly.  Vin holds much of the plot together, but Kelsier is the more fascinating character as a Hans Solo type in fantasy land.  The Lord Ruler is out of Tolkien 101, but that is to be expected as the regime the malevolent one built pays homage to the foul sides of The Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000002GQK|5.0|The Moody Blues 1971 album release \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" was recorded at the very peak of the band's unique molodic rock sound and creativity.  Their consistent formula for success continues here, with each band member contributing to songwriting, and singing lead vocals to their own songs.  The opening track \\"Procession\\" (written by all five members) is an mesmerizing journey thru the evolution of communication and music, cross fading nicely into the only classic single to be released from this album, namely Justin Hayward's \\"The Story In Your Eyes\\".  Next cut from flautist Ray Thomas, \\"Our Guessing Game\\", is wonderfully overdubbed with dueling vocals.  John Lodge's \\"Emily's Song\\", written for his daughter when she was born, is very pretty, which gives way to drummer Graeme Edge's great rocker \\"After You Came\\".  Dueling vocals return in the next track in John Lodge's \\"One More Time To Live\\".  I consider the next track \\"Nice To Be Here\\" (written by Thomas) to be one of the best cuts on the album, a whimsical story of different animals in the forest making music with an assorted batch of rustic instruments, like cooking utensils!  Yeah, it may sound corny, but the song is very catchy and effective. Justin Hayward's \\"You Can Never Go Home\\" is classic Hayward vocals and guitar, before mellotronist Michael Pinder's haunting contribution \\"My Song\\" closes out the album.<br /><br />Although recorded years ago with the genius of \\"the 6th Moody\\", Tony Clarke producing this album, \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" wonderfully captures classic music of a bygone era, and sounds as fresh as though it could have recorded yesterday.  Definitely worthy of 5 star status.<br /><br />Now how about nominating The Moody Blues for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame???
B000DZIGDU|4.0|My biggest fear was that this movie would be just another knockoff of Apocalype Now or Platoon, but it really wasn't.  It took a slightly different route, showing more of the politics and and soldiers struggle with everyday military life, not just concentrating on the horrors of war.  This would be more like a Full Metal Jacket, but updated for the new millenium, with a different story line. This didn't deal with the grunts of the military, this dealt with a more elite group, the Snipers.  What do these guys do in their downtime, which appeared to be quite a bit for this subspecialty.  Private Swoff ( Jake Gyllenhaal) is the character that drive the plot and narrates.  This movie is worth watching if you like Full metal Jacket. It does tend to politically slam some of the beurocracy and prior administrations, so if you don't care for that type of movie and are \\"loyal\\" to you commanders, then avoid this movie. I suspect this is likely the same group that would criticize Full Metal Jacket as well.

B000A2RRF4|5.0|This is the greaest concert on dvd I have ever seen. I wasn't born until 1982, way after Michael had begun his solo career. Even I loved this DVD it is a timeless classic. I am a huge Michael Jackson fan.  This dvd is a must have if you love Michael.  In the dvd Michael sings all his number one hits completely.  Micheal is a true one man show.  He sings and dance the entire time.  The dvd is worth every penny and MORE!!! <br />If you are a fan of Micheal or just want to see a great concert this is the DVD to BUY!!! <br />YOU'LL LOVE IT <br />I DID

0307277674|5.0|We truly, like, liked this book and we TOTALLY bought it, like, right the next second we heard Paris Hilton-the Goddess-was reading it. This book is about four girls and a gay guy: Madison, Sophia, Kylie, Aimee and, of course, Christiano aka Kiki. It's a story about this little group of trendsetters and their struggle to find the greatest boutique of all high-fashion boutiques--Da vinci. Here's the story: like, they have to decode the most hidden code of all time. The code is actually the only way you can get, like, IN the shop and it's in a form of a password. But that's not the only catch: they not only have to discover the code, they also must find the shop. And that's the hard part cuz only, like, four people or something know where it is. It could be six feet under somewhere in Egypt or it could be in a zeppelin that takes of,like,only three times a year and has about six people aboard (plus the pilot whose memory will probably be erased after landing or something).The shop is, by the way, named after some not very well known guy that was probably a designer or something and now he's dead and all. Whatever. Oh, wait-we once saw this really old documentary about this guy-we weren't really paying it a lot of attention since Clueless was on at the same time so we were like: Hello? OF COURSE we're gonna watch Clueless again rather then some boring gay guy with a beard the size of Texas (aka J.lo's butt). Anyway. Where were we? Okay, never mind. It's, like, totally cool, you should, like, totally read it and find out if everybody get's their Manolo Blahnik's and Cavalli dresses in the end.<br /><br />Well, ta-ta! Hope you like this little chick-lit miracle!!<br /><br />Hell & Minx xoxoxoxo

B00005JP4U|1.0|Not only does Al Gore own several businesses that are huge polluters here in Tennessee (the reason he didn't even win his own county in 2000 vote), but scientists around the world have said this piece of propaganda has no basis in fact.  In the 70s, we were allegedly in another ice age and now we're into global warming.  One has to wonder who makes the money on all of this tripe.  Maybe one day someone will figure out that everything is cyclical.  What a stupid piece of propaganda this is...and what a politician will do to get his name in the media!
B000AMWIVM|4.0|I am a huge fan of the horror genre, as long as it isn't a monster movie (e.g. A Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Friday the 13th, etc.) and the T.V. spots that were in my market made this film out as a monster movie, so I over looked it when Saw hit theatres fall of 2004. I now regret coming into the Saw fan club late. Thanks to Scary Movie IV, I decided to go ahead and check it out and I absolutely love this film.<br /><br />It progresses a little slow and the acting isn't the best, but what can you expect on a low budget film? Nevertheless it is a very intelligent film and the ending will honestly make you say \\"WOW\\". No one I've ever talked to that has watched this film has been disappointed, and no one has seen the ending coming.<br /><br />This is a first rate horror film that every horror fan, or any fan of a film that has logic and brains, should see.
B00005JOYO|5.0|I have not seen this movie but have been participating on movie forums that are set up to discuss it.  <br /> <br />A movie insider or two have contributed to the debate in these forums by describing what the movie is. From what I've gathered, I have concluded that it is a drama about profound sadness and despair, survival, hope, faith, and the human condition. I want to see this movie.  <br /> <br />Describing myself, I am a skeptic of the official story. When I heard Oliver Stone was directing this movie, I thought that the truth movement was going to get somewhere with the good ol' conspiracy master himself. At first I was disappointed to learn that he forwards no alternate theories to the original. But then found out that he doesn't address the official story either. It is just what these guys went through on 9/11 and it's an important story to know. <br /> <br />Some background, for those who aren't aware, Oliver Stone was born and raised in NYC. If anyone has the right to tell this story, it's Stone.  <br /> <br />I have researched the various theories connected to 9/11 and have never come across Stone's name having an opinion about them one way or another. Watch this movie and search for clues. Pay attention to minor details and see if you can sense a plea for people to open their eyes. Watch when WTC 7 collapses, then come home, do a little research starting from that point forward and draw your own conclusions about what Oliver Stone's agenda is in making this movie and the officers' who have chosen this man to tell their tale.
B000001YOW|4.0|\\"Signify\\" is my first experience with older Porcupine Tree.  Compared to the newest \\"Deadwing\\", it feels much less dense, much less complex and much more lonely and solitary.  It's almost hard to believe that  it was really a 'band' effort and not just Steven Wilson.  Drums have a tendency to do the same thing through entire songs, basslines are simple alternations of a couple notes.  Guitars are either very emotional soloing or simple chord progressions.  Trademark ethereal melodies and sounds are still intact.  This sort of minimalism creates of feeling of space and like much (if not all) of Steven's work, sadness and melancholie.  At its best, \\"Signify\\" is like a misty, foggy day in the fall.<br /><br />\\"Bornlivedie\\" (10/10) is a fitting introduction, with a sweeping synth sound and a 'telephone voice' repeating each word in the title separately followed by \\"Signify\\".<br /><br />\\"Signify\\" (8/10) is an instrumental with a very simple and frankly unimagininative riff (2 notes alternating) that's none-the-less developed quite well.  Moody atmospherics are placed over the rhythms and a great solo finishes it out.<br /><br />\\"Sleep Of No Dreaming\\" (9/10) introduces us to Wilson's voice and lyrics, which on this album were very literal, honest and occasionally ironic.  With lines like \\"married the first girl who wasn't a man\\" there's a lot to infer- the irony of it sets the tone of bitterly laughing at past mistakes and lack of experience, etc.  This album seems to be the product of an honestly lonely soul, much more so than \\"Deadwing\\".  The music of this song is really 2 simple riffs, one for verses and one for the chorus.  Both are fantastic, but like most of the songs on the album there's no DIRECTION... it doesn't progress to anywhere or anything as it goes on.  For \\"Signify\\" though it's possible this style was a stylistic choice and a good one.<br /><br />\\"Pagan\\" (10/10) is a fantastic short ambient interlude.  Wilson is great at ambient music.<br /><br />\\"Waiting Phase One\\" (10/10) is probably the best song on the album.  A very memorable and sad chord progression with perfectly chosen pointillist keyboard notes overlayed, fantastic vocal melodies.  \\"Waiting - the saddest kind of pain\\".<br /><br />\\"Waiting Phase Two\\" (8/10) is a pleasant but not really standout instrumental.  Hand drums and a rhythmic but simple bass line with all sorts of little piano riffs and distant guitar playing over it.  Seems more like a collage than a focused effort.  It sets a tone but may bore some.<br /><br />\\"Sever\\" (9/10) is a strange rock song that suffers from too much repetition.  The mysterious verse and sad, desperate chorus nicely contrast each other as far as tone, but again they're the only things really present.  The drums do not change at all and after a while kind of detract from the effect of the rest.  It feels looped rather than organic.  Samples of a man hysterically laughing and yelling (\\"The only way to survive is on your knees!\\") fit in, in an odd sort of way.<br /><br />\\"Idiot Prayer\\" (10/10) is one of the best instrumentals.  Simple beat and bassline again, but very focused and structured.  Keyboards and guitars that mirror the bassline rise to a loud climax and communicate the feeling of something epic.  Eventually it drifts into some dreamy and beautiful chords on the guitar.  Most of these instrumentals are long-form, lasting about 5 to 7 minutes.<br /><br />\\"Every Home Is Wired\\" (10/10) begins with some acoustic guitar and an instantly memorable tune.  Wilson's lyrics are more external to himself this time around, talking about the invasion of technology into our everyday lives.  \\"Surfing on the network, part of me is dead\\".  A beautiful chorus with overdubbed vocals works very well.  There's some jamming after the song has seemingly ended.  The song in general is pretty spaced out and psychedelic.<br /><br />\\"Intermediate Jesus\\" (10/10) is an ominous instrumental with a lot of creative and interesting fretless bass work that steals the show.  It follows the formula of 'drum beat, bass and atmospherics' once again.  These instrumentals usually get their names from the samples in them.<br /><br />\\"Light Mass Prayers\\" (10/10) is the most minimalist song here, also one of the most effective.  For 4 minutes it's simply 2 synth chords on a setting that sounds like a voice alternated with pauses and space in between.  Somehow it manages to be amazingly sad, beautiful and strange.<br /><br />\\"Dark Matter\\" (10/10) is an excellent, developed and well-written rock song.  It begins much in the manner of \\"Sleep of No Dreaming\\" or \\"Every Home Is Wired\\" and progresses to sound more and more grandiose, heavy and epic.  Great, more complex guitar work.  9 minutes of melodic bliss.  One of Porcupine Tree's best ever songs.<br /><br />In summary, with \\"Signify\\", you'll get the same sort of sense of melody infused into the other PT albums, but a different style of songwriting than he uses today.  This is a mostly instrumental release, leaning in an ambient direction.  I wouldn't recommend starting here with this band, but it's great for fans.rics' once again.

This book was just ok. I found Penelope endearing. I love how she loved Colin and when she spent more time with him she realized he had faults instead of the image she had in her head. And Colin is a sweet sweet hero. He took Penelope at first glance instead of finding the woman inside and when he finally saw that he truly blossomed as a hero in my eyes.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is a dvd well worth waiting for. All racing fans will enjoy the ragged roar of the engines to the side love stories. DVD picture is crisp and the color is beautiful. Only word of caution: there have been some DVDs sent out missing their inserts. Currently, Amazon will accept returns but that doesn't solve the original problem nor get the DVD set into your hands. If you find you're missing the insert, I think our only recourse is to contact Warner Bros and ask them to send it. This happened when Dune was re-released this year, but Universal promptly took care of the problem by sending out the inserts. Hopefully, Warner Bros will do the same. I am going to try my luck in doing this. Will update this review to let you know if I was successful! Update August 14: I sent an email to WB re: the insert problem. The WB customer contact person advised me that the insert featured the Jim Russell Racing School. Jim Russell was the technical expert for the film. Although this insert is available on a limited time & supply, WB was very gracious in sending me an insert. It has some nice b/w pictures taken behind the scenes. Thank you WB!
B000BTC5LW|2.0|And for a concert, sound is paramount - even more important than good filming. Which, I will say, is superbly done.<br /><br />But the sound - it's awful! It gives no sense of being in a giant stadium, but instead gives a sense of having been taken straight out of the board. It's limp, which Pink Floyd should never sound like; it's boring; and there's no sense that they're actually playing live in a huge arena, but are instead just lip-synching and air-guitaring to a studio recording.<br /><br />This is by far the worst-sounding concert DVD I've ever heard. No sense of being live; and absolutely no sense of the bigness of Floyd's sound.<br /><br />How Gilmour let this happen I'll never understand.<br /><br />I will, sadly, more than likely never watch this again.<br /><br />And to let you know: I saw this concert on tour, and it was one of the greatest, if not the greatest, concert I've ever seen. So, I have nothing against the music or the visuals or the band. I am a total Pink Floyd nut. I am only nailing this DVD because of the limpid, heinous sound.
B00005RYKU|3.0|This is a lesson that Ruby and Rhett (Leelee Sobieski & Trevor Morgan) learn soon after the death of their parents and they are sent to live with neighbors Terrence and Erin Glass (Stellan Skarsgård & Diane Lane).  Things aren't as they seem in the Glass's glass home, which is pretty cool.  The point of the film being that trust is transparent and so a glass house is used to represent that beings that everything is easily seen and heard, much like the underlying plot twists which are easily seen and heard before we, the veiwer, should know them.  That's the problem here is the predictability, but then again, even with predictability it still packs a punch.  This isn't the best thriller to come out by far, but Skarsgård makes for a believable and quite scary villian.  So Ruby and Rhett realize, Ruby first, that the Glass's are using them for their inheritance which comes up to about $4 million dollars and this spirals into a game of cat and mouse that is a bit intense, thanks to Skarsgård's verosity.  All in all I give it 3 1/2 stars because it really tries to be something better, it just falls short of the mark, but not so short it's unworthy of a watch through.
B000002UR7|3.0|I'll concede that OK Computer and The Bends were their peak performances, but this is still a good album from their \\"we-still-play-musical-instruments\\" stage of their career. After OK Computer they somehow morfed into this pseudo-intellectual computer generized cluster, that somehow became trendy for critics on both sides of teh pond to slurp. Pablo Honey isn't gonna win any awards, but at least it showed signs of traditional songwriting and musical talent, and not a bad soundtrack to a Nintendo game or a bad rip-off of Moby. Lets face it, nobody actually likes that stuff by Radiohead, but it feels pretty cool to say that you do, doesn't it?
B00005JOML|2.0|If you enjoyed the movies \\"The Fast & The Furious\\", \\"XXX\\", \\"The Punisher\\" or any other testosterone-laden, shoot-out summer flicks, get in line for \\"Miami Vice\\" RIGHT NOW!! Those looking for sex and ultra-violence will not be disappointed!  Visually, this movie is stunning; cool camera angles, some washed out/colored frames, rolling the camera out of focus etc.  It reminded me fondly of the cool camera work that became one of the hallmarks of the standout t.v. show.  The soundtrack is also quite well done.  Many of the songs had a trance/house/chill feel, like those songs that are perfect when you are driving in the city at night.  Set the perfect tone for many of the scenes in this edgy film. <br /> <br />Unfortunately there are problems with the film too.  First it is simply too long at a little over 2 hours.  It seems like it was dragged out for no good reason and people around me in the theater got restless as the movie droned on.  There is precious little chemistry between Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, they come off as pissed at each other most of the time.  If this is a buddy cop picture they missed the mark BIG TIME. My friend and I actually laughed out loud at the dialogue at one point, and it was a relatively serious scene in a hospital.  Not a good sign! <br /> <br />Finally, I don't think the concept has aged very well.  In the 80's television show, Crockett & Tubbs were hard core, sometimes renegade cops.  But they were cops and acted as such.  The new rendition of these two have skill sets with planes and boats you'd be hard pressed to find in a rank and file or even a detective grade law-officer.  They are living in a fantasy world where no one has heard of Miranda rights or due process.  Undercover is one thing.  Outlaw is another.   <br /> <br />This is an ok movie, but far from a good one.  I'd recommend waiting for the DVD and renting one of the \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies instead, unless you are a die-hard fan of this genre.  In referencing Crockett & Tubbs in this movie, one of the characters remarks that something isn't quite right about them.  The same can be said for the movie, something isn't quite right about this one!
B00006AW2M|5.0|A completely superb album. Probably not for die-hard Beatles fans, as they will say \\"this is just a rip off of the beatles style\\"....because as we all know, The Beatles invented everything..... <br /> <br />I still find it weird that people can even compare songs like the whimsical and predictable \\"When I'm 64\\" to the genius, bizarre freakouts of \\"Gomper\\" or \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" <br /> <br />Listen with an open mind, in my eyes this is a much better and more genuine psychedelic album than Sgt. Pepper, and most psychedelic albums of the time, with the possible exceptions of Pink Floyd's Piper At The Gates Of Dawn, or The Pretty Things' S.F. Sorrow amongst a few more
B0000CEB4V|5.0|We have the kind of family where we promised that all ex's and all family children, blood related or not, would be family.  People think I'm strange because my friendship with my husband's ex and her family is so important to me.  She was visiting us and our granddaughter in Ontario, CAN, she lives in L.A. and she wakens to classical music every morning.  I decided to put on Concert for George, which always brings me to tears, but she never took her eyes off of the screen.  She especially enjoyed Ravi Shankar and his daughter's opening to the concert and educated us on what the music meant.  As I told my husband...no person I have shared this DVD with has ever left it with a 'so what' opinion.  They all loved it and I think, most of my friends have it by now, Beatle lovers or not.  Thanks to all who made this a tribute to George, but also a way to educate people about his talents, his many, many friends, his loving wife and son, all of whom, obviously adored George and his music, as do I....and my close friend Mary!

B00005JP7M|2.0|Woody Allen, in my opinion, is the most influential comedy director since Charlie Chaplin. In complete contradiction to the American public I've enjoyed Allen's recent films. I've openly welcomed such titles as \\"Small Time Crooks\\", \\"Hollywood Ending\\", and \\"Melinda and Melinda\\". And I was terribly please at the reaction \\"Match Point\\" was getting from the critics and the public alike.<br /><br /> But, to my dismay, Allen's lastest film, \\"Scoop\\" isn't very good. As I've said, I'm not one of these people who criticize Woody Allen's every picture, but, there are problems with this film.<br /><br /> The story revolves around a young American journalist, Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) visiting London, for an assignment on her college paper. While in London she attends a magic show where she is pulled from the audience to assist the magician (Allen of course!) in a disappearing act. While inside the disappearing box Sondra has an encounter with a spirit. A recently deceased journalist, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) has found a way to make contact with the living and has given Sondra the \\"scoop of the century\\".<br /><br /> Recently a serial killer nicknamed \\"the tarot card killer\\" has been strangling brunette prostitutes (apparently blondes do have more fun!). Now with this information Sondra decides to get Sid Waterman, the magician, to help her capture the killer. Her main suspect is Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman). Peter comes from a British version of the Kennedy family, with deep roots in politics.<br /><br /> The story admittedly sounds funny. And it recalls Allen's own \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\\". But the screenplay isn't as sharp. It's clear what Allen is aiming for. A kind of old-fashion whodunnit comedy\mystery a la \\"The Thin Man\\". But Allen and Johansson do not have much chemistry between them. Nor do Jackman and Johansson.<br /><br /> Chemistry though is not this film's main problem. The character played by Allen isn't very well delevopled, which is a surprise because Allen usually gives himself the best part. His character keeps switching on whether or not he believes Lyman is the killer or not. In one scene he's telling Sondra she's crazy for thinking it could be Lyman and in the next he's telling her she's crazy for NOT thinking it.<br /><br /> Another problem with the Allen character is Allen himself. He's trying way too hard to be funny. It's as if he's forcing us to laugh at him. Allen's performance is too \\"in your face\\". He's basically playing the same character he played in \\"Broadway Danny Rose\\", though without that character's charm. Danny Rose was a lovable loser. Sid Waterman is just a loser.<br /><br /> And finally \\"Scoop\\" committs the biggest offense a comedy can committ. I would have been able to cope with Allen's loud performance or the lack of chemistry, but, \\"Scoop\\"'s biggest problem is the lack of laughs. Many of the jokes fell flat for me. This is unheard of coming from me! I'm probably the last true Woody Allen fan on the planet. Or at least the last one in this country. But the movie doesn't have any memorable lines. Nothing my friends and I can quote to one another. There were lines in Allen's previous comedies that we could do that with.<br /><br /> Though it's not all bad news for \\"Scoop\\". Once again, in complete contradiction to the American public, I've actually missed not seeing Allen on screen. The last time was three years ago in \\"Anything Else\\". As with that film, Allen has once again made himself the co-star. I like seeing Allen on-screen. That was a welcome treat, now if only the performance would have been more worthwhile.<br /><br /> Plus, the musical score is pleasant. Allen seems to think that just because he's shooting his films in London he can no longer use his familiar jazz songs. That's not true. Does he think that American music is too vulgar for his new setting? The music in this film, as was the case with \\"Match Point\\" is classical. Tchaikovsky, Strauss and selections from Grieg's \\"Peer Gynt\\" are heard on the soundtrack.<br /><br /> The funny thing about the musical choices is, if American music is too vulgar, look at the way Allen displays the two American characters in the film. They are loud and uncultured. What's Allen saying there?<br /><br /> \\"Scoop\\" does hint at some serious topics underneath its \\"light\\" appearance, as do most of Allen's \\"trivial comedies\\". Here is a movie that tells us danger lurks everywhere. And just because things or people seem to be perfect, scandal is always close behind.<br /><br /> The movie's best scene in my opinion is the last one. It is pure Woody Allen in the best sense of the phrase. Now if only the rest of the movie could have been as funny. ** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Allen is back with a pure comedy though the results are not as satisfying as I would have hoped. Weak character development, lack of chemistry, and flat jokes stop this from being an enjoyable Woody Allen film.sical choices is, if American music is too vulgar, look at the way Allen displays the two American characters in the film.

B00005Y6YB|5.0|Lonesome Dove has been a favorite of mine since the first time I saw it. I purchased it so that my children could watch it and they loved it too!!! This movie is a \\"classic western\\" and will never become \\"outdated\\".
B00005JOMN|5.0|Michael Mann does what he does best with Miami Vice, and thats directing a superior crime film.     Forget the show, however, besides the names and namesake city, several story elements from several episodes are used.    Instead of throwing a thousand clichés of \\"buddy cops\\" saying one liners and flying from action scene to action scene with guns that never run out of bullets, Mann has given us a cop drama that is certainly \\"anti-Bad Boys.\\" Vice is far more realistic, mostly because things don't always work out right for all the characters.    James \\"Sonney\\" Crockett and Rico Tubbs have a relationship that I liked because they have a respect for each other that reminded me of Niel MacCauley's crew in Mann's 1995 masterpiece, Heat. We don't need any back story, because it would stick out and drag this particular story.     This may turn off some of Mann's fans, because character development is something hes great at.    Vice drops into the middle of a sting operation that quickly gets left for a desperate phone call from an informant who they haven't seen in months. From there, Vice begins a \\"blink and you'll miss it\\" type story of infiltration. Its a film that needs attention. Your either into it for the drama, the procedures, and wheelings and dealings, or you could be completely bored.    Mann is an acquired taste, and his films never force feed you information. I never found the movie confusing, because I was right there with the characters and followed along in with the breezy pacing. Some reviews have said the story is \\"convoulted.\\" The realism is that things don't always go down like they're supposed to, and things change quickly.    Mann stays with a scene long enough to show us the point and knows when to move forward. The romance between Crocket and Isabella was right on the money. Not too pretentious or story stopping, but enough to add some conflict. Their quick getaway to Cuba was actually pretty short, and didn't slow the movie, as I thought it would.The acting and dialogue were great. Colin Farrel actually impressed me and Jamie Foxx has already been impressing me (with Collateral and Ray.) Gong Li was also great. Even though English is her second language and some words seemed lost in the translation, she was easy to understand. John Ortiz and Luis Tosar were also great as the bad guys. They aren't the cliché bad guys who flip out at everything. They are relatively calm and act like regular people who are just doing business. They rest of the cops known from the show (Trudy, Gina, Switeck, and Zito) are simply just there as back up to Cockett and Tubbs. Naomi Harris was good as Trudy playing Tubbs girlfriend. Switeck and Zito don't have much to do. Gina, on the other hand, will win you over when she gets a gun in her hand. Shes awesome with her one scene that she steals.    The cinematography was also amazing. The HD does have a grainy effect, but, I think HD looks much better on my HDtv than it does at a cinema. However the night shots did bring the cloudy sky and city lights alive, although I did like Collateral's orange/blue look better. I guess Mann didn't want to have it look \\"exactley\\" like Collateral. The locations Mann found are amazing, even the plane flying through the clouds and the boat racing across the sea are unlike anything I've ever seen.     Bottom line: Not as great as Mann's Collateral and Heat, but, if you liked Collateral, Heat, Thief, and Manhunter, or even The French Connection and To Live And Die In LA, you will like Miami Vice. If your looking for Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon, you've come to the wrong place.
B000BMSTMS|2.0|After 'Issues', I had all but given up on Korn.  It was a combination of me just not being as much into rock anymore along with the new directions the band was taking.  Now, I can respect bands trying new stuff out, and they don't have to stick with their \\"signature\\" sound.  But this album just does NOT do it for me.  I went and listened to Untouchables for the first time AFTER hearing this and it just rocks compared to this one.  I'll probably get slagged for not being a \\"true\\" Korn fan.  If you were a teenager when the first 2 albums came out, I'm willing to bet you share my sentiments.  In my opinion, every artist/band has to be held accountable for every single album.  I just think that MOST of the people that were hardcore into Korn back in the day (I'm talking about BEFORE freak on a leash, BEFORE got the life, and BEFORE adidas. There weren't too many of us....) cannot take this album seriously.  I was so excited when Follow the Leader came out and convinced myself it was a great CD.  Over time I've realized it's mediocre and forgettable at best. The first 2 albums still hold their weight as some of the best music of the mid-late 90s, but everything changed after that. <br /> <br />I'm tempted to change the station every time I hear the chorus to 'Coming Undone'.  Sadly, it's one of the better songs on this CD.  I realize that no 14 year old kid cares whether or not The Matrix wrote several songs on here (you know they write for Avril Lavigne and Hillary Duff, right?!), but to me it's a clear indication that the band has their creative backs up against the wall.   <br /> <br />And having said all that, I'll gladly be at the Family Values show in Nashville tomorrow to see the swan song of a once great band.
0688170528|2.0|I feel that once you've read a couple of Jodi's books, the rest are very easy to figure out.  Having read her newer books, I thought I'd go back to some of her earlier work....not much has changed.  In the book the Pact, I found it very unconvincing that Emily was so tormented that she wanted to kill herself.  I kept waiting for the big reason to be revealed, and it wasn't.  I'm sure the incident with the \\"Creep\\" in the bathroom was devastating to a young girl but didn't feel like that was enough reason to send her into a downward spiral of wanting to commit suicide.  Her relationship with Chris was just totally creepy.  They did grow up as brother and sister so I can understand how Emily felt about that.  Easy solution - tell the guy you feel like he's too much of a brother to you and get over it!  When Chris went to jail I had major de ja vu.  Having just read Vanishing Acts I felt a little annoyed that we had to go through all the horrors of jail.....again.  With the Pact being written first, I felt like Jodi got lazy and just recycled the jail scenes into Vanishing Acts....two books with pretty much the same set of circumstances.  It was annoying.  This book was very unbelievable.  If we were to believe that Emily was suicidal I think more work should have gone into convincing us.  I also feel that if Chris really did love Emily the way he said he did, he would not have taken a loaded gun around a suicidal person.  He could have found a way to get help for her.  I don't think a real jury would have found him innocent...no way.

B000002C1W|4.0|...that not only do most of the anti-Gilmore folks exhibit some serious spelling issues, they also claim that The Final Cut was one of Pink Floyd's best. Now, I love Waters-era Floyd with a passion, but even I have to admit The Final Cut was pretty trashy in comparison to masterpieces like Meddle, Animals, WYWH, DSOTM and The Wall.  <br /> <br />A Momentary Lapse of Reason is the best of Floyd's post-Waters releases. Learning to Fly, Sorrow, and On the Turning Away are all great songs, One Slip is catchy, and A New Machine is excitingly strange (not really a \\"song,\\" but still good). The only track I didn't enjoy was The Dogs of War, which for some reason struck me as being a little cheesy. Waters-type subject matter, but without Waters to do the lyric writing. All told, AMLOR isn't Dark Side of the Moon, but it's worth a listen, and it's certainly better than most of the stuff being recorded nowadays.
0767020308|3.0|With Kate Beckinsale in the lead, this should have been a whale of a movie, especially if Ms. Beckinsale was allowed to bring some of her persona from Cold Comfort Farm in which she played a more Emma-like character there than she was allowed to do here. Beckinsale's Emma was overly moody and had none of the light cheerfulness of Austen's Emma (or Ms. Paltrow's for that matter). Mark Stong is not Jeremey Northrup but he is VERY good. Unfortunately, this movie never establishes that Mr. Knightly is a daily presence in the Woodhouse household (i.e., compare with the Northrup-Paltrow version), which is critical to understanding the relationship between Mr. Knightly and Emma. Indeed, their love for each other is nearly a shocker in this version coming in its last 10 minutes. If you are an Emma fan, you may find this film a disappointment. In general, I prefer Ms. Beckinsale over Ms. Paltrow but Ms. Paltrow's film is a better Reader's Digest adaptation of this lengthly and rich novel. I wonder if modern movie/DVD audiences have the patience for a longer 4 and 6 hour versions of this novel akin to what has been done for Pride & Prejudice by the BBC and A&E, respectively. Indeed, the latest 2-hour version of P&P by Hollywood is a bare skeleton of that incredible story.
B000G73UEU|2.0|This seems like the comic-book version of a classic.  There is a handful of honest covers of Leonard Cohen's songs out there, but none of them is on this CD.  If it's really necessary for you to hear an \\"interpretation\\" of the original reality, try Jeff Buckley's \\"Hallelujah,\\" Jennifer Warnes' \\"Joan of Arc,\\" or (yes!) Joe Cocker's \\"Bird on a Wire.\\"  With one or two exceptions--like the McGarrigles--the singers here are bland, tuneless hacks hitching a ride on songs they don't even understand.
0060555661|5.0|This book is light reading compared to Ben Graham's seminal tome, Security Analysis.  It's easier to read, and shorter.  It's also more up to date.   Highly recommended for investors of any stripe, value or growth.  The appendix, from Warren Buffett's speech at Columbia University is particularly entertaining, as he debunks academia's love affair with efficient market theory. Jason Zweig, an obvious Graham disciple, does a fantastic job bringing the book's principles to life through modern examples.  The only grating thing is his constant derision of brokers or anyone that actually gets paid to manage money. (full disclosure: I'm an analyst now and was a broker for 10 years).   <br /> <br />Ben Graham clearly invested in the stock market during a period of hustlers, crooks, crashes, and frauds.  Brokers, investment bankers and analysts back then were not much more than fast-talking salesmen.  Wait a minute, that sounds just like the way things are today on Wall Street!  Things may not have changed as much as we would like to think.  Due to his travails as an investor in difficult markets, Ben Graham's investment style evolved into a systematic, logical approach which became the basis for value investing. In \\"The Intelligent Investor\\", Graham lays out the foundation of value investing by three introducing key principles:  the idea of \\"Mr. Market\\", a value-oriented disciplined approach to investing, and the \\"margin of safety\\" concept. <br /> <br /> \\"Mr. Market.\\" <br />The stock market on a daily basis resembles a casino, only without the comfort of free cocktails.  Watching the stock ticker is like having a business partner that is totally schizophrenic; Graham calls him \\"Mr. Market.\\"  One day he loves the business and wants to pay a ridiculous price to buy out your half.  The next day, all hope is lost, and he wants to sell you his portion for pennies on the dollar.  Graham argues that this daily liquidity is an advantage that most investors turn against themselves:(p. 203) \\"But note this important fact:  The true investor scarcely ever is forced to sell his shares, and at all other times he is free to disregard the current price quotation.  He need pay attention to it and act upon it only to the extent that it suits his book, and no more.  Thus the investor who permits himself to be stampeded or unduly worried by unjustified market declines in his holdings is perversely transforming his basic advantage into a basic disadvantage.  That man would be better off if his stocks had no market quotation at all; for he would then be spared the mental anguish caused him by other persons' mistakes of judgment.\\"  This is profound.  It's not a question of whether our stocks will drop; they will: the trick is how we respond to that eventuality.   <br /> <br />Ben Graham's Stock selection for the defensive investor. <br />Graham lays out some important characteristics of \\"value\\" stocks. (p. 348).  Some of the metrics are dated, but the principles are still valid.  Even deep value investing today would seem like GARP investing to Ben Graham.  Investors are now more focused on future earnings than they were in his day, and valuations reflect that. Graham recommends: <br />a. Adequate size of the enterprise (>$100M revenue, old figure) <br />b. Sufficiently strong financial condition (2:1 current ratio) <br />c. Earnings stability (some earnings every year last 10 years) <br />d. Dividend record (uninterrupted payments for at least 20 years) <br />e. Earnings growth (1/3 increase in per share EPS past 10 years) <br />f. Moderate price/earnings ratio (P/E &lt; 15x average last 3 years EPS) <br />g. Moderate ratio of price to assets (price/book &lt; 1 1/2 times) <br />h. Overall stock portfolio, when acquired, should have an overall earnings /price ratio- the reverse of the P/E ratio - at least as high as the current high-grade bond rate.  A P/E no higher than 13.3 against an AA bond yield of 7.5% <br /> <br />Margin of Safety as the central concept of value investing.   <br />This is an investment rule that was written by a man who had been deeply bruised by bear markets.  I believe he came up with this by learning from his losses.  When the market turns into a storm of feces, like it inevitably will, if the stock has no earnings to rely on, you have nothing to grab onto.  You can't make yourself stay in the stock when the price is down.  Graham says: (p. 515) \\"The margin of safety is the difference between the percentage rate of the earnings on the stock at the price you pay for it and the rate of interest on bonds, and that is to absorb unsatisfactory developments\\".  Furthermore he writes: (p. 518) \\"The buyer of bargain issues places particular emphasis on the ability of the investment to withstand adverse developments. \\"  You can and will still lose money in the market with value-oriented investing, but according to Graham: (p. 518) \\"The margin guarantees only that he has a better chance of profit than for loss-not that loss is impossible.\\"   <br /> <br />Conclusion <br />So that's it, those are the three basic points of the book, but you should still buy it and read it, it's a very enjoyable experience, Shakespeare for the investing crowd. Despite being a realist, Ben Graham wasn't a total pessimist.  Late in the book Graham makes a point that is one of my favorites: (p. 524) \\"A fourth business rule is more positive:  \\"Have the courage of your knowledge and experience.  If you have formed a conclusion from the facts and if you know your judgment is sound, act on it- even though others may hesitate or differ.  You are neither right nor wrong because the crowd disagrees with you.  You are right because your data and reasoning are right.  Similarly, in the world of securities, courage becomes the supreme virtue after adequate knowledge and a tested judgment are at hand. \\" <br />

Lord of War is a good movie and I can recommend you to see it.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer has written or edited several outstanding works on Islam and the challenge it poses to a free West. This book, part of the Politically Incorrect Guide to... series is a more informal, easier-to-read version of his earlier works. Thus there is not too much new material here if you have read his earlier volumes.<br /><br />But having a more popular level volume on this subject is important, if for no other reason that people are busy and pressed for time. So a volume like this with its important contents can be scanned through in several hours.<br /><br />Spencer covers a number of important issues. One major topic is that of the Crusades. Of course whenever people express concern about Islamic terrorism, and ask whether Islam is really a religion of peace, the usual tactic is to raise the issue of the Crusades. The implication is that the Christian West is no better than Islam, and perhaps worse, because of the Crusades.<br /><br />And the Crusades are often dragged up by Muslim apologists almost as an excuse for present day jihad and terrorist attacks. It is as if the Crusades justify modern terrorist movements. Thus Spencer devotes a good third of this book to examining the issue of the Crusades in some detail.<br /><br />Spencer discusses the reasons why the Crusades began, and clears up a number of myths surrounding them. In short, he argues, it is more accurate to view the Crusades as a defensive war, a reaction to 400 years of Islamic expansion and imperialism. The attempt to reclaim the Holy Lands and rescue Christians was a big factor in the Crusades.<br /><br />While much excess of violence took place, and the Crusades were far from perfect, they do need to be seen in context. A number of points are raised by Spencer. For example, he cites Muslim authorities who in fact claim that Muslims tended to fare better in lands taken by the Crusaders than in Muslim lands!<br /><br />And as for the 1099 sack of Jerusalem, yes it was barbaric in many ways. Yet it was not out of line with standard military practices of the day, be they Western or Muslim. Indeed, Muslim commentators of the day took a rather laconic interest in the whole matter. It was only later that this episode in particular, and the Crusades in general, became ammunition in the Muslim propaganda wars.<br /><br />And what about equally odious Muslim offensives, such as the sack of Constantinople in 1453? While we constantly hear Westerners today apologising for what we did or did not do long ago, one hardly ever hears Muslims apologising for this event, or the massacre of the Armenians from 1915 to 1917, or dozens of other major Muslim atrocities. Where is the hand-wringing over these acts? Why are only Western shortcomings highlighted?<br /><br />Spencer also examines the practices of Islam over the centuries: its oppression of women, it denial of freedom of conscience; its totalitarian nature, and its justification of jihad. Consider this last issue, for example. Many will argue that jihad is not really to be understood literally, that Islam is a religion of peace, and that only extremist Muslims practice violence. Not so, argues Spencer: \\"violent jihad warfare against unbelievers is not a heretical doctrine held by a tiny minority of extremists, but a constant element of mainstream Islamic theology\\".<br /><br />Thus all four major Sunni schools of jurisprudence agree on the importance of jihad. Indeed, Islam is unique among the world's religions \\"in having a developed doctrine, theology, and legal system that mandates warfare against unbelievers\\". Spencer cites chapter and verse (or sura) from the Koran, along with sayings from the hadith (traditions) and examples from the life of Muhammad and his followers which make clear that the use of force is a mainstay in Islam, not an aberration.<br /><br />Many other myths about Islam are here convincingly dealt with. Spencer concludes by reminding us that we are in a war. It is a war \\"between two vastly different ideas of how to govern states and order societies\\". In this struggle \\"the West has nothing to apologize for and a great deal to defend\\".<br /><br />The differences between Islamic sharia law and totalitarian rule and Western freedoms and democracy are very real indeed. The two cannot co-exist. One will prevail, and Spencer knows which one he would have persevere.<br /><br />He finishes with four simple proposals: Western foreign aid must be tied to the treatment of non-Muslims in Muslim nations; global alliances need to be reconfigured on this same basis; Muslim nations must renounce sharia expansionism; and the West must embark upon a full-scall search for alternate energy sources, so that we no longer have to rely on Middle Eastern oil.<br /><br />All in all this brief volume contains a lot of helpful information. Many myths and misunderstandings about the nature of Islam and its threats are carefully dealt with here. While such information does not mean that we treat individual Muslims disrespectfully, it does remind us that there are two different ways of life competing for supremacy, and we need to be aware of this struggle and fortified with the right information. This volume helps us in that task.ar \\"between two vastly different ideas of how to govern states and order societies\\".

B000B8QEZG|5.0|I'm thoroughly confused why American radio is still refusing the play the singles off of this absolutely stellar album. This is Madonna's best work in years -- # 1 in 40 countries, all of the singles #1 on the dance charts, the videos #1 on TRL and the best selling concert of the year -- yet no radio airplay??? Not sure what's going on. Madonna personifies the American dream. She is the Queen and is only getting better with age! I'm STILL not tired of listening to this CD and it's been out for almost 9 months! Maybe people have been listeing to so much weak dance music over the past few years that they don't recognize the real deal when they hear it. XOXO M!
B000E8QVWY|4.0|The acting in this movie was absolutely brilliant! Joaquin Phoenix is probably doing the best role he has ever done. The music itself in this movie makes it worth seeing. I loved this movie and I am sure that you will aswell. Enjoy! <br /> <br />[...]
9707704667|5.0|This is Mario Vargas Llosa's dirty old man's fantasy about having sexual encounters with a superwoman-sex machine with multiple partners who meets him between them.  Not new in his form of writing, this ficticious autobiography takes back the kind of tale he left behind in La Tia Julia y el escribidor (Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter) with its humorous, almost grotesque situations well set at the political turmoil of late sixties Paris and the Mod's years of London.      A great proof that the so called \\"Boom Writers\\" still alive are like elderly statemen of Spanish storytelling who leave the writing of some of the new ones (sorry, nothing personal) looking pale.     I, who was beginning the first years of my literary training, during the effeverscence of the \\"Boom\\", have right now this feeling of gladness seeing him (Mr. Vargas Llosa) starting to cure at last of some big political wounds he had shown publicly in recent years; and maybe this book had served him in a  literal way for doing that:  the \\"niña mala\\" is like in Tomás Eloy's \\"El vuelo de la reina\\" (The killer bee) a metaphor.    It is significant, that in the last pages, which take place in Madrid (where Don Mario lives now) he says to her in their last encounter:  \\"I am at last cured of you...\\".  I hope it will be for a long time, and for good that he comebacks to literature of adventures,good humor, romance and Flaubert.  We, his faithful, old readers are happy for him.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Scarface is about Tony Montana (Al Pacino) who manages to escape from Cuba to United States in the 70's. In the States Tony starts to work in a cheap restaurant....but Tony has much bigger plans. His ambition is to be filthy rich with plenty of women and nice cars and houses. He is determined to reach this goal no matter what it takes. Tony gets a foot into the gangster world afer a cocain deal that Tony handeled good. Slowly he starts to climb the ladder within the gangster world in Miami in order to reach his goal. The movie is very violent and there is nudity, cocain, guns, killings etc. In my opinion this is a really good movies and Scarface is one of the best gangster movies ever made. Enjoy!    [..]

B000F0UUIM|5.0|Im not a big fan of westerns in general but this is a great film.This recent remastering is one of the best I have ever seen. The colors on this technicolor print have to be seen to be believed. The film literally glows and with the stunning landscapes makes this DVD a must have. This is one of the two or three greatest Westerns ever made and in my opinion the best film ever done by John Ford. John Wayne standing in the doorway of the cabin with his low slung hip is one of the iconic images of film history. A must have!
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Britney Spears conjures up many different reactions from many different people.  Since she first heated up the airways (and television sets) in 1998 with her super-smash debut single \\"...Baby One More Time,\\" a dynamite pop music classic, the hot-and-heavy award-winning Spears has been at the center of everything entertainment.  Her last to date studio album In the Zone is eclectic, different and veers far from her bubblegum roots.  Though it's hardly as likable (and definitely not as innocent) as her debut album ...Baby One More Time or as listenable as Oops!...I Did It Again, In the Zone focuses itself around Spears' biggest asset: her looks, and everything she does to get attention with them.  There is no doubt Britney was the hottest woman on earth before she met her current husband, and this is apparent on Zone.  \\"Toxic\\" is, of course, the standout track here and the most famous, and it won the pop sensation her first Grammy; it's an amazing track, sinful, delightful and just so groovy it can't be disliked!  The remainder of the record follows almost to suit, but there are some potholes like nearly every other Britney Spears CD.  The two ballads, never Spears' greatest musical form, are actually good.  The introspective \\"Everytime\\" is about her similarly-famous first man, but it happens that the other slow song is more commercial and actually sung instead of delicately whispered.  Again, it's not perfect, but it shows that Britney Spears could be a real talent and not just a flashy hot-looking piece of industry meat.
0385040253|5.0|This is a marvelous piece of work, a wonderfully compiled index and history on the amusing subject of knots.  Moreover; this is the story of knots, written with a scholar's pen (so, it's educational), but told with a seaman's heart. The author's passion for his subject, evident on every page, animates all of his hand-drawn, disciplined  illustrations  (Ashley was a student of the great Howard Pyle), which lends the book a nice, user-friendly appeal. As the author literally unravels the chords of the past on the subject, he then meticulously ties all loose ends together to knot the vast gamut of one of  humanity's oldest skills and indispensable crafts in one timeless reference book. Here is a legendary work for the ages on a specialized professional skill, and a skill people rely upon everyday.    If you've never known an appreciation for knots or simply never considered that you should, then, if this book doesn't convert you into a knot lover, it will certainly energize your interest in knots, reminding you that the knot is not an ancient relic specific to seamen and now extinct; but is extant, and still essential to life in today's high-tech world, alive and well in your home, office, post-office, etc.  You'll see simple knots that you've known since you were in diapers (remember those), and sophisticated knots, most of which you've never known to exist; but their stories and simple beauty will captivate you. You may even learn about knots that emerged around the time you were born. And you can practice tying many of the knots, using the illustrations/diagrams as a sure guide. The knot lives!    And if you already love knots and understand their historical value to civilization, and you don't already own this book: Shame on you! Get it now. If you love history, then you cannot afford not to own this book, for the knot is actually the node which links all of history together; mankind, as we know it, would not have survived were it not for the knot.  Now there was aknot of a sentence, but that's just the way the book is.    Of course seamen love this book. But children will enjoy the knotlore as well.     This book is fun, fun, fun!
078062999X|3.0|I know that as a character Hamlet is not supposed to be all warm and fuzzy but it is well if there is something about the actor playing him that makes one content to spend a little over four hours in his company.  I'm afraid that Kenneth Branagh doesn't have it.  If he did, he's lost it and I hope he gets it back before we are subjected to another huge chunk of Branagh chewed blank verse. <br /> <br />This Hamlet was like being in the wintry presence of the most humorless of vice-principals for an entire ice age.  The only warmth were the real sparks generated by Derek Jacobi and Julie Christie as Claudius and Gertrude.  Oh, how I wish they had been left alone by their querrulous bad tempered overaged boy.
0679759328|4.0|I saw a film version of Hotel du Lac on TV one night and was absolutely hooked.  I found the book and read it right away. <br /> <br />I love the fact that the narrator can't be trusted. Actually she does not trust her own judgement either so we can't laugh at her behind her back.  <br /> <br />Not much plot: a not so young woman who writes romance novels is banished to the Hotel du Lac for one month for the horrendous crime of not showing up to her own wedding. <br /> <br />At the hotel, she meets a cast of characters who keep her and us guessing. <br /> <br />What I think is really funny is that despite her mild mannered exterior, the main character is as selfish and cruel in her own way as any one else at the hotel. We overlook it or misinterpret it because she is so colorless.
0679411585|5.0|This book tells the true account of the battle of Ia Drang. NO book could have captured the intense battles a well as this has. After reading some war books about vietnam and World War II, I have only one thing to say, This is possibly the greatest recration in words of the actual battles I have ever read! Read this book and understand the true horrors of battle. With the release of 'We Were Soldiers' there is no doubt that this book will become more popular than it already is. God Bless America.
0385512104|5.0|I have a friend whose son is autistic.  I read this book and felt I lived inside her son's head while I read it.  Everything that I had learned about her son and his mental landscape matched with what was written in the book.   <br /> <br />In addition, the story itself and its characterization of the boy was so moving and real!  You can't help but like the characters.   <br /> <br />
0312305060|5.0|I recently read this book, and I couldn't put it down. I loved it. I got really engrossed in the characters, and I felt sorry for the mother and the son. I felt like I knew them. It is definitely a great read and I loved the movie as well. I would recommend it to anyone. A GREAT READ and A MUST READ.
B000EXZHAG|5.0|The \\"Dark Third\\" represents one of the finest progressive releases of the year.  Pure Reason Revolution is a band that's going places and I strongly suggest you board their train now!! <br />With a sound that likens to Porcupine Tree and Pineapple Thief, the \\"Dark Third\\" is loaded with well-crafted songs full of vocal harmonies, musical soundscapes, and excellent production.  This isn't metal, prog, or whatever genre you wish to pick, but a composite of styles, thus \\"progressive\\" in the truest sense.  Buy, listen, and enjoy this debut release!!  An excellent recording from a very promising band!!!!! You will not be disappointed.
0312263120|1.0|I read the Da Vinci Code and really enjoyed it, so I decided I'd try another Dan Brown book. This one sounded like it could be interesting, but the only reason I managed to finish it was because I was traveling and had nothing else to read during down time. As mentioned in other reviews, the plot and characters left a lot to be desired. It was borderline absurd at places.  <br /> <br />But, what really killed me were the misrepresentation of a lot of technical details. Things like stating that the \\"standard 64-bit pass-key\\" required 64 characters and could not be memorized easily. Or the idea that there are people at the NSA watching monitors displaying circles representing \\"security firewalls\\" and sharks representing attacking hackers swimming through them, which strikes me as absolutely ridiculous. <br /> <br />Admittedly, I am a computer engineer and probably care more about such details than most, but I can usually except a certain amount of \\"stretching the facts\\". This book, however, stretched too far.
1567404103|5.0|The Harry Bosch series is not only a mystery, but a thriller, and at times quite humorous. Mr. Connelly really knows how to pull the listener into the story. <br /> <br /> In addition, Burt Reynolds, reads so well you'd think there was more than one reader. I'd have to admit, even though the story could stand on it's own with being suspenseful, Mr. Reynolds added such a depth to the written characters, it was difficult for me to stop listening. <br /> <br /> Sure hope, Mr. Connelly keeps Harry Bosch alive, AND Mr. Reynolds keeps reading to us.
0671027387|3.0|'Deception Point', though not lacking for action and plot twists, lacks the depth and intrigue of 'DaVinci Code' or 'Angels and Demons'. This book reminds me of James Rollins' work, or a lighter Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child. Worth picking up in paperback if you like action-adventure-mystery.
0061020710|5.0|Terry Pratchett's imaginative style and great plot twists keep the reader both amused and almost unwilling to put down the book. Even if you're not into fantasy, the humorous nature of the novels will draw you in, with the moments and items that poke fun at \\"roundworld\\" life in a uniquely Discworld way. <br /> Although this wasn't the first book I read in the Discworld series, I find that just about every book that I've read by this author is accessible on its own and does not need a primer in Discworld knowledge in order to be both understandable and funny. <br /> <br />This is definitely an addictive series of books.
0887307280|4.0|The book is pretty good at decribing the process one must go through in order to run a small business. It is typical that someone goes into business becasue he/she loves the thing that they are doing, say cooking. But that does not always translate into a successful business. This book does a good job of pointing that out. Those interested in small business should do as much reading and researching as possible. This book should be part of that.
1400049628|5.0|This is truly the best book I have ever read on the subject. It is well written to really get the information absorbed by the reader. It is very informative while being light enough so as not to scare the reader into immediate panic. A great guide like this will surely spawn more volumes of text on the subject but I don't think any will be as good as this.
B00005JOML|4.0|After reading the negative press about this flick, I definitely had to see it, because I didn't believe that a Michael Mann movie would be a miss. From the get go this film is cool and stylish, and it has all the ambience of Miami with the fast cars, Ferrari, Bentley GT, BMW 8 Series, fast boats, private jets, water, and attitude. I was surprised to see that the film stood its own and probably only used the \\"Miami Vice\\" title for marketing purposes. Sure, the TV Miami Vice characters are there by name, but this movie could have lived without the comparisons, and in fact I was trying hard to find reminders of Miami Vice the TV show, but I really couldn't find any and I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  At first viewing I was hoping that the music would be better, but after I bought the soundtrack and listened to it several times as well as watching the DVD several times, the music is actually an exceptional selection. Also at first viewing I thought that the acting wasn't that good overall and that the script had some problems, but after watching the film now several times there are many gems in this film, also in the acting with standouts by John Ortiz who does an excellent job as Jose Yero, and then as brief as his role was, but Luis Tosar as the drug kingpin named Montoya produces a very convincing character with great acting.  I really enjoyed this film and I have now watched it several times on DVD. Everything is done so well with the location choices and the many details, and the photography was excellent, and overall it was a very good story about the drug trade and in a sense it reminded me remotely of Pacino's Scarface two decades ago - of course Miami Vice is a different flick and as it's growing on me with repeated viewing it's becoming one of my all-time favorite films.  I'm not a Colin Farrell fan, but he did a very good job in this film. Also Li Gong added to the substance of the movie and plays a unique character as Isabella who appears cool and distant on the surface, but portraying much passion and sensitivity on the inside - great acting.  Does this movie deserve an \\"R\\" rating? Maybe, because of some sensual scenes and the occasional and unnecessary use of the F word, but compared to other flicks with a PG-13 rating I would say in today's age a PG-13 would have been more appropriate.  One thing that I rarely do, I've watched this movie now several times on the big screen and the DVD is a definite buy and belongs in every DVD collection -- get the Unrated Director's cut -- it's excellent and it's a cool flick. Director Michael Mann pays attention to all the details, ... the sky, the mood and ambience, the cars, boats and airplanes, etc., the style, the soundtrack which is also a must as you get selected songs by Moby, India Arie and Manzanita, etc.  I think most movie fans will begin to appreciate this film in years to come as a unique cinematic experience. This movie deserves almost 5 stars, ... really it's that good considering all the details, but you will have to watch it a few times to appreciate the many details and to discover the hidden gems.

B00000JPYD|5.0|Growing up I listened to Bridge of Sighs countless times and for good reason. It's a tremendous album with no filler. Robin Trower, a stellar guitar player, was obviously influenced by Hendrix and you hear it in his tone, solos and the heavenly blues/rock music. His band, at that time, Reg Isidore (drums), James Dewar (bass, vocals) held down a tight rhythm section, and James vocals (smooth, thick, beefy) are uniquely wonderful. Killer music has no expiration date, and this sounds as amazing today as it did when it was initially released in 1974.  <br /> <br />The remastered version sounds good but not necessarily better than the original disc, just different. To me, it seems most remastered discs just boost the high frequencies and increase the volume, which is not always a good thing. The five live bonus tracks recorded in 1974 give you an idea of what this trio, that once played in stadiums, were capable of. Amazon lists these incorrectly; tracks 9 and 12 should be switched. It would have been nice for this \\"expanded edition\\" to include the lyrics and some photos but, overall, this is a classic rock disc and if you're a guitar player this is a must have.  <br />

B0007KIFGO|4.0|Russell Crowe is, without a doubt, very good in \\"Gladiator\\", but Tom Hanks in \\"Cast Away\\" is superb. It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.<br /><br />This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film, the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.<br /><br />Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight. What then happens on that flight is no secret. Suffice to say that it is a wonderfully filmed disaster scene that is sure to strike terror in even the most blase of travelers.<br /><br />The second part of the movie is the crux of the film. For nearly an hour, Hanks is the only living human being on film. He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance. We watch as he survives the rigors of his days and copes with the solitude that comes with being marooned on a deserted island for four years, sustained by a photograph of his fiancee, Kelly. Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.<br /><br />The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading. Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances. He is rescued, but after four years the life he left behind has all but disappeared. Kelly has moved on with her life, and he, in effect, has been cast away. It is here that the picture falters somewhat, as there is no happy ending and the film ends somewhat unresolved. Still, it is an excellent film, and Hanks' performance is definitely award calibre.t washes ashore.

B000092T6M|4.0|I have always loved this movie, and was really excited to see there was an extended edition.  This edition really is extended though. There is an extra 10-15 minutes of scenes that were previously cut from the movie.  Most of the scenes that were added have to do with the Sheriff of Nottingham and the witch sub-plot going more into depth about their relationship.  It was interesting to see the stuff the got cut from the movie, but it did get cut out for a reason.  This DVD has the deleted scenes integrated into the film as you watch it.  There is no feature that allows you to watch the originally edited version.  In my opinion the new scenes totally break the flow of the movie.  The editor knew what he was doing originally.      Besides the issue with the intgrated deleted scenes, I have one other issue: the grapics for the menus are cheesy and poorly done.  But that is just a little innoying.    This DVD does have some other great features though.  Lots of great little tidbits like interviews, commentaries, histories, a live version of Bryan Adams' \\"Everything I Do\\", and even a soundtrack feature to listen to just the music.    Overall this edition is a world of improvement over the old one. The extended edition has some great stuff on it, but i'm just a little disappointed with how some of it is presented.
B00005JLWN|3.0|This is an enjoyable, if not very original, movie about a society in the near future that has decided it can avoid war by suppressing human emotions. Everyone is required to inject themselves with a Prozac-like drug that greatly reduces feelings. Art is outlawed, and Christian Bale plays a leader of a team whose job is to go around finding art and destroying it and those harboring it. I found that aspect of the story to be a (perhaps unintentional) metaphor for the current failed War on Drugs.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a totalitarian future that's not influenced by George Orwell, and this film is no exception.<br /><br />There are several well-done fight scenes which are heavily influenced by The Matrix, with excessive gunplay, impossible martial arts moves, and even a leather-clad main character.
B00005ATQF|3.0|once again i find myself at odds with most people(even close friends) over another kubrick movie. unlike \\"the shining\\" which i found boring(read my review),full metal jacket is half of a great movie,by which i mean that the first half  at paris island and the training of marine recruts is in  your face movie making at its best. lee ermey(a real life drill instructer) gives the acting job of a lifetime as the brutel d.i. in charge of whiping boys into marines. he is scary and in your face and you have to watch him. he really moves the movie onto another level and brings the words \\"break them\\" to a whole new level! just as good is vincent d'onofrio as a sad sack who just can't get it right. funny at first you see how his gental nature begins to warp as he is beat down mind and body by ermey and the other recruts as they start to get punnished for his failers. nothing is more heart breaking(or mind breaking) as his beating with soap wraped in towels by the other recruts. after this d'onofrio goes off the deep end and the end of the training part of the movie goes out with a bang! <br />       this is where the movie really should end because we now go to nam and this movie never recovers the ground it had at first. it becomes a grade z war movie and you can tell what's going to happen well before it does. this part of the movie is so bad that it looks like a different movie and director. and the fact that it was shot in england also shows and drags the film down the drain. <br />       matthew modine is the \\"star\\" here and he does a very nice job,but as said the first half is so good that the second half just really lets you down.    5 stars for the first half,-2 stars for the sad second half = 3 stars
B00005CDNK|5.0|This album is like their 'Dark Side Of The Moon'. There is nothing to prepare you for what you are about to hear. Sure, there were hints of this on Super Trouper ('Winner Takes It All', 'Happy New Year'), but the melodrama of these compositions has been dropped for something far more darkly mature. These songs are autobiograghical and you suddenly realise that with the exception of TWTIA, they had not expressed themselves in this way before ('Knowing Me, Knowing You' was completely fictional). The opening song, 'The Visitors' is so powerful, from the menacing intro, the suppressed vocals from Frida to the slabs of dominating synths at the end of the chorus. It is a truly scary song conjuring pictures of fear of the Soviet Union in '81. It took a while for me to realise that this is the only ABBA song ever written which does not rhyme. At all. And those lyrics are simply amazing (\\"These walls have witnessed all the anguish of humiliation and seen the hope of freedom glow in shining faces..\\"). Astounding. 'When All Is Said And Done', as has been described, is a song about Frida and Benny's divorce but it also demonstrates a still vulnerable Frida lifting her head and moving on.......yet despite the forcefulness of the delivery, you can sense it masquerades real doubt. One of the most fascinating songs is also one of the most overlooked: 'Head Over Heels'. This did not fare too well as a single. What is apparent is that this is supposed to be a bouncy, happy Abba song, but it fails in its remit. Instead what you hear is meloncholy all the way through it. Like somebody who is still grieving trying to laugh. 'Like An Angel Passing Through My Room' is sublime. A ticking clock and Frida lamenting her lost loves. This is inspired. The original recording ended with that ticking clock.......would they be back? Of the additional tracks, 'The Day Before You Came' and 'Should I Laugh Or Cry' are the best. TDBYC is probably their finest recording and what makes it even more beautiful is the fact that it has been largely overlooked and therefore does not suffer from overkill. Agnetha is actually role-playing in this song: she is the bored, lonely woman.....and deliberately sings like one (hence the reason why her voice quivers so much in it). Frida's aria inbetween the verses is both haunting and heart-breaking. 'Should I Laugh Or Cry' has an amazing vocal performance by Frida with an interesting lyric where she is exasperated by everything that her partner does or says (a far cry from 'Honey, Honey'!). This is not to overlook 'Cassandra', yet another beautiful song. There is a subtle warning, i guess, of what is contained inside by the beautifully contemplative album cover. Each of them pre-occupied with their own thoughts. The first time the four of them are not together and not looking at you. A perfect swansong.iful is the fact that it has been largely overlooked and therefore does not suffer from overkill.

0440238153|5.0|In this third part of the narrative I looked again for comparisons with JKR's Harry Potter (HP) series with questions in mind such as: which is better literature, why is HP so much more popular, and last to give my critical analysis of the plot and the moral narrative. Certainly all three of these issues are entangled with one another. Part of the analysis would have to be related to Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" and I will be reading several essays on that as well as refreshing my memory on that poem - since the last I remember reading it was in undergraduate school in the 70's. This is certainly an interesting challenge since both books are interesting. Grounds for saying that the HP series is more popular might seem pretty clear but this book at this writing lists as #12,907 while, by comparison HP 3 lists as #13,185. Yet overall sales makes HP far more popular [...]<br /><br />Despite the addition of several more characters I still think character development is better in HP then PP and I would argue the main advantage to the HP series is in the way the characters interact as friends that develop detailed, interactive, maturation narratives while dealing with the course of action. The HP plot takes place over much more time - seven years. PP's idea of using daemons as intriguing insights into character type is an interesting one but also seems a bit strained. Why would an individual become fixed once they reached puberty? (I am still a kid at heart - my daemon would certainly be constantly changing! Humph!) Why would a bear not have one? Is this speciesism?<br /><br />PP eats the church alive! I can see how this might be a take off from Milton's Satan who perhaps may be seen as a much richer character than God. How ironic --\\"the authority\\" -\\"the ancient of days\\" -- to have the creator puff away by accident. This plot juxtaposes the trite science versus religion narrative with all virtues on the side of science -- emotion, love, and intellect - while the church gets discipline, stupidity, mean spirited-ness, and evil. It sounds like the image Opus Dei gets in Dan Brown's DaVinci Code. Stephen Jay Gould would at least suggest that there are non overlapping magisteria (NOMAs) and religion and science are partners. The so called war between science and religion is really a war between smart people (including religious ones) and stupid people (including those fundamentalists who think their uneducated interpretation - the \\"literal\\" interpretation - IS the religion). But this ridiculous narrative is a central part of the main plot. This leads PP to present a narrative that in some respects makes use of the newest in quantum physics but uses metaphorical Biblical creatures, and others, as if they were real. We end up with witches flying on fir branches and angels holding a man's head underwater. Agreed, witches fly in HP as well but there is a difference. JKR does not couch the plot in contemporary physics making the suggestion that alternate universes can interact and scientifically impossible things in any possible universe exist in them. But if this is meant to be thought provoking and entertaining, well fine. So is Alan Lightman's \\"Einstein's Dreams\\". Besides, I am persuaded that Leibniz was right about this being the best of all possible worlds (read \\"universes\\" today).<br /><br />Last, who are the kids that are the audience for the PP series? If HP created such conflict and even book burnings because of the narrative, why were there no like outcries over the PP books? (Were there?) Perhaps there wasn't because they did not get as much press? While saving the world through love is a wonderful motif, the relationship between two adolescents falling in love seems a different sort of love - Eros instead of Agape. In short, the series does not seem to be the sort of thing conservative Christian parents would want their children reading but might not protest since they don't know the books are there. I keep asking people if they haveheard of them and finding no one saying yes.<br /><br />They are good books. They are interesting. I am glad I read them. But HP wins.ding no one saying yes.    They are good books. They are interesting. I am glad I read them. But HP wins.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love this series.  It never should have been taken off the air.  The DVD's are excellent.  The bonus features are very informative for Firefly fans.  The never-aired episodes are just all the more reason why the show shouldn't have been cancelled.

B000002KXV|5.0|I first purchased a tape of \\"The Nightfly\\" in the 80's and am so thrilled to have the CD now. If you love the music of Steely Dan, you will enjoy Donald Fagen and Nightfly. <br />The lyrics take you back to the late 50's and early 60's with such phrases as \\"she's got a touch of Tuesday Weld, she's wearing ambush and a french twist\\", but the music is contemporary, light, jazzy and so soothing to listen to. I love the \\"feel\\" of The Goodbye Look and Walk Between the Raindrops\\". <br />The arrangement of Ruby Baby and Maxine are especially good. <br />What can I Say? The music is timeless and I'm sure I will listen to this CD for the next twenty years!
0142004413|5.0|This was a book I hated to see end.  The descriptions of Corfu, family members and residents of the island, and wildlife were lyrical and loving.

B00005JOML|4.0|They could have goofed on the 80's cop show like Bacardi's TV spoofs and all of the \\"updated\\" big screen translations, most recently: Bewitched, Starsky and Hutch, the DUKES of HAZZARD.<br /><br />But Director Michael Mann still has a vision for Miami Vice and it's South Floridian cops. He wanted to make the film what the show was at the time, edgy and pretty, because Mann know composition. The imagery in the original was so interesting to look at that it generated a pop-culture icon that seriously (and embarrassingly) influenced fashion. Although now the pastels and linens are gone, the high-def photography,intense edits and high action kick VICE up to Mann's usual high standards. Like Collateral he delivers in a modern setting in colors as dark and gray as Crokett and Tubbs very souls.  Colin Farrell's Crockett is okay, minus some corny lines, and Foxx's role as sidekick, makes him seem underused.<br /><br />The story is tricky, but merely the means to the music video ends, which is a Mann film: The pair infiltrate a cartel to scope-out a dept. leak. There's lots of drugs, some women and incidental music (no Jan Hammer though).Mann struggled with whether or not to use \\"In the Air Tonight\\" for one pivotal pre-battle scene (you'll have to go for yourself to see if he did.<br /><br />It's about what you'd expect , no more, no less...<br /><br />By the by, the shoot was so intense Farrell checked into rehab immediately after.
0451191153|3.0|Ok this is a great book. Also a hilarious one. Ayn Rand manages to dump more personal baggage into this \\"novel of ideas\\" than a trailer dweller on Jerry Springer.     Basic theme:   Howard Roark is better than everyone. Damn it. ( subtext: Ayn Rand is better than everyone. Damn it.) The world just can't handle excellence and will resort to any low, underhanded, dirty tricks to take out its brightest lights like Howard (aka Ayn Rand, or at least the type of man she'd associate with). Why? Because the snivelling, disgusting mass that makes up humanity is jealous, that's right jealous, you're all jealous and Ayn Rand hates you!    Luckily men of excellence all recognize and understand each other. No matter if one is an architect, and another is a newspaperman, they all have some mystical great-man bond allowing them to immediately identify one another and engage in tense melodramatic, backslapping exchanges. At least that's how it works out for Howard Roark, and his crew. They also get to pass around the same hot chick. Her superiority over the masses is never quite explained. She can't build offices, or publish papers, but she's super hot and boy does she know her excellent men.     I love this book. Its completely unhuman, and coldly brilliant protagonists make for a quick, entertaining read. The writing is good, and you have to hand it to Rand for getting her point across.     Did you know she is the first person to ever suggest that resentment of excellence is an important, but negative component of human experience. Honestly. She came up with that. No philosopher had ever written at legnth about that. It's all hers. She's brilliant. Like Roark. Actually, that's not true at all. But she obviously believed it.* Which makes for a highly entertaining read.      *note: I'm not trying to diss Ms. Rand's 'lect. She was definitely way smarter than me.

The only way that she can get more books is to steal them, which she does.  She shares all of her literary treasures with everyone, including Max, a Jewish man who is hiding in her basement.  This story shows us the power of the written word to provide hope,and the amazing capacity of human beings to build friendships that can flourish in a world gone mad.

The bonus DVD with surround mix of the album and extras is icing on the cake!<br /><br />The older the album, the more it can benefit from remastering and this album is no execption-it sounds sooo much better! I tried a listening test between this remaster and the original CD and was totally blown away by the remaster!
B00004Z4SD|5.0|The Straight Story is film paradise; repeated viewings will only make you like it more.  It is an extraordinary work of art that is as surprising as it is richly rewarding.  If ever there was a case of \\"less is more,\\" this is it.<br /><br />The story, (both bizarre and fact-based), is almost Shaker-esque in its simplicity.  Alvin Straight, a 73-year-old man in failing health from Laurens, Iowa, rides a garden tractor 320 miles to Mt. Zion, Wisconsin in hopes of making peace with his dying, estranged brother Lyle.  On the way, the incredibly slow way, he meets nice people and we learn a great deal about him.  (Imagine pitching that to a producer!)<br /><br />Retired stuntman Richard Farnsworth plays Alvin to perfection.  The hard years are visible; his craggy face resembles a well-worn baseball glove, although there's sparkle, even mischief, in his eyes.  When Alvin smiles it's the smile of a man who has seen all the hardship life has to offer and still chooses to embrace it.  Straight is laconic but unlike most characters, every word matters and reverberates with authenticity.<br /><br />The pacing in this picture is faultless, through vignettes played out in chance encounters we come to understand Straight and the complex trials he's endured, as well as his need to make amends with brother Lyle.  These small scenes are played out on a vast, sumptuous visual canvas of American farmland, gigantic John Deere harvesters cut broad swathes as Alvin put-puts in the foreground.<br /><br />The reliable Angelo Badalamenti provides a lovely, non-intrusive score while Sissy Spacek shines as Alvin's daughter.  But the truly stunning thing about The Straight Story is that it was directed by David Lynch, demonstrating once and for all that Lynch is capable of creating movie magic without resorting to dwarfs talking backwards and dogs dining on severed ears.  This is a profoundly humanistic and gentle film that moves with slow confidence - no cheap tricks.  For me, knowing that Lynch made The Straight Story actually improves all his other films after the fact.ally improves all his other films after the fact.
B00005JM20|4.0|\\"A secret monk order in inner Mongolia has developed a system of chants....\\"<br /><br />Who says Austin Powers is the only name in spy spoofs?  Johnny English may not be as flashy, silly or ok maybe even funny as Austin Powers, however he may indeed have more charm, likeability and certainly more believability.<br /><br />Nearly everything in this cute satire could indeed happen and perhaps that is the funniest - or scariest thing about it.  Austin Powers and Inspector Closeau may be bumblers or more interested in \\"shagging\\" than in getting the bad guys and saving the world - but Johnny English is focused.  He's always wanted to be a top spy and when he gets his chance he makes the most of it - while making a hilarious mess of it!<br /><br />Granted the plot and even script are weak, but Rowan Atkinson rises above both and it's his inherent comic genius at timing that really saves the day.  Overall the laughs don't come full throttle, but their are several scenes which had me busting at the seams - and rewinding the DVD again and again.<br /><br />Give Johnny English a try - you'll be glad you did.  And to the producers:  Give Rowan Atkinson another go as Mr. English - with a little more work on the sequel script, you may indeed have the franchise you'd hoped for all along!
B000002UAU|5.0|Let me get this straight: four geniuses from the UK diligently spend exorbitant amounts of time on producing a masterpiece...then they rent a studio and proceed to follow through with one of the most ridiculously astonishing albums in music history. For the uninitiated, welcome to the conceptually brilliant world of the late 1960's.  <br /> <br />The Beatles always exemplified everything we wish we accomplished in our lifetime. They were a bunch of rich beautiful people who woke-up one day and suddenly thought that their deep thoughts were going to change the world. Well, the verdict is in, and this mind-blowing confession of teen-aged evolution changed everything. In fact, it signifies nothing more than the beginning of the era of the biggest copycat albums of psychic energy in modern pop culture history. The 1960's have unfortunately ended. Let's add this marvelous use of time to the mountain of important cultural memorabilia that needs to be remembered forever. Where's John and George when you really need them? Thank you for your time. -AK.

0140067477|2.0|I picked up this book because it seemed so charming. The author took the stories and characters of A.A. Milne and juxtaposed them with the Taoist teachings of people such as Lao Tzu.  <br /> <br />Pooh as western Taoist starts off interestingly enough but halfway through it I came to the realization that it was making me want to just read the actual Milne, who was frankly probably a genius writer. Those were great books with great characters, each with their own type of intelligence. <br />  <br />Then about two thirds through the book, it just becomes insulting. The author is against pretty much anything useful. Rather than believing in the give and take of Ying and Yang (or any other name it may go under) he's against intellectuals who are secretly foolish for trying to figure anything about the world, against people who work hard and care about their jobs or contributions (again that's just foolish), people who enjoy sports or exercise...heck he's against leaving your house or caring about the rest of the world. I understand the idea behind the Busy Backson rant, but is there no middle ground at all?  <br />The idea of the Indian American culture being superior to that of the almighty Puritans is used as an example, which could be built upon in several interesting ways, but instead the author chooses to illustrate how everything that came after was just silliness without supplying a single idea about how it could be done better...yet useful. <br /> <br />At one point he actually uses the example of (paraphrasing here) turning on the T.V. news to hear \\"`Thirty thousand people were killed today when five jumbo airliners collided over downtown Lose Angeles\\" *click* Stop worrying about everything and go about life. Listen to the birds chirp, they will tell you more about the world.\\" ---wait, we shouldn't care about thirty thousand humans being killed in a horrific accident?  <br /> <br />I am in no way an expert on Taoism, but unless everyone who IS finds that idea posing as a representation of their philosophy to be offensive, I want nothing to do with it. It isn't enlightened to go around hating everything while doing nothing. And I'm sure the author realizes this since he spends so much time writing best=selling books. <br />
B000F5GNX8|5.0|I just saw this today on Pay per view. I saw the trailer for it back when it was playing in theaters, and really wanted to see it. Never happened, but I'm glad I finally saw it today. I found myself just loving the film in the first twenty minutes. When I wasn't trying to figure out the mystery, I was laughing hysterically. Val and Robert are hilarious together. Their chemistry is the driving force of the movie. Michelle Monaghan is a huge talent in my opinion. Never seen her in anything before this but I hope I'll see more of her. All three actors had amazing chemistry and that is what made this movie totally awesome. That, and Harry having his finger eaten. That helped too.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|The dialogue was fascinating and engaging, and this movie captures the essence of being a teenager in the 80s. The movie could have been improved by not glorifying drug use and by explaining just what the heck happened to the principal, who disappeared halfway thru the film!
7119005901|4.0|The story is just beautifuly written. I love Chinese history and mythology and all that stuff and this was just... beautiful. I am really enjoying the work of these books and to all of you that like Chinese history and/or mythology, then please taky some time to read at least one volume of this series. The only thing is, the names may start to get confusing so if you don't have a very good memory, then it will get very confusing about who's who. Other than that, this was perfect.
0143057375|5.0|I recommend the CD set as I find it much easier to absorb than the book (but then again, I am not very good at reading written material).<br /><br />One comment expressed by many reviewers  and that would like to echo is that Ekhart paints a powerful spiritual picture that may well help you understand enlightenment, and the obstacles and traps along the way, but it will not get you there. this book can set us on the path, but the rest is up to us and will NOT occur quickly or easily.
B000002KHH|5.0|I bought this cd just one month ago but i had a copy for more than 6 years. Since i'm not a fan of heavy metal, i even don't like much Black Sabbath work after Masters fo the universe (it's just a matter of personal taste, they have all my respect), Paranoid contains music that still makes me shiver and dive in holy joy. Psychadelic, it's the kind of record that takes our mind in straight forward levitation, in search of new horizons, like Hawkwind music for example. The difference, it's that Hawkwind are like a speed train and Black Sabbath on Paranoid is more like a small plane, up and down, up and down. Absolutely audio fun.
B000007MVM|5.0|I've put off reviewing this album for a long, long time. This album changed the way i view music forever about 8 years ago. I had read about Syd Barrett in a guitar magazine when i was about 19 and they described him as the floyds original brilliant singer/guitarist/songwriter, i thought WHAT?, there was a guy before Waters?, Gilmore?. Being a casual PF fan at the time I was intrigued to find out about this Syd guy wrote all of the bands early singles ( \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" great songs ), the first album, then basically nothing, until i found out that he done 2 solo albums. Living in the smallish town i did, there was no real alternative style record stores and the internet was still just begining to become a house hold thing, but one of the record stores we did have was able to order in the Syd Barrett solo albums, so i took a gamble as often people do with music and ordered in the box set, featuring TMCL, Barrett, and Opel. THEN upon recieving this the first cd i listened to was The Madcap Laughs, at first, i was extremely dissapointed, yeah, listening to this guy sing out of tune, bad production, out of time, i thought this is just a mess. NEXT cd Barrett, same, Opel, worse, then left it for a couple of days, maybe it was weeks, not sure, then came back and thought it can't be as bad as i first thought, and i was right. In goes TMCL and though there was no lyric booklet i began listening to these strange but intensely captivating and original lyrical twist and turns, every song had them, pick any song. \\"Oh where are you now pussy willow that smiled on this leaf\\" Dark Globe, and then sing with perfect clarity, \\"inside me i feel , alone and unreal, and the way you kiss will always be a very special thing to me\\" on late night, there are so many different lyrical approaches, one must have repeated listens to fully appreciate. The moods too, are all here, the funny story which is \\"Here I Go\\" and sad and desperate \\"Long Gone\\". Not to forget even though Syd would go out of time and tune sometimes, he would keep perfect tune and key for songs at a time, \\"Love You \\", Terrapin\\", \\"Octopus\\", but then when recorded on a bad day, he couldn't nail a thing, \\"If it's in you\\" is a funny and sad in the same song example. This is about as honest as music can get in both a good and bad way, but always honest, Syd was no fake, even if this was unintentional, yeah sure people can say his instabilty musically and personally was due to drugs or whatever because on Pink floyds debut PATGOD, the bad timing, out of tune vocals, were non existant cause his drug problem hadnt affected him noticebly and thats a valid point, and to think if he was in better shape mentally at the time, and the production and playing had more time these could of been even better, but Syds solo albums were what they were because of the faults, because the talent is obviously there, but the faults stand out just as much. Though Syd was falling apart at the time he still had the drive, talent, and passion for his music, in which he had only one more album left in him after as this, (\\"Barrett\\" a different but equally brilliant album). Once being captivated by Syd Barretts \\"The Madcap Laughs\\" album, you will be changed forever on what music can be, and is. Whether that remains a postive and experience of growth as mine was or worthless experience is up to you and who you are, But this album is timeless, whether you like it or not. Syd Barrett achieved what he did before he was 25, which was, come in say what he had to say, make your mark, and be done with it, now he's recently past away, his story is finalised, R.I.P Roger \\"Syd\\" Barrett, you and your music will not be forgotten.yd would go out of time and tune sometimes, he would keep perfect tune and key for songs at a time, \\"Love You \\", Terrapin\\", \\"Octopus\\", but then when recorded on a bad day, he couldn't nail a thing, \\"If it's in you\\" is a funny and sad in the same song example.

0743201140|1.0|To do anything with this you need to go online and take the profile.  Only one per book.  So if someone else in your family wants to, they have to buy a new book with a new access code.  They are blatantly just trying to make money off this.<br /><br />As far as content, pretty weak.  I wish I had read through the reviews here before I spent money for this book.  Don't bother buying a used copy, if the previous person used the code, your out of luck.
B00005JOML|3.0|First if you haven't seen the movie yet, you might want to skim my review.  Also to anyone that gives this 5 stars or 1 star I kinda question if they have seen the film yet. <br /> <br />Ok I am a die-hard fan of the series and I am probably going to be a more critical & nit-picky (which I am not that type of person) because I was expecting more of a Miami Vice movie and not a watered down Collateral or Heat.   <br /> <br />Before I begin I was excited that this was going to take place in 2006 and not 1986, (more tech & less pastel) and maybe I got my hopes up too much.  Also I find this hard to be a true remake because it was so flawed.  (and I am not sure if it was purposely written that way) <br /> <br /> <br />Movie itself - It starts off great 20 good minutes of action (especially when the feds got knocked off - very good camera work!) then a complete drop-off of 60-80 minutes of boring fluff that could have been removed. (with the exception of the \\"grenade\\" talk scene) <br /> <br />If it wasn't for the final 40 minutes I would have been EXTREMELY upset, because the action tries to tie the movie together and while it really doesn't, its just an awesome ride of action and eye-candy.  I actually started to wake up.   <br /> <br /> <br />The Story: <br /> <br />The story seemed to be a rip-off from the last episode.  Both being made FBI agents trying to make a big bust in South America, having the feds trying to call the shots, and them doing their own thing.  The only thing that was missing was them throwing down their badges and retiring, which was replaced with an  abrupt ending. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The Characters: <br /> <br />Sonny: - Colin did a good job playing him, but the writing for his character was bad. (Don Johnson would have thrown the script back, and said, \\"I don't need to work this bad\\")  <br /> <br /> <br />In the opening scene Sonny flirts with a bartender and did it just like his character, but then the flirting stops and it becomes total cheese with Isabella.  Isabella was a fling and nothing more and Sonny falls head over heals for her.  Which was sorta needed for the ending action, but they overdid it.  Also where is Sonny's houseboat with Elvis? Now he has a two seater and lives in \\"safehouses\\". <br /> <br /> <br />Tubbs:  Jamie was great, actually I wish they had more scenes with him.  The only major complaint I had, was with \\"Tubbs\\" flying the plane.  Every mission in the TV series, they hired a pilot, but I guess Tubbs took flying lessons recently. <br /> <br /> <br />Tubbs & Crockett as a team:  There is no chemistry at all between the two.  It's so bad that most of the movie is with them off doing their own thing.  There was virtually no dialogue between them. When they did communicate, they seemed like they were never on the same page. They might as well said \\"We aint as tight as we were in the 80's, but I don't have the urge to kill you\\" <br /> <br /> <br />LT. Castillo:  By far the biggest letdown! The previews showed that it looks nothing like the character from the 80's, and I was prepared for that, but this former \\"No Maam\\" member from Married with Children did not act anything like LT. Castillo.  At first he lets Crockett & Tubbs do their own thing, heck Lt. Rodriguez from the TV Pilot had more pull, and when Castillo finally takes charge he seems so scared like he is going to have a heart attack soon.  I know the 80's Castillo wasn't always cool and composed, but he usually had his \\"stuff\\" together. <br /> <br /> <br />Trudy:  Computer wiz in the 80's, same today except that she has muuuuch more of a swagger & attitude now.  Her character played a vital role in this movie and was written the best of the entire cast. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall:  I was very impressed with the eye candy backdrops.  Michael Mann did all of that without computers. <br /> <br /> <br />I liked that this wasn't an 80's Miami Vice, the pastel colors should be left in the 80's.  The action scenes were awesome and left you begging for more.  Even the \\"Dirty Harry\\" scene.  But there were too many times that in the middle of the movie I had to keep telling myself that this was a \\"Miami Vice\\" movie, which kinda defeated the purpose of seeing it in the first place. <br /> <br /> <br />If you haven't seen the movie yet, I highly recommend that you go with the open mind that its nothing like the 80's version, the chemistry of Crockettt & Tubbs isn't there, and that maybe Crockett and Tubbs were purposely written with different traits and personalities, and there is a reward at the end after sitting through the painful middle. <br /> <br />3 out of 5 stars...
B000093BDX|4.0|This is a wonderful CD with a ton of great music on it. I particularly enjoyed the CD insert with background information on the Beach Boys and information about all the songs. Well worth the money!!!
B000001FGG|5.0|Sorry, but this is my favorite 'album'of all time. I wore out two vinyl copies of it and still slap on the CD when in doubt about what to listen to. This album is the sixties to me: indeed, when Saturday Night Live lampooned hippie holdovers in a skit, it had them listening to Spoonful from Wheels of Fire. <br /> <br />The Live Disk contains the best stuff you can get- Crossroads in the definitive Clapton treatment, played on a firey Strat above rumbling, volcanic bass lines and precision trip-hammer jazz-rock drumming. The epic treatment of Spoonful still conjures images of Hades, rolling thunder, burning rivers, thundering beasts (the 'elephant race' middle instrumental passage). Also, it features amazing mournful vocals by Jack Bruce, sounding like he is negotiating in blues format for his mortal soul. This rendition is just so doggone inspired. If you listen to it after listening to Cream's studio original from \\"Fresh Cream\\" or the Howlin' Wolf original, your mind reels from the comparison. They were really feeling this version. They're playing like the Hell Hounds are really on their trail. <br /> <br />For a time, in the early seventies, I grew tired of the extremely long 'Toad' workout by Ginger Baker, but in recent years, it seems one of the many stellar high points of the proceedings. It's great and it never bores me now. Sure, its drumming for the sake of drumming, but so what? Its effing awesome spectacular unparalleled. <br /> <br />The Studio Tracks <br />White Room, a big hit for Cream in 1968 is orchestral cum wah-wah mysterious with a spacious sound with vocals by turns ethereal and menacing. It rocks on, I want to say. It was backed on the 45 by Pressed Rat and Warthog (I think), one of Ginger Baker's goof-poetry ditties that always was a favorite of mine. The balance of the songs are amazing. \\"As You Said\\", a string piece featuring Jack Bruce on cello and vocal is singular -  nothing like it I'm aware of. It has always perplexed, amazed and pleasedme when I hear it. The arrangement is super-fine. Deserted Cities of the Heart is a great, underrated track that boils along feverishly. Those Were the Days is an outstanding pop song whose lyrics typify my feelings about That Time (1968)- pure nostalgia written nostalgically at the time. Politician and Sitting On Top of the World are major Cream cuts which most people know. They are essential, bluesy rock classics. <br /> <br />I feel totally at home when I hear this stuff - I always listen to this many times when on a road trip: can't imagine travel without it. <br /> <br />You know, I haven't even mentioned Train Time - blow that harmonica, son! <br /> <br />Can we make this 6 stars?
068981528X|5.0|When I told my son that I bought a book called \\"The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig\\" he just laughed at me and corrected me.  When we got it, he couldn't get enough of the book.  I think he has it memorized now! :) Very cute
0060594888|4.0|This book is a good motivator. If one has never purchased a self help (motivational) book before this is a good place to start. As many publications that Mr. Canfield had put out, this one can be the Chicken soup of books (pun intended) as it gives one everything they need to feel better and heal at the same time.

B00005LC1H|5.0|I have loved Faulty Towers for years.  I wasn't aware there were just 12 episodes.  But I am so glad to have them, Now my 17 year old daughter and 12 year old nephew love them too.  The Amazon price was awesome too.  I saw this at a very large and well known bookstore for 49.95.  Try this product if you really like comedy, you will not be disappointed.
B000BTDMDC|5.0|Clever lyrics that speak volumes couple with a mod and punkish sound to produce the best CD in the last year. It is a must listen. Alex Turner's voice has a tinge of pre-1973 Bowie-sound.
B000056K04|4.0|This is the first DMB album I ever listened to. I was skeptical of them at first because of my father's fondness of them, but I soon changed my mind. <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />\\"I Did It\\"- Best song on the album. Has a tremendous groove, and shows the band at their best. <br /> <br />\\"When the World Ends\\"- A great tune that I wish garnered more radioplay. Has a great anthemic and catchy chorus. <br /> <br />\\"The Space Between\\"- Most famous DMB song on this album. Garnered heavy radioplay, albeit a little too much radioplay, but well deserved.  <br /> <br />\\"Dreams of our Fathers\\"- Another great tune with a great lyrical message. Should be recognized more often. <br /> <br />\\"So Right\\"- Another song with a tremendous groove. Very, well, \\"groovy\\". <br /> <br />\\"If I Had It All\\"- Awesome mellow tune, the band really plays at their best here. <br /> <br />\\"Everyday\\"- Another famous song. My second favorite on the album. Very catchy, and with some great acoustic work. <br /> <br />Low points: <br />\\"Sleep to Dream Her\\"- Sorry, but a bit boring. <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\"- Just can't get into this mellow tune. <br /> <br />\\"Mother Father\\"- It's not THAT bad, but still a low point.
0060512806|4.0|This was a taxing effort, but well worth it. I found myself carving time out of my schedule and staying up late at night, searching for a good break point. There aren't any; so be prepared to lose some sleep. Lots of characters with alot of action. This book leaves itself open for a sequel. Keep writing.

B0000UJDLM|4.0|I remember our class winning a trip to see this movie when I was in elementary school and of course, we all loved it then. And now, many many years later, I still do love Short Circuit. The movie focuses on a company called NOVA that has constructed these new robots (which, surprisingly, don't look that out-of-date) but when a power surge hits while they are charging up, the robot called Number 5 comes alive and so the adventure begins. As he seeks for \\"input\\" he meets Stephanie (Ally Sheedy) a kind-hearted animal-loving woman who drives a lunch truck for a living. But when Stephanie discovers that Number 5 is alive, she does everything she can to protect him from the guys at NOVA who just want to disassemble him. Great fun for a low-key night at home, you'll love Short Circuit. Kids will too, but there are some profanities in there so parents, please use your discretion. Enjoy!
B00005JMJG|5.0|This movie is brilliantly made.  The cinematography is truly beautiful, and the story is extraordinarily original.   <br /> <br />Watch it over and over to discover details such as the color of her hair as a mechanism keeping track of time.   <br /> <br />My favorite thing about this movie is that it portrays realistically (unlike so much media) that love is not perfect happily ever after. <br /> <br />Way to go to Jim Carrey for proving that he can make quality movies with complicated parts... beyond just The Truman Show.
B00003CWNR|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was well-made and well-acted.  My only issue with it is that it lacks the depth of Irving's novel.  Obviously, recreating that would be a near-impossible feat in this medium.  They say a picture is worth a thousand words, but in this case I'll take the words.
B0007GAERG|2.0|We Belong Together is a classic Mariah song. Unfortunately- that and Shake It Off are the only good songs on the CD. I really like Mariah's voice- but she just doesn't do anything interesting with this record. I wish she would take more chances and be more creative.
0142405787|5.0|Having just read the six existing Alex Rider books in rapid succession, this one is by far my favorite.  I really enjoyed learning more about Alex's parents and his father's career. <br /> <br />Also, I was able to connect the most with the character of Alex through this particular book.  The previous books do not closely examine Alex's emotions or psyche (which I find to be appropriate because his \\"lack\\" of emotion is likely a desireable trait for a spy).  In this installment we see a growing internal conflict in our hero, making things all the more interesting. <br /> <br />This book is by far the most exciting and interesting Alex Rider book!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|It's really sad that this record isn't getting airplay. Madonna has created some of the most fun, timeless music I've heard in quite awhile. Hung Up, Sorry, Get Together, How High, Push and especially Jump are amazing. It's blows my mind that someone who's been creating music for 25 years still has such catchy, creative, and imaginative music in them. These songs deserve to be heard..and danced to!!!
B00005JOQS|5.0|The \\"Superman\\" movie franchise got off to a great start in 1978, with Richard Donner's original, starring Christopher Reeve in the title role, and co-starring Gene Hackman, Marlon Brando, and Margot Kidder. When \\"Superman II\\" rolled around, it hit rough waters. Production problems, combined with an end result that felt a little mixed, made for a good sequel, but trouble was apparently on the way. Following it up, were two films that put the nail in the coffin of the franchise for two decades, \\"Superman III\\" and \\"Superman IV: The Quest For Peace.\\" These films are best forgotten, and such is the premise of \\"Superman Returns.\\"<br /><br />Taking flight as a direct sequel to the original, with very loose ties to the second movie, \\"Superman Returns\\" is basically an attempt to make up for lost time and to finally show the world that Superman is truly an icon, not just some guy in a spandex costume, floating behind a blue-screen. Newcomer Brandon Routh replaces the late-Christopher Reeve, and does a splendid job. Routh is dead on in his portrayal as both Superman and Clark Kent (my only regret is that there wasn't much Kent to be found in this movie). The brilliant Kevin Spacey does Lex Luthor sweet, sweet justice, and not to do degrade Hackman's prior performances, but Spacey serves up the most threatening and diabolical version of the character. Behind the direction of Bryan Singer, who helped bring the \\"X-Men\\" franchise to the surface, \\"Superman Returns\\" is a success by nearly all accounts. Despite it's flaws, such as a mis-cast Lois Lane in Kate Bosworth, and a somewhat predictable plot, this film is easily the most action packed and enjoyable blockbuster of the year, and truly revitalizes Superman.<br /><br />It's sad that it took the success of another Warner property, the outstanding \\"Batman Begins,\\" last year to get this movie, (which had spent years in development Hell), up and off the ground, but alas, Superman has been reintroduced into the public eye, and in a big way. The best part about this movie is that not only is it true to the source material, and to the film(s) that precede it, but it's also a film that wasn't tailor made just to please the Superman faithful. \\"Superman Returns\\" is a film that everyone and anyone can find enjoyment in.n a big way.

B000F7CMRM|2.0|If you're the type to be shocked by the suggestion that the U.S. government would meddle in international affairs in order to protect U.S. business interests - then you'll be SHOCKED by this movie. <br /> <br />The plot was purposely jumbled, I think to create \\"intrigue\\", but instead rendered the movie confusing.  Clooney's role was relatively small and not that challenging, and thus his performance didn't strike me as noteworthy.  Any actor capable of looking frumpy and muddling through 10 or 12 scenes while looking \\"serious\\" would have done just as well. <br /> <br />The best thing about this movie was the marketing.  Give those guys a raise for generating so much buzz for this mediocre movie. <br />
B0002Z9HT8|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect. I mainly got it for a file of music from the 80's. I was really surprised with the content of the disc in the set. A lot of memories came back as I viewed. I remember watching this when it actually aired. It was fun to watch with my kids who were babies at the time. I found they were not only interested in the music at their birth, but also the situation of the days, and awareness of the times when they were unable to yet comprehend life. My oldest daughter, now 25 was very surprised to see how real the issue of AIDs was even then. They've grown up with public awareness, and to come to an understanding of where this AIDs deal started enlightened her. <br />
B00005JMCW|5.0|My two girls - ages 7 & 9 have watched it 10 times and they love it.  I've never been a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and wasn't interested in seeing it, but after seeing all or part of it several times I must admit it's funny and engaging.  Lohan and Curtis both give great performances - having to act both as a highschooler and as an adult, and the supporting performances are all solid.  And there's not much in the way of objectional material. <br />
1592401791|5.0|<br />The Internet is a powerful force that allows everyone to express their opinions publicly, and that's a very good thing. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it also allows people to spread exaggerations and lies, and that's a very bad thing. <br /> <br />As the last reviewer states, this is a fine book, and essential reading for any Beatles fan. Geoff Emerick is one of the last remaining Beatles \\"insiders\\" to publish his recollections, and he tells his story with clarity and admirable honesty. This is no \\"puff piece,\\" a la George Martin's books, nor is it a gossipy tabloid-style tell-all. The focus is always on the music, and that is as it should be. <br /> <br />Personally, I didn't find this book to be a \\"character assassination\\" on George Harrison, or on anyone else. In fact, I didn't really see any of the negatives expressed by the last reviewer, but that's unimportant; the reader will make up his or her own mind. What is important is to set the record straight, because Candace Scott's review below is filled with gross exaggerations and flat-out untruths about what Emerick does or does not say in his book. <br /> <br />First of all, to state that Geoff Emerick \\"worshipped Paul McCartney, adored him, fawned over him and lapped up any tiny amount of attention Macca paid to him\\" is a gross exaggeration which paints a picture of the author - perhaps the most celebrated, influential, and innovative recording engineer of all time - as a kind of lapdog. It is a characterization which is inaccurate, unfair, and disrespectful. Talk about \\"character assassination\\"!  <br /> <br />Secondly, the word \\"hatred\\" doesn't appear anywhere in the book, nor does Emerick ever use the term \\"agonizingly bad\\" to describe Harrison's guitar playing, nor does he even comment on George's playing more than a handful of times (certainly not the \\"30 times\\" cited, or anywhere close to that).  Nor does Emerick make much comment at all on the few times that George or John played bass instead of Paul. <br /> <br />And now we get to the nitty-gritty of Ms. Scott's review. For the record, Emerick never once calls Harrison \\"sullen,\\" \\"mean,\\" \\"caustic,\\" \\"unfunny,\\" or \\"an extremely untalented songwriter,\\" nor does he ever state that \\"neither he, George Martin, nor the rest of the Beatles could keep their eyes open whenever George rehearsed one of his songs.\\" He never once calls Ringo \\"stupid\\" or \\"dim-witted,\\" nor does he state or imply that Ringo contributed \\"virtually nothing to the group.\\" In fact, he goes out of his to say exactly the opposite, and he certainly never takes any credit for Ringo's drumming, though he does (rightfully) take some credit for the SOUND of Ringo's drumkit. (Credit that he shares with Ringo himself, expressing admiration for the way that Ringo would hit the drums hard despite being of small stature.) <br /> <br />I also disagree strongly with her contention that Emerick expresses \\"no affection\\" for John Lennon; there are many instances in this book where he reflects warmly on Lennon's kindness and consideration, not least of which appear in Emerick's recollections of his overwhelming feelings of sadness and despair on the day John was shot. It is true that he also presents with admirable candor the other side of Lennon, the nasty side that overcame the tortured musician during his frequent mood swings.  <br /> <br />As far as being \\"almost grudging in his praise of `Strawberry Fields,'\\" that is sheer nonsense. Emerick says flatly that he, and all the crew in the control room, viewed Lennon's masterpiece as \\"clearly something special,\\" a feeling that was reflected in the sheer amount of time spent on crafting, working, and reworking the song. <br /> <br />And then we come to McCartney. Ms. Scott obviously has the knives out for Sir Paul, and she is entitled to dislike him for whatever reason if she chooses to. But her characterizations of Emerick's \\"love\\" for Paul are grossly exaggerated and misstated.  Emerick never says (much less \\"insists\\") that \\"Paul knew more about conducting an orchestra than George Martin himself,\\" nor does he say that Paul was \\"the only one who cared about music.\\" And he absolutely never \\"openly states\\" or even implies in any way, shape or form that George and Ringo were \\"pawns, utterly unimportant in the scheme of things, and session musicians could easily have filled their place.\\" For Ms. Scott to say \\"It's amazing that someone who worked so closely with the group could make such a demonstrably assinine [sic], ill-informed remark\\" is mind-boggling. It's unbelievable to me that someone can offer a criticism of a statement that was never made in the first place!  <br /> <br />Lastly, Ms. Scott tells us that Emerick \\"could have\\" delved more into drug use by the Beatles. She must enjoy reading tabloids. Personally, I'm glad that Emerick didn't go there. Such stories add little to our understanding of the creative contributions and music of the Beatles. She also accuses Emerick of providing only \\"minimal\\" character portraits of the Beatles, something that is also untrue. Not only is there a significant section of the book devoted to such thumbnail portraits, but Emerick takes every opportunity to share with us his observations about how each of the four Beatles reacted and interacted as individuals as they worked in the recording studio and crafted their timeless recordings.  It is precisely those keen insights which make this book so invaluable.

B000067CPX|5.0|When I first listened to this cd I was very disappointed. I had recently become a fan with Californication and at that time I had also bought Blood Sugar Sex Magik (I have all their albums now). So I listened to the opening track, By the Way, and liked it a lot. But the rest of the songs were too poppy for me. I was very sad and I thought that the energy from their previous albums was now completely gone. A few days passed and I decided to give it another chance. I picked a song at random and it turned out to be \\"On Mercury\\". I loved it. I couldn't believe I hadn't liked it the first time. And so I decided to listen to the whole album again, and while I didn't like all of the songs, I did start to appreciate them a little more. It took me a little time but I ended up loving this album. I now have it as one of my personal favorites and I now realize that their energy wasn't gone at all, but it had just transformed into something new, while keeping its beauty. Buy it if you have an open mind and desire to listen to truly great and profound music.
0790729725|5.0|This here is another one of Martin Scorsese's masterpieces. This was Scorsese's return to the crime genre after his long time absence from gritty street crime life. Goodfellas is one of the most influential crime films of all time. This film won the academy award for best supporting actor, which went to Joe Pesci who portrayed the psycho gangster Tommy De Vito, despite winning that award, the film should've also garnered the awards for best editing, supporting actress, best director and best picture, but lost out to Dances With Wolves (Scorsese loses out to another bunch of stupid give aways by the academy).<br /><br />This film stars Ray Liotta as the main character Henry Hill an Italian/Irish gangster, Robert De Niro as Jimmy Conway, Joe Pesci as the notorious madman Tommy De Vito, Lorraine Bracco as Karen Hill(Henry's gal), and Paul Sorvino as the big boss Paul Cicero. This film spans over three decades of life in the mafia. We first kickoff the film with Henry, Tommy, and Jimmy driving in the middle of the night when they start hearing strange thudding noises, they eventually pull over and decide to check what's in the trunk, they start getting ready and take out a gun and a knife, once the they open the boot(trunk), we see the first acts of violence of the movie thrown in our faces, the movie is then thrown to the 50's where Henry narrates his reason's why he's always wanted to be a gangster. The movie is narrated through Henry's voice and mind, this movie is basd on true events and he chronicles all the events that happened in the 50's, 60's, 70's and mid 80's. The film, quite simply, is about what life is like in the organised crime ring and does it perfectly. This film is considerd the most accurate orginised crime film ever.<br /><br />Well where can I start? This film is sheer brilliance, you can't possibly go wrong with this title, Scorsese at top flight.<br />Alright, this has one of the best soundtracks around and is a typical Scorsese film when it comes to sounds. The entire film is like one big compilation album, most of the scenes aren't absent with music, I think it's absolutely wonderful, it's like heaven for your ears and let's not forget your eyes. The direction by Scorsese is wonderful, the camera angles, the acting, everything!<br />But one of the best parts of this film is the cinematography, possibly my favourite shots of all time is the tracking shot which follows Henry and Karen going through the clubs back entrance through the kitchens, and passages etc. The acting here is very authentic, as usual De Niro does a great job as mobster Jimmy, Liotta is brilliant as one of the leading roles who goes through the bloody underworld gangsterism. Joe Pesci is the standout, not just because he won an oscar for this role, but he managed to play a brutal, violent madman that was Tommy De Vito, Joe Pesci later played a very similar and ruthless character in another Scorsese Picture called Casino.<br /><br />Overall this film is something you must watch, but you have to have a cast iron stomach to stand the violence and language, if you're very sensitive to those things then you should look elsewhere. Otherwise, if you're just cracking into the cinema thing, then this is one of the films you have to see and have in your collection. An essential film to Casino, Taxi Driver, The Godfathers, Heat, Fargo, Miller's Crossing and Scarface. Even if you don't have any crime films this is one to start with.<br /><br />The extra features are not the best ever, because this was released as some of the first dvds, it has two trailers and production notes. This is a double sided disc, so you have to flip the disc around once the first half is finished. The film: 5/5, the extras: 1/5.ire film is like one big compilation album, most of the scenes aren't absent with music, I think it's absolutely wonderful, it's like heaven for your ears and let's not forget your eyes.

B000E6UK5K|1.0|I've been a David Gilmour fan for years. Spend the money and buy the DVD titled \\"David Gilmour In Concert\\". It's awesome! This CD is a joke. David, you could have done better. It's all about the money is it not? It's all about the money.
B000FFJ85I|4.0|Everyone knows that AFI's new music is very different than their older stuff.  And many people I know haven't even listened to Decemberunderground and said they hated it.  But I kinda know where their coming from.  Admitedly, none of these songs can really blow someone away, they take some getting used to.  Even Miss Murder.  I think many AFI fans like \\"Girl's not Grey\\" more than their new hit, \\"Miss Murder\\".  But Decemberunderground is a good album.<br /><br />Unlike their previous albums, they use many different techniques that make them sound a lot less authentic, with the techno instruments and other sounds and stuff like that.  But in the end, this is still AFI rocking at their best, regardless of whether you like Decemberunderground or not.  And I respect that.  And I think many some other people should too, instead of dissing them cuz they got a new sound.

B0000028PI|4.0|Alice Cooper was one of my favorites that came out of the 1970's and it pained me to see his music drop in quality and power through the early to mid 1980's. <br />Then came \\"Trash,\\" his most commercially successful album in the late 1980's. <br />However, in the Summer of 1994, \\"The Last Temptation\\" came with a force of reckoning.  Teaming up with musicians Tommy Shaw (Styx), Jack Blades (Night Ranger) and Chris Connel (Soundgarden), Alice puts out his best stuff since \\"Goes to Hell.\\" <br />This was his best \\"concept\\" album, accompanied by comic book.  Every song deftly tells a story within a story.  Sideshow is a first-person narrative on teenage boredom.  Free (my favorite) comes from the Showman's point of view, offering freedom for all who come to him (or is it free?)  You're My Temptation is an innovative rocker that presents not only the temptation of lust, but also of life and power.  The turning point is a lament in \\"Stolen Prayer,\\" when the protagonist, tempted by the lure of the show, keeps second-guessing his decision.  It comes into a rocking climax with Cleansed by Fire. <br />Alice Cooper still manages to crank out stuff that seems akin to his vintage 70's material such as Bad Place Alone and Lullaby. <br />Another pleasing aspect was the subtle spiritual overtones present in his music.  While such material still surfaces in his contemporary music, \\"Last Temptation\\" does it with the best consistency. <br />The only drawback were the two tracks, Lost in America and Unholy War which seemed harder than natural.  This is not to say the songs were bad--but that Alice made them a barrage of heavy metal instead of simple rock songs. <br />This is one played every Halloween, right after \\"Goes to Hell.\\"  Why?  The latter, while humorous, is somewhat dark.  \\"Last Temptation,\\" though, ends with a ray of hope.
B0001WGDXA|5.0|Brahms has always been one of my favourite composers and Bernstein and the Vienna PO have done an excellent interpretation of all his Symphonies and especially of the Violin and Double Concerti.  The sound quality for a live recording is also quite okay and this is especially so of the last disc which contains the Concerti.<br /><br />The packaging of a cardboard box which holds the paper sleeves which house the 5 discs is also nice to behold.  You also get a nice 16-page booklet with an essay on Brahms written by Bernstein himself.<br /><br />I was amused to also discover that when it comes to Brahms' symphonies, it appears the 3rd movements are charms when it comes to \\"borrowing\\" the melodies for pop/rock tunes too.  The progressive rock band, Yes, have openly used the 3rd movement of the 4th one as one of the tracks on their wildly successful album, \\"Fragile\\" while if you listen closely to the one from the 3rd Symphony, you'll realise that Santana totally ripped off the melody for the second track on his \\"Supernatural\\" album, \\"Love of My Life\\" with Dave Matthews.  At least Yes had the decency to give the credit to Brahms when they did it though.<br /><br />This box set though comes highly recommended.
B00003CX5P|2.0|It's not fair to compare this 'new' story with the OT, but unfortunately its nearly impossible not to do so.  In trying to put that aside as much as I can, I am firm in my belief that if Lucas had rolled this movie out to introduce us to the world of Star Wars, the world's most recognizable movie franchise would have never gotten off the ground.   <br /> <br />No doubt it would have enjoyed some moderate success, but The Phantom Menace is more akin to the uneven efforts of Stargate or Dune than his own earlier work.  And let us remember that if the tremendous, unprecedented success of the original Star Wars (now Episode IV), made those other movies possible.  That's the type of impact it had on Hollywood and popular culture.  This installment is Darth Vader in movie form, a soulless shadow of its former self. <br /> <br />What are the reasons for this?  I will sum up a few. <br /> <br />#1: The Story.  George wrote this one himself, as he did ANH (mostly).  That story was lifted from the Hidden Fortress, as is well known.  Nothing wrong with that.  He took a great story, adapted it, and turned it into gold.  Perhaps Lucas couldn't find another Kurosawa film for inspiration.  More likely, he has forgotten from whence his inspiration came and thought it was all of his own doing.  Not so, and The Phantom Menace demonstrates that.   <br /> <br />Some fans might (and do) call this film complex and subtle, I would opt for confused, stilted and often boring.  Is this a movie that employs juvenile fart jokes or a tale of intrigue and deception that introduces a great saga?  Although many have accused George of greed or laziness, a more telling reason for his approach comes from an interview with Lucas' former producer Gary Kurtz. (they parted ways after ESB).  According to Gary, after the runaway success of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Lucas became convinced that the American (read: dumb) movie audience had no appreciation for deep moving stories, and it was only the \\"roller-coaster\\" ride that mattered.  Thus his complaints at the efforts put into making ESB the best of the SW series, and the cheap and empty thrills of ROTJ and the PT.  The sad thing is, I think he gave us what he really thought we wanted.   <br /> <br />#2: Poor direction.  A more competant director would have eeked out something better from the weak script. George did an adequate job with the original because it was a pretty straight forward linear plot with very defined roles of good and evil.  The 'muddiness' of TPM highlights Lucas' weaknesses, which include nuance and emotion, oh, and dialouge.  That BOTH the script and the direction suffer from the same weakness is like marrying your cousin.  The result ain't pretty. <br /> <br />He got lousy performances from Ewan, Natalie, Samuel freakin' Jackson. To turn Oscar-worthy actors into cyborgs takes some pretty substantial anti-talent.  He has apparently not grown much since his \\"faster and more intense\\" days.  Poor Jake suffered the most at Lucas' ham-fisted directing sensibilities, but everyone is force to muddle through his \\"no one in the history of ANY galaxy has ever talked like this\\" dialouge.  Liam Neeson proved his mettle by being the only human in the bunch. <br /> <br />It is NO COINCIDENCE that the movie Lucas had the LEAST control over turned out to the best one.  He needs to stick to the FX unit or editing room. <br /> <br />It seems the most positive words have been for the technical aspects of the movie: sound, visuals, special effects, etc.  While dutifully impressed, I too often felt that the story and characters were upstaged by CG that served no purpose other than to be CG.  They all scream \\"HEY LOOK AT ME, I'M WAY COOL!  HOW DID THEY MAKE ME?\\"  The captivating answer?  They drew it on the computer, then colored it in.  YIPPEE. <br /> <br />All that said, if you are able to mentally mute the ridiculous Jar-Jar and forgive Jake Lloyd, The Phantom Menace turns out to be the most watchable (or least offensive) of the PT movies.  Ian McDiarmind is perfectly weasely, and the 3-way lightsaber duel was the best of any of the 6, despite the weak ending. The Phantom Menace is a small story told against a much larger background that's out there waiting for us to discover it. The film holds out the hope that there will be better, larger stories to be told in this universe.  Too bad we have to wait until Episode IV for that to happen.
0553208845|4.0|What a book!<br />It describes in very simple words the self discovery path of Siddhartha. It shows us how we all falter on this difficult path but also how-if we don't get discouraged-we will win. The story is simple and convincing. It also talks about love and friendship. The book is very easy to read and the story very inspiring!
B00000F14B|4.0|Terrific piece of Americana, enhanced by Preston's bravado and Wilson's witty script and score. Comic touches abound, and the film's resolution actually has a bit of zing! One of two films guaranteed to bring me to tears, time and time again. Who wouldn't want to be Harold Hill?

B00007JVBI|4.0|It is never entirely certain what Chan Marshall (\\"Cat Power\\") is singing about, even on the songs she \\"covers\\" (rather, deconstructs entirely, picking and choosing amongst the lyrics until they are some sort of found art almost unrecognizable to the original author). This album is probably her best, where she dumped the last vestiges of her punk-ish early music and went straight minimalist melancholy, without the ornations that hide the bones of The Greatest. She never has drums where a few chords will do. She never has chords where a single note would do. The only constant is her smoky voice, singing enigmatic lyrics that often obscure more than inform. <br /> <br />The result is hauntingly beautiful, like the Southern landscape from which Chan came, with the exception of \\"Names\\" which is simply chilling. Is any of it true? Does it really matter? When she sings \\"we can all be free/maybe not with words/maybe not with a look/but with your mind\\", does she believe it, or is she being ironic? It's never entirely clear what Chan's up to, but it is an experience that stands repeated listening well.
B00005JOML|3.0|These three words describe how this film is trying to move away from being very cheesy and fluffy-like that '80s Cop Show. This happens to be a dark, intense, and graphically violent big-screen version of Michael Mann's TV classic. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx have finally took over the roles that made famous by Don Johnson & Phillip Michael Thomas-Crockett & Tubbs. They did it without the hype or the flashy pastels. This Movie Kicks But-Just like \\"Scarface\\" & All 3 \\"The Fast & the Furious\\" Films.
B000000OA6|5.0|I bought this album on cassette tape when it originally came out.  Of course, all Queen albums must be preserved on CD so I bought it again.  What a powerful piece of work!  The hard-rocking \\"Headlong\\" and the amazing \\"Show Must Go On!\\"  Sure, it also has \\"Delilah,\\" but trust me, it grows on you!  It's amazing knowing that this album was recorded in Freddie's last days!  His voice is strong and nimble as always.  This album is a \\"Must Have!\\"
0618001905|5.0|While only the most naive today would contend that the European colonization of Africa occurred for purely altruistic reasons, atrocities and subterfuge on the scale presented by Adam Hochschild in King Leopold's Ghost give even the jaded cynic pause.  That such base greed carefully done up as humanitarianism managed to inflict so much suffering for so long almost takes one's breath away.<br /><br />Hochschild presents the story of King Leopold II and his determination to establish some sort of empire for himself.  Hochschild makes clear that Leopold's ambition centered upon himself; if Belgium or his family profited as a result, that was secondary to the King.  Leopold emerges as a master schemer and conniver, adept at seeing a profit where most would pass by and skilled at manipu-lating even the most damaging turns to events to suit his own agenda.<br /><br />Writing more as a journalist than as a traditionally trained historian, Hochschild spins a gripping story that compels the reader like a novel.  Had the work turned out to be a roman &aacute; clef, it would not have been surprising.  Indeed his cast of players offer fascinating insights into characters that Dickens would have been proud to have created.  Besides Leopold, Henry Stanley is the villain on the spot, whose cruelty and butchery mesmerize with the macabre lure that the cobra holds over its prey.  Furthermore, L&egrave;on Rom appears as the real life monster on whom Joseph Conrad based Mr. Kurtz, in The Heart of Darkness.  Unfortunately, what makes brilliant villains in fiction, makes for genuine horror in reality.<br /><br />Despite the often grisly and lurid information Hochschild has to convey, he manages to do so as tastefully as possible yet still impresses the reader with the grim conditions that prevailed in the Congo.  The beatings with the chicotte and the severing of hands burn vividly in the reader's mind.  Besides Hochschild's descriptive skill, the various illustrations make clear the tragic plight of Africans who failed to comply with Belgian demands.<br /><br />However, as promised in the subtitle, the story has its heroes as well.  Joseph Conrad personally saw European cruelty at work and voiced his horror of the situation in The Heart of Darkness.  E. D. Morel, who crusaded tirelessly on behalf of the Africans caught in Leopold's web displays sacrifice and altruism on a vast scale - the only scale that could possibly match the iniquity on the side of Leopold and his agents.  Sir Roger Casement, the Irishman with a fondness for lost causes and martyrdom, managed to aid the Congolese before getting himself embroiled in even more hopeless causes like Irish independence and uncloseted homosexuality.  Hochschild also presents blacks as heroic agents for resistance, notably George Washington Williams, Hezekiah Andrew Shanu and Reverend William H. Sheppard.  These men fearlessly proclaimed the wrongs being perpetrated in the Congo and insisted that it not be ignored.<br /><br />Hochschild contends that only through the efforts of men brave enough to speak out against Leopold and his tribe did the evil system of oppression yield to more humanitarian methods.  Leopold, he asserts, would have continued his sordid ways as long as possible and abrogated them only when the scrutiny of the world's attention made their continuance intolerable.<br /><br />In the final section of the book, Hochschild addresses the larger issues, which are:  why is any amount of atrocity tolerable at all, and how are atrocities so easily forgotten or ignored?  Regrettably, his answers do not reflect favorably upon humanity.  Self-serving ends combined with guilt or complicity lead to collective forgetfulness and, eventually, ignorance.  The harsh light of self-examination seldom appeals to any but the most saintly of us while politicians offering salves to assuage our shame easily convince us that it is better not to dwell upon it.  Fortunately, writers like Hochschild force themirror before us and reveal humanity in both its ignominy and its heroism.before us and reveal humanity in both its ignominy and its heroism. <br />

B000002KDS|5.0|From the very first chords of \\"Under My Wheels\\" to \\"Killer\\" this album rocks.  Favorite would have to be \\"Halo Of Flies\\", just because it's so different from what Alice had done in prior albums, but readies you for \\"Unfinished Sweets\\" on \\"Billion Dollar Babies\\" (BDB).   <br /> <br />Under My Wheels - hard rocking, get moving song <br /> <br />Be My Lover - they asked me why the singers name was Alice, I said listen baby, you really wouldn't understand.  Oh yeah! <br /> <br />Halo of Flies - longer song, allows more latitude in music 10 stars! <br /> <br />Desperado - slow it down a couple notches <br /> <br />You Drive Me Nervous - I think this song and the next wear on you.  Not bad at beginning, but compared to others on album... <br /> <br />Yeah, Yeah, Yeah - Beatles did better with these three words, but I combine with You Drive Me Nervous  <br /> <br />Dead Babies - back in '71 walking around singing \\"Dead babies can't take care of themselves\\" shocking our parents.  But that is what Alice wanted us all to do anyway.... plus getting us ready for \\"I Love The Dead\\" on \\"BDB\\". <br /> <br />Killer - Upbeat music with downbeat lyrics until the end, then the death scene.  Excellent way to end the album!  Drum roll, haunting music, last rites and execution.  Pure Alice Cooper. <br /> <br />But what did you expect from a Bob Ezra produced album?  Excellence!
B000FILW86|5.0|This is easily the best and most consistant CHEAP TRICK album since 1979's incredible \\"Dream Police.\\" I've liked most of their output since, but it's been a hit-and-miss affair for the most part. <br /> <br />On \\"Rockford\\" however, the band sounds like a bunch of young upstarts - fresh and completely ready to rock. Right out of the gate the fun starts with the romping \\"Welcome To The World\\" - classic Cheap Trick all the way. From that point onward \\"Rockford\\" stays the course. I completely agree with another reviewer that stated that they sound like they are just \\"having fun being Cheap Trick!\\" <br /> <br />\\"Come On Come On Come On,\\" \\"This Time You Got It,\\" \\"Give It Away,\\" \\"One More\\" and the Beatlesque \\"O Claire\\" keep the fun rolling along at a quick pace that never allows the listener to catch their breath. When Robin, Rick, Tom and Bun E. get into a groove like they are here, there are few bands can touch them. <br /> <br />Take a trip to \\"Rockford\\" where it all started over 30 years ago. It's fun, it's fresh, and most of all it's rockin! Enjoy your stay.
B000F1IQN2|1.0|Way back in 1986, HBO Films did a movie called \\"Sword of Gideon\\" that also dealt with the 1972 Munich Olympics massacre, and its bloody aftermath. Sure, it was a made-for-cable TV movie, and they didn't have the big budget that Steven Spielberg had, but the movie was TEN TIMES BETTER than his!! Why? It simply told the truth about what happened!! (Now there's a concept!!)    Sadly, Spielberg didn't have the guts to tell the truth. Hell, he wouldn't touch it with a 10 ft. poll!! Instead, he chose to be politically correct, and kiss as much arse and he could get his lips on, so that everybody would like him. At the end of the day, though, the only thing that happened was that everybody just shook their heads in disgust. In short, if you want to purchase a movie that truthfully shows the events surrounding the 1972 massacre in Munich during the summer Olympics, steer clear of this disgusting embarassment and go for \\"Sword of Gideon\\".  It's cheaper, it ain't a bunch of lies, and the acting & writing are top notch.
B000A3DFZE|2.0|That's what I feel after listening to this album... blah. <br />I tried very hard to find this record's groove, but easy listening music is not my thing. EC the guitar God is most certainly alseep if not totally dead. The few times I heard his Stratocaster come alive, the noose was tightened and the tone was killed off before it had a chance to make a difference.  <br />The music itself is lackluster and uninspiring. There are no stand-out tracks, and every song sounds like it could have been  written by any amateur songwriter. With such a great backing band and top-notch guests, this record should have caught fire and burned strong. The only thing notable on the whole album is the nice production.  <br />To me it looks like EC has lost his hunger and passion for music and playing.  <br />Very sad.
B00005NKK8|4.0|I love this collection of songs by the most representative, soulful artists of their respective eras. It isn't sappy or morose. Like the movie, it takes you in and holds you gently for just long enough before returning you to the reality of today.
0393307050|5.0|Having first read \\"Far Side of the World\\" because my first exposure to the series was through the movie, I knew I would enjoy this novel.  What I didn't expect was that the movie owed as much to this, first, book as to \\"Far Side of the World.\\" <br /> <br />The world is in the midst of war between England and France. We are introduced to Captain Jack Aubrey and his surgeon, Stephen Maturin.  It's good character development, a good introduction to life in the Royal Navy, and the action is engaging.   <br /> <br />The language takes some getting used to; O'Brian did a good job of making the dialogue period-appropriate, and wrote the rest of the book in the same vein.  Even so, it's a page-turner, and I was left looking forward to the next book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Why didnt i know about this when it was on TV?  And how could they have cancelled it when so many pathetic, boring and predictable series rule the airwaves?  Does anyone know what it would take for Joss Whedon to contine?  What happens?  Please don't tell me Serendipidity was the end of the story.  Joss Whedon is indisputably one of the most imaginative and interesting writers on TV and the movies.
078322737X|5.0|This is one of the anchor movies for any fan of americana.  This is the start of so many things that made the 70's and 80's movies special and started George Lucas in the film industry.  It showed the talent the creator of Star Wars had in it's depth and reality of emotion and life in the 50's of America.  I love this movie.
B000BW7QX6|5.0|A story in the best science fiction tradition.  Lets your imagination loose but never with that cynical \\"Yeah, right\\" feeling.  Fascinating story and characters that make you care and want to know more.  I immediately went out and bought Firefly to find out the backstory.
0786838655|4.0|I have found in the past number of years that children's fantasy is often on par or better than \\"adult\\" fantasy. And I think that is because fantasy is generally best when whismical, imaginative, and free from \\"adult things.\\" <br /> <br />\\"The Lightning Theif\\" is a fun read that, while derrivitive, manages to both engage the reader in the characters and their lives, and a thrill-a-minute plot. Unless you've managed to live your life without reading the Harry Potter series it is impossible to not see the inspiration here. The other big comparrison I would draw is probably not intentional on the author's part as the series is fairly unknown. But there are definite parallels here to the Dragons In Our Midst series by Bryan Davis, which has a kid realizing that he is half human, half dragon. So while Riordan probably never read those, there are definitely similar aspects to the two series. <br /> <br />Percy Jackson, our main character, is what society would called \\"troubled.\\" He disagrees, but that doesn't prevent him from getting shipped from school to school. And then something happens that will change his world forever. He finds out that his father was not a mortal-- but a god. <br /> <br />Riordan rides the fine line between character development and plot development. I've read many decent fantasy books that rely heavily on plot at the expense of allowing the characters to wither. And while I prefer books that lean heavily on character, this one does a good job of being very plotty, while also aquanting me with Percy and his friends, Grover and Annabeth.  <br /> <br />I have two complaints about the book which knock it from a five start to four. The first, and perhaps least important, is the occational pointless foreshadowing. For example, at the end of chapter seven he writes, \\"I wish I'd known how briefly I would get to enjoy my new home.\\" It does nothing to drive the story forward or paint a better picture of our hero. It just creates an artifical sense of urgency. <br /> <br />The second complaint is how Riordan takes an essential part of the plot, and then gives us hints above and beyond the point of sanity until the point where we scream, \\"Yes! We GET it! This aspect is essential! There is no surprise about this anymore!\\" For example, in the beginning when they don't know which god fathered Percy, it is very obvious what his talent is-- but Riordan keeps on pointing it out while everyone else, Percy included, is still fairly clueless. Finally they \\"figure it out,\\" and what should be a big reveal that goes off with a bang is just simply, \\"ok. they got it. finally!\\" So i don't know if Riordan is underestimating his readers... or if he's just not thinking about it. But it happens several other times with various things and it is aggervating. <br /> <br />But beyond that, this is a solid book that I definitely recommend.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is so GREAT!!  I loved every minute of it.  It brought back so many memories.  I may have to go buy the game again.  The fight scenes are fast paced and exciting to watch.  The voices are just right for the characters.  The only small glitch it between the voiceovers and lip movement.  But that is to be expected.  If you loved the game you'll love the movie.  No fan should be without it.
B000GUJZ4G|4.0|Review <br /> <br />A gang of Southern California surfers tear up the waves, while enjoying the sun, sand and the sea. But in their spare time they also double up as Bank robbers and commit their crimes masked as American presidents. The gang led by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze)have been making some serious hits.  <br /> <br />Finally the law in the form of FBI agent Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves) and his partner, Pappas (Gary Busey)suspect the sand lovers and decide to infiltrate them by going undercover. <br /> <br />Throw in skydiving, some pretty boy male bonding action and a little bit of love into this cocktail, this turns out to be a pretty decent film. The acting is saved with good pacing and a commendable script; which is not as predictable as 1 might think.  <br /> <br />It's worth a watch, definetly!!! <br /> <br />The Dvd <br /> <br />The film itself will be presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen, along with both English Dolby Digital 5.1 and 4.0 Dolby Surround tracks. <br /> <br /> Extras will include deleted scenes (Holistic Fitness With Agent Pappas, Agent Johnny Utah Thinks He Can Surf, Tyler Saves Johny From The Waves, Penetration Of The Social Infrastructure, Tyler & Johnny Spend Time Alone In The Water, A Basic Hit & Run, Tyler Accuses Johnny Of Using Her, and Johnny & Bodhi Talk About Robbing Banks), an It's Make or Break featurette, a Ride the Wave featurette, an Adrenaline Junkies featurette, an On Location: Malibu featurette, a still gallery, and three theatrical trailers <br /> <br />++ Though the inital dvd loses the DTS track.. the DTS track was horrendous in the 1st place...So for me personally, i'd rather not have it....
0307276902|5.0|A Million Little Pieces. Wow. Now, I know all about the controversy behind this book, that it is fabricated and partially made up and partially untrue. To be honest, i couldnt care less. The meaning is still there and it is a beautiful one. This book is beautiful. It is one of the most powerful and beautiful books i've ever read, and part of me is sad that i finished it because i loved it so much. If you've been an addict, you understand this book. If you know someone who is an addict, you understand them better. This book brought out every emotion there could possibly be. I cried five times. This book is powerful and insightful and so the message is so true that it hurts. I love this book. And anyone who doesn't is too critical or has no soul. Stay strong james!
B00005JN0T|4.0|This movie was more than I expected. I was astonished at the amazing graphic and effects, and especially, the robots. You are kept wondering who the true villian is until the very end. I did not expect it to be who it was. The reason why I rated this movie a four instead of a five was for the almost constant swearing from Smith. I was not prepared for it, especially since the movie is not rated PG-13 for language. Other than that, I highly recommend this movie.
0393327655|5.0|I'm in danger of mounting a soapbox, but I think you will find The End of Faith by Sam Harris to be a remarkable and riveting book.  Cannot recall how I learned of it, but I read it straight through earlier this month on the 10+ hour flight from Newark to Tel Aviv.  It's \\"Socratic\\" and radical, along with being exceptionally well written.  Irrespective of one's outlook on religion(s) or spirituality, Sam Harris's work is in the \\"must read\\" category.  If I were the publisher, I'd offer a moneyback guarantee.  Perfect choice for any reading group.<br /><br />Ignore the negative reviews - this book should be on the required reading list in our High Schools and Colleges.  Harris's background in both religion and science provides more than an adequate pedigree - he's the real deal - an intellectual whose head isn't in the clouds.  He tackles religion, terror, and the future of reason head on.  Hard to imagine a more timely work given every day's headlines.  This is a great book.
1401300901|4.0|I expected this to be a light read and was surprised to find how moving it turned out to be.  A very clever plot adds to this touching story about a woman recovering from the death of her beloved husband.  It is a little too sugary in many instances but that does not take away from the overall effect of the book.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I know many of you are fans of the BBC version and I liked it too. And although this remake had its flaws (acting, costuming, some details incorrect), there is one thing that this remake had that, in my opinion, BBC lacked - emotion.  By the end of the movie, I felt that these characters were in love, I felt that Jane was truly happy after her proposal.  I didn't feel any of that during the BBC version.  The story here may not have been told as thoroughly as other versions of this story, but I thought it was told better.
0618001905|5.0|Hochschild is an excellent writer with something very worthwhile to tell us about the terrible colonial history of the Congo.

B000GYI32M|3.0|There are four people to thank for saving The OC from cancellation and those four are Peter Gallagher, Adam Brody, Rachel Bilson and Kelly Rowan. These four tremendous actors make a lifeless season of an entertaining, sometimes brilliant show seem great. <br />Some people not to thank: the writers, Mischa Barton for her terrible acting, Ben McKenzie for brooding and making awkward smiles and Tate Donavan for making his character more of a looser than he's written. <br />Why is this season so lifeless? Well, for one thing, a plethora of new characters that pale in comparsion to Anna and even Oliver are added. Characters like Johnny, Chillie and the non-charcter Volcheck, who really is just a mime that punches and broods.  <br />The dialogue also looses its wit. Yes, Brody, Gallagher and the rest of the Cohen clan are still very funny, but their dialogue has none of the snap, crackle and pop of Season 1 and even Season 2.  <br />The new music also is rather annoying. It sounds like one note is being played throughout an entire scene. <br />And finally, the stories. The show starts off with some interesting plot lines for the adults and even gives Kirsten Cohen a touching moment at AA (later in the season). But the kids are constantly have new idiots being thrown at them. The only character who is the saving grace of the show is the kinda new character of Marissa's sister, Katlin. The character, a teenage sexpot, seems like an interesting addtion. The stories, which are just rehashes of previous ones (without decent dialouge) are boring. The only saving grace of a story lines were the ones that involved Sandy's hospital dream and Brody's drug use. <br />And I'm forgetting one more thing, the character of Taylor who really bugs me. I don't know why. She just seems wrong for th show. The actress who plays her does fine with the part, I just don't like the character. <br />With the death of the awful character of Marissa played by the bland Mischa Barton (whom must take acting lessons), hopefully the fourth season will bring new beginnings to the show. I'm curious and excited to see what Marrissa's sister will bring to the show and what antics Brody will pull. I'm also interested in seeing how Sandy and Kirsten develop. Mr. Gallagher and Ms. Rowan have been overlooked for three years at the Emmys for these strong performances. <br />I'm also curious if Ryan will kill himself after the death of his love Marissa. That might help the show too.  <br />
B000002MUN|5.0|I recently picked up Tom Petty's new cd, \\"Highway Companion\\"--which is excellent--but for me, this is the cd where I truly was won over and became a fan of his. I wasn't even alive when Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers started out 30 years ago but I think this cd is appealing on so many levels regardless of age. This cd truly is one of the best albums to come out within the last 20 years. <br /> <br />Most people probably know \\"Wildflowers\\" for the song \\"You Don't Know How It Feels\\", which is certainly one of the best tracks on the album, but there are a number of other gems that make this cd worth buying. \\"You Wreck Me\\" offers Petty in classic form on a rock number that has a great guitar riff. But there are many other songs on this cd that sound a bit different from the man who brought us \\"Refugee\\" and \\"American Girl\\". The best of these more mid-tempo and slower songs are the title track, \\"Don't Fade on Me\\", \\"It's Good To Be King\\", \\"It's Only a Broken Heart\\" and \\"Crawling Back to You\\" (my favorite). Many of these songs focus on love, but it's not just heartbreak but also he expresses hope (If you follow your feelings/And you follow your dreams/You might find a forest there in the trees). The more simplistic, acoustic guitar-playing approach works wonderfully on so many of these songs, this cd consisently gets better with every listen. <br /> <br />This is without a doubt, from top to bottom, my favorite cd that I own and I never get tired of listening to it. This is the type of cd that once you hear it, you want to share it with everyone you know. I'd even go so far as to say that when I have kids someday I want to share this with them. This is probably the only cd that I have where anybody that I mentioned it to felt similarly about it. I dare you to not find at least one song on this cd that stays with you long after you stop listening to it. <br /> <br />
B0009WFFS6|5.0|One of the best concerts ever recorded on film.Audio is crystal clear .They play almost all their songs(like clapton says).A bit slower than 1968 but  much tighter.

I got to see the follow up at The Garden in 05 and it was exactly the same witch is a good thing because i wouldnt change a thing.
0345347951|4.0|There are at least three issues Clarke comments on: religion, sex & romance, and politics.  In the novel, he discounts the major religions and their accounts of God as they're believed on Earth.  Considering how sketchy their beliefs are based on, this is not a large stretch of the imagination.  But Clarke then goes on to state that sexual attitudes (this published in 1953) will be drastically changed in the future by two things: effective oral contraceptives and the ability to do DNA testing.  These now already exist; so has everyone's sexual situation drastically improved due to being able to determine if one's wife or girlfriend has slept with someone else since her newborn child has been determined to have been fathered by someone else.  Clarke also sounds like quite a worldly person when he chastises a young male for being crestfallen for having lost a love when everyone knows humans are polygamous.  So it's disheartening then after this sophisticated comment to have him write with such a naive and romantic attitude on the Soviet Union.  The Soviet Union is an entity that murdered 20 million people in the 20th century.  There's a statement on the copyright page that states: \\"The opinions expressed in this book are not those of the author.\\" as if that justifies what he's written.  If he gave such a positive slant to Nazism, would you think many people would be appeased by such a statement.  He makes so many references to metaphors, that it's not clear if the final ending is supposed to be some sort of allegory or metaphor to humanity.  That possibly the secrecy of the Overlords was not a problem in the final analysis so the secrecy of a totalitarian state is justified or something.  He makes comments to a world statehood, scoffing at democracy as well, at the beginning as being a conduit to a new world order and then the events of the novel occur, so is Clarke trying to make some allegory? <br /> <br />However, when you get past Clarke's preaching is when the novel really shines.  It's a fluid and engrossing read.  When the Overlords arrive to Earth, they hide their appearance for an extended period of time, and when they're described you understand why they felt their need to do so.  However, Clarke takes this and uses it as a theme throughout the book.  After continuous hints at some ulterior motive of the Overlords, there's an event in the novel during a dinner party, and a very 50's party, where it hinted at what the Overlords are on Earth for and it's an almost stunning revelation.  Many of those in science would like to believe in something `more'.  Science by the way is not a religion, it is a doctrine based on observation of repeatable experiments.  The sun rises every day due to planetary physics.  If some unusual event such as an eclipse can occur, it can be explained, and future eclipses for the next thousand years or so have been calculated by scientists.  The space shuttle isn't launched and landed due to group prayers, it launched and landed by a group of dedicated people working very hard.  The evidence for evolution is overwhelming in the fossil records.  National Geographic, possibly the most mainstream of all magazines, recently wrote an article overwhelmingly in favor of evolution.  And so it should be, because it wasn't based on any belief, merely on the evidence.  Science attempts to explain the natural universe based on repeatable experimentation and observation.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Sure this may sound emotionless, but that's the point.  Emotions are used for loved ones, for family, etc.  Science is there to attempt to explain the universe.  Period.  However.... there are some in the scientific field, and possibly many, that would like to believe in something `more'.  And Clarke takes this and explains it within the science of his novel.  That's what makes this a worthy reading.  He deals with the philosophical questions of what is our reason for being here, where do we go from here, what'sthe point of it all.  The title of Clarke's book is perhaps the best and most apt title within science fiction.  However, it can be considered only One Type of Childhood's End.  It can also be seen as a Childhood's Beginning.  Perhaps Clarkes' best line of the novel is when he states that if and when man has attained something more, where does he then go from there!  Does he then look for something beyond that and another Childhood's End.  Is man only happy when he's in a childlike state, shaking rattles or spinning spherical objects before him, as the whole universe at that level lays before him.
B0006L16N8|1.0|this album did not do it for me, it was really quite horrible, only 1 song is good and the rest sound the same and have no rhythm or purpose
B00009V7T2|5.0|The Mars Volta sound like nobody on earth, and nobody on earth sounds like The Mars Volta. They are a spastic and off-the-wall group that crosses musical genres from jazz to punk to prog rock to experimentation and back again. The instrumentation on this album is flawless and top notch artistry. The lyrics and vocals are amazing and will pierce the very soul of your fragile existence. The vocals range from beautiful crooning to shrieking falsetto, to lovely rhythms. <br /> <br /> In between songs, you are treated to electronic dub sounding interludes that add an eerie atmosphere to the already esoteric and mysterious album. Each song is a musical landscape of wonder and raw, intense emotion that will blow you away and re-define your vision of music and \\"acceptable\\" musical theory.  <br /> <br />I was turned on to The Mars Volta through Frances the Mute, and a couple of my friends popped in De-loused and commented \\"This is way better than Frances the Mute\\". I personally disagree with that statement, I feel that Frances the Mute is better. But this moment is not one to compare. This moment is to revel in the glory and awesomness that is De-loused in the Comatorium, a CD of utter perfection.  <br /> <br />If you have not yet heard The Mars Volta, you are missing out on a true sonic experience that will change the way you view music forever. Great Genre bending prog music is hard to come by, and many bands try and fail. Mile Davis had it perfected, if not doing the strangest and most wacked out version of it. The Mars Volta have perfected it and our generation is better because of it.  <br /> <br />If your wondering which Mars Volta album to pick up first(De-loused or Fances the Mute), De-loused is the more \\"normal\\" of the two. And when I say normal I mean the album with less experimentation and more regular musical structure. Frances might scare you away, but if your into a heavily laden, sonic concept album of massive proportions, then pick up Frances the Mute first.It doesn't really matter, because I know that you will eventually pick up everything that The Mars Volta has to offer....just wait until you hear Amputecture......
B000B8QEZG|5.0|this cd is great if you like to dance, it is more traditional maddona like from the 80s, where she just created great music to dance to <br /> <br />

B00003CXB4|5.0|this movie was incredable. i don't understand how people can dislike this film. this movie's deep and intense story made it great for children AND their parents, a feat rarely accomplished. but rather than stay depressing and traumatizing, this film goes from drama to side-splitting humor within 13 seconds. the best part is that this is all done with seemless perfection. <br /> <br />the music, which is a key element in any disney film, is great here. although it doesnt' have that distinct broadway feel to it, it is still very strong. it's power and brilliance comes from something eles entirely, and i'm not even sure what. <br /> <br />in the end though, this is one of disney's greatest efforts. the clean, brilliant animation, the flawless story, adn the increadable music all come together for something truely spectacular. the only sad thing is that this became the begining of the end for disney animation. so treasure this gem, because from here on out, it's all downhill. :(
B00005JKNC|4.0|All I hear from people is that they didn't like it because he was too serious in this film. You know Jim Carrey is an actor and actors have alot more to offer than just comedy movies. This movie was good altough long it was good either ways. I think this was Jim's second best performance next to Eternal Sunshine. And if you don't like that movie either then maybe you are not the Jim Carrey fan you thought you were. Jim's a good comidian but he is a good actor that should never limit his acting to only comedy.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|where to begin!! this is without a doubt the greatest disney film EVER! there are no negative elements to this masterpiece. the story is a clever and well done adaptation of another classic fairy tale. the storyline is well executed because not once does it dumb down it's romantic love story for small children. with strong leading characters and well developed supporting ones, this is truely a great film. the animation is so realistic it is always beautiful in every detail and in every way. <br /> <br />now i get to the music. WOW!!! this is a fantastic score, possibly one of the greatest musical scores of all time. the intensity and passion of every song is unbelievable for any movie, let alone a disney film. the songs themselves have a wonderful broadway feel and are all catchy and unique. again they are all powerful and fun. <br /> <br />Although i'm just a little biased, this movie deserved to win the oscar for best motion picture, and i don't know why it didnt. as i said, this is a great film in the disney cannon and on it's own. this is truely the best of the best!
B000002C25|5.0|This is a difficult album to review. People either embrace it or pass it off as an overproduced, overblown waste of their time. However, I can say that this is my favorite Oasis album. Why? That's a very good question...maybe because Be Here Now was my introduction to Oasis, and I could tell that this band had a lot to offer, even through the drug-addled, overproduced songs that seemed to last forever. Each one is very catchy and has an overall feel-good quality to it, two characteristics of most Oasis songs.  <br /> <br />It's no use comparing Be Here Now to Morning Glory or Def. Maybe, because it's in a whole other ballpark. This is Oasis going totally over the top and pushing their music to the limit. No doubt that all the coke helped with that. It's my firm belief that Morning Glory and Def. Maybe were and still are great albums in their own rights. Be Here Now is just something else, you either love it or hate it. It has it's own little Oasis category. I can see why it never really lived up to its two famous predecessors. <br /> <br />There are some valid complaints about this album, though. One, it is very very overproduced, filled to the top with snarling buzzing guitars and who knows what else. Unfortunately, this makes it hard to listen to with earphones for very long. Two, the songs are astonishingly long at times. All Around the World, while an excellent song, clocks in at around 9:20. I believe that the shortest song is I Hope, I Think, I Know, coming in at 4:23. So you know you're in for a long, wild ride.  <br /> <br />However, only Oasis could pull this off - making ridiculously long songs that are almost ear-numbing to listen to - and every minute is made enjoyable. All the arrogance, coke, and swagger in these songs is perhaps what makes it so appealing to some people. And of course, there's that small note on the upper left-hand corner of pages 7 and 8 in the booklet that proclaims : \\"The Beatles are quite good, but Oasis is much better.\\" <br /> <br />And so a resounding yes to all of these: overproduced, arrogant, drug-induced, staggering, amazing, excellent. I don't care about the negative things, though, because that's what makes Be Here Now a sucess in its own right.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B8QEYC|3.0|The CD is good but not as enjoyable as the two I previously bought.
6302753295|5.0|To make this simple, Any fan of the Duke will love this movie. It has one great scene after another mixing comedy, light drama, and one fine story line. Buy two copies: one for viewing and another as a backup for when the first one wears out. Grade \\"A\\" entertainment!     C Archibald
B0007GAEGC|3.0|The CD is good but not as enjoyable as seeing them on TV.

B000FP2Z0S|4.0|OK so first let me preface this review by saying that I absolutely love Rise Against...Siren Song is a 10/10 if I've ever heard one, if you don't own it I highly recommend it. This album on the other hand is a really great album that took a little while to grow on me...it started out as a 7-7.5 at best, but now I like it much more, probably an 8.5-9. I think what put me off a little initially is that Siren Song started so strong and this one didnt have that intitial kickoff punch, it was more melodic, less raw. Don't get me wrong though there are still some great tracks and they do some interesting things musically and artistically on this album.    I see some paralells with Strung Out. Strung Out are a band that seems to get expoentially better with each album to the point where you can't believe it possible for them to do it once again. But remember when The Element of Sonic Defiance came out a couple years after Twisted By Design? As good as it was I always felt Twisted was the stronger album...it flowed better somehow. I suspect this is the case with this Rise Against release. So by all means pick this one up, just don't expect another Siren Song and you'll get alot more out of it I think.
0131479415|4.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone, like myself, that is looking to move towards more agile approaches to software development.  Obviously, Agile has its place, as other methodologies have their place.  This book has allowed me to refine my approach to a significant effort that hopefully will help our transition from a rigid waterall approach to a more flexible adaptive approach.<br /><br />One of the nice things about this book is that it lays our in detail how to get through the planning, requirements, and daily development cycles necessary to be sucessful.<br /><br />Also a very easy read.  Very comprehensible.

B000002UB3|5.0|What are the basic principles when writing a book? First, the introduction is written (Please Please Me...with an invitation), then the body (Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band...with a climax) and finally, the conclusion (Abbey Road...and in the end, the love you make is equal to the love you take, with an encore, Her Majesty, and a bow.) <br />The Beatles...Les Beat...The Beat!  <br />Noboby, but nobody, is better! And Abbey Road is a testament to that fact. This masterpiece is similar to the final episode in the Bible, the book of Revelation. It has all of the components of the Beatles music library wrapped into one conclusive picture.  <br />Pop, rap (yes, rap!), psychedelic, jazz, blues, country and classical is what defined the Beatles throughout their musical career. Abbey Road has all of these components which is why it was the best selling Beatles album, ever! <br />Want to know who the Beatles were? Buy Abbey Road. Aquire a taste for greatness. Then, begin with the beginning, like you would the Bible and end again with the end. You will appreciate what a generation appreciated not long ago! <br />
B0002EXH5O|5.0|This by far is the best thrash metal album to ever grace the speakers of stereos on this planet. This album is pure perfection from opening note to the closing second of the disc. I can absolutely find not even the slightest thing that could've been done differently to improve this album, other than maybe more songs.There is no album that can or in my opinion ever will top this. This is a metal milestone and Dave Mustaine my hat is off to you!!!!!!!! That said, the vocals from my understanding had to be redone on some songs on this and on the \\"So Far So Good So What\\" album due to a bad batch of tape that Megadeth obtained from the manufacturer during that time period so I guess it's forgiveable. The music is intact and never sounded this great. For instance, with the verse riff to Hangar 18, you can now clearly hear the seperate note picking where the notes kinda meshed together on the 1990 version. That's how crisp it sounds now. As far as the bonus tracks are concerned, \\"My Creation\\" in my opinion could still be done without, but the demo's with Chris Poland on lead are worth purchasing this all over again just to hear him on these beloved tracks and hear the differences between him and Marty. Still a classic Metal MILESTONE no matter when it's remastered or re-released that should be owned by all true metal lovers around the globe! <br />
B0006212Q8|5.0|Terrific traveling music.  Bruce and Roy make a great duo!
B000021YQV|5.0|This is, by far and away, System of A Down's best album. I know this review will probably not be noticed, because there are over 900 others saying pretty much the same thing, but I figured I'd put my two cents in. <br />The juddering, false starting intro to \\"Prison Song\\" sets the mood for the whole album: sit down and hold on for dear life. Most songs on the disc, with the exceptions of Aerials, and to a lesser extent, Toxicity, are an assault on your eardrums. The tracks are incredibly melodic, though. The Armenian influence of the band's members results in a strange, foreign sounding scale which is used on most of the songs, giving the entire album an eerie sound. <br />Overall, highly recommended. No matter your tastes, at least give \\"Aerials\\" a go-round. The melody and eerie vocals of Serj Takanian will most likely leave you as this album left me: a System junkie.
B00005JOML|1.0|i was looking forward to this movie. after i saw it i couldnt believe how bad it was. apart from maybe 10 minutes of combined action scenes, it was veerrry slow and at times flat out confusing. jamie fox was good but thats about it. dont waste 10 bucks to see this in the theaters and if you really still want to see it, then i suggest renting it.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I am astonished, bemused, and somewhat appalled to read these so-called \\"reviews\\" of a special edition DVD that not a single one of the review writers has seen! I am probably the first \\"reviewer\\" to contribute who has actually seen every frame and every menu of this new \\"Complete Dossier\\" DVD edition. I sympathize more than ever with artists and filmmakers who's work is criticized weeks or months before it is completed, based on speculation, grudges or other disinformation. I think it should be Amazon's policy for books, CDs or DVDs that have not yet been released  to rename this section of the product web pages: \\"Idle Speculations\\" or \\"Maladroit Divinations.\\" Both versions of the film look better on this special edition DVD than ever due to increased bit rates and improved video masters. But the real story is the bonus extras which are numerous and in-depth on a great range of topics that will be of interest to filmmakers, musicians, Apocalypse Now nerds, even ordinary civilian film fans. The film soundtrack is studied in detail, as is the post production in general. And many myths about the film and the filmmaking are explored in a FAQ section. The DVD has 22 minutes of scenes that were deleted from the original cut that didn't make it into Redux for reasons that can be imagined by viewers who finally get to see them on this DVD. The greatest addition is Coppola's very informative audio commentaries (both versions) which are frank and heartfelt. There is room for discussion on Storaro's and Coppola's decision to transfer the film in the 2.0:1 aspect ratio (with subtle cropping of the sides) for home video, and this is addressed in the featurette called \\"Apocalypse Now FAQ,\\" but I can report that as a former cinema projectionist and post production professional, the issue here is more complex and less black and white than many of these \\"widescreen purists\\" would have you believe in their screeds.  <br /> <br />Kim Aubry <br />San Francisco
B000CBSHK2|2.0|I knew something was amiss after ripping this to mp3 realizing it sounded EVEN WORSE, sounding way more degraded than the quality loss you'd expect from cd to mp3 transfer. If the decision to release these songs with poor sound quality was DELIBERATE then she's doubly failed; there is no added \\"warmth\\" or \\"ambience\\". This is a tragedy, because Orton has talent but it doesn't come through as I'd hoped on this album. I yawned several times during playback, it just isn't very good. These cuts would work better as throwaway, \\"alternate takes\\" or \\"rarities\\" - but as a bona fide career release? What she should have done is dump this production set and handed it over to William Orbit, who not only would have made these tracks infinitely more listenable, but you would actually HEAR them with proper EQ and mastering.

B000002KGT|5.0|In my opinion Rumours from Fleetwood Mac is one of the biggest albums of the 70's. The 10 songs on this CD are outstanding. In my opinion this is one of the best CD's of all time. Stevie Nicks does a very good job on Dreams. I really didn't know what the words were until I looked at the liner notes of the song. She gives this song good vocal performance. You Make Loving Fun is my favorite song on this CD. Christine McVie does a wonderful job of singing this song. I love the beats of the songs Don't Stop and Go Your Own Way. The CD starts out with the song Second Hand News which is a very nice up-tempo song by the group. Never Going Back Again is the shortest song on the CD but a very good song. The Chain has very good harmony vocals on it also. The CD ends with Stevie Nicks singing Gold Dust Woman, A haunting theme to it. Fleetwood Mac went above and beyond when they recorded this album. Good Job!!!

1932100385|5.0|This book has changed my life.  I had read Mad Cowboy and Fast Food Nation and already thought that Dr. McDougall was headed in the right direction.  Ominvore's Dilemma had a big imact too.  But The China Study brings it all together with tons and tons of data that have been laboriously, meticulously gathered on diets and diseases- and over a long period of time.  These things together mean good statistics, not people manipulating numbers to play grand games of denial.  Eating dead animals and the stuff that comes out of the live ones (like eggs and dairy) is killing us.  After you read this sobering but hopeful book, you will know that what Dr. Campbell elucidates is far from conjecture.

B000679N96|5.0|There's something about the primitive innocence of early Cure that makes me want to listen to it again and again. As a dyed-n-the-wool Cure fan, I like or at least appreciate nearly everything they do, but this early stuff is really melodic and could potentially appeal to a much bigger crowd than, say, their PORNOGRAPHY album ever could. Sure, one could say the American release of THREE IMAGINARY BOYS (renamed BOYS DON'T CRY) is superior, but Disk 1 presents the album in its original form - that's history, baby! Yes, \\"Killing An Arab\\" belongs here, but that song's pretty easy to come by anyway so no biggie. \\"Plastic Passion\\" is also missing, but you can get that one on the JOIN THE DOTS B-side collection which is worth getting for the first disk alone (and, of course, there's always downloading..). Obviously, this expanded package is aimed at the die-hard fans, but some of the unreleased tracks on Disk 2 are actually superior to many of the TIB tracks (IMHO). There's a lot of really cool music on Disk 2 that's worth discovering even if you're not a big fan. In addition there's a few well-known singles and some demos that are mostly of interest to the diehards.<br /><br />The following is a song by song commentary of Disk 2 from an old-school Cure fan (since '85). I've never been dedicated or savvy enough to collect a lot of bootlegs, so for me most of Disk 2 was a thrilling discovery. Many of these early songs are in a straight-up punk style that they had already abandoned by the time they recorded their debut. ----------------------------------------------------><br /><br />\\"I Want To Be Old\\" (studio demo) - this appropriately cynical song totally rips. Very punk. Robert Smith has said his main influences starting out were The Sex Pistols, The Clash and the Buzzcocks, and that influence is very evident on several Disk 2 tracks including this one. Great sound. *****<br /><br />\\"I'm Cold\\" (studio demo) - many Cure fans are familiar with a slowed-down, wiggy version of this song which served as an early B-side. This is a straight-up version, upbeat and rocking. The lyrics are perfectly clear without the wicked reversed echo heard on the B-side and they're so cool - cold, actually. Guitar wizard Porl Thompson appears on several of these early tracks including this cut. After a falling out with Robert Smith, he later rejoined the band. Great sound on this one.  *****<br /><br />\\"Heroin Face\\" (live) - a harsh blast of punked-up energy. Fairly decent but certainly not great sound (I believe it's an audience recording). Those fortunate enough to have a copy of the rare CURIOSITY cassette released back in the day have heard this track. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"I Just Need Myself\\" (studio demo) - Robert Smith quite obviously cops Sex Pistol singer Johnny Rotten's vocal style on this cut (as he does on the TIB track \\"So What\\"). He even sounds a bit like a sneering Rotten but whinier. Pretty basic rock n' roll with Porl wailing on guitar. I love it. ****<br /><br />\\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" (home demo) - I am so thrilled to have this version. Just a young Robert Smith, home alone on Hammond organ, guitar and drum machine. This version captures the bare essence of the song. Robert sounds so anguished! *****<br /><br />\\"The Cocktail Party\\" (home demo) - an amusing lark with Hawaiian-sounding guitar, poorly recorded but fun. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Grinding Halt\\" (home demo) - early document, mostly of interest to those who study the band. Not much different from the final studio version, has bad sound. ***<br /><br />\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (studio demo) - pretty good, straight-up version. A very good pop song (but far from my personal Cure fav). ****<br /><br />\\"It's Not You\\" (studio demo) - cool song, very good version, some different lyrics. ****<br /><br />\\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" (studio demo) - great version, not too different but way cool. *****<br /><br />\\"Fire In Cairo\\" (studio demo) - cool version, slightly grittier sound on the guitars. *****<br /><br/>\\"Winter\\" (studio out-take) - this is a great lost track. So soft and dreamy, I can understand why it wasn't included on the debut. A harbinger of more mellow and emotional songs to come from the Cure. *****<br /><br />\\"Faded Smiles\\" aka \\"I Don't Know\\" (studio out-take) - another great lost track, this one rocks. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Play With Me\\" (studio out-take) - Wow! yet another great unreleased song, this one has a prickly old-school guitar groove that just works. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"World War\\" (rare album track) - Robert Smith hates this cut and was appalled when label head Chris Perry added it to the original album line-up. If memory serves, this song was on my old BOYS DON'T CRY tape and I've always found its primitive, almost bone-headed approach strangely appealing. It's got a sort of sinister post-apocalyptic feel to it. ****<br /><br />\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (extra album track) - the (should've been) hit single. Undeniably catchy..and truly great (but again, not my favorite Cure song). ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Jumping Someone Else's Train\\" (extra album track) - This frantic, runaway-train track is one of their best singles. A biting commentary on poseurs. *****<br /><br />\\"Subway Song\\" (live) - previously available on the CURIOSITY tape. An otherworldly sounding, very cool bootleg. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Accuracy\\" (live) - To my amazement, Smith has claimed this to be one of his favorite Cure songs (although it was back in the 80s when he mentioned this in some interview). I don't share his opinion. \\"Accuracy\\" is too \\"sing-songy\\" for my tastes. This early bootleg does nothing to change my opinion of it. **1/2<br /><br />\\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" (live) - a totally punked-out, hyper-kinetic blast through \\"10:15.\\" Quite a vast difference between this one and Robert's home demo, but both of them are absolutely fantastic in their own way. This live version gets into some totally groove-worthy rhythms near the end and reaches a head-spinning climax. A must for Cure fans! *****<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Just for the fun of it, I made my own \\"alternate reality Cure album\\" composed of the \\"new\\" songs on this disk along with some early B-sides from the JOIN THE DOTS collection. It's almost like the great lost Cure punk album, what they might have put out when these songs were recorded had they gotten the chance. As someone mentioned elsewhere, \\"See The Children\\" is another great early track that should've been included here. Robert Smith probably left it off because it's a song sung from the point of view of a child molester! LOL, I think he had enough headaches from the \\"Killing An Arab\\" debacle. But you can hear it on Utube.<br /><br />\\"SICKNESS\\"<br /><br />I Want To Be Old<br />I'm Cold<br />I Just Need Myself<br />Do The Hansa<br />The Coctail Party<br />Heroin Face<br />World War<br />Plastic Passion<br />Pillbox Tales<br />Faded Smiles<br />Winter<br />Play With Me/>\\"Winter\\" (studio out-take) - this is a great lost track. So soft and dreamy, I can understand why it wasn't included on the debut. A harbinger of more mellow and emotional songs to come from the Cure. *****<br /><br />\\"Faded Smiles\\" aka \\"I Don't Know\\" (studio out-take) - another great lost track, this one rocks. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Play With Me\\" (studio out-take) - Wow! yet another great unreleased song, this one has a prickly old-school guitar groove that just works. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"World War\\" (rare album track) - Robert Smith hates this cut and was appalled when label head Chris Perry added it to the original album line-up. If memory serves, this song was on my old BOYS DON'T CRY tape and I've always found its primitive, almost bone-headed approach strangely appealing. It's got a sort of sinister post-apocalyptic feel to it. ****<br /><br />\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" (extra album track) - the (should've been) hit single. Undeniably catchy..and truly great (but again, not my favorite Cure song). ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Jumping Someone Else's Train\\" (extra album track) - This frantic, runaway-train track is one of their best singles. A biting commentary on poseurs. *****<br /><br />\\"Subway Song\\" (live) - previously available on the CURIOSITY tape. An otherworldly sounding, very cool bootleg. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Accuracy\\" (live) - To my amazement, Smith has claimed this to be one of his favorite Cure songs (although it was back in the 80s when he mentioned this in some interview). I don't share his opinion. \\"Accuracy\\" is too \\"sing-songy\\" for my tastes. This early bootleg does nothing to change my opinion of it. **1/2<br /><br />\\"10:15 Saturday Night\\" (live) - a totally punked-out, hyper-kinetic blast through \\"10:15.\\" Quite a vast difference between this one and Robert's home demo, but both of them are absolutely fantastic in their own way. This live version gets into some totally groove-worthy rhythms near the end and reaches a head-spinning climax. A must for Cure fans! *****<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Just for the fun of it, I made my own \\"alternate reality Cure album\\" composed of the \\"new\\" songs on this disk along with some early B-sides from the JOIN THE DOTS collection. It's almost like the great lost Cure punk album, what they might have put out when these songs were recorded had they gotten the chance. As someone mentioned elsewhere, \\"See The Children\\" is another great early track that should've been included here. Robert Smith probably left it off because it's a song sung from the point of view of a child molester! LOL, I think he had enough headaches from the \\"Killing An Arab\\" debacle. But you can hear it on Utube.<br /><br />\\"SICKNESS\\"<br /><br />I Want To Be Old<br />I'm Cold<br />I Just Need Myself<br />Do The Hansa<br />The Coctail Party<br />Heroin Face<br />World War<br />Plastic Passion<br />Pillbox Tales<br />Faded Smiles<br />Winter<br />Play With Me

B00000I2UE|2.0|The Jesus and Mary Chain - Darklands (1987)<br /><br />This music isn't very exciting and it's not nearly as dark as some would have you believe or what the title implies. This album has little in common with the surf tunes and buzzsaw distortion of their acclaimed debut PSYCHOCANDY. The song \\"Darklands\\" sounds too much like Bowie's \\"Heroes\\" (if you know what I mean - the melody is a little too similar) and I get the feeling that's not the only thing ripped-off on this album. Not that it really matters much anyway because there's plenty of songs I do like that rips off other peoples' music.<br /><br />I'm sure many would slag my opinion, but it just comes down to a question of taste - and this album tastes pretty bland to me. However, it's certainly NOT true that all of J&MC's albums sound the same and there's 2 very different sounding ones that I would recommend far more than DARKLANDS: the dancable shredfest HONEY'S DEAD and the laid-back, supercool and mostly acoustic STONED AND DETHRONED.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|Before I really get started, I need to give a warning to the casual movie fan: WATCH THE TV SERIES \\"FIREFLY\\" FIRST!  I only say this because the first time I watched Serenity, my girlfriend and I had absolutely no clue what was going on, and we didn't much like the movie.  Well, I enjoyed it alright, but it took me 3/4 of the film just to understand what was up and which characters to take seriously, etc...  I did, however, purchase the \\"Firefly\\" DVDs when Amazon had them on sale, and I have since seen every episode and re-watched Serenity.  After having seen the TV show, I LOVE the movie. <br /> <br />Having said all of that, Serenity is fabulous!  It really is a shame that Fox has cancelled another great series because this really is a great world Joss Whedon has created, and with his talent, the show was only to get better.  (Note: I'm also a huge fan of Whedon's work in comics.  He deserves props for his work on Astonishing X-Men which earned him an Eisner award this year, which is proof of his excellent story telling.)
B000FMGTTE|5.0|Well done of John Ottman, who found a good balance between using the majestic greatness of the John Williams music and his own new themes and ideas. <br />About the CD: because he is enhanced and therefor contains 4 mov-files, there was not enough space left on the CD for the music.  For example: I miss the music played when Superman gets out of the plane he just rescued and is being welcomed back and cheered by the people around.   <br />In fact, when a customer buys a MUSIC-CD, he expects AUDIO and not VIDEO. Allthough the \\"Behind the scenes: Superman Returns Score\\" is very very good, (almost got a heart-attack seeing and hearing it for the first time) it should be on the DVD (on which there is a lot more space) who is yet to come soon, and not on this CD. <br />Finally, the \\"Look up in the Sky\\" is in fact free publicity for an other feature we can buy. And the two trailers are legaly available on the internet. <br />So because of al this extra video-material, there is not enough space on the CD for the soundtrack. <br />Nowing the marchandise, we may soon be expecting a double-CD with the whole soundtrack, so as they did with \\"Moulin Rouge\\". <br />*GSX july 2006*

B000067UUJ|5.0|Into the new millennium and Muse together with Gomez, Mercury Rev, Elbow, Coldplay and The Flaming Lips (from \\"Soft Bulletin\\" (1999) onwards) were the bands that really excited me the most. (Previous to these recent years Kings X and Dream Theater \\"did it for me\\" in the 90's, Marillion were \\"my 80's\\" band together with Simple Minds, Big Country, Waterboys and U2. My 70's favorites were largely Genesis, Rush and Jethro Tull.    This live album from 2001 is, for me, an absolutely stunning performance from a band who are prepared to push the boundaries of Rock. The first album I bought from Muse was 2001's \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" after reading a review and listening to a couple of tracks. I was hooked. Muse do wear their influences on their sleeve (a large heping of Queen, a fair bit of Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin) as they produce a sound that is uniquely their own. Lead singer Mike Bellamy has a great voice with tremendous range and the combination of this superb drumming, bass, guitar and keyboard work in a live setting is simply awesome.     So many highlights, the one for me that sums up Muse best, especially in the live context, is \\"Citizen Erased\\" - FANTASTIC! This is one of six tracks from \\"Origin of Symmetry\\". Two tracks from 1998's effort \\"Showbiz\\" plus three new tracks make up the set.    (Also check out the DVD - well worth it, fantasic sound, a real rocking show which features 8 more tracks than the CD (four more from \\"Showbiz\\" and \\" Origin\\").    The bonus \\"B Sides\\" disc is a great addition with some excellent tracks (6 of the 10 tracks I really enjoyed which is great for an extra disc of B sides).    All 'n' all - There are a handful of \\"new\\" bands who I enjoy listening to and Muse is way up there and this Live album is stunning.     Certainly one of the great live albums of the new millennium from one of the great bands of these modern times, a tremendous experience in today's age - real musicians playing real instruments and playing with energy and passionin front of a very appreciative audience at the \\"Zenith\\" in Paris.    Certainly one of my favourite live albums over the last 35 years, here are some of my other favourites)...   - \\"How the West was won\\" from Led Zeppelin (1972)   - \\"Made in Japan\\" from Deep Purple (1972)   - \\"Yessongs\\" from Yes (1973)   - \\"Welcome back my friends\\" from ELP (1973)   - \\"Too late to stop now\\" from Van Morrison (1974)   - \\"On your feet or on your knees\\" from Blue Oyster Cult (1975)   - \\"Live in London\\" from Bruce Springsteen (1975)   - \\"One more from the Road\\" from Lynyrd Skynrd (1976)   - \\"Frampton comes alive\\" from Peter Frampton (1976)   - \\"Live Bullet\\" from Bob Seger (1976)   - \\"Seconds Out\\" from Genesis (1977)   - \\"A Live Record\\" from Camel (1978)   - \\"Bursting Out Live\\" from Jethro Tull (1978)   - \\"Two for the Show\\" from Kansas (1978)   - \\"Playing the fool\\" Gentle Giant (1978)   - \\"Waiting fro Columbus\\" from Little Feat (1978)   - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" from UFO (1979)   - \\"Live Rust\\" from Neil Young (1979).   - \\"Paris\\" from Supertramp (1980).   - \\"Exit...Stage left\\" from Rush (1981)   - \\"Under a blood red sky\\" from U2 (1983)   - \\"Stop making sense\\" from Talking Heads (1984)   - \\"Live in the city of Light\\" from Simple Minds (1986)   - \\"Live adventures of the Waterboys\\" from the Waterboys (1986)   - \\"Operation Livecrime\\" from Queensryche (1991)   - \\"Without a safety Net\\" from Big Country (1992)   - \\"Secret World Live\\" from Peter Gabriel (1994)   - \\"Together in Concert\\" from Tim Finn, Dave Dobbyn, Bic Runga (2000)   - \\"Live Scenes from New York\\" from Dream Theater (2000)   - \\"Hullabaloo\\" from Muse (2002)   - \\"Out West\\" from Gomez (2005)   - \\"Instant Delivery\\" from Flower Kings (2006).   - \\"Okonokos\\" from My Morning Jacket (2006)       I really enjoy this album, if you do get it I hope you do to.

B000059Z8J|4.0|What can you say? This was and still is a great movie. The story line is fluid, the acting is great and the special effects were tops for the day and still stand the test of time today. I remember first seeing this movie in elementary school and watching it now takes me back to a simpler time when going to the movies was a special treat. The magic I remember from then still comes streaming back today.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|RHCP latest album, is supposed to be their best ever. However, as this live show DVD can prove, they have always had the talent. The disc contains many of their greatest hits and a great performance at Slane Castle. As a RHCP fan for many many years--since they started.. I definitely recomend this DVD. It is a must have for any devoted fan.
B000EGCITG|5.0|I could say something good about every track on the US version.  Good variety of lyrics, music, and laced with wit.  This is an album by an adult, for adults.  I wouldn't let my two pre-teens listen to this one, but I love it.  Now that I know the UK version has two more tracks, I want them... <br /> <br />Pink's voice and writing skills should power her career for as long as she cares to share them with us.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I still can't believe this series was canceled. Writing, acting, direction, filming--all great. The whole concept was incredible. I wish they'd bring it back (on a different network of course,) but until they do, I can watch this season over and over without getting sick of it.
B00000K31V|5.0|i didn't know what to think of this movie at first but after about the thirty minute mark i couldn't stop watching. its got plenty of plot twist and was really a good movie to watch curled up on the couch when you have nothing to do.
B000AP2ZDK|5.0|When coming into land at LAX (Los Angeles International Airport), the big donut sign from Randy's Donuts (featured in the album artwork and somewhat in the title) is a familiar sight just off the starboard jet engine and it also represents the big brass ring everyone's looking to grab when they get to LA.  Jay Dee reached out and grabbed it.  The ubiquitous sound of sirens throughout the album represent to me the ubiquitous sounds of certain communities where ambulance, fire, and police presence is undeniably greater.  It is also a love letter to his community.   Great album, great artist, his early demise is a massive loss for music. Only the good die young!    R.I.P James Yancey aka Jay Dee/J Dilla
B0006213WG|4.0|This is a good, decent record.  It's not their best, but it is a good decent record.  It seems that Sum 41 is attempting a sort of evolution toward a more serious rock band.  Given their brief history, it's an interesting choice.  I can't decide if they have decided to embrace their punk roots or shed them with this record.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Welcome To Hell\\" and \\"No Reason\\" will remind you of \\"All Killer No Filler,\\" while it seems out of the blue, come \\"Pieces,\\" \\"Some Say\\" and \\"There's No Solution\\" that almost sound like they could have come from a different band.  These tracks are more mellow and melodic.  These are more pop songs.  They are good; I enjoy them, but they are unexpected.<br /><br />That's not all.  You also have \\"The Bitter End\\" and \\"88\\" that sound more metal.<br /><br />So, Sum 41's problem in marketing this is just this:  Who are they?  What are they about?  Are they about easy to listen to radio melodies, hard rock or punk?  I also think that they rushed their \\"growing up\\" a little.  I still think that deep down, they'd rather be about the fun that was \\"All Killer.\\"<br /><br />All that being said, I really enjoy most of the tracks on this CD.  It's not a slam dunk by any means, but unless you are a loyalist to the punk movement, you will likely be very entertained by what SUM 41 produced here.  Enjoy!
044651652X|1.0|I thought this was one of the worst books I ever attempted to read.  The whole plot is just plain ridiculous.  Bored middle-aged housewife meets drifting artist and in the space of four days they fall madly in love with a passion that lasts a lifetime.  When the kiddies find out they think it is noble that mom cheated on dad and pined away all those years.  Such rubbish--don't people see how contrived and unrealistic, not to mention immoral, this is?  Avoid this one.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Bob's first album was a great album of covers of folk classics with very little original material. Freewheelin' is his first album of primarily his own songs (his 2nd album overall). Many of the songs are extremely well-known classics, and those that are not, are equally great. Bob's conscience and wit are both in full force on this album, which indisputably ranks among the greatest folk albums, nay albums ever recorded. The instrumental set-up is very stripped-down, in fact I believe it's just Bob playing guitar and harmonica and of course singing; I am yet to notice a single overdub. Sure Dylan's voice isn't what most call pretty or \\"good,\\" but it ideally suits his songs and style. As a guitar player, though he's not some high-flyin' virtuouso, Bob Dylan is extremely underrated; I'd be as bold as to call him one of folk music's finest pickers! One listening to this album will feel a broad range of emotions and will have much to think about, because Bob's lyrics, as most know, are one of a kind and among the best, if not the best, ever penned. If you don't yet own this album, you are missing out and should purchase it as soon as possible.
B0002S947K|5.0|When I first heard \\"Forever My Friend\\" and \\"Trouble\\" on NY's the Peak on the radio, I was reminded of the melodies and string accompaniments of Van Morrison. But Ray's voice offers something a bit more humble. It's a raspy swamp yankee kind of a sound. I read that he is from Vermont and was inspired to write and sing after hearing Stephen Stills.<br /><br />I purchased the album and casually listened to it around the house and in the car. But the quality and care of his work forced to me to hear it from beginning to end without interruptions. Some of his slower songs like \\"Shelter\\" sent chills through me. It has this Appalacian rustic feel to it. And there are hints of Otis Redding and Neil Young as well.<br /><br />This album is timeless and flawless. It's one of those rare collections that truly expresses the deep passion by the song-writer. Ray is just as awesome in concert. I saw him NYC last fall at Town Hall. He was bit shy, but again, there's a humility in him that's respectable.<br /><br />So if you're into Otis Redding, Van Morrison, Eliott Smith, and Neil Young - a blend of acoustic rock, R & B, blues, folk - you will not be disappointed in this album. I can't wait for the next one.
B000AP04EW|3.0|I thought Mr. and Mrs. Smith, directed by Doug Liman, was a fun, entertaining flick. The premise of the movie is this: John and Jane Smith, after five (or six) years of rather lackluster marriage, visit a marriage counselor for a \\"tune-up.\\" During their session, they admit to keeping \\"little secrets\\" from one another. We later learn that they are both assassins for hire, maintaining a secret life apart from one another. Their professional worlds collide, however, when they are both assigned to the same hit.<br /><br />In the ensuing scenes, the couple realizes the duplicity of their marriage as both are assigned to kill each other. A few rollicking shoot outs later, the two decide that perhaps their union is worth saving after all, and they decide to flaunt their employers and fight for one another. (I realize that this plot is not exactly brain surgery. However, how many moody, wordy, deep dramas can one watch? Sometimes a little mindless entertainment is exactly what is needed.)<br /><br />Aside from the physical perfection of both Angelina Jolie (Jane Smith) and Brad Pitt (John Smith), their on-screen chemistry is great. In addition to great physical work in this movie, they both flex their comedic muscles to great effect. (I loved lines like, \\"You still alive down there, baby?\\" What a hoot!) And while the story line follows a very familiar path, it is still fully enjoyable.<br /><br />While violent, the carnage in this movie is not particularly graphic; it lives up to its PG13 rating. As no heavy mental lifting is required, it's great, indulgent entertainment. I would recommend this film for both couples and families with older children.
B000FUTQ8C|2.0|I could not have been more excited when I heard that an hier would be writing a prequel to the Dune books telling the story of the Bulterian Jihad.  I purposefully stayed away from the three Great House books, because I thought that they would not live up to the majesty of F. Herbert's creation.  I also dared to dream that B. Herbert and Anderson had worked out the kinks, and were ready to settle down and give us some good Dune canon.  How wrong I was.   <br /> <br />That is not to say that the three books were terrible and unreadable.  From a plot standpoint the Bulterian Jihad was pretty good.  The next two were not as good, but were readable.  I think my biggest problem with the books, including this one, was that as time went on they read more and more like the results of a contractual obligation to produce at the bare minimum, some words on paper.  The books lacked any attempt to tell the story from a social perspective, and instead relied on the individual perceptions characters which were not all that well developed.  In my opinion, this is why these books do not fit well with the F. Herbert books.  They are just space opera fodder with a rather bland description of what happens, with no comment on why, or what the ramifications are.  If the books had at least had that, then I would have been happy to include them on the shelf with the good ones, despite the fact that the authors failed in all the ways these various reviews mention.   <br /> <br />I will give them one more chance with Book 7, Hunters of Dune.  But if it is as bad as these, I will re-write it for them for free!
B000002GQK|5.0|Released in 1971, this is yet another outstanding album by the Moody Blues that finds them flirting with slightly more experimental themes than found on previous albums.  Although, when I actually think about it, the only experimental moments on this album include the track Procession, which consists of a sound collage of moog synthesizer and vocal parts that gradually leads into an excellent (albeit brief) pipe organ solo, and culminates in a glorious crescendo of mellotron.  In addition, Mike Pinder's mellotron-heavy track My Song is also somewhat experimental, and features very inventive arrangements.  In fact, the track might be said to be bordering somewhat on prog rock, although more in the Spring/Barclay James Harvest sense of the word rather than Yes.<br /><br />Even though I am a huge prog fan and like the experimental passages quite a lot, it is the less experimental tracks such as The Story in your Eyes, Our Guessing Game, Emily's Song, One more Time to Live, and You can Never Go Home that remind me why I love this band so much.  Specifically, it is the dreamy and reflective moments of their music that I find so appealing, not to mention the innocence of all of their music and the cosmic, searching lyrics.<br /><br />Overall, this really is a superb album that features an excellent blend of gloomy, mellotron heavy pieces along with the cheery and upbeat track Nice to be Here.  Although I personally find the mood of this album to be somewhat more pensive and maybe a little darker, it is no less enjoyable than any of the \\"Big 7\\".<br /><br />Every Good Boy Deserves Favour is very highly recommended along with Days of Future Passed (1967); In Search of the Lost Chord (1968); To Our Children's, Children's, Children (1969); and A Question of Balance (1970).
B00006BTCA|5.0|Interpol's \\"Turn On the Bright Lights\\" has received over 400 customer reviews. Some customers hate the material on the CD; some like it; some love it! If you hate it, you hate it. If you like it, you like it. If you love it, you love it. Interpol plays the kind of music they want to play. They write the lyrics they want to write. They are appealing to whom they wish to be appealing. You need only to ask yourself one question: \\"Does 'Turn On the Bright Lights' appeal to me?\\" Answer this, and you will know whether or not to buy the CD.
B00004Y6NW|1.0|I've thought last night that this is one of the Dire Straits worst albums in my music guide. Some of the worst songs I have ever heard from this great band seem to appear in Water Of Love, In The Gallery, and Wild West End. I mean the vocals are crappy, so as the music. The only good song is Sultans Of Swing. This is a bit overrated Dire Straits along with Making Movies, Communique, and Alchemy. The 3 that I recommend such as Brothers in Arms, Love Over Gold, and On Every Street are actully listenable. Go buy those 3 insted!!! Don't listen to the 5 star reviewers too. SUCKS!!!!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|As if Toxicity wasnt mediocre enough, this just takes everything that was once good and dumps all over it. Where do we place the blame? Is it Darons poor songwriting skills? Or maybe its the dropping of the once thrash-driven riffs and drums in favor of a more accessible MTV-whitewashed corporate music that everyone and their parents would eat up? Or maybe theirs just no more soul left in a once killer band that was a breath of fresh era from all that nu-metal garbage that invaded the radio and TV?<br /><br />Whichever one you choose, this is not the SOAD we all love, this is an unoriginal rehash of Toxicity. Oh wow, they have an anti-government song? So what, who hasnt made one of those. And anti-war songs? Travel back to the 60s, they were chock full full of them. Everything I hear is uninspired and downright lazy. Its also unfortunate that Serj got sidelined by Daron \\"I wish I had talent\\" Malakian, for he literally tries too hard to make interesting songs, while coming out in the end as those annoying kids that have ADHD in your classroom that are just seriously not funny.<br /><br />Maybe im being to harsh, but you would be annoyed too if a once great band betrayed their pre-Toxicity fanbase in order to get more money and exposure, and in turn seem hypocritical to their lyrics.<br /><br />You want to get good music, get SOAD's self titled, its their best and the only one that wasnt corrupted by the capitalist pigs known as MTV.
B000002H2H|1.0|I would like to edit my review because this has 2 good songs in For Whom The Bell Tolls, and Fade to Black. I'm not a huge Metallica fan. I just like about 3 of their good albums in Black Album, Master of Puppets, and this Ride the Lightning.
B000003TA4|1.0|I have some words for you who like this album that belongs in the dump. Kurt Cobain is not a legend only a guy who could not deal with fame so he killed himself. This band should not be put on level of good bands such as the Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin. BTW Smells like Teen Spirit is a crappy song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B000002H33|2.0|I'll say yes, because this atleast has about 2 good songs in Battery and Orion. Listen to those. Battery makes me laugh.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|The amazon reviewer has it just about right, but that's because he/she says its real good but they expected better.  Uh, reviewers... <br /> <br />This is clearly Mark's CD with the songs sung as duets with such a class act as Emmylou Harris.  If he sang these songs solo, we would yawn a bit and say it was an interesting work. With Emmylou it is engaging and beautifully sung as one would expect given her incredible talent.  Her two contributions are the real country entries, but Mark brings them back to center.   <br /> <br />Sure the CD doesn't take many chances, but it is a classic CD with two class acts who don't need to take chances past Emmylou singing Dire Straits tunes and Mark singing country. Isn't that enough?  uh, reviewers!  Just buy the CD at this incredibly low price and you will get much more than your money's worth. <br />
B000002H97|4.0|The original Metallica black album came out when I was born.<br /><br />It is one of my favorite albums of all time. Some of my favorite songs appear on Enter Sandman, Unforgiven, and Wherever I May Roam. As on my birthday, I will play this album. My birthday is August 13.
B000301YY8|5.0|Listening to Beautiful, you will notice a distict difference between this CD and the radio version which is sold by Amazon as the \\"clean\\" version.  As long as you are not buying this underage or for someone underage or sensitive to language, the explicit lyric version is far more powerful and sympathetic to what he is trying to say in these well written songs. <br /> <br />He has a distinctive voice and that on another level, at this time in our world's history, we need this work and others like it to make sense of the chaos around us. <br /> <br />This is an excellent collection very well produced. And a great price!  Grab it, its a clear winner.
B000003TA4|5.0|Hey, don't read the idiot below me...... <br /> <br />Led Zeppelin has to be one of the worst bands of all time. Nirvana were one of my favorite bands of all time. They made legends in Smells Like teen spirit, come as you are, and in bloom. Nirvana are definately better than The beatles or Led zeppelin SO BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY WITH METALLICA.
B000001ESF|5.0|I look back upon my discovery of this album, while still a teen in high school, and find it marks the point when I became a metal head.  Now, at 44 years of age, I'm even more of a metal head.<br /><br />2112 comes blasting through your speakers with the opening epic and thumps your heart with excellent prog-metal, and most certainly does not leave your brain behind with the thought provoking lyrics.<br /><br />Reader, you must keep in mind, in the mid seventies when this album first hit the street, it was ground breaking.  There was nothing to compare it to.  It was heavy, unique, and well-crafted.  It still is 30 years later.<br /><br />Try this disc.  If you like prog-rock, you'll be amazed at what happened 30 years ago.  I'm still a Rush fan, and attended their 30th anniversary tour in 2004, and all these years later I still can't recommend this recording enough.
B00004Y6NX|2.0|Making Movies was a pretty overrated album just like the debut. <br />What I think is that the 2nd song on the album, ROMEO AND JULIET, <br />uhh, this song is a bit overrated. It is not a song about love either. I think Foreigner's Waiting for a Girl Like You is more lovely than Romeo and Juliet because of the lyrics and nice vocals. I think Love Over Gold is better because of the heavier power. I can think of 2 maybe 3 good songs on Making Movies but the rest of the songs are crappy. Even a Guns N' Roses and Metallica CD/LP is better than this! Ignore this and the debut and get Love Over Gold insted.

B000089RVX|5.0|hi, my name is not important as i am in the legion of extreme evanescence fans. i just turned fifteen and with my mom and stepdad telling me who i should be and how i should feel all of the time, i havent really had a chance to find myself yet. i mean, how could they know all of the pressures that i have to endure day after day what with summer school and a morning job hauling away yesterdays pastry items for the stupid bakery in the plaza. growing up in laguna beach california with a name like piper is hard enough. everybody from every side is telling me how i can navigate life easily, but i think that they forget who i am. i dress in black and i like to experement with other boys who live on these tough streets as well. i mean, its 2006, why do i have to hide my sexuality like its a closely guarded secret? any way, enough about me. this band is so awesome because they are older, and they have gone through exactly what i am going through/will go through. im sorry mom, but id rather listen to adults that sell a coulple million records that you. i mean, these guys (and girl) have their fingers on the pulse of the every day teen. how could they not be taken seriously? bands like them and staind are the reason that kids like myself still have hope. and linkin park too!!!! and if josh reads this, and i know he will, i saw her making out with toby. she doesnt like you. why dont you come over to the team who has your best interests in mind? <br /> <br />kisses.
0060934913|5.0|Its always nice to pick up a book, and become so involved that you just cant put it down. Anthony writes in such a way that the reader is able to picture everything that is happening. And better than that, I find myself wanting to be there for every misadventure.  <br /> <br />Anyone who loves to cook, eat, or has worked in the food service business will surely enjoy this read. Be prepared for Tonys blunt brand of truth. Thankfully, its something that, once you have read more than one of his books, you come to enjoy, applaud... and even count on.  <br /> <br />You might as well buy any of his other books now, if you havent read them, because you will want to.

A solid plot and many intricate details that revert back to the original few make H20 a must.  Even LL Cool J is good for his role.  Busta Rhymes however in Resurection...was not.

Plenty of repetition, unrealistic scenarios, and yet another fine look at family dysfunction.  <br /> <br />I read it through to be fair, and these were some painful pages to turn. The premise is unusual, and while it was most likely a challenge to write, it doesnt deserve all the fanfare. By the end I was only tired and disappointed.
B000002KDO|5.0|Yes, their first, self-titled album introduced the world to Sabbath's dark themes. And yes, \\"Paranoid\\" gave them even more depth by diplaying more of a political voice. But \\"Master of Reality\\" was somewhat of a synopsis of them both. Lyrics will never again be as vivid, nor animated. Doom, destruction, isolation, pollution... an album that screams about the common fears in the early 70s. This album was the basis for heavy metal's origins. Outrage, rebellion, anger and to some extent, fear. And like any great horror movie, Sabbath wraps those themes in music that is telltale of the albums contents. Every band member shows great strength throughout the album. Geezer Butler is a clinic with trademark basslines in every song, particulary worth noting during Iommi's solo in \\"Sweet Leaf\\". Iommi demonstrates what a classic metal guitar riff should be from start to finish. And Ozzy has never sounded more sinister. Metal was meant to be about the themes found in \\"Master of Reality\\". It's a shame that so many Sabbath influenced bands in the 80s didn't have such a background to grow into. They could only sit at a drawing board to come up with the very themes that lay before Sabbath's eye, ripe for the taking. Only Iron Maiden would come close, and only for a short, short spell. But if one wants to know how metal's evolved and wants to learn the most successful recipe in the genre's history, then \\"Master of Reality\\" is a must. Laced with so many crunching, powerful guitar riffs, ala \\"After Forever\\" (my favorite Sabbath tune), \\"Into the Void\\", and \\"Children of the Grave\\" and head turning lyrics (especially for their time) like \\"would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope, do you think he's a fool?\\" from \\"After Forever\\" and Sweet Leaf's \\"you introduced me to my mind, and left me wanting you and your kind\\" in reference to one man's experience with marijuana. One has to believe that Nixon had the feds following these fellas around when touring the USA. If he considered Mc Govern a threat to the country, what do you think the privacy invading Nixon felt about the likes of theses Brits? \\"Master of Reality\\" is what rock and roll was meant to be. Raw, controversial, crude but with direction, and alarming to the adults at the time. I can still see the faces on many a parent when hearing the opening of \\"Sweet Leaf\\". A little knowledge about the early 70s might help one understand the album a little better, though it's not necessary to appreciate the richness of the this band's musical onslaught. But it took such an era to launch a band with the voice and anger of Black Sabbath. Future metal bands will show the Sabbath ifluence, with better production providing more polished sounds. But a lack of similar environment will be missing, depriving them of the most necessary ingredient to harbor such authentic pain.
B00005JOQS|1.0|Over the years, gosh since maybe around the time of the first Matrix movie, magazines have been abuzz with how Hollywood is trying to script a new Superman. Screenplays where rejected and revised more than you or I have had hot dinners. Nicolas Cage was touted to play the man in red underwear. Then everything went flat. Spiderman came out and ruled. So naturally we waited for Hollywood to pump out the one that started it all. Summer 2006, Superman is here, and starts with an introduction where we get the same title effects of the 70s version with some CGI planets thrown in. All is looking good until Kevin Spacey stands around for minutes on end, looking old & bald, and saying \\"Wait for it\\" while nothing much impressive happens. The Marlin Brando scenes we all heard about do not exist except for a brief 5 second screen image that is superimposed on a crystal... and that is it. Superman returns from his debacle across the cosmos because he heard his planet had been spotted. Lois Lane has a kid. Kent goes to work in the Daily Planet. There is a power cut and Superman saves a plane from crashing, the best special effect in the movie is 20 min into the film! Between the twiddling-of-your-fingers, Kevin Spacey saying \\"Wait\\", and Superman sulking about Lois having a kid, you want something to happen and it does... Superman flies with Lois around the world to violin music. At the point you know something has gone terribly wrong and you know the direction that Singer is taking you. You will not be wasting your time getting up and going to watch X3 instead in the other screen. Secretly I just wanted Superman to let Lois fall. Heck, anything to just keep us awake. After the violin-playing flying around, Lois meets Lex Luther and he tells her that is going to take over the world by creating a super sized country in the ocean. There is then a terrible plot twist involving children that will make you balk, scenes with a plane flying around and a shipwreck just to have Superman pull people out of a sinking vessel (what was that all about???) and then a Superman Lex fight sequence involving kryptonite that begs to ask why Superman didn't detect something sooner. And it is not as if the Superman Returns makers thought much out either... this is a thorough no-brainer with many \\"what\\" questions asked, between Spacey's \\"wait\\" from start to finish. Even fans of Superman I, II and III will be scratching their heads. Not since Ang Lee's The Hulk has there been such a mess of the Superhero franchise. Thank God for Sam Raimi and Spiderman. Even Batman Begins got the emotional balance right. Sadly Singer's Superman Returns is a terrible, terrible, terrible untidiness, a wasted Kevin Spacey and asks us to just eat up whatever is slapped onto the canvas. And 3 hours of it. Give me a break. I want Superman, not Supersulk! This isn't what we waited 20-30 years for! I feel like Kathy Bates in Mysery and want to stand up and shout at the screen! Very Sadly, instead of preventing the trainwreck, Superman just became one.ll people out of a sinking vessel (what was that all about???) and then a Superman Lex fight sequence involving kryptonite that begs to ask why Superman didn't detect something sooner.

B000002J27|5.0|After losing Gabriel, and after a massive search for a new front man, Genesis ended hundreds of auditions back where they started - with drummer Phil Collins. How else do you maintain the british rooted sounds that are in every Genesis lp to date. Few bands could withstand such a transition, and Genesis surely lost many a long time fan with Gabriel's departure. But once you get past that fact, \\"Trick of the Tail is a treasure to the ears. It is Genesis probably at their last creative heighth - powerful musical solos, distinct Collins drumming, crunching bass, tour de force Tony Banks keyboards and that detail given to every epic musical journey on most pre-\\"Abacab\\" CDs. It's also one of the last CDs that includes the distinct sounding Steve Hackett guitar flavoring that long time Genesis fans have grown accustomed to. The CD includes several of my favorite Genesis songs: \\"Ripples, Entangled\\" and \\"Squonk,\\" as well as concert staples and show stoppers like \\"Dance on a Volcano\\" and \\"Los Endos,\\" keyboard and drum masterpieces. I understand the mixed reaction that many listeners have to \\"Robbery, Assault and Battery\\"- initially I found it to be a bit too quirky for my liking. But I grew to appreciate it immensely as tiime moved on, and certainly after seeing it performed live. The following \\"Wind and Weathering\\" CD will be equal to the task, still maintaining long, non-radio airplay length type Genesis tunes without the Gabriel crutch to lean on. But \\"Trick of the Tail\\" was more monumental in it's proof that the show can go on after losing a intricate piece of the puzzle. Don't let the Gabriel loyalists discourage you from giving this one a test drive. This is probably the best produced, best sounding Genesis CD to date. For best results, slap on the headphones, and crank it up.
B000GB775E|3.0|I thought this movie was really cute. It is definitely a chick flick and is very entertaining. If that is what you are looking for, entertainment, then I would recommend this movie, but if you are looking to watch something meaningful then \\"Just My Luck\\" probably is not your best bet. I would definitely recommend this to any McFly fans. They have more than just a camio role in the film so it is worth seeing if you like them. <br /> <br />~Jenna
B000002I8D|5.0|To those unfamiliar with Collins-Genesis history, this album was recorded after Collins took a break from Genesis to dwell on his recent divorce. That is reflected painfully throughout this album in the lyrics to his own songs, and the covers he chose to include, such as the Beatles \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". In no future albums would Collins recapture the soul put into this album, though \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\" might be a slghtly better, more polished album. Painful ballads like the jazzy, smoky  \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\" are balanced by R&B selections like \\"Missed Again, Thunder and Lightning\\" the pulsating, toe tapping \\"Hand in Hand,\\" (appreciated best when played full blast or with head phones), or the jazzier version of the Genesis tune \\"Behind the Lines\\". Yet the best selections are indeed the ones that let him bleed from his divorce. \\"You Know What I Mean (the ballad lead-in to)/Thunder and Lightning\\" seems the theme to Collins' failed marriage. \\"This Must Be Love\\" poses those questions we ask ourselves about our relationships. Of course, we all know about the tune \\"In the Air Tonight\\". This album had a 2-fold effect - the introduction of Collins as a genuine soloist, and the rise, or fall (depending on how you look at it) of Genesis. Future Genesis albums would pack more radio play wallup due to Collin's take over in direction, but at the cost of departing from their progressive roots for the sake of commercial success. There have always been 2 such camps in Genesis following, though their earlier fans are more passionate obout that era than the newer fans are about their newer music. Anyone looking for a Genesis type album, look elsewhere. This album was to get the  Collins musical side out of his system, to express himself without any Genesis conflicts. Regardless, anyone who's ever had their heart broken or just likes to indulge into some brooding, Face Value is a sumptuous listen.
B00006AVRK|5.0|Be warned: this is one of those semi-\\"literary\\" reviews in which I'm going to talk about Wodehouse, the Jeeves and Wooster series, and the literary heirs of Wodehouse, for those who think there's no such thing as enough comedy in the world. <br /> <br />P. G. Wodehouse (\\"Plum\\" to his friends) was the funniest man who ever set pen to paper. He lived to the ripe old age of ninety-three and wrote over ninety books, many featuring the amiable and well-meaning, if somewhat misguided, Bertie Wooster and his brainy manservant Jeeves. Although his work stretches from the late 1890s to the early 1970s, the rudeness of the outside world almost never intrudes and there are surprisingly few cultural references. Wodehouse's stories exist in a kind of eternal Eden of innocent lads and maids chasing each other around the garden and trying to avoid the various serpents trying to crash the party. His characters are almost exclusively from that most useless branch of society, the English moneyed class, and their problems are all silly ones: which witless man will win which brainless girl, and how Aunt Dahlia can steal a silver cow-creamer for her husband so that he'll give her the necessary funds to buoy up her ladies' journal \\"Milady's Boudoir.\\" <br /> <br />And yet. . . And it's in the \\"and yet\\" that Wodehouse makes his mark as the most brilliant social satirist of all time. Unlike George Bernard Shaw, Wodehouse makes no grand stands, addresses no revolutionary agendas. Simply, quietly, and persistently, he takes aim at pretension, meanness, and cruelty by carrying it to its most absurd extent.  <br /> <br />Wodehouse's humor is small, domestic, personal, and eternal. Of a man engaged to a bossy woman, he writes: \\"He might take the view that when the little [woman] made him sit up and beg and snap lumps of sugar off his nose, it was a compliment, really, because it showed that she was taking an interest.\\" Of a particularly bad play: \\"One of the critics said he had perhaps seen it at a disadvantage because when he saw it the curtain was up.\\" And of Jeeves's morning conversation with Bertie: \\"The English poet Herrick expressed the same sentiment when he suggested that we should gather rosebuds while we may. Your elbow is in the butter, sir.\\" (All quotes here from \\"Jeeves and The Tie That Binds.\\") <br /> <br />Now, as for Fry and Laurie's rendition of Jeeves and Wooster: it is perfect. And bear in mind that, appearances to the contrary (because Fry and Laurie make it look so effortless), Jeeves and Wooster may be the two most difficult roles in all literature. Bertie must come across as amiable and well-meaning, if a trifle dim, but not a blithering idiot. David Niven tried, and it was a disaster. Jeeves is only slightly less challenging; while he must come across as brilliant and accommodating, he must do so with dignity, with only a minimum of condescension, and with a real fondness for Bertie, something like a mother hen for a slightly addlepated chick. <br /> <br />Fry and Laurie are prefect, as is, by the way, the excellent dramatization and the rest of the ensemble cast. Be warned, however, once you pick up Wodehouse, you'll be hooked forever. Fortunately, his output was prodigious, so you'll have plenty to read and reread, over and over and over. The books never pall; I've read many of them several times and they are always, as Wodehouse titled one of his books, \\"Something Fresh.\\" <br /> <br />By way of literary genealogy, Wodehouse's stylistic heirs are Douglas Adams (of \\"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" fame), Joss Whedon (creator of Buffy, Angel, and the Firefly/Serenity series and film), and Hugh Laurie himself, whose first book \\"The Gun Seller\\" continues in the Wodehouse tradition. For example: \\"I hadn't actually planned on picking his brains, because, to be honest, they weren't properly ripe yet.\\" Or the extraordinary line: \\". . . there's an undeniable pleasure in stepping into an open-top sports car driven by a beautiful woman. Itfeels like you're climbing into a metaphor.\\" And as for Joss Whedon, you can practically tell which Wodehouse books he was reading while writing Buffy. When Giles tells Xander: \\"I suppose there's a certain Machiavellian ingenuity to your transgression,\\" and Xander replies, \\"I resent that. . . .Or possibly, thank you,\\" they might have stepped right out of Wodehouse's \\"Full Moon.\\" For his part, Douglas Adams wrote some of the most purely Wodehousian lines of all time, such as: \\"How do you feel?\\" \\"Like a military academy; bits of me keep passing out.\\"  <br /> <br />So if you want smart, talky, deliciously funny stuff, you can't do better than settling down with the Fry and Laurie's Jeeves and Wooster, apart, of course, from picking up any of Wodehouse's ninety-some books. Fry and Laurie, however, are a wonderful place to start.
B000002IG4|5.0|I didn't think Collins could top his first solo effort, but he sure did - even in his selection of Mowtown tunes. It's clear that Collins still had a lot to say about his failed first marriagne, and-or relationships themselvses - hence, the pleading \\"Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away,\\" and \\"Why Can't It Wait Till Morning,\\" or even the shock of \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\". And his restrengthening is apparent in \\"It Don't Matter To Me,\\" and \\"Do You Know, Do You Care\\". But Collins begins to show a side that will be expected from him on future efforts, both of his own and Genesis. His self deprecating edge in \\"Like China\\" and the quirkiness of \\"Thru These Walls\\" animates this and future efforts more economically than some of the earlier Genesis epics used to, and that formula will become a familiar staple. And you'll get debate over his cover of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\" and whether he does it better or not, though even Collins would never purport to exceed the Supremes. This is the one Collins album that is easy to listen from beginning to end. Great R&B backed by a great brass section (The Hot Tub Club toured with him on this effort), outstanding ballads and great early 80s pop. \\"No Jacket Required\\" will come close, but no future albums will have as broad an appeal. The dependence upon video to promote CDs for the next decade will affect the way Collins music is received in the future, and how he presents it to an extent. And fortunately (or unfortunately), Collins will no longer have his divorce to rely on for emotional depth. I must say (selfishly) that musically, that's too bad.

B000AWYOGE|2.0|An unsettling movie that leaves you hanging, wondering whether you're watching someones's delusions, or their submersion into a creepy reality. To me, the pay off doesn't satisfy that desire to know which it  really is. But half the movie's suspense is wondering whether you're being delivered a horror movie, or a hauntingly real movie that will have some plausible explanation. In that, I was disappointed, particularly with the movies ending. I felt that no sooner was I settled into what this movie really was, the director jerked me around- for lack of a better  comparison, like the ending of \\"Friday the 13th.\\" Not to mislead anyone into thinking this is a movie of that genre's extent. But just as you thought in the original \\"13th\\" that the mother was doing all of the killing, BOOM! Cheatingly, a dream of a disfigured Jason emerging horrifically from the water takes you in a different direction, totally contradicting what the movie led you to believe, and in the process, setting up a slew of sequels based on that redirection. \\"Dark Water\\" had that effect on me. It seemed as if it didn't know what it wanted to be, or that it was toying with me. Is that good directing or bad directing? Perhaps that was the intention of the director all the way. Creepiness describes many aspects of this movie: the characters, the apartment and the neighborhood in which it sets and the atmosphere it creates, and the unsettlingness that comes with a divorce. To be fair, the direction is good at creating a dark atmosphere that leaves you gasping at the possibilities, including the movie's use of the 2 main actors, the mother and daughter combo of Jennifer Connelly and Ariel Gade, who both do a great job in their roles.A huge Connelly fan, I endured a movie that were it starring anyone else, I may not have sat through. In that I salute the director in his casting. Jennifer is her usual outstanding self, but this movie ranks low in her catalogue of films I've viewed (many which I own). And Iwas impressed with the work of the young Gade too. She didn't come off as precocious as, say, the young girl in \\"War of the Worlds\\" who early in that film spat out dialogue way beyond her age range. But I left this movie totally disastisfied. However, it is a very dark movie. Should I have expected otherwise?
B00001OH7O|4.0|Those pointing out this disc is not a 'rocker' are correct: Mick Ronson's guitar is seldom allowed to strut his stuff here so those who only like jam-o-ramas will think this one is \\"weak\\". Instead, there's a lot of focus on strong piano lines to guide the melodies here (YES' Rick Wakeman on the ivories). Midtempo poppers like the well-known \\"Changes\\" and \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" exemplify the sound here.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"Changes\\" is probably the best known tune here, a stuttering challenge to the young about the inevitable passage of time and the search for meaning in life. (\\"Still don't know what I was waiting for/And my time was running wild/A million dead-end streets and/Every time I thought I'd got it made/It seemed the taste was not so sweet\\") Cross-dresser anthem \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\" possesses a can't-miss singalong hook. \\"Life on Mars?\\" is more emblematic of the Robert Zimmerman lyric style than the later \\"Song to Bob Dylan\\" is. (\\"See the mice in their million hordes/From Ibiza to the Norfolk Broads/Rule Britannia is out of bounds/To my Mother, my dog, and clowns\\") Bee Gees soundalike \\"Kooks\\" is Bowie's advice to his then-newborn son. (\\"What to say to people when they pick on you/'Cos if you stay with us you're gonna be pretty kooky too..\\") \\"Andy Warhol\\" picks apart the pop art icon. (\\"He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue/What a jolly boring thing to do\\") \\"Queen Bi*ch\\" is probably the strongest rocker of the bunch here, an ode to a transvestite hooker.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />\\"Eight Line Poem\\" is a low-key twanger that feels more like a song sketch than a finished work. \\"Quicksand\\" pontificates about our human cluelessness about life's meaning and the afterlife (\\"Don't believe in yourself/Don't deceive with belief/Knowledge comes with deaths release\\") but ultimately it's a whimper, not a bang. Bowie chose his stage name to avoid confusion with the Monkees' Davy Jones but deciding to record showtune piffle like \\"Fill Your Heart\\" undercuts the move.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Doesn't feel as strong as [[ASIN:B00001OH7P The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust]] but there's enough solid moments outside of the 'hits' to make it worth picking up, especially since only \\"Changes\\" and \\"Life on Mars?\\" are represented on the [[ASIN:B00006JYI7 Best of Bowie]] doubledisc anthology.<br /><br />3 1/2 starsM LINE:  Doesn't feel as strong as [[ASIN:B00001OH7P The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust]] but there's enough solid moments outside of the 'hits' to make it worth picking up, especially since only \\"Changes\\" and \\"Life on Mars?\\" are represented on the [[ASIN:B00006JYI7 Best of Bowie]] doubledisc anthology.    3 1/2 stars

Read it, and make \\"The Alchimist\\" your journey.
B000E1155E|5.0|Some CDs in my opinion are only worth downloading a few of the good songs and saving yourself some time and money. <br />I would definitly NOT say that about this album. I like every song on this album, they're all great! <br />I can't wait for their next album!! I'm confident saying that I will buy it because it every Arctic Monkeys song I've heard so far was good.
0937381888|5.0|I borrowed, bought and read a few brewing books, but found \\"How to Brew\\" to be the best.  The very first chapter gets you off to a running start should you find yourself with an unpacked brew kit, needing only the most vital information to start brewing immediately. The rest of the book is well written and provides a clear outlay of brewing from the basics to the esoteric.  There are clear explinations, many recipies and a wealth of information regarding the process and ingredients.<br /><br />There are a few other books that are good, but if you own just one brewing book, this is it.<br /><br />Update:3/2008<br />Almost two years later, I have to say this book remains at the forefront of my now expanded beer library.  If you are just starting to brew, if you are curious, if you're looking for a book for someone who is starting out or if you are a brewer looking for an A-Z guide, this remains the one to get. It will provide a foundation of knowledge that will serve you well in your brewing pursuits.<br /><br />Update 2: 2/2010<br />All this time and this book still is indispensable. As I have learned more and become more experienced, How To Brew has been there. I thought that I would pick this book up less and less, but the more skilled I became and the more I learned, the more I reached for this book. My move from extract brewing to all grain was much less difficult and for now, it seems from my experience that John Palmer has written the final word on home brewing to date.

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Low Wattage Horror mishmash lacks not only the right stuff to consider itself a good movie but lacks a competent director who knows what he is doing with the material he is working with and a lead actor who knows how to act. The story makes no sense and does contradict itself at the end of the film and the special effects really don't amount to much at all. Rachel Weisz does give the movie more than it deserved with her great performance but she's basically the only actor in the movie who knows how to act while the rest of the film is filled with actors who can't get past the horrible script that is making this the film as horrible as it is. I had never read the comic book but after a friend begged me to read it after I told him how disappointed I was with the film, I decided to check it out. To my surprise, the comic was not only well written but it was much scarier to boot. I don't know why the powers that be behind the scenes messed up so badly with this film considering the fact that if it stood faithful to the comic book, it would have been an amazing movie but with Keanu Reeves as the lead actor, you know up front that the people behind the scenes really did not care about what they were making. <br /> <br />Avoid.  <br />
0767817710|3.0|The Lady, played by Sharon Stone, arrives at the small town dominated by the cruel and capricious Herod (Gene Hackman) where a quick draw contest is being held. With a series of flashbacks we see why Lady wants to enter the contest--she is a woman set on revenge.<br /><br />Every day each contestant must fight once and the winner proceeds to the next round. The contestants are flamboyant:  the Ace (played by Lance Henrikson); Cantrell the hired gun (Keith David); Spotted Horse, the Indian who boasts that bullets do not kill him (Jonothon Gill); the Kid (Leonardo DiCaprio) is Herod's son; and Russell Crowe plays a preacher who was a former outlaw and forced to be in the contest--he is kept in chains in order to make sure he does not leave.<br /><br />Gene Hackman is excellent as the sadistic, domineering sheriff of the town.  Hackman has such charisma and intensity that when he is with a less talented actor they are diminished; he sucks energy like a black hole.  Di Caprio, while talented, was a little young and green for his role. Crowe is very good--he is the only actor who is not overpowered by Hackman's intensity.<br /><br />Stone does a fairly good job but for me it would have worked better to have a more substantial or tougher actress in this role. Somehow Stone seemed too vulnerable at times. The hero channels death when he is on a mission to kill.  It takes a formidable actor with considerable psychological complexity to make attractive and compelling those moments where we see the individual stripped away and death peering out his eyeballs.<br /><br />The tone of this film is carnival-like, nearly western burlesque like the TV series \\"Wild, Wild West\\". It could serve as homage to Sergio Leone with the use of intense close-ups and Alan Silvestri's soundtrack evokes Morricone, the composer used by Leone.<br /><br />Trivia:  The International version has a sex scene between Crowe and Stone which is cut from this version!
B000B8QEZG|5.0|I am no big fan of Madonna's. Yet I couldn't resist buying this album, and now I can't resist listening to it all over and over. I don't care if this is the sound of the future or else. I love the rhytms, I love the voice, I love the light, inspiring tone of it all. It is fun. It is as simple as that.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. It shows very well the difficulties of the jewish population in Poland during the german occupation. One scene etched in memory is when the jewish labourers are made to wait for a long time before they are allowed to cross the road. They are worried about their jobs , about getting food on their table. The German officers , for their amusement however, make some of them dance while they wait. That was a humiliating unfeeling incident which Polanski had brought out very well. <br /> <br />The main story of course if about the struggle for survival by the young jewish pianist. It is a story well told and well depicted. He survives through illness, hunger and isolation and he is at last heped by a german officer. That was a heartwarming incident in the movies, the prescence of one kind german during those times surrounded by thousands who were subhuman in their cruelty. This one man had the courage to make up his own mind and follow his instinct to save a human being. <br />
B0009AK57Y|5.0|As a kid I was glued to Dr Who in the 1960s and the 1970s. The 1980s saw its slow wind down to eventual cancellation. The 1997 film with Paul McGann proved to be a false dawn but this was not the case with last year's tv series.<br /><br />Christopher Eccleston is simply brilliant in the role of the Doctor , displaying the character's traditional love of the underdog but also possesses an almost scary intensity at times. This intensity replaces the eccentricity of the Doctor's earlier incarnations and we are left with the doctor as an inquisitive but highly charged and volatile individual. This is largely because he is the only survivor of his race, the rest of whom were annihilated in a war with the Daleks. The Doctor reacts with fury as the series goes on when he discovers that the Daleks too have survived, instead of perishing in the war as was previously thought...<br /><br />Billie Piper is great in the role of his travelling companion Rose and her growing relationship with the Doctor is handled well, and keeps the viewer interested.<br /><br />Russell T. Davies who wrote the series is a fan of the old Dr Who and has managed to keep so many of the ingredients of the old series in this one. However, updated SFX and hour long episodes usher the Doctor into 21st century tv.<br /><br />Davies' usual great character realisation works a treat in this, as well as the main characters, all the supporting cast are superb - from Rose's mother to Captain Jack Harkness as the Doctor and Rose's time travelling ally.<br /><br />I won't list all the episodes but they are consistently good and some are outstanding. The episodes that stand out are all of the Dalek appearances, and an episode where Rose goes back in time to meet the father she never knew.<br /><br />Russell T. Davies has written a series with action, wit and humour but also managed to pack in an emotional wallop.<br /><br />The Daleks nearly did not make it into this series due to legal wrangles with the estate of their creator - Terry Nation. Luckily these differences were resolved and the Doctor's greatest foes made it into this series, a little updated but otherwise the same Daleks that we all know.<br /><br />The main villains of the next series will be the Cybermen - another classic foe of the Doctor, and advance shots of them look superb.<br /><br />Sadly Christopher Eccleston called it a day after making this series, however, having seen the Christmas special with his successor - David Tennant in the role, it looks as though Series Two will be business as usual. Tennant while retaining some of Eccelston's intensity, also brings to the role the eccentricity of the former Doctors. I am really looking forward to the imminent start of Series Two now.<br /><br />In the meantime, fans of Christopher Eccleston wanting to see more of him, are recommended to check out the dvd of 'Let Him Have It' which in my opinion is the actor's best ever performance.ry Nation.

B00007G207|5.0|This is a beautiful story of the frienship between toto and Alfredo. And its a beautiful lovestory between Elena and toto. I can't decide which of them is more beautiful, but both could not survive together.Its a long movie, but worth every minute. The childhood and adolescence of toto is captured beautifully. But they seem a backdrop against the evolving friendship between him and Alfredo. It is heartbreaking when Elena and toto are separated but when the truth is finally known, one does not not know at who to direct the anger and it simply fizzles out.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Not only is Titanic the highest grossing movie of all time, but the movie a lone is as classic and royal as the R.M.S Titanic herself. This movie show cases brillant acting, stunts, sets, visual effects and much more eye candy! The 3 disk DVD itself is FULL of special features. I have had the set since it came out and I have yet to make it through the entire movie!! Thats how much depth it has to it. HIGH RECOMENDED!!
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Bought this cd based on the song \\"Crazy,\\" and was pleasantly surprised to learn whole album is just as creative and innovative as that song. A plus- their cover of the Violent Femmes song. I think is the new direction for American music.

0684830485|5.0|It's difficult to point at one work of a writer like Ernest Hemingway and claim it to be the best, but that is the claim that I would make for \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\"<br /><br />This is a story that captures both the true spirit and the doubtful minds of war. It portrays both courage and cowardice, in the beautifully descriptive words that Hemingway was known for. His main character Robert Jordan is an American college instructor who leaves his job to take part in the Spanish Revolution, with a strong conviction in his heart and truly believing that he can make a difference. The story encompasses a time frame of slightly less than three days, during which he plots to blow a strategic bridge at precisely the right time. In those three days he falls in love with a young Spanish girl in the encampment where he is awaiting that moment and is involved in a character conflict with one of the guerrilla fighters by the name of Pablo.<br /><br />This is a well paced story and never boring, with action suspense and romance, all coming together in a setting where you can feel the cold and smell the forest in the way that only Hemingway can describe it. A splendid and beautifully told story that I would recommend to anyone of any age or gender. For that reason I would place \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" at the top of the heap among all of his works.<br /><br />In my opinion this great story is the pinnacle of Hemingway's talent. A must read for anyone interested in great literature.
B00005JP7M|2.0|Though the middle 30 minutes or so are fun, patented Woody Allen witty fun, the bulk of \\"Scoop\\" is listless and lifeless and once again, as he did in \\"Match Point,\\" he manages to make the very human and thoughtful Scarlett Johansson colorless, bland and unattractive though, to be sure, there are moments in which her deadpan humor comes through loud and clear.<br />The basic story is very much like Allen's fantastic \\"Manhattan Murder Mystery\\" but whereas \\"MMM\\" is full of life and fun and boasts a cast (Diane Keaton, Alan Alda, Allen and Anjelica Huston) that actually relate and react to each other and consequently come to life on screen, the trio of Allen, Johansson and the oddly wooden Hugh Jackman...don't.<br />Once again it is fun to see Woody doing his schtick with and at the upper crust English cast and the film looks beautiful. Also on the plus side is the precise performance of Ian McShane as Joe Strombel: the dead reporter who sets the plot in motion.<br />It is apparent that Woody Allen has not found England fertile ground for his genius if \\"Match Point\\" and \\"Scoop\\" are examples of his stay there: for example, the last scene, the denouement of \\"Scoop\\" is depressingly limp and unfocused as if Allen ran out of film to finish the scene properly.<br />Contrary to the evidence here, I know that the Woodman has still got the goods to make strong, witty, involving films. The big question here is When?
B000FVQYYK|2.0|I'm a fan of Muse, but this album leaves me... frankly, bored out of my wits. And, truly, I gave this confused creature so many chances to win me over; I think I've listened to it about fifteen freakin' times, just to make sure I'm not missing 'something'. Alas, my ultimate, disheartening realization is that I never found the buried treasure because, well, I don't even know if it's there. <br /> <br />The biggest problem for me with \\"Black Holes\\" is that it lacks the main element that'd made me a reasonably dedicated fan of Muse in the first place -- drive. 'Absolution' was an album that repeatedly -- I mean, ridiculously so -- climaxed, climaxed, and climaxed again, to the point that one felt they might be experiencing some sort of tantric, musical orgasm. Now, I do admit, the tendency of that album to go so overboard with rousing crests made it a bit obnoxious before a bit of acceptance developed on my part, but once that occured it became stupidly theatrical and unexpectedly endearing, primarily because the vocals were so passionate and the hooks cut into me until I started to get off on the pain. At any rate, it still did suffer from an exaggerated sense of a uniquely uncontrollable, impulsively overwhelming force, leaving the album's flow too disjointed to really work on the whole. This, I can only guess, is what Muse tried to combat possibly with \\"Black Holes\\", but the result (whether or not that was their real goal... probably not -- what do I know?) is so completely the opposite that it throws itself violently to the other side of the spectrum, with pretty dogged results.  <br /> <br />I don't want to get too lengthy here but, yeah, this is essentially an album with an unhealthy, anti-climactic core. At the moment 'Hoodoo' is playing, and it possesses the traditional Muse spirit which I at once fell for. It ROCKS. Anyone who heard the last two Muse albums can attest to this -- they can ROCK, unashamedly so. Along these lines, the surrounding tracks late in the course of the album follow suit; both 'City of Delusion' (despite some nasty strings injected) and 'Knights of Cydonia' are darting pieces of excitement. The problem is -- and I'm pretty confident with this hypothesis -- is had the whole album maintained this tone, Muse would have undoubtedly been stoned for a complete lack of innovation. And, in part, I would have agreed. Unfortunately, by the same token, the results still would have been much more pleasant than what we currently have... A band stepping into some sort of uncharted territory that, in most respects, doesn't work.  <br /> <br />'Starlight' charms initially with its childish melody, but one later finds themself deceived, as it becomes clear you're floating in an abyss of nothingness -- never would I expect such a song from the band that is so, in limbo... It just sort of sits there, not knowing where to go... so it doesn't even try. 'Suppermassive Black Hole' is different enough that it peaks interest, but the pitch of the vocals is too high, with the predictable electronics masking nothing while the Queen-esque vocal harmonies only accentuate a horrid chorus. And with both of these songs and the other failures on the disc (I sound way more harsh than I mean to... I know these guys put a lot of work into this), one fundamental flaw stands out -- the tempo is exceedingly slow. This naturally is the antithesis of the Muse I've known -- as I've already boringly gone on about -- but it really dampens the entire album, rarely letting it bloom. 'Exo-Politics' has a totally groovy guitar lick, but these guys just can't make anything standout when working at such a speed. Muse's choruses have always been simple, but the notes work melodically with the blistering pace and guitars. They still maintain some degree of likable pop sentiment here, but, hell, they just can't fill in the gaps... They can't jump the hurdle the boggled down tempo throws at them. <br /> <br />Ah... I do this with reviews, go on a spree and then poop myself out so I don't want to write anymore. The thing is, I don't disrespect this album one bit -- I just don't really like it. That, in itself, is worth something, but on the other hand, there is too much good stuff out there, and if I'm honest with myself I know I'll never throw the disc in with the coming years... Hence, two stars.  <br /> <br />Will I still await their next release with hope? Yes sir.
0393057658|4.0|This book was my introduction to sabermetrics, and proved to be quite a thrilling introduction. The application of truly smart statistical work the game of baseball in Billy Beane and the Oakland A's had me hooked from page one. Great material.<br /><br />It did seem to drag on a little, however. The first half of the book was thrilling. The end started to feel like more of the same old same old. But it's still worth finishing.
B00009MGR6|1.0|...because after hearing this I felt like blowing up my copy of Blow up Your Video. It's better than Flick of the Switch (not saying much), and This Means War is a good song. As for the rest... don't even get my started. Popular favorites Heatseeker and That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll both suck, and the rest is even worse. Again, I'm a fan of This Means War but that's the extent of it.
B00005OMTT|4.0|As a fan of ENIGMA I purchased this cd just recently,altough it isn't a new release.You can find on it most of their best titles of their earlier albums.My personal 'highlight' of this cd would be the number: 'tnt for the brain'.  Overall a good compilation that's certainly worth the purchase!
B00005614M|5.0|The auspicious title really does say it all for this collection of trumpeter Miles Davis' 1949 nonet dates. In these dozen performances a whole new school of jazz was created, as former beboppers Davis and drummer Max Roach joined forces with progressive composers, arrangers and players such as Gil Evans, Gerry Mulligan and John Lewis to explore the subtler and moodier side of the genre from a vituoso's standpoint. Mellow as the results are for the most part, there's a world of complexity and detail to be found here which no self-respecting jazzhead (nor anyone else who really cares about music) can afford to miss.     As would often be the case throughout his long and varied career, Davis is featured on these sessions primarily as a player and crafter of atmosphere. Despite having brought the sizeable combo (which also featured such famed blowers as Lee Konitz on alto saxophone and Kai Winding on trombone) together and serving as its nominal head, the Maestro takes only one half-credit as a composer on these dates, with the bulk of the charts coming from Mulligan, Lewis and of course Evans, whose big band orchestrations had provided Miles with his initial inspiration. These other gentlemen would also incorporate the innovations realized on the BIRTH OF THE COOL sessions far more extensively into their respective subsequest careers than would the trumpeter himself, thus marking this classic set of recordings as not only a once-in-a-lifetime supergroup summit, but a truly pivotal moment in jazz history.
B000EULJLU|4.0|I think the 3D art is awesome. Great album that grows on you. It has a few ding ding bang bang songs though. You know what I mean, the kind that move slow with some chanting or some drums, on the edge of your seat, then never just kick in and rip some bad guitar and CRANK! Do you like Tool? Then buy it. End of story.
0446577383|4.0|Most government spy thrillers are boring to me, but by using the odd characters who somehow got together and formed \\"The Camel Club\\" it had a more interesting feel to it. The ending was a little far-fetched, but the author made you care very much for the characters and what would happen to them.  For that and the fact that the last 1/3 of the book was a page-turner, I gave the book an above-average 4 stars.
B000002H6C|5.0|This was my favorite album from the time it was released until about 5 or 6 years later. I guess I was about 16 when it was released and it was exactly what I was looking for, powerful, cathartic, melodic, intelligent (a lot of the characteristics we see described here in other reviews). This album is just amazing and in my opinion, it was the last amazing album by Metallica. Nothing they have done since comes close, sadly. There are songs to be sure, but not whole albums like this and those that came before. For me, Justice was their peak. I still break it out once in a while now and its been 16 years. That's a classic.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|So much archival footage and interviews with folkies, beatniks, poets, singers, you name it - this dvd has it all- very extensive. I am not a major Dylan fan -but you have to dig this pixie who roils the waters - Liam Clancy put it best when he said that Bob Dylan was a 'shape changer\\" in the tradition of Irish mythology- \\"they change voices, they change faces\\"- and that's what Bob Dylan was guilty of .You don't have to embrace \\"Bobby\\" as a saviour to like him or this DVD - you can take what you like and leave the rest behind. that's what I did and I didn't have to leave much-
B000F3AAUW|2.0|The phenom that is Gnarls Barkley is super-tough to quantify.  Every season carries along a smash hit or six, the reasons for whose immense popularity frickin' elude me.  (Recent bearers of that torch:  John Mayer's \\"Daughters\\" -- the hands-down worst multiple-Grammy-winner since \\"Sailing\\"; the immeasurably wretched \\"My Humps\\" -- for which my boyfriend, months and months on, still can't look me in the eye and truly explain his devotion; and every last entry in the Pussycat Dolls' bunkum-riddled oeuvre -- don't cha wish they'd, like, go the hell away??)  Atop that pile, I'll happily toss \\"Crazy,\\" the inescapable colossus that presently bestrides summer's musical landscape.  On the one hand, it's a marvel, a hookless confection of anything-goes maverick spirit that shatters every formula popular music ever thought about implementing (is it pop?  Is it gospel?  Is it Memorex?), and radio, in these days of stale strangled playlists and line-toeing program directors, should be congratulated for casting its lot with such a bold dark horse.  On the other hand, boiled down to its barest elements, it's really just a couple of notches above any given left-field novelty hit, the kind of tune from whose teats top 40 radio has always loved to suckle.  (The screwy songs are forever the ones that get people talking the loudest, and when you can get people talking, you can get people listening.)  And on that scale -- with, say, Paul Hardcastle's shellshocked `80s triumph \\"19\\" standing at the top of the heap, and Rick Dees' execrable \\"Disco Duck\\" bringing up the rear -- my bet is that, in ten years, when the crisp hindsight of a decade has given us proper perspective, \\"Crazy\\" will be shivering in a flimsy bedroll betwixt \\"Kung Fu Fighting\\" and \\"Sex and Candy\\" while, upstream, \\"How Bizarre\\" and \\"Everybody's Free (to Wear Sunscreen)\\" roast marshmallows around a crackling campfire.
B000089Q9D|5.0|Time wise, it takes approximately three hours to watch all of CINEMA PARADISO (Director's cut), but just as this film has become a timeless classic, it seems that whenever I see it, time stands still. It has a magical quality that is impossible to resist. I suppose the reason is that while it revolves around the world of film--a little boy falling in love with film while under the auspices of a cranky old projectionist, most of us probably have a passion of one sort or anther, whether it be a profession or avocation and we remember the moment we fall in love with our subject and the person who made that love possible. How many writers remember a teacher, librarian, or bookseller who instilled a love of books, an artist who can remember meeting a \\"real artist\\" who becomes a mentor as a child, or an athlete who remembers that one and only coach? These people inspire us and in many ways CINEMA PARADISO celebrates such people.<br /><br />The story itself takes place in a small Italian village. The one relief to a somewhat hard and tedious life is a small movie theatre that shows films after they've been approved by the local priest who insists that any scenes with kissing be removed. A fatherless boy named Toto (short for Salvatore) sneaks into the movies and pesters the projectionist Alfredo. Toto begins to grow on Alfredo who teaches him his craft. Eventually Alfredo teaches him more than lessons about film, and becomes the catalyst for the greater person Toto will become in later years. Perhaps what makes this film so powerful is that while it enters familiar territory, it's never predictable and the story has many twists that viewers would not suspect.<br /><br />The actors who play Toto as a boy (Salvatore Cascio) and as a young adult (Marco Leonardi) are superb. Cascio's Toto is enough to drive any one nuts, but he's lovable and we know all he needs is a bit of direction. The teenaged Toto of Leonardi is a nuanced performance. He deals with love, acceptance, and teenaged angst but not in an overwhelming way, and we also see him develop into an intelligent and enterprising young man, (with perhaps the exception of his term as a soldier). Philippe Noiret's Alfredo is likewise well done. We see a genuine love for Toto develop and we know he means well even when he errs. Agnese Nano and Antonella Attili deserve praise for their roles as Elena Tito's first love and his beleaguered but loving mother respectively.<br /><br />The film is filled with dramatic intensity, mixed with a bit of humor, (who can't help but love parish priest/film censor Fr. Adelfio played by Leopoldo Trieste) and genuine emotion. The village in Italy is believable and perhaps what most film buffs will love are the clips in Italian of all sorts of great films. It's no wonder this film is a perennial favorite and will certainly become an all time classic.and teenaged angst but not in an overwhelming way, and we also see him develop into an intelligent and enterprising young man, (with perhaps the exception of his term as a soldier).

0375830995|5.0|I think it was the ending of the book that made this book so amazing!! First, you know it's going to be good because it's an Alfred Knopf book.. but past that.. it has such an inspiring message.<br /><br />And then, if you are a writer at all, in any way.. I almost guarantee that you will get excited over the imagination of the writer and how he brings it all together in the end.<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting, and I have to say that I am on a high now from it- and just so excited over the possibilities that the writer brought about with this book.<br /><br />I really, truly thought that it was an amazing and inspirational read!
B000AJJNPY|5.0|Sigur Ros is a band that defies description. Their music combines rock guitar, haunting vocals, and ingenuity to create a sound that is otherworldly--not quite rock, not quite easy listening. Try to imagine what superintelligent extra terrestrials would choose to listen to and you might have some idea what Sigur Ros sounds like. <br /> <br />Listen up, earthings: with the release of their lastest album, \\"Takk\\" (pronouced \\"talk,\\" or so I've heard) there has never been a better time to discover Sigur Ros. <br /> <br />Most Sigur Ros fans like think \\"()\\" is their best album, but I disagree. \\"Takk\\" is much more upbeat and layered than their album \\"()\\" and more diverse, to boot. Every single track is overflowing with melody and emotion. \\"Takk\\" is therefore my favorite. <br /> <br />Don't be deterred by the length of the songs--art should never be rushed. The thirty second samples they give on Amazon are just not enough to let the music shine. <br /> <br />You probably won't be able to understand the Icelandic lyrics, but you won't miss them. Just listen to the hope in \\"Glosloli,\\" the conflict in \\"Saeglopur\\" or the agony in \\"Gong.\\" Sigur Ros transends words and communicates straight to the heart.  <br /> <br />So open up your mind and try something new. \\"Takk\\" is a sure bet.
B00006F83Y|4.0|A great album. Not perfect. The songs themselves are addictive, inventive despite sounding like something you've heard before, crunchy and sexy. I love how Holme's voice changes from song to song. A great vocalist, which leads me to wonder why Eagles of Death Metal has him on drums and that Macho Macho Man wanabe on vocals. The real star of this album though is the guy who's not even in the band, Dave Grohl. His drum playing on this album is incredible. Good stuff. Get rid of the annoying radio clips and the terrible 6th song and it would deserve a 5/5.
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|I wanted to pluck out each and every one of these guys and feed them a sandwich- they were so skinny- How refreshing- and Leon Russell's pale arms with no tatoos- and the long silver hair. Wow. how about all of the chainsmoking on stage- I do believe that Eric Clapton had a cigarette holder on his guitar fret- wow again. How times have changed .Seriously, if you want to buy this concert footage just for the music- that's ok too. There is a ton of stuff to enjoy . Most outstanding is the fact that this do-gooder deed- a benefit concert to aid a humanitarian effort - was totally groundbreaking , and they were all there to have fun and all that.Good stuff.
0140277447|5.0|I am writing this review because I am very disturbed by the review from the reader called \\"0000 teecee0000\\" and his/her serious lack of basic history knowledge.  <br /> <br />First, Iris Chang is a Chinese American who was born and educated in the U.S. This book was written and published only in U.S. So it's ridiculous to call her as \\"a victim of forced censorship and a pawn of the Communist propaganda machine\\". Is U.S. a communist country?  <br /> <br />Second, communist government had not come to power when Nanking massacre happened. The Chinese government at that time fought and failed to defend Nanking, which was how the massacre happened. Many European countries fought and failed to stop Nazi Germany's invasion during WWII. Was that because the government \\"allowed this to happen\\"? <br /> <br />If \\"0000 teecee0000' had a bit knowledge about what happened in the \\"pearl harbor\\" (which I highly doubt), he/she would understand this book and history better.  <br /> <br />After the publishing of this book, Iris Chang received numerous death threats and harassments from right-wing Japanese who still worship Japanese war criminals and regard them as \\"national heroes\\". As a result, she committed suicide in her car. (Google for details).  <br /> <br />I am not saying Iris Chang is 100% accurate. But denying Nanking massacre would like denying Hitler's atrocities.  <br />Like it or not, history is history. <br />

B00005JOMN|3.0|I think you hit the nail on the head. I've been a vice fan since 84 and it just doesn't work to field an Irish actor to play a southern law enforcement gent. The exciting car chases weren't there. I got more from the movie trailers. Crockett and Tubbs changed to a black BMW at the gunfight? Afraid to mess up the $300K Ferrari F430 Spider? This is the worst acting of Farrell and Foxx. Elvis the croc in the original vice was a better actor. I can't shake off Farrell's Alexander look with Farrell's bad hair day on almost every scene of the movie. That happens when you try to pass of a dark haired Irish guy for a blonde ex-football beach bum cop. Crockett's 3 day stubble turned to be a Mexican mustache with a bonus Elvis Presley sideburns. The characters are one dimensional. I think covering it with gratuitous sex would somehow allevate their lack of depth...wrong! The dialougue and plots are confusing. Don Johnson may not be the greatest actor in the world but he nailed the cop character way better than Farrell did. Farrel was mumbling his lines under the mustache you can't figure out what he is saying. His Irish accent is just too obvious. Or maybe he doesn't care anymore? What happened to the leak? The music did not even touch the toes of Jan Hammer's original score on the tv series. Except for the gun fight scene which was brilliantly orchestrated, I'd rather watch the worst Vice 84 reruns anytime.
B00002DF9N|4.0|What admirable interpretations from B&ouml;hm!  He breathes so much character into each of the musical \\"paragraphs\\" in these readings.  Each theme is given its own distinct tempo, chosen with exceptional judgement to emphasize its idiosyncracies and expressive character; and B&ouml;hm can turn his orchestra on a dime when a good deal of contrast is called for between the end of one paragraph and beginning of the next.  There's also enourmous dynamic range and contrast, form the softest pianissimi to thundering fortissimi.  These are readings that really bring out the broad ebb and flow of these long pieces, emphasizing the structure, the architecture of them.  They're really fantastic.<br /><br />Do be warned, though, that the recorded sound is very dated: generally it's rather one-dimensional and the resolution is not very high, so that you mostly hear only the most prominent voices of the ensemble at any given time.  It's at its worst in the Alpine Symphony, which sounds like a scratchy, screechy 1930's film soundtrack.  In the rest of the pieces it ranges from good to serviceable; but if there's any repertoire that really benefits from today's high-fidelity recording technology, massive post-Romantic orchestral scores like these are certainly a front-runner.  Buy this set for the marvellous interpretations, but you'll want to explore other, better-recorded readings as well to really hear the full depth and resonance of the orchestral sound.
B0000024W3|1.0|I bought this album in 2005 never having heard it because of the all the terrible reviews I'd read. And after owning it for about a year, I have only listened to to it once and played it a total of 3 times. In my opinion the only song worth listening to is The Days of '49, which reminds of something that could have come from the Basement Tapes. <br /> <br />Yes, it's true that Dylan has always been an artist who aviods pigeon holing, as there really is no single category of music he fits into, but that's no excuse for this pile of rubbish. It's 74 minutes of painful hearing that I can't wait to get through so I can hear the next ablum, New Morning on the Dylan list. And it's fine for Dylan to release and record whatever he wants to, but I have to believe that HE never listens to this album either. <br /> <br />He seems bored and tired and just doesn't care whether he puts down a single good track-- the live versions of Quinn, the Eskimo (surprsingly put on the greatest hits volume 2 collection!), Like a Rolling Stone, She Belongs to Me are so lifeless it's like he was trying to irritate the audience. \\"Let's get this over with as soon possible so I can go sleep in the hotel.\\" There really is nothing redeeming about this album other than the track I listed, though I have to admit I find the opening number catchy although it goes on two and half minutes to long. <br /> <br />Again, if you're a Dylan head, get it, but if you're looking for a fine album to add to your collection, this is not it.
0345350499|5.0|A wonderful twist on a classic tale - I've loved Arthurian legend since the first time I saw Camelot performed with Julie Andrews and Richard Harris.  Ever since I've read any version of the story I could get my hands on - which have included various tellings form Arthur's point of views as well as Gueniverre, Lancelot and of course Merlin.  The Mists of Avalon is by far one of my favorites because here the usual villan, Morgaine (a.k.a. Morgan La Fay) is the main character and are lead through the tale seeing it through her eyes which as you can imagine sheds a completely different light on things.  This book is fabulous - I'm sure you will enjoy it completely.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I have viewed the 2 versions the BBC put out and now this one. While I like the casting of characters in this one, the setting left a LOT to be desired, and the shortness left out the development of the characters and the relationships. Jane and Lizzy have little warmth or closeness in this version as there is no time to develop the relationship. Everything is too much abbreviated for comfort. Anyone seeing this and not having read the book as often as I and some other avid readers would come away feeling it was too shallow a story. Few of the statements from the book carry into the movie, as they did in the BBC versions. It's too different from the book for my liking, although I will continue to view it from time to time along with the others.

B000B8QEZG|4.0|Madonna has always been viewed as a chameleon in every sense of the word. Actor, trend-setter, mother, diva, spiritualist, songwriter, sex-kitten etc. - you name it and the chances are Madonna has either tried it or wishes to do it. Ever since Madonna hit the music scene in the early eighties, she has constantly caught the attention of media and fans alike. She has portrayed a variety of images - from the daring erotica-look to the trendy cowboy-look, yet her various image changes have always harmonised with her music releases. The Confession On A Dancefloor album witness a Madonna, which has adopted a modern disco-look for the album cover and music videos. So does the dance look influence the music style on Confession On A Dancefloor? The answer is a roaring YES!!      As the first single Hung Up from the album hit the airwaves, I instantly like the song. However, the sound of the album certainly had me surprised. The dance, electronic and techno-influences dominate the album, which may not be to the liking of everybody. But if you enjoyed Hung Up and the second single Sorry, it is very likely that you will adore the rest of the album. Confessions On A Dancefloor begins with the danceable Hung Up, which has cemented Madonna' ability to create a superb, infectious dance track to get everybody to wear their dancing boots. Get Together is the third single, I believe, displaying another fast-paced, upbeat track. The trance-like elements are quite dominating within the song, creating a dreamy atmosphere to allure the listener into the track. Future Lovers starts off with a spoken intro, however as soon as the song really comes to life, it becomes obvious that it is a brilliant track. It is definitely among my favourite songs on the album. Up next is the rather cheesy I Love New York. Not surprisenly, it is an ode to the wonderful city of New York. Describing her love for New York with corny lyrics, Madonna reveals she does not care what the world thinks of her `'If youdon't like my attitude/You can F off''. The pace of the melody reminds me of the activity which is often associated with `'The city that never sleeps''. The `'synthesised'' Let It Will Be showcases Madonna revealing her thoughts on fame and success. The violin-intro resembles the beginning of Papa Don't Preach, which another reviewer also draws attention to. Undoubtedly a success if released as a single, it is actually quite catchy.       Forbidden Love is an upbeat, mid-tempo instalment with a dreamy chorus. Displaying similar features of 1980s synthesiser pop, Forbidden Love is an enjoyable offering. One may argue that Madonna is no music genius but then again nor has she ever claimed to be, yet her willingness to experiment with different genres is admirable. Naturally, it is debatable whether or not one thinks its successful each time; however, Madonna appears to have realised her limitations and uses the talents she does have: taking chances. A safe bet for the fourth single would be the excellent Jump. A fast-pace, dance offering which will surely have everyone rushing to the dancefloor. The vocoder-effect is quite dominating on the rather blend How High, which tend to get a tad annoying, and Madonna's voice certainly doesn't help the situation either. The controversial, yet brilliant Isaac could easily have been mistaken for a Ray Of Light track. The sway-like vocals of Madonna have one thinking of the excellent Frozen from her spiritual Ray of Light era. Push sounds rather gloomy at first, still the topic is slightly more positive - a thank you to the person who pushed/helped the singer during various stages in her life. The last track of the album, the funky Like It Or Not, displays Madonna's attitude to the world: Like her or not, she will continue to do things her way `'and you can F off if you don't like her attitude''.      Confessions On A Dancefloor is not an album which will appeal to everybody. Its sound will surely prevent some people from purchasing the album. Despite these objections, Confessions On A Dancefloor is actually quite enjoyable. One may argue that there are no obvious hits and I tend to agree. Hung Up was the obvious choice for the first single, yet the singles Sorry and Get Together are, however, not among the best songs on the album but they are the among the catchiest. Confessions On A Dancefloor is Madonna's best album since Ray Of Light. YES, it is even better than her 2000 release Music as well as the dreadful American Life. However, it is not without flaws. In general, I have difficulties separating some of the fast-paced songs from one another. To my ears, they sound quite similar at times. Another issue is the cheesy lyrics, which are featured in several of the songs. Overall, Confessions On A Dancefloor is a solid effort, displaying one again Madonna's chameleon abilities to change music style as she sees fit.    Overall Rating: 7.5/10
B0002W18MU|5.0|In the first four American Recording albums, Johnny Cash tackled the issues of sin and redemption, questioned his faith, and ultimately came to terms with his steady march toward death, knowing that full forgiveness awaited him.  <br /> <br />The latest in the American Recordings series - A Hundred Highways - comes nearly three years after his death and was recorded during the time his wife June died and while his health was steadily failing. As with the four previous albums and the unfortunately named boxset of outtakes - Johnny Cash Unearthed - we have Rick Rubin recording Johnny tackling old standards, new compositions, and surprising covers with spare production and minimal backup. <br /> <br />We find a number of themes in A Hundred Highways -- reaction to June's death... professions of faith, but the overriding theme is one of reflection. He starts off with a prayer -- asking God to help him. His voice is so frail and mournful that you almost feel that he's asking for help to finish the album he's just embarked upon, knowing that it's his last one and needs God to get these songs out. <br /> <br />The second song, God's Gonna Cut You Down finds Johnny in stronger voice, bringing out the fire and brimstone preacher first uncovered in The Wanderer on U2's Zooropa album and more recently in The Man Comes Around from American Recordings 4. This time the old preacher is pulling no punches, no more hints of redemption from this preacher -- only dire warnings that if you sin, God's gonna cut you down. If you aren't scared straight with this song, your soul is already lost. <br /> <br />Songs such as Like the 309, If You Could Read My Mind, On the Evening Train, and Rose of My Heart, are obvious reactions to June, her death, and his love for her. The old Hank Williams song On the Evening Train is especially poignant. <br /> <br />The second half of the album is where Johnny's spirit really comes through. These songs take on an almost confessional tone, an accounting of a full life lived, and ultimately, death and redemption. Sung in the past tense, these songs find Johnny reflecting back on his time on earth. I Came to Believe is the story of Johnny's faith, while Love's Been Good to Me his love for June. The album ends on a high note as Johnny tells us not to grieve his death, we'll meet again in the song Four Strong Winds. I'm Free from the Chain Gang Now is a celebration of Johnny becoming unshackled from his failing corpreal body, a body no longer able to contain its undying spirit.  <br /> <br />I've loved all the American Recording albums and the Unearthed boxset. However this album hit me hard. A Hundred Highways finds Johnny Cash at his most frail and vulnerable while at the same time strengthened by the knowledge that his faith has brought him redemption and everlasting life by God's side. A must have for your CD collection. <br />
B000F6IOC0|2.0|I haven't seen the first Underworld but I thought the storyline was easy to adapt to especially when you go to watch this film with an Underworld enthusiast. My major concern was the lack of a concrete storyline, haphazard direction, predictability and lack of surprise the film offers. Relax, I'm not the first person who ever watched a film without watching the prequel. I don't know if I should complain on the acting front cause it was decent. I quite liked the villain's character but there was not much this film offered with a thin plot.<br /><br />I'll name two better films, Poseidon and King Arthur<br /><br />Underworld : Evolution was definitely better than Van Helsing though.<br /><br />Almost nothing about this film is extraordinary or remotely unique
0679422714|5.0|Having read Chang Jung's book, MAO, I have obtained a substantial insight of one of modern history's most colossal and mythical figures; In the pantheon of the \\"incarnates\\", regardless of their deeds, Mao is certainly to be categorized as one of the top-brass ubermensch, (to borrow a Nietzschean terminology), along with the statues of Napoleon, Lincoln, Hitler, and Stalin. All of them had single-handedly shaped the course of human experience with an earthshaking might and a sublimated legacy which is bound to endure into eternity. It is safe to conjecture that Mao was an unordinary prodigy of his time, who posed to me as a redoubtable juggernaut! Juxtaposing to the Anima of his red dragon-like scale, I am indeed being dwarfed as a little boy, who only possesses the passion and courage like that of David and Siegfried.<br /><br />If Mao indeed represents everything that I'm opposing, if I am even probing on the periphery of the possibility of casting away the Red-spell, I need to study this man inside-out with a zealous inquisition in order to pierce into the heart of this red-worshipping phenomenon, which until this date still possesses the infatuation of millions of Chinese. Having read thus far, the following are some conclusions which are rational to enumerate:<br /><br />1. Mao's whole life capsulated the Chinese history of Modern era. To analyze and interpret him is to explain the Chinese destiny of the 20th Century.<br /><br />2. China at the end of the 19th Century and the beginning of 20th Century was a land of PANDEMONIUM. Mass majority of the population were \\"dirt-poor\\", (as said by the author in the notes of the book), and had been utterly impoverished and dispossessed by natural and man-made catastrophes. After the fall of the Manchu Dynasty, the whole country was divided into numerous arbitrarily carved out regions monopolized by vying warlords. This phenomenon was being further exploited by different types of ambitious daredevils whose aim was to conquer the whole country--the Japanese imperialism; Moscow's secret Red subversion with its infamous COMINTERN's agent, CCP; as well as the demon-incarnated and the self-perceived as the \\"mandate-of-heaven\\", Mao.<br /><br />3. Mao indeed possessed that extraordinary aura surrounding him and emanated an infinitely exuberant charisma, which easily bend the knees of a Folk with a millennium-old tradition of emperor-worshipping.<br /><br />4. Due to China's economic backward condition and the deplorable under-educated masses at the turn of the 20th Century, it was indeed the most attractive haven for communist/Bolshevist/Proletarian/Socialist propagation. When the world saw the triumph of the October Revolution and the establishment of the Soviet Union, it made even more ordinary Chinese, (most of them being poor!!) wanting to create a Red state of their own. Both of my grandparents were among the millions who had been enchanted by this egalitarian-like Proletariat Ruled utopian fantasy.<br /><br />5. If people had to choose from the warlords, (which means the disintegration of China), the Japanese, (which means the colonization of China), the KMT, (which means the embracing of an inept governing of a corruption-saturated Nanjing administration and perpetual \\"Capitalist/feudal/imperial\\" exploitation), and the Reds, (who promised a phony panacea to relieve all China's demise and establish an Orwellian \\"animal farm\\" of their own), the majority kindhearted innocent civilians will easily incline toward the latter, consider you don't need too much brain power to plant seditious propaganda among factory workers and rustic peasants to foment riot and confrontation!<br /><br />In summary, I would just like to add that by this time everyone had forgot all about that abortive infant republican government of Beijing whose fleeting existence only lasted for 17 years, (1911-1928), and which was destroyed by the KMT's Northern Expedition! It is rightly to speculate as hindsight that Chiang Kai Shek's fatal mistake was to oust the Beijing government and destroyed the Five-Color Flag, which represented all of the Hope of a New China. Granted that the Beijing government was just as incompetent and fallible, it was nonetheless the central authority with official international recognition. When Chiang invalidated the power of the First Republic and tried to foster his own out of scratch, he was once again lurching as a fledgling and bound to be inflicted with hideous assaults from all fronts. At the meantime, in the eyes of all beholders of Chiang's militant intention to unify China was so that the country will be monopolized under the KMT dictatorship, symbolized by the new flag with their own party emblem, the White Sun, on it! This fateful blow was to strengthen all factions with their own treacherous aim--the Japanese, the Warlords, and last but not least, the REDS!hindsight that Chiang Kai Shek's fatal mistake was to oust the Beijing government and destroyed the Five-Color Flag, which represented all of the Hope of a New China.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|The 2006 production of Pride and Prejudice is a work of photographic art. Breathtaking scenery, creative and graceful camera movements, and smooth transitions make this film a visual pleasure. A romantic and sweeping score carries you along through the classic story.  <br /> <br />The actors in this film, provided that they had a limited amount of time to develop their characters on screen, did a remarkable job, although sometimes some spoke too quickly, almost rushed, as if trying to get it over with. There is, however, a wonderful chemistry between all of them. Two thumbs up for the casting director, as well as the actors themselves.  <br /> <br />I personally love Jane Austen's classic story, and while I am a huge fan of the BBC version (starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle as Darcy and Elizabeth), I can say that I really do enjoy this new film. It certainly is much shorter and easier to watch in one sitting, although bits of the storyline are lost in the shortness of it.  <br /> <br />Overall, I highly recommend this film to anyone. If you haven't seen it, I recommend renting it, to see if you like it. If you end up liking it as much as I do, you just may end up purchasing it like me, too.

0790729628|4.0|In the not-too distant future, replicants - nearly perfect organic-robotic machines - are difficult to distinguish from ordinary humans. A crew of 6 of these creatures has escaped from exile and has returned to Earth. Deckard, a retired replicant hunter, or Bladerunner, is called back to duty to \\"retire\\" them.<br /><br />There is a lot of spooky weirdness about the setting of the movie. The locale seems to be an amalgam of New York City, Tokyo and Hong Kong, with lots of enormous neon billboards high on buildings, and lots of hustle-bustle on the streets below. Police cruise the city in aircars, and the citizens scurry, mole-like, through the maze of buildings and streets below. The musical score is haunting and disturbing, and frequently got on my nerves, yet was creepily appropriate for the film.<br /><br />Sets aside, the plot revolved around Decker's apparent distaste for his work. It's not apparent from the film why this might been, but it might revolve around issues of how similar the replicant are to humans. Are they menaces to terrestrial peace and security? Like humans, are they autonomous beings desperately trying to steal another day of life? Can they love and be loved? Having raised these questions, the film doesn't try hard to address them, and the last half of the movie is an extended, dull and preposterous cat-and-mouse game between Decker and the replicants, led by the incredible Rutger Hauer.<br /><br />Shortcomings aside, Bladerunner was worth seeing, just for the sets and the discussions it inspires. How will humans react when their machines are fundamentally indistinguishable from -- even superior to -- their creators? The movie's writing fails to engage this situation adequately, but the visuals make up for this lack.<br /><br />For my money, the director's cut is superior to the original. The occasional narration in the original was jarring puerile and almost laughable, adding little to the understanding of the movie. Better to do without it and to risk possible confusion. Really neat, with reservations.out it and to risk possible confusion. Really neat, with reservations.
6305232660|1.0|<br />This film is so bad that being forced to watch it could be used as a penalty for warcrimes. It is as scientifically realistic as the Roadrunner cartoons and has all the character development of a Geico commercial.  <br /> <br />Out of the hundreds of films that I have watched in my lifetime, of every stripe and quality, this is the first one that was so utterly vapid and feeble-minded that I began fast-forwarding through simply so that I could see the meteor hit and make the big wave. If this film were a sexual encounter, both partners would have fallen asleep during the foreplay. <br /> <br />Life is far too precious to waste on this skanky turtle of a film. <br />
0064471837|5.0|So many reviews on Amazon harp on about how boring the fantasy genre has become, how predictable the plots and characterizations are.  Not so with Garth Nix!  I have read plenty run-of-the-mill fantasy (and even like most of it), but he stands entirely on his own.  I will admit, it took some effort on my part to get into the story - after all, there are a ton of completely new concepts to take in - but it was more than worth the effort.  The characterization and overall writing style was very well done, but it was the world and new ideas that stuck with me the most.  The rest of the series likewise lives up to this exceptional starting novel.  Though the series is often categorized as young adult, there are plenty of adult concepts that make this appealing to readers of all ages.

0060922583|1.0|I became interested in a holographic universe theory when I perused and regretfully did not buy a Scientific American issue on the subject.  Too bad, because I'm sure the theory would have come under strict scientific scrutiny with maybe a glimpse of the far-out possibilities.  This book starts very promising, discussing the beginnings of this model by Bohm and Pribram.  After chapter two, however, as some previous reviewers have noted, the book descends into witchcraft and lunacy.  The book would have been better off in the New Age section of the bookstore, not the science section, the reason I was fooled into buying it.  I must say, I tried to read it over the course of three nights, and ended up throwing it out.  Mr. Talbott unfortunately belies his lack of scientific knowledge/training by writing the last three-quarters of the book on the paranormal.  Save your money.
0552998486|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - the added detail and mood created a story far superior to the movie, which just skimmed the surface of the concepts here. I love the contrast of the restrictive, hatefulness of the minister and church-goers with the pagan protagonist's generous love and unconditional giving - it spoke volumes to me about the hypocracy of the church and its so often hateful, exclusory ways. Love and generosity know no religion; they are choices we each make in how we treat one another. The ending in particular packed a whallop for me. Powerful, great read.
B000EMGAGW|3.0|When considering Mobb Deep's latest album, Blood Money, I think I'll stay away from the obvious question (\\"What the hell are Mobb Deep doing on G-Unit?\\"). What I WILL say, though, is that I'm still surprised that people didn't like Havoc and Prodigy's last album, Amerika'z Nightmare. Sure, it wasn't a classic, and it may seem terrible when compared to The Infamous or Hell On Earth, but as I said in my review for that album, that really isn't fair. At any rate, that album is still better that Hav and P's G-Unit debut.<br /><br />After listening to this album, I really had no idea what to rate it. In fact, giving it three stars might even be generous because the album is just dull. There really aren't any CLASSIC songs on here; in fact, the only songs that could possibly stand a rewind are \\"Smoke It\\", \\"Put Em In Their Place\\" and \\"Speakin So Freely\\". And Prodigy's problem of declining lyrical skills is still evident on this album; in addition, he even raps just like Havoc sometimes (see \\"Capital P, Capital H\\").<br /><br />And that song makes absolutely no sense. Other skippable tracks include the Tony Yayo-assisted \\"Click Click\\" (Yayo on a track called \\"Click Click\\"? Gee, I wonder what THAT song is about!). Blatant radio-friendly jams also fail, as evidenced by the necessary song for the ladies, \\"Give It to Me\\", but worse than that is \\"Have a Party\\", which should have never made it out of the studio. Even worse, though, is the groupie ode \\"Backstage Pass\\", which is as awful as everyone says it is.<br /><br />I'm also not sure why the \\"Outta Control\\" remix got stuck on here as a bonus track; and the Mobb have no business introducing a song called \\"The Infamous\\" on an album like THIS. Also, the second verse of just about every song on here ends badly. If you love everything from Hav and P, then pick this album up; otherwise, don't spend your hard-earned money on Blood Money.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00005N53K|5.0|First, before I start anything, I want to say that when I first heard about film, somewhat a year ago, I didn't think much of it. The only distinguishing thing about this movie was it's theme song, Lux Aeterna. Other than the chilling piece, I didn't know what to expect. <br /> <br />This movie is incredible. Not action/horror movie incredible, but emotionally. You see a portrait of the tattered lives of the four principle characters, their aspirations, their addiction to reaching their dreams, which in turn leads them down the road of drugs. Their lives move from alright to bad to worse in such a short timespan, you just can't help feeling sorry for them. You'd have to be emotionally void to not feel a thing for them. <br /> <br />Even the three acts are symbolic. The film starts in the Summer, which is the brightest part of the year, full of fun and laughter and unargueably the highest point for in the movie for each of them. Then, there is a transition to Fall, as the world starts to die. Leaves fall off branches, trees wither, and their lives are changed deeper into their self-dug pits. They still have the chance to turn back the clock, but they don't. Finally, there is Winter. Their lives have eroded, just as the earth itself. It's cold, and lonely and dark, and they can't go back. All of this shows in the last ten minutes, as their stories reach their horrible, yet inevitable climax. <br /> <br />\\"Where is Spring?\\" some might ask. Spring is a time of rebirth, of starting over. In this calamity, Spring has no place. There is no hushed voices. There is no happy ending. By the end, you just want to scream in sorrow and agony at the outcome. Yet for all the pain, nothing will change. <br /> <br />To me, this is one of the best, most dramatic movies out there, right up with Donnie Darko and Broken Saints for greatest movie of all time. Take heed, though. This movie is not for the casual viewer or the faint of heart and should be avoided if you can't stomach graphicallt intense scenes. For those who can, this is one movie you can never forget.
B00005JMAH|4.0|First, I must say that I have read all the books so far (at the urging of my college English professor - thanks, Mary), I've seen all the movies, and I long ago accepted the fact that you cannot expect a movie taken from a 700-page (approximation; don't really know how many pages there are) book to bear very much resemblance to the original. Get over it.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, this was my favourite of the Harry Potter movies. My favourite moment, by far, was Hermione giving Malfoy a well-deserved slug on the gob, but I've been waiting for it to happen; it doesn't do a lot for plot advancement, but it was satisfying.<br /><br />Harry has had it with his insufferable Muggle relatives and, after an unfortunate moment with his piggish aunt (in which he blimpifies her for remarks about his parents; I quite enjoyed that as well), takes off on his own with all his worldly goods. It doesn't take him long to consider that his timing might have been a bit off, as he sits in a creepy deserted park at midnight and wonders if that's really a vicious black dog across the road. Miraculously, just as he's about to find out, along comes the Night Bus (\\"for...the stranded witch or wizard\\"), a device I honestly don't remember being in the book but might have been; here, it works well as a way of getting Harry out of Muggle-Land and back in the magical realm.<br /><br />Delivered to the Leaky Cauldron, he hooks up with his friends Hermione and Ron and is put on the Hogwarts Express. It is there where we are first introduced to the Dementors, evil wraithlike beings assigned to find and retrieve Sirius Black, a convicted killer who has escaped from Azkaban Prison and is on the hunt for Harry, who also happens to be his godson. Perhaps because of his connection to Sirius, the Dementors home in on Harry, who is rescued by another new - but subsequently recurring - character, Remus Lupin, the new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher.<br /><br />They arrive at Hogwarts under the cloud of the Dementors' presence - the creatures are supposedly there for protection - and the year begins, with the requisite bad choices of magical beasties on Hagrid's part (as professor of Magical Beasts, he unerringly chooses some critter that is an overall menace to the greater part of the student body)and the consequent accident which seems to be a plot device. I enjoyed the hippogriff, and it proved important to the story; but it did take a while to get back to the hunt for Sirius Black. This line of the plot was aided by Ron's older twin brothers - underused, in my opinion; I enjoy every minute they are on screen - who, being the scamps they are, possess a marvelous map - nicked from the school custodian - that shows where everyone in the school confines might be found. They give the map to Harry, and from there the pace escalates toward the eventual confrontation with Sirius Black and other bad elements.<br /><br />I do have one pathetically minor quibble - the Whomping Willow must be able to move from place to place, as it seems to be a mile from where we last saw it in Movie #2. And this movie - aside from a mention here and there - is totally devoid of any manifestations of Lord Voldemort, which perhaps is not a bad thing.<br /><br />Overall I found this movie to be more watchable than the other two previous - it's both darker and lighter than the second one; there is more humour used here, but on the other hand, the whole Dementors thing is too intense for little kids, as is the werewolf segment - and, yes, the book is better. The book is ALWAYS going to be better. Your own imagination is a great and powerful tool. But as cinema, this is not bad at all.ogwarts under the cloud of the Dementors' presence - the creatures are supposedly there for protection - and the year begins, with the requisite bad choices of magical beasties on Hagrid's part (as professor of Magical Beasts, he unerringly chooses some critter that is an overall menace to the greater part of the student body)and the consequent accident which seems to be a plot device.

B000E1155E|4.0|I actually wasn't exposed to any of the hype about Arctic Monkeys. In fact, when I found out that they were going to be on Saturday Night Live, I was like, \\"Who the hell are they?\\" Well, the Sheffield foursome proved themselves and then some on their debut, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not.<br /><br />Actually, some of the most interesting moments refer not to the album, but their SNL appearance. Take the irresistible single \\"I Bet You Look Good On the Dancefloor\\", for example. On the album, lead singer Alex Turner says: \\"Stop making the eyes at me/I'm still making the eyes at you\\" but on the show, he said \\"Stop breaking the ties with me/I'm still breaking the ties with you\\". It's also interesting that before the final musical breakdown on \\"A Certain Romance\\", Alex pointed out to the audience and said, \\"That man just yawned.\\"<br /><br />But neither of those things take away from the overall greatness of those respective songs, or of the album as a whole. It's very hard to pick a favorite song out of the bunch, but \\"Riot Van\\", a humorous story about underage drinking, easily comes to mind (funny how the subject is acceptable when non-rappers talk about it, hmmm?). All arguments aside, one also can't afford to pass up \\"Red Light Indicates Doors Are Secured\\" or especially \\"Mardy Bum\\", because the infectious rhythms of both songs easily draw you in. The fifth track is also good, but I doubt it'll be released as a single because I think very few people will call up their local radio station to request \\"You Probably Couldn't See For the Lights But You Were Staring Straight At Me\\".<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give the album five stars is because in the middle of the otherwise good \\"Dancing Shoes\\", Alex says \\"Get on your dancing shoes/You sexy little swine\\", which I doubt will turn any women on.  I also don't know if the Monkeys will be doing as much touring right now, considering their bassist quit. At any rate, you can call them indie rock, garage rock, or whatever you want, but pick up Arctic Monkeys' album ad pop it into your stereo.<br /><br />Anthony Rupertge rock, or whatever you want, but pick up Arctic Monkeys' album ad pop it into your stereo. <br /> <br />Anthony Rupert

Corn everywhere right up to the edge of the roads, no ditch just corn. At first I thought this was impressive, America at its best....super production feeding the world. But then you start to get a little nagging in the back of your mind, \\"Man corn is everywhere...where does it all go?\\" <br /> <br />Micahael Pollen answers this question with several disturbing explainations: <br />1. You drink it by the boat load with every 20oz soda. <br />2. You eat it by the truck load with EVERYTHING. <br /> <br />This book will definetly screw you up...you will begin reading  labels and see the corn EVERY WHERE! <br />As a farm kid, hunter and parent, this book uncovers many answers to America's problems with food.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this disc.  I am waiting to get a little tired of it, but I've been waiting for 2 years now, and it hasn't happened.  It is tough to put into words a good description of this disc.  All the previous reviews did a much better job than I could ever hope to.  But give this disc a chance.  Don't listen to it once or twice and toss it aside.  While there aren't too many similarities with Tool, one that stands out is the complexity of the melodies, and it takes your mind some time to adjust and pick them up, but once it does, these melodies are indellibly planted in your mind.  Others have mentioned the diversity on this disc and they are absolutely correct.  What I find truly amazing about this disc are the slow, melodic tunes, specifically \\"Gravity\\" and \\"The Noose\\"  I actually made an iTunes playlist solely with these 2 songs, and I can listen to it for hours on end.  I can't explain, but these songs take you somewhere.   <br /> <br />I do not write very many reviews, unless it's something I wish the whole world could experience.  Try it out with a little patience, and you will be pleasantly surprised at what you didn't hear the first 5-10 times you listened.
B00004CZPF|5.0|This is a great DVD of two live performances of Mike Oldfield.  Side One is Tubular Bells II performed live at Edinburgh Castle.  Mike and his other musicians, and the orchestra all play pretty close to the original album of Tubular Bells II.  It's rather disappointing that the \\"Altered State\\" segment has to be a part of his most cherished album ever.  I cringe every time I here the album go into that annoying \\"caveman-like\\" tangent.  It follows \\"Tattoo\\" (with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards\\" on bagpipes) which is my favorite part of TB II.<br /><br />On Side Two of the DVD, Mike and his fellow performers play his 1998 album Tubular Bells III at the Horse Guards Parade in London.  If you already bought his DVD of \\"The Art in Heaven -Millennium Bell Concert\\", you will see many of his same performers are with him on this performance of Tubular Bells III.<br /><br />The sound quality is excellent on both sides of this DVD.  However, strangely enough, the video quality is better on the earlier TB II performance.  Not to say that TB III is bad, it's just not as good.<br /><br />Now, I know everybody who likes Mike Oldfield is criticizing him for re-recording and re-packaging Tubular Bells over and over, and over again these past 30 plus years.  But, if it wasn't for the 1992 release of Tubular Bells II, I would have probably just let myself forget all about him.  I really didn't follow Mike Oldfield's music much after Crises (1983) and The Killing Fields (1984).  I didn't care for how Mike Oldfield was doing less long played projects and started to perform pop sounding ditties with other singers.  Sometimes, you wouldn't know if you were listening to Mike Oldfield or ABBA.  \\"Family Man\\", \\"To France\\", \\"Moonlight Shadow\\", etc.  And when I saw \\"Discovery\\" (1984) and seen that it had more short pop songs with vocals, I just sort of gave up on Mike Oldfield, altogether.  So I think, TB II was a smart move for Mike Oldfield to re-introduce himself to the music world.  \\"Tubular Bells\\" (1973) was considered an innovative Progressive Rock achievement, and so TB II of 1992 had to compete with the modern day New Age music market.  I don't think TB III is any great disappointment, but I won't give it a miss either.  To see it performed live now actually makes me appreciate the album a lot more.<br /><br />And why shouldn't Mike Oldfield try and keep Tubular Bells alive?  When we go to see any singer or band in concert, we are usually not too concerned about hearing some of their new material.  We want to see and hear the hits, of course.  Especially from bands who's past is much more glorified than where they are today. However, I will say that \\"Tubular Bells 2003\\" is totally unnecessary.  Maybe if it were performed live, it would be considered more cherishable.  But, as a CD, I just don't need it.<br /><br />OK......Now for some bad news.  This is a PAL (Non-Region 1), DVD.  Not playable on DVD players in the USA (where we are NTSC).  This was a real big disappointment for me because I bought the Samsung DVD-HD950, that has been able to play every DVD that I've bought, even from Thailand, Japan, and England.  But, for the first time, my DVD player doesn't recognize this DVD.  So, the only way I can play this DVD is on my computer.  I only have a 19\\" monitor, but I do have my computer hooked up to my stereo, so I am enjoying a good picture (just smaller), and I do have fabulous sound quality.<br /><br />America needs to release this DVD in the USA.  \\"The Art in Heaven - Millennium Bell Concert\\" use to be my favorite Mike Oldfield DVD, but now I appreciate the performances of this DVD much more.<br /><br />\\"Exposed\\" on DVD is okay but the sound and picture isn't the greatest, but it is an earlier performance (1978), and \\"Live in Montreux\\" (1981) is just \\"okay\\" as well.<br /><br />Anyway, if you don't mind watching a concert performance on your computer, and if you are a Mike Oldfield fan, you should get this DVD.  Good luck finding it though, it's becoming pretty scarce.

B000069KE0|5.0|As good as their debut album was (the CTA album), here is Chicago at their early days best.  Whether you enjoy rock, jazz, or even classical, this album is strong in all respects.  From the the swinging opener \\"Movin' In\\", it moves through great rockers (\\"In the Country\\", \\"Make Me Smile\\", \\"25 or 6 to 4\\"), strong horn features (\\"Poem for the People\\", \\"Fancy Colors\\"), the preeminent prom song \\"Colour My World\\", a brief classical suite leading to the tender \\"Memories of Love\\", and closing with a 4-part social commentary suite that is once again very relevant. <br /> <br />For me, there is not one song that I dislike on this album.  This is Chicago at their early days best.  Front to back, this is my favorite Chicago album.

B0001611DI|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in theaters when I was a kid, and it still affects me the same today as it did back then.<br />If not for Romero, Horror movies would not be what they are today.<br />\\"Night of the Living Dead\\" was the true grounbreaker in horror,<br />but \\"Dawn\\" actually paved the way for today's horror flick.<br />It was the blood and guts and gore, and all in wonderful technicolor!!!!<br />True enough, there are cheesy looking things in the movie, like the blood in some scenes looks UNMISTAKENLY like red paint,<br />But if you focus on the STORY and not it's minor defects, It is one hell of a movie!<br /><br />To me there is nothing scarier than the walking dead! I also loved the idea (and still do today) of the survivors living upstairs in this HUGE mall,in very nice living quarters, and everything they could possibly want or need in the mall below, right at thier fingertips!<br />  then the irony that without a civilization of people, all these material things, and money are......useless !!<br /><br />\\"Dawn of the Dead\\" is just a great horror flick, with a GREAT storyline, and in my opinion, the acting was good, too.<br />The movie surely is not boring as some have suggested, in fact, quite the contrary. It held my attention RAPTLY for the entire film. I only wish they would have made a part 2 to this with the same characters!<br />It would have been nice to see what became of Fran and Peter,Fran's baby...They could have easily did a part 2, The possibilities were endless!<br />Perhaps the NEW version of \\"Dawn\\" they will make a part 2...I REALLY wasn't satisfied with THAT ending!!!<br />Anyway, I am getting way off track here, I give \\"Dawn\\" 10 stars!!!!
B00005JOSS|5.0|It's been a rough summer for movie going.  Normally I attend one or two films a week, but nothing in this summer's fare has really held my interest.  The exception is this film, \\"The Lake House\\".  Having seen trailers, I was puzzled by the plot, which needs to evolve over time.  It's complex to describe.  And when you are playing with \\"the past is the past, and the future is now....\\"  Well, you have to see the film.  Possibly, a mailbox plays a more central role in this film than it ever will in any other.<br /><br />The art direction, the low key acting, the total romance of \\"The Lake House\\" have made the film memorable to me, always in instant recall, just like \\"The Notebook\\".  Notwithstanding that I am not a Keanu Reeves fan, I believe that the coupling of Reeves with Bullock in this film was more than just a casting stunt.  I believe they have an immediate chemistry on film together that Reeves doesn't get with anyone else, and Sandra doesn't quite achieve with other partners.  With other leading men, notably Hugh Grant and Bill Pullman (her partner in one of the all time great romances, \\"While You Were Sleeping\\"), Bullock reverts to romantic comedy.  Here, the romance is in earnest, her feelings more real than sparkly;  the message is about relationships, and the humanity involved in maintaining them.<br /><br />An excellent, quiet film...not to be missed!

The description of the actions are disspassionate and professionsla, rather like the author himself. <br /> <br />The story ends on the western front in 1945, where the collapse of the regime is covered from a front line perspective with the inevitable pains of a well oiled machine grinding to a halt. <br /> <br />This is a story of tactics on the front line, and leaves the larger strategic perspective to others. <br /> <br />If you play strategy games such as \\"Panzers\\" the tactics discussed here will give further insight into the gameplay

B000784WMW|5.0|No film maker has ever been able to successfully bring Jane Eyre to the screen.  Thank god for the BBC!  The quality of this version surpasses all others and is very successful.  Timothy Dalton is a great Mr. Rochester and Zelah Clarke is a terrific Jane Eyre.  Other actors have done a good job, but it seemed that compressing the story and making it fit a 2 hour slot caused the story to be incomprehensible and lessened the emotional impact of the story.  I was very pleased when the BBC's Jane Eyre was put on DVD and ordered it from Amazon.com as soon as it was released.  I bought the video version earlier.  The story is very moving and faithful in the best way to the book.

The key to the movie's success is that it is based on a great premise. The team that produced this movie took that and did everything right with casting, sets, costume, soundtrack. The result is the best British period drama ever produced, not excluding A & E's Pride & Prejudice. To date I've purchased 7 copies of this movie. What more can I say?
B000BTC5LW|4.0|Pay no attention to those who fault the audio in the PULSE DVD.  In my full-blown 5.1 home-theater system, the audio is phenomenal (you even have two audio qualities to select from). The DVD audio is defnitely superior to the CD audio; enough said about the audio.  Now, the criticism of the video is justified--grainy and pixelated on my 50\\" plasma when the camera pans/zooms out to the full stage and merely okay when the camera zooms in on individual band members.  There's do doubt the light show is over-the-top, but I'm slightly sad the video is sub-par (yes, Gilmour says he made a mistake by not taping on film).  The Eagle Hell Freezes Over DVD from the same Vintage is better.  If the video were as good as the recent U2 DVD concert releases, this PULSE DVD might have been one of greatest of all time.  ...Now, onto the content of the DVD.  Many have already written extensively about most of the DVD.  But for me, the surprise performance is \\"Sorrow.\\"  The band rocks THE hardest on this track.  Nick Mason behind the drum kit looks like he actually breaks a sweat near the end of the track, whereas he's mostly passive through most of the other songs.  Rick Wright also moves around his his keyboards more than other songs, and Gilmour rips a mean guitar on this one.  I've liked this track for years on the PULSE CD, but the visuals behind it give it much more heft.  This track is absolutely fantastic.

1400034779|3.0|This novel--to the extent that it is a novel rather than a collection of short stories--certainly is different, due almost entirely to the detective/mystery genre in its third world setting. The change is refreshing, offering mild intellectual stimulation to the reader through an introduction to Botswana's language, culture, geography, and wildlife. These are introduced in such a way as to be memorable, so it's a more pleasant way to develop an interest in the landlocked country than reading an encyclopedia entry.<br /><br />However, I found the novel disappointing. For each little challenge that came to the Lady Detective, Mma Romatsuwe, none was much more than a question-and-answer for her. She only had to think up a solution to the problem. Unfortunately, I realized the solution to her most difficult challenge as soon as I saw the problem.<br /><br />I do not feel inspired to read any further in the series.

B000002H97|3.0|This was Metallica's smash album, although they alienated some long time fans by toning their sound down to the mainstream quite significantly.  Although they still manage to maintain an edge overall, the thrash sound is largely gone.  It is clear that many of these songs were written to be radio accessible, which seemed a shame that Metallica sort of abandoned their craft.   <br /> <br />The mainstream public ate this release up though and there was a new rash of Metallica fans all of a sudden.  Truth be told, \\"Enter Sandman,\\" \\"Sad But True,\\" \\"Unforgiven,\\" and \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" may be more enjoyable than anything on \\"And Justice for All,\\" despite its much better overall sound.  Still, I feel that the rest of the material here demonstrates Metallica taking a step in the wrong direction, though.   <br /> <br />I do recommend this album to fans of the band, since this is their biggest seller, but longtime fans who loved Metallica's variety of trash metal may be disappointed.  While this is too complex an album to be labeled \\"sell-out,\\" there seems some truth to that label, as the black album represents style triumphing over substance and gives the feeling that \\"you too can now be a Metallica fan.\\"
B0009SOFFY|5.0|. . . even if you wanted to; but if you're a fan of pure rock I can't imagine you'd want this wasted soundscape to ever end. The only complaint one could make about _fun house_ is that it ends; this is about the best criticism one could make of an album, as I'm sure you would agree.

B000002HMH|2.0|As a long time fan of the 80's Metallica, this was a horrible disappointment to me after waiting so long for some new material from the guys.  Not only has all the thrash been stripped away, but the rock has shades of alternative music throughout.   <br /> <br />Although \\"Ain't My Bitch\\" starts out more or less on the right track, the album soon becomes boring, because while the soloing, time changes, and little interludes have mostly disappeared from the songs, they are still mighty long.  Metallica originally wrote long songs so as to properly let them breathe, but these alterna-metal snore-fests would be better if they were short.   <br /> <br />For what it's worth, the public seemed to love this and there was suddenly a new generation of Metallica fans, yet again.  It seems that Metallica knew exactly what they were doing by taking time off and then coming out with a different sound that kept them in the mainstream.  That doesn't make me enjoy \\"Load\\" any more, though.

B000000OQF|5.0|Plain and simple--this is one of the best rock albums (and debuts) of all time.  The rock magazines touted GNR as stars before \\"Appetite\\" even hit the shelves, even though it took over a year after the album's release for that to become reality.  When it did hit, GNR were bigger than anyone could have dreamed, but their incredible first album justified it. <br /> <br />The sound was clearly Aerosmith-derived with a slightly punk edge, but it was extremely fresh, brilliantly written, and it seemed the future of rock was in front of us.  Axl's aggression was the edge that they needed to put them over the top somehow.  Almost every song is a highlight (only filler is arguably \\"Anything Goes\\") and I can't say enough about this wonderful breakthrough album.  Sadly, they never came close to reaching this level of achievement again.
B000093BDX|2.0|There are a lot of Good Songs Here, You already know that, everyone knows most of these Tunes, but any REAL Beach Boys Fan can see why this Set is Lacking...Mike Love is overrepresented here, from \\"Rock and Roll Music\\" to \\"Kokomo\\" (a Truly DREADFUL Song), sure those were Big Hits, but NOT Best; This Collection is a cynical Cash-Grabbing attempt to squeeze Money out of the most casual Beach Boys Fan, and the mastering is LOUD and Compressed...if You want a Great Beach Boys CD, try to Find \\"Beach Boys Greatest\\", a 25 Song Import from Japan (1998), that CD has more Brian Wilson Cuts, such as the Sublime \\"Surf's Up\\",\\" Sail on Sailor\\", and \\"Caroline No\\" that are missing here.
B00005JP7M|3.0|Woody Allen is no dummy when it comes to filmmaking; he knows the story he wants to tell and he understands the value of casting the right person in the right part. And his writing style is unique to say the least, combining humor, drama, and philosophical observations (listening to him ramble is akin to reading the psychoanalytic writings of Jacques Lacan). None of these elements are lost in \\"Scoop,\\" his second film to star Scarlett Johansson and to be filmed in London. However, the fact that all the elements are there is also part of the problem. Yes, \\"Scoop\\" is funny, analytic, mysterious, and even supernatural (which seems to be a popular plot device in a lot of Allen's movies). But it's also a long-winded and pretentious film, almost as if it were made solely for the director's enjoyment.    It's difficult for me to say that because Allen has made a number of well crafted films, including \\"Love and Death\\" and last year's \\"Match Point.\\" But I sometimes wonder if his capacity for quality entertainment always has to include such a mishmash of different storytelling methods. \\"Scoop\\" mixes several genres that don't ordinarily get mixed, and the result was a pretty confused film about romance, mystery, and murder. Johansson stars as Sondra Pransky, an American college student who hopes to become a full time journalist. While staying with a family friend in London, she attends a magic show hosted by Sid Waterman, known on stage as Splendini (Woody Allen). She's asked to volunteer on stage by stepping into a large box (which will supposedly make her disappear).     Upon entering the box, the ghost of former newspaper reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) materializes. Here enters the supernatural side of the story: he's gotten a major scoop from beyond the grave, and rather than let it go, he decides that a living reporter should investigate. He has reason to believe that England's most notorious serial killer since Jack the Ripper--the Tarot Card Killer--may actually bePeter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), a well known member of the British upper class. Unfortunately, Strombel has no way to prove this beyond a shadow of a doubt. He can only rely on Sondra, a young woman who he feels has what it takes to get to the bottom of things.    After this encounter, she and Sid form a dysfunctional partnership by posing as father and daughter. Here enters the comedic side of the story: they go through a series of circumstances that exploit their friendly yet problematic relationship. Yes, the fact that they're completely mismatched makes for some humorous moments. Allen is known for playing the neurotic New Yorker, and for \\"Scoop\\" he lays that personality on thick. Johansson plays an overly ambitious journalist, one whose pluckiness leaves her unable to understand why certain words come out of Sid's mouth. The two couldn't be anything less alike, and in that sense, their interactions work. But I still wanted something more, something that wasn't overshadowed by immature bickering. After a while, it became exhausting to listen to. Maybe it would have been better if Allen hadn't actually been in the film; his comedic persona didn't mesh with the story he was trying to tell.    By the time Sondra and Lyman actually meet, Sid seems even more out of place than he already was. For a man posing as a friend to the British elite, he can't seem to get out of the magician mode of thinking; he always performs an effective yet socially unacceptable card trick whenever he's with a large group of people. He uses his on-stage routines to help him get through a conversation, rambling on and on about how each person is terrific, lovely, and a credit to his or her race (he also says, \\"And I say that with all due respect,\\" quite often, even when he's insulting someone). It's all undeniably Woody Allen material, which is funny some of the time, inappropriate at others. I won't go so far as to say that his humor completely stalls the film, but it does make it more difficult to get into the story.    That's a shame because the more interesting moments occur from the middle of the film onward. Lyman takes an immediate liking to this young American girl (who he believes is named Jade), and the whirlwind romance inevitably begins. But while Sondra knows that her feelings can't get in the way of her story, she's gradually finding it more and more difficult to believe Lyman is the Tarot Card Killer. This is in spite of the fact that the murders are continuing, the timings of which coincide with his mysterious absences. However, Sondra doesn't completely give in; she and Sid do quite a bit of snooping as the film progresses, gathering plenty of clues that could expose Lyman as a murderer. The problem is that every shred of evidence they have is purely circumstantial. If they want to accuse a powerful and famous man of unspeakable crimes, they need to be absolutely sure of themselves.    It eventually becomes a question of what to believe. Is Lyman really the Tarot Card Killer? Are Strombel's instincts about this case dead wrong (pun definitely intended)? Is the evidence Sondra collected going to be enough to convince the authorities? Does the evidence even lead to proof of guilt, or is it all just a series of coincidences? This is the one aspect of the film that actually worked for me; the mysterious elements are quite fascinating, especially since we're given the opportunity to solve the mystery along with Sondra and Sid. But I would have enjoyed this movie much more if it knew what it wanted to be. I think I would have preferred it be a straight murder mystery. Allen's esoteric humor didn't do much to enliven the story, nor did the supernatural elements.     Then again, these are trademark components to a Woody Allen screenplay, and when you follow a formula for so long, change is difficult to accept. I suppose devoted fans will get their money's worth from \\"Scoop,\\" but I shouldn't think anyone else would. It's simply not one of his better movies. Don't get too upset with me; much like Sid Waterman, I say that with all due respect.
B000EGDB10|4.0|Despite the disc I received(with 2 scratches on the back)I think this is the best of the series that lauched Tom Cruise career(which had other sucesses).I'm a bit dissapointed about this Special Edition.No making off are in the disc only some featurettes focusing Tom Cruise and the story of Mission Impossible in the last 40 years since it's first TV series.Just a few trailers and tears focusing mostly on MIF 3.I really wanted to see the rolling of the film and how the stunts and FX were created(ILM,Blue screen shots and at).<br /><br />Anyway a very entertaining film that will make u watch many times.
B00004ST9Q|5.0|The picture is attractive, and gorgeous. The dancing is exciting. It made me dance while watching this DVD. The sound is good. All of Whitney's songs I love are here, from the lovely and romantic \\"Saving all my love for you\\" to the upbeat, and engaging \\"How will I know\\".  <br /> <br />I love it so much that I bought a copy from the local music store right after renting it.  <br /> <br />The best thing about this disc is you can TURN ON the LYRICS. This enables me to SING ALONG.  <br /> <br />I have been singing with it since then. I wish all the music DVDs allow you to toggle on the lyrics. It's definitely WORTH BUYING.
0060853964|4.0|Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witch, is an excellent choice of reading for anyone with an interest in armageddon, eschatology, religion, sociology, psychology, or human nature in general.  Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett take an unflinching look, through the eyes of Aziraphale and Crowley, at humanity in all it's glory.<br /><br />Aziraphale, the good-natured angel, and Crowley, the Bentley-driving demon, have served their respective masters since the dawn of time, all the while becoming more accustomed to living amongst humans.  A special camaraderie has formed between the two, even though they play for different sides.  They've each become attached to life on Earth.  Now they must work together to find the Antichrist, before all hell breaks loose-literally.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed the Sandman comics by Neil Gaiman may want to take a look at this book.

B0000CAQ26|4.0|I like Pink. I like her music, and her as a person. She's pop-rock, and Try This shows off every aspect of her music. She writes lyrics as good as the rest of the music, and this album shows that well. My problem is that she goes out of her rock stage for part of the album, which are my least favorite songs. They are good, but they're placed at odd points in the album. It has four fast-paced songs, then it goes to Catch me While I'm Sleeping, an extremely slow song, to Waiting for love, another slow song, to Save my Life, a faster song. I would've put Catch Me after Waiting for Love, but before Save my Life. <br /> <br /> <br />Trouble: 8.5/10 Great song, great single, and the best song to start off the CD. <br />God is a DJ: 8/10 Good, not great. Good dance track though. <br />Last to Know: 9.5/10 You want angry? You got angry. <br />Oh my God: 9/10 Fun song, good guitars. <br />Catch me While I'm Sleeping: 5/10 Ugh. It's slow, and not even a good slow song. <br />Waiting for Love: 10/10 Awesome. Sounds like a song Suzanne Vega would do. <br />Save my Life: 8.5/10 Happy-sounding song, and another dance song. <br />Try Too Hard: 7.5/10 Has potential, but fails to get it. <br />Humble Neighborhoods: 9/10 Great, and fun to sing along to. <br />Walk Away: 9/10 Awesome song, but isn't as catchy as some others on here. <br />Unwind: 9.5/10 The trumpets make the song. <br />Love Song: 3/10 Compared to Catch me, Catch me is a 9/10. Only reason to listen to it is... <br />Hooker (hidden track): 10/10 Second-best song, and especially a better angry song than Last to Know. <br /> <br />Overall, a buy. Only two songs are weak, but they're WEAK. Nothing holding them up. But if you like the singles, get it. If you like any of Pink's other material, buy it.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Although Pearl Jam never really left the rock scene, their several previous albums--Riot Act, Binaural, Yield, and No Code--were more experimental than their earlier releases and generally un-digetible for a general audience (the big exception is the excellent semi-acoustic set, \\"Live at Benaroya Hall\\").  While these albums yielded some of their best songs (\\"Thin Air,\\" \\"Red Mosquito,\\" \\"Who We Are,\\" \\"Can't Keep,\\" \\"Present Tense,\\" \\"I Am Mine,\\" and \\"Light Years,\\" to name a few), overall each album was at best a hit-and-miss affair.  With the eponymous new release, it's as if Pearl Jam called a band huddle and said to each other, \\"We've shown everybody that we're creative, let's show them now that we still rock!\\" <br /> <br />And that's exactly what they've done with \\"Pearl Jam.\\"  The albums starts on an energetic note with \\"Life Wasted,\\" and the energy doesn't let up until track 6.  While everybody surely knows the principal singles (\\"Life Wasted\\" and \\"World Wide Suicide\\"), even the B-sides (for now, as they could easily release these songs as singles, and perhaps already have without my knowing) such as \\"Come Back,\\" \\"Inside Job,\\" \\"Army Reserve,\\" \\"Unemployable,\\" and \\"Marker in the Sand,\\" are on par with the best songs released by almost any other band on the scene nowadays. <br /> <br />And, what's more, they're on par with the best songs from \\"Ten.\\"  For several years it seemed that Pearl Jam had shot themselves in the foot with their brilliant debut album--in that it was impossible to match--but I have to say that it seems they finally have a worthy follow-up.  In some senses, I like this album more, since it combines the smoothness of \\"Ten\\" with the rawness of \\"Vs.\\" <br /> <br />Pearl Jam is finally back!  Give this disc a listen and hear for yourself!
B00005JO9J|5.0|I started late on Grey's Anatomy starting off on a few episodes of season two.  I watched season one and loved it even more.  I really enjoy the storylines with the point of view directed on the interns and their struggles in the hospital and in their personal lives.  The characters are diverse and there is something to love about each of them. <br /> <br />If you like a good drama with surprises and a little humor thrown in here and there, you'll love this show!
B000005JA8|5.0|Besides the Howlin' Wolf voice (more soulfully done by Van Vliet here, I dare say!), Trout Mask Replica marks an absolute break from all ties to popular, classical, and jazz music.  Nothing like it, ever, anywhere.  Beefheart directs his childlike mania to creating a new anti-rhythym, an atonal beat which doesn't even pander to the still markedly African and well-timed drum thrashing of Coleman's watershed Free Jazz. <br /> <br />Moonlight On Vermont is an exorcism of your soul in silver and gray silhouette.  My Human Gets Me Blues is the new world philosophy, towering over modern academia.  Old Fart at Play is the most sentimental masterwork since Chaplin's City Lights. <br /> <br />Oh, yeah, and if Rock ever produced a Beethoven, it was Beefheart.  Notice the similarity in names?  It's no coincidence. <br /> <br />Buy this.  Buy it now.  It'll give you that old time religion.

A complete non-sequitur, stream of consciousness mess, best describes this book.  Why this publication came so highly acclaimed I will never know.  Do yourself a favor........if you feel inclined to give it a read, go to your local library.  The paper and ink has already been wasted, don't waste your money too.  A better title would be, \\"The Tao of Poop\\".

B00005JOQS|2.0|Superman in the 21st century just doesnt work.  <br /> <br />Most of the film is based on a cheezy romance. Mrs Lane struts around for the first half, selfishly peeved about being dumped \\"why the world doesn't need superman\\", but our pig-tailed greesy superhero had a superexcuse. And eventually he weezles his way back into her heart, 'picks her up' literally. It seems superman, in his endeavour to get a superkiss, doesnt have supermorals about breaking up a family. <br />Meanwhile Mrs Lane doesnt know who the father of her son is. <br />Welcome to the 21st century Superman saga.  <br /> <br />In that tradition, I would've liked to see superman have a go at the middle east crisis. A much more fun prospect, than a one dimensional bad guy on the hunt for the next big Kryptonite.  <br /> <br />Hopefully in the next sequel, Superman's son turns bad from all the psycholoical damage, and we will see our green guy Yoda make a celebrity appearance as the ultimate kryptonite hero.!?..... in the tradition of destroying great classic comic stories.  <br />
B00005JOML|3.0|I'm reading through the other reviews and find the commentary intersting.  Most complaints are that there is not enough action and way too much talk...   <br /> <br />Personally, I thought there was plenty of action but didn't find the characters developed enough.  The relationships seemed very flat and unbelievable to me.  Much of the violence and action was supposedly caused by these relationships, jealousy, etc. <br /> <br />Bottomline: I didn't find a balance between Cause (relationships) and Effect (action).  The Effect was there, the Cause wasn't.

0061015725|5.0|Just as \\"Eaters of the Dead\\" is more fantasy than sci-fi, \\"Prey\\" is almost part mystery.  Crichton lays out the clues for his readers and allows them to match wits with his protagonist, Jack Forman.  I did figure out some of the outcome long before Jack did, but the novel was still incredibly fast-paced and engrossing.  Unlike some of Crichton's other novels, which portrayed situations I do not see myself falling into, \\"Prey\\" was downright frightening.  Highly recommended.
B0002O7XWC|3.0|I must say, this movie was interesting in how it carried itself. It reflected a nice idea of how the sub-culture of freedom was mashed with the majority of close-minded fools. It had some of the same ideals I tend to have about the mixing of beliefs. <br /> <br />The movie gave you plenty of images of how Wyatt and Billy's life could be. Buying their own farmland, living on a commune, or even catering to the majority and living in an all prejudice town. It even talks about the idea of perfect communism (Which is unachievable by man) in Jack Nickolson's UFO speech. You look at the lifestyles of the commune and the two bikers and see how redneck bigotism treats this change from the socially acceptable. There are plenty of subtle messages in this movie that you would have to think about to understand. <br />      <br />I bet almost anyone would tell you that Jack Nickolson portrayed George Hanson better than any being on earth. That's because it's true. Unless you are the redneck bigot as explained above, you can't help, but like George. Sure, he may be a drunkard, but he is the embodiment of activism for freedom and sanity in this world. He just wants everyone to get along. He also shows that even someone from the south does have common sense. This is perfect, considering many pre-judgements upon southern people. You just wish he didn't have to die, but because of how pro-freedom minds were treated, it was inevitable. <br />      <br />Although this movie has wonderful ideas and promotes a humanitarian view, it doesn't quite always get the ideas down well. I found the movie to be very plain in the beginning, because I found that to be one of the most boring drug runs I've ever seen on movie. I might have missed something with the planes going over the car, but that seemed like a waste of time to me. It trails you off until you reach the farm and start to see some ideas grow. Another part was Mardi Gras. I felt like that man could have done anything better than he did.It wasn't the drugs that bothered me. It was how they enacted self-demoralization, which I felt wasn't really important to what the movie was trying to say. I was so excited for Mardi Gras and a big let-down fell over me when I saw it. The prostitutes were fun, the idea of going out was amazing, and BAM! I already get proselytized enough. If these things were out of the movie, I would have enjoyed it more. <br />      <br />The ending couldn't have been more true. This was really the way it had to be, considering the time-frame they want to cover. It had all the things to leave you feeling cold inside. That's the way a strong tragedy ends. This ending was so good, it was covered by the Venture Brothers in the last episode of the first season where the two boys die. <br />      <br />To head onto the book, I found it almost pointless. It just seemed like a bunch of vanity rolled into ready made bong material. The book could have been perfect if it just had explained all the signs in the movie. No one cares about Fonda picking his nose. Unless you want to, of course. <br />      <br />The biggest failure of this movie is how corporate capitalism rips off the public with it's \\"songtrack\\". People want to watch the movie and if they like the music, listen to the full version soundtrack. If you want to buy this, get the non-special edition. <br />      <br />Overall it was worth watching and maybe more of a rentable than a buyable.
B000FSME1A|3.0|I agree.  This is hardly \\"complete\\".  Everyone who loves this film, also loves Hearts of Darkness.  I know a couple of people who even like the doc better than the film itself.  Regarding the aspect ratio issue:  I read quite a few years ago, when they released Apocalypse Now with the new aspect ratio on LaserDisc, it was because the cinematographer and Coppola himself preferred it.  Of course all the clips from the film in \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" are still in the original theatrical aspect ratio of 2:35:1.  I agree that it should be released in the original format.  For us movie geeks it would be nice to have both aspect ratios on the same disc.  But oh well.  We hardly ever get what we want.  Maybe Peter Jackson should look into a career change and produce the DVD content for all great films, so no one is ever disappointed like this again. (In regards to the Lord of the Rings DVDs being the best of all time, not to be too modest here.)
0441009425|1.0|I struggled through a few hundred pages of this beast about six months ago, then gave up in frustration.  I tried again this week, and concluded that giving up was the right answer.   <br /> <br />What I read of this does show a lot of promise.  The settings are interesting, the technological milieu challenging and not obviously preposterous, and it does seem like something interesting is going on.  And the individual story lines are presented in clear enough prose. <br /> <br />But in my opinion there are two fatal flaws.  First, the author weaves even a single chapter from chunks of multiple story lines separated by decades and light years, each chunk just a few pages long and with minimal cues which story we are in - e.g. you have to remember that the story of Ana Khouri is 28 (?) years earlier than the excavation that started the book, every few pages when he switches on you. This gets really tiresome, especially if you put the book down overnight.  Second, he seems to have missed the school of literary SF in which exposition of key information is primarily presented in forward sequence in a book - he reverts to the old \\"immersion\\" (or \\"sink-or-swim\\") style of just throwing around dozens of unexplained terms and proper names and it's your problem if you can't put the picture together in your head when they are eventually either explained or used in a more informative context (if ever).  All of these \\"unresolved forward references\\" make reading the book almost as much work as writing it must have been.  <br /> <br />These problems in combination are devastating. I can't follow the book well enough to care about what's going to happen, and I don't find a reason to trust the writer to pull this pile together well enough to pay for the investment of my time. <br /> <br />Maybe, if you are willing and able to make reading this book your main job for a while, and work at it (e.g. keep notes to help sort out the storylines), this might turn out to be an interesting book.  But really, it should be re-written with a lot more consideration for the reader.
B00001OH7P|5.0|I feel that this particular album by David Bowie, would have to be his finest.  Not only can he combine silly lyrics and a strange idea into a great album, but he does it great.  Some Favorites would be Starman, Ziggy Stardust, Five Years, Soul Love, and Sufferagette City.  This is Bowie in his prime people, so understand that this is a great buy for any fan of Rock or Pop.<br /><br />~^*Sam^*~
B000F7CMRM|1.0|Boring and bad sound. This is a largly conversational movie. I had to keep fiddling with the DVD remote to hear the whispering or low voice sequences then again to turn it down during the blaring music non-dialogue \\"action\\" scenes. Also I found the subtitles totally annoying. I'd preferred to listen to most of it instead while puttering around the house since there was not that much in this movie that really needed to be seen to be understood. <br /> <br />It did, however, give a little bit of insight into Arab life, their rulers and the motivation of various factors and factions working against them. Might have worked far better as a documentary, though.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|before i begin, i would just like to say that i gave this movie five stars, but on a scale fo 1-5 ths is a 135 at least!!  <br /> <br />ok, i came into thise movie not really knowing what to expect, i was watching it based on a friend's tip. but by the time the chandalier took me back to 1860, i was hooked. the sets, costumes, and effects were incredable, and were not overly done as everyone else seemed to think. many said that the look of the film was too overexaagerated, but i completely disagree. for a movie like this it was perfect.  <br /> <br />as for the actors, which everyone seemed to dislike. the acting was solid and the singing was actually quite good, i had heard some nasty review on this site of the leads' voices. but honostly emmy rossum was just as good, if not better than sarah brightman, and gerard butler may not have been ideal, but he was still quite acceptable and brought a lot of emotion adn power to his songs. michael crawford wasn't necesarily better, just, as one other reviewer stated, \\"different.\\" honostly their version of phantom of the opera sounds very good and their version of point of no return is increadible, much better than crawford and brightman's rendition.  <br /> <br />all in all, this has to be one of the best movies i've EVER seen, and i can't see how anyone disliked it. these actors certainly are not the originals who made the characters famous, but they are still vrey talented and impressive, just enter the film with an OPEN mind, and you can't go wrong!! <br />

B00005LOLD|4.0|While cross-ethnic marriage is of course accepted today, such was not the case when this movie was filmed.  This one, of course, deals with marriages between US GIs and Japanese girls during early 1950s occupied Japan.  The US Army was (according to the film) aggressively discouraging such marriages, and it was difficult or impossible for the GIs to bring their brides back to the States.  This is the backdrop for this sensitive and well-made film.<br /><br />Brando plays the role of an American hot-shot jet pilot who is temporarily transferred from the Korean battle front to occupied Japan.  He and a close friend both meet and fall in love with splendid Japanese ladies, and therein lies a touching and tragic storyline.  No spoilers here.<br /><br />What is it about Brando that caused him to repeatedly be cast in roles that required him to assume awful accents of one kind or another?  (Mutiny on the Bounty, The Young Lions, and this one.)  Brando utterly fails to pull off the Southern accent of his role, and they would have done better to dispense with it altogether.  This is why I deprive this one of the fifth star--the accent really, really degrades the film.  And I am a big Brando fan.<br /><br />Nevertheless, \\"Sayonara\\" is a don't-miss film, and even hard-boiled viewers will not fail to be touched by this sensitive period-piece film.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|FIRST IMPRESSIONS -- If one were to imagine a happy ending where 'Belle' from 'BEAUTY & THE BEAST' became a beast in the end rather than the beast becoming a Prince, one can get an idea of what Shrek is all about. <br />      <br /> <br />ALOT IS GOING ON, BUT IT IS ALL FUN & HOLDS OUR INTEREST --  <br /> <br />As with \\"Ice Age,\\" I found myself watching and re-watching this new, animated epic which has quickly become a favorite of our family -- children and adults alike. For some reason, my wife thought this film might be too \\"mature\\" for our youngest [age 5] to enjoy appropriately, but like \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\", the adult jokes go over the toddlers' heads without so much as an expectant look. Part of what makes this film so good is the way it lampoons the usual cliches. Somehow in the process, Shrek seems to avoid those overdone, tired cliches by suspending our disbelief and redefining the genre in a way we may not have expected [for a change] and moving the power of the story up a notch, keeping pace with the soaring technologies and budgets now available to bring these epics to us, the audience.  <br /> <br />SHREK IS A FILM THAT WORKS & IS IDEAL FOR FAMILY TOGETHER TIME  <br /> <br />Also like \\"Ice Age\\", the plot really moves cleanly and concisely and does not get caught up in song. Disney can make the songs work for the plot, but no other studio could have us humming \\"The Bare Necessities\\" 35 years after it was released in \\"The Jungle Book\\". In Shrek, the ending is satisfying, although it would be much like \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" ending with Belle becoming a beast too (courtesy of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the K is Dreamworks SKG)!  <br /> <br />THE DVD & SPECIAL FEATURES --  <br /> <br />The DVD played wonderfully and had hours of features that the kids enjoyed, with Eddie Murphy's character Donkey imploring humorously, \\"PICK ME\\"! SHREK is a real winner.  <br />
B000GYI32M|3.0|December 1, 2006 Addition:  I wanted to add a note responding to my own question in my original headline:  Can it rebound in Season Four?  The great news is:  Yes!  If there were an Emmy given for \\"The Comeback Show of the Year,\\" THE O.C. after its first five episodes would have to be a leading candidate.  I will be honest:  I initially tuned in just to verify that THE O.C. in its 4th season was as bad as it was in its 3rd.  I was going to watch two or three episodes and then give up on it.  The great news is that it has completely returned to form and is now as good as it has been since it first started.  This was not expected!  The main reason is has been so good has been that it has gotten back to enjoying the characters, instead of introducing a string of unlikable ones that no one can stand.  So far this season, not a single irritating new character!  I was afraid that they would make Caitlin into the new Marissa, but so far she hasn't been too bad.  The biggest surprise has to be Taylor.  I assumed that she would no longer be a part of the show this season, but they not only have brought her back, they've made her vastly more intersting and sympathetic than I would ever have imagined.  She is actually now a character I like.  Who'd a thunk it?  Right now the show is as strong as it was in Season One.  One of the best turnarounds I've ever seen a show make.<br /><br />The third season of THE OC was an almost unbelievable come down from the first two fun seasons.  The things that made people enjoy the show the first two seasons were largely pushed to the side, while the more irritating features of the first two seasons were brought to the fore and made the center of the show.  On several occasions both I and my good friend who also watches the show debated about whether we were going to stop watching it.  There is a point where the displeasure is watching the show threatened to overwhelm any pleasures it brought.  Then, after a season of one unpleasantness after another, the show ended on a shocker.  Normally one would require a Spoiler warning for this, but unfortunately Mischa Barton herself spoiled the ending by announcing on national TV a few days before the season finale that her character was going to die on the show.  Why she did this has been debated.  Was she trying to hurt the show?  Was she just being stupid?  Whatever the reason, what would have been one of the most shocking endings in recent TV history was common knowledge even before it aired.<br /><br />What went wrong in Season Three?  Well, the same things that went wrong in Seasons 1 and 2 but that played a smaller role each year:  the introduction of exceedingly unpleasant and irritating characters who dominate the course of the show's narrative.  In Season One this was mainly restricted to Oliver, one of the worst characters I've ever seen in a TV show.  My guess is that the show's creative team misinterpreted what made the show popular in Season One.  Instead of the fun alchemy between the younger members of the cast along with the narratives centering on the adult cast members--which I think was about 99% of the reason people liked the show--they imagined that the chaos injected into the show by Oliver's character was what people loved about it.  My own belief is that people liked the show DESPITE Oliver and the chaos he created, not because of him.  I'm sure the show's producers imagined that Oliver was a character that viewers loved to hate, instead of merely hating him, which was the actual case.  So, in Season Two, the show's producers and writers gave even more characters that we merely hated (instead of loved to hate), the unlikable Alex (who was unlikable not because she became Marissa's lover but because she was merely unlikable) and Trey, Ryan's older brother.<br /><br />Because the producer's misunderstood what people were liking about the show--people liked the main characters, not the situations generated by the minor, intensely unlikablecharacters who upset the show's chemistry--they flooded the third season with terrible characters.  It started early on in the rehab facility, where we were introduced to the duplicitous Charlotte, a role on which they wasted the wonderful Jeri Ryan.  Luckily, Charlotte didn't stay on the show very long, though she was extremely unpleasant while she did.  Also early in the season was the terrible Dean Jack Hess, another thoroughly unlikable and wildly implausible character who seemed to have a personal vendetta against Ryan and Marissa.  He too disappeared fairly early on.  But by then we had been introduced to Johnny, a semi-professional surfer at the public school Marissa was forced to attend after she was kicked out of her private school (her dismissal being merely one more of a host of unbelievable developments).  Now, in Johnny's defense, he was not for the most part a terrible character.  But his crush on Marissa and Marissa's ongoing inability to do the commonsense things to protect her relationship with Ryan was part and parcel of the stupidity on the part of all the major characters that almost caused the show to unravel.  But even with all these irritating characters, the show's producers weren't done.  Taylor Townshend was not really a character but a cartoon of a character, someone determined to take over as the school's social leader with the departure of Marissa and as Seth's girlfriend.  Now, I will concede that she did become less unlikable as the season went on, and I liked that the show tried to turn her from a bad to a good character.  But throughout she remained intensely annoying.  There were numerous other unpleasant characters, but the crown for the title of King of the annoying characters of the third season clearly belongs to Vollchek, Johnny's surfing competitor, petty thug, briefly Marissa's lover, and all around annoying guy.  He is also the guy who causes Marissa's death.  While he doesn't come up to the annoying level of Oliver, he is close.<br /><br />As a result of this endless parade of unlikable characters and stupid behavior on the part of the main characters (except Summer, who seems to be the only character immune to occasional idiocy--her aside, there were numerous occasions when you wanted to smack all of the major characters aside the head and yell, \\"Will you get a grip!\\"), fan discontent grew and grew and ratings of the show fell precipitously.  After the end of the season there were rumors that FOX was so displeased with the show that they considered canceling it.  In the end, they agreed to bring it back for 16 episodes, starting it much later in the season's schedule and running it without repeats, with the possibility of adding additional episodes if the ratings recover and if it turns out that people watch the show with Marissa off the show.  It may well turn out, however, that the terrible Season Three was the beginning of the end for THE OC.<br /><br />My central complaint with the show--even more than the parade of awful guest characters--is that the show more and more abandoned what made the show fun in the first two seasons:  the interplay between the central characters.  I hated Oliver and Trey and Alex and Vollchek and Johnny et al. but loved Sandy standing up for his principles, the wonderful interplay between Summer and Seth, Ryan and Marissa's mutual attraction despite their backgrounds.  Everything else I put up with so I could enjoy that part of the show.  But more and more this all retreated to the background.  To be honest, pretty much the only reason I continued watching the show throughout Season Three was to enjoy the improbable relationship between Summer and Seth.  As unhappy as I was with Season 3, I will probably at least start off watching the show in Season 4 just to see how they are doing.  But my interest in the show is at this point on life support.<br /><br />No question that the single biggest development in the entire run of the show was the death of Marissa.  As much as some fans want her to come back, she is definitely dead and definitely won't be back.  Mischa Barton's departure from the show seems to be a mutual decision.  As the show's highest profile character (she has appeared on numerous magazine covers the past three years), she has undoubtedly been contemplating leaving TV for the movies for some time, a move accelerated by her well-publicized financial obligations owing to a break up.  Even if she and the producers wanted her back, she is already tied to several movies projects and unable to do so.  There are many fans who watched the show just to see if Ryan and Marissa would get back together.  For them her departure could be fatal to their interest in the show.  But the fact is that almost all of the horrible characters I noted earlier were connected to the show via Marissa.  Almost all of the worst things in the show were narratively tied to Marissa.  So, there is a real chance that the show could develop in different and better directions.  But I am fearful that the writers and producers will continue in the direction the show has gone, bringing in one awful character after another, having the main characters engage in self-defeating or self-destructive behavior.  When I first started watching the show, it was largely because of elements it shared with a show like THE GILMORE GIRL (on which Adam Brody was a character).  I was hoping for a comedy with dramatic subplots, but instead the show has descended more and more into melodrama with less and less comedy.  But I'm hoping that in Season 4 they can shift the focus more onto Summer and Seth and thereby emphasize the comedic elements that made the show so much fun in the first two seasons.  But, I'm prepared to be disappointed.this endless parade of unlikable characters and stupid behavior on the part of the main characters (except Summer, who seems to be the only character immune to occasional idiocy--her aside, there were numerous occasions when you wanted to smack all of the major characters aside the head and yell, \\"Will you get a grip!\\"), fan discontent grew and grew and ratings of the show fell precipitously.

0321127420|4.0|Even if you find enterprise stuff immensely dull, dealing with databases and web pages is a pretty common task, most of the action in software development revolves around it, and who wants to be completely ignorant of the the alphabet soup of various technologies the IT blogs, books and websites are floating in? <br /> <br />So if you must immerse yourself in this area, what better than a Martin Fowler book? The code is mainly in Java, with a fairly large smattering of C#. It would probably help if you understood some basics of enterprise development in those languages, e.g. servlets and JDBC for Java.  <br /> <br />The patterns in this book cover organising domain logic, database mapping and access, web presentation, concurrency, and the book finishes by covering base patterns, a mixture of lower level abstractions of the sort covered in Fowler's first book, Analysis Patterns (e.g. Money), and those that bear a close resemblance to the classic Gang of Four patterns, with an enterprise twist (e.g. Plugin and Gateway). Nearly all the other patterns refer to these, so I don't know why these didn't appear first. Apart from that though, the book is very well organised. And the opening essay, that discusses the trade offs of every pattern and how they fit together in an application, is immensely helpful.  <br /> <br />Wizened enterprisers looking for new material will not find much new here, but surely the point of patterns catalogues are to get down on paper the practices of those same wizened enterprisers, not to strike off in new directions. Therefore, an experienced developer should see this as a way to organise what they already know, and maybe in doing so, reveal some new insights.  <br /> <br />A newcomer to enterprise development will definitely get a lot out of this, as the underpinnings to the plethora of modern enterprise applications are laid bare. You're not going to become a Hibernate, Struts or EJB expert from this book, but you should at least have a clueabout what problems they're trying to solve. <br /> <br />As usual, Fowler manages to be a model of clarity, while still injecting regular touches of wry humour, quite an achievement given the potentially bone-dry material. If you want to know the basics of enterprise software, start here.

Starting with her successes as a young adult, The Bell Jar is a fictionalized autobiography, in which she gives herself a different name. It chronicles her life through her mental breakdown, including electroshock therapy, and her fellow patients.  Accuratly discribing the stresses of a girl in the 1950's, including whether to be a good little housewife or to follow her dreams. What should she choose?  <br />The book is easy to read and quick.  <br />This book, written a few years before Plath's suicide, makes subsequent accounts of insane asylums seem inconsequential, dull, and whiney.  <br />You'll never look at mental institution fiction the same again.

In terms of can't-put-down-nonstop-reading, Deception Point is probably THE best of the three I have read. Angels and Demons finishes at a VERY close second and da vinci falls in place at third. the different all have themes, as davinci and angels with religion and deception and digital with science so it mostly depends what you are into.

B00005JOML|5.0|Quick, what year is it? -- because it sounds like some of you who are disappointed in the new MIAMI VICE movie haven't gotten rid of your parachute pants yet.    Come on, admit it -- you guys just couldn't wait to see a certain Sonny Crockett wearing the iconic white linen suit, the pastel henley shirt, and the sockless espadrilles again, right? -- and now you can't stand seeing an Irishman with a handlebar moustache doing the same role in dark colors. In the backs of your minds, you never gave it a chance.    You're probably the same kinds of killjoys who'll whine if the next James Bond film doesn't haul out each and every expected cliche from that franchise. God forbid if Bond doesn't purr his name at a baccarat table! Cry sacrilege!    It's time to wake up and smell the now.    Michael Mann, creator and mastermind of the highly influential Miami Vice TV series, has retooled his invention into an even sleeker, faster, more muscular, and thoroughly modern machine of a feature-length film. Those of us who remember watching the original series hoped for years to see a feature-length film of our favorite show -- and we knew it had to do things and take us places the show never could. And damn if the film doesn't do just that. It has all the style, attitude, sex, and violence of the series and then some, with the machismo turned up on afterburner. We jetset from Miami to Paraguay to Cuba to Colombia and back with all the ease of the rich and infamous. Miami Vice has never looked badder or slicker or tougher than it does on the big screen. The series almost looks like it's on a low flame by comparison.    The film begins without any preamble, stomps on the gas, and hardly lifts off until it's all over. There's little time for a breath, and even the contemplative scenes burn with a restless intensity worthy of the series' best moments. I expected the cinematography to be very carefully crafted, emphasizing beautiful, colorful shots -- but thankfully, it doesn't look overly calculated. There's a lot of handheld camerawork, mixing digital and film, and many shots almost look hastily, brazenly filmed, as though in a cinema verite style. An obligatory panning shot of our protagonists from a car's hood -- something else the series made iconic -- somehow looks astonishingly fresh and alive on the big screen.    One could definitely make quibbles about some of the decisions made for the film. After a while, some of the cheesier ideas of the series began to creep in. The meet with the cartel's operations man looks like a hundred similar scenes from the series -- although it has its potentially explosive moments. I would have liked to hear a little gallows humor, at least, but I could understand why Mann probably wanted to avoid being glib, like the series could be at times. I think Crockett wins over Gong Li's character, Isabella, far too quickly and not quite convincingly, but then that's not atypical of Miami Vice storylines. Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx both look comfortable in their roles, although I'm not sure they show enough chemistry together. I will agree that Foxx is pretty under-utilized, and the characterizations are a little too shallow for us to really care about them. For Gong Li, this might be her best English-language role to date -- helped by a lot of looping in post-production -- and she's able to show off her expressive talents, as always. She even rolls her R's like any good Spanish-speaker.    The film has a number of thrilling, boldly edited action scenes and surprise moments -- usually punctuated by blood-spattering violence -- including a showstopper of a scene that could have been pulled straight out of a Dirty Harry movie. A climactic firefight in a deserted shipyard -- although hardly original -- tops any staged for the series, and it's reminiscent of the gigantic bank shootout in another hard-bitten Mann film, HEAT. I was also quite impressed by how the end title was presented, which was a very brave creative decision.    This isn't a perfect movie, but it doesn't really try to be, either. It succeeds at being the baddest boy on the block, swaggering with attitude. MIAMI VICE has boatloads of it, and maybe that's too much for you to handle, pal.    ****1/2
1573226521|5.0|Great book about living a beach life in Thailand. This book came out in 98 I'd been to Thailand a year before on holiday. Read this while commuting across London to work. It must have effected me since I packing up and moving here a couple of years later. Been here in Bangkok Thailand for the last 4 years.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Robot Hive/Exodus has eclipsed everything Clutch have ever done in my opinion. I am a metal fan who has always though to myself \\"Rock is Dead\\". This album has made me rethink that-there is a colorful resurgence of rock music in the \\"hard\\" music genres right now. <br /> <br />Of all the other bands making Hard Rock music, C! are the kings right now.
B000EGCITG|3.0|Now, I love Pink, but one thing I DIDN'T love was her last album Try This. The problem I had with it was that it was all over the place. It was also the point where Pink started using a lot of profanity -- not to add more feeling to the songs, mind you; instead, it was swearing just for the sake of swearing. And it's the same story on I'm Not Dead.<br /><br />Things do start off pretty interesting with the first two singles. \\"Stupid Girls\\" is an obvious gimmick, but it's still pretty entertaining (FYI: although Pink name-checks 50 Cent in the first verse, and 50 also appears in the video, that's not him doing the adlibs; it's some unknown guy). And although \\"Who Knew\\" has pretty simplistic lyrics, it's still much better than the rest of the songs -- well, except for the acoustic hidden track \\"I Have Seen the Rain\\".<br /><br />But then rolls in mediocrity, which is found in lame tracks like \\"Cuz I Can\\". \\"Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely)\\" is confusing, \\"Dear Mr. President\\" and \\"U + Ur Hand\\" are both been-there-done-that tales, and the braggadocio-filled \\"I Got Money Now\\" is just sorry. I mean, Pink can still sing, but her material is now so varied that it seems to be inspired and uninspired at the same time. SHE may not be dead, but her style is sure getting to that point.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This album is wonderful from start to finish.  Put Your Records On is my new favorite song.  If you're wondering who she might compare to: think of Norah Jones/Macy Gray/Sade all mixed together in a beautiful unassuming British voice.  I love this album and I have now bought it four times as birthday gifts for friends. Highly recommended music for anyone in a happy mellow mood.
B000ETQRCM|4.0|When I found out that Pearl Jam was going to be on Saturday Night Live, I was surprised because I didn't even know they had anything out recently (\\"World Wide Suicide\\" was the latest single at the time but I don't listen to the radio much). And I was especially surprised that they were going to be on SNL (albeit for the third time) because that meant they had to (*gasp*) appear in a public photo. All jokes aside, Eddie Vedder and the boys do an excellent job on their self-titled album.<br /><br />Now, I'm not telling people to expect another Ten or anything, but there are still great songs to be found, like \\"Gone\\" and \\"Severed Hand\\". Other good songs include \\"Marker In the Sand\\" and their latest single, \\"Life Wasted\\". But what could be the best song is the album's closer, \\"Inside Job\\" (the only song Vedder didn't write).<br /><br />If it wasn't for the okay three-in-a-row in the middle of the album (\\"Parachutes\\", \\"Unemployable\\" and \\"Big Wave\\"), this could possibly have been a classic. But Pearl Jam still proves with their self-titled album that they can produce the same kind of power that they brought back in '91. Pick it up.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
