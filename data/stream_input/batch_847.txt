B00003CXWV|5.0|The movie Blow is based on the story of George Jung, who played a major role in the United States cocaine trade.  Certainly, the movie authentically represents the cocaine trade, and the people that Jung dealt with, but it was not as loyal to the portrayal of Jung's emotional side (i.e. his obsession with women and sex, his strange habits, and his total pleasure seeking life style). Instead, Johnny Depp portrayed the role of a good hearted man with good values who got into the business as a result of being mistreated by life events. I couldn't help but bonding with, and relating to this supposedly bad character.<br /><br />Regardless of how faithful the movie depicted real life characters, I know that the moral lesson of crime and punishment was delivered through a wonderful touching acting of the entire cast.<br />Johnny Depp and Ray Loitta delivered an amazing performance. The scene of the old father listening to a tape of his son's voice is one of the most powerful scenes I've ever seen. The love Jung has for his daughter and his suffering because of his absence from her life was very credibly delivered by Depp and little Emma Roberts<br /><br />The final scene with Depp's introspection is very touching; I still remember his voice saying:<br />\\"Through out my life, I gave pieces of my heart to people I loved, that I don't have enough of my heart to keep me living\\".<br /><br />I watched this movie at least 10 times since 2001 and I know it will remain one of my heart's dearest movies. Today, I made the surprising discovery on Wikipedia that Kristina Sunshine actually visited her father in jail after watching this movie. Now that the man is paying for his mistakes, it's really good to know that his daughter has decided to visit him before he dies.
B000BISBDY|5.0|This is an amazing compliation of all of Johnny Cash's work.  I would hightly recommend this CD over many of the other compliations as this is all emcompassing compared to some of the others!
B000E8QVWY|5.0|Even though I'm not a big Johnny Cash fan, I watched this movie, anyway.  Boy am I glad I did.  It was a great story, with wonderful acting.  I can't remember seeing a bad movie yet, that Reese Witherspoon, did.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|I have seen this movie a while back. I must say, from beginning to end, I was at the edge of my seat. The story is very typical Asian Extreme horror like the Grudge and Ju-On but this one has it's own surprises and twists that add to the plotline. The only thing you have to be patient with are reading the subtitles since the movie is from Thailand. It helped that Ananda Everingham's face is on the screen 99% of the time. He is quite a cutie. :o) Watch it, rent it and enjoy it better than the US version.
B000005DSN|4.0|I am a huge fan of Hammerfall, Edguy, Gamma Ray, classics like Maiden, Priest and now Stratovarious.  I love metal music with great vocals and harmonious melodies.  Stratovarious is a great \\"happy\\" metal band (think Helloween with keyboards).      Visions is yet another fantastic album with 10 very solid tracks.  Not a bad choice for new comers to sample, and anyone who is all ready a fan will not be disappointed.
031606792X|5.0|I must say that the Twilight saga is probably one of the best vampire love sagas around. When I read the first three books, I was so \\"high\\" off of the love triangle between Bella, Edward and Jacob. This final chapter of their love saga is not as intense as the previous ones but I could totally understand because it seemed like overkill to create more intense drama than what they already endured. Frankly, I thought it was a good \\"winding down\\" phase. It still had enough action (the Volturi) to keep the reader going. I say it's a great closing chapter to the Twilight love series. I actually would give the book FOUR**** stars for story quality and I gave an extra star* for getting an awesome deal on the slipcase. You can't beat Amazon! Having said that, have a great day everyone!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This is a great movie for young viewers not to mentions grown-ups can also enjoy.  This is pretty much a timeless movie which can be watched for many many years.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|I have heard some adults are not crazy about this series. I enjoy it with the kids. My kids 5 and 6 years old love it. They like seeing the progression of Anakin and watch it over and over. They especially love the young Anakin racing. I am no expert on Star Wars, but this series is a big hit in our house.

1439102813|4.0|Still Alice is still with me although I read it a few months ago. This is a realistic story, harrowing, and told without sentimentality, about a woman who comes to discover that she has Early Onset Alzheimers and her slide to the full onslaught of this dreadful disease. It is particularly insightful and riveting as it is told from the woman's point of view and so we follow her terrifying journey into madness. I was moved to tears when, toward the end, she can no longer remember why she has stored a cache of pills.  Lisa Genova has written a moving, informative novel which will keep you interested until the last page. It is a story that will bring the tragedy of this disease to millions and hopefully hasten the discovery of a cure.  Lisa Genova is a deft writer and you know you are in competent hands from the first page. Her knowledge of the topic shines through without any sense of preaching. I look forward to her next book.
159448385X|5.0|This is yet another wonder read from this author! If you loved Kite Runner, you'll like this too. Since the story focuses on 2 women, its probably not as universal in its appeal as kite runner, but nonetheless, its beautiful! I would recommend it to anyone who wants a glimpse into the lives of some not-so-fortunate women in the third world countries....even though radical, it does seem plausible in most parts. The author seamlessly transitions from history to fiction and vice-versa. I am soon gonna add this author to my \\"must read\\" list!
030014332X|5.0|In history, context is vital. Events seldom make sense when presented individually, and often, the only way to fully understand, comprehend and appreciate any given event in history is to know the chain of events that led to it. Learning about the Second World War is difficult without at least a basic knowledge of the First World War and how that was influenced by the Industrial revolution. Context is vital.    Over the weekend, I picked up a book that I've long wanted to read, shown to me by a friend several years ago when it was first translated into English: A Little History of the World. First written and published in 1936 (written in six weeks - SIX), this book covers a staggering amount of history, starting from the very beginnings of human history and culture, from the prehistoric eras, and running up through to the dropping of the atomic bombs in 1945. Needless to say, in 284 pages, this is not a book rife with specific details, names and dates. Rather, this is an extremely broad look at how human history progressed.    While there are plenty of details lacking, this book is not intended as a grand work of history. It's written simply, for a younger audience, to tell the tale of our existence - it helps to provide a broad context for our history to anyone who is mildly interested in the subject, and at this, the book succeeds wonderfully. As a student of history, I can appreciate the task at hand, and having read through the book in a day, I was astounded at just how much information is here. Almost every major era of human history is covered, and linked to the next - reading over the pages, we move from the Egyptian dynasties to ancient Babylon, to Greece, to Rome, to the Middle Ages and so on, up through to the present day. Most of the major events in the world are touched upon, but only so much to move the story along from point to point.    While there is a high degree to completeness to this volume, there are aspects of history that are not examined, even lightly - the American Civil War is talked about briefly, but only in the context of the role of Slavery (which is really not the right way to examine the war) nor is the European involvements in Africa really looked at, except in the context of the buildup to the First World War. This book is largely a view of the world through Western eyes, and talk from the Americas and Asia aren't really examined as much, which is a disappointment, not out of any sort of nationalistic sense, but to the degree to which some of the major events in US history have played in the world - the Great Depression is not mentioned (although the history here really ends after the end of the First World War), but there is very little about the history of Central and South America or Africa. Reading the preface, it was mentioned that Gombrich intended to expand the book with the translation of an English version that would have talked more about Shakespeare, the Bill of Rights and the English Civil War, but he passed away before he was able to do this. I would have been interested to see how he would have characterized the rest of the 20th century, with the incredible changes and advancements that we have experienced since the end of the Second World War.    That being said, this book is a good examination of the world from a very high level - while smaller details are largely not talked about (specific important battles, such as Marathon, Waterloo, etc, are mentioned), the notion of how all these events fit together is the dominant one - specific knowledge of battles is not really necessary at most points, save when they are truly decisive historically, changing the course of nation's histories. In my day of reading the book, I feel that I have a somewhat better understanding about how parts of the world fit together - while I knew most of the details of what had gone on, there were points in history where I was fuzzy on the broad details. This is a book that I wish I had read when I wasin middle or high school, because of the broad examination here.    An interesting point that I found here was the voice to which Gombrich takes throughout - very light, and while military matters are covered frequently, warfare is never glorified - the preface notes that the publication of the book in Germany was halted because it was deemed too pacifist in Nazi Germany.    On an aesthetic level, the book is easy to read - the language is simple, intended for somewhat older children, and is divided into forty short chapters, each with a specific section of history. One of the most interesting parts here is the illustrations at the beginning of each chapter - a simple woodcut that is best representative of the theme or period of the chapter, which is very characteristic of the work here - it adds beauty and a bit of elegance to the pages here.    I loved every minute and every page of this book. While this is the broadest possible view of human history, it is done with skill and grace, with an impartial voice throughout, that points out our successes and our flaws as a race, with an incredible amount of wisdom behind it. To best describe this book is an introduction of history, from which any reader would be inspired to find more about any aspect of history that they so wished. I'm now going to make it a point to seek out his second major work, The Story of Art. In the meantime, this will become a treasured addition to my own library of books.    The title of this book can be somewhat misleading - A Simple History of the World might be more accurate, but A History of the World would be the best, because Gombrich has done a nearly impossible task - distilled the world's history into a concise, yet interesting story that is optimistic, critical and inspiring.

0312370849|5.0|Sarah's Key is a remarkable and insightful book.  Although Tatiana de Rosnay clearly states in the \\"Author's Note\\" at the beginning of the novel that it \\"is not a historical work and has no intention of being one,\\" Sarah's Key offers knowledge about France and World War II that most history books do not.  Like [[ASIN:058241928X Snow Falling on Cedars]] taught me about the Japanese internment camps on the West Coast of the United States during World War II, Sarah's Key teaches that the French police were involved in the round-up of French Jews during World War II and sending them off to Nazi concentration camps.  These are incidents that went on during WWII that those who were not alive during that time period probably have no idea happened because it was not taught to them in school.  My history teachers certainly never touched on them.  In the history books we read, only the Germans were made to look bad; not the French, and certainly not Americans.<br /><br />Sarah's Key bounces back and forth between two different time periods with every other chapter.  One story in the novel involves a Jewish family and, in particular, the young daughter Sarah, in 1942.  The other story involves a woman, Julia, in present-day France learning about the Vel d'Hiv round-up as well as wrestling her own moral dilemma with a decision about the pregnancy that her near-fifty-year-old husband does not want. The more you read (and this isn't a spoiler), the more you can't wait to find out what the connection is going to be between Sarah in 1942 and Julia in present-day France.  Once the connection was revealed about halfway through the book, I craved even more.  Thankfully, de Rosnay continued with more details about both Sarah's and Julia's lives and did not leave me hanging.<br /><br />The majority of the characters throughout Sarah's Key were well fleshed-out.  With the exception of some of Julia's interchangeable French friends, I felt like I knew most of the characters.  I was thankful for having \\"met\\" them.<br /><br />As for the author's style, her conversational writing flowed throughout the entire book.  It made for an easy, enjoyable read, and I truly appreciated the short chapters.  They gave me easy stopping points when I needed to break to attend to my own life's details, but most times they ended and I felt compelled to continue with \\"just one more.\\" Her story became that engaging, and I needed to know what happened next.<br /><br />Jumping between time periods can sometimes be confusing if it's not done properly.  Thankfully, the publisher went as far as to help the reader distinguish between the two by using two different fonts throughout the novel.  For the chapters in present-day, a crisp, modern font was used.  For chapters set in 1942, an older and more rugged-looking font was used.<br /><br />All in all, I loved Sarah's Key.  It's another great story about a difficult time in history, much like [[ASIN:067182449X Anne Frank - The Diary of a Young Girl]].  What's the \\"Key,\\" you ask?  You'll have to read it to find out!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|Great product but it took a little longer than expected to get to me.  It was around Christmas time so maybe that's the reason for the delay.
0375413405|4.0|This is a fantastic volume of classic kitchen instruction. Everything is in here: Kitchen Equipment, Definitions, Ingredients, Measures, Temperatures, Cutting (chopping, slicing, dicing, and mincing), Wines, Soups, Sauces, Eggs, Entrees, Fish, Poultry, Meat, Vegetables, Cold Buffet, Desserts and Cakes. Everything except the Kitchen Equipment chapter contains titles and definitions in English and French.<br /><br />If you cooked your way cover to cover you'd be just fine in the kitchen without another cookbook.<br /><br />There are no photos, just a few line drawings where necessary.<br /><br />The recipes are written just as other reviewers have stated, which is to say there is a master recipe followed by variations. For an example my favorite recipe in the book is for Supremes de Volaille Archiduc (Chicken Breasts with Paprika, Onions, and Cream). To prepare the recipe I have to go back and forth between that recipe and the master recipe which is Supremes de Volaille a Blanc (Breast of Chicken with Cream). Fortunately they are on adjacent pages but it's still frustrating.<br /><br />I completely understand the reasons for formatting the book in this way. 1) It saves pages by avoiding redundant instructions and 2) The whole idea is to master the basic recipe first and then learn the variations. I get it. It's like a textbook. But I work a full time job - I don't have enough time to work this book cover to cover. I have to prepare full meals at night, not just practice the same recipe until I have it mastered so that's why I take a star off.<br /><br />As far as instruction goes, boy it's as specific as all get out. Read recipes carefully. Actually read the whole chapter first, then make the recipe. Here is an example of that: The first time I made Coq au Vin (Chicken in Red Wine with Onions, Mushrooms, and Bacon) it came out horrible. It was tough, with a watery sauce and I hated it. So I backed up to the beginning of the chapter and learned I was using the wrong kind of chicken and why. I had a broiler when I should have been using a fryer, a roaster, or a stewing chicken. So I made it again and the chicken was better. It's not my favorite Coq au Vin recipe (Cooks Illustrated gets the award for that one) but it's good, classic, and if you follow the instructions you won't go wrong.<br /><br />This book even tells you exactly which pot and/or pan to use, what size to cut the ingredients and if you flip to the front there are illustrations explaining how to slice and dice. I've been cooking for a couple decades and there were still plenty of techniques I didn't have mastered.<br /><br />This book really has it all. Learn how to make Hollandaise sauce, pastry dough, quenelles!, souffles!, and more. If you have the patience you'll find this to be one of, if not the most valuable cookbooks in your collection. Don't just buy it and put it on the shelf to open for one or two recipes. Keep it in the kitchen. Refer to it often. I think anyone's cooking will improve from these techniques, whether he or she is a beginner or more advanced.r when I should have been using a fryer, a roaster, or a stewing chicken.

006117758X|3.0|I found this to be a well written book.  There was certainly a lot of character development, and the environment was constructed nicely.  However, I kept waiting for some sort of redeeming qualities of the main character, Henry.  He seems to be pretty unforgivable.  I will say that I had the same feelings about Catcher in the Rye, and people really enjoy that book.  I would suggest this book to those that enjoy the Nihilistic style, but I would not go back and read it again.

All of the ornamentation on the book looks great, and lends it the feel of truly being a tome of magnificent proportions.

B001I1OHHC|3.0|It's generally considered a comic masterpiece, and although I found a good deal of it amusing I also found it somewhat troubling. Underneath the humor author John Kennedy Toole's portrayal of all the characters is kind of cruel, taking all of their negative traits and highlighting them as strongly as he could. The implicit view of the book is also bleak; even if the characters weren't all fools it wouldn't much matter how well they would try to accomplish anything, because they would still be subjected to luck and forces outside of their control. The book's humor is a kind of schadenfreude.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Mamma Mia! is a fun movie, which is exactly what it is suppossed to be.  It is not Fiddler on The Roof or Camelot or any serious musical, it is a musical that is based on ABBA tunes, so you know what it is suppossed to be since ABBA is well known as a pop ctachy songwriting group.    And the pop catchy comes through in the movie.  The movie is visually wonderful and Greece looks absolutely beautiful, and Meryl Streep gives her usual first class performance and sings very well. Amanda Seyfried (from Big Love) was also a pleasent suprise in her perforrmance and vocals.    Perhaps some of the cast did not quite hold their own vocally, but the movie is still just fun.  When I want to watch serious musicals I will watch other ones, but to just relax and have fun putting this DVD is a perfect one.
0375507256|5.0|This is not your normal work of fiction. With six separate stories, each in a different era and written in a different tone and style, this book takes some getting used to. But for the reader who sticks with the book through the first chapter, the stories are rewarding and thought provoking. What makes this book more than a collection of short stories is that each story is connected somehow to the story before it. The only catch is that as each story picks up the pace, it is suddenly interrupted and the reader moves on to the next story. After completing the sixth story uninterrupted, a story of a post-apocalypse people in Hawaii, no less, the reader zooms through each of the stories in reverse order picking up where the story left off. The main character in each story is distinguished by a unique birthmark, leading the reader to believe that it is the same soul reincarnated through time. The writing is clever and entertaining and Mitchell is ingenious to be able to pull this off.  Few writers could create such a masterful book. Well done, David Mitchell, well done.

It was not laborious to read but it just didn't move me. The funky narrative was OK but I kept wanting to compare it to Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close and it just didn't hold a candle.  The similes and metaphors were way overdone and most just didn't make sense! I also didn't care for the foreshadowing. It seemed to want to put my mind at ease but what it ended up doing was just easing the tension. I don't want the tension eased when I read a book! I'm sorry but not a book to remember in my opinion. Diary of Anne Frank is not fiction and that is what makes it so compelling. The one thing I did like about it was the viewpoint of Nazi Germany from a non-Jewish perspective.

I have watched the disc several times over, and one more time with special attention to the audio sync after reading the complaints here.    I guarantee you: there is absolutely no sync problem mastered onto the disc. It is not there. People are probably experiencing display lag or some other decoding/delay issue with their equipment. This happens with hi-def displays at times and sometimes calibration is necessary.    Do NOT hesitate to buy this disc based on this concern.    One more thing: Don't worry that it's shot in 1080i and not 1080p. Your 1080p sets should deinterlace the image anyway. It should be entirely a non-issue as well, and is.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I've always loved this movie!  I only owned this on VHS, and it was time to update.
B00005K3OT|2.0|My criticism here is about the issue of chocolate. This movie must have had backing by Ghirardelli chocolate, because it seems to be an obvious plug for selling more chocolate. They made it sound like chocolate is good for you. Well it is, the way the Mayans drank it. Nowadays it's loaded with sugar and butterfat, which we're all now finding out how serious the damage is from refined pollutants that sends your adrenals on a roller-coaster ride.     Don't believe the sugar-coated acting of Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche, they're mainstream people who don't understand the messages they have the power to produce. Sure, I sound like a whiny party-pooper, but then, someone had to say this.

B001KL3GWM|4.0|After releasing the tour de force album SONGLINES in 2006, I have eagerly awaited the follow up from the very talented Derek Trucks Band.  While the newly released ALREADY FREE does not match the majesty of SONGLINES, it's still is a very good album by one of the best working bands out there.<br /><br />To me, this album represents a tightening of their eclectic approach to music, no doubt trying to consolidate their fame as a great live group.  ALREADY FREE focuses on the blues/soul side of the band at the expense jazz/world fusion side.  While I miss the expansive jams that have highlighted their previous releases, the focus on songcraft and tight ensemble playing does not diminish the joy factor too much.  Derek and the band provide a solid set of tunes in a swamp-funk blues style while expanding their songwriting chops and serving up some choice covers.  My favorites include the opening semi-obscure Dylan tune DOWN IN THE FLOOD, BACK WHERE I STARTED which features a great vocal turn by Mrs. Trucks, Susan Tedeshi, GET WHAT YOU DESERVE and the slide guitar showcase I KNOW.  Actually, all the songs are pretty good, to my ears, there's no real weak link here.  The copy that I received also has 3 bonus tracks including a back porch blues called THE CHICKEN ROBBER SONG and a slow simmering instrumental SWAMP, another highlight.  Throughout the album the band provides solid backing and provides good space for Trucks to solo.  With all his chops, Trucks does not showboat as a soloist.  He articulates his message short and sweet and always perfectly within the context of the song.<br /><br />I hope that by taking a more conservative direction on this release that the DTB can gain some more well deserved recognition.  I also hope that with that recognition that the band does on occasion revisit the wide ranging influences that have made their previous albums such a treat for music lovers.  In the meantime, I'm sure I'll be getting plenty of listening pleasure from this one.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jeff Beck has never been a household name. He has avoided being the center of attention for over 40 years now.  You hear so very little from Jeff Beck that when something is released you savor it. This CD is no exception. Certain artist elevate their talent. Jeff Beck is the greatest living guitar player in the world.  His music like Jimi Hendrix is a fustion of styles including, blues, jazz, rock, and other styles as well. Jeff Beck as Hendrix did drew from several generas to get his unique style.  Another thing of note is his bass player, the very young lady Tal Wilkenfeld. If you have seen her she is a delight to watch. When the DVD comes out you will see what I mean.  Having bought his online releases Jeff Beck live at BB Kings Blues club and another simply titled Jeff Beck. I figured this could be more of the same. Having listened to it I find this is superior to either of those recordings, I dont know if its because his band is better or if the quality of the recording is better. This almost sounds like a studio recording.  Beck's playing is the best I have heard. He has been on the road quite a bit the last few years and he is at the top of his game.  Among the highlights are: Cause we ended as lovers, Led Boots, Big Block, Where were you.  This is the type of CD you will put on and listen from beginning to end.  I cant wait to see the DVD................

1593072937|5.0|Frank Miller's imagination inhabits the harshly-lit night of the underbelly of gritty Sin City. It is a place where the thugs and hookers are brutal (yet vulnerable) and the cops and priests are black-souled goons. \\"The Hard Goodbye,\\" Miller's film-noirish first volume in the Sun City series, gives us the harsh and violent story of Marv, the schizoid, pulp-faced ultraviolent antihero whose iron mitts are as hard as his life. This is a revenge novel. Marv, whose rough, broken face and dim-watt mind make him unattractive, has had the time of his life with a beautiful blonde who turns up dead. Marv goes hunting for the silent killer who did in the only women who ever loved him. His path of blood and destruction with his favorite handgun, \\"Gladys,\\" takes him through confessional booths, back-alley strip clubs, crooked priests, rampaging cops and a cannibal farm. Not a tale for the faint of heart, but Miller tells it with a Bogey swagger and a series of epic pen-and-ink panels that spin around the characters as they struggle through a vortex of mayhem, torture and desperate love.<br /><br />Great read, and better re-read. But don't leave it where the kiddies will find it!

They are at a par with the Doors box set,and the Talking Heads Brick, which up until now were the two best remasterings I have heard in the 10,000 cd collection I own. The instruments can FINALLY be heard the way they were meant to be heard, and Peter Gabriel's vocals are out-of-this-world!!!  Buy this now!!!

There are many other great recipes, as well. One of the best parts about it is that my kids tried new things because it said something like \\"Han Solo Burger\\" as opposed to just a \\"burger.\\"  I use this all the time now.  \\"You know that new juice I bought is from Tatooine....you should try it.\\"  \\"Those green beans come from Endor, you should try them...\\"  I also only cook gluten free, so I modified the recipe using the Authentic Foods Multi-Grain Gluten Free Flour and a 1 tsp of xanthun gum.
0525951113|4.0|(hands down the best line in the book)<br /><br />Admittedly I am not a huge consumer of sci-fi/techno suspense novels.  I go more for fantasy, if I have to choose between the two.  So when I first saw the title of first time novelist Daniel Suarez's book Daemon, I thought of Lyra's Pan.  Of course I knew that wasn't right, BUT that's the biggest lit reference I have for the word daemon in my mind.<br /><br />That's no longer the case.<br /><br />From the beginning of the book, Suarez hooks the reader in with a mysterious death.  Before long we learn of a killer of a computer program, the Daemon, which has been initiated and is in places you couldn't even imagine.<br /><br />The entire story follows the paths of a handful of characters on both sides of the lines (though one is left wondering if there are really any lines by the book's end). Detective Peter Sebeck leads the list of characters on one side and CyberStorm CEO Matthew Sobol the other.  Funny thing is, one of them is dead.<br /><br />Throughout the book Suarez pumps the reader's brain with gobs of technical jargon and argot.  To be honest, if I didn't have a tech-field husband, a self-proclaimed computer geek of a dad, and 16-year old younger brother, I may not have heard of many of the things discussed in this book.  Regardless, Suarez does a near masterful job (and certainly better than some of Chrichton's early work) of using the mystery words in a way that makes it feel like I understand what's going on.  There were portions toward the last third of the book that tended to be lengthier technical dialog explanations, but they always came to their point eventually.<br /><br />Beyond the language used, the story (and sup-plots) are all terribly engaging in their own right. I often felt like I was reading a techno thriller version of the Stand, but much shorter.  As new characters were introduced it soon became clear how they fit into the story or the Daemon's plan.<br /><br />The actions scenes were wildly intense and I often shared the fervor of the characters as they faced challenges to overcome and unbelievable disasters...truly some gruesome stuff.<br /><br />In the end, I powered through this book because I really wanted to see how he tied up all these loose story threads and who 'won'.  And perhaps the moral of his story is the latter concept of winning is null.<br /><br />The only issue I had with the book was the wrap up.  There wasn't one, really.  While the reader sees the ultimate fates of a few characters (only one having been a major player and another a minor one), the door is pretty much left wide open for what comes next in this new world order.  Book number 2?  Probably.<br /><br />That being said, the book was a great read and I'd highly recommend it to anyone with the slightest interest in the world of computers and how we humans tend to coexist with them.  The solid storytelling and captivating turns of events will leave you seriously questioning:  This is his first book??rs as they faced challenges to overcome and unbelievable disasters...truly some gruesome stuff.

0956010903|5.0|The collectors edition of Beedle the Bard, is spectacular!    When the package arrived and we opened it to reveal the large olde world hard leather protective case which houses the actual book,safely nestled inside; it held the promise of a sense of mystery, intrigue and something more.    It was irresistible! After taking a few moments to study the intricate details of ornamentally adorned cover of the book and admiring the sketches which are also included inside the case. I couldn't wait to open the book and begin reading. I read the entire book that night. The stories were wonderful, unique and also held a moral. These original tales by Beedle, the Bard, were slightly reminiscent, but definitely not copies of tales compiled by and re-told by the Grimm Brothers.    Beedle the Bard is a must for all Harry Potter fans, for it enhances what we have already known, read and love enough to read again.    It is a book I will read again!
B0006J28KU|5.0|With all of the buzz surrounding the recent re-teaming of De Niro and Pacino in 2008's [[ASIN:B0015OKWL2 Righteous Kill]], perhaps it is time to revisit the greatest \\"clash of the titans\\" ever committed to film.  Michael Mann's 1995 Los Angeles crime saga provides the basis for much of the negative criticism surrounding the aforementioned KILL, and committing only a small amount of your time will quickly show why.  Sure the film clocks in at just over three hours, but one only need watch approximately half of that time in order to understand why HEAT sets the standard by which any and all future pairings of these two cinematic giants will be rated.  And it is not just the infamous Coffee Shop scene which provides an excuse to love this film; though said scene is certainly well worth waiting for.  (More on this scene in a moment.)  No, the secret to this film creeps into frame at the very moment that the L.A. metro train glides effortlessly toward the viewer - surrounded by smoke and creaking slowly along - carrying inside a silent, brooding and patient master thief, Neil McCauley (De Niro).  And the secret to loving this film is just that... patience.<br /><br />One would expect a crime drama starring De Niro and Pacino (in their first \\"real\\" pairing in film history as most agree that [[ASIN:B0019L21GA The Godfather Part II - The Coppola Restoration]] does not really count since the two mega stars never actually share the screen) to begin with a bang.  And therein lies Mann's genius.  Does Mann choose to open this much anticipated cops-n-robbers action flick with a Hollywood style, big box office bonanza of explosions and shrapnel?  Nope.  Instead Mann eases us into the environment that these two alpha males will inhabit by way of a train ride.  The doors slide open and out into the night steps McCauley.  There is no evidence of the carnage to come as McCauley appears, only a hint of his expertise as he silently scans his surroundings... searching for a sign of anything out of order.<br /><br />Fast forward to a bedroom.  Morning brings with it the promise of lovemaking, as we are introduced in a vastly different way to the man who will become McCauley's adversary, Detective Lieutenant Vincent Hanna (Pacino).  Hanna and his wife Justine, (played with seductive aplomb by Diane Venora) are having a moment... one neither wants interrupted.  Lucky for everyone involved - characters and viewers alike - no interruption presents itself, and both are allowed to finish.  Little do either know that this will be their last such moment together.  For on the horizon lie several days of complicated cat and mouse antics, punctuated by the smell of cordite and the sight of death.<br /><br />And then comes the big bang.  With an expertly planned and craftily executed tractor trailer rig into armored car smash-up, McCauley and his crew (portrayed by a world weary Val Kilmer, a still high in real life Tom Sizemore and a gritty faced Danny Trejo) are off to the races.  And what follows is the stuff of legend.  Only not all of what is presented is legend... much of it is true to life.<br /><br />HEAT was born out of a 1989 television pilot also penned by Mann, entitled L.A.TAKEDOWN, and most if not all of TAKEDOWN appears in the script for HEAT.  (Unfortunately, TAKEDOWN is only available on DVD in Region 2 countries, but is well worth viewing if you can grab a copy.)  TAKEDOWN itself was based in part on stories Mann was told by his good friend and [[ASIN:B000A59Q8C Crime Story - Season One]] collaborator Chuck Adamson.  Adamson (along with CRIME STORY's Dennis Farina) worked as a Detective in the Chicago Police Department's Major Crimes Unit in the late 60's, and was responsible for taking down the real life Neil McCauley.  In fact, the two actually had a face to face in a local coffee shop... just as DeNiro and Pacino do in HEAT.  And the outcome was much the same.<br /><br />When the fateful scene finally comes... boy is it worth the wait.  Having tracked McCauley's scent for several days through cold-blooded murders to successful and aborted heists, Hanna decides to up the ante and confront the man himself.  He suggest a cup of Joe and the two sit down for a chat.  What transpires is by far the meatiest mono-y-mono ever committed to film.  As the two cautiously attempt to relate to one another, they each discover that they share a common principle: They are each unflinchingly committed to one thing and one thing only.  For McCauley that one thing is remaining true to his instincts and guarding himself against becoming attached to, as he puts it, \\"anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you spot the Heat around the corner.\\"  For Hanna, that commitment is to tracking the scent of his prey and holding onto his angst, which, according to Hanna, is the thing that \\"keeps me sharp... on the edge... where I gotta be.\\"  And it is within this discussion of their two intersecting lives, punctuated by dark words and veiled threats, that the most observant of viewers will glean a probing glimpse into the psyche of both actors.  And Mann knew it when he wrote the dialogue.<br /><br />De Niro: \\"It is what it is.  Its either that or we better both go do something else, pal.\\"<br />Pacino: \\"I don't know how to do anything else.\\"<br />De Niro: \\"Neither do I.\\"<br />Pacino: \\"I don't much want to either.\\"<br />De Niro: \\"Neither do I.\\"<br /><br />Then both men smile.... barely.  Want to know why?  Because at this very moment, both men are exposing their true feelings about acting, NOT (as some may think) discussing their character's feelings about their chosen profession.  De Niro and Pacino have let their guard down ever so briefly, and shown the world why they are the best of the best.<br /><br />But HEAT is not all about De Niro and Pacino chewing up the scenery and each other.  Costars Kilmer and Sizemore (in their roles as McCauley's right hand men Chris Shirherlis and Michael Cheritto respectively), Jon Voight (as McCauley's wounded and dogged fence Nate), Natalie Portman (as Hanna's tortured step-daughter Lauren Gustafson), Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi and Ted Levine (as Hanna's fellow Detectives in the Robbery Homicide Division Drucker, Casals and Bosko respectively), Ashley Judd (as Shirherlis' caught between love and the right path wife Charlene) and Amy Brenneman as McCauley's lied to and frail girlfriend Eady) add so much depth to this film that it takes several viewings to fully digest the three course meal that Mann serves up.  The interlocking stories of each character's life, filled with despair, pain and  - at times - hope, move HEAT from the genre of \\"yet another cops-n-robbers flick\\" into the realm of \\"cinema masterpiece.\\"  As for Mann's directing... Mann is THE MAN.  Mann's use of light and shadow, along with his bold and signature over-the-shoulder camera angels create a visual canvass that places the viewer squarely in mid '90's Los Angeles.  Showing off the seamy underbelly of late night L.A., Mann uses this film to expose locations and scents only hinted at in former films such as [[ASIN:B00005JLJW To Live and Die in L.A. (Special Edition)]]  (Mann would eventually expose more of this environment while producing the television series ROBBERY HOMICIDE DIVISION - a show sadly lacking a DVD release - and while directing the Tom Cruise/Jamie Fox show down film [[ASIN:B00005JN2Z Collateral (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].)  Mann is one of the cinemas most daring and detailed Directors, and this film is a high water mark in his ever expanding career.  It is no wonder that fans of both HEAT and TAKEDOWN feel strongly that the former expands and betters the latter by leaps and bounds.  And it is no wonder that HEAT gives detractors of [[ASIN:B0015OKWL2 Righteous Kill]] a lot to gripe about.  HEAT is the once and for all standard by which any and all future pairings of De Niro and Pacino will be rated.  And none will match up.  None could.  Give this film a little patience and you will surely be rewarded.  Because it is the slow build that really pays off.<br /><br />While stalking the crime scene that follows the previously mentioned armored car heist, Hanna offers this observation to describe McCauley's crew:<br /><br />\\"The M.O. is that they're good.\\"<br /><br />It's not just McCauley's crew that are good.  They ALL are.  And so is this film.ctively), Jon Voight (as McCauley's wounded and dogged fence Nate), Natalie Portman (as Hanna's tortured step-daughter Lauren Gustafson), Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi and Ted Levine (as Hanna's fellow Detectives in the Robbery Homicide Division Drucker, Casals and Bosko respectively), Ashley Judd (as Shirherlis' caught between love and the right path wife Charlene) and Amy Brenneman as McCauley's lied to and frail girlfriend Eady) add so much depth to this film that it takes several viewings to fully digest the three course meal that Mann serves up.

B0008ENICU|4.0|Great movie, crisp DVD transfer, tons of extras (my favorite is the audio-only film scoring sessions, which when played together essentially equal a comprehensive soundtrack album of the film ).  The conceit of \\"The Women\\" is that it's just that: women.  There are no male actors, and male characters (those dastardly husbands) are only talked about, or \\"appear\\" just offstage.<br /><br />As a guy, I particularly enjoyed Norma Shearer's mother character, who chided her daughter for being too angry about her husband's philandering.  \\"Boys will be boys,\\" she said.  \\"How can you think about leaving your husband and taking from him the best piece of protection he has while seeing that conniving wench: his legal marriage?\\"  Had to laugh at that, the mom making her daughter feel guilty for wanting to leave her cheating husband.  Another highlight: a particularly radiant Paulette Goddard, who plays one of Norma Shearer's many female friends.<br /><br />At 133 minutes, the movie is a bit long for its subject matter (wives complaining about their husbands, even in a frothy comedy, is good for about an hour and forty-five minutes tops, in my book), but the length isn't a fatal flaw, especially on DVD when you can take a break whenever you want.  In the end, this is a fine film from Hollywood's golden era, and well worth your time.

B0001XALT6|4.0|Sylvester Stallone gives perhaps his best performance since Rocky, the film that put his career into stellar status. Here he has to play against type, sort of (it's hard to say what type Stallone usually plays since Rocky is so unlike Rambo). He clearly is a loser (a somewhat inept but well-meaning guy who has had more than his share of tough breaks) who ultimately redeems himself but then doesn't become a larger-than-life hero in the process. It's sort of like Rocky without the acclaim of going the distance in the ring.      Ray Liotta (as a cop who may be very corrupt but who also gets very close to the sheriff) is equally good. Their two characters' and their relationship are key to understanding and appreciating the story fully, so this movie rises into four-star status because of how the fine performances from them play out in close interaction.      The story has been summarized and analyzed elsewhere, so I will be very brief in what is going to be a very brief review. The film makes great use of NYC and NJ settings, giving it an automatic authenticity. There is a great supporting cast. You could even say the overall effect is an ensemble acting film.     Stallone plays the 'Sheriff of Cop Land'. He is a local hero of a small NJ town across the river from NYC. He couldn't become a real 'COP' because of an ear injury he suffered as a teenager while saving the girl/woman who would become the unrequited love of his life (she doesn't return that love). So he gets to be sheriff of the town where many NYC cops make their home.     Things come to a crisis not simply because some of the NYC cops in the town are caught up in an elaborate corruption scheme. They also reach a climax because the Sheriff of Cop Land wants to know the truth and wants to be taken seriously by the very guys he has always worshipped.     This film is loaded with celebrity acting talent; the only way it could have got made was they waived their usual salaries in order to be in it. Robert De Niro gives a fine performance as an internal affairs cop investigating the bad cops (led by Harvey Keitel).    The scenario upon which the film is predicated plays out as largely unbelievable (a NYC cop, after driving home from a party, shoots and kills two joy riders because he thought they had a weapon and had taken a shot at him, and his fellow cops come up with a scheme to make it appear he has killed himself to avoid charges while keeping him hidden in the NJ town).     This unbelievable scenario makes Harvey Keitel's role problematic, although he does a nice turn trying to keep his part of the film together so it makes sense.    I thought to some extent the female talent in this film, such as Janeane Garofalo (as a deputy in the suburban town) and Annabella Sciorra (as the woman the sheriff longs after), didn't really have roles that gave them enough character development or screen time.

THIS IS NOT THE ROLLING STONES OR THE BEATLES IT IS A COMBINATION.  THIS IS, IN MY OPTINION ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS EVER RELEASED IN THIS DECADE....AND THOSE TO COME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0399247459|5.0|This book is great in that it not only teaches the life cycle of a butterfly, counting to 5, the names of the days of the week, and about different types of food. The actual holes in the book create an intrigue and imagination that a caterpillar really munched his way through.<br /><br />The easy-to-read worlds makes good teaching tool for young children.
0446579939|2.0|I can't say that I was overwhelmed by this book.  It seemed to be the same old Nicholas Sparks.  It was a good book, just nothing new.
0061673730|5.0|The most important part of this book, for me, was that it made me consider what sanity really is. Mr. Pirsig roughly defines sanity as living within the mythos of one's own culture, not necessarily the religious norm, but the philosophical norm. This can be quite an interesting point to ponder when one chooses to live outside the norm. Are they really insane, or just questing onto the \\"road less wandered\\"?<br /><br />Like Phaedras, the Platonic character from which the author takes his alter-ego's name, the question of Quality is also examined in depth. He traces the meaning of this word back to the Ancient Greek idea of arete, or the duty to one's self to always perform in and honorable and exemplary way. This book considers the idea that we no longer value arete or Quality as part of our philosophical norm.<br /><br />As a narrative, this book is about a father reconnecting with his son after having a breakdown. However, at its core, this book is about an inner journey. It is one of those books that can be read over and over again throughout a person's life and you will always find something new of value in it- something that you are receptive to in that moment. Not only do I recommend the book, but I recommend reading it more than once.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|\\"Must see\\" TV for me is defined as watching every episode of \\"True Blood\\" on Sunday night as originally aired then rewatching and savoring each episode as recorded on demand. We watched the first season of \\"True Blood\\" over and over again yet highly anticipate the preordered DVD just so we can view each episode with director and cast member commentary. For instance, at the 42 minute mark in the final episode of the season, Ryan Kwantin who plays Sookie's brother Jason comforts his sister recovering  from the brutal beating she suffered and as Jason turns to leave, trips over the coffee table and nearly falls on his face. I personally think that pratfall was an accident. I'm guessing creator Alan Ball decided to retain that scene because it worked so well and so naturally to define  troubled yet likeable Jason's basic humanity. The commentary track normally included with most DVD packages should disclose if my suspicions are correct.  It will be fun to find out either way.     Virtually every single cast member in this wickedly funny and at times shockingly graphic series is so believable and so downright likeable that the basic story line of vampires coming out of the closet in Louisiana to openly walk among us while demanding equal rights has an uncommon way of encouraging the casual viewer to examine his or her own personal prejudices in off beat, highly entertaining and altogether unexpected ways.     Of course there will always be those who grouse that the storyline does not strictly follow the series of books by Charlaine Harris. Series creator Alan Ball argues there is a very good reason for that. The fact is Anna Paquin, recent Golden Globe winner for her turn as Sookie Stackhouse would be the most overworked actress on the planet if the storyline was strictly adhered to because as the books are written she would dominate virtually every single scene. Whew! Not only that, we would not have become so familiar with several of the wonderful characters we have been introduced to, specifically Tara, Jason and Lafayette as played by Rutina Wesley, Ryan Kwanten, and Nelsan Ellis respectively. These and many, many other gifted actors contribute mightily to making \\"True Blood\\" the runaway hit it has become. As any ardent fan of the book series knows, Season One barely scratched the surface and plenty of rich material has yet to be mined. If the series continues to be skillfully written, \\"True Blood\\" can easily air for 3, 4, even 5 or more seasons. We ain't seen nuttin yet!     Alan Ball has done it again. Good for him. Good for us. \\"True Blood\\" is hands down THE most engaging series on television today.
B0019OP0GU|4.0|Cute movie. Embarrassingly, I rented it because I recognized the title from \\"You've Got Mail\\". I watched it once and then bought it for my sister-in-law. I've never read the book.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I adore you, Indiana. But this is a stinker. The premise is... almost interesting.  I love sci-fi, so the X-Files aspect really should've turned my crank. Nuh-uh. Sure, Indy is older, charmingly flawed and far less super-human. It was nice to see Karen Allen again, but they only allowed her to be a middle-aged cartoon of her former sassy self. Cate Blanchett's dialogue coach should be 'disappeared' to Siberia. And editing. Good grief, what editing?  The ridiculously long chase scenes lacked any kind of tension or credibility (try to keep track of how that silly skull changes hands so many times in the big jungle chase). And perhaps the biggest annoyance was watching Shia LaBeouf go from a laughable Marlon Brando knock-off to a full-on swingin' in the trees Johnny Weissmuller. Oh, wait. Maybe it was the bizarre fight he instigated to cover their escape from the diner?  Or was it his car-straddling swashbuckling as his privates got abused by the shrubbery? It's not entirely Shia's fault, but WHEW! Stinky McStinkface.<br /><br />Friends of Indy: Add the first two Jones adventures to your home catalog and call it a day. This installment was a flagrant exercise in branding and merchandising, with no apparent love for the original product left to complicate things. Just a 2-hour commercial for the next big thrill ride at your favorite multinational theme park.  How sad.

B001MW0J2E|5.0|It's hard to imagine Animal Collective had anything like this in mind while creating their previous albums - this is an album of true progression and purity.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|***This review covers the Blu-Ray set***<br /><br />THE FILM<br /><br />A somewhat loose adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story, \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a half detective story, half sci-fi film.<br /><br />Blade Runner was probably one of the most expensive experimental films of all time.  It is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful, coming from a photographer, those words cary a good deal of meaning.  While as a story or even some of the performances,  dont always fire on all cylinders, there is a certain mystery and  powerful visual majesty to fill any lapses in dramatic pitch.<br /><br />Ridley Scott cut his teeth as a filmmaker on commercials and watching Jordan Cornenweth's powerful cinematography, one definitely feels Blade Runner is a sort of commercial.  For what, we just don't know.  Sure there are meditations on humanity, inevitability and choice, but there isn't a real cohesive exploration or dialogue on any of these subjects.  I think this ambiguity is probably the main reason Blade Runner has been such an  enduring journey.  For sure, there are genuinely tender, magical and powerful moments to the film.  In short, Blade Runner is what it is. It is a film that the viewer takes home what they bring to it.<br /><br />THE QUALITY<br /><br />I have owned several DVD and VHS releases of the movie through the years as many others and much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, this Blu-Ray release provs how lucky we are to have High Def.  On my 42\\" plasma, the film is rapturous.  The shafts of light and the blue hues really make you feel as if your peering into the world before you.  The blues are deep and the contrast is strong.<br /><br />There is grain and some missed focus, but the challenges the crew must have had shooting Panavision anamorphic in those days with such little light at times must have been a real challenge for the focus pullers.  If anything, on the grain, it only enhances the film's gritty feel.  Neither of these small observations have any real impact on the picture's quality or overall sharpness.<br /><br />Having upgraded to High-Def relatively recently, I have the same set for DVD and going back and fourth, there are some scenes that show a real hike in quality and detail.  This is one of those films where you watch it and aren't always conscious of the difference between HD and SD UNTIL you go back and watch the SD.  You really find it is impossible to go back. I'm glad I made the purchase.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />Like most great films, Blade Runner is not for everybody.  It is a supreme exercise in production and photography over drama, but that hasn't made the film any less powerful.  It was worth every penny to pick this up and it is easily one of the best releases you can get on HD right now.on the picture's quality or overall sharpness.

B000K09OL6|5.0|I'm a parent of a 13, 10 and 8 year-old. I've taught 4 year-olds in preschool. ALL ages (including me) love creating with this product! It really brings out the engineer in everybody in the most fun way possible. It may seem a little pricey, but Kapla is very worth it. The preschool teachers at my school would vie for the box and try to horde the blocks. I really can't think of a more versatile, and ageless, toy.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|For those of us who buy up almost everything gay, we know that there is a lot of crap out there posing as entertainment, and in all that, there are some gems: Latter Days, Beautiful Thing, Maurice, and now Shelter. Well acted, well written - just plain good. Unless you hate happy endings and insist that any good drama has to either end in the middle of an enigmatic scene (like most German and Japanese gay films I've seen) or in some sad, pathetic tragedy, I strongly suggest ordering Shelter immediately. It's a good lift with solid performances and quality cinematography. But most of all, it just feels so good.
B000PTYPAC|4.0|Musically speaking, there's not a whole lot of thinking outside the box here. Just radio friendly rock songs. But they change enough things to make it interesting throughout most of the album. This is an album that anybody who enjoys Rock music and isn't snobby enough to despise anything that gets any radio time(or don't get \\"indie cred\\") should enjoy. It's upbeat(musically), it's catchy, it's got good vocal, it's an album that you can listen the whole way through. Now I really can't see Paramore out doing this album in their future, but then again, I hope they surprise me.    For A Pessimist, I'm Pretty Optimistic 3/5  That's What You Get 5/5  Hallelujah 4/5  Misery Business 5/5  When It Rains 5/5  Let The Flames Begin 4/5  Miracle 4/5  Crushcrushcrush 5/5  We Are Broken 4/5  Fences 4/5  Born For This 3/5    *I have a fairly loose grading scale, 4/5 should be considered average and 3/5 acceptable.
B0011UCOGG|5.0|Brisingr is no question the best book in the series. Paolini has improved his writing a great deal since Eragon (not to say it was bad) and i can't wait to see what he writes after the Inheritance Cycle is completed. Sure this book may have a little too many conversations that drag on and more than its fair share of fights, but the truly remarkable and gripping sections more than make up for it. One such moment is the fight with th Ra'zac that happens within the first few chapters. So what if this book left more to be desired? That is why sequals were created. The story is an entertaining read and one of my favorites.   One of the best moments in the book is near the end when Arya kills the newly born shade and Oromis and Glaedr perish. It makes for a great combination of tragedy and victory. Another refreshing thing about this book are the chapters from Saphira and Glaedr's point of view. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a love for reading and of fantasy. The rating of 3 and a half stars is in my opinion unjust.

0596009208|2.0|I really did not care for this book.  I felt it was too scattered, not at all the way my brain works.  Also, I don't care for books that give non-real world examples.  This book uses the object of dog and methods such as bark, they could have just as well come up with real world examples of problems.  You might like it, but I suggest you find a copy at the library or book store and read through a chapter first to be sure it is up with your style of learning.
0452286751|5.0|The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand is a book that has changed my life by changing the ways I view others.  It's very hard not to categorize people as Howard Roark's and Peter Keating's after reading this book.  I love all of the political ideologies, and her philosophy of Objectivism is very clear and unambiguous throughout the novel.  I think it is much easier to understand what Objectivism really is after reading this book because it gives you real, human examples.  I also love the \\"love story\\" between Roark and Monique and how their whole relationship is built on hurt and tension.  Another thing I have also learned is that no one is really a true Howard Roark or Ellsworth Toohey, most people are just like Peter Keating.  But, I think in our country today we need someone like Howard Roark to do what's best and stop caring what everyone thinks.  I would recommend this book to anyone and it will definitely leave you thinking about the world and people once you are done reading it.
B000VDDWE2|4.0|First off, let me say that this movie is great.    Given its flaws, like the people in the library burning the books while the wooden chairs were there and wood burns longer, i think...but with all its flaws, the movie is still in my top 3 disaster films for all time.    The sad fact that there is more than 18 minutes of \\"deleted scenes\\" on the disc is what upset me the most.  If they had given some time (and budget) to finish the CG parts it would have been an awesome \\"alternate version\\".  I say alternate because of the scenes where Dennis Quaid was in the kitchen with his friend was totally different from the theatrical version.    Bottom line, buy the blu-ray disc....but the producers should have made an effort to shell out some dough to make the \\"alternate version\\" included to give it more distinction from the dvd version or any other version they come out with.
B000003EUL|5.0|When I was in high school, my piano teacher (Cortland Koontz of Due West, SC) recommended the Richter Brahms No. 2, and I think I listened to that LP fifty days in a row.  I only recently got the CD, prompted by a RCA Classics insert in a recording of Richter's Bach \\"Well-Tempered Clavier.\\" How gratifying to connect with the Richter Brahms again.  Other reviewers have commented in some detail about the performance, but I can only add that I've somewhat lost my enthusiasm for Brahms in recent years--overexposure, I guess--but this recording brings back the joy Brahms, and Richter, brought me when I was 17 years old.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|Gritty back to basics Western. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have great chemistry, and their interaction brings a good dose of humor to an otherwise grim story.  The action is spread out and abbreviated, but the tension does not let up through this nicely paced flick.
B000S5963Y|5.0|This is a truly brilliant album.  Not a weak song in the bunch.  Wait, not a song that is anything other than fantastic in the bunch.  I'd forgotten about these guys until a VH1 marathon on the 100 Best Hard Rock Songs.  I popped it in my CD, and oh my goodness, I was floored.<br /><br />I would definitely put this right up there with Appetite for Destruction and Dirt.<br /><br />Man, I'm so freakin' happy I found this again.  It's pretty  much been on an endess loop for the last 2 days.
0064430227|5.0|When I first opened this book I thought, \\"That's it?  Such simple drawings?  No bright colors?\\"  Then I read the book to my kids and they absolutely loved it.  They relate to the simple drawings and the boy in the story's wild imagination!  My kids even picked up their own crayons after we read the book and mimicked Harold.  This one is a winner at our house! [[ASIN:0981756522 Mommy's High Heel Shoes]]
B0014NDXGA|5.0|Fantastic.  The pin-seeker technology really works!  Not only does the V2 seek pins, with background, but also pins that are not easy to see, and from distances greater than advertized.  I've been able to range bunkers and the edges of greens as well.  Santa Clause really got this one right.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I remember seeing Toy Story that cold winter of 1995 and thinking, \\"This movie is great. We need more like this!\\" Thanks to John Lasseter and the rest at Pixar, we get a quality animated family film almost every year! Even at their worst, Pixar puts out more quality than other studios. And now the give us Wall-E. A story about a lovable little robot, left behind and forgotten about, who is just doing his job and getting through. His life gets exciting when Eve, a recon robot looking for life on Earth, shows up. A friendship ensues and adventure follows when Wall-E follows Eve back to a spaceship carrying what remains of the human race.<br />The human race has now become completely dependent on machines and robots for everything. When Wall-E, Eve and a sign of life on Earth show up, everything goes crazy!<br />This movie is sweet, emotional, funny and very smart. Not only does it make you care for a robot who barely says 5 words the whole movie, but it also has makes a commentary on both environmental issues and how we are growing more dependent on technology without being preachy. This is another winner from the wizards at Pixar!
0316743003|5.0|Growing up fascinated with airplanes and finding my way into aerospace engineering, this is the true story of the dream: a fun and challenging job of doing what hasn't been done.  Highly recommended for anyone, but especially young people wanting to do amazing engineering.  Rich offers some worthwhile advice near the end that is well illustrated by the rest of the book.
0385340990|4.0|Although I wondered where the book would go when I started reading it, I became deeply engrossed in the story, all the characters on Guernsey, and their connections through books.  Also, thought it clever how they threw the Germans off track by accidentally starting a literary society where the members had few books.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|Three memorable westerns have been made in recent years. [[ASIN:B001990LIC Open Range [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B000XRO3MQ 3:10 to Yuma [Blu-ray]]] and this movie. All are first rate cowboy movies with action and a great story. I consider 3:10 the lessor of the three because of the ending. I'd rate this up there with Open Range. Both Appaloosa and Open Range are top notch buddy flicks. Both tell stories of cowboy buddies that have known each other for years and are in a hard place and only have each other and themselves to get out alive. Both tell stories of cowboys with ethics, that do what is right. And both have a love story. And both stories show that buddies, no matter how long you have known them, there is still something you don't know about them.<br /><br />The two main things that people find wrong with Appaloosa are the casting of Renee Zellweger (which to some extent I agree with but can't think of anyone who might fit better) and the film drags at times. I don't think it drags at times, though some may. I think the casting of Jeremy Irons was a little off, not because of how he played his role, but because most know he is English and associate him as English, not as a western rancher. But he handles the role well.<br /><br />Overall, it is a GREAT western. I grew up on the spaghetti westerns of the 60s and 70s and think it is a great homage to those movies. When you watch the extras you find that there was total attention to detail even on a tight budget. They pulled off a masterpiece for a relatively small amount of money because Ed Harris got people he knew involved. The film really is a statement of what some great people in the motion picture industry think of Ed Harris. Its a great movie that anyone that enjoys westerns will enjoy.

1401216676|5.0|An incredibly intense graphic novel that was originally published in 1988, writer Alan Moore and artist Brian Bolland delve into the criminal mind through flashbacks on the \\"birth\\" of the Joker and a look at his sickening work to destroy Police Commissioner James Gordon and to bring Batman to his knees through a manipulative psychological battle.<br /><br />Commissioner Gordon is kidnapped by the Joker and taken to a dilapidated amusement park. There, he is forced to watch the heinous brutality administered to his daughter, Barbara, and forced to ride a gauntlet of terror which rips the heart to shreds.<br /><br />How the one-shot story ends is a classic gaze at the fine-line between good and evil, justice and revenge, sanity and insanity. The original artwork is bolstered by new coloring by Bolland.<br /><br />The story is a roller-coaster ride in emotions and is a powerful gaze at the shadows that haunt the soul of everyman.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|Beyond a doubt - my whole family agrees - this is the best of the brilliant Star Wars movies. In this excellent episode, Luke Skywalker finds a message in the family's new astromech droid, R2-D2. He attempts to do what it says, and, along with others, tries to bring the Death Star plans to the planet of Alderaan. Instead, he ends up rescuing Princess Leia, the leader of the Rebel Alliance (who is also his twin sister, though he doesn't know it). Luke blows up the Death Star and decides to join the Rebels.    If you haven't seen this movie already, do so at once. It's the original (and best) in the Star Wars Saga, after all! My sister says its the best because it revolves almost entirely around a kidnapping and a rescue. She says kidnappings are the most exciting things that can happen in stories. Everyone go watch this movie!
1401207529|5.0|This is a classic graphic novel that shows the brilliance of Frank Miller's writing and the incredible artwork of David Mazzucchelli.<br /><br />Originally published in the mid-1980s, the opening pages juxtaposes Lt. James Gordon arriving and Bruce Wayne returning to Gotham City, which is haunted by a corrupt police force and essentially open for plundering 24/7/365.<br /><br />As an early the description of Wayne explains, \\"He will become the greatest crimefighter the world has ever known...It won't be easy.\\" This is the start of a journey for Wayne and Gordon in a vicious venue where even the strong may not survive.<br /><br />There is also 40 pages of developmental material, which places the work in a solid historical context. Ultimately, it is a classic (new) look at the beginning, but with a style that fondly remembers this iconic story from the past.
B0002O7XVI|4.0|Tess of the D'Urbervilles is far from being my favourite Thomas Hardy book, but this film is not only a faithful adaptation, it touches your soul. Tess is a complex character, and she is brilliantly brought to life by Nastassia Kinski. She makes us feel alternately Tess's coldness and her attempts to melt, her desperate grabbing at love only to shun it, her inability to choose between the two men in her life, and her final realization that her true happiness does not lie on earth.  The movie does not only show Tess's inability to find happiness, but that she causes torment to the two men who love her. Each character is complex and human, not stereotyped and caricatured as it sometimes seemed in the book. The film's musical score is haunting and truly suits the mood of the story.      One interesting change the film makes is that, after Tess's father declares he doesn't want his children going begging, Tess is immediately shown on her way to the D'Urberville estate. In the book, she only goes after she kills the family horse, depriving them of income. Tess in the film is thus even more independent than in the book - this shows throughout the film.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I can't imagine what FUN Meryl Streep et al had making this movie. I'm 61 and would have paid them to be an extra!!! I've watched this 4 times since it's come out. I love dancing around the house to the music while I watch it again and again.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I wish I could give these all the stars in the galaxy! Star Wars is my absolute favourite movie in the universe, and this trilogy collection includes Episode IV: A New Hope, mine and my family's favourite episode.     The Star Wars saga contains almost every element one could wish for in a movie: action, romance, humour, suspense, interesting characters, good acting, wonderful creations and special effects. This trilogy tells the story of Luke Skywalker, his secret twin sister Leia, and the efforts they and their friends make to overhrow the evil Empire, which their own father helps run. I highly recommend any one of these movies to anyone who likes good, exciting films. After all, this is the greatest movie saga ever made!
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|Filmed in over a dozen different countries, the gloriously exotic \\"The Fall\\" begins modestly enough in a Los Angeles hospital in 1915 where a young movie stuntman lies paralyzed, the result of a stunt gone awry during the filming of a silent western.  Unable to leave his bed, Roy Walker strikes up a friendship with a 5-year-old fellow patient named Alexandria, a recent immigrant working in the local orange groves, who is recuperating with a broken arm.  To pass the time, Walker takes on the role of a modern-day Sheherazade, regaling his little companion with a tall tale of heroes and villains set in the exotic world of the ancient Near East.  Meanwhile, we discover that a more sinister motive may be lurking behind Walker's befriending of this innocent, trusting soul.<br /><br />\\"The Fall\\" is really two movies in one - the outer film, involving the storyteller and his listener, and the inner one dramatizing the tale Walker is recounting.  The former provides a sentimental and touching story of two hurting people from vastly different backgrounds who reach out to one another for friendship and support.  The story-within-the-story, on the other hand, takes a little getting used to, since at first it seems like nothing more than hokey, early-movie melodrama essentially unrelated to the two main characters at hand.  But then something truly miraculous occurs during the course of the film, as writer/director Tarsem Singh begins to meld his two seemingly disparate strands into a beautifully integrated and seamless thematic whole, blending realism and surrealism in a thoroughly unique and unceasingly imaginative way (the characters in Walker`s fanciful story are derived from the various patients and staff at the hospital).  Singh's mastery of color and design comes to the fore in this work, as he makes superb use of architecture, landscape, costuming, set decoration and cinematography to achieve his desired effects.<br /><br />Equally impressive are the quiet, intimate scenes set in the far more prosaic world of an infirmary where one of the characters has lost all will to live and the other has trouble differentiating fantasy from reality.  Lee Pace and first-time Romanian actress Catinca Untaru are simply wonderful together as the damaged man and the inquisitive child, with Untaru, especially, tearing at the heartstrings with her refreshingly natural and utterly unmannered performance.<br /><br />A glorious paean to the healing powers of imagination, \\"The Fall\\" is one of those movies that it is virtually impossible to describe to someone who hasn`t already seen it.  It truly must be experienced first hand to be understood and appreciated.  So without any further adieu, I recommend \\"The Fall\\" for your viewing pleasure.far more prosaic world of an infirmary where one of the characters has lost all will to live and the other has trouble differentiating fantasy from reality.

B001EN71DQ|5.0|The Star Wars movies are still the greatest ever made! How can you knock a movie series that has every single element required for a good movie? And this trilogy and the original trilogy combined have all the elements for a great movie! This trilogy tells the story of Anakin Skywalker training to be a Jedi but ending up turning to the dark side when he worries about his wife Padme's pregnancy. If you want to find out what happens to him (and his children) afterwards, watch the original trilogy. In my opinion, both trilogies are equally good and their stories are equally entertaining. Everybody run out and buy Star Wars movies!
B00000JPHD|5.0|Dracula is one hour and fifteen minutes long and released in theaters on February 12, 1931. The plot of this movie is that Count Dracula is packing up his coffin and is leaving Transylvania for England and is leaving behind his three brides; why his brides are left behind is never explained in the movie. Dracula takes up residency at Carfax Abbey and begins to rob people of their blood. Professor Van Helsing finds out that Dracula is now living in London and is enjoying the nightlife. Professor Van Helsing heads to London and finds out that Dracula is after the beautiful Mina Seward. Dracula wants Mina to be his living dead bride. Professor Van Helsing and Jonathan Harker track Dracula and Mina to Carfax Abbey. Jonathan is able to rescue his beloved Mina and Van Helsing kills Dracula until he is rising again in the House of Frankenstein. This is Béla Lugosi finest roll. Béla Lugosi would play Dracula in two more films: Mark of the Vampire and Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein. Dwight Frye plays an excellence believable Renfield; Dracula's slave. If nothing else some of the sex scenes, even though they are tame, are great. I am a big fan of the old Universal Studios monster horror films and this is one of the great ones from that era. Dracula gets an AAAAA+++++.
B00003CX5P|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, the second Star Wars episode I'd ever seen and the one in which it all begins. When Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn meets a young boy named Anakin Skywalker, the latter's thousands of midi-chlorians convinces the Master that he has found the Chosen One, the person destined to destroy the evil Sith Lords and bring balance to the Force. The Jedi Council refuses to train Anakin, but when the Sith Lord Darth Maul murders Qui-Gon, the latter has his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi make a deathbed promise to train Anakin. (Watch Episode II - Attack of the Clones to see the results of this!) A lot of the action of this movie also revolves around Queen Amidala (or is it really her servant, Padme) trying to free her planet Naboo from the Trade Federation. Don't hesitate!
B000S0GYRU|1.0|I bought this movie based on all the great reviews here at Amazon. I brought it to my brother's house for a bunch of us to watch. I told him that critics claimed \\"One of the scariest movies of all time\\" and \\"One of the most terrifying murders ever filmed\\". I will never live that down. What on earth were you people watching? This movie is not scary or suspenseful. The acting is terrible. The special effects are horrible (even for the decade it was made). I spent more time laughing at how bad this movie is than feeling any interest in what happened. If Amazon allowed it, I give this film minus stars. This film is 98 minutes of your life you will never get back.
B001LRJH0U|1.0|This movie had good elements that never came to fruition. It was really quite dull with little action. As soon as Zellweger came on screen with her million dollar facial plastic surgery failure, I knew the movie was doomed. I love both Harris and Mortenson, but not in this awful excuse for a western.
B000O77RLE|5.0|Most WWII movies always portray the Allied side of the conflict and we don't really see their point of view. Clint Eastwood has created a masterpiece here and has managed to portray a side of this conflict that really has never been discussed or shown before. I imagine that the violence was probably worse on both sides, but the point of the movie is that it condemns the concept of war. It shows that conflict does affect both sides and even the worst of enemies can have a family or has some type of humanity. I highly recommend seeing this movie to anyone that's a WWII buff or who wants to just see a great movie.
0316017922|5.0|In an era of economic chaos, meaningless rankings, and blind pursuit of fame and fortune, Gladwell's analysis of \\"success\\" in \\"Outliers\\" is in fact a simple and powerful reminder of each of our indebtedness to the struggles and sacrifices of those who came before us.      Just as important as our individual talents, creativity and perseverance are the opportunities others have provided us and the chances we have been fortunate enough to meet.  Gladwell reminds us that we must be as grateful for those realities that made real our achievements as we are proud of our individual efforts.  Such compassion, Gladwell hopes, would compel us to provide the best for our future and strive to give our children and grand-children the best chance for success just as our forebears have struggled to do so for us.    A must-read for anyone with a heart for human kind.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay, I have to get this out of the way. First off, the series is incomplete. The show was scheduled to run for 7 seasons and only made it through one (run out of order and only partly aired by Fox) before the network shut it down. After the DVD ends, you will still have a lot of questions about some of plot and the characters, particularly River and Shepard Book. Also, although originally billed as an action show, Firefly combines that with a drama - it's as if you bought a video game expecting Mortal Kombat and got Final Fantasy: the action, although not constant, is there, but so is a lot of intricate plot, which depending on your tastes can be good or bad.<br /><br />With that said, Firefly gets off to a fairly slow start, but when it finds its groove (depending on who you talk to, 2-4 episodes in) it really takes off. The ensemble works extremely well together, and the characters, while somewhat archetypal, are endearing and easily related to. The effects are pretty good, and the plots are believable and well-thought out. I especially like the creative camera use, which did many shots off-center or with flare. The commentaries and special features are nice touches, but the real gem of the DVD is the show itself.<br /><br />Sometimes really good shows don't make it. This is an example of one, and for all its unfulfilled questions, it is one of the greatest sci-fi series ever.

B000LXH11C|5.0|Wow! What can I say - I have every Alan Parsons album (in CD format), so I knew exactly what I was getting here. This is a fantastic collection of the most widely known APP material, and a few deeper cuts. In addition, the mastering is great and the sound quality is phenomenal.<br /><br />There is an interesting bonus to the last track \\"Standing on Higher Ground.\\" The song is longer than on the original album \\"Gaudi,\\" and it is fantastic. The song has a very upbeat and exciting ending, and in this version, you get to hear it go on for the length it should have in the first place. I am sure that on the original \\"Gaudi\\" album (which is terrific), the song was faded out sooner to fit everything in on the original vinyl version. The remastered version of \\"Gaudi\\" does include the longer version.<br /><br />The selection and sequence of tracks gives you material from each of the ten \\"The Alan Parsons Project\\" albums, in order of release. Track 11 on Disc 2 is a previously unreleased song, between the albums \\"Vulture Culture\\" (1984) and \\"Stereotomy\\" (1985). This collection was released in 2007, and represents APP albums released from 1976's \\"Tales of Mystery and Imagination\\" to 1987's \\"Gaudi.\\" Later material released under the name \\"Alan Parsons\\" (without \\"project\\") are not represented here, but I would not expect them to be. After Eric Woolfson left to pursue his solo career, Alan dropped \\"project\\" from the band's name.<br /><br />Alan Parsons' music has made a tremendous impact on me, and it was instrumental in helping me move out of a dark time. I discovered the amazing catalog of Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson album-by-album, but you cannot go wrong if you start with this collection. It may inspire you to dive deeper into the APP catalog. You will certainly find this music uplifting and thought-provoking, and perhaps even life-changing, as I did. Thanks for reading, and thanks to Alan Parsons, the late Eric Woolfson, and company for their inspiring music.
1878424505|5.0|The Four Agreements, based on ancient Toltec wisdom, is a powerful little book aimed at self-improvement and self-discovery. Don Miguel Ruiz reveals the source of self-limiting beliefs that rob us of joy and create needless suffering.<br /><br />These agreements are pretty simplistic:<br /><br />  * Be Impeccable With Your Word: Speak with integrity. Say only what you mean. Avoid using the word to speak against yourself or to gossip about others. Use the power of your word in the direction of truth and love.<br /><br />  * Don't Take Anything Personally: Nothing others do is because of you. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others, you won't be the victim of needless suffering.<br /><br />  * Don't Make Assumptions: Find the courage to ask questions and to express what you really want. Communicate with others as clearly as you can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness, and drama. With just this one agreement, you can completely transform your life.<br /><br />  * Always Do Your Best: Your best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when you are healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstance, simply do your best, and you will avoid self-judgment, self-abuse, and regret.<br /><br />I thought the book was very good; it gives the reader a lot to think about. I was left with a clear message: by ridding ourselves of negative thoughts and influences, we will find more peace and happiness in our lives.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Saw this in the theater the first time, and it is more than worth seeing again on Blu-Ray.  It was amazing!  So clear, so vivid, just wonderful.  I actually enjoyed it more at home, on this video, with all the wonderful extras.  Completely satisfied!
1595141715|2.0|Hype helps and hinders novels. It gets the word out and gets people excited. But it can make people too excited and hold the novel up to unrealistic expectations. I have never heard anyone say anthing bad about this novel. But, while I did like TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY in many was . . . In several ways I didn't. I recently told someone that the reread is very important to my internal scale - and I don't believe I will ever reread TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY.<br /><br />Here's reasons why:<br /><br />1. I like Clay. Clay's a sweetheart, the kind of guy I want to like me. He's easy to sympathize with. When he reaches his tape, I can barely stand it.<br /><br />I love this boy and he spends most of the novel needlessly tortured. Hannah, for all she made these tapes to force people to look at what they've done, never examines her own actions . . . which leads me to my second reason.<br /><br />2. I hate Hannah. She's not just cruel to Clay. She's perhaps most cruel to Mr. Porter. Without context he gets the burden of everything. He's just a high school teacher, not perfect, not even a counselor. Most of the people Hannah blames in her thirteen reasons, she seems to blame after she made her decision to commit suicide. She could have better served the world by telling these secrets openly rather than giving them to a few people after her death so that they can fester.<br /><br />TH1RTEEN R3ASONS WHY is built around an incredible premise. It's emotionally compelling. The story weaves around itself and pulls together in an examination of unintentional cruelty, unexpected consequences, and some of the darkest sides of human behavior. I found it torturous to read.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|I enjoyed \\"Salo\\" in the Criterion version very much. Yes, the sadism was difficult to watch, but nothing compared to the happenings in fascist Italy under Mussolini. As with most Criterion films the picture and sound quality is A+, as are the many commentaries and special features.    Luckily, I just took an Italian history course at a major university, so was well aware that the Nazis installed Mussloini in power in Salo after his government had fallen during the allies' invashion of Italy. While I understand this film was made for an Italian audience, I wonder how many Italians know about Mussolini's short second round of power. Without understanding the connect between fascism and De Sade, \\"Salo\\" is not much more than an non-erotic porn film.
B000XR49VQ|2.0|I purchased this from ''classics_vhs_dvd\\" and am rather disappointed at the image quality; the data is highly compressed (only 3.1GB for the whole movie!) and there are visible compression artifacts and audio hiss; no chapter markings, menus, or subtitles.  A real shame for such a visually detailed film!    It looks very much like a ripped copy burned onto a DVD-R, though the seller claims this is how it was originally released.  (Which seems likely to be true; I see a lot of complaints online about the quality of various DVDs produced by Allied Artists Classics.)    It's better than nothing, and no higher-quality version seems likely to come along any time soon... but it's sure not what I was hoping for.

The non verbal communication and especially the subtleties that tend to miss attention made me aware of the need to observe in rapt attention. The illustrations aptly convey the cue's to hidden limbic system. This book has immensely helped me to give maximum attention to people whom I interact daily and provided a better understanding of human behavior and the hidden message.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|For a non-speaking animated movie to make you cheer for the main character is quite an accomplishment. That's just what this movie does. It's totally entertaining and enjoyable. This is a movie for all ages. It may not hold the attention of small children because there is no talking. After a while they may be bored if they don't understand what's going on. However, for us older kids it's terrific!
B00000099Y|5.0|Out of all the Tool albums I personally think that this is their best one.  It shows their diverse talent as a band that flows from song to song.  This is one of few metal albums that can take your mind on a ride from the first song all the way to the last.  This will be an all time favorite of mine.  (Plus who else would make a track on how to make hash brownies in German haha)

0783225903|2.0|Some things just propel individuals to set up rival camps.  Wars, elections, abortion rights, and the cork versus screw-top wine bottle debate all result in humans absolutely convinced that their side is right and the other side is populated primarily by idiots.  The culture-wars spill over onto silver-screens as well, it seems, judging by the polarization of opinions regarding Terry Gilliam's (\\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\\") futuristic \\"Brazil.\\"  One opinion is that the movie is Gilliam's magnum opus, an achievement of such subtle and sublime genius that mere mortals can scarcely comprehend the tracings of meaning cascading from the screen into our tiny brains.  Another side proposes that the film is art tripe at its worst--a collective scream of multiple pseudo-intellectualizations gathered together underneath a veneer of unfunny comedic attempts and laughably infantile forays into modern political satire.  Few seem to inhabit the levels of the moderate judgment spectra.<br /><br />\\"Brazil\\" occurs in the future--well, a future in which the worst the 1970's had to offer persists ad infinatum anyway.  The film opens as a bored bureaucrat attempts to destroy an intruder which is interfering with his important job of supervising myriad automatic data-collection/dispersion devices.  The intruder, a fly, is killed and drops into one of the printing machines, resulting in a missive being sent out containing a collect-and-interrogate-and/or-kill order for one Mr. Buttle, instead of the real target, a Mr. Tuttle (Robert De Niro, \\"Goodfellas\\").  Governmental cronies, after realizing their unfortunate error, attempt amends by issuing a check to Mrs. Buttle as compensation.<br /><br />His story occurring in parallel to that above, Sam Lowry (Jonathan Pryce, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\") is an everyman stuck in the gears of a society which fails to entice him.  He is blessed with an upwardly-mobile mother who has contacts seemingly everywhere in government; however, this forces his progression in a society with which he has lost faith.  He is also cursed by that which is most dangerous to an ordinary worker-cog:  passion.  Vivid dreams plague him as he sleeps--in his sleep, he manifests as an avenging angel, complete with armor, wings, and sword.  He chases a beautiful maiden who is just out of reach while he simultaneously battles dream-enemies who seem a bit familiar.  These two forces have begun to rend his soul apart, and result in a fateful decision--he volunteers to deliver Mrs. Buttle's compensation check in person.  Reality and fantasy begin to mix freely in Lowry's mind after he witnesses the despondency of Buttle's widow, and he then embarks on a mad quest for freedom.  Unfortunately, the audience's perception of his fate becomes more clear with every second Lowry continues his geas.<br /><br />There are many ideas explored in this film; sadly, too few of them are sufficient enough, relevant enough, or original enough to warrant mentioning as novel.  Bureaucratic inefficiency via multitudes of paperwork designed to increase efficiency is ironic, but not necessarily funny, and is definitely not amusing when shown in \\"Brazil.\\"  The internal struggle between what one wants and what one is told they should want, eventually resulting in insanity, is dreary but not really new or even interesting.  The idea of government-condoned terrorism in order to foster an iron-gloved regime with the glowing seal-of-approval from the \\"safe\\" populace is something millennia old.<br /><br />Forget the lack of new ideas--few enough successful movies have anything new to offer, anyway.  \\"Brazil\\" lacks many more things, however.  The jokes are simply unfunny and repetitive.  The satire is equivalent to musings I overheard while drinking coffee with friends as we \\"studied\\" at the local Denny's twenty-odd years ago.  The love fantasy which propels Lowry into doom's embrace is simply unbelievable and totally without chemistry.  The film is also overlong and deadly boring in many places.  There are many great actors billed here--Palin, De Niro, Hoskins, Holm--but they are either miscast, acting below ability, or receiving too little screen time.<br /><br />*possible spoilers below*<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are bits of brilliance here and there.  I loved the concept of Tuttle being a terrorist simply because he wishes to work without having the bother of filling out monstrous piles of documentation.  The sadistic government handyman Spoor (Hoskins) and his multiple attempts to introduce misery into already-miserable Lowry's life provoked many a chuckle.  Michael Palin (\\"A Fish Called Wanda\\") as Jack Lint, Lowry's torturer friend, was a joy to watch throughout.  Especially amusing, in the vein of dark comedy, is when he exchanges his bloody medical garb for a clean change, all with his young daughter in attendance.  Finally, only two words are required for the last positive component:  Ian Holm.<br /><br />*end possible spoilers*<br /><br />In summary, this film instituted its original ideas poorly, and displayed its poor ideas as original.  Combined with a dearth of true entertainment value, an aimless plotline, a large helping of boredom, and only a sprinkling of really enjoyable ideas, \\"Brazil\\" really never had a chance.  It probably does not deserve its cult-classic status, mores the pity.  It is ironic that the repeated portrayal of irony itself was not sufficient to save this film.  This film is recommended only to die-hard Gilliams fans, and even then with several words of caution.There are many great actors billed here--Palin, De Niro, Hoskins, Holm--but they are either miscast, acting below ability, or receiving too little screen time.    *possible spoilers below*    Nevertheless, there are bits of brilliance here and there.

They hadn't grown up watching the cartoons, movies & Tv shows or reading the comic books but by the end of the film they knew all they needed to know about The Caped Crusader.<br />Oh it  was epic. I didn't have a problem with Batman's voice. It was true to cannon. I loved this movie.
B0017HEYAM|3.0|If you are a fan of Fernando, this DVD is interesting for its historical value, as very little of his recorded dancing is available commercially.  This particular piece has numerous flaws, choreographic, dramatic, and technical.  The latter are the most irksome for the casual viewer.  The color is a washed-out sepia in the first act, and the second act is danced in near-pitch darkness.  The sound is muffled, and the orchestra is sub-par.  Bujones is enjoyable to watch, but male dancing has progressed so much in just the last two decades, one would almost think he is a talented but unpolished amateur at a graduation performance.

B001GH5LM8|5.0|Metal heads must be delighted by this very Metallica-like work by the kids from Central Florida.   I'm so impressed that our little county here in Fla. could spawn such quality metal music.  I only regret not seeing them while they were playing local clubs.  But yeah for them touring with Slipknot-can't wait.    So why buy this CD-well that's simple, dense, pummeling, riffs circling intricately around guitar solos and clean and growling vocals all set in front of a somewhat melodic outer-worldly sound.  They managed to write songs that are jammed pack with changes from riff/riff/growl/sing/solo/break/again.... and so on at an almost dizzying speed.   I would almost describe their metal style as somewhat symbolic of the new millennium, extremely fast and exhaustingly energetic and even taking elements from many other styles including some gaming influences.      I really appreciate the more rhythm bound metal sound that has just a hint of metalcore and some other styles.   That cross-over effect is ever so slightly present in Shogun.  Just enough so metal-heads won't freak out, and the rest of us metal fans can bop to the catchy beats.     I have yet to pick up their second release-Ascendancy, but the professional reviews are so stellar, that I will buy it very very soon.   Reviewers are saying that Shogun is even more ambitious and several metal blogs are considering this Shogun as one of the top albums of 2008 even though it fell short of many of the final lists.       Highlights:     Down from the Sky-The clean vocal portion of the chorus (with a hint of metalcore) sticks with you and you are singing it for hours, almost like the more radio-friendly songs.  Don't let the anthemy opening fool you, this track gets raw with a dark growling menacing breakdown that is sure to please any mosher.     Throes of Perdition-Right from the opening riffs you can feel the pulsing vibe provided by this track. Again I am a sucker for the clean vocals, gosh growling just gets so old, but this track repeatedly alternates between both, again with a clean chorus that you find your self singing for hours.   This is that track that you remember when you wake up in the morning and think, gosh I have to get Trivium on right away.  I'm a huge fan of groove thrash (Five Finger Death Punch) and this track really hits the spot.    Shogun-Title track always deserves a mention, the Metallica influences seem very evident to me here.  In fact for a couple of moments at the opening I think I'm listening to James Hetfield. The song moves quickly toward an epic anthemy feel, if I were making predictions I would say this track foretells the direction this band will head. It's inevitable that a group this talented will not remain contented with standard metal growls and dark vacant tones

B001GCUNVW|5.0|Impressed by Mickey Rourke's Golden Globe winning speech, I decided to go see this movie.<br /><br />Randy 'The Ram' Robinson fought the Ayatollah in Madison Square Garden back in the 80s, and still battles today. Ill met by fate, bruised and battered, his sinewy muscles scarred, his bones creaking in protest he still has the fight, and like a One Trick Pony he sticks to what he knows.  It's a desperate life.<br /><br />As you may recall in Raging Bull, Robert De Niro put on about 40 pounds to play fighter Jake La Motta as he got older, and he won an Oscar for his dedication to the role.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke does something no less astounding here, putting on huge bulk to assume the persona and convincing physique of a professional wrestler.  It's the most amazing acting performance of the year.  The lines between actor  and character blur and disappear.  The kind of pain you see on Randy's face cannot be pretended. It can only be relived from the actor's parallel experience, which is what makes Rourke's performance so compelling.<br /><br />For female companionship, he goes to a local bar, where a fetching stripper played by Marisa Tomei, Academy Award winner for My Cousin Vinny, gives him a lap dance for a fee.  He can barely make rent, yet he has priorities.<br /><br />Marisa gives an incredibly authentic performance, and it's a welcome surprise see her take it off in the name of art.  I applaud her courage in doing so.  Her physique is simply amazing, and her body art is very intriguing.<br /><br />Evan Rachel Wood plays his estranged daughter.  Previously, she played the female lead part in Across The Universe, and already has a quite impressive filmography under her belt.  Here she sports a different look, and gives a perfect performance.<br /><br />Some of the wrestling sequences are truly outrageous, and not a little disturbing.  Having cut my finger on a ham slicer early in life, seeing people operating ham slicers gives me the heebie jeebies.  If you have a problem with the sight of blood,  I caution you that there are some disturbing sequences in the movie.<br /><br />The Academy's actor awards tend to go to actors in two types of role:<br /><br />1.Psychopath- No Country for Old Men, The Usual Suspects, There Will Be Blood, Training Day, Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />2.Mentally Disabled, Social or Physical Handicap, overcomes great adversity or discrimination- Shine, As Good as It Gets, A Beautiful Mind, Ray, Scent of a Woman, Capote, Philadelphia, The Pianist, A Beautiful Life.<br /><br />Randy definitely has a handicap, and last year was the year of the psychopath, with both Daniel Day Lewis, and Javier Bardem winning Oscar.<br /><br />I hope you find this helpful.that there are some disturbing sequences in the movie.

1439136653|4.0|When the reader is introduced to Ram Mohammed Thomas, he is being interrogated, accused of cheating on a game show similar to \\"Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.\\"  Due to his economic background and the fact that he isn't educated in the traditional sense, his accusers can only assume that he somehow found a way to cheat the system.  However, when a lawyer comes to his defense and asks for his side of the story, along with their viewing of the tape of Thomas' specific episode, Thomas takes the reader on a journey on how he answered each question.<br />The narration in this book was superb and each chapter flowed smoothly.  Thomas introduces us to a world where one must possess street smarts in order to survive, and at the end of the day, it's everyone for his/her self.  Each chapter represents a question, along with its rupee amount, and the experience that Thomas went through in order to figure out the answer.  In fact, what I loved about this book was that Thomas used the things he witnessed and experienced in life to answer the questions on the show.  I thought it helped the plot too in that he did not come from a background of privilege, and in instances where his dreams are shattered, I too felt his pain.  [\\"X Gkrz Opknu (or a Love Story)\\" was especially heartbreaking.]  I also appreciated that the characters were developed and came full circle.  Swarup made every one of his characters count, and there wasn't a character that was created only to be wasted in the book.<br />Read this book if you want a fast paced, sweeping story that shows us that underdogs do have their moment.
B001F12J48|5.0|\\"The Polar Express\\" is an amazing Christmas family movie and is little different than any other Christmas movie out there. It focuses on children who are in their crucial year, and who are on the verge of forgetting how magical Christmas really can be.     As a result, they decide to go on a magical train ride that not only will bring them to the North Pole to meet Santa, but also will teach them some very valuable life lessons along the way, one of which is to \\"believe\\".    Tom Hanks is just outstanding, and his ability to transform from one character to another is flawless.     The 3-D Blu-Ray version of this movie is just as good as it will ever get. I have literally watched this movie over a 100 times, and it will never get old.
0316017922|5.0|Having read all of Gladwell's popular titles I see the continuation of his endless quest for the answer to \\"why\\". The book combines the right amount of mystery, fact, and analysis. There are no life changing outcomes here if you already understand much of life is who you know. The book helps explain why you know who you know and how the systems that humans have created serve to keep your \\"who you know list\\" quite limited. Overall, the text makes sense and adds another conversation point for social gatherings or filling time before a meeting.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I've always been a quasi-Kings fan, but this album has sealed my faith in this band. It took only a day for me to fall in love with this album and I have been playing at least one song everyday since i bought it. This album is great. One of my top favs already
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Alanis Nadine Morrissette is back with her first all-original album since 2004's SO-CALLED CHAOS. The Canadian-born Grammy-winner delights fans with 11 pleasant-sounding tracks like UNDERNEATH,INCOMPLETE,CITIZEN OF THE PLANET and VERSIONS OF VIOLENCE. Now,will this effort earn Morrissette any Grammy nominations at least? She took home several Grammys for her 1995 debut smash JAGGED LITTLE PILL. If you love JLP,SUPPOSED FORMER INFATUATION JUNKIE,UNDER RUG SWEPT and SCC,you'll love this album. I know I will.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My husband, 7 year old daughter and I enjoy this movie. There is very little speaking in the movie (especially the first 50 minutes!) so, attempting to watch and do something else is not a good idea.    I would recommend this movie for children and adults.
B001GQACGO|5.0|The standard edition of this album is a 2 CD set with eleven tracks(6 on the first disc and 5 on the second disc). Why just pay for the standard edition when you can get all sixteen tracks on this deluxe edition for only a couple of dollars more? I sure got my money's worth. Destiny's Child alumnus Beyonce Knowles gives her fans sixteen well-performed tracks like IF I WERE A BOY and SINGLE LADIES(PUT A RING ON IT).
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|My daughter (who is 7) and I love this movie. It is very well created and has light fun humor in it. I would recommend this movie to all ages.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I cannot wear ear buds, I can't wear the kind with ear hooks.  I've been looking for this lightweight mini style in stores, but with no luck.  My old pair from the 80's were getting pretty worn out, so I am glad to get the newer version.  They adjust well and have good sound with my mp3 player. I have a very active job: crawling, climbing ladders, faux finishing ceilings and walls and painting murals, so I need a pair of headphones that will stay on all day.  They are very light and comfortable.
B0019T9FL6|1.0|I found her album to be extremely amateur sounding, the only song that was decent was Spotlight and I initially got the album because I heard that single. I highly doubt any other real singles can be pulled off of this album.
0439813786|5.0|Absolutely glorious black and white drawings are interspersed between the pages of text to create a first rate classic.  Brian Selznick has written a simple, yet touching story of an orphan who finds his true calling as a magician.<br /><br />In order to reach that end, Hugo Cabret must suffer the indignity of having to steal to survive, must work at a job he hates, and must finally face his fears.  Through it all, Hugo pursues goal to restore the mechanical man that his late father found and was repairing prior to his death.  In doing so, Hugo helps the toymaker (who is actually a great film maker and the mechanical man's creator) receive the recognition which he deserves.<br /><br />This is a book that anyone who enjoys a good story will love.  The black and white line drawings remind one of Maurice Sendak's work.  The story is simple enough to be read aloud to younger children; it is a classic work from a simpler time.  The drawings actually tell the story as well as the words; one can almost imagine this book as an old fashioned picture book.<br /><br />I'm not sure that the age group for which \\"Hugo\\" is recommended will enjoy the book, only because it is a somewhat old fashioned story without wizards, fantasy, or evil beings.<br /><br />If you have a child you love, or if you are a child at heart then you will definitely want to add this book to your collection.
0451450523|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It is shameless fantasy, and a great book for a teen, great for an adult, great for men, great for women. It's just great!    The heroes of the story are all fallible heroes - Schmendrick the magician is a bit of a schmuck, and Lir the prince is a bit of a sad sack (at least at the beginning), and Molly is plainly a bit common - except for the unicorn. She is a unique and special thing, and brings \\"specialness\\" to everyone and everything that enters her sphere of influence. The message? No matter how hopelessly dull anyone may be, uniqueness is within.    The book is beautifully paced and balanced, with episodes that contain plenty of action, but with plenty of opportunity for bits of poetry in between. It has many lyrical stretches, but these are balanced by many wryly comic scenes and sardonic observances. It is obsessively readable, and even obsessively re-readable. It has been loaned out more than any other book I own.
B00005N5S5|4.0|For those who haven't seen it yet, the first Terminator movie is an awesome thriller about a rampant cyborg sent to terminate Sarah Conner.<br /><br />It's a classic movie story that so many people remember. A mysterious cyborg is sent 40 years into the past to kill Sarah Conner. Sarah is the mother of John Conner, the future leader of humans who would lead the revolution against the evil robot empire of DynaNet in the future. Kyle, one of the revolution soldiers, is sent 40 years in the past to protect Sarah.<br /><br />It's an awfully simple plot, and the Terminator, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger, is a mindless killing machine who can smash his hands through windows, crush bones and shoot shotguns and machine-guns from motorcycles. \\"The Terminator\\" is pretty intense, with guns and explosions peppered through the movie.<br /><br />This is a memorable film for Sarah Conner actor Linda Hamilton, who would later play the futuristic law enforcer, Robocop. And the love story is surprisingly compassionate. While we've all seen the masochistic male terrorist with weapons of mass destruction many times before, this is one of the first films in which the heavy-duty robotics to help humans in the post-modern world turns against humans to apparently start a wicked apocalypse.<br /><br />Michael Biehn also does a splendid job as Kyle Reese, the no-holds-barred guy who provides most of the dialogue. Ladies will no doubt swoon when they see his steamy sex scene with Sarah. And his flashbacks (or flash forwards?) of his life in the future are pretty dramatic, portraying a post-war slum world of burning oil drums, filthy streets and starving humans.<br /><br />Of course, director James Cameron was probably better known for that film with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the one of the corniest romances ever made in the history of cinema. But \\"The Terminator\\" was a great start, with minimalist special effects and hard-hitting drama. And yes, the animatronic robot in the end sequence is somewhat primitive nowadays, but he still is pretty damn scary.but he still is pretty damn scary.
074356619X|5.0|It's imperative than every single person in the world buy a copy of this. It's an essential manual to navigate through life successfully. I would recommend this to the whole world ! ! ! The narrator has a most soothing voice, it's calming to listen to her. And all the other contributors were great too. I especially loved Lisa Nicols. If I lived in the US, I'd attend all of her sessions. Buy it, you've got to have it, you know you want it!!!
1582701709|1.0|We don't exist in a vacuum.  While I'm sitting here wishing and bending the universe to do my will, billions of others are doing the same, some in direct opposition to my wishes.  We all interact constantly, and this idea of a linear progression of our thoughts, of our spiritual desires, is absurd and overly simplistic at best, and at worst adds fuel to the fire of those that believe people, and entire countries of people, who find themselves on the bottom of the human pile are there because they have created the situation for themselves, i.e. it is their fault.  The world, the universe, does NOT occur in a vacuum, and we are not all born into equal circumstances  when we arrive here on this planet.      Beyond this facet of this book's horridness, I would say the most disturbing thing I find about \\"The Secret\\" phenomena is that it sells itself as a revolutionary or \\"evolutionary\\" product when in fact it is anything but.  We are supposedly given the keys to make all of our wishes and desires come true, without any question or focus on why we have these desires in the first place, whether they are aligned with any type of true spirituality, or the real nature of happiness.  In short, people think they are being so cutting edge, but all they are being is indulged, and end up perpetuating a way of being in the world that is unsustainable and unhealthy.
B000024LX9|1.0|Sounds crappy. Would rather buy all the studio releases and be content. I wanted to sell mine or trade it 15 minutes after I had it. There's better Richie B. out there if thats what your after. I play guitar and was looking for something scorching but this was not it. Spend your cash on something else.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|As someone who spends more time than most in southern France, I was excited when this movie came out. I do not feel disappointed. It looks lovely, and conveys the beauty and spirit of Provence quite nicely. The acting is good, and although not exactly original, the story moves along and provides a laugh or two. Like living in France, let yourself be immersed, and accept that the purpose of this movie is to allow you to experience another way of life. And do so with a glass or two of Cote du Rhone, a loaf of crusty bread and some nice soft Brie.<br /><br />And Fox, how about putting this out on Blu Ray?
B001NB1OSC|5.0|Surprisingly relevant, and incredibly durable, Achtung Baby might be the only album you'll ever need. Why? It's got the soul, it's got the depth and it's got the heart to keep you company through almost any season of life.     This album was a defining achievement for U2, and for all of us- it was the first time in a long time a band has truly recreated themselves. Instead of the manufactured garbage that comes out in most follow-up albums, U2(which was on the brink of breaking up during the production of Achtung Baby), looked inward and found some of the best music the industry has known.     And amazingly people let them succeed! Somehow the band convinced all of us that a band can break out of the mold in which it's cast(ie Joshua Tree). I've had this album for almost 15 years and probably the best Rock & Roll I've ever heard.
B000RZJB0I|3.0|Although DN is praised as one of the greatest early alternative records and Sonic Youth's finest moment, I always felt that it was one of those albums praised more for the unhinged distortion it potently represented than actual songwriting content. Albums later on would incorporate melody more successfully without compensating their trademark production edge.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Back when grey's was fresh it was an enjoyable show with different types of characters.  There was humor and unexpected hookups.  The show hasn't been able to maintain the level of humor and has tried to force relationships upon characters with no chemistry.  In the beginning though it made sense.  Who  thought the cold and calculating Christina would become close friends with the whiny Grey and then hook up with Burk?  The cast is also racially integrated, but the character's personalities are what drives their characters, not race.  Wake up networks.  Integration is a good thing.  Anyway the first 2 seasons are the best of the series.  After that it becomes inconsistent.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|I feel I should give a disclaimer before anyone reads this review.  I love to hate this movie and hate to love this movie.  I can recall seeing this movie as a child growing up and thinking it was pretty cool.  Then many years went by and I had totally forgotten this film.  About five years ago this movie was played every single night during the summer on HBO or Showtime.  So I watched this movie with an older and more matured pair of eyes.  This resulted in a different viewing experience.  The following review is somewhat insidious and is deliberate in its caustic tone.  Nevertheless, \\"The Karate Kid\\" is still such a guilty pleasure for me and a classic film in its own right.<br /><br />I don't know where to start or stop in this movie. This motion picture captures all the 1980s staples: hair, music, fashion and dumb behavior that only transpires in a teenage film from the 1980s. All I know is I am glad Daniel LaRusso got his face kicked in the entire movie. He was the underdog I really didn't care about. As a matter of fact, I don't understand how an Italian teenager from Newark, New Jersey kept getting his butt kicked by a California teenage punk (named Johnny) riding a motorbike and wearing some red jacket.  This California teenage punk is played by none other than William Zabka, who was the staple villain of teenage cinema in the 1980s.<br /><br />As for Daniel's background, I feel strongly that Daniel was a bastard, you know born out of wedlock.  I believe his mother was the \\"other woman\\" and this was the reason that only \\"Daniel and his mother\\" moved from New Jersey to California.  I don't buy that explanation that his mother \\"found a better job\\", this is hogwash. This is only my theory. Consequently a theory is only a theory and not a fact but can result in a following that can morph public opinion and over time become the truth.<br /><br />Look for a young Elisabeth Shue playing Ally (with an I, hence Ali). Ali is the estranged ex-girlfriend of Johnny (a California teenage punk riding a motorbike and wearing some red jacket). I digress, I like when Ali tells Daniel that her name is \\"Ali with an I\\" and Daniels says his name is \\"Daniel with an L\\". What a moron.  Another \\"rock star\\" moment brought to you in part by Daniel LaRusso is how pleased he was when he beats Ali in a game of Air Hockey, while they are on their first date.  And what was up with Daniels wardrobe?  He deserved having the tar beat out of him.  Did I mention that Elisabeth Shue, I mean \\"Ally with an I\\" was totally hot in this movie?<br /><br />We all know that Mr. Miyagi is Yoda personified.  So no need to demonstrate the courtship of tautology on this tidbit.  I would have to say my favorite part of this film is when Daniel is force down a huge hill while on his bike, by Johnny (the Cali teenage punk) and his gang.  Once Daniel \\"wipes out\\" so to speak, he throws his bike away.  You read this correctly, he throws his bike away as if it was his bike's fault. What's that about?<br /><br />Once Daniel starts learning karate and stick up for himself the movie becomes rather humdrum.ding a motorbike and wearing some red jacket).

B001K98MFU|5.0|I will skip the movie review there is plenty of those,I will say if you haven't seen it your missing out the visuals are amazing and the score is terrific.No,you don't have to watch the first Ghost in the shell or the TV series to follow this one but it helps in some spots.First I want to point out to the reviewer \\"orangekay\\" no the film takes no longer than other bluray to load and yes you can pull the menu up while watching the film.I believe you either have a bad copy or more likely need to update your bluray player's firmware.To watch this I used a Sony 350 player with firmware up to date.I don't like to comment on other's reviews but just wanted people to know and hopefully you read this so you don't miss future features on bluray titles.Ok here's the business part the video is good I wouldn't call it something special but it is an upgrade from the past dvd release,most noticeably the colors are nice and vibrant and the picture is sharp.Now this is most important SO READ THIS PART!!! I rarely if ever watch a film or anime dubbed in English but i thought I would give a shot and just be able to completely admire the incredible visuals,but as I switched to English dubbed from the original Japanese I noticed a huge drop in audio clarity from the musical score and a huge,huge difference in the surround and sub woofer or LFE.Although both are list as Japanese 5.1 and English 5.1 the difference between them are like the Japanese 5.1 is in DTS and the English dubbed is in 2.0 stereo.When and if you get this do a little back and forth checking yourself if you don't fully believe me,this is the main reason I felt I had to review this bluray.So enjoy and remember to check the the audio difference between the different tracks.

B00005QW5X|5.0|I didn't think I'd like it...  Trans-sexual rock opera?  Sex Change?  Etc>?    It is amazing.  Best modern musical movie I've seen.  Pulls you in and touches your heart.  Awesome soundtrack as well.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|As an owner of Show of Hands, Rush in RIO, and R30, the BD version of this concert is incredible. While the concert itself was the reason for purchasing this DVD, I thought the introduction videos & \\"what's that smell\\" videos etc. were hilarious. If Alex ever quits his day job, he would do very well in comedy.  The outtakes are so funny, my kids even laugh out loud.  If you are a fan of Rush, I promise you that this is the best quality DVD ever made by the band and the sound is awesome.  You will be impressed.
141694740X|5.0|What can I say other than this should be required reading for anyone who wants to understand relationships.  If you have friends, family or acquaintances who don't resect you or your boundaries, this little book will help you understand what may be going on with \\"them\\" and not take it personally.  Life is waaaay to short to be attached to men/people who don't deserve to be your friend.<br /><br />Just my opinion, of course.<br /><br />GMH - Houston, TX
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I couldn't give this series a perfect 5, although I would have liked to.  The images are spectacular.  I am a HUGE nature and photo buff and documentaries are right up my alley.  I love the variety of content in this series.  You get information and vivid imagery from every corner of the globe.    The flaw that keeps this series from receiving a 5 star is that, in spite of the fantastic picture quality, there is a lot of posterization or some type of transfer issues.  This is mostly noticeable on dark scenes.  These issues take away from the series just a bit, but Planet Earth is  still worth the money paid as you will enjoy the series over and over again.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|Great album, every song is amazing. The band has done what so many veteran rockers rarely achieve- combining the best elements of their \\"classic\\" era with fresh, inspired songwriting. You can feel the passion in this album. Play this as loud as you can, and just let it take you. Highly melodic at times, and always fired up, the 3-guitar lineup of Murray, Smith and Gers has never before gelled like this, it's all come together perfectly on \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\". The lyrics always tell a good story. The live feel and sound of this cd is a bonus, at times it sounds like you are there in the same room with them. It's raw (unmastered), but not too raw- it's just right. This is easily Iron Maiden's best album since \\"Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son\\". Despite any style this album may be labeled as, it all comes down to the song. Every song here is brilliant, regardless of style. Favorites for me are \\"The Pilgrim\\", \\"Lord Of Light\\", \\"The Legacy\\", and \\"Brighter Than A Thousand Suns\\". This will rock you like nothing ever before! Using words and reviewing this album could almost cheapen the experiece, but just if this influences someone who loves good hard driving heavy metal to buy it, and listen to it, it's worth it.   Long Live Iron Maiden.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|I was very excited to get the new Coldplay CD for Christmas.  First of all I will compare it to the other 10 cds I got this Xmas and Viva La Vida is by far my favorite CD so it compares well to the best of what is currently out there.<br /><br />Now for the cd itself, it was billed as a break from the \\"typical\\" Coldplay formula.  I did find it to be only slightly more edgy than the previous albums.  The songs were all pretty catch and enjoyable.  My only complaint was that the cd seems to be very short.<br /><br />I would recommend this cd to all Coldplay fans and to anyone else wanting to try out something new.
B000W1AOHG|5.0|Nick Drake's debut album from 1968, named for the notice found in packages of English cigarette rolling paper, was produced by the great Joe Boyd and included Fairport Convention's guitarist Richard Thompson and Pentangle's amazing double bass player, Danny Thompson. He was a contemporary of Sandy Denny who was also produced by Boyd on the same Island label. Some of the Five Leaves string arrangements were done by Robert Kirby, then a music student, who recently did the same for Teddy Thompson's (Richard's son) \\"country\\" CD, Up Front and Down Low, some 40 years later. Five Leaves fell through the cracks in 1968 but still sounds good today. Daniel Martin Moore has released a new album Stray Age which has some of the characteristics of a Drake album, and Moore covers a Sandy Denny song Who Knows Where the Time Goes. Without Drake, would we have had either Elliot Smith or Daniel Martin Moore? Forget the suicide angle. Drake was very much alive in 1968. Enjoy his and Joe Boyd's handiwork. Nick Drake is STILL very much alive.

B0000033OT|5.0|It is a couple days after the 30th anniversary of the fallen Sphinx. This was is 1st Solo Album and it shows his true essence. It shows his hunger, his grace, and how excellent he was a musician. For any aspiring soul singer, this is a must have. You have to study this album.
0545128285|2.0|As a Harry Potter fan, Tales of Beedle the Bard is a disappointing read. The book contains five very short, short stories: \\"The Fountain of Fair Fortune,\\" \\"The Wizard and the Hopping Pot,\\" \\"Babbity Rabbity,\\" \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart\\" and \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers.\\"     The book is 110 pages but could have been printed on 40 - 50 pages. The stories average less than 2,000 words each and there are only around 10,000 words in the book itself. Understandable in a book penned as a gift, an add on. Not understandable in a book being sold in a $100 collector edition.    The stories themselves aren't bad. They are written in Jo's familiar style, albeit for a young audience, the audience Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was first intended for, but not the audience for the later books which are so much darker and so much more mature. Jo's pen doodles are a nice touch. Having said that, I'm not sure I can recommend this to anyone but the most die-hard Potter fans.
1582701709|1.0|These books regularly reinvent themselves every so often.  A pseudo scientific take on a non-scientific principle...the \\"law\\" of attraction.  As if this is a physical dictum by virtue of it's misnomer. Almost sounds like one of Newton's laws of motion.  Here is the real secret:  There is no \\"law\\" of attraction.  Period.    Your success in life is a culmination of thought, desire, planning and oh yeah...ACTION.  Wishing, wanting, dreaming, longing for, hoping, affirming, praying, meditating, thinking and wondering your way to success is the realm of fools.    Napoleon Hill first wrote of the \\"secret\\" in his bestseller \\"Think and Grow Rich\\".  Who got rich?  Napoleon Hill.  Read it, then get off your rear end and DO something.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|My December is a diamond in the rough!  It is a shame that this album had such negativity surrounding it because it is truely a gem!  Sober should have won a Grammy or at least been nominated.  Clarkson's song writing is superb!  You can tell she put every ounce of emotion she had into the lyrics.  They are deep, personal and meaningful!  She doesn't get the credit she deserves and it is upsetting!

B00004TH6O|5.0|A follow-up to their first major full-length release, this is the last solid, creative, f_ck th industry QOTSA record. Songs for the deaf and anything thereafter is an obvious atempt at coperate success, but this record has the rawness and creativity that I loved Queens for. The songs are all solid, and they all paint great imagry in the listeners mind. get this and the first self-titled release for sure, that is all you need from this band.
B000FT9KYI|5.0|I read the 1 star reviews to see what the problem was. The complaints were that it was \\"unrealistic\\" that the characters were not \\"believable\\", the plot was loose and jumped around a lot etc. NO S--T! These irregularities are what makes the movie funny. The way he eats and drinks, throwing that button and running away, the delicious bass... So many hilarious subtleties. I really think these folks have a limited sense of humor. Humor has to slap some people in the face, unfortunately.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|The last time I watched my two favorite iconic actors was in the blockbuster hit \\"HEAT\\" and of course, I was drawn to director Jon Avnet's \\"RIGHTEOUS KILL\\"--although, I was keeping my expectations really low (after amazon friend Chris Blackshere`s review). The film has a very interesting premise and has the makings of an effective police drama, unfortunately the screenplay by Russell Gerwitz appears to have been hampered by a \\"gimmick\\" in the form of a video taped confession.<br /><br />Turk (Robert De Niro) and Rooster (Al Pacino) are two cops, with a 30 year service to the NYPD. These two detectives have a lot of experience and have seen a lot of things in their career. Turk actually has some anger management issues and Rooster is just full of \\"cool\\". The two are teamed up with another pair of detectives, Riley and Perez (Donnie Wahlberg and John Leguizamo respectively) from another unit to investigate the killings of several \\"scumbags\\" who are still out on the streets because of technicalities in court. These killings seem to be the work of a vigilante roaming the city streets who leaves poetry after each kill. There is some tension between Turk and Perez, Turk is currently a forensic scientist's (played by sexy Carla Gugino) \\"whoopee\\" buddy and Perez has a history with her. The four detectives find themselves in a collision course as Riley and Perez names Turk as the suspect. All the evidence points to Turk--or does it?<br /><br />First of all, I love Pacino and DeNiro so it is such a treat to see them interact within the same camera view for such a good period of time. (they had limited interaction in \\"Heat\\") These two men are iconic actors and they can carry any film to no end. You just look at the actors and their presence just commands attention. Their characters \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Turk\\" are somewhat compelling and complex, they are very interesting, so at least both Pacino and DeNiro have something to work with. Pacino is the one who is level-headed while De Niro is the hot-headed one; also quite an unusual parallel to Wahlberg's Riley and Leguizamo's Perez. I suppose it was an attempt for Avnet to express the familiar mechanics of the \\"good cop, bad cop routine\\". Quite stereotypical, but with Pacino's and DeNiro`s performances, one doesn't necessarily need to be original.<br /><br />The script does have a good plot, decent set ups, complex characters but what really hurt the film is its predictability. The film's main gimmick with \\"Turk\\" on videotape confessing in the first act just ruined everything for me, it became so predictable and I solved the \\"mystery\\" before the first half. For a movie like this, the serial killer-vigilante's identity have to be meticulously hidden so the viewer can be immersed into the proceedings--the style is just a cheap trick to try and interest the audience. Ok, I tried to justify the videotaped confession by thinking that the film is mostly about friendship, duty and trust; I honestly did try to get over the thriller elements but the directing and editing just kept me from buying this film as a morality play. I cannot go any further without spoiling the film for anybody, but to make things short, the direction was depending on misdirection on the screenplay and some ineffective twists for it to be accepted as one. Too bad, a few efforts in the editing room would have put this film into the list of effective cop dramas.<br /><br />The film just showed a lot of errors in the way it was structured, the proceedings truly discouraged me to be involved and interested. Several elements proved to be critical mistakes. I was quite surprised as to how Avnet managed to convince this impressive cast to accept this project. Then, the screenplay plays its desperate hand by displaying some forensics groundwork and some tricky camera-work  which are obviously meant to add some \\"meat\\" to the film. Carla Gugino's character Karen seemed to be an obvious plot device to add some tension as well as eye candy; but her assault by the killer just felt too cheap. As a whodunit cop film, the movie falls apart.<br /><br />The mistakes with \\"Righteous Kill\\" began and ended with the fact that it showed its cards too soon, it misuses its good elements, and it gave this terrific cast some, but too little to work with. There is a very good film underneath, which could have easily been solved by re-shoots and re-editing but I suppose Avnet liked his product as it is. The film isn't that bad, it does have a good premise but it just does nothing with its iconic leads. One might say, predictability can be accepted and if the journey is rewarding--well, the one great thing we can divulge from this film is the fact that it does star Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino. Yep, their performances does command respect.<br /><br />Recommended with caution for Pacino and DeNiro fans, and a Rental for everybody else [3 Stars]<br /><br />Video/Audio: 2.35 ratio anamorphic widescreen. Beautiful transfer, natural colors and strong black levels. Minor enhancements here and there but overall, the Dvd yields a good picture. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is quite clear and powerful enough.<br />Extras: Interviews, production notes/making of/ trailersust felt too cheap. As a whodunit cop film, the movie falls apart.

B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jeff Beck is a fabulous guitarist, easily one of the 5 finest guitar players I've ever heard and seen play live. He is a true musician who literally plays every note with the depth and feel of his entire being. Other reviewers have compared him favorably to some of the major jazz guitarists currently on the scene, such as John McLaughlin and John Scofield. In my opinion, those guys aren't even close to being in the same category as Beck. They're highly educated technicians, while Beck is a thru and thru musician. It's not about how many scales, arpeggios, triads, modes and chords a guitarist knows, it's all about how he moves the listener emotionally. Jeff Beck MOVES this listener. Conversely, many reviewers have rated Beck as more accomplished than Jimi Hendrix. A guitarist as uniquely gifted, adventurous, creative and innovative as Jimi Hendrix comes along only once. Beck truly moves me but Jimi sends me into another galaxy. Sorry but, in my humble opinion, Jeff Beck is no Jimi Hendrix. If you read interviews with Jeff Beck, you'll see that he's the first one to agree with me.
B000HC2LI0|1.0|I ordered this box set Dec 13th. I was given a delivery window of Dec 19th to Jan. 7th. As of the 7th I still had not received the order.I emailed Sophies Movies twice and it took 2 days to get a response. They sent me a tracking number and when I checked with the post office they stated the order had been delivered on Dec 23rd. I was diligently checking the mail daily as I was expecting this order but it never arrived. Maybe had I not waited until Jan 7th I may have been able to track it better. Further contact with Sophies Movies has only resulted in emails referring me to the tracking number. Customer service both through Sophies Movies and Amazon have been lacking and disappointing. I will not be using either again.

B001LRJH0K|4.0|Appaloosa is a great, crowd-pleaser of a western that contains most of what makes modern-day westers so good in the first place.  Ed Harris directs, co-scripts, and stars as Virgil Cole, who along with his longtime partner Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) come to the town of Appaloosa to be new lawmen, and to take down a slippery, murderous rancher (Jeremy Irons).  Things get complicated by a shady widower (Renee Zellweger) who catches the eye and heart of Cole, and every other element combines to lead up to an inevitable showdown.  While it never reaches the level of greatness that James Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma did, Appaloosa doesn't try to either.  Harris' take on the western is a tried and true portrait that delivers the goods that viewers would hope to find with the film, and it delivers them quite good to boot.  Harris and Mortensen in particular are perfect in their respective roles, while Zellweger and Irons deliver solid turns as well.  With gorgeous cinematography (that looks even better on Blu-Ray) and supporting work from Lance Henriksen and Timothy Spall, Appaloosa is a treat of a western that every fan of the genre will find something to admire about it.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|I first saw this back in 1982. I could barely remember the story line. But after 10 minutes, the emotionally painful and sometimes grating scenes reminded me of this great movie. A great study of character acting. Fantastic performances by the entire cast. Not much more to add than has already been written by the numerous other reviews. Elizabeth Taylor was absolutely marvelous.
1932907009|5.0|A great screenwriting tool whether you're a novice or an experienced writer. There's nothing complicated about Blake's methods -- Save the Cat! offers a practical, straightforward way to craft your screen story, written by someone who has experienced the same pitfalls and frustrations endured by every screenwriter.    Once you master Blake's guidelines on structure, it frees you up to concentrate on character, dialogue, all the fun stuff. I refer to it during those dark moments in the middle of writing a script when I've completely lost my way. It focuses me back on the basics of storytelling, regardless of how complicated the plot.     I've also found it invaluable during the rewrite process. If my story beats aren't in the right place, it's an indication that something in the story isn't working as it should be. Get the structure right, everything else will follow.    Full of solid advice and always an entertaining read. Highly recommend it.
0896762629|5.0|Anyone interested in how people *really* dressed in Europe between 1540 and 1660 will greet this book with cries of joy. Short of making personal visits to museums all over the world you couldn't get a more detailed view of the garments on display here. Delicate lace, lavish embroidery, and meticulous stitching are all presented in a well-chosen mixture of drawings, paintings and photographs. Unlike the previous books in this series, most of the paintings and photographs are printed in full color, making them even more informative and attractive. The histories of the individual pieces of clothing are as fascinating as the way they were made; many of these items were preserved because they were associated with important historical figures and events.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Always entertaining. Even better now that we own them! Got tired of commercial breaks when catching it on TV. The set was a gift for my husband and they were opened, watched and watched again a few days later over the holidays. Perfect holiday fare. The 3 movies are great, fun and what can I say about  Matt Damon that hasn't been said?!  He is perfect as Jason Bourne. Every actor in these movies are in top form as well.
0385340990|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is the most delightful book I've read in several years.  You are drawn into the lives of the characters by the means of funny and sometimes poignant letters that race between Juliet and the residents of Guernsey. It's a \\"can't put it down\\" book.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This series is one I'll always keep in my collection. I tend to pass everything on to friends and family, etc. but not this. When I'm feeling a little down, I just put in Planet Earth to remind myself what amazing beauty we are surrounded by and how truly astonishing our planet is. I can't believe some of the shots these guys get! How, I have no idea. Soooo cool.

B000MRAAJM|3.0|All videos are fantastic, breathtaking. Picture quality, sharpness, clarity is second to none. The series offer an opportunity to see, appreciate and understand the nature of our Planet Earth.    But there are two problems with this monumental work. First, the authors push way too much animal sex. I'm always puzzled why pretty much all the creators of documentaries about wildlife think that it is extremely important for every viewer to observe how all the animals, birds and insects mate. Why not just let them do it alone? I and my family can live without it.    Second, we did not enjoy frequent, extremely graphic shots of carnivors chasing and killing, then tearing apart and eating their prey.     It could have been a wonderful learning material for children, an enjoyable video for families to watch together, but unfortunately it isn't.
B000PDZNSQ|5.0|I first acquired a vinyl copy of this album a couple of years after its release, in 1970, after stumbling across it at one of the many record shops I used to frequent. Always a great admirer of Abbey Road by The Beatles, it was immediately visually intriguing, for obvious reasons. Having long ago lost track of that initial copy, it wasn't until I bought the Booker T & The MGs \\"Time Is Tight\\" box, that I remembered just how brilliant this album-long Abbey Road tribute was.    It consists of instrumental covers of Abbey Road, more or less in its entirety, albeit not in corresponding sequential order. It is everything and more anyone familiar with the legendary Stax house band's sound might expect: soulful, organic, inspired and, above all else, so tight - it's obvious these guys have played together before.    McLemore Avenue - the address of Stax studios - is one of those albums you can put on when you feel like listening intently to masterful musicianship, alone in the dark, perfectly positioned between the speakers; or when you feel like moving to that wonderful MGs groove; or just as pleasant, yet almost always engaging, background music. If you're a Beatles fan, and have somehow managed to miss this album, you have an unexpected treat in store.    Frustratingly, copies of McLemore Avenue appear to be difficult to find. This Japanese reissue, is an expensive option, especially given that it is not one of those limited edition, vinyl replica paper sleeve items, as you might expect. It is one disc in a standard jewel case. The sound is everything you would expect, however, and I am pleased to now have a pristine CD of this much-loved album.
B001F12J48|1.0|My family loved the Polar Express movie and was excited to see a 3D version being released. Even though we owned the original film on DVD we thought picking up the 3D version would be worth it...bad decision, a total waste of $20. Horrible, horrible 3D quality...fuzzy, red, blurry, double vision...gave us all headaches. We ended up just turning it off. We even tried using different 3D glasses and tried it on different televisions, still very poor quality. Don't buy the 3D version of this film if you already own the original DVD.
B000099T3P|5.0|Ahh, Critters, we remember thee well...<br /><br />Interstellar hedgehogs with poisonous quills and a killer appetite. Vintage 80's schtick. Very apparent from the costuming and the hair! This series was always a bunch of fun on account of its irreverence and self-referential humor.<br /><br />Basically bounty hunters get tasked with hunting down the Crites (\\"critters,\\" in Earth parlance), after they escape from high-security incarceration and hijack a ship that crashes (lands?) on Earth.<br /><br />The Crites, of course, are hungry and have a rather un-sunny disposition. Much gore and dark humor ensue. Worth a watch for the 80's nostalgia and a few relatively funny moments. However, some parts are just painful (awkward) to watch...<br /><br />As far as the physical disc itself, it's attractive, but lacks any significant special features. No commentary, no trailers other than the other Critters movies, no other special features. A bit disappointing in that regards. But the picture and sound seemed good enough to me. Considering the source material.

B0000AQS0F|1.0|I absolutely cannot believe all the good reviews for this series.  We barely made it through the 2 hour \\"Serenity\\" and 1/2 of \\"The Train Job\\" when we just could not stand it any longer.  Shoddy acting, predictable writing, boring and cliche characters, laughable special effects,bizarre western/space theme... ugh.  This was horrible.  Seriously people if you want to watch great science fiction, Battlestar Galactica or old Farscape is the only way to go.

1420931571|4.0|I have never read a book quite like this.  It was written in 1922 supposedly, yet feels unbelievably modern.  It's funny and sardonic and heartbreaking and very very real.  The way Fitzgerald observes his world, in such ripely vivid and specific detail, with little overly portentious and self-aware \\"symbolism\\" makes it seem like you could reach out and touch it.  Fitzgerald's flair for capturing people, both in their best and worst selves, his uncanny self-knowledge, his ability to understand and beautifully elucidate the problems of his group, while caught so inexplicably and fatally in their grasp is incredible.  Anthony and Gloria are true originals, although I believe they are highly based on Scott and his wife Zelda.  One of the things I really liked about this book is that it lacks the polish and spareness of Gatsby although that is one of my favourite books too.  The characters are really allowed to breath in this novel and if the plot is rambling at times, it is nonetheless compulsively readable.<br />The amazing thing about this book is that Anthony and Gloria should, on the surface be completely unsympathetic characters.  They are rich,  trust fund kids who are excellent at partying and spending money and terrible at the practicalities of making money and unprepared for the practical business of being adults.  Yet their Fitzgerald never looks down his nose or laughs at them and even through what might seem like inexcusable behaviour I never lost my attachment for either character.<br />Some of these reviews I've read here condemn Fitzgerald for moralizing with this book, that the whole message of it is \\"to do something with your life.\\"  Yet I don't think that's it at all.  Basically in the book we have two characters who are deeply in love with each other and formed partly by their innate natures and partly by the way they were raised to be unsuited to the business of work and practical life.  Yes, the characters are at fault, but Fitzgerald subtly indicates that part of the fault is American society itself, with its ridiculous military traditions, elevation of banality to a high art (the inspid \\"Heart Talks\\" pamphlets) and the hypocracsy of the great \\"moral reformer\\" who would cut his only heir out of his will for drinking.  Gloria is an amazing character, a marvel of specificity and close observation.  I love her because she is quite unappolagetically herself.  A woman who as wretched as she may be at times is perfectly comfortable in her own skin and feels no need to bend to the \\"proper female image\\" of her time.  While she is selfish and cruel at times, there isn't a malicious thing about her.  If they are both snobs, well they freely admit it.  The only thing I dislike is the ending, which I find doesn't quite do the complex Anthony justice and is not really realistic in terms of the character's mental health. Fitzgerald reveals his own flawed soul on the page with such honesty.  Never before have I read of a relationship that felt so real to me, that is reflected on with such honesty and generosity of spirit.  Fitzgerald was truly a master of his art and I am only sorry he was underappreciated in his time.hat part of the fault is American society itself, with its ridiculous military traditions, elevation of banality to a high art (the inspid \\"Heart Talks\\" pamphlets) and the hypocracsy of the great \\"moral reformer\\" who would cut his only heir out of his will for drinking.

031606792X|3.0|This is a mom to mom review.  Spoiler Alert!  I read the entire series.  Breaking Dawn goes way beyond the others in terms of what I would consider adult content and sensuality.  There is a honeymoon scene that deals with naughty lingerie, body self-conciousness, biting headboards and pillows- you get the picture.  If your child wants to finish the series, just start on page 128.  Then you only have to deal with a rather frightening and bloody birth scene.  Bella is still quite hormonal all the way through even though she no longer has hormones. I think this series is better suited to high schoolers and up, but it is a raging hit with middle schoolers, so be prepared to have discussions with your daughter(s).
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Anyone can say whatever they want about Nickelback...right? They are simply the best kick a** rock band anywhere. They don't try to be anything they're not. They just rock. Yeah..there's not many violins, orchestas, etc...They are a rock band, and a damn good one at that. Quit looking for supposed new techniques and just enjoy what they are the \\"best\\" at. The lyrics are written just for most of you complain about. Although this is a \\"pro nick\\" review...I chuckle everytime I listen to Kroeger chuckle all the way to the Canadian bank. As far as that goes \\"Theory\\" is a close second. Keep kickin' it!! We all wanna be a Rockstar. Now that song really sucks, eh?
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm no stranger to exercise -- work out every day for at least 45 min, and usually more. My main forms of exercise are swimming, the usual cardio machines (treadmill, elliptical, stair stepper, rower, etc.) and weights. So I was expecting to cruise through this workout without much trouble.<br /><br />Wrong!! The 30-Day Shred gives you a very thorough workout -- I was quite sore the day after my first use of the routines. Got the heart rate up and sustained, good mix of cardio and strength, and all done with straightforward routines.<br /><br />The programs are well done -- a bit chatty, but once you learn the routines you can kill the sound. Fast paced, so you may want to just watch it once from start to finish to get an idea of what's in store before actually starting. Good instructions throughout, as well as tips to ensure you are maintaining proper form to maximize results and avoid injury.<br /><br />I'm not looking to lose weight, but I have no doubt that sticking with this, coupled with a heathy diet, will very much aid those looking to lose a bit. Granted, any exercise plus a good, balanced diet will do the trick -- there's no magic to achieve fitness -- but this DVD is an entertaining and engaging way to get moving!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I purchased this from amazon at a nice discount and will enjoy this amazing series for many years to come.  The version I have features David Attenborough.  It is one DVD set worth purchasing for the extra Blueray price.  Great picture and even the sound is better.  Very educational for children and adults alike.  560 minutes of bliss :)
0316017922|4.0|I almost gave this 3 stars, but gave it 4, mainly because it was a very interesting read. However, the thrust of the book, that one's circumstances are more influential on one's success than one's own hard work, wasn't that compelling to me. Certainly, how one is raised or the opportunities one has play a big part in leading to great success, but I think Gladwell too much minimized hard work as a factor. Alot of people have opportunities, but why is it that some take advantage of those opportunities and others don't? I think there is a matter of judgement in one's path to success, and that doesn't seem to be considered here.    The first half of the book gave a number of compelling examples about how one's circumstances contribute to one's great success. But by the end of the book, particularly when Gladwell is writing about his parents, the gist seems to be about hard work.     While very interesting examples of culture affecting behavior are given throughout, how did the Kentucky family feud chapters fit in with the rest of the book about success? Also, the second half of the book was all over the place though the KIPP school chapters were extremely interesting to read about.    Overall, well written, nice interesting narratives of cultural phenomena, but a bit short and not entirely convincing on the circumstances aspect.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|this is such a great show but it is better when you can enjoy it without the interuptions and when you want. Some of these episodes I watch again and again. I just love dvd. It's the only decent way to enjoy tv.
0312360266|1.0|This book is poorly written and filled with smut. If you are a conservative parent, you do not want your kids to read this.  The language and content is very inappropriate for the target age group.  How does crap like this get published?

0375714839|5.0|With all the discussion of Iran going on in the media, few sources allow a reader such an insightful and thought-provoking portrait as Marjane Satrapi's wonderful Persepolis. The Islamic revolution of 1979, when Satrapi was a young girl, is the beginning backdrop of her autobiographical tale, and it sets the stage for the years to come in the author's life. As she deals with issues of freedom, religion, growing up, and becoming yourself--while her homeland deals with similar travails--Satrapi paints a thoroughly engaging portrait. She describes her work in her graphic novels (this collection contains both Persepolis and Persepolis II) this way: \\". . . this old and great civilization has been discussed mostly in connection with fundamentalism, fanaticism, and terrorism. . . . I know that this image is far from the truth.\\" The stark black-and-white illustrations, so definite yet so emotive at the same time, powerfully bear this out.<br /><br />-- John Hogan
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a child.  Now I have it on DVD and never get tired of seeing it.  I have put it in with my students Christmas movies.  Wonderful movie!  In fact, I have bought both versions on this movie!
0810970686|5.0|If you are 9 to 12 years old, you will think this book is laugh-out-loud funny.  Our family has enjoyed the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series, and today the arrival of the third volume was greeted with high-pitched screaming when the package landed on our doorstep.  Four hours later the book had been devoured by two family members.    Jeff Kinney didn't write these books just for kids, so they are actually quite funny for everyone to read.  The comics remind me a bit of Matt Groening of Life In Hell and The Simpsons fame, but pitched firmly at a middle grade level.    For any of us who were once or future awkward, clueless middle schoolers (and really, isn't that all of us?), Greg Heffley is a convincing hero/anti-hero.  It's time to grow up but Greg hasn't figured that out yet, and he takes \\"wimpy\\" to new heights as he flunks out of soccer, watches one channel of TV all day because he's too lazy to even pick up the remote, and ends up locked out of a hotel room in his underwear during a camping trip gone awry.    When he finally saves the day, will it involve his Mom's fluffy bathrobe? Greg's mortal terror of children's poet Shel Silverstein? Or Greg's Wonder Woman Underoos?  Read it to find out!  (Bonus:  With Greg's lack of self-awareness, he hilariously illustrates the concept of an \\"unreliable narrator.\\")
B000A59PMO|5.0|Three years ago, when a local store was having a sale (buy one dvd, get one free), I chose this as my free DVD.  ... And, I never opened it since.<br /><br />Back in October, I was looking for something to watch, and I pulled this out of my shelf.  I told myself that if I didn't like it, I would sell it on ebay.<br /><br />...<br /><br />It's been three months, and I haven't sold it.  In fact, I rank it as one of my favourite shows.  I'm saddened that I never watched it on tv, then again, you almost need to watch it from the beginning.<br /><br />Veronica Mars ... how dangerous she is, how witty she is, but you can't help to *want* her life.  The eighteen year old with the brain of Sherlock Holmes.  It's amazing.  Sometimes she represents the teens who were the outcasts, other days, she represents those who you don't want to mess with.  But underneath it all, she is just like everyone else.<br /><br />I loved the mystery, I loved the music, I loved the characters (actors), and if anything - I loved the dialogue!  It was witty and it was well written.  There are a lot of pop-culture references written into the show.  And they work, because teens are constantly brought up on pop-culture.<br /><br />So, in the end, would I recommend this show?  Of course.  If you have Veronica Mars Season 1 sitting on your shelf, I'd crack it out.  You don't know what you're missing.
0679746323|5.0|An in-depth look at the life of Chairman Mao.  The information for the book was gathered over the course of 10 years and includes pictures, letters, interviews, and an assortment of other documentation.  Beautifully written yet terrible to read.  The sheer volume of crimes against humanity willfully perpetrated by Mao is staggering.  Particularly difficult to read are the detailed accounts of brutality, such as the horrifying death of President Liu Shaoqi.  Not even Mao's family was spared; his second wife was tortured and shot to death in front of their sons after Mao abandoned them, his third wife was driven insane (fourth wife being Madame Mao).  Forget what you think you know about how horrendous Mao was, he was much, much worse.    Hands down this is the best book I've read in the past year - and I'm a die hard fiction buff.  I just couldn't put it down.  Chang and Halliday cover everything from the formation of the CCP, The Long March, Mao's Super Power Project, Stalin, Nixon, and all the wars.  The allegiances, the greed, the brutality, the famines, the oppressions - this is a comprehensive look at China over the first 70 years of the 20th century.    I split the book between audio and reading.  Mostly b/c I didn't want to put it down and it is a brick.  Both formats were enjoyable.  I'd recommend this to everyone.  The only downer here is that when I raved about Mao to other people, 90% of the time they had no idea who he was.    *headdesk*  *headdesk*  *headdesk*
031606792X|4.0|Before my review, do yourself a favor and don't read ANY of these reviews, because it is so much more fun to not know any of the plot! Most reviews are actually blogs and reveal the entire plot. I have edited my review so there are no spoilers.    Like many others, I have become utterly obsessed and simply couldn't put down the first 3 books. I enjoyed the 4th book too, but I agree there were some problems with the plot. In breaking dawn, Meyer uses every plot twist she can think of no matter the absurdity.    The tease, the charm, and the wit and the characters are lost at times . But, it's still an exciting read that you simply can't put down, maybe not as good as the other three, but still worth reading it for sure. That is all I'm saying!    If you are sad that you've finished the series, I highly recommend Wuthering Heights, a classic that Bella frequently references and from which Meyer has derived some of her ideas and themes.
0743298039|5.0|Story of a young woman (the narrator) who is summoned by a wildly famous author of popular fiction, to take down & write the real story of her life. The older woman starts by telling the tale of twins Adeline & Emmaline and their growing up.<br /><br />This book surprises us with a paradigm shift similar to the effect of the Life of Pi. And like Pi, it was a little slow to me in the middle. When I look back, it wasn't at all, of course.<br /><br />This is a must read and, if I haven't already given things away, will have you wanting to immediately reread it. At the very least, you will think about it for days.
0312383320|5.0|OK... maybe I'm weird because I think monkeys are funny....  but when you add them to the plot of this book, I thought it was hysterical.  The favorite characters are back in this book, and Stephanie was funny as always.  Yes, it's not very \\"thought-provoking\\" or \\"deep\\", but I think if you want a book to sit down and escape with, have a few laughs and forget about real life for awhile, this book is for you!

B000VDDDVO|5.0|Having previously owned a VHS colorised version of this film, I decided to buy this so as to complete my collection.  I was EXTREMELY satisfied with my purchase, as the restoration is superb, with the colour being effectively an added bonus.  And, although some might say that films such as this should not be tampered with, the degree of expertise used in adding colour is such as to enhance rather than detract from the movie.  Add this to the fact that the package also includes a fully-restored monochrome DVD of the film and the package is an absolute steal !  Please note that I won't add any further details of the film itself to my review - if you haven't already seen this film, the honest truth is that you MUST !  And of course if you have seen it, then you MUST see it again !    A worthwhile addition to any collection and an absolute must-see-again at Christmas film, which should undoubtedly have resulted in an Oscar for James Stewart.
1401322425|2.0|I threw it in the garbage/trash/rubbish bin, literally! This purchase was a total waste of my money. I liked Jamie's cook show \\"Jamie at Home\\" and I have always enjoyed his hearty stews, roasts and soups. However, this book was merely a bunch of fancy paper, colorful pictures, and Jamie's philosophy (like his philosophy on chicken eggs.) Why would I want to know how he grows veggies in England while I live in Canada? I was hoping for some REAL day to day recipes! Nope, no such luck. If you are considering to purchase this cookbook, well, consider some more.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I also grew up with ABBA and liked them as a middleschooler (but didn't want to be uncool, so I didn't admit it). Then when Romy and Michelle's High School Reunion played some of the songs, it was fun to hear the old music. So, when this movie came out, I thought it would be fun to see it. OMG, how awful is this???? They butchered the songs beyond belief and the actors couldn't sing, nor act. Plus the entire story or whatever, was completely boring and exhausting to watch. Meryl Streep and her 'daughter' were extra nausea inducing. When I now hear ABBA I have these images in my head and it ruins the songs. Aww, horrible!!!
B001IRUCFM|5.0|This is really a fantastic album.  It is a little bizarre and slightly outside of the mainstream with it's '80s throwbacks and French electronic stylings, but the songs are wonderful and the whole album is good.  The other review is right, this isn't a two- or three-song album, it's an entire work that is really distinctive and very, very fun.  I heard it in a coffee shop this summer and asked the barista what it was, his eyes lit up and he was like \\"M83!\\" and I've been playing it basically ever since.  Easily worth $8.
0312383320|5.0|In the past, Between-the-Numbers Plums have been somewhat disappointing . . . with lots of Diesel (the now-you-see-him, now-you-don't spook who seems to be connected to The Men in Black), but little or no Morelli and Ranger. Well, Ms. Evanovich has solved that problem in Plum Spooky by putting in decent amounts of Morelli and Ranger to season the minor chemistry between Diesel and Stephanie. As a result, this is a full-fledged Plum . . . just as though it had its own number . . . you know, something like Frightening Fifteen.<br /><br />As usual, Diesel appears out of nowhere with no warning. Stephanie has three accused who have missed their court dates, and none of them seem to be particularly challenging. There's Gordo Bella who ran over his ex-wife's new husband twice and is otherwise law-abiding. Denny Guzzi shot himself in the foot while robbing a convenience story, so he probably isn't going to run very fast. The other is Martin Munch, a skinny, five-foot two-inch scientist who looks like a kid in a SpongeBob T-shirt.<br /><br />Now all that would seem pretty straightforward, but there's a complication. Susan Stitch has left her pet monkey, Carl, for Stephanie to baby sit while Susan is away on her honeymoon. You guessed it. Carl's part of the investigation team. Now, Carl's not your usual monkey. You'll have to read the book to understand what I mean, but it's all very funny.<br /><br />The story has one other complication. Have you ever read any of the Carl Hiaasen novels about cleaning up the creeps who are ruining the environment? Well, Carl Hiaasen could have been a coauthor for parts of this story as we read about the Pine Barrens in southern New Jersey and the mythical men and beasts of that area (including the Jersey Devil who flies noisily above the trees at night).<br /><br />Oh, and there's also a plot to control the world. Diesel has a cousin, Wulf Grimoire, who is partnered with Martin Munch to develop some pretty dangerous technology. Diesel claims that he needs Stephanie to join him so that Wulf will not be able to detect him.<br /><br />As you might expect, Stephanie is happy to help . . . but she's got to meet her other responsibilities, including those other skips, helping Morelli's brother, and advising women on how to handle their men.<br /><br />With so much at stake, you might not realize that there will be more fun than a barrel of monkeys (perhaps because there are lots of monkeys in the story). Lulu's love life takes an unexpected turn. And you'll meet one of the most dangerous characters ever . . . who has a most remarkable secret problem (that doesn't remain secret for long).<br /><br />This story is so off-the-wall you could almost imagine it ending with Stephanie waking up from a dream to be relieved that it's all over. But it's no dream, it's Plum Spooky.<br /><br />The only thing that's missing is some movement of Stephanie permanently toward one of the men in her life.<br /><br />Have a ball!n him so that Wulf will not be able to detect him.

0307269752|5.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Sweden 2005, US 2008) is the first of a trilogy set in Sweden. Financial journalist Mikael Blomkvist has just been convicted of libel and is at loose ends while waiting for his jail sentence. He is hired by Henrik Vanger, a retired industrialist, to investigate the disappearance of his great-niece Harriet who disappeared forty years ago. Blomkvist reluctantly agrees to take on the task, as well as the cover story of writing a Vanger family history, since Vanger promises new evidence in the libel case as partial payment. Blomkvist joins forces with Lisbeth Salander, a strange and tattooed researcher and hacker, and they begin to unearth unpleasant secrets in the Vanger family history while searching for new evidence in the Harriet disappearance. This large and intelligent thriller is a compelling read that addresses serious issues like the failure of the State social system and sexual violence through the development of complex and unforgettable characters. Part  thriller/mystery and part social commentary, this powerful novel is highly recommended.<br /><br />[...]

B001K98MFU|5.0|Really, the title of my review says it all. I already did a review on the DreamWorks DVD. Against my better judgment, I gave it a fairly high rating of four stars. This movie is so amazing, in the story department as well as graphics and music, that I hated to dock it too many stars because of DreamWorks flubs. But to be honest, I was one of the first writing nasty letters to DW and signing the on line petition to get an English dub. Some times I like watching anime in the original Japanese, sometimes I like to watch it in English. Whatever the case, not having an English dub was just plain laziness on DW's part, especially since the UK already had done it already.<br /><br />But enough with the whining and complaining, because Bandai has finally been able to do what Dream Works was too lazy to do. We finally have an English dub for GitS.<br /><br />As I said before, the story is great. It gets a little philosophical in some places, but that's what GitS has always done in general. The graphics are amazing, in DVD format but especially now that it's in high def Blu Ray. The music is more reminiscent of the first movie than it is S.A.C. That suits me since this is a continuation of the first movie.<br /><br />The highest praise I could give this movie is that I originally gave the DW version four stars even with DW's bumbling of a release. The movie is just that good that it overpowered my anger of not having an English dub. Now that Bandai has fixed that problem, this movie is a solid five stars. Thank goodness Bandai was able to pry this movie out of Dream Work's inept hands and do what should have been done years ago!
630460288X|5.0|This is one of those movies that motivated Last Action Hero to be made.  That being said, it's a great representation of the genre.  If you like the 90's action movies, this one should be a classic.  It's got a good idea, and a fun premise.  I'll admit, it probably isn't for everybody...but I really enjoyed it.  If it's not too expensive you should at least give it a chance.
006113399X|5.0|The Redbreast is a masterful weaving of parallel narrations. One thread is in WWII with the Norwegians fighting for Hitler on the eastern front. A second is in modern day Oslo, Norway, where recovering-alcoholic Detective Henry Hole has been reassigned to the Security Service. A third follows an assassin also in modern Oslo. While tracking neo-Nazis, Hole discovers a mystery with roots in the past and the threads begin to come together. Stubborn and determined, Hole manages to worm his way back into the crime division far enough to use their resources to pursue his investigation. Hole is an appealing protagonist who moves at his own pace as does this thought-provoking and highly recommended thriller.<br /><br />This is the third in the Henry Hole series (2000), the first in English translation (2006)<br /><br /> [...]
1416595546|5.0|What can you say about a book when everyone in your house -- and a few of your friends -- are all fighting over who gets it next? That's what's happened with Sashenka. Fascinating historical novel, well-written, and an incredible depiction of life in Russia during the revolutionary era and beyond.     Sashenka is a complex character, and the author has done a beautiful job creating a multi-layered character, as she navigates her way through these various historical and life upheavals.     The author offers fantastic description of Russia/Soviet Union, the geography, the scenery, the poverty, the exquisite palaces. Sumptuous imagery, esp. for Russian literature fans.     Beautiful writing...beautiful book!
0316286850|5.0|This book is an absolute must-have for makeup artists, and makeup enthusiasts alike. I found the photography to be absolutely beautiful, and the makeovers are exquisite and intriguing. Although I found the overview (the first 68 pages) to be a bit too basic, I still learned a few things and it could be very useful to a non-artist in need of makeup help. The rest of the book is fantastic, especially the Vamp and Bombshell looks. Although I may not do these in real life, they can inspire other ideas and I can borrow to create new looks. I wish it had a more in-depth section on face contouring with more tips and tricks. Kevyn also leaves out steps here and there (probably on purpose) but any makeup artist could figure it out easily. He doesn't go in depth about each full face application, just eyes, brows and lips. I bought this and Face Forward (for more advanced and creative looks than this one has) for about $20 with free shipping and it was definitely worth the money!
B001KVZ6DE|4.0|As soon as I noticed Jeffrey Wright was on board to play Muddy Waters, I knew regardless of the other components of ensemble cast this film would be worth seeing. He is a standout but underrated actor of the current era and whenever he is presented quality material to work with, a stellar performance is a given. Unlike the phone' em in roles of the James Bond series, in this instance as with Syriana or Boycott, his understated elegance shines through. Beyonce, as Etta James, ain't bad either. In fact, most of the cast is commendable. Eamonn Walker is another actor who excels off the radar screen, but his portrayal of the intensity of Howling Wolf here immediately took me back to his strong characterization of Kareem Said from the HBO series, OZ.  Mos Def (Chuck Berry) always seems to exceed my expectations which might indicate I need to re-assess my perceptions and it is refreshing to see Gabrielle Union in a role where more is asked of her than just being the prettiest woman on the planet.<br /><br />The story is loosely based on the history of Chess Records, a Chicago based label started by Phillip and Leonard Chess - the latter played by Adrien Brody and the former nowhere to be found in this rendition. Writer/Director Darnell Martin, who has done a great deal of TV work including the film \\"Their Eyes were watching God,\\" brushed upon most major aspects of the dynamics of the Chess enterprise, the Chess brothers' paternalistic and often exploitative treatment of signed artists and the influence of the label to the development of Rock and Roll but essentially the movie is a gloss-over job of another area of inequity currently relegated to the back pages of the annals of American musical history but deserving of more incisive treatment.<br /><br />Yet, notwithstanding my reservations about how closely the film mirrors fact, it is worth seeing only to foment further investigation of the subject area via other resources.
0316287059|5.0|This book is an absolute must-have for makeup artists! I found the photography to be absolutely beautiful, and the makeovers are exquisite and intriguing. This is more advanced than Making Faces, and aimed at makeup artist and makeup for photography and film. If you are looking for the basics and help with everyday looks, this is not for you, instead get Making Faces. The book is fantastic, especially the Explorer look! So creative and inspiring! There is more in depth face contouring explanations, where as Making Faces lacks that. There are also step by step photographs for some of the \\"normal people\\" makeovers. I bought this and Making Faces for about $20 with free shipping and it was definitely worth the money!
015206396X|3.0|I can't think of a person I know who would not enjoy the first half of this book.  The author has an engaging writing style and pulls us in to immediately connect with our protagonist, Katsa.  What lacks is any form of conclusion.  Granted, it is to be part of a series, but that does not make up for the disappointment the second half delivers.    We live in the 21st century, which many people (particularly women) feel is to be some sort of liberating time.  As a woman, I feel completely liberated.  I am not however, completely ignorant between the difference of  LOVE STORY and LUST STORY.  To romanticize the idea of non-commitment to a \\"14 & up\\" audience is ridiculous.  This is especially infuriating since it is quite evident the author is bent on convincing us that this is how strong women look at life, and how they should behave.  The characters show inconsistency with their moral/ethical outlook.  Inconsistencies in character make it very difficult to suspend-our-disbelief.  I found myself quite removed from Katsa about half way through.    The writing style and talent of the author is to be commended.  The message of this book, inconsistency of character and lack of conclusion prevents me from recommending it to anyone.
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This film is full of laughs, full of action, full of fantasy.  It's off-beat, surprising, intelligent, romantic, and charming.  Gaiman is a great fantasy writer - his characters are so complex and interesting, and the actors took those roles and made them real.<br /><br />Put a bit of magic in your life.
1595141979|5.0|I just finished this book last night.<br />All I can say is...Whoa!<br />I loved this book.  I thought book 2 was better then the first and this book was better than the first two!<br />This story was gripping and kept me up into the wee hours of the morning because I could NOT put it down, and I cannot wait for the next one.  It's just too far away.<br />I can't really say a whole lot, as everything I want to say would probably spoil the book.  But this book had me smiling, laughing, sad, tense and I just loved it.<br />You won't be disappointed with this book.  Just make sure you read the first two first.  You won't be disappointed!
B00006674X|4.0|Personally, I think this is one of Elvis' better movies. He plays a more serious role than in many of his other films and is well cast beside Mary Tyler Moore. The storyline is interesting and more intense than you might expect.    I removed a star from the rating because the film was marketed as lighter fare than it should have been. I don't think that the actors were allowed to create the depth of character that would have taken the film to the next level.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I'm old enough to remember this movie when it was first released.  Loved it then, love it now.  One of Disney's best.
B000002JPA|5.0|I'm supposed to hate Dream Theater, ahhh!!      Not only do I not hate Images and Words, but shockingly, I actually think many of the guitar riffs are quite solid, and the vocal melodies... well, there actually *are* vocal melodies on this particular Dream Theater album.    The entire album has a distinct moody feeling, sometimes spiritual, sometimes energetic, mostly melodic, and just very good overall.  I am truly in a state of shock right now.  The rest of the Dream Theater albums can't compare to this one.      I guess this is the very best example of an early career from a rock band being MUCH better because to be completely honest, the rest of Dream Theater's albums can't compete with this one.    The instrumental parts of the album are actually interesting most of the time.  They don't drag out for an annoyingly extended period of time, and the band members had a perfect idea in knowing what would work and what wouldn't.      So there you have it- I'm just... completely speechless!  I never would have guessed this band had it in them to create a near masterpiece, but they HAVE, and it was over 15 years ago when it happened.  I say, for all progressive rock fans and heavy metal fans, THIS is the ultimate Dream Theater album.  Just amazing.
B000002UWP|5.0|JOYRIDE is a great pop album and has truly stood the test of time nearly 18 years after its release in 1991. It is a testament to the songwriting ability of Per Gessle and Marie Fredriksson that that any of the songs on the album could have been released as a single. The duo released an album of very high quality with very few misses. I am still amazed how well this album sounds and what a tremendous vocalist Ms. Fredriksson is.    Some favourite tracks are:   THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME. Should have been the first single as it is the strongest track on the whole album. Certainly a power ballad but it is kept in check by the sad vocal and the wondrous spanish giutar accompaniement.    WATERCOLOURS IN THE RAIN.  My favourite song by Roxette. Just a beautiful tune and very emotional. My only gripe is that the song is over before it really gets going.    SOUL DEEP. An earlier song that was added to this album and boy what a powerhouse song this is. Should have been another single contender.     Other favouriets are SMALL TALK, KNOCKING ON EVERY DOOR, JOYRIDE, DO YOU GET EXCITED?    I was disappointed that they released what I consider weaker songs as singles. THE BIG L, FADING LIKE A FLOWER, CHURCH OF YOUR HEART are ok but nothing really special.  One of my least favourite tracks is SPENDING MY TIME. Sounds like ABBA ten years later and it is very hackneyed. Something that Celine Dion might sing.   But overall, I get a lot of enjoyment from the album and I still love it nearly two decades later.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is so good, that I bought it on amazon within the hour that I first saw it. I've never done that with any movie. In many ways, Equilibrium is better then its cgi-filled counterpart the matrix. Where the matrix takes you on a completly si-fi journey into the distant future, equilibrium takes you to a future that could happen. The main question the auddience is asked when seeing this movie is this: Would you give up all the highs of human emotion to supress the terrible lows of human emotion? I've asked that question to many of my friends and it makes them want to see this movie.     The cast of this film is nothing short of amazing. Christian Bale is amazing as the main protaginist John Preston. Sean Bean has a very small role in this film as Preston's partner but that doesn't diminish how important he is. He sets the tone for the film. The person I was most amazed at was Matt Harbour who plays Robbie Preston, John's son. His acting is very good for someone his age and I fully expect to hear his name in the future.     The plot of the film is what I love most. For those who have read \\"The Giver\\" this film is very similar. Its set in the no-so-distant future, after a third world war in which mankind is devestated. The survivors turn to a government called Libria, which is led by a myserious figure known only as \\"father\\". The leaders of Libra promise the people peace, and freedom in exchange for some god-given freedoms (sound familiar america?). This freedom is emotion which is taken away through regualar shots of a drug called prozium. A law enforcement group called the grammaton claric is formed to find and destroy anything that can make a person feel, called EC-10 by the government. Preston is the hightest ranking cleric and master of a form of combat known as \\"gun-kata\\". But after being forced to kill his partner and close friend (Bean) Preston begins to question if the utobia that surrounds him is really that.    The Gun-kata is one of the things that separates equilibrium from the matrix. It provids amazing fight scenes that require little to no CGI.    The soundtrack is truly inspiring. Each song fits its scene perfectly and turns the movie from being good to great. It can make you cry one second and make you want to go out kick someones butt the next.    In conclusion, this is a must-see film. Anyone over 17 will love this film end of story.
B00008H2LB|5.0|yo man, I am going to make this short and sweet..if you are a fan of rock, this is a must have, every song is good, heart pounding, head smashing stuff..one of their best... this album will get you hype....
0312370849|3.0|There is a quote on the back on my copy of \\"Sarah's Key\\" that says \\"It will make you cry - and remember.\\"  While this haunting book did not make me cry - I was so upset and worried about the characters by page 40 - I kept having to force myself to not put the book away.  This book, like many about World War II and the atrocities that were committed during that dark time, is a very hard read if one has a soul.  While these characters are not real - similar (and worse) things happened to millions of real people.  The reader cannot assuage panic or guilt or fear with \\"It's just a story - it's fiction.\\"  These horrors were real.<br /><br />Ultimately, I'm glad I read this book - to remember.  But the book is sad and such awful things happen that I can't say I would read it again.  I can only take from it the hope that our world has learned from the horrible lessons of that time.
0312370849|2.0|This book alternated between two stories, one of a little girl, and her families horrific story, the other, well the other was just pretty pointless.<br /><br />The story of the little girl and her family was very interesting, albeit heartbreaking.  It tells of what happened to thousands of Jewish families when they were rounded up by the French police, in France!... and given over to the Germans during WWII.<br /><br />This half of the book may have been interesting enough to get the book three stars, but alas, the writing was just so bad, as to be unintelligible at points.<br /><br />While I was fascinated/horrified to learn about what happened in France at this tragic time in history, it was a shame to have to suffer through this entire book to learn about it.

031606792X|5.0|I am 30 years old and I was interested in all the hype.  I have read and loved all 4 books but Breaking Dawn is by far the best!  This book puts everything and everyone together, with the just the right romance, suspense, maturity to keep anyone involved.  I have read through the book twice and have my favorite parts book marked.  This is an excellent buy.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|I, too, saw this clever piece on Oxygen this past week. It's entertaining, and I'd like to see it as a whole, rather than over two nights and broken up by seemingly infinite commercials.<br /><br />It doesn't pretend to be yet another remake of P&P, so one can have fun with it; like \\"Bride and Prejudice,\\" in a way.<br /><br />No collection of visual Austen artifacts is complete without it! (Or at least having it available at a nearby well-stocked library.)
B00007K02F|5.0|I am a true Jane Eyre fan, and this is also another version of Jane Eyre that I love! This movie is one of the most beautiful to me, with the breathtaking surrounding lands of Thornfield, and then Thornfield itself is so beautiful, and I so dearly loved the beautiful rooms of Thornfield, and Jane's, Aunt Reed's house, and I loved the costumes in the movie! And I dearly love movies with beautiful horses, and carriages! This movie was very well done!<br /><br /> I loved all the actors, and I loved William Hurt as Mr. Rochester, and I loved the young Jane Eyre, and the young girl who played Helen Burns with the beautiful red hair, they were outstanding!<br />The tall and graceful, young woman who played Jane Eyre had a shy and quiet, and guarded manner that I liked, it matched William Hurt's Edward Rochester, which was brooding, and bitter and guarded and moody!<br /><br />This is the timeless and beloved classic love story, about a unwanted and unloved little girl named Jane Eyre, who becomes a orphan, and she grows into a young woman who yearns to escape the strict confines of Lowood school to have a life of her own. So she advertises, and gets a job as a governess to a pretty little girl named Adele, at the grand estate of Thornfield. (this Adele is one of my favorite Jane Eyre movie Adele's ) Adele is Mr. Edward Rochester's ward.<br /> Edward is the master of Thornfield. Edward has traveled around the world trying to escape from Thornfield and so, he hardly ever visits or stays at Thornfield, because of the painful memories of his past ,but when Edward meets Jane, all that changes forever, because Jane and Edward fall inlove with each other, but a hidden and a very dangerous secret, threatens their happiness!<br /><br /> If you love classic love stories ,then this is for you, I so dearly love all these movie versions of Jane Eyre! I hope more movies of this story gets done, because this is a story that I never get tired of seeing no matter how many different ways it gets tolded, because this is a timeless classic!a timeless classic!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|Wow!  I bought this for my brother-in-law for Christmas...he is really hard to buy for cause he has everything...but he didn't have this and he LOVED it!  He is a music lover in his 50's and he so enjoyed seeing all the folks he had grown up with and how they looked back when. A great choice!
0312383320|5.0|This book is just what I needed.  Everything is so depressing right now with the world.  I love the monkey and that Diesel is back in action.  Good, full bodied \\"between the numbers\\" book.  A must read for all of the Stephanie Plum fans out there.  The price cant be beat!!
B00003CX8N|4.0|It took me fifteen or twenty minutes to get settled into this movie.  It slowly drew me in; it kept tugging me along.  With each letter written and savored I came to care more and more about the two main characters, and I wanted to know what would happen to them across the arc of their lives.    The film chronicles the correspondence between Helen Hanff (Anne Bancroft), a New York writer, and Frank Doel (Anthony Hopkins), an employee in a lovely, musty old bookshop in London. Helene is an outspoken, outgoing and spirited woman - quite a contrast to Frank, whom we first see as well-mannered, polite and impersonal - \\"at your service, madam\\" and so forth - the consummate Englishman with an Englishman's reserve. They don't change radically over the next twenty years, but I felt I was continually getting to know them and the shape of their lives better; this holds true particularly for Frank, once glimpses are shown of his family life, his moments of humor with his daughters, his quiet communion at the hospital bed of a dying friend and colleague. The movie drew me into the atmosphere and character of Frank and Helen's lives - sun on the old New York brownstones, the smell of books in that old shop. On both sides of the Atlantic, the post-war world changes, and yet one constant in these characters' lives is their letters. And the books, of course.    The movie made me thirsty for books, especially old books. Helen's enthusiasm and passion for them is infectious, and it's a rare movie that can convey a character's love of books without having the character come across as pretentious or pedantic. I enjoyed the gradual change in Helen and Frank's relationship, the way their friendship deepens. The movie dares to rely on simply that - words and friendship. There is no grand drama, no whirlwind romance; Frank is married and committed to his family, while Helen is busy with her writing and books. I could sense that they're kindred spirits, and under other circumstances might have fallen in romantic love and married, but whether that would ever have happened remains unknown. It's not even worth much speculation. What they share in this movie is so lovely that I came to enjoy it just as it was.
0316017922|2.0|Dissecting through the details of the overdone fluffy stories, I propose there is an underlying structure to what Galdwell calls success, which could be loosely defined as pursuing work you value while making enough money to easily support you, your family and interests. Abstracting a structural view, these appear to be his elements of success.   1. Reasonable genetics -  Reasonable intelligence. No serious life threatening genetic problems.  2. Lucky circumstances in life - Early in the year birth date may help in school and some organized sports. You happen to be in right places at the right times.  3. Opportunities to pursue - You have or are provided opportunities to pursue for meaningful and successful work  4. Influence of family, culture & community - Good upbringing; middle to upper class family with culture and community that supports success within the opportunities being pursued. A family that supports and backs getting a strong early education and a reasonable higher education that allows for pursuit of opportunities.   5. Hard work over time - Deliberate practice and hard work over a number of years. Including a good start in early grades of school and then into some profession
1932100660|5.0|A must read! After finishing the book I spent some time researching some of its claims and reading what the critics have to say. I have to conclude that Valid/Supported criticism of this book is lacking, I'd almost wish to see more, but all the critics I read are rambling with very little science to support their claims.

B000Q67876|4.0|Blu-ray begs the question: What would you rather watch, an average movie with mind-blowing visuals or a fantastic movie that doesn't stimulate your eyes as much as your heart?  In this case, we have one of the most well-written and perfectly-executed films in the history of American cinema formatted for a cutting-edge technology.  It looks better than it ever has (with maybe the exception of the original film but very few people saw it that way).  However, as a Blu-ray, the movie's transfer just doesn't stand out.  Some outdoor shots look fairly good, but a majority of the scenes will not amaze you.  It's not a bad transfer, but just an extremely minimal one.    I bought this Blu-ray on day one because of my love for this film, and I do not regret that purchase.  The packaging and extras are pretty good (although a few of the extras are a little redundant and repeat information), and the movie looks better than it ever has.  The problem is, Blu-rays shouldn't just look better than DVDs, they should look vastly superior.  So, those looking for the best in HD home video, keep looking.  Fans of the film, however, shouldn't have a problem making this purchase.
B001F290E4|2.0|Love Seal's voice so I took the plunge but was slightly disappointed.  The song selections were great but I was expecting him to do more with them.
0312383320|3.0|The book had a good story line but it did have its problems.  Everyone loves the storyline to have grandma doing crazy things, Ranger helping Stephanie and alwasy comin so close - but not. Morelli the cop and boyfriend.  We did lean about him more in this book.  The storyline with his brother and sister in law made this book more enjoyable.    What was wrong with this book.  1)Grandma always goes to funeral she should of gone to the one in the book and help Stephanie learn things. 2) The monkey was cute but allitle bit goes along way.  When he was lost and they were without him it was wonderfull. 3) Tank is suppose to be a tuff guy why give him 3 cats and a storybook house with him caring pictures of his cats in his wallet and not Lula..4) Lula is sick threw-out this book and we learn she is alegetric to cats and Tank leave here for the cats!! 5) Diesel pops in and give us a break he is a saint in bed with Stephanie and where is Morelli & Ranger  ok with this --NOT is the way it should of been and they should of cause problems for them.     Janet needs to remember people love the interplay with Stephanie, Ranger, Morelli, Lula, Grandma, her parents and of course all the bail jumpers. Lets get back to this and move forward.

B001M3LG84|5.0|One of Andre Rieu's best previous concert/shows was the one he did in front of The Schonbrun Castle in Vienna about 3 years ago. It is just amazing that Andre's Production Manager, Pierre Rieu, had the brillant imagination of actually building a real size replica of Schonbrunn Castle right inside the Telstra Dome stadium ,Melbourne for the venue of this concert/show in Nov 2008. It is most impressive to see the orchestra podium right on the doorsteps of the castle;the first floor ballroom of the castle right on top of the orchestra bay; two ice skating floors (one on each side of the podium); one water fountain on each side just beyond the ice skating floors. To complete the set up the somptuous chandeliers and wall appliques are as the original in Shonbrunn castle, Vienna.Four huge widescreens replace the castle windows. The rest of The Telstra Dome stadium is packed with 40 000 spectators.     After the entry of the Johann Strauss orchestra, led by Andre,and accompanied by the sound of THE SEVENTY SIX TROMBONES, the musicians and the choir build up the evening's lively and joyful atmosphere straightaway with BLAZE AWAY. By the end of this musical number a large part of the audience has already joined in the swaying mood.Andre's great talent of witty jokes and interactions with the audience start right away with the offering of the chair of the flutist Teun Ramakers from the podium to a latecomer in the audience!  FACHERPOLONAISE is interpreted with the Viennese Debutante taking to the floor of the top ballroom. After this relative short number Andre put his 1665 Stradivarius at its best in a usual fantastic interpretation of Johann Strauss' ROSES OF THE SOUTH with the Viennese Debutante group gliding on the skating floors and the Australian IJS dansers waltzing in the top floor ballroom. The choreography has improved to perfection over the past two years.The audience has started their swaying frenzy. The camera shots are outstandingly comprehensive both for the widescreens and for this DVD.    The pace quickens with The Platin Tenors' (Gary Bennett of Australia,Bela Mavrak of Hungary & Thomas Gruel of Germany) interpretation of CHIANTI SONG. Thereafter they pay a fitting tribute to late Luciano Pavarotti by interpreting Norsum Dorma- a song, among many others, that Pavarotti had used to open the world of classical music to millions.    The Imperial Ballet Group of Vienna State opera makes their entry in appropriate traditional dresses to dance with absolute perfection to an Hungarian number ELYEN A MAGYAR. After the very beautiful and joyful SPORTPALAST WALTZ there follows a fantastic, attention catching ,interpretation by Carmen Monarcha of OH MIO BABBINO CARO being conducted by Andre himself.I must add that I have seen this Brazilian soloist best in other interpretations eg.in Carmen.    The return of The Platin Tenors and the Soloists ( Mirusia Louwersa,Suzan Erens and Carmen Monarcha)in WHITE HORSE INN is probably one of the best entertaining interpretation of this opera song. The costumes are indeed most appropriate though ,I feel, the tenors should have had their pocket white hankies the same three point style as Andre's. I am pleasantly surprised to note that my favourite Suzan Erens looks fabulous after the 2-3 Kg weightloss.    The EMPERROR WALTZ is played with Sisi dancing with The Emperor Franz-Joseph and accompanied by the rest of the Vienna State Opera Ballet Group on the top floor,all in perfect choreography and appropriate costumes of that period of the 19th century- The camera shots here for this DVD are really outstanding.    After the next piece CONCERTO POUR UNE VOIX, Australian born Mirusia Lowersa gets a well deserved standing ovation with her interpretation of WISHING YOU WERE SOMEHOW HERE AGAIN from The phantom of the opera. Mirusia is introduced as the youngest opera singer to have won the world most prestigious Dame Joan Sutherland opera singers contest. She is obviously at her best sparkle playing,or rather, singing at home. Mirusia gets the audience's attention frozen during her very emotional interpretation of the Australian song BOTANY BAY before they broke up in a standing ovation at the end.Teun Ramakers,as usual, did a significant addition to the emotional element with his flute.OZIE..OZIE..OZIE....     The fabulous venue and its incredible lighting is again highlighted during the interpretation of the waltz of all waltzes THE BLUE DANUBE. The skaters  gliding on the ground floor , the waltzing couples swaying on the top floor, the waltzing couples in the audience and the dancing/waltzing fountains waters ,all add up to perhaps the most beautiful entertaining interpretation ever of this well known number.I believe that more wide angle (even bird's eyes) camera shots could create more impressive views.    Suzan Erens comes back as the young Empress Sisi in a golden carriage drawn by six white horses. What a spectacular entrance with TRUMPET VOLUNTARY! She gets in a technical mishap with her microphone but this is easily discarded in a most humourous and witty manner a la Andre. With a substituted hand held microphone she excels in I BELONG TO ME with the usual remarkable elegance.    BOLERO of Maurice Ravel, interpreted by  Marcel Falize,is perfectly accompanied by the dancing fountains water specially when 'Heaven appears to be opening up' towards the end.   At this point Andre and JSO is well poised to capture the hearts and minds of the whole audience with the lively but short interpretation of RADETZKY MARCH and brightly multicoloured balloons dropping over the audience,This is immediately followed by his medley of STRAUSS&CO (esprit joyeux etc.) that gets the  stadium carried away in the sway .    With ADVANCE AUSTRALIA FAIR and AUSTRALIAN MEDLEY he touches the heart of the Australian audience with a happy and joyful sing alongs. Andre really excels here as an interpreter of folk music and amazes his audience with his wide repertoire.    The elementof surprise is a real success with the marching in down the central aisle and on to the stage of The Australian Bagpipes of The Victoria Police Force and that, while playing SCOTLAND THE BRAVE. It is a perfect prelude to the interpretation of AMAZING GRACE with Teun Ramakers flute, Andre Rieu and Manou with a bagpipe producing a real amazingly beautiful version.    The interpretion of ADIEU,MEIN KLEINER GARDEOFFICER with the presence on the stage of the Platin Tenors, the Soloists and all the dancing groups convey that the show is coming to an end. But Andre and the whole group gets back thereafter in a very lively 'Samba' with a very South American interpretation of MARINA. Thereafter he slows down the tempo with a beautiful interpretation of WALTZING MATHILDA where he gets a large part of the audience to join in a sing along & sway. The last number  ALONG THE ROAD TO GUNDAJOU by the Australian bag pipers ends a beautiful evening of music where Andre successfully brings Vienna , its music,costumes,dancers,atmosphere etc. to Melbourne.    A must have DVD in its 16:9 widescreen format and an audio option between stereo or dolby digital 5.1.The version I have is presented in English but with Dutch subtitles.  A 'grand bravo'to Andre Rieu Studios to have made the DVD available within less than one month of the actual concert/show.
B000066744|5.0|When I first saw this film, I thought, \\"Wow, here's a very good film I'll bet few people have heard about.\\" I'm glad to see a number of people here at Amazon have seen this and share my sentiments.  Now, the next step is to see this beautiful film on Blu-Ray. Let's hope that happens.    The movie is definitely unique, about a man who spends his entire life on board an ocean liner and is a fantastic piano player. The best thing about this film, to me at least, was not the story- which I did enjoy - but the cinematography. Wow, what a great-looking film. Speaking of looks, Melanie Thierry is gorgeous. Too bad she has only a small part in this movie.    It was nice to see Tim Roth play something other than a detestable villain and Clarence Williams was fun as the arrogant \\"Jelly Roll Morton,\\" who comes aboard ship to challenge Roth to a piano duel, which has to be seen to be believed.     This was filmed by the same man who did the much more well-known Italian film, \\"Cinema Paradiso,\\" and if you appreciate how good-looking that film is, well, this is even better!
B001CTA1S4|5.0|\\"DOUBT\\"  Grade: A  Awesome! A film that sticks with you and continues to make you think... It is not the most unique of storylines but the performances are all amazing and the plot is handled perfectly, never giving away too much or too little! It doesnt take long at all for you to be drawn in. One of the most intense and interesting films this year. Easily goes to show that you dont need huge budgets and loads of action-packed special effects to make a truly interesting film. Every detail of Meryl Streep's acting is outstanding! It is a performance you don't want to turn your eyes away from, as she tears up the screen in every scene she is in... Also Seymour Hoffman is his usual \\"good\\" self... Amy Adams and Viola Davis deserve supporting nominations for their roles as well. A definite \\"Best Picture\\" contender...
B001LRJH0U|2.0|Story was a-typical western, power over honor, rich over poor (real world rules). Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen are great actors and do a great job in this movie. The story seemed to drag at times and Renee Zellweger really was a useless character (great actress but character not needed in this story), could have been a horse. Not up to Lonesome Dove, Silverado, or 3:10 to Yuma, but the actors make it worth it.
B001HN6972|5.0|WOW! I LOVED IT. Directed by Stephen Daldry (\\"The Hours\\"-- one of my favorite movies ever)...this is a powerful, almost perfect film! It possesses an intiguing story, informative tensions between our needs for black and white moralities versus realities of here and now, and outstanding acting, direction, and editing. David Kross is perfectly cast as the young, impressionable Michael. It will be interesting to see where he goes from here. (And, as a side note-- let me just say it now-- he is HOT!!! And yes, for those of you who have heard about the nudity/sex in the film-- he bares it all several times...) Kate Winslet deserves yet another Oscar nomination in one of her most perfect roles to date... (I understand she is in the running for a \\"best supporting actress\\" nom. and if that is what it takes to finally land her the award, give it to her! Nevertheless, this is definetly a lead role... Politics of the Oscars -- ughhh)... The film pulls at your heart and thoughts as you find yourself questioning your beliefs on what is right and wrong in a number of controversial issues. Like many of the award contenders this season, this isn't a film to raise your spirits, but it will make you think long and hard about what happens and stay with you in the end...  I had expected this to be a heavy WWII film-- something we have seen time and time again... However, I was very wrong. Although it does deal with the aftermath of war, it is a much deeper, more personal, storyline... This is an intimate human drama that I did not quite expect, having not known much about the film other than Kate Winslet was in it... Great movies transport you, and that is exactly what makes this as good as it is! It really does takes you away, and causes you to think and rethink... There are abundant life lessons contained in this film, and like Daldry's previous film \\"The Hours\\", I feel it deserves to be viewed multiple times to fully capture everything it has to offer. If by the end of this movie something deep inside of you hasn't been moved, then you had better check your pulse!

0375826726|5.0|Brisingr (a word from the elfin language) is the 3rd book in the Inheritance Series.  This book starts when humanoid elf, Eragon, is attempting to kill the Ra'zac in Helgrind by the city of Dras-Lona.  Helgrind is a slab of black rock that juts up into the sky, and you can only get to the top buy flying.  Meanwhile the Varden, enemies of the evil Galbatorix, have left the country of Sundra and are pushing their way into The Empire, a kingdom ruled by Galbatorix.  Also the dwarves of the Boar Mountains are voting for their new king, which takes weeks.  All this is making the Varden unstable, as they no longer have the support of the dwarves.  The Sundrens are easy to attack, and with the elves marching through cities towards the capital, they have lost the elves' support as well.  As the book goes on it gets even worse for Eragon and the Varden when the king, Gabaltorix, learns how to make solders that feel no pain, even during a fight.  If you want to learn if the Varden and Eragon will survive, who will become dwarf king, and if the peaceful Sundrens will remain peaceful, you have to get the book.    I recommend this book to readers who love dragons or have read Eragon or Eldest and liked them.

0060763280|4.0|Three years ago my wife and I read this book and although Harv has been accused of ripping off other writers, which may be true, Harv, in the process of writing his book has stumbled over some other less know truths about money and people's relationship with money.<br />Are there truly any new ideas. If you look at this book from the perspective of maybe where Harv literally came from, ( his childhood) you may see his discovery of money and his relationship with it.<br />I have been to six of his seminars and would say that the experience was 90% beneficial. There were times that it was just overboard, but we all need support in life and the lessons learned could help anyone.<br />My recommendation is to invest the money and read the book. If you don't like it, give it to someone who you think might benefit from it. If you like it then keep it for future reference.<br />Bradford P.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|I saw this at the movies with my son and it was a cartoon that even I enjoyed. It was funny and the plot keeps you interested. My only complaint is that some of the language might not be suitable. My son is four and I don't like him hearing characters call other characters names like \\"Idiot.\\" I know, it could be a lot worse, but in my opinion, four year olds should be sheltered from mean language.
159448385X|5.0|This is probably the best novel written in my lifetime, at least amongst those I've read.  The characters Hosseini creates are amazing, memorable, and authentic.  You won't want to put this book down, and you'll think about it long after you finish.
0545128285|5.0|Lovely book, easy read.  We read it in one sitting.  J. K. Rowling has become one of my favorite authors.  I purchased the book for my granddaughter who is also a \\"Harry Potter\\" fan, big time.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|This film was as much about the unique situation that developes in regards to the relationship between Ed Harris as the town marshal and Rene Zellweger as the woman with whom he falls in love. I enjoy westerns and never have trouble with standard westerns done well. This one however managed to introduce the aforementioned relationship situation, giving its unfolding an interesting twist. The film is told in a no-nonsense way, avoiding star moments which often slow the proceedings. This gives the movie something it shares with B movies of the past which, like good short stories, told their stories in a lean and direct manner, often making them better than their A production counterparts. \\"Appaloosa\\" is an excellent, tightly paced film which I highly recommend.

0385340540|2.0|I have read earlier Grisham many moons ago and so when I came across this book because I had time to read while headed to a dr's appointment I picked it up for a buck at the local library. Suffice it to say that this book seems to have been written in a short time and with little research into any of the major plot characters/groups. Not sure what JG's aim was here but if it was to describe Bologna and espresso he did it. Otherwise this book is good for passing the time while waiting in line at the local DMV or as I did, the dr's office.

I fell asleep on every page but kept reading hoping somewhere the book would redeem itself.  Total waste of money.  Picked it up while browsing in bookstore was amused that Oprah endorsed, usually this is enough to alert me that a book is useless as a read and only an author's cash cow.  If you read the next sentance, it will save you the price of the book and the agony of time spent reading it.  DON'T DWELL ON YOUR PAST, DON'T FRET ABOUT THE FUTURE, LIVE TODAY TO THE FULLEST.  There, thank me!
0307269752|4.0|This novel had it all: suspense, thrills, sex and mystery. But, it also had something else. It's a great beach or plane book. This wasn't your average run of the mill mystery thriller; it was a well written one and despite the plot being similar to a closed room murder, it did throw in some twists and turns. The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I felt more editing could have been done for a crisper and faster read. I can only assume that the novel ended as it did because there are more to come from this author with the same character(s) of which I will certainly read.

0375836675|5.0|This book was funny and had incredible dialogue.  I loved the first situation in the bank and was drawn in immediatley.  I really did laugh and cry while I read this book.  A bit more laughing than crying.  While I was initially disappointed in the ending, I am now okay with it.  It was a bit like Pulp Fiction knocked up Stranger than fiction and had a baby named I Am the Messenger.  I really enjoyed it and gave copies of it to friends with a sense of humor for Christmas.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|The Nikon SB-400 Speedlight, which I purchased for my Nikon D50 digital camera, has no bells and whisles like my old speedlight for my film camera, but you just slide it on and fire away.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This is another wonderful CD from Enya! Enya fans will love this! I really enjoyed this because it is seasonal but different from the usual Christmas fare. There is no Jingle Bells, Deck the Halls, etc here, just beautiful new seasonal music.
B000W4KT6E|5.0|You can almost see how much fun the actors are having making this film.  And their good time is contagious.  Even if you don't like musicals, you should give it a try.  It beautifully captures a time and place in America.  The music and dancing will have you up and out of your chair.  You'll be singing along in no time.  John Travolta and Christopher Walken are a hoot as Tracy's parents.  What a cute couple.  Now I have to order the soundtrack too.
1596434252|5.0|I purchased five copies for fiends' children. As a former design professor I am totally pleased with this book's paper engineering. My only concern is that youngsters might destroy the pages in their enthusiasm to see the letters cleverly revealed. It is definitely a book that needs to be supervised by adults when being explored.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|Hi from Italy,    Having to express an opinion concerning this release I have no doubt to give it 5 stars (notwithstanding sound quality is the worse ever listened on a Springsteen' CD, for example I have not been able to establish yet whether or not the Big Man plays his touching sax in Girls in their summer clothes).  There are wonderful songs and lyrics here, though not masterpieces, like You'll be comin' down; Gypsy Biker; Livin' in the future; Last to die; Long Walk Home and the whole average level is really high.  I've seen the E Street Band last summer in Milan, what can I say to describe what can only be experienced, it was decidedly the best show I've ever attended, it was also recorded so I hope that one of the terrific last Magic show will be released soon.    Ciao Raffaello
B000FVBLEI|5.0|I listened to this cd for about a month straight after I got it and never got tired of it! I've owned it over a year now and still love listening to it. If you're a fan of screaming metal that also has some good singing in it like Killswitch Engage or Bullet For My Valentine, than you will probably love this album! Buy it!
B000E41MS6|5.0|Billie Piper, who plays Rose, has brought a new dimension to the Doctor's associate.  She has a curiosity about what The Doctor has to offer and is very intelligent.  In many ways she's his equal.  Christopher Eccleston is a great choice for the ninth doctor.  He's sserious and somewhat dark.  The theme of Bad Wolf running throughout the entire season was a stroke of genius.  The special effects are so much better than they used to be.  On par with American special effects.  This is definitely a must buy for Doctor Who fans.
0780626966|5.0|The Nightmare on Elm Street series has been one of the most popular horror franchises in horror film history Startingly brilliantly with the unforgettable debut motion picture \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\". The first one is a wonderful and bloody psychological horror fantasy written, created and directed by Wes Craven better known for his infamous sleaze-feast from 1972 \\"Last House on The Left\\" and the 1977 gritty masterpiece \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\" came up with a very original concept for a horror movie based on bizarre actual incidents and childhood memories of a creepy old neighborhood man. The idea went to New Line Cinema as Robert Shaye (CEO of the studio) approved the film then after teh film was done it was unleashed in november of 1984 where it became the hit film that saved the low budget studio from brankruptacy and became critically acclaimed for it's unique and imaginative concept that no other horror filmmaker has done before. Like \\"Halloween\\", \\"Black Christmas\\", \\"Twich of the Death Nerve (a.k.a. Bay of Blood)\\", \\"Phantasm\\" \\"Suspiria\\", and \\"Friday The 13th\\" including \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" before NOES 1 turned into a revolutionary slasher horror epic that no one expected and introduced audiences to Freddy Krueger whom is brilliantly played by Robert Englund who later became a big time movie star thanks to this movie and even heroine Nancy Thompson played by Heather Langenkamp became a cult actress icon. The original movie marked the debut of Johnny Depp before he became a big TV and movie star, the special effects in the original movie still frighten and hold up well including some the surreal imagery for Freddy Krueger has ranked with the likes of Michael Myers, The Tallman, Jason Voorhees, and Leatherface but unlike those guys this fellow was formerly a pedophile/child murderer who murdered a dozen children in the town of Springwood Ohio then the angry parents hunted him down then torched him to death where years later he returned back as an evil entity who dons a brown fedora, a green-red sweater, has horribly burnted skin and has razor sharp knives on a glove for a weapon as he haunts children and teens in their dreams then literally kills them in them for the victims die for real too. Hell even Freddy Krueger and the series spawned merchandise, trick or treaters as Freddy, parodies, TV appearences with Freddy, a TV spin-off series and a big pheneomeon.<br /><br />After \\"NOES\\" became a crowdpleasing success with audiences and critics alike, fans of the genre demanded for a sequel so then their wish was their command. Then came \\"Nightmare on Elm Street 2: Freddy's Revenge\\" which debuted in november of 1985 is definitely the low point of the franchise as this is the worst movie of the series, despite it's good idea of being set five years after the original where a teen boy named Jesse (Mark Patton) moves into the house where Nancy used to live as now Freddy returns to possess the kid but gets so wasted by horrible acting and some illogical stuff like exploding lovebirds. This movie is infamous as the \\"Gay Elm Street\\" movie for it has so much homoerotic overtones that you don't know where to begin even with the S&M club scene though Jessie's girlfriend played by Kim Meyers is a hot redhead babe here nothing could save this disaster dispite the cool opening nightmare sequence. Now onward to part 3 known as \\"The Dream Warriors\\" is definitely the greatest sequel of the franchise yet! thanks to a screenplay by Wes Craven with co-writers Frank Darabont (\\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile\\") with director Chuck Russell (\\"The Blob\\" and \\"The Mask\\") they brought the series back on it's feet after the awful part 2 nearly crippled it as this one is set a year after that movie as an insomeniac beautiful blonde girl named Kirsten (Patrica Arquette) who is sent to a psychiatric ward after a nightmare by Freddy nearly made her commit suicide. Over there she meets up with other kids that had similar experiences with their dreams for Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp) returns as she wants to help the poor kids to become dream warriors to fight against the bastard son of a hundred maniacs. This installment is the most satisfying because of it's interesting material, twist in the end, great acting, dark sense of humor and imaginative special effects as it marks this installment as a winner all the way.<br /><br />\\"NOES 4: The Dream Master\\" became the third highest grossing movie of the franchise when it hit theaters in August of 1988. It's another great installment has Freddy resurrected a year after \\"Dream Warriors\\" as he kills off the last of the remaining Elm Street children, now a hot redheaded girl named Alice (Lisa Wilcox) noticing some of her friends being killed one by one as she gains their dream powers mysteriously as she must fight off Freddy. This installment is another wonderous sequel thanks to Finnish director Renny Harlin (\\"Exorcist The Beginning\\" and \\"Die Hard 2\\") for it has a wicked sense of humor, menace, good kills, great special effects and neat nightmares like the disturbing Pizza of souls and the girl becoming a bug sequence that is not for weak stomaches. Next \\"The Dream Child\\" which takes place a year after \\"Dream Master\\" for the beautiful Alice has been impregneated by her boyfriend and recently graduated high school thinks life will be great to have a child and future husband. But when her boyfriend dies in a horrible accident when he fell asleep, she starts to suspect that Freddy Krueger is back as indeed he is for now the cretin wants her unborn child to be the barrier for all the victims he kills including some of her buddies for now she must save her child with the help of Freddy's mother. A weak entry but still better then the wretched part 2 is not as brilliant as parts 1 and 3 nor as good as part 4, it still has some bizarre atmosphere with gothic elements and fun kills like a comic book geek getting what's coming to him but the film is basically a redux of \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" with Freddy as the star even though there is an interesting background on Freddy's mother and his birth.<br /><br />\\"Freddy's Dead The Final Chapter\\" was intended to be the last chapter of Freddy's cinematic adventures but it's not really. The story is set 10 years after \\"Dream Child\\" as every child and teen in Springwood has been eliminated no thanks to Krueger for an orphaned teen boy who is the last surviving teen from the town becomes a pawn in Freddy's trap to find more teenagers to make him stronger, he goes into a troubled teen clinic where a psychiatrist (Lisa Zane) finds out that Freddy had a child as she must find out who this child is to put an end to Freddy once and for all. This is a fun and somewhat silly installment that has cool special effects, an awesome 3-D climatic sequence in 10 minutes, dark humor with Freddy's usual witty lines and an interesting background on Freddy's history. And finally \\"New Nightmare\\" is the most unsual but most ingenius of the sequels besides part 3 as it deals when reel life meets reality for Heather Langenkamp plays as herself who is offered to play Nancy for one last time in a 10th anniversary reunion movie of the Elm Street series with Robert Englund (who plays both himself and Freddy Krueger) but Heather starts to notice weird things going on like bizarre killings of her husband and some filmmakers in hollywood, Freddy-esque prank calls, her son acting not very normal and a few Earthquakes as it seems a demon from the underworld disguising as Freddy Krueger wants to kill her and her child (Miko Huges) for she must play Nancy Thompson again to stop this cruel monster. It doesn't really set itself from the film continuity of parts 1 to 6 but rather it's own standalone installment with a great concept thanks to writer-director Wes Craven who uses the idea of a movie within a movie about a movie concept with some of the actors playing themselves.<br /><br />The films also star John Saxton (parts 1, 3, New Nightmare), Tuesday Knight (Part 4 and New Nightmare), Nick Corri (part 1 and New Nightmare), Lawrence Fishburne (part 3), Zsa Zsa Gabor (part 3), Dick Cavett (part 3), Johnny Depp (part 1 and Freddy's Dead), Linda Shaye (parts 1 and New Nightmare), Robert Shaye (New Nightmare, Freddy's Dead and part 4), Wes Craven (\\"New Nightmare\\"), Clu Cluger (part 2), Breckin Meyer (Freddy's Dead), Tom and Rosanne Arnold (Freddy's Dead), Alice Cooper (Freddy's Dead), and Yaphett Kotto (Freddy's Dead).

However Branson is very rich and interesting people not only because of his brave, persistency, smart and diplomacy but also because of luck and good circumstances.   This book is story about first challenges in life, first business, first love, first and probably last night in prison, first Virgin shop, first contract with talented musician (Mike Oldfield), first trip with baloon through Atlantic Ocean, second trip with baloon, legal claim against British Airways. This book also describes other many more personal, business and even political events, purchaces (Necker island) and contracts (for ex., Rolling stones)in his life and his business that gave him knowledges, life's lessons, family, new friends and ability to enjoy life.  So if you like challenges, adventures, business this book is for you.
0743497465|3.0|Dale Brown has never excelled in character development - or genuine characters for that matter.  Case in point:  Our heroine finds her one true love in a 12 hour non-stop adventure time frame. Now THAT'S realistic. The book is crammed with caricatures:  Bad GOP presidential candidate (sexist, racist, crooked, sleeps with his young, black campaign manager), the Dem president (ah shucks guy who won't go negative), the bitch aide, the noble scientist, the selfless security specialist, the diminutive but slippery spy, blah blah. blah.  You've seen/heard/read it all before.<br /><br />The plot is ludicrous - a presidential campaign is being decided by public feelings toward...NASA.  Not the economy, debt, war, taxes or some pressing social issue. PLOT SPOILER****  In a new height for absurdity, someone manages to drill under a huge block of ice and insert a rock that is made to look like a meteorite with alien fossils.  Yes, you read that correctly - hold the laughter.  The placid, nerdish scientists hold off (repeatedly) three Delta Force killers (automaton caricatures of course) who just can't seem to fire a straight bullet.  Think James Bond or Batman strolling amidst a hail of machine guns and never so much as get grazed.<br />the minute sliver of authenticity. \\"A\\" for action, \\"D\\" for plot, \\"F\\" for characterization.  Typical Dan Brown.  My grade - C-
B000WGWQG8|5.0|John Adams defended the British soldiers accused in the Boston Massacre .... this and many other little known facts of the American Revolution are protrayed in this excellent movie .... I watched all 7 episodes in one sitting!  The Golden Globes were just awarded to the actors portraying John Adams, Abigail Adams, and Benjamin Franklin as well as to John Adams as the Best Miniseries/TV Movie of 2008!
0142412147|5.0|Three amazing writers are brought together in this little anthology of winter romances.  My personal favorite of the three stories was probably Maureen Johnson's (I'm really beginning to love her stuff!), although the other two stories were also enjoyed.  Her narration style was very quirky and relatable, as were, as usual, her myriad of well developed characters.  She is given the difficult task of beginning the stories, dropping hints here and there that will later have to be picked up by both of the upcoming authors.  While I did love her story, the one thing that bothered me was even though it was all continued, I felt as though Jubilee and Stuart never really got an \\"ending\\", as we all know this snowy blockage would soon come to pass, and what then?<br />As I started reading John Green's story, I noticed the same names.  Waffle House.  Stuart.  Cheerleaders.  It was then that I actually realized that these geniuses managed to interconnect all their stories, fancy that!  It was a typical John Green story, two guys, one girl, driving in car.  The ending was cute, but the entire story felt lacking, as if something was missing.<br />The Patron Saint of Pigs was...quite hard to get through, actually.  The characters were not written in a realistic way, and it was really hard to identify with them.  They all spoke in likeohmyGod! speak, and there were too many random references that made little sense (at least, to me).  It was highly adorable seeing all the stories connect, though!<br />Overall, sweet book, but it might have been done better by one author instead of three.<br /><br />Rating: 4.5/5
B000AP04MO|5.0|What else is there to write about this movie?  Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney have great chemistry together, the script is intelligent, as the direction, and I for one have never found the movie hard to follow.      The way the different stages of the couple's marriage is contrasted throughout the film is particularly effective and poignant, since we clearly see how far their relationship has traveled through the decade.  No, Mark (Finney) is not always the most sensitive of people but he does come through when his wife needs him the most.  Nor is Joanna (Hepburn)a saint either; she's human like her husband.  And together they make the perfect pair to travel in their journey of life.  Sigh.  Can't get any better than this!    This DVD is restored to a much sharper image than the VHS tape, and of course the music is just haunting as ever.
B00007J5VN|5.0|I do not want to recreate the wheel regarding reviews, but SWEET CHARITY is a unique and entertaining movie summarized very well by the 5 & 4 star ratings. I would like to clarify some of the comments stated in the lesser reviews.       First, you have to remember this movie was made in the late 60's. You have to think about the context of the times; movie making was in it's infancy (or at leat toddler-hood), colorization was still new & you did not have computer enhancement & the cameras of today's technology.  Then add to it all that Fosse had to deal with.      Second, this movie is based on a Broadway show w/Gwen Verdon in the lead & written by her husband at the time, Bob Fosse. It is always difficult bringing stage to the screen. And w/a star like Gwen Verdon, some of the character traits of SWEET CHARITY were already established. The dancing scenes & choreography of Fosse are one reason alone to acquire this movie for your personal library. Extensive dance scenes, including group dancing numbers, such as \\"Rich Man's Frug\\" & \\"The Rhythm of Life\\" were novel ideas.  The choreography is so avante garde & fresh that THE GAP used parts of \\"Rich Man's Frug\\" in it's commerical's.  The musical number, \\"Hey Big Spender\\" shows the seeds of Fosse's later  hit \\"CABARET. Fosse was a genius and this movie was just the tip ice burg of his unique & creative vision. This movie also  provides the opportunity to see a young Ben Vereen before the fame of PIPPIN.  In addition, this movie allows one to see what an amazing dancer Shirley MacLaine was.       Third, you just gotta love Shirley MacLaine who's talent stretching from comedic dance musical such as SWEET CHARITY, to Oscar winning dramas such as THE TURNING POINT & TERMS OF ENDEARMENT. SWEET CHARITY is a quirky, silly story that warms you heart & Shirley's performance is memorable. Another quality movie showing a young MacLaine is Alfred Hitchock's WHAT TO DO ABOUT HARRY.      Forth, I didn't notice missing material, but there is additional footage of Sammy Davis Jr.'s performance of \\"The Rhythm of Life.\\"  I saw this move as a teenager, with pretty much the same observations as now. I purchased this DVD so I can watch some of my favorite musical numbers. If you are a Fosse & MacLaine fan buy this DVD. Not sure, then rent it.
0765342294|5.0|Never having read this book before, I was skeptical about how it'd hold up in the test of time here in 2009. Boy, it sure went above and beyond what I expected. The story is downright original and enthralling. Card definitely has a knack for characters - Ender was completely lovable and easy to relate to. If you're looking for a sci-fi book that's not too 'nerdy', and action packed, pick up this book. You can't regret it!
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|\\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" is nothing short of Genius and brilliant.<br />It's basically a love story but very interestingly and unconventionally told about three young children  two brothers Jamal and Salim and a girl Latika who meet under tragic circumstances when they are very young.The love story revolves around Jamal and Latika<br />The big story is that years later Jamal is on an Indian version of \\"I want to be a millionaire\\" and is accused of cheating so while being interrogated by police he  explains how he knows the answer to each question by recounting events that have taken place in his life answer by answer.<br />what comes next is a very emotional and violent depiction of  Jamal's life and how it intertwines with his brother Salim , Latika and many other intresting characters.<br />Slumdog Millionaire is not always easy to watch due to violence but it's  very rewarding.<br />It's not often you get a true to life depiction that's not glossed over and yet have it be one of the most feel good movies to date as well.Just as it swept the Golden Globes<br />I expect this movie to sweep the Academy Awards and well deserved it is.
B001JV5B12|5.0|I enjoyed Underworld and Evolution, but I hadn't gotten around to adding them to my library. The timely bundling/repackaging of these two films (to coincide with the Rise of the Lycans premier) seemed like the best value for investing in the DVDs.    The main selling point for me is that this double feature includes the unrated extended cut of the first film -- which wasn't immediately obvious on Amazon's product page at the time of this writing. I had to go to Circuit City and look on the back of the box to confirm. An added bonus if you buy this in a store is the online promotional code to see Lycans for free in the theater (a $10 value). It's also unclear if the Amazon version includes the movie ticket, as there's no mention of it.    It's worth noting the extended cut in this release does not contain the second bonus disc from the original extended cut release, which means you won't be getting the extra featurettes -- or the mini comic book. The original \\"Fangs vs. Fiction\\" documentary, outtakes, and commentary are still present, so it's not completely stripped. The Evolution disc is essentially unchanged.    In summary, if you already own the extended cut and sequel DVDs, this new Double Feature packaging doesn't give you anything you don't already have -- other than a new cover pic of dual-wielding hottie Kate (and the Lycans theater ticket code if you purchase at brick and mortar). However, first-time death dealers will find a lot of value for a bargain price. Take a bite!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|There is nothing negative I can say about this movie. It was great, and the fact that Blu-Ray is so clear....it's amazing. I highly reccomend getting this movie on blu-ray.
B001KMB6VE|5.0|Finding a kind word about this movie was so difficult, that I had to find out for myself! And was I HAPPY for it. There were so many bad reviews because Kassovitz's loss of final cut, had the studio edit and refinished the film. 1942's The Magnificent Ambersons was cut by 60 minutes by RKO. A crime; but there was enough great footage left for a feature that stands tall in cinema. Though it's not Orson Welles' work, this movie is also great even after a studio makeover. It has so much happening that you a can see where it would have been longer. It should have been longer, but as it is; it is a BLAST! I'm asking people what they think (many love it) because the critics (both surreal and armchair) are all too happy gang-banging this flick to show solidarity with the lamenting Director. That's nice, but an empty procedure; because what Kassovitz did do, should be enjoyed even in its present form. I almost passed it by and I loved it. BD A/V quality; sharp and loud!
B000HT3PPG|5.0|I especially loved the commentary by Maureen O Hara.  I learned so much about this classic movie.  It was great!
B001K98MFK|5.0|As crazy as this sounds I'm going to say that it is worth it to have owned the DreamWorks copy and now this one: I now know how important it is that a filmmaker find the right distributor for their movie. For one, the packaging of the Bandai edition is, in a word, stunning. On both the front and back the gyroid has a spot varnish that contrasts nicely with the aluminum box. There is no synopsis written on the actual box...just her free floating shell. The synopsis is carefully adhered with a separate removable square piece. They have even taken the time to rewrite the packaging synopsis so that it feels more like a continuation of the original movie. The packaging is its own art and is deserving of what is inside it: The Soundtrack and, of course, the Movie.    I bought the UK edition before this version was available, mostly because I wanted to watch \\"Innocence\\" in English. Yes, I enjoy foreign films, but Oshii has invested so much in the meticulous details of his animation that it seems criminal to miss the visuals in favor of reading the script. Unfortunately, how the voice actors were directed for the UK edition was a let down. They're voices were too sharp for a movie as subdued as this one. My ears had gotten so used to the soft and reserved tones that Oshii elicited from the original Japanese actors that I was distracted by the high pitch of the voices used in the UK edition. I could only bring myself to watch it once before resigning myself back to the original which meant having to read sub-titles and miss Oshii's amazing imagery.    And now comes this edition. The voice acting is tremendously better. Along with having the original voices from the first GITS, the delivery is much softer and warmer than the UK version and matches the mood of the film. Many of the quotes are paraphrased, perhaps to sync the voices with the animation. Or perhaps to make the delivery more feasible for the actors. Lines such as, \\"Birds never peck at green persimmons...they waituntil the fruit is ripe\\" probably sound more natural in Japanese than in English. Quotes such as these are reworded to give the intended meaning a bit more context. Though I was fond of Oshii's device of using quotes in the original, I didn't mind the changes in this edition.    After five years, I now feel as if I am finally *seeing* the sequel to the first Ghost in the Shell. Better now than never, I suppose. I just hope that when Sony begins distribution of \\"The Sky Crawlers\\" that they have have taken a few notes on what NOT to do from DreamWorks.

B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Few Hollywood film-makers have been nominated for Oscars more times than Billy Wilder. In his stellar career Wilder recieved a total of twenty one nominations. He walked home with the coveted statue six times. And he's one of a very select group to have pulled off a \\"hat trick\\", by winning Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenwriter Oscars, all for the same film. The year was 1960 and the motion picture was The Apartment. In fact The Apartment was nomiated for ten awards and won a total of five Oscars.     Much has been made of the film being dated today. Of course, the corporate workplace of 1960 seems antiquated when compared to today's automated, computerized technology. But the same holds true of hospitals, colleges & universities and even your modern supermarket. If anything, there's a quaint charm in revisiting corporate America circa 1960. But have office politics changed in almost fifty years? Just because typewriters have been replaced by desk-top computers, has human nature changed? Is the skirt chasing executive, who goes home to wife and kids in the suburbs, a different breed today than he was back then? You know the answer.     Billy Wilder's greatest asset as a film-maker was his keen understanding of human nature. Wilder, the director knew the characters up on the screen inside out...Why?...Because, as co-screenwriter, along with longtime collaborator I.A.L. Diamond, he not only put the words in their mouths, but also had an innate knowledge of what made people tick. Wilder could size up situations and knew instinctively how to play them with the utmost dramatic effect. Yet he never overstates and in almost all situations he never looses his masterful comic touch.    What makes this film so delightful for me is watching C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon) make the transformation from \\"nebbish\\" to \\"mensch\\". For those who don't know, a nebbish is one who has no backbone. He will readily compromise his principles, in order to please those in a position of authority. A mensch, on the other hand will always stand up for what he believes in. He has deep convictions and a moral compass to boot. A mensch will never alter his sense of right and wrong. So when C.C. Baxter hands over the key to the executive wash room to the philandering, J.D. Sheldrake (Fred McMurry), he makes that miraculous transformation from nebbish to mensch.    It's hard not to love this movie. It really has it all...The classic love triangle, corporate back-stabbing, near tragedy and loads and loads of Wilder's unique brand of subtle, understated humor. True, times have changed. There may not be anymore elevator operators, typists or junior executives....But a nebbish is still a nebbish and a mensch is a guy named Billy Wilder!

As soon as she and Lissa graduate she will be officially Lissa's guardian. All she has to do is get through the trials. She thinks it is going to be a piece of cake considering she took care of Lissa while they were away from the Academy. But something goes wrong and she is given Christian as her trial charge. Oh well, at least she will be with Lissa a lot since Lissa is always with Christian. And it is not like she will not be assigned to Lissa once they graduate.    The only thing standing between Rose and graduation is her trials. If Rose can pass trials she will become Lissa's guardian. The only problem is that once she is Lissa's guardian that means Dimitri will be too. There is no way the two of them can be together if they are protecting Lissa. Rose knows that Dimitri care for her the same way that she cares for him but neither of them are willing to risk Lissa's life. On top of this worry Rose has been seeing Mason's ghost. Is it guilt eating at her or is she really being haunted by her ex-non boyfriend? When tragedy strikes St. Vladimirs Rose must jump into action and show that she is capable of doing her job. But when faced with the ultimate decision, who will Rose choose, Lissa or Dimitri?    I love and hate this book. The story progressed wonderfully. The characters were great. The romance was perfect. The only thing I hated was the ending. It left me openly crying. With that said I actually love the ending. It was the perfect ending to the perfect story. I love how Rose's character matures quite a bit and she really wants to take responsibility for herself. The only thing I did not like was how she was unwilling to get help from other people when she really needed it. I love Dimitri. I think the way he handled his relationship with Rose was just beautiful! I absolutely cannot wait for thefourth Vampire academy story. I have to see what will happen.

0307454894|3.0|The story of Michael Berg and Hanna Schmit comes across as erotic and at the same time as being a violation of a young man's body. The fifteen year old boy, Michael Berg, meets Hanna as he gets sick. She helps him get back to health and after another meeting, Hanna seduces him like a female adult teacher seduces her young male students. With the rise of these kinds of relationships, this book should not be encouraged to be read in high school at all. There are other books out there on other subjects that can be replaced and I am an English teacher so I wouldn't suggest putting this book on the high or middle school reading list.     Hanna's actions are legally and morally wrong and that's the end. The author tries to rationalize Hanna's motives but there are other problems. Hanna's life is never clearly explained especially how she ended up as Nazi SS Guard during World War II at such a young age of 21 years old. Hanna's secret is so obvious that it's not shocking. But the story is simply about two people despite their age who truly alone in society. Michael's illness prevented him from really associating with his peers. Hanna comes across as work focused as a streetcar conductress who has the job of checking out tickets. She likes the uniform and the simple power of it all. The foreshadowing into her past comes later as Michael sees her in the courtroom facing her war crimes. This is why I can't give this book more than three stars. I find that Hanna is never fleshed out or explained in her life. Was Hanna abused herself, neglected, abandoned, rejected, etc.? I have read hundreds of true crime books searching for the answers as to what criminals like Hanna come from and evolve. The book is an easy read.    While I will get comments regarding my suggestion and insistence that this novel not be on a reading list for middle or high school students is because of the relationship between a 36 year old woman and 15 year old boy. The schools don't need to encourage this kind of relationship among teachers and students.

B000006045|4.0|\\"Mezzanine\\" is a wonderfully atmospheric collection of melodic \\"trip hop\\" songs that is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish and is guaranteed to elicit a mellow mood.  The different vocalists are all good and bring something different to the mix.  Despite the multiple elements, the songs all fit together very well.  Highly recommended.
B001FEA9QU|5.0|If you are, or have ever been, a Metallica fan, you must buy this Album NOW.  Simply fantastic.  In my view it mixes some of the classic crunch of albums like Master of Puppets with the melodies of And Justice for All, and then just  ROCKS.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The movie is great...one of the better movies I have seen in a long time.  However, be careful buying from Amazon because it was scratched and has a hard time in my Blu-Ray player.  It is a real pain to have to mail something back to return it.
B000VR824S|5.0|If you are a guitarist, then go buy this right now! If not, you should still own it. There are a few artists, who in my opinion do not belong on this DVD, and others who deserved to be given more playtime. Sony Landreth sets the tone with a blistering guitar piece. Clapton is in top form and John Mayer is fantastic. Jeff Beck soars above the whole thing as he does everywhere he plays and Derek Trucks takes \\"the school of Duane Allman\\" to a whole new level. An absolute must for rock music lovers!
B001NB6IN8|5.0|Amazon let me download this great CD for only a couple of dollars. This new Fallout Boy CD is Great. It sounds more like their old music.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I actually rented this movie before I purchased it and it went above and beyond what I thought it would be. There was plenty of action, cool effects and the story wasn't too bad. If you want some serious acting and drama there are many other movies that James McAvoy, Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman have starred in, check those out instead.<br /><br />Overall I had to give it 5 stars, simply because it was entertaining and I ended up having to buy it. Wasn't as predictable as most action movies are.

0525951113|4.0|There are other reviews related to the subject that you can get more details on the story line.  The subject is very current as it addresses several social issues: virtual worlds, gaming, and technology controlling our lives.  It is a typical good vs. evil story but with a weird twist, who is the good, who is the evil?<br /><br />For a first book this was excellent.  The author was much better that Dan Brown on accuracy of subject and ease of reading.  I work with computers every day and didn't ever think that a technical detail was wrong.  The other thing I did not feel was technology was not introduced for the sake of technology, but is was relevant to the story and the social message being told.<br /><br />Reserve some time to read this book, it is fast paced, very detailed and some complex subjects are covered.
B00006I53S|3.0|I have been using this lens for the past 3 years,  Considering the price is a great lens.  BUT IT Sucks dust, I thought i am the only one to get this but found out that almost everyone got infected with the dust.  This can make it a useless buy after a very short period.
0618918248|5.0|The best book I've read in a long time. Dawkins is an amazing writer! Before I read this book I thought, \\"Religion is 90% bad and maybe 10% it does help some people.\\" But now I realize religion (all religions) should be wiped off the face of the earth. We will all be better off. This book will be a classic. Probably the most important book of the century.

There was alot of geological accuracies that pleased me. And the story line I thought was compelling. This is the book that got me started reading anything I could find by Ken Follett.
B001GM28HO|5.0|I got this CD after I fell in love with Just Dance when hearing it on the radio.  Lady GaGa simply ROCKS.  Her sound is so fresh and new, her lyrics are witty, funny and way creative.  I keep bouncing around on my favorite song.  I think my top fav's are Poker Face; Beautiful, Dirty, Rich; The Fame; and Disco Heaven.    I do have to admit that I'm slightly reminded of Gwen Stefani in the tone of Lady GaGa's voice, but that's about where the similarities end.  She is truely one of a kind.      This is the first time in a LONG time I've listened to an album and loved every single track on it.  There isn't one track on this album that I think is bad.  I do have my favorites, of course, but I could happily listen to the entire album over and over and over....oh wait...I do.  :)    ~Sarah Beesley  [...]
B0015OKWL2|3.0|This movie was just average. Like most other people have said , the plot runs thin after awhile and the acting is nothing revolutionary. I'm surprised more people didn't bring up the waste of time w/ the brief sex scenes. I guess no one wants to see a 60 yr old man close to naked so they basically angle it so you just see the woman but the scenes (and the puzzling way it is initiated) just leave you scratching your head in bewilderment. If you are at the vid store and need something to kill a couple of hours with go ahead and rent it. i'd struggle to call this one a keeper. PS - tons of big stars in here, some I never even knew were part of the movie till I watched it.
B001NXBRJG|5.0|Nice idea to release the Blu-Ray box sets with all four movies, but really this is the movie we have all been waiting to be released as a solo.  I am not a big fan of the two sequels, but will definitely pre-order what has to be one of the best sci-fi movies ever created.  Please throw in \\"digital copy\\".
B001P5HI4A|5.0|FINALLY! The 2 DVD Director's Cut for the movie Yentl will be released... I've been waiting for a long time for this movie to be released. I fell head over heels for this movie the very first moment I saw it. I would recommend it to ANYONE (actually, I've already recommended it to friends). Unfortunately, it's not shown on television very often; but, it doesn't matter anymore. I'll soon have my own copy. It is definitely a classic. I can't wait to receive it.
B001I189MQ|5.0|One of the best made movies in quite some time.  If you haven't seen this movie, you must live under a rock.  This is a movie that should be in everyone's permaneant collection.
B001H5X7JS|1.0|I second the previous reviewers who say to buy the theatrical cut.  I accidentally purchased the director's cut from Blockbuster, and it was a huge mistake!  The director's cut is slow, bogged down with unnecessary scenes, and simply nowhere near as good as the theatrical cut. Don't make the same mistake I did!
031606792X|5.0|Hardcover book for the price of a paperback at a chain store.  Best prices on the internet.
0670019925|5.0|This is a beautiful book, one of Lodge's best.  I would rank it with such masterpieces as Nice Work and Paradise News.  It is laugh-out-loud funny and tears-down-the-cheeks sad.  It is a very personal book, since Lodge suffers from deafness and the material on the narrator's father in Deaf Sentence comes from Lodge's own experience.<br /><br />The book is a novel of manners, bittersweet in tone and drenched with wisdom.  It conveys a sense of the massive conflicts that can occur within small human spaces, the full comedy and tragedy of day-to-day existence.  The narrator is a retired linguist with much to tell us about the nature of language and human perception.  The setting is a place like Birmingham, which Lodge knows so well.  The action concerns the narrator's struggles with his deafness, with the technologies that ameliorate it, with a highly-sexed, dangerous graduate student, with his aging and, finally, dying father and with his wife, their children and respective families.<br /><br />Lodge understands the fundamental nature of the novel as form, how it is grounded in how-to books for the middle class, how it offers `news' and `novelty', how it utilizes the plot arcs of, simultaneously, Greek tragedy and situation comedy and how it reaches and touches us in a profoundly personal and direct way.  This is as perfect a contemporary example as one might wish.  It is highly, highly recommended.
0671449028|4.0|Nice book to end story time with and transition your little one with.  It worked like a charm.  Also recommend Good Night Moon.
0385338732|5.0|I have read all of Sophia Kinsella's books and this one was just as great as the others.  Fun and fast read.  I couldn't put it down.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I enjoyed each and every episode of this 12-part mini-series. There are some small missteps. Sometimes (very few) the special effects do not deliver, but on the whole the production values are fantastic. Hanks's introduction at the very beginning is not always the best written monologues I've heard. The series shows some of the cost of the NASA space program in terms of money, time, relationships and life, but on a whole it is a great homage to the hundreds of thousands of men and women who worked on the program. My favorite episode is Apollo 15 with the geology emphasis. It shows why sending men to the moon was far better than sending robots. The last episode, Apollo 17, may be the weakest, but Cernan had a great perspective on the whole program. Apollo 16, which Sally Fields directed, showed the cost of the personal lives of the families of the astronauts. The casting was good. The special effects for the most part were good. The access the producers had to NASA archives must have been excellent. How the episodes tied together is good. The special features look interesting.     In summary, the series reproduces the awe and wonder I had of the lunar missions when I was growing up. That, by itself, is an amazing thing.    I strongly recommend the movie. Who would have thought we haven't been back there yet? It just defies logic to me.
1416562605|5.0|I was somewhat skeptical when I decided to buy this book because some of the reports I had read said that it wasn't worthy of the Booker Prize, and that even Indian newspapers were saying that the book was overrated. It took about 5 pages into the book to see why. \\"The White Tiger\\" does not paint a very positive picture of India, but a rather negative image full of corruption, violence, and murder.  Once I finally started reading I was drawn in and all of the preconceptions I had vanished. This book is exactly what I look for in a Booker Prize winner: fresh, different, and completely riveting. Aravind Adiga did a great job for a first time novelist, and I will be anxiously awaiting his future work. I am proud to have \\"The White Tiger\\" on my bookshelf and see it as an instant classic to be enjoyed for many years to come.
0385339585|5.0|I've been a longtime fan of John Grisham's books. Some of his other books that don't really deal with legal issues I don't care much for, but luckily The Testament doesn't fall within that category.     The book is really about a old rich man named Troy Phelan who is worth over 11 billion dollars. He's had 3 different wives and 6 different children. All, unfortunately, aren't the most trustworthy people and would blow through money like crazy. While Troy never had the best relationship with his children, he did have a dilemma with what to do when he died. He made several wills throughout his life, but, finally decided on a way to do it that would put the fortune he'd earned in hands who would be wiser with the money than his other children. That person? An illegitimate daughter named Rachel Lane, who is a missionary in the middle of the Brazilian jungle. As such, a partner in the law firm who is in charge of handling Troy's estate is put to the task of finding Rachel.     In my opinion, the book, right from the beginning, is a page turner. Very hard to put down. It's just a quick read of over 450 pages that has the reader hooked and wondering how everything will pan out.     When I was nearing the end I couldn't help but wonder how John Grisham planned to end the book. In some ways I wasn't too happy with the ending, but I really can't complain. It took a direction that I hadn't anticipated while I read the book.     Overall, very happy! Another good, quality novel from John Grisham.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read the negative reviews about this dvd which is the reason that I have decided to put a review of my own. So here it is.. I bought this dvd looking for a workout that would be effective and easy to follow. To me this is the easiest one I have found so far. I will say this if you are like me (overweight and on the verge of becoming a couch potato) it will take you a few times to feel completely comfortable doing this video. No workout video is easy esp. if you are not use to doing aerobic exercise, but if you stick to it after a week you will be able to follow it without having to watch what is next. I recomend sitting down and watching what they do so that you can listen to what she has to say about how to keep from seriously hurting yourself.    Now for my experience... As I said before I am overweight and on the verge of being a couch potato. So naturally any type of aerobic activity is going to be some type of a challenge. I have bought other dvd's in the past that were too complicated and there was no way I felt like I would ever get past the point of tripping over my feet. Not true with this video! Within the first week of doing this video I was so sore from using muscles that aren't use daily so naturally it hurt to walk, bend and in general just move. In fact the only time I didn't hurt was when I would barely get up the next morning to exercise. For anyone who has ever gone from no exercise to something high impact such as aerobics knows what I am talking about. After 3 or 4 days of soreness I noticed that the pain had gradually disappeared and I could actually tell a difference in my clothing. I can't tell you how much weight I lost because I did not weigh before I started, but physically I could tell a difference in my body and so could others around me. I really like Jillian's 3-2-1 system and by the time you think that you can no longer do the repetative exercise you move on to something else. To break it down its 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength and 1 minute of abs. and then you repeat the cycle again. Each 3-2-1 cycle consist of different exercises so you are not repeating the same 6 movements over and over.    Now to date I am still on a beginners level. I still can't do regular push ups and some moves are still a challenge for me (remember I am overweight so physically it will just take time) so I haven't moved on to the second and third level of this dvd. If you are trying to find a dvd that you can easily follow this is the one that I would definatly recommend so far. My only other advice would be get a good sports bra.
0385340990|3.0|Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrow write about romance and wartime inhumanity.  They present Juliet Ashton, a published London columnist, and her relationship with the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, an intriguing title for the story.  You must read to find out about it.  The story takes place in 1946 after World War Two.  The major plot involves Juliet's transformation after her correspondence and personal relationships with members of this charming literary club.<br /><br />The entire book is an epistolary.  The reader knows Juliet by reading letters to and from Sidney Stark, her beloved publisher, and letters to and from Sophie, Sidney's sister and Juliet's best friend.  The reader gets involved with Mark Reynolds, a wealthy American, who pursues Juliet romantically by sending flowers, and writing notes and letters to her.  The reader meets the members of the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by reading mail between Juliet and its members, a collection of aristocrats, herbal healers and pig farmers.  Each writer of letters is specific.  Amelia, Dawsey, Eben and Isola express themselves as they relate anecdotal accounts of life in Guernsey during the German occupation.  It is clear to the reader that, even though tagged as fiction, these stories came from real life.  They are touching, chilling, and heroic, putting emotion and hearts to wartime history.  The authors were careful to give each voice authenticity.<br /><br />One portrait drawn from the letters is the story of Elizabeth McKenna, taken by the Germans to prison camp and still missing.  Her young daughter Kit is loved and cared for by various members of the literary society who hope Elizabeth will be found.<br /><br />The authors withhold information from the letters to peak interest. They include multiple subplots.  Who will be Juliet's longtime romantic partner? Can she resist Mark Reynolds?  What about Sidney?  Or could it be Dawsey?  Will Juliet leave London for the lure of Guernsey?  Is Elizabeth, the heroine of Nazi occupied Guernsey sent to prison during the war, still alive?  And what will become of Kit?<br /><br />Juliet's writer's voice is literary, making allusions to English writers, and glib, throwing in the unedited thoughts and observations of a young single woman.  The people of Guernsey for the most part are soulful, simple, direct human beings.  But often their subject matter is dark: the cruelty of war.  The juxtaposition of these opposites keeps the book from being mired down or too slick.  In the end The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is romance with a real life serious edge.zabeth, the heroine of Nazi occupied Guernsey sent to prison during the war, still alive?

1433502410|5.0|After reading and using this study Bible for some serious study, since its release, I have found this Study Bible to be of great value, an excellent translation and incredable package of study helps and articles that help shed light not only on Scripture but also on our Christian Faith.    The Study Notes in this Bible are some of the best I have ever seen.  Some of the most valuable notes to me are the summaries given at the start of either a chapter or passage.  They help me to get the overall flow of the passage or explains what is going on.  A wonderful idea and a real asset.    The Text Notes (that clarify a word(s) or alternate translations) are also very helpful.  Giving one more piece of information that one usually has to turn to a Bible commentary or a language (Hebrew/Greek) reference book to discover.    For me one the most OUTSTANDING FEATURES is how they have purposely translated important words/terms consistantly throughout both testaments- this facet alone  makes this translaion not only unigue, but a real blessing.  This means you will be able to see clearly how God has knit together the whole Bible with important words/concepts from Genesis clear through to Revelation.  A FANTASTIC and valuable feature.    Lastly, the introductions to different parts of the Bible, and all the other articles included, are very good- at least for those who will take the time to read them.  For example; the \\"Overview of the Bible: A Survey of the History of Salvation\\" is only 3 1/2 pages but it covers concepts like \\"God's Plan for History\\", \\"Christ in the OT\\", \\"Christ as the Last Adam\\", \\"Christ the Mediator\\" along with a few more.    For me the only draw back is that it isn't the New American Standard Bible, update edtion.  But this is only personal preference and does nothing to detract from the Excellence of this Study Bible.     I am just an ordinary believer w/ no special schooling or degrees.  But I do take the Study of the Bible seriously and try to learn as much as I can from Scripture about the Christian Faith.  This study Bible is a wonderful addition to my own small library.
0670020745|4.0|A very interesting read.  I think it would be a very valuable book for anyone who has a loved one that has suffered a stroke.  She includes a list of things that the patient needs and things for you to do.  It would really give you confidence that you are doing the best that you can for your loved one.  Fascinating learnings about how your brain works from the perspective of someone who is a brain specialist and then has a devastating stroke at age 37.  It takes her 8 years to recover and she does completely!
0670020745|3.0|I am a cerebellar stroke survivor, who like Jill, had a stroke because of an AVM...I was VERY dissapointed that she only talked about two parts of the brain - left and right, when there are FOUR areas that affect our neuro funttioning - the BRAIN STEM and the CEREBELLUM are completely ignored.    Her book has many good tips and indeed, I am nothing but admiration for her 8 years of oomph in recovery, and her impressive ability to present to TED...it is an easy to read book, but I was sorry her detailed explanations of the brain did not cover the entire story.    Other people have strokes in parts of the brain not discussed here...Truly, every stroke is different in what is damanged and what can be recovered...for a Harvard Brain scientist, I had hoped for more insight about the ENTIRE working of the brain.  I guess that is a picky critcism.  It's well worth reading, and Jill has spunk AND spirit...bravo for an inspirational recovery, and for the patience/guidance of her mother/incredible caregiver....caregivers make all the difference in our recovery as stroke survivors...
0385495323|5.0|Hello there guys,  I really recommend this book as it is really entertaining. You get to know many interesting personalities from the crypto world and it's full of curiosities and stories about how cryptography changed the course of history and how it evolved over the centuries till today. If you are looking for a technical book on cryptographic algorithms, this is not that kind of book. It's meant to be read by everyone, therefore the technical part is kept easy and doesn't do any in-depth coverage.  Good luck and enjoy it,  Leandro
0375703764|5.0|\\"The point of recounting these observations is simply to show how understandable it was that for Navidson the impendetrable sweep of that place soon acquired greater meaning simply because, to quote the Criteria directly, \\"it was full of unheimliche vorklänger* and thus represented a means to his own personal propitatiation.\\"    * \\"Ghostly anticipation\\"    It has been a few days and I am still recovering from this novel. Really though, this book is more than just a novel-it's a mega-compilation of mini-mega works all tied in together through this film, called the Navidson Report, which didn't exist, but by the end of the book it might as well should have existed because of how believable it-and all the devised literature surrounding it-really is.    This book, House of Leaves, a giant enigma that has an entire web-board dedicated to understanding it, solving its riddles, is highly literary. It takes from literary criticism, psycho-analytic theory, engineering, physics, and sound science, as well as philosophy and family relations-all subjects that intertwine with one another. At times the book feels like it's a post-college-graduation masturbatory circle, which may be true in that it's merely commenting on college writing and academia in general (just look at all the authors and publications that Danielewski concocts-pretty ingenious).    Though it's hard to tell what the book is about without giving too much away or going too far into it (this book sucks you in and spits you out, makes you crave for more then makes you wish you hadn't taken that last bite), the book is about a film that's about a family that moves into a house that has different dimensions on the outside than on the outside, and has a strange hallways that leads off into nowhere. Whether it's actually nowhere is part of the debate, which is one of many debates throughout the text.    There are two other main plotlines in this book that deal with the writer of the book, Zampano, and the guy who finds the book in a chest after Zampano dies, ends up editing the book, and throws all sorts of creepy, disturbing, and graphic, youthful stories into the mix. Included, for example, are 60 pages worth of letters that this editor, Johnny Truant, received from his mother who was in an insane asylum (apparently these were published separately at one point in the form of the Whaestone Letters).    The book really is massive at around 700 pages, but there are typographical avant garde-isms throughout that make for a quick read. For example, some pages have only a sentence or a sentence fragment on them. Others have text in the corner of the page, but it's upside down. The book ends up becoming a part of you-you carry it around, read it when you can, and are okay with it being a strange tome that demands more than your average book. While it's easy to say it flies right by, it doesn't-there's an emotional weight that is unsettling. Whether it's through the family's problems throughout the film's plot, or the mere disturbing concept of this writer, Zampano, living blind in a windowless apartment, or really any of the depressing sides of Truant's own life-there is something that will make your stomach turn, and apparently this is for the better. But days later when the book's opening message (in Truant's foreword, claiming you will not be able to stop thinking about this book) rings true, the masterwork of literature becomes a worrisome psychological probe that can easily become stressful.    But that's what makes a book successful on the emotional level, and with its intellectual grit, fascinating main plot, engaging late 20th-century prose from Truant, and innovations, it's one that will, as a cult item or bestseller, the book is a success that many contemporary works of art rarely even aspire to.

B0014XCMVM|5.0|In terms of growth, vocals, and overall depth of sound and craft, I think this is Alanis's best ever. Every track rings true: Underneath and Not As We are classics. Her most consistent and consistently compelling work. I'm stunned this was not a bigger hit than it was, but then again, look at what has come to pass for mainstream \\"pop music\\" in the relatively short time since this woman's commercial peak.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|The CD is great.  I have never once had a problem ordering from Amazon and alway get the merchandise when expected.  I have had a problem every time ordering from Barnes and Noble and will never order from them again.  Once again amazon has met every expectation above and beyond.
0545128285|3.0|I feel somewhat fooled.  Beedle's pages are 5 inches wide, but a full line is only 3(and often 2 1/2) inches, and a full page has only 15 lines(and many pages contain little or no writing). Add to this a larger than normal font, pictures and any excuse for extra line spacing. This reminds me of food companies sneakily giving less food but keeping the size of their bags and boxes the same.  If Beedle were typed normally, it would be only 20-something pages long.  I was done with it in 45 minutes, and I even put it down a few times.  I enjoyed it, but I thought, \\"Too much space!  What a waste of trees!\\"
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|This is road rage writ large and mythologized. The Joker and other villains punch, stab, and kill on the flimsiest of provocations - or with no provocation at all. If you're like me and not really a fan of such hyper-violence, this might not be the movie for you, in spite of the good reviews it has received.     I also didn't find Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker quite as arresting as many others have. He licks his lips and sinuously justifies his misanthropy with a startling version of the now rather conventional excuse of child abuse. This attempt to humanize a cartoon figure is not altogether successful. It might have been better to let cartoon violence remain wholly inhuman, inexplicable, Jack Nicholson-hammy.    Then there isn't much continuity or plot here. All kinds of themes and characters are introduced, only to evaporate. Gangster syndicates, Asian cartels, and minor evil-doers of every stripe come on stage to threaten a while - then exit to the wings. These villains fight and are fought fantastically. I know this is all meant as ultra-fiction, but I still prefer some logical process behind the action. I would like to know how The Joker could plant so many explosives and blow up so many structures in such short order.    The acting turns provided by movie veterans such as Michael Caine do provide an adult element to this special effects extravaganza. And the film is indeed visually striking, with Chicago making a gleaming obsidian Gotham. But in the end, this is still a cartoon and the characters are more action figures than actors. If that's your bag, this is the movie for you. But in that case, you might want to pass up this one-disc edition and instead get the two-disc special edition with all its bonus features.
0743496736|3.0|I want to apologize upfront for my snide tone in the following review.  I like being a smarty-pants.  Anyway...    Nineteen Minutes was clearly inspired by Columbine and other recent school shootings.  It's a story about a bullied boy who goes ballistic and shoots up his school.  It's about how his parents feel that they might be to blame.  It's about how the town agrees with them. It's about the girl who was friends with him as a kid who is now more interested in hanging around with the cool kids and her cool boyfriend.  Her boyfriend is abusive and treats her like a sex toy.  It's about the girl's mother's life as a judge.  It's about how the killer's mother is a midwife.  It's about how the math teacher is gay.  It's about the lawyer who's in a real bind trying to figure out how to go about defending the killer, until the answer magically falls into his lap.  It's about how good old Patrick Ducharme from Perfect Match now has a crush on Judge Alex (the girl's mother, remember?)  It's about a lot of things.  But mainly, it's about school shootings and how bullying can contribute to the madness, with a bunch of confusing subplots thrown in to get us through the 400 pages.    I feel that this is a very important subject, and I applaud Picoult for taking it on.  But I think it's a very complex topic and needs to be handled with a lot of care.  I think she bit off more than she could chew, and, as a result, I feel she kept coming back to the same basic ideas and repeating them over and over.  She doesn't seem to have a story so much as she has a really good idea for one.      The characters felt flat to me.  For instance, Josie.  In some ways, she felt realistic, but I felt like Picoult could have gone more in depth with her.  I don't know much about her except for the fact that she's a 17 year old girl who doesn't have an identity of her own.  But deep down, there must be more to her than that, even if Josie doesn't know what it is.  Josie deliberately holds important info from the reader until the last minute, so that the ending can come as a shock.  I just found that to be coy.      The killer, Peter, is little more than the victim who becomes a victimizer.  He also plays a brief stint as \\"That sullen, ungrateful teen boy all mothers dread but worry they'll end up with eventually.\\"      Another thing, there are way too many characters coming and going, too many points of view shifts.  Sometimes we'll go into someone's head just to learn what they were doing at the time of the shooting.  And then that person will virtually disappear from the story, only to show up later on the witness stand so that she can recount info we already know.  Sometimes we'll go into a character's head 300 pages into the book, and we'll have no memory of who that person is, but we'll know they were in the school somewhere during the time of the shooting and that's why they're on the witness stand right now.  I think that Picoult got the characters confused at times (that's how many of them there were).  I noticed at least one typo in the book, where a mysterious, come-and-go character was referred to by one of the dead kids' names.  There are so many characters in this book that Picoult ran out of names for them and had to use the name Whit for two different people.   I understand that it's hard to write a book like this without including a large cast of characters.  I just felt that she was having trouble juggling them all, and that made it hard for me as a reader.  She could have chosen, I don't know, maybe only a dozen of them to focus on.  By the way, am I the only one who kept getting the names Peter and Patrick confused?      I think that this would have been a more powerful book if, instead of turning it into the obligatory courtroom drama, she had just written a story told from the points of view of several of the victims, shortly before their lives changed forever.  Yeah, it would have been a little like Elephant, but I'm sure she could havemade it a unique and interesting story regardless.  And it would have been interesting to have a section told from Peter's point of view (a section in which we actually learned from HIM how he felt at the time of the killings), a section told from Josie's point of view, a section told from the individual victims' points of view and a section told from Peter's mother's point of view.  I feel like we didn't learn much about the victims, and I think that's a shame.  Matt was just the typical abusive boyfriend with only the smallest twinges of humanity in there.  And the rest of the kids were only mentioned long enough to establish the neat little boxes they fit into---\\"the popular girl,\\"  \\"the jock,\\" \\"the minister's kid,\\" \\"the Down Syndrome girl,\\" etc. If I hadn't read the page on Wikipedia, I wouldn't have been able to keep track of who died and who didn't.  It's fine for the day of the shooting to feel like a video game to Peter, but the reader needs to feel more than that for the victims.  I had a hard time thinking of the kids as really being gone and lost forever because they never felt real to me in the first place.  That's why I think it would have been so much more powerful if we got to see more of what their lives had been like while they were alive.  You know, high school is not just divided into two groups---the popular and the unpopular.  For many people, that's what high school is like, and that's the view of high school that we get from made for TV movies and problem novels and teen dramas, but there is more to teen life than just drugs, alcohol, sex and bullying.  And while I admire Picoult for bringing our attention to these kinds of issues, I want to read about all the subtle nuances of teen life, not just the melodramatic moments.     I think Picoult is a fine writer.  There are some really poignant insights in here, even if she does, at times, get a bit redundant and over-analytical.  But in this book, she really needed a primary focus.  I think that focus should have been on the victims who were killed, and on the boy who killed them.
B000R7HY0K|1.0|Pretentious doesn't really cover it.  This is a terrible movie.  I couldn't even make it to the action which I assume is in the second half.  I have only walked out or cut short a few movies in my life.  This is one of them.  Amazon needs a zero rating.  This should never have been made.
B000002U6E|5.0|\\"Cross of Changes \\"proved to be Cretu's greatest achievement.  \\"Cross of Changes\\" was antithesis of his first release.  The music theme was a far departure from his dark and sexual first recording. Cretu's mixing of Native American hymns, monk tunes, along with other worldwide chants made this music very unique.    Like others here, this release contained my favorite songs from Enigma the guitar laden \\"I love you, I'll kill you\\" and \\"The Eyes of Truth\\".  Others, the ever popular \\"Return to Innocence\\", the mesmerizing \\"Carly Song\\"  and the native American theme \\" Silent Warrior\\" proved to be his best.    Not only the music was spectacular but so were his music videos. The videos really enhanced his music. The best music video of all time, for me, is \\"Return To Innocence\\".  The video wasn't direct rather it left the viewer to have his own interpretation.  It was very thought provoking about life and death.  \\"The Eyes of Truth\\" with its images from India and along with the music was absolutely stunning.  \\"Carling Song\\" a floaty escape was another astonishing video.  \\"Cross Of Changes\\" was Cretu's most spiritual and amazing work to date.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Robert de Niro and Al Pacino together again after such a long period [they have only shared two movies - The Godfather Part II and Heat]seemed like a surefire winner. Instead, I felt like I was ripped off - the writing was bad, the acting was so-so, and the plot was just hackneyed. I really should have known better after Pacino's last effort \\"88 Minutes\\", another tepid thriller.<br /><br />Okay, so maybe I'm exaggerating - it's not that Righteous Kill is a completely bad movie, but it's the unfulfilled expectations of seeing two legends paired together to make a really good movie that proved it's undoing.<br /><br />De Niro plays \\"Turk\\" and Pacino plays \\"Rooster\\", two NY cops who've been around for a while, perhaps too long. A serial killer is on the prowl, offing acquitted criminals and an earlier scene with Turk confessing to the crimes naturally makes viewers think he is the suspect. But the flow of the movie just doesn't mesh with the development of the main characters - in the end, the revelations don't really shock and the characters appear pretty much one-dimensional.<br /><br />I also felt that these two veteran actors and screen legends left it too late to make an on-screen appearance together - they are both in their late 60's and it shows. There is no sense of presence and we don't get any indication that these are acting heavyweights - much of the blame goes to the bad direction as well as the tepid plot, but part of it is also because these two are unconvincing in their roles here.

B001EIOOVS|4.0|American Gangster (Blu-Ray) / B001EIOOVS<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />This is a fascinating movie, something akin to the Godfather series, but with a serious and critical look at police misconduct. I cannot say with any authority how accurate this movie is, in comparison with the actual history, but the drama here is fantastic and worth taking in.<br /><br />American Gangster is the story of a poor Harlem black man who takes over the business and leadership of the area's most influential and recently deceased small-time crime lord, and builds a drug empire with his own two hands. Drugs are shipped in directly from Vietnam, via military planes, and are flooded onto the streets at high purities and low prices. And in the midst of all this, corrupt police simultaneously threaten and protect the drug dealers, working the system to milk it for all it is worth.<br /><br />There are several things I like about this movie, several points that undermine popular Hollywood conventions. Frank Lucas is not presented as an oppressed angel, nor as a lionized dark hero. He is a character with control and caution, but this control is not deemed as a virtue, and it is made clear than violence simmers under the surface, when he attacks employees and family members who have foolishly failed to adopt his careful control. And Richie Roberts, our intrepid detective, is presented  carefully, with plenty of flaws. Rather than use his numerous affairs to build up his character as a 'real' man, it is made clear that he is a somewhat shallow human being, who cares more about winning than about his son, and who does not cut off contacts with known criminals who are old friends.<br /><br />I appreciate that this movie is careful to show the casualties of the drug empire built by Frank Lucas. Unlike The Godfather (which I am fond of, make no mistake), where you rarely remember (or care) what the family is selling, you never forget that Lucas is selling hard drugs. And no matter where you stand on legalization, you recognize that flooding a market used to 5% purity with a product that is nearly 100% purity, and without warning, is going to result in some pretty gruesome overdoses. And it does.<br /><br />In the end, though, what I like most about this movie is that Roberts isn't just interested in the drug dealers - he wants the crooked cops, too. He recognizes that crooked cops are a danger to society and a smirch on his own standing as a cop, and he works within the system to improve the system. And that is something we need more of, both in real life and from Hollywood.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing. I do not own this movie - I rented this through my Blockbuster Online account. I enjoy the movie immensely and am considering purchasing a copy for my home library.flooding a market used to 5% purity with a product that is nearly 100% purity, and without warning, is going to result in some pretty gruesome overdoses.

0440242576|3.0|I may be one of the few who has not read Grisham before. I enjoy films of his stories and read this novella to see why so many read Grisham. I was attracted by the theme - Skipping Christmas.<br /><br />Here is the master craftsman at work. Grisham's writing is lucid. He clearly sets out the scene and introduces the characters, so well he gets away with a cardinal sin in writing - jumping from one character head to another. The pace never slows and builds tension to climax which is foreshadowed but not given away. The ending is appropriate for a classic moral Christmas tale.<br /><br />So why has Skipping Christmas drawn such mixed reviews? Why do some hate it? The title is fitting but none of the characters are likable. Not even the protagonist, who is a wimp and that must be a sin for a Grisham reader. In parts, the story line is predictable, and yet implausible character action. Whilst appropriate the ending feels like an after-thought.<br /><br />I guess some publishing editor told Grisham he should have a Christmas tale in his stable. Grisham should have skipped Christmas which is what it feels he really wanted to do.<br /><br />Nonetheless, the writing quality makes Skipping Christmas an easy-read novella, and it is a pleasure to 'watch' the master craftsman at work.<br /><br />just Jack again.
B0012Q732O|4.0|10,000 B.C. / B0012Q732O<br /><br />*Spoilers*<br /><br />This is a fun romp through a variety of mish-mashed primitive societies and locales - there's frozen mountainous country, fevered jungle terrains, and arid deserts of both the African and Egyptian flavors. The action starts early and stays at a decently fevered pitch; the love story is well done and never lapses into boredom.<br /><br />The best part about this movie isn't really the plot but in the little extra character touches included. For once, we have a damsel in distress who remains calm and reasonably collected in the face of peril, leaves clues, and proactively swipes a knife from her captors. If we must have captive females, I admire a strong and realistic stoic-yet-hopeful attitude in said captive female. We also have African \\"supporting\\" characters who are allowed to outshine the \\"main\\" characters: the African tribes that rally in support of the hero are composed of individual, brave, witty, intelligent people, not just some token leader and a handful of grunting followers. To top it all off, we have a wise old mentor who manages to stay alive for *most* of the movie, and a missing father who (quite realistically) *stays* missing, rather than being trotted out as a Deus Ex Machina in the final act.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie partly for the front-and-center plot, but mostly for the extra touches that buck the accepted movie stereotypes that we all labor under. Don't go into it expecting a masterpiece because you won't get one, but this is a perfect way to waste a cold evening at home.<br /><br />This version provides a closed caption option for the hard of hearing.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll

6304493665|4.0|This is an interesting movie that explores the concepts of capitol punishment. The movie claims to be neutral, but it does seem to be against it.<br /><br />Very quickly, Sister Helen Prejean (Susan Sarandon) is visiting Sean Penn who is sentenced to die for having a part in killing 2 teenagers. Sarandon tries to be compassionate, but she realizes that Penn at the very least has issues. She is trying to get Penn to believe in Jesus (seeing that his days are numbered). Penn denies responsibility for the deaths of the teenagers, so Sarandon does everything within her power to see that he gets fair chances of appeals. Needless to say, the parents of the victims just want Penn executed. (This begins an interesting subplot that will come full circle.)<br /><br />Penn may have gotten some miles in his pleas, but he makes the DUMB mistake of praising Adolf Hitler on television. Granted, innocent people have been arrested and executed, but Penn has now shown his 'issues' on television for all to see. Needless to say, Sarandon is annoyed.<br /><br />Perhaps due to Penn's acting abilities, we come to care about his character despite his crimes and mental issues. We then see that his execution is inevitable, and Sarandon has to go through the difficult job of being at Penn's side to the end. The methods of execution start to look cold and calculating. And we start to wonder what gives us the right to take the life of even a criminal. We can see that Sarandon gets little help from those she should. While the Prison Chaplain coldly says: \\"The Old Testament says 'an eye for an eye,' Sarandon bitterly counters it: \\"What about the NEW Testament where Jesus says: 'A man is greater than his worst sin?'\\"<br /><br />There is some release of tension as Penn has a moment with his family. Once he confesses his guilt, the writer does not allow our newly won sympathy for Penn to slack for a moment. It will in fact increase right up until the end. Sarandon's arguably strongest moment is when she tells Penn to just keep his eyes on her face as sentence is carried out. In a way, Penn does have a final triumphant moment when he can honestly say: \\"Killing is wrong, whether it's me who does it, or your government.\\" In other words, Penn has shown his executioners as well as others that they have become what they accused him of being.<br /><br />If you are for capitol punishment, you are probably not going to like this movie. But if you are against it, you probably will like it a lot despite its profound sadness.p his eyes on her face as sentence is carried out.

B001HZ9ABM|5.0|This is a stunningly well done remastering of the Bee Gees' tremendously well-crafted 4th US album, and a must-have! The sound quality is markedly better than previous CD reissues of this album. The sparkling clarity of the acoustic guitars, pianos, and strings, as well as the subtle nuances of the vocals and slightly delayed reverb on instruments for spacial effect and dimension is captured brilliantly, as never before. Listening to this remaster, clean and beautiful as it is, it's hard to believe this album was recorded 40 years ago! The outtakes and never before released gems are a real treat too. Hats off to all involved for a job spectacularly well done, and definitely worth owning!

B0001932ZA|5.0|There are two bits of music from opera, both used by Dynamo the stalker.  The one he plays, the Ride of the Walkures, is conventionally used as tough-guy-going-into-combat music.  But the other, the one he sings, is from the aria \\"Vedro mentr'io sospiro\\" from THE MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.  It's originally a villian's blustering confession to the audience of his secret weakness, a sexually frustrated Count raging at being outwitted by his servants.  When he sings the line Dynamo actually sings \\"... quest'anima consola, e jubilar mi fa!\\", he's resolving to avenge himself by forcing one of the servants to marry a woman old enough to be his mother. Whoever chose it for a stalker's war-cry was very clever.

0554362287|5.0|RHJ is certainly the best Wodehouse novel although some of the Mulliner, Golf, and Ukridge short stories may score higher if you're giving points for brevity (\\"pound for pound\\" funnyness).  On the other hand, maybe not.  Every line of RHJ is funny and beautiful as well.  Yes, as another reviewer said, it's easy to read, but it also rewards rereading many times.  Like Mozart, it's quite a bit more complicated than it sounds at first.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: Do not read further until you have read the book!<br /><br />Question to consider AFTER reading: is Bertie a Christ-figure?  He does, after all, redeem the story's universe through his suffering.  Which is caused by (apparent) betrayal.  And, to which he is more-or-less legitimately condemned for stirring up the community.  If yes, how many Passion-analogues can get away with having the Christ-figure be the first-person narrator?  How many succeed this well at getting the reader to identify with him?  Not many.  As I said, I think this piece may be deeper than it appears.

A lot of the moves are ballet based from barre work, they lengthen and strengthen.    You will need a set of hand weights.

Probably too rocked-out for his folk-oriented listeners and they might be offended by his putting the hippie era behind him with \\"Hippie Dream\\": \\"And the wooden ships [think Jefferson Airplane] / Are a hippie dream / Capsized in excess / ...

0553582038|3.0|When I read A Game of Thrones, I was amazed. The book took me on a journey where I identified with nearly every character. The varied plot lines had a unified theme and led to a unifying point and every plot twist had me cheering or groaning. At one point I was so angry at a turn of events that I actually threw the book across the room and swore not to finish it... a vow I kept for 15 minutes. It was too good and I had to know what happened next.<br /><br />This was the power of Martin's work. Each of the following works maintained this lofty standard and I raced through them, often staying up into the wee hours of the morning to get the next detail.<br /><br />The style of the book to follow and switch between multiple points of view to advance multiple plot lines is intriguing and I would constantly groan in disappointment when a chapter would end and the point of view would switch, only to be immediately recaptured by that plot line and groan again when it would switch to yet another.<br /><br />I say all of this to give everyone an idea of what this book is not. It is none of those things. There is no visible unifying theme and the book reminded me in many ways of the later books in Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. Martin seems intent on indulging his every whim and the once-amazing plot is quickly spiraling into a disjointed array of mini-stories with no connection and no allure.<br /><br />This is the first book where I found my attention wandering and where the events that moved the plot along came as small reliefs to the tedium of the book as a whole. I several times found myself saying \\"finally, something happened.\\"<br /><br />All that said, the core is still there and Martin is still an impressive and interesting author. Some of the character development is absolutely fantastic. Especially the story line involving Jaime. Part of my dislike for the piece is that it really relies too heavily on character development, which is a critique only because of the parity between plot and character in the previous books. There is little plot development and it is apparent where things are heading long before they get there.<br /><br />In the end, this is a character-driven novel that really compares unfavorably to the previous books in the series but for all that is still a good book. Thats the problem with setting the bar so high, as Martin did with A Game of Thrones. I hope A Dance With Dragons regains his lost momentum.the previous books.

1594481784|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensly! It was extremly funny, heartbeaking and very English. That is why I never understood making the film in Chicago of all places! I'm not sure if there was any uproar as close to the type caused when it was decided that Ren&eacute;e Zellwiger was to play Brigit Jones but there damn well should have been! In the case of this book the people creating an uproar would have been dead on in their protest. Not only filming it in Chicago with an all American cast but choosing John f***ing Cusak as the narrator (dear GOD)!<br /><br />So beside the horrible decisions I just mentioned, this book is a masterpiece! Extremly well written for a modern look at love and relationships but a completely original storyline that examines his not only currect failing relationship but an his examining of his past as well.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed but I seriously stress that you read his books before you decide to see any of the films they've adapted into mediocre movies.<br /><br />Hornby is a genious that I'm sure you'll find a lot of what you not only been through (woman or man) but I'm sure you'll recognize yourself in his very cleverly written humour.
B000UH8BTK|5.0|I was a big fan of the early Weather Report records. I bought cd copy of \\"Heavy Weather\\" but none of the others. This fills my void at a great price. The packaging is simple but I wasn't expecting much. It is a bit of a curiosity that \\"Heavy Weather\\" wasn't included since that was their best seller. Perhaps Sony/BMG presumed that most, like me, would already have it in cd form. I would have prefered having their first record, \\"Weather Report\\", or \\"Tale Spinnin'\\" over \\"Night Passage\\" but that's quibbling.
0743290119|3.0|I was disappointed in this book after reading The Devil Wears Prada.  It was slightly entertaining though so not a total waste of time.
B000O5B4C4|4.0|Finally in my opinion Lions Gate got a Blu Ray Transfer right. It is not perfect but it is good condidering Basic Instinct was released in 1992.    Picture quality was good during day scenes but a little grainy when a scene gets dark. Sound quality is good as well (DTS HD Audio).    All the extras are in Standard Definition. This is great Blu Ray to own. Price is also great :)
0307269752|5.0|I finished reading this wonderful book last week and am still thinking about it.  I loved it so much that I ordered the second one, \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire\\", from the UK because the US edition will not be published until July, 2009.<br /><br />I loved this book!!  It has a very intriguing storyline and the author did a superb job developing the main characters. It is a mystery thriller and keeps you guessing.  It is set in Sweden, which is interesting, but it is really Mikael Blomkvist( a journalist) and Lisbeth Salander (a tattooed computer hacker) that makes you want to hurry and read the next book.<br /><br />I hear there will be a total of 3 books in this series. Very enjoyable!!
B001H5X7KC|2.0|Watch it at the movies, loved it. Finally got my hands on the Blu Ray and was extremelly dissapointed with the picture quality. Parts of the movie the quality really played to the strengths of Blu Ray whereas some parts especially when it is dark it snows on screen!!!!    I can understand if it is made in the 80s or the 90s but this was a movie released in 2008??!! What the F???!!!    The sound on the other hand is good as with most Blu Ray releases.    It is a pity about the pic quality, as this is a great movie and the Blu Ray extras are awesome.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Tombstone is an important credit for not only moviemaking but also for the western genre. The film evolves around the story of the Earp brothers, facing their enemies - the Clanton's, the cowboys, and Wyatt Earp's(Kurt Russell] friendship with the once upon a time Dentist, Doc Holliday, played out brilliantly by Val Kilmer.    This movie is partly truth and part fiction and is also true to realistic, portraying a symbol of the old west like no other, revealing what it takes to survive in the hard times of the wild frontier, and what it takes to gain one's respect with a muzzle of a bad .44...actually Wyatt Earp rarely carried a gun and used intimadation for a lethal weapon against his many confrontations, where as it was the complete opposite with Doc Holliday, who would many times shoot at the drop of a hat, with speculation that ol' Doc may have fired the first shot at an unarmed Ike Clanton, starting off the fireworks at the O.K. Corral. - This \\"vista series\\" dvd is the ultimate \\"TOMBSTONE\\" for your western collection featuring, documentaries, 16x9 widescreen and a reprint of the real map drawn out by Wyatt Earp - his account of the most famous shootout in western history. The directors cut is actually only five minutes additional footage.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Incrediable, unbelievable, awesome eye-candy!!! If you want to experience the full potiential of your blu-ray player and your 1080p HDTV :)& learn at the same time :), Planet Earth Blu-Ray Disc will blow you away!!! The picture and sound are a sight to see and hear. The animals and scenic locations seem to pop right out of the screen!! By far the best Blu-Ray experience I have seen. Worth every penny, I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to witness the best of your home entertainment system. Also Amazon shipped it very quickly, it was on my door steps within 4 days. Two thumbs way up!!!!
B001MW0J2E|2.0|I have never listened to Animal Collective before Merriweather PP. But I don't get what the big deal is about this album. I bought it based on review hype, without listening first, against my better judgement. MPP strikes me as a kind of Beach Boys on acid. Reminds me of Mercury Rev, Spiritualized... I listened to the whole thing, only once, admittedly, but my feeling is that I can't imagine getting seriously into it without drugs. One song flows into the next creating a kind of prog rock &#34;concept album&#34; feel, but I found the music to be way too reverb, echo, delay, creating a very dreamlike ambience but never setting down and saying HERE's something for you! It's a big blur. If you like that kind of thing, okay. I'll listen to it a few more times to see if it begins to speak to me but I don't give it much hope.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|I absolutely love The Fame. Its a great dance cd that never lets up. Its lyrics are creative and innovative, and the beats would make even the most boring person want to get up and dance. People have commented that lady gaga has ripped off Christina Aguilera...which is bull. If anything its the other way around, and while Christina butchers the electronic pop world with god awful hits Keeps gettin better, and dynamite. Lady gaga delivers exactly what it should sound like. With dance fueled hits Just Dance, LoveGame, StarStruck, Pokerface, Money Honey, I Like It Rough, The Fame, and Beautiful Dirty Rich. This is a grand debut for the 22 yr old Lady Gaga...all ready being hailed as the future of pop music, with her crazy lyrics, and beats, as well as her retro, yet futuristic look and sound. She's one of a kind, and loves it. Will be interesting to see how she matures on her next album...but until then just enjoy every moment of the FAME!
B000002MG1|5.0|If there is going to be an album R.E.M. will always be remembered for, this is it. One of these extremely rare cases, even for very big bands, where an album is so filled with pure inspiration, creating a whole that is much much more than just the sum of its parts. Even in some of your most beloved albums, you will probably pick a couple of tracks which are the true highlights and also a couple of others that do not quite keep up with the rest. And here is the triumph of AFTP. Maybe there is no \\"Losing my Religion\\"-caliber single song, clearly standing out, but all of the tracks are of such a high quality that there is no uneven part in the ensemble and picking a \\"best\\" becomes virtually impossible. There are plenty of tracks here to easily make it in any top-10 R.E.M. songs list - \\"Drive\\", \\"Nightswimming\\", \\"Everybody Hurts\\", \\"Man on the Moon\\", \\"Find the River\\", \\"Try not to Breathe\\". No other R.E.M. album, pre or post ATFP can claim so many.     A beautiful, heartfelt, harmonic listening experience with inspired string arrangements and magical lyrics that causes an avalanche of emotions and stays with you forever. The very best in the history of a very important band.
B001HN6972|5.0|I have just seen The Reader and find the film fascinating.  However, after reading some of the reviews posted below, I concluded that the timeline of events were missed by some viewers and that some were expecting a more tightly woven ending. I will address the former, but the latter is more like real life, composed of loose ends and no clear answers. I will refrain from giving away the plot twists, preferring to allow the viewer to enjoy the unfolding plot.      To clarify, the narrative timeline is important and the questions the story raises are still relevant.  The male lead, Michael meets Winslet's character Hannah first in 1958, AFTER the war.  Whatever she did in the war is part of her past when they have their affair. He would have been a small child in the war, he is fifteen when they meet, and in his early 20s in law school. Her sudden disappearances and many of her choices are dictated by a personal secret that has dire consequences later, when Michael, now a law student, sees her again in a courtroom.     The viewer must understand that post war Germany felt, and still feels shame over the Holocaust and faced serious challenges when it was over and the nation had to answer for crimes against humanity. It's difficult to say what any of us would do in the same circumstances.  We were not there. Would a person be swept along?  Would they rationalize?  Would they act in fear? In habitual obedience?  What role does ignorance play?  Can someone who is capable of great kindness, even tenderness, also be capable of evil, of knowing unthinking cruelty? Does one act nullify the other? What is the punishment when a whole nation is held in thrall? It's all easy to answer from a point of safety and security.    Watch the film for Winslet and Kross, who are astounding in the lead roles, watch it for the lessons it offers and the questions it asks.  Too often we are satisfied with pure entertainment in the theater, this film is a chance to take away something more.
B000002IV8|5.0|I used to listen to Overkill-I hear black all the time,I had it on cassette when I was a kid( I was in the 5th or 6th grade at the time) and since then it's always been one of my favorite albums of all time,that and The Killing Kind were my absolute favorite.What more is there to say about Overkill?The have awesome guitar and drum work,the vocalist is great, and I must admit Overkill's older albums are great but if you start from their older stuff and work your way up..you'll notice their sound becomes more focused,which is rare for most artists.I highly recommend this classic thrash metal CD!
B001AJVR5M|5.0|My daughter loves to play this as loud as she can and I find myself singing along to some of the songs.  At least thats a plus!
B000ZM1MGE|2.0|In early seventies life was turbulent the person in real life was actually a drug addict,later died due to AIDS.  He did sell his movie wrights and the producer made the movie based on who payed him for appropriate purpose,the movie could be much more quality if any of the charecters were actually Turkish which were not  prison not vacation spot,in those years some movies were made about Soviet prisons I have watched when I was kid anybody could tell some scenes were intentionally showed almost Satanic and evil,
B0018ARMW0|5.0|One of my favorite albums.Just bought it recently and it rivals all heavy metal greats.Straight out guitar and heavy bass and drums.Weird keyboard sound not as prevalent.This dying soul and In the name of God are EPIC.
031606792X|2.0|This book is great for a 13 - 18 year old with a vivid imagination and one who fantasies about vampires. For the people who live in the real world and are over 18, I wouldn't waste my time or money. I unfortunately had to waste my money because it was on my 15 year old daughters Xmas list.
B000N196CO|1.0|You wanna watch a real version of 'The Rose of Versaille', I highly recommend the animated version instead. I'm just so glad that this film was uploaded on YouTube, both in English and Spanish.  The story depicts semi-factual events about the French Revolution, but not as accurately as the animated film version of this story.    Save your bucks on this one and log into YouTube. You won't regret it.
B001O22ELQ|5.0|I enjoyed this completely.  I was actually expecting it to be more off-track than it really was from other comments and reviews that I had seen.  I should have remembered one thing: Joss Whedon.  Meaning sure, it's fun and completely silly, but it's still a bit dark and he's gonna kick you in the gut sooner or later.  I can't wait to share it with my friends.    UPDATE: 03/24/11    Okay, it's been over 2 years since I first saw this. Some \\"changes\\" have taken place for me.  I no longer enjoy it...I LOVE it!  I have shared it with every friend I have. I have watched it more times than any other show or movie ever (even Star Wars and Disney's Beauty and The Beast that was on constant play because it was a certain 3-year old's favorite).  When I can't see it, I listen to it.  I have actually purchased this 4 times: first was here on Amazon as the download, then I bought the DVD here as a gift for the above-mentioned 3-yr old who has grown up and loves musicals (he loved Dr. Horrible!), then I couldn't get my own Amazon download transferred to my iPod without some technical stuff that I didn't understand (sci-fi geek, not techie) so I purchased it again from iTunes, then I again came back to Amazon to purchase the DVD again for myself so I could have the special features.  So yes, I own this in 3 different formats, even after I originally saw it online for free.  Even with the 3 versions, I sometimes find myself wanting to watch it when I don't have any of those with me so I have also watched it more than once on hulu (although it doesn't seem to be on hulu anymore) and Netflix.    I find myself hoping for another strike (c'mon actors!) just so they could have time to do another one!
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this flash about a year ago & it works beautifully. Will provide lots of light for great pictures, I use it w/a Nikon D40x. Made a great flash for night time pictures in Paris in the last year - and I angered quite a few people trying to get candid shots on the Paris Metro! I recommend this flash highly to anyone who's serious about photography.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|Here is the thing about this movie, it was billed and marketed as a monster movie.  All the  hype built up around the movie was on wondering what type of monster it would be, whether it was a new Godzilla film or some alien invasion, the point conveyed through marketing was that it was a monster movie.  Two things contradicted this though.    1. Let me say that I get suspense, I understand a need for a build up, but to have maybe the last 10 minutes of an hour and a half film show the monster that, and remember this was the primary reason many went to go see this film, was a definite rip-off.  Which leads me to #2    2. This movie is not, and there cannot be enough emphasis on the words is not, a monster movie in the traditonal sense.  This movie is about the people involved in a disaster created by the monster, for the purpose of this movie you could have replaced the monster with a fire, a meteor, an earthquake, or the Stay Puft man, the point is that the creature is just background, the focus of this movie are the kids.    Now some of you may be saying that there isn't aything wrong with that, that the idea sounds interesting, and thats fine, just remember though, it wasn't marketed as that, it was marketed as a monster movie.  if there is one thing I can't stand its a lie and thats what this was, a lie to get the public interested and then a delivery of not only a completely different movie, but a sub-par one at that.
B000EHSVOG|5.0|I think it was Siskel and Ebert who coined the phrase \\"guilty pleasure\\" for a film that you know has no real depth, but that you can't help but love anyway.  For me, Towering Inferno is that film.  No subtlety here, just a hugely enjoyable film.  It helps immensely, of course, that it stars Steve McQueen and Paul Newman at the height of their fame.  (It occurred to me when Paul Newman recently passed away that his career had an odd trajectory:  I think he peaked during the period between Butch Cassidy (1969) and Towering Inferno (1974).  He was already 44 in 1969; a little unusual I think for a romantic lead/action star to peak in his late forties.)      The two-disc special edition has a good group of extras.  There is a raft of deleted scenes, mostly from the extended version originally shown on television.  Apparently the quality of these mostly brief snippets was not sufficiently high for them to be used to create and extended version of the film for this DVD.  Most are from the early part of the film, before Steve McQueen enters, and cutting them helps the pacing of the film.  The one exception is a couple of scenes with Robert Wagner - one longish complete scene and part of another scene - whose omission hurts the film by making it unclear who exactly Robert Wagner is and why we should care when he is put in deadly jeopardy midway through the film.  A good part of Susan Blakely's appearances also ended on the cutting room floor.  Among other bonus features, there are several interesting - but short - \\"making of\\" featurettes, both from the time of the film's original release and from 2006 when this DVD was being prepared.   With different accounts of the making of the film, some of the information provided can be a bit contradictory.  For instance, we are told at one point that Paul Newman was cast first as the architect and Steve McQueen was then cast as the fire captain, and at another point that Steve McQueen was given his choice of which role to play and when he chose the fire caption, Paul Newman was offered the other role.  All in all, if you are a fan of this movie, the special edition version will be a great treat.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Not sure the casual listener will understand the sigificance of this release. Of all Paul's recordings this is the closest to a Beatle-like later 1/2 of 1960s production...less the big ballad. If Chaos and Creation was \\"stripped down\\" Paul and Memory Almost Full \\"proper\\" Paul and both very good CDs .. this is Paul \\"on steroids\\" and to me is a great recording and his most musical effort since Ram. More melody here than some of his peers have mustered in an entire career. Youth obviously deserves some credit here for creating an environment that inspired McCartney to create music as he would as a 25 to 30 yr old (while others his age have resorted doing duet albums or covers to chart). Clearly McCartney's prolific output has put him in a market over exposure position but make no mistake... this record stands out. For John Lennon fans (which I am) ..this would have been John's favorite Paul Album. Appreciate Paul McCartney while he is still around.
B0015519VS|4.0|I'm a Usher fan and have been since the beginning.  Although, I must admit usually I don't listen to Usher's product once they are released because he tends to be over saturated on the radio.  Again, with \\"Here I stand\\" I don't listen to it much.  However, I have paid attention to the singles released from this cd.  When \\"Love in this club\\" was released, one might have thought that Usher was going to storm the charts like he did on his last effort \\"Confessions\\".  And while the single performed well, subsequent single(s)didn't quite catch on (\\"Moving Mountains\\")  But as \\"Trading Places\\" began to be rotated on radio stations I began to really take notice.  So I decided to listen to Usher's cd and try and figure out why it's not blazing the charts like it's predecessor.      I've come to the conclusion that \\"Here I Stand\\" probably falls into the Adult Contemporary category.  What is missing from this cd is the jittery beats that \\"Confessions\\" seem to have.  I usually check credits, but it didn't seem like Jermaine Dupri was present much on this offering.  That isn't a bad thing.  I realized that this is a really good cd that definitely shows Usher moving into grown folks territory.  The only thing that causes this offering to not be like it's predecessor is that it's a bit more mature.  Another highlight of the cd is the title track.  Kudos to Usher for making a grown up cd.  Hmmm, I think I will be rotating this cd like I've never done before.
0956010903|5.0|The item was delivered on time and in excellent condition. The book looked great with extras that were worth the extra cost for the collectible edition.
B0000C9ZBW|3.0|This watch is very simple, very slim, very minimal. It looks pretty nice; it's a bit out of place with casual wear and not quite up to formal wear. It keeps time accurately, is easy to set, and impossible to change accidentally.    3 complaints:    1) The price is actually quite unreasonable. For the same $95, any number of less elegant-looking watches will give you alarms, data storage, month/day/year, stopwatch, etc. There's absolutely no features here, so you're paying for style only. And style-wise, it's only decent. Which brings me to my next point:    2)The images shown on Amazon are a little too good for the watch. Somebody did a really fine job of product photography. In real life, the face is extremely shallow, while the photo gives it the appearance of a bit of a deep, elegant bevel. As a result, the face loses a lot of that contrast from the pictures once you see it in normal conditions. Also, the buckle looks like a matte black online, almost leather-like. In the real-world version, it's very glossy and feels a bit cheap (it doesn't clasp down tightly enough, either, and jingles when you move your wrist). There's other differences as well...all in all it looks more elegant in the pictures than in the real.    3) The strap adjustment is mediocre. The main problem is that the clasp, once adjusted, is held in place by a small tension lever. It works its way loose after a week of regular wear (if you're going to wear it regularly...). And, as mentioned earlier, the other part of the clasp (the part that fastens the watch) is too loose as well.    So, if you need a special occasion dress watch but don't want to spend big money, this is a good choice. For any and all other purposes, best to steer clear.
1416562605|5.0|'The White Tiger' chronicles the social ascent of a young Indian man, a poor nobody coming from a remote village who somehow makes it to the city (New Dehli) to become the chaffeur/factotum of his rich master.<br /><br />This is a plot-driven novel and the man's (mis)adventures and encounters will likely keep you glued to the book until the last page.<br />Therefore yes, this is an entertaining book and unafraid to show it! I'm saying this because I'm under the impression that nowadays there are many books out there where the author is too concerned about the 'social critique' part and leaves the fun out of the equation.<br /><br />This is not to say that 'social critique' is absent in the novel: the main character for instance comes out as a bit 'amoral' by our highly civilized standards but maybe the whole point is to hint at the fact that moral is a luxury people trying to scrape a living cannot afford (there are many passages hinting at that).<br />Also: the novel serves as a commentary on where India stands now, socially (there are a couple of things said on the caste system which I'm not able to comment since I'm not familiar with the Indian reality, but they do sound interesting...).<br /><br />You might share the author implied views or not but what remains, at the heart, is an excellent work of fiction, one which I could easily see translated into a motion picture (Slumdog Millionaire, anyone?).
067088278X|5.0|This book takes classic fairy tales and stories and turns them into rhymes.  \\"Mother Hubbard in the cellar I spy cinderella\\".  \\"Cinderella on the stairs I spy three bears\\" and so on.  It's really witty and the drawings are cute.  My daughter has loved this since she was a baby and she's now three.  she requests it often and we don't mind reading it.  Our one year old is now picking up the book and enjoying the ryhmes.  This book was a gift because their daughter liked it so much and I would recommend it to my friends as well.
0810970686|5.0|Greg Heffley, star of the Wimpy Kid books, is back in his third outing and he's brought a super-sized bag full of giggles and belly laughs with him.  Just like the previous two books, he's not taking prisoners.  He attacks readers, kids and adults, with commonsensical and unadulterated observations on how the world should work from a kid's point of view.<br /><br />Jeff Kinney, the author and illustrator of the series, still hasn't given up his day job as a computer game designer despite the fact that all three of his books have ended up on the New York Times bestseller list.  I've read interviews with him and he talks about how much he loves the job.  But thankfully he also enjoys writing about the times and troubles of Greg Heffley.<br /><br />Much of today's 9 to 12 year old fiction centers around fantasy and magic.  I enjoy a lot of those stories as well.  Most kids do.  But the grandest fantasy of all for a kid, and maybe for some of us who've never grown up, is our own lives.  Kinney really understands that and presents Greg's story with honesty and a real imagining of the world.<br /><br />You don't find magical weapons or quests in the Wimpy Kid books.  Well, unless of course Greg happens to be playing a role playing game with his friends (and sometimes his mom, a story you'll find in the second book).  What you do get is a wonderful look into a kid's world that young readers will instantly recognize as their own and older readers will remember going through.<br /><br />The books don't really have plots.  They meander through things and Kinney manages to link threads of stories, making gags play over and over again by raising the stakes or giving them subtle and sneaky twists.  Greg's perception of self and his place in the world is amazingly dead on.  Not only that, but the author hangs out his own dirty laundry (literally, when Greg goes to school and a pair of dirty underwear with his name on it falls out of his pants leg because he's too lazy to do his own laundry) on the pages.<br /><br />My eleven year old, who discovered the books first, got dibs on reading the book.  He was home sick for the day and I took him with me to get my weekly allergy shot.  I knew the book was out, had to have it, and picked it up at a local bookstore.  I also picked one up for my wife's coworker's daughter.  I had to share the goodness.<br /><br />Chandler started and finished the book on Tuesday, then went back and reread his favorite parts.  Several times during both readings he would come get me and share something that was going on.  Normally that would irritate me to a degree.  I like to read books on my own, without previews.  But the Wimpy Kid books can be read again and again.  They're even better when you share them with other people.  We've also been calling each other PLOOPY for the last couple of days.  You'll have to read the book to understand that reference.<br /><br />One of the themes that Kinney returns to again and again in the book is the relationship between fathers and sons.  As a father of four sons myself, I know there can be a lot of misunderstandings and disappointments.  On both sides.  But this book, and I don't know if Kinney intended it on purpose, presents a great argument for both sides--as well as a chance to get to understand each other.  Sons need to know that their fathers were once upon a time boys like themselves, and fathers need to remember what it's like to be a boy.  Boys don't really know how everything works or why everything's not about them or how they're supposed to fit in the world.  And fathers...well, actually I guess that doesn't change much.  Kinney provides enlightenment and reminder in one great and funny package.<br /><br />The trick that the author manages to pull off so well is the presentation of serious material in a slapstick environment.  People just reading the books for humor will get that, but Kinney writes so honestly that readers can't help noticing how much real life is packed into the pages.<br /><br />I loved Greg's plan to learn to become a jumping king by digging a hole three inches deep in his backyard then jumping out of it a hundred times.  The next day he would dig the hole twice as deep and jump out of it a hundred times again.  By the end of the fifth day, he hoped to be jumping like a kangaroo.  Of course, any adult would realize this was ridiculous, but it only takes a father about five seconds and a good dose of honesty to realize that at Greg's age he would have believed the same thing.<br /><br />My wife is fourth grade teacher.  She was out of town on Wednesday, but when Chandler and I talked to her, we told her about getting the new Wimpy Kid book.  She was appreciative of my getting a book for her coworker's daughter, but she also asked me why I didn't pick up a copy for her class.  At the time, I didn't think about it because my son and I were so involved flipping through the pages.  So that went on my To-do List.  Her class loves these books as well and they're always gone from her classroom library.<br /><br />I also told my allergy nurse about them.  She has a six year old who is an aggressive reader and likes to draw.  Chandler and I even showed her our copy of the book.  She was going to pick them up on her way home.<br /><br />I tell everybody with kids about these books.  They're written in a journal format, complete with lined pages.  The art doodles are fantastic, simple and compelling.  They're also easy enough that they can inspire the budding artist in every young kid.  Young writers and artists both get a good role model to follow in these books while trying to express their own talents.<br /><br />The beauty of these books is that you don't have to read them in any particular order.  You can pick up any one on an impulse buy and rest assured that you or your child will enjoy it.  The first two are out in paperback, but I'd really recommend picking the books up in hardcover.  These are books that will sit on your shelves for a long time and will be constantly reread.  They're excellent gifts to give to other children or grandchildren.<br /><br />One thing that my son noticed that I didn't is the fact that the books each cover a season.  The first book centered on Greg going back to school for the new year.  The second book led up to Christmas.

That leaves two more to come, but in a recent interview he stated that he may do as many as seven of the books.  I hope so because I'll be sad to see the Wimpy Kid grow up and no longer share his adventures with us.me a jumping king by digging a hole three inches deep in his backyard then jumping out of it a hundred times.  The next day he would dig the hole twice as deep and jump out of it a hundred times again.  By the end of the fifth day, he hoped to be jumping like a kangaroo.  Of course, any adult would realize this was ridiculous, but it only takes a father about five seconds and a good dose of honesty to realize that at Greg's age he would have believed the same thing.    My wife is fourth grade teacher.  She was out of town on Wednesday, but when Chandler and I talked to her, we told her about getting the new Wimpy Kid book.  She was appreciative of my getting a book for her coworker's daughter, but she also asked me why I didn't pick up a copy for her class.  At the time, I didn't think about it because my son and I were so involved flipping through the pages.  So that went on my To-do List.  Her class loves these books as well and they're always gone from her classroom library.    I also told my allergy nurse about them.  She has a six year old who is an aggressive reader and likes to draw.  Chandler and I even showed her our copy of the book.  She was going to pick them up on her way home.    I tell everybody with kids about these books.  They're written in a journal format, complete with lined pages.  The art doodles are fantastic, simple and compelling.  They're also easy enough that they can inspire the budding artist in every young kid.  Young writers and artists both get a good role model to follow in these books while trying to express their own talents.    The beauty of these books is that you don't have to read them in any particular order.  You can pick up any one on an impulse buy and rest assured that you or your child will enjoy it.  The first two are out in paperback, but I'd really recommend picking the books up in hardcover.  These are books that will sit on your shelves for a long time and will be constantly reread.  They're excellent gifts to giveto other children or grandchildren.    One thing that my son noticed that I didn't is the fact that the books each cover a season.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|I ripped-off that title blurb from reviewer Monkdude but it's such an apt description of \\"Gran Torino\\" I couldn't resist.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood stars as Korean War veteran and retired automaker Walt Kowalski, still living in the old Michigan neighborhood that's falling apart around him (which reminds me of my late grandfather in New Haven). Kowalski's wife has just passed away and he's as cantankerous as ever -- scowling and growling at everyone and everything, including his Hmong neighbors who hail from Laos. Something happens that warms his relations with this family and he slowly becomes closer to them than his own kids and grandchildren. He naturally takes on the father-figure role with the two Hmong teens, in particular mentoring Thao (Bee Vang) on how to be manly and productive. Unfortunately there's a brutal Asian gang that preys on the teens and serious tensions rise. A showdown is inevitable.<br /><br />If you can imagine Dirty Harry in the role as the Asian mentor in \\"The Karate Kid\\" and the teen as Asian instead of white you'd have a pretty good idea of \\"Gran Torino,\\" except that the violence is darker and there's profuse cussing throughout.<br /><br />\\"Gran Torino\\" is greatly entertaining throughout its runtime. Although it's a serious drama it's also consistently hilarious without being a comedy, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Some describe Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) as  racist but this isn't really so. His many racist remarks throughout the film are dispersed evenhanded across the board, whether the recipients are white, Asian, Black or Hispanic. I think he realizes we're all human beings and we all have our strengths and weaknesses, potential for good or bad, regardless of race. His sharp remarks are simply his way of breaking the ice with people and relating to them. He dishes it out but also takes it. I'm not saying it's right, just that it's the way he is. The fact that he isn't really racist is proven by the close relationship he develops with his Hmong neighbors -- closer than his own flesh and blood. Would a real racist be open to such a relationship?<br /><br />A lot of themes are addressed, including second chances -- it's never too late to make up for past mistakes even if you're almost 80 years old. Walt obviously failed to develop close relationships with his two sons but a new \\"son\\" is thrown into his lap as if a gift from above. This time's he's intent on doing it right.<br /><br />I liked the way the \\"generation gap\\" is blown to smithereens in the story. Walt and Thao aren't just father/son figures they're friends. I can't help but think of God and Moses (Exodus 33:11) and Jesus and his \\"friends\\" (John 15:14-15), but I digress.<br /><br />I also liked how the film addresses blood v.s. spirit. The story shows that spirit is thicker than blood. I'm not saying blood relations aren't important but truly precious souls are able to see and walk beyond kin or race parameters. Despite his gruff exterior, Kowalski is such a soul, which explains why he is able to BE Thao's spiritual father and friend. Blood doesn't prevent him from discerning his grandaughter as the spoiled brat she is and seeing Thao's humility and goodness despite his mistakes.<br /><br />There are many other important themes -- love, courage, sacrifice and redemption.<br /><br />Lastly, \\"Gran Torino\\" addresses some of the same issues as \\"Crash\\" but does it more effectively, not to mention humorously.<br /><br />PERSONAL GRADE: Aoser than his own flesh and blood.

B0019T9FL6|5.0|I've been looking forward to this album since Jennifer's show stopping performance in Dreamgirls. It's quite obvious that she can really sing, but I wondered what sound producers would develop for her.  I must say that I am not disappointed, and was blown away with the quality of this CD.<br /><br />Lyrically and emotively, this album is wonderful and refreshing. The lyrics for tracks 4, 9 and 10 especially hit close to home for me to hear someone singing about real life is a refreshing change from the senseless gibberish that we hear these days. There's also plenty of variety and something for every mood and taste. She has strong ballads, such as the Robin Thicke produced Giving Myself,  as well as You Pulled Me Through and Invisible. Pocketbook and My Heart are great for the hip-hop lovers, while His Only Woman, We Gon' Fight and If This Isn't Love  will satisfy R&B lovers and there's even a traditional gospel song at the end.  When I first took note of Jennifer in Dreamgirls, it was because of the emotion and passion in her voice - when she said she wasn't going, she meant it! And the same is true with several tracks on this CD, with We Gon' Fight and His Only Woman being among my favorites. This CD is definitely a must have!<br /><br />Jennifer's voice is beautiful and the songs are a good fit.  I love this disc and it's earned a spot in my car's CD changer. Enjoy!
B0000C8WYB|5.0|\\"Chante Piaf\\" (Songs of Piaf) was the first Mireille Mathieu CD I bought, and it amazed me.  How could I have been unaware of such a great and talented singer?  I had seen Mireille Mathieu on American television in the late 1960's, but had forgotten her.  All I remembered was she was a petite woman with a large voice, and was roughly my age.  I saw \\"Chante Piaf\\" in a CD catlogue in about 1996, and remembered her.  I bought the CD out of curiosity.  After I listened to it, I immediately wanted more of her CDs, but could not find more.  It was roughly five years before I found another Mireille Mathieu CD and ten before I was able to start a collection.  I now have forty of her CDs, and a number of her LPs.<br /><br />Her performances of the thirteen Piaf songs on this CD are wonderful.  Among the Piaf songs on the CD are: \\"La vie en rose\\" (A Rose-colored Life), Piaf's signature song; \\"Sous le ciel de Paris\\" (The Sky of Paris, aka \\"Under Paris Skies\\"); \\"Mon Dieu\\" (My God!); \\"Exodus\\"; \\"L'hymme a l'amour\\" (Hymn to Love); \\"Non, je ne regrette rien\\" (No, I have no regrets); and \\"Mon manege a moi\\" (Caught in My Own Trap) which is my favorite song on the CD. Many of these songs are classics.  So is Mireille Mathieu's performances of them.<br /><br />Addendum 2012:  The original CD which I bought was distributed by Atlantic Records in 1993.  Since then it has been re-released in 2003 by Capitol and in 2012 by Ariole (Sony Music Germany).  In the latest re-release, Ms Mathieu has recorded three new songs which have been added: \\"A quoi ca sert l'amour\\" (What good is love?); \\"Les trois cloches\\" (The three bells); and \\"La goualante du pauve Jean\\" (The tale of poor Jean).  Those Americans with long memories will recognize these two final songs as hits here in the late 1950's.  The Three Bells was a hit by The Browns after it was converted to English, and \\"La goualante du pauve Jean\\" was an instumental hit under the title \\"The Poor People of Paris\\".  Of course, Ms. Mathieu sings the three additional songs wonderfully.e three additional songs wonderfully.
B00012FXAE|5.0|The Bottom Line:    One of the fastest-moving long movies (over 150 minutes if you watch the director's cut, which you should) ever made, Aliens takes time to develop interesting and believable characters and then runs them through a gauntlet of intense sci-fi action, with special effects that still convince today and a Vietnam allegory for those who wish to look; you can hardly do better if you like this type of movie.
B000095K7A|5.0|I purchased this 2 disc lp record album a few weeks ago...And all I can say is WOW. This is now my favorite LP in my collection. Every track is perfect and fun to listen to. Ben Gibbard's vocals are outstanding as always. The packaging is superb, and the bonus poster and lyric book both featuring equally superb artwork made my purchase definitely worthwhile. GET THIS ALBUM!
6304698798|5.0|The Bottom Line:    It's not about any \\"theme,\\" has no deep message, and contains a lot of carnage, but The Good the Bad and the Ugly is in its own way a great movie; always interesting and always moving, the film is carried by its lead actors (especially a scene-stealing Eli Wallach), inspired direction and one helluva score by Ennio Morricone.
B001ADHCV6|3.0|The Long Run was my first rock album way back in 1980.  Beginning there, I collected the band's back catalogue and then followed the solo careers of Henley and (to a lesser extent) Frey.  But time marches on and tastes change, and I hadn't kept up with all of their post-band, band projects (live albums, box sets, etc.)  But when this new album was released, my brother gave a copy to me, and I gave it a few listens.  There are some good tunes, to be sure.  However, since the Eagles were guaranteed to sell millions of albums even if they had released a turd, they decided to manage the whole project themselves and ended up with an album that collapses under its own weight.  I believe the album would have been better if they'd tightened it up and released only one CD full of their best efforts instead of 2 CDs full of every musical idea they've had over the past 25 years.  The result is a mixed bag of tunes - some sound like the Eagles - some sound like a crappy Glen Frey solo album - some are long-winded, self-righteous Don Henley sneers.  SO - what the boys didn't do for themselves, I did for them: edited the album down to one hour's worth of music that fits on to one CD.    My guidelines in choosing and arranging the tracks:   * The CD had to be conceived as an album with side A and side B, each side having its own little journey, and the album making sense as a whole.  *Each tune had to mostly sound like an Eagles song, and not something that came from a solo record (this was not completely possible).  *The progression of songs had to have some sense of flow in terms of tempo and tonal/key relationship.  *All four singers had to be featured at least once - with the majority of the songs being equally divided between Henley and Frey.    I didn't like every tune that I selected for the album, and I didn't select every song I like.  But I do think that it now sounds like an Eagles album.    Here's the list, with commentary.  What do you think?    ALBUM SIDE A  1. How Long: forget that opening \\"Seven Bridges Road\\" redux crap (No More Walks in the Woods).  \\"How Long\\" is a good song from the Eagles' early career that kicks off my version of the album in a country-rocking way - sort of like the way Already Gone kicked off On the Border.    2. Fast Company: I just liked the way it sounded after How Long.  I wanted a One-Two punch.  And Henley's falsetto vocals reminded me a bit of Witchy Woman - track two on their debut album    3. I Don't Want to Hear Anymore: Not a bit Schmidt fan, but this may be the best \\"Eagles\\" sounding song on the album - very reminiscent of The Long Run in the guitar sound and vocals.  Slows the tempo down a bit after the opening two tracks.    4. I Love to Watch A Woman Dance: Slowing down even more here with Frey's ballad.  The mandolin and backing vocals recall Whatever Happened to Saturday Night.    5. Last Good Time in Town: The Latin-esque percussion at the beginning of this track gives that \\"Woman\\" something to dance to.  Also, time to pick up the tempo and have a good Joe guitar solo before we all start crying in our beer.    6. You Are Not Alone: Close out Side A of the album with Frey's short tune - reminding Joe that he's not alone even if he does choose to stay at home by himself.    ALBUM SIDE B  7. Long Road Out of Eden: a little self-important for my tastes, but since it was the title track, it was difficult to exclude.  Plus, the album needed all the rock songs I could find.  AND the vocal harmonies and guitar solos make this an Eagles-sounding song.    8. Somebody's Following You: I thought this sounded much better immediately following \\"Long Road\\" without that smarmy, Frey-solo-record-synth instrumental in between.  Not a great song, but Frey needed to sing rock and roll at least ONCE on this album.  Another 1-2 rock punch to start the album side.    9. The Center of the Universe: Beautiful song - another good one on this album.    10. Do Something: This song is very formulaic and not very good, in my opinion.  (I can hear The Dude saying, \\"I HATE the effing Eagles!\\")  However, the bridge is fantastic and is worth the rest of the smarm.    11. Waiting in the Weeds: Another really, really good song.  Didn't want to include another 7 minute tune, but couldn't leave this out.  Great use of mandolin.  I would have followed #9 with this and skipped Do Something - but Henley needed a break, and did I mention the bridge of Do Something?    12. It's Your World Now: I like both the sentiment and the arrangement of this Southern-California-Mariachi-Band tune.  The Eagles liked it to close out the album, and so do I.  A nice, hopeful counter-balance to \\"The Sad Cafe'\\" that closes their last \\"real\\" studio album, The Long Run.    Seriously, I hope that the Eagles made all of the money that they needed to retire on this album.  It is NOT their world anymore.  Leave the new music making to folks like Wilco, Ryan Adams, Lucinda Williams, and so forth.    Rock on!
B000UAE7RW|5.0|The Bottom Line:    Watch Jack Nicholson act as well as he ever did, watch Roman Polanski channel his wife's tragic death and a script by Robert Towne into a piece of cinematic art, watch one of the few color noirs worthy of the name: above all else, watch Chinatown.
B000001Y79|5.0|Man, I sure wish Gwen Stefani was still making music like this!  I remember purchasing this album back when it was new after hearing \\"Spiderwebs\\" and \\"Don't Speak\\" on the radio.  The album remained in constant rotation on my CD player for many years thereafter and I count it as one of those \\"special\\" albums where everything about it seems to work it its favor.  Gwen sounds fabulous and her vocal range is well displayed, the band is tight, the song lyrics are quirky and unique while also being intelligent and thought-provoking, the album doesn't sound overproduced, and it has a high re-listenability factor (read: you want to listen to it over and over again).  Simply put, \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" is a modern classic that still sounds fresh today and remains a document of a time when all of the elements came together for No Doubt.  It has a very positive, energetic vibe, helped in large part by Gwen Stefani's gutsy, theatrical vocal delivery.  She was the alterna-chick that every high school girl wanted to be, with the platinum hair, brightly colored midriff-revealing clothes, and signature red lipstick.  And I must admit that I cannot listen to this album without mourning, in a sense, the Gwen of yesteryear...  After \\"Return To Saturn\\" and \\"Rock Steady\\", the beginning of Gwen Stefani's solo career marked a change in her musical direction, and unfortunately not a good one.  While I was initially intrigued by the idea of a solo Gwen, both of her solo albums so far seem to have proven how self-indulgent music can sometimes be and the pitfalls that can sometimes happen when one member of a band strikes out on his/her own.  Silly songs with juvenile, pretentious lyrics, some of which are just plain dreadful, and a strange obsession with how much she likes her clothing line L.A.M.B. (which, sadly, was not only the inspiration for the title of her debut solo album, Love.Angel.Music.Baby, but was also featured in at least two songs, one of them on her second album).  When untemperedby her bandmates, a little bit of Gwen goes a long way.  She used to make music that mattered and now she just makes fluff.  I liked the old Gwen, before she had a clothing line and before she let her fame go to her head.  But all is not lost.  We still have \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" to remember her by.  Gwen, come back to us!  It's time to take the pink ribbon off for real now.
6304907648|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Copycat earned some plaudits upon its release, but its a basically straightforward thriller that sits much more comfortably next to Kiss the Girls than Silence of the Lambs; by way of example, within 20 minutes any attentive viewer should be able to guess which extraneous character is doomed by the law of character economy.
0802798225|5.0|Alex is a gang member from the wrong side of town. Brittany is the beautiful and popular girl from the right side of town. Brittany and Alex are so different that when they get sat next to each other in chemistry they hate each other but that quickly changes as they discover they have more in common than first thought. this fantastic book is told threw the alternating views of Alex and Brittany. i loved this book and reccomend it to everyone who loves a god YA romance.
B000S0GYRU|2.0|The Bottom Line:    Argento's skill lies in visuals, not storytelling, and that's never been more apparent than in Suspiria: the film's characters all talk like 8 year-olds (Argento wrote the script for younger characters and never changed it) and there's no real mystery whatsoever.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This is an excellent history piece, well written, acted, and directed.  Definitely NOT a chick flick.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|The Bottom Line:    A worthy successor to Chinatown and the movie that should have won Best Picture in 1998, L.A. Confidential is an elegantly directed and expertly acted movie (before Kevin Spacey blew up and Russell Crowe became Russell Crowe) that rewards those who watch it more than once, but please just make sure you watch it at all.
B0010ZR160|4.0|In adapting Boston resident Dennis Lehane's crime novel Gone Baby Gone to the screen, the co-writer/director Ben Affleck chose what could be called a flat style, referring to a rock solid focus on what people really say, the words they really use in the wide range of emotional scenarios they're faced with. It's the antithesis of stylized; it's the first thing you think of when somebody says something to you that you like or you don't like; it's your first gut reaction to whatever was said.<br /><br />This tends to draw the viewer into the film in a kind of inevitable way; you can't help wanting to listen to what's going on. The most flamboyant character is Remy Bressant, a cop played by Ed Harris; in a way, he provides the \\"style\\" element that's otherwise counterbalanced by the straight-ahead performances of Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan, the two young private investigators hired to find a missing little girl. Also counterbalancing Remy's more dramatic presence is Morgan Freeman, a quiet police captain who plays a critical role in the film.<br /><br />The four stars are for a thoughtful, well-crafted film that's not afraid to make substantial use of locals in the Dorchester section of Boston to tell this story of innocence and corruption. It's an involving film that pulls you into it in spite of its 'flatness', in spite of its clearly non-stylized approach. The exact opposite of Affleck's Superman movie, Hollywoodland--full of Tinseltown style--Gone Baby Gone is a strong piece of work that should win at least some awards.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
078322737X|4.0|The Bottom Line:    An engaging-enough nostalgia piece, American Graffiti has an entirely undeserved reputation as a classic but it's sweet and enjoyable enough to be worth recommending even if it feels somewhat slow due to its unplotted, episodic nature.
B000002P72|5.0|I agree with everything in the other positive reviews about what a great album this is, but would like to add something for anyone wanting to learn blues guitar.    This CD is a goldmine of great riffs and a great way to learn blues phrasing from a master.  A few of the riffs are well worn cliche's at this point, but many are surprising and BB's not afraid to go out of the standard pentatonic box at times.  The phrasing and dynamics are sweeter than sweet.  You could not do ANY better in my opinion than to start with, or add to your repetoire from, this album!!!!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Unfortunately not the last stand for this series, Xmen III suffers from too many characters and the fact that the screenwriters don't know what to do with them--the reasonable heights reached in the previous 2 movies aren't approached and the viewer is left disappointed.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|Best movie EVER. EVER. EVER. No need to write a review here because I'm sure the person reading this agrees also.
B00000K31Q|3.0|The Bottom Line:    Another forgettable teen romance/comedy that moves swiftly along its formulaic, pre-ordained path, 10 Things I Hate About You tries for Shakespeare connections but belongs next to She's All That, not The Taming of the Shrew.
B0015519VS|3.0|I have been a fan for years, but this one disappointed me a little... There were two songs from the album - \\"Moving Mountains\\" and \\"His Mistakes\\" that I heard before and loved, and they were the reason I bought the album in the first place. It turned out, however, that apart from those two, there is little else that grabbed my attention - hence the three stars.. He's a bit out of his element - unusual for him, but Usher has definitely grown. I'm curious to see what he comes up with next! I'm still a fan anyway! :)
B000OCXMAE|3.0|I was never a Linkin Park fan. Back when they released Hybrid Theory the only songs I liked from the band was \\"Papercut\\". The other songs like \\"Crawling\\" and \\"Points of Authority\\" didn't sound too great to me. When Meteora was released, all of the songs except \\"Numb\\" grew on me. \\"Faint\\" especially became one of my favorites from LP. Now, we have Minutes to Midnight. And as you can see, this band has changed. Gone are the infusions of Techno and Hip-Hop; Rock is the only thing going here, which is a shame because that's what made this band so unique. Another reason why this album is so controversial, because it's softer and much less melodic (and lyrics less significant) than the other two albums. Sure, my favorite songs here are \\"Bleed it Out\\" and \\"What I've Done\\", but the others don't live up to \\"Faint\\" and \\"Papercut\\".<br /><br />Personally, I'm more for Metal and Grunge (Nirvana and Korn are just two of my favorites), but Linkin Park doesn't seem to be too bad. This album, however, will be a problem to ever LP fan that expects hard rock/electronica/hip hop all the way through.<br /><br />Grade: C+
1582701709|1.0|The book has one good idea---that you should keep a positive outlook on life. However it attempts to extract the most money from this one idea by expanding 200 pages out of it. The worst part is the 200 pages are actually more like 20 pages stretched over giant margins and big, pointless clip art pictures. I won't even mention the countless other crimes against humanity it commits; just read the other candid reviews.<br /><br />Save yourself the $20 and don't get ripped off by Rhonda. Do not buy this worthless piece of @#$%!
B001FBIPF0|5.0|This release has taken me by suprise. By all accounts I should be not digging this. But I do, alot. The melodies are here in abundance and almost every song on here has a over the top(in a good way) chorus that blows you away. YOu cant deny the hooks on this record. Its not punk..Its pop but there is nothing wrong with that.
031606792X|5.0|I loved this series - became very attached to the characters and I would highly recommend.  I'm 42 and I enjoyed reading from the perspective of Bella, a high-schooler.  I tried reading Anne Rice many years ago and just couldn't get into her books - these books were easy to get into and hard to put down.
B0009NCQJ6|2.0|I absolutely love this band, but I really think it is lame that they allowed a CD to be created titled \\"Best Of ....\\"!  That shows how greedy they or their marketers are to sell CDs.  The band should seek to tour more often if they want to get their name out.  I just get irked that they chose to make this mistake.  The music on this CD it top notch, but they don't deserve to have a \\"Best Of\\" title anytime soon, and neither does Britney Spears!<br /><br />Buy the CD if you don't have any of their music.  Don't buy the CD if you do.  Its that simple in my opinion.

B001GAOY5U|2.0|Seeing this movie in the theater in 3D was quite enjoyable.  Obviously being in 3D, there were a number of gratuitous 3D effects which looked ok but not necessary, but hey, might as well get all the effects you can into the movie.  All in all, a fairly enjoyable movie.    But I expected much more in BlueRay.  The 3D effect was there, but uneventful. The color was way off.  I made the recommended adjustments that came with the disc.  Nada.  Tweaked the reds, tweaked the greens.  It went from poor color to no color.  Restored to defaults and it really was annoying to watch.  The regular (2D) version was ok.  But still, it looked like standard fare than it did a blueray.  After all the tweaking and adjustments, and then settling for less than a blue ray experience, I don't even recall what kind of features were there on the film.   I'm thinking that any 3D movie will be poor in the home until they provide us with better viewers, (like they provided in the movies for 3D, which by the way, does not work when watching LCD's), or building 3D compatible LCD's/Plasmas.  Until then, stick with regular discs and not 3D.
B0019HQIGS|1.0|This guy CAN NOT be compared to Stevie Ray Vaughan... Though he thinks he can.     I mean, he's got a good technique, but seems more interested in his cars and watches.... He even has a kind of a butler to lay out the watches for him...     And the acoustic set is SO obvious...     Disappointing.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I don't really like musicals, but this one is a must have with most of The Beatles hits and and excellent director, producer and cast.    Product was in its original case and it's like new!
B001C3KCSY|4.0|I enjoyed the Kings of Leon's last album but was not impressed enough to run out and buy Only By the Night.  Than I heard Sex on Fire and without knowing who it was buy decided I had to have the ablum.  I am so glad that I got the albm. This album rocks and really throws the guitars at you much like the Black Crowes used to.  The big radio friendly song is Crawl.  Only by the Night in my opinion much stronger than their previous cd.  If good old fashion rock n roll is your thing than you will really enjoy this Kings Of Leon cd!!!
0312427999|1.0|I thought she is a clever girl, I thought the author knows a thing or two, but this book proves that everything she does comes from a far left thinking.  The book, like her political views, come with an agenda and leaves no place for impartial and neutral thinking. Very disappointing.
B0015OKWL2|5.0|Some reviewers have noted that Deniro and Pacino \\"sleep walk\\" through this movie. I disagree. They're 30 year on the force veteran cops, who as they say themselves are \\"numb\\" to the violence and the system. They don't get frantic and out of control, because to them, it's all business as usual - taking out the trash. The plot is solid, if not spectacular and the acting exactly what I would expect from the stars. I'm not sure if I'd call it a twist ending, as there are several \\"clues\\" or tip offs through out the film that might lead you to figure it out before hand. However, in a year (2008) or largly disappointing movies, this one is certainly well above the crowd and in my estimation one of the best.
B00005221M|5.0|Based on the novel by James Fenimore Cooper, \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" takes place during the French and Indian War. There are several battle scenes and a suspenseful chase scene at the end, as well as accurate depictions of colonial life with historical detail, but the most important element of the story is the romance between Hawkeye, played by Daniel Day-Lewis, and Cora, played by Madeleine Stowe. This is by far Lewis's best film yet. He plays Hawkeye with fierce intensity, and the chemistry between the two lovers is so subtly displayed it's all the more powerful.<br /><br />The movie was filmed in North Carolina, near my grandmother's house, and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous. Wes Studi is exceptional as Magua, a Huron who lost his family at the hands of the British commander and whose vengeful goal is to take his family from him. The sound track excels - its cadence carries the viewer along, building anticipation and suspense until the very end.<br /><br />The VHS version is much better than the DVD, in my opinion. In any event, this is one of my favorite movies and I would recommend it to all.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Great writing, top-drawer acting, dazzling production, all coupled with high morals and concern for one's fellow human.  What more can one reasonably ask from a TV show?  Davies and his crew have preserved the best of the 'old' Doctor Who whilst raising the bar for every other fiction show currently on television...and we are the beneficiaries.  There is no bad here.  Good parents will sit their children down to watch these episodes, then watch them again after the kids go to bed.  It's that good.

0375836675|5.0|After having read The Book Thief, I was so taken with his literary style that I decided to read I Am the Messenger. Although I could have read it in one night, I really wanted to savor the poetic way of his descriptions (\\"...the sentence fell between us like a ball with no air...\\") and the smiles he continuously coaxed from me. I shall continue to be his faithful reader.

0525951113|5.0|I picked this up last week looking for some light entertainment out of my normal genre of fantasy and was very surprised by just how much I liked it. The book is entertaining, fast paced; believable enough to where it almost makes me unplug my Internet connection.  This book is an excellent start to a writing career that I look forward to following. I will be marking the sequel down as a must have.  This is a techno thriller portraying a type of Internet doomsday.  Although there are a lot of hi-tech things portrayed within the book it does not require you to be an IT expert to understand. The author has done a great job and this book should appeal to the technology expert and us everyday readers as well.

159102594X|5.0|When I first picked it up and began reading, I almost set this book aside thinking it was just another comic book type tale and I am grateful that I had nothing else to read at the time and therefore continued.   This epic fantasy tale has great characterizations. The book follows three main characters, the angry bitter Inquisitor Glotka, the northern Barbarian, Logan Ninefingers and the selfish Nobleman, Luthar.    The book reminds me somewhat of Martin in that the characters are not portrayed as heroes, but are flawed human beings, each carrying their own unique issues. By the end of the book it was difficult to say which if any were the \\"good\\" guys and yet I found myself engrossed in each of them, wanting to know which direction they would go and what would happen to them.    I enjoyed this book so much that I ordered the next one from England and paid extra for shipping rather than have to wait for its publication here. I did the same with the third and final book of the series. All were equally enjoyable. I look forward to reading more of Abercrombie in the future
630471193X|5.0|I watched this again for about the fourth time and it always gets me.  The plot requires some forceful suspension of disbelief, but the characters, the acting, and the emotional territory explored by the film are believable and affecting.  I love the gentleness, humor and forgiveness of human foibles; at times it almost feels informed by the work of Steinbeck.  The love story is sweet, but the friendships John Travolta has with Robert Duvall and Forest Whitaker are perfect.  Viewing is enhanced by lovely sets, scenery and cinematography and a pleasant soundtrack.  Corny for sure, but in this case I don't mind a bit.
B00003CX5P|3.0|Good overall, some parts should have been shortened up.  I know they are telling the story, but some of it just drags on.  Some parts are just annoying, like Jar-jar and the announcers of the pod race.<br />Since I am a fan of the series, I got this for the collection.
B001O22ELQ|5.0|The fact that the entire movie takes place in a (not so completely absurd) fantasy world makes it that much better...... seriously I laughed the entire way though this mini-movie. Well worth the small amount of money!
B00000AA6C|5.0|I enjoyed watching 'Sound of Music' when I was a little girl. Now my children loves it, too. Great for a family movie night.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I went to see the movie and was blown away by Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan.<br /><br />I've seen it 16 times at the cinema and now it's the DVD that doesn't stop at my home. I just looooooooooove it!<br /><br />A word to Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Julie Walters and Christine Baranski they were excelent in the movie.<br /><br />They are no professional singers but they really surprised me because they CAN sing! Specially Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan.<br /><br />So I just can say, and using a word from another great movie, Mamma Mia is: Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
1592533868|5.0|Wow, this is a thorough and lovely book.  Though not unlike others of the genre, The Art of Paper Quilling includes a goodly amount of information on the topic including: history of the art, discussion of paper types, list of equipment and its purpose, important supplies, and additional non-quilling techniques.  She does not cover preservative methods other than that designs may be mounted and framed, nor does she--or anyone else--suggest any clever methods of getting a quilled gift card safely through the postal system.<br /><br />The author provides, not only photographed collections of shapes but, a detailed written description of the techniques required to render them.  Her designs show a pronounced sense of color and texture, and while she presents some designs specific to special occasions, the overall collection is definitely directed to a general audience and a multiplicity of purposes.<br /><br />Most of the quilling techniques are illustrated in one or more of the author's projects, which allows the student to practice them, and there are projects at all levels of experience, so that the more advanced student will also find a challenge.  Patterns and templates are found at the back of the book for the student's use, and they include patterns for a sachet package and for boxes of heart, oval and square shapes.<br /><br />Although there were some designs I felt were a little awkward (place cards on p. 107 and 109) or lacked something (as the greeting card on p. 58), I found most of her work stunning.  I was particularly impressed with the display of butterflies introducing the gallery photos, and may try some of them myself.  I really, really loved the boxes--I'm crazy about boxes anyway--and will definitely try some of them.  In thinking in terms of alternative uses, I ntoed that many of the designs would make gorgeous cake decorations, something that might be kept as a memento of a special occasion.<br /><br />I really loved this book.

0316036692|5.0|Life is not fair. This small, fascinating book proves that it is not really a pick-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps world. There are unnoticed biases and predetermined traps for the innocent everywhere. The successful have \\"hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies\\" that are doled out unfairly.<br /><br />Most of us know this. But Outliers shows us the patterns to this phenomenon, the data behind the unfairness. And author Malcolm Gladwell uses compelling stories to make his case.<br /><br />The prevailing wisdom on success holds that it is an individual activity available to everyone. Someone that excels either works harder or smarter or was born with more natural talent. The secret can't be something as innocuous as your birthday. But for Canadian hockey players, it is. Boys with birthdays closest to the January 1 cutoff date for picking teams are overwhelmingly chosen as the \\"best players,\\" and given tremendous opportunities. This makes them truly better, not just older and more mature than their December-born playmates.<br /><br />In one engrossing story after another, Outliers proves with simple, elegant logic that success occurring through individual merit is a myth. It actually depends on more than the individual. You have to look at the bigger picture, at the forest instead of the trees.<br /><br />It was fun reading about Jeb Bush insisting that he is a self-made man, that he got ahead by his own individual pluck and determination. This from a man born to a United States president, brother to another, and grandson to a senator and wealthy Wall Street banker. Gladstone points out that this is \\"thinking that cannot be described as anything other than delusional.\\"<br /><br />I couldn't put Outliers down. It's riveting.<br /><br />Here's the chapter list:<br /><br />Introduction: The Roseta Mystery<br /><br />Part One: Opportunity<br />1. The Matthew Effect<br />2. The 10,000-Hour Rule<br />3.

B00009Z576|4.0|Drama is an anomaly of sorts, and the only Yes album not to feature vocalist Jon Anderson. For this reason some Yes fans are quick to dismiss the album outright. Indeed, the departure of Anderson and keyboardist Rick Wakeman in early 1980 left the remaining band members in a quandary, and the solution to their problem led to one of the more unlikely \\"mergers\\" in rock history. Replacing the departed members were vocalist Trevor Horn and keyboardist Geoff Downes, who as a duo called The Buggles had enjoyed a huge hit with \\"Video Killed the Radio Star\\" (later the first video ever aired on MTV). Unlikely as that merger may seem, the new members provided a shot in the arm that Yes sorely needed, and the results on Drama are actually quite impressive. Rather than being a radical departure from the earlier Yes, the album takes the best qualities of that earlier prog-rock version of the band (while doing away with some of its more self-indulgent aspects) and infuses them with a brighter, fresher sound, no doubt brought to the mix by Downes' and Horn's more pop-oriented sensibilities. Although the merger itself was short-lived, and Anderson later rejoined the fold, Drama marks an important turning point in the history of Yes. Rather than an aberration, the album should be seen as a vital link between the old Yes and the new, as it paved the way for the band's triumphant 1984 return with the album 90125.
1401219268|5.0|Since the beginning of comic books, their authors have destined superheroes to fight malevolence, almost without hesitation. Comic books and graphic novels, until The Watchmen, rarely ever stray from this eternal struggle between good and evil. Set in 1980s New York City, The Watchmen brings a new perspective into the psychology of the superhero. The novel tells the tale about a group of vigilantes, who are desperately needed, as they mature from average human beings into people with elevated senses of themselves. The novel grapples with good and evil unlike any prior graphic novel. The band of \\"superheroes\\" begins to hesitate as the world implodes around them. The fantastic book even intrudes into our own reality.<br /><br />During the height of the Cold War and the brink of nuclear war, the now defunct band of vigilantes is faced with an imminent apocalyptic threat. Though, this group, which had rescued its corrupt world many times before, feels obliged to rescue it again, the members have matured. They begin to question the necessity of their help and doubt their abilities to achieve any fundamental change in society. We soon realize that the characters are merely human as they question their purpose and being. The story crescendo's with a debate between two of the Watchmen about whether humanity should consume itself or should the group intervene and possibly prevent this catastrophe.<br /><br />This story provides a uniquely, insightful window about what human beings would do with unnatural power. It even questions humanity's dependence, or faith, on forces that are invisible and larger them themselves.
037582913X|5.0|I loved this book as a child, and I just purchased it my daughter. I can't wait to storytime this book is so funny.
B001MNFOIW|3.0|I'm all for all out action movies, and this movie wasn't bad. I wasn't expecting any award winning performances. Action was good. There was a good twist, but I will say I thought the very end was dumb. Like the very last line of the movie.     Morgan Freeman cursing loudly was hilarious and worth watching also.    I would say this is a rent, not a buy.
B00000I8NC|4.0|Musically this is an awesome album... it is not the greatist music in the world but it's one of my favorite Godspeed Albums.    Just got to reiterate one complaint of the other views.  BBF3 is an awesome but the ranting man on the street really hurts the whole song.  When he is complaining about paying his speeding ticket and talks about his horrable experience which was him basically screaming at the judge and having a total lack of respect for his fellow man, it just makes him look like an arrogant prick.  And how the music picks up as to support his claim is just really melodramatic for no reason and it is to say autority is wrong just because it is authority and not because it has actually wronged someone.  Later on in the song, the same man confirms how arrogant he when he is asked \\"how will things look in 2000\\" and he says something along the lines of \\"I don't even have a mind that smart\\"... he just comes out as a real douche with no humility and no respect for anyone except himself.    Other then that, this is a really great album and I would still recommend it.
031606792X|4.0|Breaking Dawn is a smart end to a great series (although I would like to see more books about these characters!).  This novel is more graphic than the first three, but speaking as a squeamish person I didn't have any problem reading the whole book.  I know some people didn't love the way things happened or were presented, but I think it ALL is perfect.  Not too racy, plenty of affection and a great ending (or rather a great begining for a new life ;-)  If you have come this far you must read Breaking Dawn, I do not think you will be disappointed that you did.
B000YXMMAE|5.0|I have a friend who hates this album.  Her favorite band?  Fall Out Boy.  Enough said.  So, for all of you Fall Out Boy fans, you will want to avoid this one like the plague.     However, for anyone who enjoys actual music, Radiohead knocked this one out of the park.  I downloaded this when it was first released and haven't stopped listening to it.  It is their best album since OK Computer, and I believe it may just be better. Highlights for me are Nude, Weird Fishes, All I Need, Reckoner, House of Cards, and Jigsaw Falling Into Place.  Reckoner is just plain brilliant.  When the keyboards come in on top of the percussion, it is a fantastic moment.  My recommendation is to buy it and listen to it repeatedly.  It is definitely an album that grows on you and rewards continued listening.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Until I heard Scenes from a Memory, I was a tepid DT fan at best. After being (and continuing to be) thoroughly impressed with that album, I was excited to hear the next one - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. This album has managed to grab both my feet and pull me completely into the DT admiration society!    This album has two true parts to it. However, the two parts are still thematically connected in their focus on our struggles with understanding our own spirituality.    The first disc has some great individual songs that, on average, dance around the notion of how our spirituality plays into our lives. Glass Prison is a strong opener written around the first two steps of the AA 12 step plan. The AA suite is building into a very impressive set of songs strung out between several albums that have since followed this one (TOT, Octavarium, & Systamic Chaos so far). Perhaps, once Mike Portnoy has finished this suite, they will re-issue it together on its own?...One can only hope!    Blind Faith is a powerful song (both musically and lyrically) around struggles with the need for and notion of faith in each person. From an arrangement standpoint, I believe this is the best of the first disk.    Following that song is Misunderstood. This is probably my least favorite song on either disk. It is still a good DT piece and has a very good verse and chorus arrangement. However, this song lingers on for 2-3 minutes after the final chorus while not really going anywhere. I normally skip the ending instrumentals on this piece.     Perhaps the most interesting song (overall) on this disk is the Great Debate. You will never hear a politically motivated song do a better job at delivering a better balance of both sides of an arguement that this one does. While they are not unbiased in their opinion regarding stem cell research, they actually strive (successfully) to level both sides of the argument lyrically and musically. It is very enjoyable in that respect. They really do leaveit to the listener to think through.    The final song on disk 1 is Disappear. It is a lament about the passing of a dear friend/spouse during the final hours. It is a quiet song that slowly drags itself deeper and deeper into you on each listening until you are stuggling right along with the band. This one most certainly grows on you.    Coming to the second disk, at this point, initially, I was almost to the point of wondering if I would be overwhelmed by it all. The opening piece, the overture, actually draws you back in somewhat gently (at least for DT) before the rest of the disk hits you over the head with some serious rock and serious material. The disc spends a substantial amount of time and effort trying to describe several different types of mental illness from the inside. In the end, you feel like you might actually have a little better understanding of what goes on in the mind of those who suffer from some of the illnesses detailed here than you had before. If you are a fan of Pink Floyd's The Wall, you will appreciate this approach to the topic all-the-more.     This whole disc is an enjoyable journey through a topic that is anything but. I still spend time listening to this trying to better understand how they pull this off.    Musically, there is a substantial amount of detail on both discs that can easily be missed. From a technique standpoint, there is not alot new here. Of course, with DT, that means very little since they have tabled so much new already. However, this is not a rehash of past music or even past styles. This is new for them on many levels.     This disk demands to be played a) loud, b)on good equipment, and c) all the way through in one sitting (at least the second disc). Even then, much like in Scenes, you will be discovering new details you sware weren't there during the previous pass.    As a direct result of Scenes and this album, I now consider myself a serious DT fan. This is one of the best albums I own in my entire collection. I have played it enough now that I would normally be getting at least a little tired of it and have to park it for a time. However, the opposite has happened; it is like opening the book up for the first time - again and again.     This is a full emersion CD. You will not be able to help yourself after one or two passes. If you insist that 4 minute thrash songs which require little or no thought are as good as it gets, then this is probably not for you. Otherwise, this is a must have for your music collection, one which will spend far more time being played than filling up storage space!    DT is considered a \\"prog metal\\" band and most certainly are. However, this album proves, yet again, that they are far more than that. They are \\"progressive\\", period.
0061245097|5.0|I just had to log in and rate this book, which is something I have never done, I just felt that strongly about it. The book was great, the writing was catchy and crisp, I was hooked within 10 pages. I loved Cat and Bones, *really* loved Bones. I felt the emotion with the characters, the story was fast paced and never left me wishing it would get to the point. I cannot wait for the 4th installment to come out. This book ranks right up there with BDB and IAD, great read!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter and she loves it even more than the David Archuleta cd.  I was really surprised!
B000002GBJ|4.0|As the title indicates this is one of the best of Wakeman's early compositional works.  On many of the tracks the themes are over played but all in all there is not a single track I have not continued to listen to over the years with enjoyment.  Second, as with many Wakeman pieces, I find myself drawn to the subject matter through his musical interpretation.  Thanks for Catherine of Aragon.  She was worth the album.  The rest are a bonus.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Loved this movie when I was little and love it today.  It brings back a lot of good memories.  I watch it every year on NBC and it still brings tears to my eyes.  Now I will watch it every year and I don't have to wait for any commercials.  An inspiring movie and one we should always keep in the back of our mind.
B000001FZK|5.0|It's a big statement I know, but Talk Talk's last three albums are landmarks in modern music. From their new romantic beginnings ( and they were very good at it ) this album see's a band charting their own course with no room for passengers.          Certain songs on \\" It's My Life \\" from 1984 pointed towards a change in direct ( especially with the track \\" Renee \\" ), but it wasn't until the 1986 album \\" The Colour of Spring \\" that we really saw the band spreading it's wings. Following with \\" Spirit of Eden \\" ( close to the greatest album of the 80's ), the band were really in full voice. The final album \\" Laughing Stock \\" leaves where Spirit left off, but the great thing about all three albums, is that there is still a faint thread of a pop song in them all. These albums need and deserve repeated listenings, as there is so much depth and colour to the music. There are few bands in the 80's that pushed the envelope as hard as this !          Mark Hollis sounds like a wounded man, Lee Harris's drumming is hypnotic and Paul Webb's melodic textural bass playing was exactly that......a web that spins and spirals around you. Webb had departed after Spirit of Eden, and was admirally replaced by the amazing Danny Thompson. I implore you to discover this album, and go back to the previous two....you won't be disappointed !

B000002GBK|3.0|Wakeman is one of my favorite performers and this album shows why.  He succeeds or fails dramatically.  The story is well concieved but inconsistently presented.  Vocals are often over dramatized and recall a poor light opera.  This is consistent with many other choral forays scored by Wakeman.  His playing is flawless but not as inspired as other formats.  Keep at it Rick.  You're the best but you have done better and will do better again.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I'm surprised that more of the songs from this album didn't get air play ... really it's just such a fantastic mix of upbeat instrumentals infused with a good mix of harmonic vocals that I've played the album for people before and had them say \\"What band IS that?\\" -- amazed that something so juicy had slipped by.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Great Buy!<br /><br />Bourne kicks Bond Butt..!! This a good value dvd pack, with 3 excellent films written as a trilogy. The filming is top notch and adds to the sense of realism. Matt Damon does most of his own stunts and fighting scenes which makes it all actually really believable - there are practically no outrageous \\"Bond\\" moments which are simply not possible in the real world...<br /><br />The 2nd film isn't quite as intense but the 3rd is a non-stop thrill ride. Look out for the part of the film in Morocco for some serious heart pounding action...... It's not necessarily about the action but the stress of him being caught that makes this a fantastic film which is so rare for the 3rd in a series.<br /><br />The Blu Ray version recently released which would be an obvious buy if money is not an issue but this version has loads of extras to keep you happy and you'll be drawn to watch if over a few times to catch all the little subtle plot lines.. Awesome!
0099429799|4.0|There were many of the usual reasons why Atonement was worthwhile--imaginative plot, painfully-well-described settings, true-to-life motives, lyrical prose, etc.--but what distinguished the book the most for me among the many other fine 1950-present novels I've read was the convincing portrayal of how kids think, and also how major twists and turns in life can result from a single event.<br /><br />I think we've all asked ourselves at some point, \\"I wonder what would've happened if I hadn't done X, or did meet Y, or didn't go to Z at this time--how would my life have been different?\\" Atonement was a fascinating exploration of such a question. Put another way, I think we've all heard about or read about some case in the news where children are involved, and we wonder \\"Wait, how could all of that happen?\\" I found myself nodding in agreement at how convincingly McEwan answered that kind of question--in a sense, the fiction that's more true than life.
B000GW8RVQ|3.0|Amazing how the biggest selling points for longtime fans and collectors either doesn't make it past the line-up card exchange or they wind up as unsatisfying h'ors d'ouvres: case in point...the Review title.<br />Overall a very strong DVD, with JB in high spirits and high energy. Best part: JB jumps into the audience on \\"Please, Please, Please\\".<br />Definitely one of the better James Brown concert DVDs, though it has the same issues of A & R sameness and not much artist-audience interaction. Compare this DVD (and many others) with most of his live CDs and you'll too remark that JB without that element is not the real deal.

Now it is no secret that Christopher Nolan's addaptation to the batman comic book mithology is a masterpiece, but lets see how the dvd and blu ray affair at bringing the film to the small screen.    Movie Rating: 10/10 (all rating will be out of ten).    Packaging: The packaging for both the dvd and blu ray are practicly the same. You get your normal Dark Knight slip case with Batman on his Bat Bod while the actual case has the joker on the front and a Jokerised version of the text on the back. Inside the two discs look the same though the blu ray has a third disc which is a digital copy. The only way that the dvd case would be better is becasue it has more pictures from the film, but it really doesn't matter. Packiging score: 10 on blu ray and dvd.    Picure/transfer: The Transfer is amazing on Blu Ray. It has great image in colors, framerate, and black images. The real hd however comes from the select sequences shot in imax that have their apperance during the movie on the blu ray while the dvd has it on the 2nd disc. The imax scenes have some of the best hd in a blu ray disc ever. It is incredible!!!! However the dvd version is dissapointingly flawed with some bad color image at points and sometimes poor framerate. The imax scenes are also only featured on the second disc and not during the movie. It doesn't even look much better though, so the blu ray will win this round. Picture/transfer rating: blu ray: 10. DVD: 7    Sound: The sound however is approprietly room shaking for both versions. The suround sound really has a great balance and will summon the cops to your door for a small gang war happening in your living room. Both versions have great surround sound, however the blu ray is slightly better because it has an hd mix witch mixes it a little morethan the dvd, but they still both have great sound. So turn up the volume and wake the neighboors. Sound Rating: Blu Ray: 10. DVD: 9.    Extras: The bonus features on the blu ray are not the best, but are still better than the dvd version. The first disc has movie focus points which have Gotham uncovered scenes. these are how the scenes are made like the imax chases, the first scene, the explosions, the batpod, bat suit, and more. These are very nice for a look at how your favorite scenes came to life. These are also on the dvd, but not all of them are on there, and are only on the second disc instead of watching them during your favorite parts of the film. The rest of the features on the blu ray have two documentrys from batmans gear and a psychology route on batmans inner struggle. These aren't in the dvd which is a dissapointment. I also wish that for both versions that they showed behind the scenes fottage at the making with heath ledger. That would be awesome. In addition, there is some nice BD Live content with downloads and documentrys you can make which are great. The features also have four galleries on blu ray, and two on dvd. There are also the theatrical trailers for the dvd and blu ray, and on the blu ray there are some tv spots. The features do not have heath ledger which is dissapointing,and the dvd features do not even have half of what blu ray has, but the features are still great on both, thought the dvd could have done a lot better. Each also has a digital copy to put on your ipod or computer too which is nice, so that sort of makes up for it. Extras rating: Blu Ray: 9. DVD: 7    Overall, The Dark Knight is good enough to buy on either version, but the Blu Ray still stands in front for its quality, bd live, and features. still both are worth buying and you will enjoy each version. Dark Knight fans should probaly smile to the dvd, but wil say \\"Why so serious? Because we seriously love this blu ray\\". So blu ray is better.    Overall Rating:  Blu Ray: 9.5  DVD: 8.5
0553384775|5.0|This book was great. It is an incredible story that draws you in and doesn't let go. I cannot wait until the next book comes out. I already pre-ordered it and if its half as good as this it will be worth every penny.
B001BKZDB4|5.0|My daughter and I really groove to this movie. She loves all the songs and I love trying to dance along with \\"I don't dance\\"..!!
074325144X|5.0|This book is great for those who want to run correctly. As a Chiropractor, this book helps you run in an injury free way.  For distance runners it is great, or for those who want to run for a long time at a slower pace.  Ultramarathoners would benefit from this book too.
B001F12J48|1.0|This 3D movie stinks.  When you put the glasses on, every thing looks double.    It is a great movie, but the 3D STINKS
B001NZC3R4|5.0|I've been waiting for the Allman Brothers to be offered here. In the 70's all of Long Island loved the Brothers! Southbound and Jessica are great tracks; Ramblin' Man shows a poppish side to them. I have this in LP, so to get the digital versions, at this price it's a no- brainer.
B001BWTVNS|5.0|If you've just heard of Led Zeppelin and you want to get an idea of what they are about, get this album. Some have said if they were deserted on a desert isle and could only have one album with them, this is the album they would choose. This album has it all. From my perspective, this album borders on \\"perfection\\" when it comes to hard rock. The mixing of the drums, guitar, vocals and John Pauls work on the keys and bass are near perfect. No other band in the history of rock has had this breadth of musical talent, and it is on full display here . This album opens wth the straight ahead, almost 1950's rocker, \\"Custard Pie\\". You get gentle rockers with songs like \\"Ten Years Gone\\" and \\"Night Flight\\". Folk with songs like \\"Bron-yr-aur\\", \\"Black Contry Woman\\" and the near comedic \\"Boogie with Stu\\". Straight up fist in the air rockers like the truly bombastic \\"The Wanton Song\\" and \\"Trampled Underfoot\\", and of course. the anthemic \\"Kashmir\\".    The sound quality on this CD is superb. You can hear the gentle bombast with which John Bonham played drums. Some said they way he played was like a \\"hippo in a tutu\\". Odd imagery, yet it works. The way the cymbal crashes fade in \\"The Wanton Song\\" are almost spine tingling.    Arguably, short \\"Stairway\\", this is Zeps best work. Much of the album was recorded while the band was at it's most relaxed and content at Headley Grange. You can hear interplay between the band members between songs, and even hear a prop ariplane flyover with the engineer asking to re-record, with Jimmy Page responding, \\"Naw, leave it. Yea.\\"    No rock band preceding, or succeeding, Led Zeppelin has this breadth of musical talent. Not even the Beatles or Stones. Get it. You won't be disappointed, Oh, and, turn it up!
0316017922|5.0|On one level, Malcom Gladwell is a master of the obvious. In the Tipping Point, he tells us that if enough things go well, things go really well. In Blink, he says that experts can see things non-experts cannot see. And in Outliers he shows that if you have enough advantages, you can become a big success.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about Gladwell's books is that he helps you understand why the obvious is true with careful research and dazzling prose. I believe Outliers is his best book to date.  It provides compelling facts and stories, and it's pleasure to read.<br /><br />Outliers has excellent illustrations of the childhood of pro Hockey players, the limitations of IQ, the success of Jewish lawyers, Jamaican social hierarchy, and the importance of timing.  Then there are little nuggets throughout the book, such as the research that shows job satisfaction is a function of autonomy, complexity, and connection with results.<br /><br />I read Outliers shortly after I read \\"Talent Is Overrated\\" by Geoff Colvin, and these two books make a nice pair.  To show that success is not just luck, both books cite the 10,000 hour rule -- positing that it takes 10,000 hours of disciplined practice to become an expert.  In the end, knowledge, skill and experience must connect with luck and opportunity.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1591842247 Talent Is Overrated: What Really Separates World-Class Performers from Everybody Else]]
B000001E21|5.0|One of the 90s British glam metal bands that cross over from the 80s! Thanks to them for having accompanied my youthful teenage years... The 90s British music scene will be boring without them!!!
1554072840|5.0|My daughter LOVES this book.  She identifies with Prudence and finds a sweet camaraderie in potty training with her.  I was put off at first by some of the aspects other reviewers got hung up on, but realize now that it's just what my little one needed: clear description, light-hearted humor, gentle encouragement, and a sister potty trainer.
B000065PUE|5.0|Having put this album on yet again just now, I just had to swing by here and give it some love. Because simply, it ROCKS. SO hard. The opening track alone is enough to make you burst into a violent frenzy of pure maniacal ecstasy! You put the cd on and you hear a nice, catchy bassline, then the guitar comes in followed by the drums and you think, \\"Man, this is really rockin'!\\" ..But then vocalist Black Francis comes in and just TEARS THE ROOF OFF THE PLACE. This is the kind of music you just CANNOT listen to sitting down.. my word, could there possibly be anything more amped up than this?<br /><br />Another thing I have to point out is the arrangements. This is some of the most cleverly put together rock music I have ever beheld, the way each instrument fits together ever so PERFECTLY like a sound-wave jigsaw puzzle. This is MASTERY, folks.<br /><br />In addition to all that, this album just oozes with pure attitude. You can hear it, you can FEEL it emanating from each individual band member as they hit every note, every little snare hit - there is just so much here that is absolutely genuine and pure.<br /><br />All in all, an ESSENTIAL album for anyone who digs rock music. It's easy to see why the Pixies were so influential - this is probably the #1 album that makes me want to go start a band myself.
B000000ORE|5.0|A great CD for someone who had been enjoying great metal music in our teenage years!!! Though this album's quite commercial, the skillful riffs from the rythmn guitar stand out as the main reason for my purchase of this album! Tesla really rocks in the 90s!!!
0553384775|5.0|Came highly reccomended, and I was not disappointed. Very entertaining and makes you realize that the ordinary madness in a typical person's life is nothing compared to what this maniac had going on.
B001GKO45K|5.0|Back in the bad old days of VHS, I heard about Triumph from two or three sources almost simultaneously and became curious enough to order a copy - from Amazon, I think, although I'm not certain. One source was a local teacher of non-broadcast video production; his opinion resembled several I see here now: professionally grounded and respectful of the many new techniques Fraulein Riefenstahl used (if not invented). Another was a very pragmatic member of the Nixon staff (as I recall) who was a great admirer of the efficiency of Nazi propaganda: I seem to recall him being quoted as comparing the Republican propaganda artists disadvantageously, and of saying that, compared to the Nazi propagandists, the Republicans were \\"pikers\\". Both of these opinions are entirely correct. Leni Riefenstahl and her colleagues were groundbreakers: they had to be, since no one had, at that time, been entrusted with the promulgation of a Big Lie as Big as that of the Nazis. As I watched that earlier, VHS copy of Triumph, I was struck by its likely effect in the days immediately following its release and distribution. German breasts must have swelled with pride at the wonderful achievements of Germany under the National Socialists; nonGerman audiences probably felt less excitement but little less wonder, for Triumph presents the audience with a nation bent on the New Jerusalem (although not in those words) - a new world of glory for a nation unjustly humbled in the eyes of the world. Watch Triumph in the wrong frame of mind and it is still a terrifying glimpse under the lid of Hell.
0375505091|5.0|Book arrived in PERFECT shape - which is more then I can say for the same book at the local Borders and Barns & Nobel stores (The cover was in bad shape at both places).    Thanks- Daughter loves it!
B000000OY9|2.0|After today's miracle in New York, I immediately thought of this forgettable 1986 album. I still own it on vinyl. The one good tract is \\"Touch the Night,\\" a poor man's \\"Like a Hurricane.\\" As New Jersey's biggest Neil Young fan, I half understand, but still wonder why, a minor Neil Young album title grabs my attention while I'm watching the US Airways plane floating south down the Hudson River on CNN. Secondly, I wonder whether Neil himself pondered the relevance while he watched from Australia -- he's currently there on tour. Finally, thirdly, and sadly, I did think about the poor souls on the plane. But they're alive. Hey hey, my my.  And lastly, if you own the LP, you realize that there is a cool photo of Neil sitting in an airplane seat, a flotation device strapped to his chest, the plane ready to hit water, and Neil looks scared. Real scared.
B001KVZ6FC|4.0|Splice Archie Bunker with Dirty Harry and you kind of get retired Detroit autoworker Walt Kowalski. But Kowalski cares about people more than Dirty Harry and Archie Bunker. And we learn why he is the way he is. At least part of the reason he is grouchy and kinda racist is because he has been through combat hell and it left him scared. He's a haunted man. He is from another time. His neighborhood has fallen apart and is filled with nonwhite poor people and thugs. Seems his Asian neighbors remind him of the lives he took as a young man in Korea all those years ago. Walt also squints his eyes and groans all the time because of his kids that he never connected with and are now spoiled, selfish jerks with spoiled brat selfish kids of their own whose behavior absolutely disgusts him. That the grandchildren seem like regular American kids is just depressing because they are unlikable little brats and the perspective of an old grouchy grandfather on the younger generation is both comical and truly sad. Old Walt lives out his remaining days after his wife's passing whose pathetic funeral with it's meaningless, phony eulogy and crummy, transparently uncaring family in attendance begins the film. He mows the lawn, keeps up his house, hangs out with his dog, drinks lots of Pabst Blue Ribbon (best beer for your buck imo). The priest who did the wife's funeral comes around repeatedly and tries to get him to go to confession because his wife made him promise her he would. One day a \\"gook\\" kid from next door tries to steal Walt's vintage car but gets caught. Racial epitaphs are fired off freely by Walt and it's pretty funny. Soon after the Asian Hmong gang comes around to pick on the neighbor and Walt comes out with his old M-1 rifle and scares 'em off. The Asian neighbors all appreciate this and he is awarded with many food gifts and offerings which he doesn't want. Anyway, you might can guess what comes next: Walt ends up sort of mentoring the teenage boy who is really not so bad and was just pressured into theivery. I'll leave out the details of how this relationship comes about which aren't surprising. Of coarse much worse trouble comes from the moron gang and...well I'd say go see the movie. It's pretty good. If your an Eastwood admirer GRAN TORINO is not to be missed. It's a good story. And if your white I think you'll especially like it, but I'll not get into why. In anycase it's another well crafted Clint Eastwood picture and a good story. And not everything in the narative is predictable.and was just pressured into theivery.

0525951113|5.0|This book is Mr Suarez's first and he did a wonderful job of it. I could not put the book down.     I will be looking out for the next book in the series.   The book is exciting and and really makes you think about our \\"connected\\" world and our dependance on technology and computers.
B001KMB6YG|2.0|I picked up this movie from the video store, since my wife is infatuated with Vin Diesel, and I can't remember being disappointed by any of his movies.    Until now.    The actions scenes are average, the hand-to-hand fighting flashes by on the screen so fast it is as if the filmmakers were embarrassed to even have them in the movie, and the dialog is lacking.    Heck, my wife fell asleep halfway through.  Did I mention she's infatuated with Diesel?    And yes, the futuristic aspect and the subtle stab at religion is there, but it's not worth your time or money to watch this movie.  Maybe catch it on HBO or whatever...
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|this is the feel good film of the year, i love watching it, its got all the songs from abba that i remember when i was growing up, and its such fun to see big movie stars having the time of their lives, i would say, 90% of this was fun, the other 10% was work.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I got this as a Christmas gift.  It was well received and shipped quickly.  Very satisfied.
B000W91RUG|5.0|This dvd collection helped me make it through the first semester of my freshman year of college. It is hilarious and amazing.
0143038583|5.0|Michael Pollan is a master of words...he takes you to places you really didn't want to go and explains delicately what happens there. This book has changed everything about the way I view food. His concept to discover the source of 4 meals from start to finish is revolutionary and the insights he shares about the 4 types of meals are unbelievable. I was a advocate of the \\"locavore\\" movement before I read this book and am solidly committed to the concept since I finished it! A must-read for anyone interested in healthy eating.
0316017922|5.0|I have read both of Gladwell's previous books, and this one is another fascinating achievement. The book reads much like his other books, Blink and The Tipping Point, with some overarching themes and a lot of interesting examples, data, and narratives.<br /><br />Gladwell's main point is that the nature of success is not what we traditionally think it is: a mixture of innate talent and hard work. Gladwell acknowledges the importance of these things, but he also theorizes that success takes a very precise mixture of coincidences, history, timing, culture, and upbringing, among other things. Other reviewers have noted that the book wasn't revelatory because Gladwell basically says you have to work hard and be talented to be successful; I didn't find this to be the case at all. Instead, Gladwell really made me think about success, and about the series of coincidences and mixture of things that make up who we are and what we become, differently. I had a hard time putting it down, and was fascinated by a lot of his examples and data.<br /><br />My only criticism, and it would be very slight, is that sometimes his points are a bit drawn out and repetitive. I didn't really mind this at all, because I never lost interest in the new examples he brings up to illustrate each point. I highly recommend this book and I think it would make anyone think about success in a different way.
0525951113|4.0|In the prelude to the novel, author Daniel Suarez included a technological definition of a daemon program, which is certainly one interpretation however he is silent on another possibility, one emanating from Hellenic philosophy, as a supernatural being somewhere between mortal and god, a ghost of past heroes fully capable of acts of goodness...or evil.<br /><br />The(pro?)antagonist,Matthew Sobel,though deceased at the outset of the novel, is nevertheless revealed to be a multifaceted persona: genius computer game developer and Corporate CEO, tragic cancer victim, prescient futurist and in many respects, judgmental megalomaniac. Even before his interment, he unleashes a daemon upon the world, a program with the capability, from the bowels of his computer game empire, to manipulate the lives of anyone utilizing any form of networked communications or services.<br /><br />Sobel, through the vehicle of technology can serve as svengali or poltergeist, his applications can become a dystopian executioneer to all that fall within its' purview, yet most pertinently, his daemon is designed essentially to seek out and identify the disaffected, individuals with socio-psychological, intellectual or economic predispositions likely to find his multiplicity of pre-programmed enticements attractive, whilst nearly all find themselves initially oblivious to the basic truths of circumstance...non-compliance once identified by the daemon is not an option.<br /><br />Suarez's book is a technological tour de force regardless of some instances of obsolescence as in the near decade that has passed since he first penned the story, a few of the tools his characters employed have been replaced by more sophisticated applications. Skillfully however, he avoids alienation of the less technically inclined reader by including technologically challenged characters who seek explanations from the geeks of the moment.  For me, his story encouraged comparisons to the plotlines of movies like \\"The Matrix\\" and \\"The Terminator\\" trilogies and most recently, Eagle Eye, as well as Asimov's story  \\" I, Robot.\\"<br /><br />This is a book of technological plausibility and that dominating aspect almost compensates for what I found to be thinly developed characterizations and some unnecessary ethnically engendered biases that I encountered from time to time. Suarez flippantly injects the term \\"mulatto\\" as a descriptive for some racially mixed characters while utilization does little to advance the story or effectively inform the reader. While most of the central figures never progress beyond two dimensional presentations, it ironically, is the deceased Matthew Sobel, we come to know best  and in the final analysis he might be a personality type that has brought pestilence to diverse societies since the dawn of humankind.<br /><br />Notwithstanding a few flaws, Daemon is a worthwhile read.\\" trilogies and most recently, Eagle Eye, as well as Asimov's story  \\" I, Robot.\\"     This is a book of technological plausibility and that dominating aspect almost compensates for what I found to be thinly developed characterizations and some unnecessary ethnically engendered biases that I encountered from time to time.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because it starts off slow. Kinda ho hum. Once it gets going, it's GREAT!
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna Summer returns to the fold after what seems like decades in the wilderness.<br /><br />The album starts of \\"on the good foot\\" with \\"Stamp your feet\\"; the title says it all; driving percussion, faultless production, and a lyric that sounds like a personal challenge.<br /><br />Next up is Mr. Music, another hard-driving number - though somewhat lacking in the lyrics department - that just begs to be turned up.<br /><br />Ziggy Marley shows up on the title track, a funky, bouncy kinda-sorta-reggae number. Highly Enjoyable. The pace slows down for \\"The Queen is Back\\", but it is no less relentless.<br /><br />Fame (the game) has a lyric that sounds autobiographical, but somewhat tongue-in-cheek as she cocks the proverbial snook at the trappings and superficiality of fame. \\"You're Fabulous! We love you! Fantastic! Now we have all the right property!\\"<br /><br />Time for a break; she kicks back, grabs a tall cool one and gets some \\"Sand on My Feet\\". Then it's time to hop into the car and take to the streets of Rio with the top down and the radio blaring in \\"Driving Down Brazil\\".<br /><br />The next cut - I'm a Fire - is the album's sole throwback to the Donna Summer of yesteryear, but carefully updated and modernized, though it sounds a little too \\"synthetic\\" for my test. A great one for the clubs, though.<br /><br />\\"Slide Over Backwards\\" is the one track that I don't like. A good enough effort, but it sounds like she is trying to an impression of Tina Turner, something she really did not need to do.<br /><br />\\"Science of Love\\" is one of those songs I am not sure if I like or not. She's trying to do a garage-band job; it's \\"ok\\", and that's the best I can say.<br /><br />\\"Be myself again\\" is my favorite track. Not because it's slow, but because when you slow the pace down and take away most of the technical flummery and leave only a piano, some light percussion and her voice, and she really shines. The lyrics tell a story of someone who traveled the road to stardom, only to find that they lost their soul on the way; I wonder if it is autobiographical... makes you think.<br /><br />The album closes out with \\"Bring down the reign\\", a song about Darfur. Not the best track on the CD, but not the worst either.<br /><br />The whole set reeks of hit production values - my only criticism is that some of the cuts sound a little over-produced, but certainly no song fails on that account.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that her first hit was in 1976 - Thirty-two years ago. Her last major hit - She works hard for the money - is fifteen years in the past. Her last studio album - Mistaken Identity - is seventeen years old. She was 59 years old at the time Crayons was released; she must have had a hell of a makeover for the cover shot...<br /><br />In the final analysis, however, it is the music that does the talking, and the message is that even now she can run rings around lesser divas that were not even born when she was the Queen of Disco.<br /><br />The Queen is back. Don't' just stand there - KNEEL!!utobiographical... makes you think.    The album closes out with \\"Bring down the reign\\", a song about Darfur.

B000ZN802W|4.0|This truly is a story about going into the wild.  First of all, cast off all of the things you don't need, then work along here and there, pick up what you need to survive in the wild, and then go there...and live.<br /><br />This isn't a \\"My Side of the Mountain\\" type of sanitized storyline. It's about an inexperienced young man that knows how to work and knows how to learn, going into the wild alone, finding food, and surviving (or not- you have to see the movie to find out).<br /><br />This is not a show for the younger crowd.  Don't expect high dollar special effects, just a thoughtful, intelligent telling of a true story.<br /><br />4 solid stars
B001EO2UKO|2.0|I loved No Angel and Life For Rent. I was really looking forward to hearing this new work. It is with disappointment that I have to say this just isn't a good album. The reality is, it sounds like a collection of b-sides; if it were marketed as such, I'd have less of a problem with it. It's unfortunate. The album artwork, and the beautiful photos of her are very good. But the music? It really is forgettable (her excellent voice is about the only thing that kept me from falling asleep). There's very little you want to re-hear again, unlike her previous work. Look, it's fine to feel bad for her past personal troubles. Even I feel sad for her. Maybe she had to get this slop out of her system. I suspect there is still plenty of better songs forthcoming from Dido, but you really are better off skipping this. Don't pay for it anyway, but give it a listen, if only to remind you of how good she really is in contrast to the dullness found here. I am giving it two stars, only because of one track I actually liked: \\"It Comes And It Goes\\", which sounds like the Dido we all know and love.
0743454537|5.0|The product arrived in excellent condition.  I was ordering the box for a Christmas present for my mom.  I read it for my book club and enjoyed it very much.  I could not put it down.  The characters were easy to follow.  I do not like books with too many characters.
B000002J1L|3.0|Four stars for the music.  Growing up in the early 90's, I wrote off Genesis without hesitation.  But recently I was searching YouTube and found a live version of The Musical Box and realized I was wrong all of these years (Genesis actually did make good music once).  I tried to buy the Import version of this album from Genesis but was informed it is no longer available even though it is still posted for sale.  So I bought the remastered off eBay.    Two stars for the remastering.  The Musical Box remastering is appalling.  The volume is all over the place, the bass is muddy and lost and vocals get lost in the background, making it painful to listen to.  The rest of the remastering on the CD gets better but suffers from the same problems.    One reviewer here mentioned getting the vinyl version which I will try to hunt down, hopefully it doesn't have these same issues.
B001HZ9ABM|5.0|Ok, so I bought the original album when it came out. ok, so I bought the album on reel to reel. Ok, so I bought the album when it came out on cd. Ok, so I bought the UK mono Odessa because it was never released in the U.S. I think I've pretty well covered any aspect of this classic release other than 8 track. I have been waiting for this remaster like the 1st, Horizontal, Idea package. I can't take it out of my disc player.     The best side 1 of any recording I have ever heard-Odessa, You'll Never See My Face Again, Black Diamond. It's not just pop music, it's not just rock, it's not just harmony vocals, it's not just the orchestral backing, it's not just country influences, this encompasses the spectrum of  music. Marley Purt Drive, love it, Give Your Best(ow!), Whisper Whisper, where'd this come from, Vince Melouney the forgotten lead guitarist, where'd he go. Disc 3 with demos and the scat singing that is how they developed their songs is just wonderful to listen to. Melody Fair, Edison and those fantastic three part harmonies. Maurice and his prowess as one of the first masters of the mellotron shines on disc 3. Wow. All that and nothing said about 1st of May........I'll take side b-Lamplight and the two versions on disc 3. Take it all in, it's a classic from a golden era of popular music.
B000W4KT64|5.0|The best job that travolta did. He is great!  The movies is excellent. There is fun, comedy, romance, everything!  I totally recomended. If you don't like musicals, you'll like this.
0446579939|2.0|I don't know...maybe it's the writer in me but Nicholas Sparks is regressing and this novel was no exception. I am finding that his last five novels have been exactly the same; predictable and cliche. I had a big problem with the realism in this novel. Who the hell falls in love in three days? It rubbed me the wrong way, the whole novel rubbed me the wrong way. I found it utterly ridiculous that the female in this novel would throw a fit about a guy who traveled across the country to meet her. So cheesy and lame. I love Nicholas Sparks, but he needs to think of some new ideas. I'm sick of these cheesy romances. If he wants to continue writing these types of novels, then at least make it realistic.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I order this DVD for Christmas for my daugther. She loves it. and I do too. She does not get tired of watching it again and again and again.  I totally recomend it. it's fun, the music is great (ABBA!!!) the best thing to watch in this days and forget about the problems.
1932907009|5.0|If the screenplay is the skeleton of the movie, then \\"Save the Cat!\\" is a terrific pocket-sized \\"Gray's Anatomy,\\" naming the bones from head to toe and helping the writer identify the spine that connects it all together. Snyder's intuitive, common-sense approach provides a step-by-step template to laying out your screen story, starting with genre (\\"Monster in the House,\\" \\"Golden Fleece,\\" \\"Buddy Love,\\" to name a few) and moving through about a dozen major \\"beats\\" to see your cinematic tale through from Opening Image to Midpoint to Final Image. Inspired by the monomyth presented by Joseph Campbell in his groundbreaking \\"Hero With a Thousand Faces,\\" Snyder breaks the hero's journey free from its myth-bound roots into a casual, almost conversational map (other stages are labeled \\"Fun and Games\\" and \\"Bad Guys Close In\\"), and illustrated with clear, instructive examples from popular films. Perhaps most importantly, \\"Save the Cat!\\" is simple without ever being simplistic, written in an encouraging, \\"You Can Do It!\\"-style that's compulsively readable and re-readable. Like the best reference tools, you'll find yourself turning to it again and again for guidance on your latest project and internalizing the essence of its lessons. If \\"Save the Cat!\\" has a fatal flaw, it rather brazenly calls itself \\"The Last Book on Screenwriting You'll Ever Need\\" when its sequel \\"Save the Cat! Goes to the Movies\\" (Hollywood loves a franchise) is an equally necessary compendium of popular films vivisected by Snyder into their major plot points. Like the best books out there (cf., Lew Hunter, Linda Seger, Christopher Vogler, Robert McKee), \\"Save the Cat!\\" is a great weapon in the writer's arsenal.
B00004RF9B|5.0|Forbidden Planet still excites me, even though I saw it as new in the 1950s. This is no kid matinee offering despite flyung saucers, ray guns and robot...although Robbie is a loveible character with one of the great lines in Sci-Fi: \\"I rarely use it myself, Sir. It promotes rust!\\"  when Adams remarks on the high oxygen content of Altair 4's atmosphere.<br /><br />The film is a big influence on Star Wars: George Lucas watched it constantly when writing the script and Star Trek, too. Gene Roddenberry even gave the Enterprise starship the Pennant Number 1701, the time Addams ship entered the atmostshere of Altair 4.<br /><br />I never tire of the psychological aspect of this film and the way Morbius learns to his cost that a million years of shining sanity can not protect the Krel from the monsters from the Id.<br /><br />&lt;Anne Francis (September 16, 1930 - January 2, 2011). Thank you for the happy memories of the best sci-fi film I've known.>
B00005JPF9|4.0|Very good film...what is the USA waiting for?  I want to buy the dvd already!
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|If you can get past the idea of 10th century italian weavers translating cloth imperfections into binary code ( 7, 8 or 9 bit ?  Stop bits ? Parity bits ? ) then translating the binary ( ASCII, EBCDIC ? ) into letters ( greek, latin, cyrillic ? ) and the letters into names, and get past the stolen bread van that could keep up with the Viper, and the curving bullets, etc, this could be your movie. The special effects were pretty special.
0060775858|5.0|I still own the 1947 edition of this all-time great children's book.  There are few children's books ever written that are more special.  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is perfect for putting the kids to bed with.  It will gently induce them to a state of serenity as the young rabbit in the great green room says goodnight to all in its surroundings.  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" offers the coziness of goodnight to kittens and mittens, clocks and socks, mush and the old rabbit lady whispering \\"hush.\\"    The atmosphere is still. The pages with black & white illustrations are good but not memorable; the color illustrations, however, are classic.  The great green room is balanced heavily with red and also with other colors. Does the texture everywhere tell us we in a cottage?  Perhaps, but regardless the pictures are surreal, very enjoyable as the colored pages fade from bright to dark as the night sets in.  The calming images in \\"Goodnight Moon\\" -- with the unforgettable cow jumping over the moon -- and the simple rhymes of the words truly became a part of me.   Expect the kids to love it.
B0015HZAK2|4.0|Well I was waiting for this CD to come out in it's remastered from but was Disappointed when it came out and they had only remastered the CD and had added nothing to it. Most Groups when they remaster a CD they add extra tracks to the Cd. The songs that they have on there are great but would have been better it there was more on the CD. The DVD is great
1419364375|5.0|Among the few great books I have read. I listened to it on CD with multiple readers.  Picoult has a profound sense of time, place and human emotions...and a rich command of the English language.  The characters' dialog and the scenes captured me throughout the entire book. Several scenes left me stunned and breathless or deeply touched by the depth of their humanity!  Adults and children are in the cast of characters.  Picoult wraps family dynamics...strengths and weaknesses, and professional career conflicts around the singular thread of a life and/or death situation!
0312427999|5.0|I do not know how anyone could read this book and say that it does not get you thinking in ten different ways? She brings facts and tension through out the whole book. I was in the army for 5 years so I feel she is rate on the money with what she says! Israel is more of a cause then she points out but she does point out a lot for beginners. She has some courage standing up to people like Alan Greenspan, questioning him about policies when every one else praised him. I like the Jewish writers that do not leave out facts about there fellow Jews and I commend her for that. Great Book!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|By far the best role was that of the Joker. I was blown away by this character.    I did not understand why when Batman talked he was so hard to understand. But it did not take away from the movie.
0321356683|5.0|Every professional Java programmer should read this book. Even if you don't agree with all the points brought up, the book contains excellent food for thought for those who care about their craft.
B001EO748M|5.0|Jonathon Rhys Myers is still captivating in Season 2. Where season 1 had lots of love and intimacy, this season is far more political and bloody with most of the original cast of season 1 losing their heads. Peter O'Toole is very good as the Pope but he seams to be there just for his star power rather than what he contributes to the storylines. A pity that many of the actors from season 1 were written out of season 2.    Extra features is very disappointing- full of promotion for other Showtime programs. I wanted more information behind the scenes about how the series was made eg costumes- recreating the world of Henry VIII with sets.    I hope season 3 is just as lavish and enticing as now Jane Seymor will be the leading female character.
B001F7MSFW|3.0|I for one liked the first Hellboy..but this sequel was a mixed bag for  me.On one hand it stands out as a very effective creepy horror/superhero movie;giving the audience a better look at the creatures this time..with out the use of CGI..which to me that was fantastic. So what exactly is the problem here..well the story  felt a bit forced at times. I didnt feel there was a need for a sequel in the first place..it was pretty much a sequel to get fans to watch.<br /><br />  the movie is not horrible,no that not what I said,its pretty descent..but its just theres nothing new to bring about Hellboy,sure he is back with that big gun and evrything, he is still with Liz from the first movie..so what? I wanted to see the Golden army..and all I got was 5 min..at the end. There are good moments like the fight with Prince Nuada and the gaurds..cool right?..but the rest is like..ugh, not the mention the silly love story between Abe Sapien and the Princess...very ludricous and unecessary. not the best movie this year<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 OUT OF 5
B00136JSV2|5.0|I could never figure out why Sony didn't include this one in their 2003 Dylan remastering campaign; it truly ranks as one of his best and most influential albums, and the title cut was covered many times by many artists in the first few years after Dylan first committed it to tape--The Byrds, Simon & Garfunkel, Peter, Paul & Mary and The Ian Campbell Folk Group are just a few of the names who covered \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'.\\"  To my ear, their versions were always too bouncy and bright; one former acquaintance of mine felt that Dylan \\"f***s it up\\" (!!!).  I, for one, beg strongly to differ.<br /><br />In truth, the title cut is quite probably the sunniest track on this album; it is, indeed, a dark mood for Dylan.  His star was in the ascendant, and spectacularly so at this juncture, but his personal life was troubled (his girlfriend, Suze Rotolo, was in and out of his life frequently, and he was seeing Joan Baez); he was also socially active, making trips to the South with the Freedom Riders and performing publicly in Mississippi for civil rights workers.  All this informed his songwriting (as well as his series of blank-verse poems on the cover and inner sleeve, entitled \\"11 Outlined Epitaphs,\\" as sure an indicator of his bleak mood as you'd need without hearing the music within).<br /><br />After the title track, we have \\"Ballad of Hollis Brown,\\" a song about a desperate act by a desperate man at the end of his rope with a dark suggestion of karma at the end (\\"There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm/Somewhere in the distance, there's seven new people born\\"); \\"With God on Our Side\\" takes a look at history, especially that of America, and its many conflicts within and without its borders and seems to predict Vietnam; \\"One Too Many Mornings\\" is a quiet, pensive reflection, evoking the lonely hours of nightfall of a man whose absent love is much on his mind; \\"North Country Blues\\" closes side 1 with its eulogy for a dying mining town in Minnesota's Mesabi Range, where Dylan grew up (Hibbing), the kind of song that would inform Bruce Springsteen's own takes on the fate of the blue-collar working man in America...except from the point-of-view of the abandoned daughter/wife/mother.<br /><br />\\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" opens side 2 by seeking to place blame for the assassination of Medgar Evers, a civil rights worker, not on his assassin, but on the politicians of the time who were busy fearmongering; \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" is a call-to-arms of sorts, for accountability and the fall of \\"the foes\\"; \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\" refers to Suze (without actually naming her), hinting at trouble and the thought that perhaps he'd be better off with a souvenir from her trip to Spain than with her; \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" is a tale of haves and have-nots, and the miscarriage of justice as the wealthy young antagonist gets off with a slap on the wrist for the random beating to death of the frail middle-aged protagonist (\\"Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle\\"); \\"Restless Farewell\\" closes the album with a wistful goodbye to a roomful of friends (analogous to the Irish ballad \\"The Parting Glass\\") as the singer tells of a trip to parts unknown, hoping his final impression on the assembled crowd is positive but, in the end:  \\"I'll make my stand/And remain as I am/And I'll bid farewell/And not give a damn.\\"<br /><br />One of Dylan's more underrated albums, IMO, and the remaster is excellent.  Worth having.Dylan grew up (Hibbing), the kind of song that would inform Bruce Springsteen's own takes on the fate of the blue-collar working man in America...except from the point-of-view of the abandoned daughter/wife/mother.    \\"Only a Pawn in Their Game\\" opens side 2 by seeking to place blame for the assassination of Medgar Evers, a civil rights worker, not on his assassin, but on the politicians of the time who were busy fearmongering; \\"When the Ship Comes In\\" is a call-to-arms of sorts, for accountability and the fall of \\"the foes\\"; \\"Boots of Spanish Leather\\" refers to Suze (without actually naming her), hinting at trouble and the thought that perhaps he'd be better off with a souvenir from her trip to Spain than with her; \\"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\\" is a tale of haves and have-nots, and the miscarriage of justice as the wealthy young antagonist gets off with a slap on the wrist for the random beating to death of the frail middle-aged protagonist (\\"Doomed and determined to destroy all the gentle\\"); \\"Restless Farewell\\" closes the album with a wistful goodbye to a roomful of friends (analogous to the Irish ballad \\"The Parting Glass\\") as the singer tells of a trip to parts unknown, hoping his final impression on the assembled crowd is positive but, in the end:  \\"I'll make my stand/And remain as I am/And I'll bid farewell/And not give a damn.\\"    One of Dylan's more underrated albums, IMO, and the remaster is excellent.

B001AU8ZLK|5.0|So after realizing that 7+ months later I *still* was not tired of hearing the single \\"Viva La Vida\\" on the radio, and Amazon offering this album in their $5 sale, I finally caved and bought the whole album (which I rarely do.)<br /><br />After the first listen-through it was clear that the overall sound was closer to their follow up singles Violet Hill and Lovers in Japan than VLV. Honestly those songs as singles didn't hook me in as instantly as VLV did, but they absolutely work as part of the flow of this album. This is one of those rare discs that I've enjoyed listening the whole way through...so much that I bought the Prospekt's March EP a few days later.<br /><br />The instrumentation and layering of sound is just gorgeous (and I found a new appreciation of Lovers In Japan after listening through headphones), and the songs have structures that are unusual without being messy. Also -- there's quite a variety in styles packed in these tracks but they still preserve this overall mood of melancholy with breaks of light and color coming through.<br /><br />My favorite tracks include Cemeteries in London, 42, Lovers in Japan, Yes, and Viva La Vida, but the album definitely works as a unified entity rather than just a collection of \\"singles\\" and \\"not-singles\\". If you enjoy this disc I highly recommend getting the Prospekt's March EP too.
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is really quite a masterful experience. All the songs on here are flawless notable ones being:One step closer,With you,Runaway,By myself,In the end, A place for my head and pushing me away.This cd is probably one of my most played cds that I own. Definetely pick this one up its fantastic.
B001HDO4Z6|4.0|...it's definitely worth your while to get this EP. Like previous reviewers I feel the majority of these tracks are strong enough to have gone onto the main album -- I'm sure there were other factors at work in not including them.    It's pretty much the same \\"feel\\" as Viva La Vida. Prospekt's March, Rainy Day and Glass of Water were standout new songs for me, and I liked Life in Technicolor II (longer version w/vocals). Probably the only \\"off\\" moment was the Lost+ remix, but that may be personal bias since Lost wasn't one of my faves off the main album anyway.
B0001JXQEM|5.0|As most of you know weezer's first album is amazing. Every song on here is fantastic. But the deluxe edition is a bit different it has the original album plus a bonus disc full of live tracks kitchen tapes and b-sides. If you are a hardcore weezer fan such as myself you are absolutely eat this up if not pick up the original album. This album is a bit pricey so make sure your a big weezer fan if you pick this up
B00005JPSM|4.0|Enjoyed this movie though it's a somewhat old story line.  Decent acting.  Drama with the comedy.
B0000028RR|4.0|This album really started the rapmetal scene. This is an excellent album featuring some really great songs on it.  Hits:Bombtrack       Killing in the Name       Bullet in the Head       Wake Up       Fistful of Steel        Freedom        Settle for Nothing  Alright tracks:Take The power back                 Know your enemy                 Township rebellion  Overall this album is great there are a few songs that I didnt care for but they are not even bad they just feel a bit filler.Pick this album up

B0011NVC98|1.0|I studied English for a while in University before changing my major and Beowulf has always been one of my favorite tales of all time. It was so excited when I first heard that a film version was being made because I thought that with the technology of today they could finally make a good version. I was horribly disappointed and almost ashamed that this film should even try to associate itself with the epic. In the beginning I was able to forgive some of the changes because I though they were trying to make his character more human, but it soon just got out of hand. The scene with Grendel's Mother reminded me more of MacBeth than Beowulf, making me wonder if the writers had only read the Spark Notes version of the tale.    Friends I have spoken to who have not read the original enjoyed the film for its effects and action sequences, but even they admit that the story itself was somewhat lacking. If Grendel is the child of Grendel's Mother and Hrothgar, logically, should not Beowulf's child with Grendel's Mother look the same? Why is it a dragon? Such inconsistencies in the butchered retelling make it impossible to appreciate even as a movie in its own right.    Not to mention that no self respecting Viking would kill themselves in the manner that Hrothgar did. They put a shame on my heritage.    Yes, the graphics were amazing and the acting was quite good, but as a retelling of the ancient tale it is indeed the worst I have seen.  Everyone should just forget that this film was ever made.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I've had this unit for about a year now. I bought extra batteries right from the get go, because I know how these battery powered/rechargables are. Nothing worse than needing to use it, and finding the battery is dead, and you have to wait 6 hours for it to charge.<br />Anyway, for quick crumb pick ups on NON-SCULPTED / NON-LOOP STYLE TYPE CARPETS OR on hardwood/laminate/tile/vinyl foors is OK.<br />If you have looped carpeting, and you get a snag.....  it will rip the carpet loops right out. Also, if you have sculpted carpet, the brushs cant grab the crumbs sitting lower, since this doesnt use SUCTION.....only brush power to lift up the crumbs.<br />The worst part of this unit is the size of the collection cup. IT'S HORRIBLE. It MIGHT hold 1/2 cup dirt of fuzz. If you forget to empty it every 5 minutes ( if your battery holds out that long) it wont pick up any more dirt.  No WHEELS either. It's got those teflon pads on the bottom. It does swivel, it is light, it does have a long handle and it does do a nice job picking up crumbs and small debris, but it DOES NOT TAKE THE PLACE of a good vacuum.
159448385X|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns shares the same poignant prose that brought  Khaled Hosseini so much well-deserved praise for The Kite Runner.  It is a colorful as well as  heartwrenching novel; one that captures your mind and will not let it go. It tells the complex story of two women and how life in Afghanistan profoundly affects who they are, their relationship with one another, and their relationship with the world.    1000 Suns is vividly relayed with eloquence and suspense, making it hard to put the book down. It twists your heart with pain for the main characters and will not let it go as you realize that the fate of these women was not and is not so very different from women who live out their lives daily under the existing conditions of Afghanistan.  Hosseini has a special gift for weaving the mundane subtleties of life into the background of the Soviet invasion, the chaotic civil war, the eventual misogynistic Taliban rule.  The women are helpless to change their fate as they suffer at the hands of a cruel husband and a paternalistic society that provides them with no means of recourse.    I recommend this book with mixed emotion.  Thin themes of personal dignity sporadically provide relief from the series of hardships that fill the lives of these women.  But, the overarching theme of abuse, loss of dignity, and a life destroyed by events that were inescapable largely because of gender and status makes for a difficult read.   It is definitely a book that everyone will grow from - just don't take on vacation.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|this is one sexy christmas album! All her albums are great and shes just awesome and i hope she comes out with more cds, b/c ill buy them.

B00004YZFR|5.0|I'm going to review this from a different perspective, that of a member of the crowd at this infamous show.  As the documentary indicates, the site was thrown together at the last minute due to problems securing permits in the Bay Area.  As a result, the crew was frantically building the stage, setting trailers in the backstage area and erecting lighting columns literally hours before the show.  My friends and I turned up early in the evening the night before the show and (along with others) helped the crew carry building supplies around the site.  Can you imagine this happening in today's world when 20 semis pull up backstage and there are hundreds of union guys handling the rigging?  While it was my intent to jam right up against the stage, my friend reasoned that we should sit back about fifty feet in order to hear the sound mix better.  If you watch the film carefully, you'll notice that almost all of the violence took place within 20 feet of the stage. This leaves the impression that the entire crowd was involved in the middle of some horrible nightmare.  At fifty feet from the stage, we could certainly see a lot of what was going down and the vibe was far from pleasant, but I never felt in any sort of danger and sure wasn't about to bail on one of the Stones' greatest live performances ever.  Remember, there were approximately 300,000 people there and I'd guess that less than 20,000 of us (at least those without binoculars) really saw what was happening.  I have friends that sat way up the hillside and partied through the entire day; their only awareness of any problems came as a result of the stage announcements.    I'm not saying the Maysles did a poor job re-creating what happened that December day in 1969.  There was little time to plan shot sequences and the lack of lighting pretty much forced the cameramen to work within a few feet of the stage area.  Nor am I denying that some horrible things took place that day.  What I am trying to say is that thingsweren't necessarily as bad as they seemed on film.  It's still a great film.    I only wish that the entire Altamont show was released as part of the bonus section of this DVD.  A Blu-Ray re-issue would be nice as well.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|This is another classic movie from Clint Eastwood. As both director and leading actor he shows here why he has been a star and quality director for so long. But its in his choice of material where I think Eastwood is very clever. This story has a lot of messages about human nature; both the good and the bad. The characters develop as the film progresses and you will care about them. Its a great story, which combined with Eastwoods steady hand as a director produces a memorable film overall.<br /><br />He plays a Korean war vet who is living in an area populated with ethnic minorities (who are now the majority) and his character is very racist. A lot has been said about Eastwood's acting performance in this film. I don't think he will win an Oscar (but hope he does), but if this is his last acting role then he has gone out in style. At age 78 he still has that undefinable quality that most other actors can only dream about. The huge screen prescence, charisma and still the meanest looking son of a ***** when he gets angry.<br /><br />Hopefully the DVD released will provide a commentary as the background to the making of this film should be fascinating.
031606792X|4.0|As many others here I am a late comer to the Twilight series, I didn't start reading it until after the I saw the movie.  I read many of the reviews for Breaking Dawn and was almost afraid to read it because so many were negative.  But I loved this book, I thought it was actually better than the others because it did seem as though the characters grew up.  With one exception....Jacob.  I truly believe that the story line of Jacob, and Bella's obsession with him, should have ended with New Moon.  The whole series was about the love between Bella and Edward and Jacob was just and annoying intrusion.  Too bad....
B000H30B2C|5.0|The 1933 version of King Kong has always been on my '10Best Movies List' since boyhood. I hated the 70's remake as it denigrated the original. The only thing good in that version was Jessica Lange. This extended version of Peter Jacksons remake not only honors the original but pays homage to it. When I heard Jackson's next project after LOTR was to be King Kong, I became so excited, I just couldn't wait. I believed that if he treated Kong with the same respect & reverence as LOTR, then all Kong fans everywhere were going to get knocked off their feet; big time! We were not disapointed. Like other reviewers, I just can't understand why they chose to leave these extended scenes out of the original theater run. After all, Jackson fans proved their loyalty by waiting close to five years to see all the chapters of LOTR, right! As good as the theatrical release was, this extended version of King Kong like the extended versions of LOTR, raise it to a higher level. Jackson also brings to fruition the original concepts of Merian C. Cooper & Edgar Wallace. We see King Kong as it was intended to be seen 72 years ago, in it's entirety. Jackson brings this new version of King Kong to the screen with an absolute respect, intimacy & love, thereby elevating it to just about surpass the original. A lot of bunk has been stated re: the choice of Jack Black and or his over the top portrayal of Denham. To me Black creates a kind of Orson Welles figure in all of his arrogance, posturing, con man antics & wunderkind greatness. The upstart who's vision is beyond the comprehension of studioheads. How else do you play a character like that but over the top? Jackson also gives us just enough inferences to the original to make fans of the original stand up and take notice, smile inwardly, and gasp, \\"Wow\\"! Ex: Filming within a film, Ann aboard the ship, hints of musical pieces from the original soundtrack floating about the new soundtrack, the natives costumes & dance on the NY stage. The developing relationship between Ann & Kong is superb. Ann is scared to death, she has no idea what's going to become of her so she pulls out of her arsenal every desperate trick in the book to entertain Kong, biding time until she can attempt an escape. The movie needs to develop this storyline. Without it how else could any reference to Beauty & the Beast have any relevance, any true meaning? The 'sunset scene' just grabs your heart and when it's reprised at dawn in NY, Ann & Kongs relationship comes full circle. Jackson takes the time to show how admiration, respect & love could grow between these two unlikely beings, and how one would risk death to save the other countless times. How the other's emotion could bring uncontrolable tears and anguish witnessing the attack & death of the creature. You have to build these things over time folks. You have to create distinct characterizations, introduce them,allow time to become familar with them, give them the opportunity to stand out, so that when these characters suffer or die,; you feel it! Jackson is a master at this. He creates novels of moving images on screen. Uh, excuse me; isn't that what great movie making is all about! The other thing I must comment on is Jacksons use of CGI. It's incredible! With his work, you cannot tell where reality leaves off & CGI takes over. If you're one who loves an adventure, loves to be taken on a journey, loves exceptional movies, Then Peter Jackson's King Kong is the movie for you. If you loved the original 1933 version and know it well, then you will not be disapointed. I must also take my hat off to Amazon for offering this version because not very many places retail or online, are carrying it. Amazon's price is a definite plus too.
0439023483|5.0|As soon as I opened up the book Hunger Games I could not put it down. It was brilliant. I felt for the characters, especially the narrator Katniss. Rooting for her the entire time while she was in the Hunger game. The friendships made in the game had me moved and at some times I had a hard time reading the book with out almost crying :P I don't usually do that on books. It really got my emotions!<br />It is really hard to say stuff without spoiling it for others, but it was a great book! I can't wait until the next book, I can't believe how it ended I wanted to know more! I wanted to Know what happened next!
B001GQACGE|1.0|My god, once again another horrible Pop Album. I AM...Sasha Fierce isn't worth a review. I brought the album listen to it and was very disappointed. The first cd has great lyrics and thats about it. Beyonce can sing but she lacks personality within the songs. Which makes them unpleasant. Especially, \\"If I Was A Boy\\" all I got out of that song was the hook. And Beyonce brought in a lot of those great song writers and still adds her name as co-writer. Not Really.     Then the second and worst of the two. Sasha Fierce, Where is she? Who is she? There was nothing fierce in the songs. \\"Video Phone\\" now beyonce wrote that song. Nothing good about that song it was a drag. The best song on Sasha Fierce is \\"Scared Of Lonely\\". It was produced amazingly by Rodney Jerkins. Nothing fierce about that song, but it is an awesome song.    Overall I want the consumers to know don't waste your money. B-Day was a good album it had direction, no meaning, But direction. I AM... SASHA FIERCE is her WORST album to date.
1423323270|5.0|Connelly's Heironymous Bosch is named after a Renaissance painter who specialized in fanciful and gruesome visions of hell from high above and detailed looks at the tortures that it holds for its residents. Heironymous Bosch is designed to be our guide through the modern hell of Los Angeles - at least that's the way it seems to the Hollywood Homocide Division.<br /><br />Fittingly, this book starts with Harry Bosch watching a wildfire burn part of the canyon below his home. His thoughts are interrupted with a radio call about a homocide and Bosch descends the mountain into the madness. A long, complicated case unrolls for Bosch and I will go no further so as to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />Dick Hill read this installation of the Bosch series with a great deal of skill. It was a joy to listen and was the best thing about my commute for more than a week.<br /><br />While not the best of the series that does not mean it is not an excellent book. I consider this to be one of the best series going right now and am happily working my way through them.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for my husband and he has really enjoyed watching it.  My Dad was a POW in WWII and this series really seems true to life from what I've heard about the war.
0312383320|5.0|I do not usually write reviews but I want to write this one because of the few bad reviews. I have read and liked all of the Stephanie Plum books, and some are better than others.<br />If you have read this series, you already know what to expect and this novel continues the crazy life of Stephanie Plum.  I did find this one really funny. I am an animal lover and they just added to the charm of this story.<br />Stephanie once again sets out to catch the bad guys and as usual, she gets in way over her head. This time, Diesel comes back into her life and once again, everything goes really crazy.<br />I loved the monkey Carl, the fire farter, and Lula this time around. How could you not laugh at them? I do admit, some of the others were a little over the top.<br />Morelli, Ranger, Wulf, & Diesel all added extra steam to the story while the rest of the cast just made you smile.<br />I recommend this book to any Stephanie Plum follower. This \\"In-Between-the-novel\\" took me away from todays current burdens and made me laugh out loud.<br />Good job Janet Evanovich, thanks for taking me away.

0882847953|4.0|I started drumming a couple of months ago. For 3 months I watched youtube and other drumming DVDs. I liked it but did not sound very good. About 2 months ago I got a teacher and his requirement was this book to start.<br /><br />Two weeks with this book I learned more and understand more then the three months I played before. My instructor would show me how it would sound and how to practice with this book. I would go home and practice for a couple of hours a week.<br /><br />You will get what you put into this book. For beginners, this book will make you better. You just have to put the time/work into using it. With a good teacher and this book, you can improve even faster.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />After playing drums for a couple of years now, I really think that this book is a strong selection for your library. I have since moved to other books and learned a ton of new beats and rhythms. I still find myself coming back to this book. I am using it to inspire drum fill ideas. Just moving the snare this around the toms or sometimes splitting the hits between the snare and cymbal. Very strong book if you use it.

B00005JL96|4.0|The box was in great condition and looked to have everything inside it the way it is suppose to. i was disappointed though in the fact that the dvd has a bad enough scratch on it that at a certain area of the movie it stops and then resumes again about a minute later. luckily it is only in one place in the movie that it does this in but it was still a bit disappointing. for the price i got it for though i guess i can not be to upset.
B00004U8JV|5.0|this movie is just as good as the first, with its amazing music and thrilling attack scenes, it doesent dissapoint!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Yet again, Malcom Gladwell makes some sense of this absurdly nonsensical society in which we live.
B000GIXEIG|2.0|This movie was very choppy, the lines sucked.  The accents were existent in ALL dialects.  The only things that were this movies saving graces were its sharp foul language, and the select scenes of Iceland.  Otherwise the king's realm was lacking.  It looked like he had 20 people to govern over, and the only building existing was his mead hall on the hill.  Yet they had beautiful clothing for the queen.  Where was all this made?    Sarah Polley was horrible.  No hint of an accent at all, and her lines were lacking enthusiasm as well as timing sometimes.  Her uppity attitude didn't seem to flow with the movie either.      Very interesting twist on how Grendel lost his arm, and even the beginning of the story. . .  The reason why Grendel is so angry and blood thirsty.  Also it had a lot more pagan flavor than I expected.  It was refreshing actually, but not that deep.    Very unbelievable, yet I watched it because of Gerard Butler, and Tony Curran.  But just because a few guys fro 300 and/or 13th Warrior were in this, obviously didn't make it a good movie.  Want a better Viking movie?  13th Warrior.  At least the story flowed better, the accents were adequate, and the characters lines were fitting.  I don't recommend it.
0553378384|5.0|Belongs in your Astrology book collection! Jan Spiller does a excellent job at describing, in-depth, the drives and characteristics associated with our north nodes.  I would describe our north node as our life purpose, and soul's potential, whereas the south node is our soul's pattern, patterns that we are use to, that are familiar to us, that can help or hinder us in this lifetime.  Jan focuses, not so much on the past issues of south node, but on the potential of our north node.  It is astonishing when you read about yourself and the people in your life, your boss, your best friend, your husband.  It sheds light on their shadow self, and on the side of them that is yearning to be free from the past to reach full potential.  It helped me to be more compassionate with people that I once could not understand, or that were downright maddening.  Now, I use the knowledge of their north node to encourage their soul's potential, (as well as my own).  While it does touch on house placements, it is concise and accurate and very useful in promoting understanding and compassion.
B00000G3PA|1.0|Armageddon (1998) I think that title's short for \\"Armageddon sick and tired of overly adrenalized adventure movies where every piece of mechanical equipment breaks down when it is most needed.\\" Well, maybe not, but in any case we got oil man Bruce Willis and his colorful crew of rowdy roughnecks trying to save us from a giant asteroid headed right for Earth. They are hired to shuttle out to the big space rock, drill a deep hole, and chuck in a nuclear bomb in order to split the asteroid in two and save the day. But that's after a lengthy and fairly amusing NASA training session for the lovably wacky oil guys. Finally, they take off to intercept the giant pet rock from hell, but unfortunately, this is where the overabundance of prefab crises overwhelms any entertainment value the movie had in the early reels. At two and a half hours, the audience has way too much time to think about implausible action scenes; lightning fast editing that makes the implausible action scenes difficult to follow; and to ponder questions like \\"why are there big giant machine guns mounted on the space rock dune buggies?\\" So, I'd chalk this one up as a loss. Also with Ben Affleck (Phantoms), Liv Tyler (Empire Records), and Steve Buscemi (Con Air).
0716748789|2.0|This book gave no specifics or real depth on many of the topics presented.  Clear evidence of this is seen with the end of the chapter problems, which are repeatedly unsolvable when the text is used exclusively.  On numerous occasions I had to go to other texts (such as Miessler's 4th ed.) in order to properly solve and understand complex problems/theories.  Further this book is very heavy and rather cumbersome for the mobile/bike-riding student.  One good thing is that all answers are given for practice and end of chapter problems which is helpful.  I would only recommend this book as a supplement to other more comprehensive texts and at $60 (used), it's not too overpriced to add to a collection but not necessary either, IMO.
B000RPTQ1C|3.0|What can I say? I'm a huge Coldplay fan, but they've started to get way too into their own stardom, and their songwriting has become spotty as a result. You can see the self-indulgence in some of these songs trying to be more than they need to. Not to say there aren't a few great songs here - there are (in particular 42, Yes, and Cemetaries of London), but overall, it's just slightly above average. Still - worth getting if you're a Coldplay fan.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking Dawn uses the viewpoints of both Bella and Jacob, adding to the layers in this saga. the end comes all too soon, leaving the reader wanting more.
B000F8O35U|3.0|I am generally not at all critical or cognizant of DVD quality, but those that have noted that the colors/animation on the DVD are dark are right.  I have a VHS tape, but borrowed the DVD because the VCR is in another room.  It looked awful.
0553381695|5.0|Westeros is being carved up, and Joff, Stannis, Renly, Robb, and Balon all have a place at the table. The War of the Five Kings has begun. If anything, this is a story about how pride goes before the fall. You see self-styled kings turn on each other like animals when there is every advantage to joining forces. Sometimes it's comical, like when Stannis and Renly meet for their tête-à-tête. Other times it's tragic. And while the high lords play their game of thrones, the kingdom sinks deeper and deeper into misery. I could go on and on, but better reviews have already covered the same subjects. Overall ASOIAF is amazing in how deftly it handles questions of love, family, duty, loyalty, and blind ambition.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Being a borderline fan/admirer of shock/exploitation films from the late 60's to the early 80's I'd known about Pasolini's film for quite a few years before actually getting my hands on a copy.    I hesitate to say that it was well worth the wait, but what I can say is that it's a film filled with disturbing images that I will never forget.    The film can be, and has been, interpreted in many different ways, two of the most popular:    (1) A film against fascism. To depict tyrannical rulers as unsympathetic, cold, heartless beasts.  (2) A shock film. Nothing more, nothing less.    Now, the people who believe the film to be nothing more than a quick shock film have obviously something wrong with them. Pasolini was an artist of the highest degree, and this was his vision, his creation, his voice against fascism: that it absolutely destroys people in every form, mentally and physically.    One of the main aspects of the film that disturbs me the most is, as an existentialist, these men, the fascists, choose to do this out of their own free will, and enjoy every single moment, every minute, every second of it, with a greater degree of bliss than a fat kid in a candy store placed right next to a Burger King.    So, in summary, I sincerely believe that Salo is, without a doubt, one of the most powerful films of the last 50 years, and that if you're not moved in any way after viewing it, you've been utterly desensitized and have lost all credibility as a human being.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|This is a great farewell film for Clint Eastwood.<br />He plays the crotchety bigoted Korean war vet to perfection.<br />Most of the other actors are virtual unknowns but do well with they're roles.<br />this film is very very touching and heartfelt. prepare to laugh ,cry,to feel happiness and to feel anger.<br />Eastwoods character attempts to vent hatred towards his Asian neighbors but eventually becomes closer to them than to his own family ,especially the young Asian boy and his sister.<br />he becomes somewhat of a hero in the neighborhood and keeps the bullies in check for awhile.<br />There is so much irony and pseudo symbolism at the conclusion of this movie I hope people have the capacity to understand it's important message.<br />This is first rate entertainment from a first class guy.
0385340990|5.0|I picked this up just because the title intrigued me (and the description of the book once I had seen the title).  It worked out well.<br /><br />The book, set during the 1940s in England, and follows an author as she begins to know a group of people from Guernsey with whom she exchanges letters.  The writing style of the correspondence is a style I often enjoy and a break from straight novel type writing.<br /><br />I am not sure if the title helps or hurts the book and whether people have been turned away by the title along.  Hopefully not, because this is a good one.
B000VWU2TQ|5.0|Show me the way is my favorite.  \\"Ah wan chu-u-u ... to show me the way.\\"  Love that talky wah-wah guitar.  It never, ever gets old.  Somehow these songs make me feel like there are 99,999 other people in an arena with me and it's 1976 all over again.  I also downloaded Baby I love your way, but nothing else from Comes Alive (although I still might, it would be fun to have Do you feel like we do).  I also like his Live in Detroit, but there is nothing in the world like Comes Alive.    When Comes Alive came out, people who liked Humble Pie and live Cream wondered if Comes Alive was too accessible, too pop.  It is, kinda, but you can't help being blown away by the incredible energy, the showmanship, the sincerity and his overwhelming chops, plus the super-tight band.  And then there's that talky wah-wah thing.  You just gotta surrender and love it.  Come on, show me that air guitar.  Nice moves!
B001GKYBX0|5.0|Another classic that should read the new Paul McCartney album!!  By the way \\"Press To Play\\" Rocks and I'd grade it a 4 star album!!!    Never listened to a Record Review in my life.    John L. Book  Palm Springs, Ca.
0307346617|5.0|I think the abundance of 5 star ratings pretty much sums it up.  No need to be long winded here...this, along with probably \\"The Rising\\" by Brian Keene, are the essential books to own in contemporary Zombie fiction.    This book helped zombie fiction (and apocalyptic horror) to reboot and pretty much turned it on it's head.  Both this book and The Rising are on their way to the big screen soon enough, so jump on the bandwagon now.
0743454529|2.0|This book starts off amazing. But the ending ruins the entire thing for me. Very disapointing and a cop out. As others have said, this book is about tough choices and the auther, in the end, breaks the tone of her own novel.

B001MW0J2E|5.0|Finally Animal Collective seems...collected, resulting in their most fluid album to date. While I clearly can't claim this to be the best album of '09 yet, I don't shy from saying that it is the best album since 2000 (Kid A), and is proving to be my personal favorite. This music is life-affirming and can't receive a higher recommendation from me.
B00005JLWN|4.0|The package was sent fastly, just a few days after I ordered it. The only problem is that I can't play the DVD (Region 1) on my DVD player (I have to use the PC). Next time, I'll take that into account and I'll read up to the end of the page.
B000002HHB|5.0|Don't buy this CD if you aren't spiritual.  If you sincerely love a uniquely exquisite voice, if you're willing to open your heart to a masterpiece.....this is THE album.  You'll never forget it.
B00005T30L|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! Not everyone will get it. It's funny in a subtle way and you mix it with weirdness and sometimes creepy. I like some of the music in the film, and the colorful clothes. I was disappointed that they haven't put all of the deleted scenes with the DVD. There was a scene with Enid and Josh but they took it out of the film but didn't bother to leave it as one of the deleted scenes. Another deleted scene is on the back of the DVD box where they spend time with Grandmother and that isn't in the movie and it's not in the deleted section. If they did exactly how the screen play goes, then there are a LOT of deleted stuff that I would like to see. This movie is so much fun to watch and there was a time where I had to see this movie everyday because I enjoyed it so much. Even though Scarlett Johansson became a hottie star, but I always thought Thora Birch was Sexier and more Hotter.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|These are wonderful for sitting back and enjoying the music.  The ear contour frequency response can dress up an MP3 like a treat.  Everything through these headphones sounds fantastic.<br />Unfortunately that makes them practically useless for analytic purposes and they should never be taken into a studio.  These \\"sound like\\" a concert.  That step comes after mixing, not during, and not before.  Keep these at home and enjoy their bliss.  They're not for work.
B000H5V8DG|3.0|While the packaging looks cool and the series is cool there is a major problem with this box set.    International Customers of Amazon Beware...... Avoid buying this box set.  I purchased in 2007 and while it was advertised as a complete collection.... its not.  I am missing a disc but have a duplicate of another disc.  After speaking with retailers in New Zealand this is a known fault and problem with this set and most DVD retailers are chosing not to stock this time.  What makes it even more challenging for International Customers is the extremely poor returns policy held by Amazon.  I have a glorified door stop in my lounge due to the hassles I have been having.  Its a real shame, because I really enjoyed watching Jennifer Garner in this series and was looking foward to watching it again.... sadly it is not to be.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|Gilmore Girls is the best television series out there.  It creatively delves into the complexities of human relationships, both romantic and mother-daughter.  The main Gilmore girls-- Rory, Lorelai, and Emily-- develop into poignant characters throughout each episode's clever plots and witty dialogue.  Each character is extremely realistic and you will find yourself wanting to travel to Stars Hollow or Hartford and meet these people!  The entire series must be watched by anyone wanting a comedy-drama that combines intelligent cultural references with decent, fun, unique, and memorable characters!
006056251X|5.0|I love the Wallflower series, but so far this is my favorite.  St. Vincent is the perfect tortured hero, and Lisa Kleypas goes deep into his characterization--what a complex, fascinating man.  The bad boy with the good heart.  Love it!

B000W1V7K4|3.0|Good movie though not on a par with Ocean's 11. The chemistry between the characters is fantastic as ever and the mrs got her dose of eye candy which is why I bought the movie in the first place.    The HD conversion really brought my experience of this movie down to the ground. The picture was grainy, colours were off leaning heavily to the red end of the spectrum. I spent half an hour checking the settings of my TV and player without any improvement.   I then slipped in the Dark Night (which in hindsight I should have done right at the beginning) and got the gorgeous picture you'd expect.     It seems the studio and / or distributor rushed the conversion on this one so save your money and just buy the DVD!    Movie: 3.5 / 5  Picture: 1 / 5  Sound: 3/5
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears A Who! is a feature-length, theatrical quality movie for viewers of all ages, based on the classic children's book \\"Horton Hears a Who!\\" by Dr. Seuss. Though the movie is rated G, the writing and wonderful computer-animated visuals dare to offer a strong measure of sophistication (even the likes a subtle Kissinger political joke), resulting in a show that will quite literally appeal to viewers age five to one hundred and five. The atmosphere and cheerful personalities, voiced by talented actors Jim Carry and Steve Carrell (and a prideful villainess perfectly captured through the performance of Carol Burnett) are faithful to the original story, creating a vivid world of whimsy and wonder. The story itself revolves around Horton, a big-hearted if somewhat goofy elephant, and the only one in the jungle with ears that can hear the entire civilization of Whoville, which happens to live on a minuscule floating speck. Horton's quest to find a safe home for the speck and its resident Whos is complicated by a dictatorial Kangaroo who remains adamant in her conviction that if she can't hear the Whos herself, then they don't exist! Special features include director's commentary, a bonus Ice Age short, making-of videos, and a fascinating look at real-life elephants. The digital copy special edition of Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears A Who! features two discs - one with the DVD movie and a host of special features, and a \\"digital copy\\" disc with a file that can be easily transferred to one's PC, iPod, or other compatible player for easy portable viewing. A wonderful gift for any season of the year, highly recommended. 2 discs, 86 minutes, English/Spanish/French audio.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I absolutely love Supernatural and I'm so glad that I purchased this set. I can and will be watching these DVD's over and over and enjoying every minute of it. I have been watching the show since the start and now mid season four after I bought season one I realized how much it was like discovering it all over again. I bought this as a little Christmas gift to me this year and I couldn't be happier with my choice. I spent the day after Christmas curled up on the sofa under a nice warm blanket and having a little season one marathon. Having all that Winchester action at my fingertips was highly enjoyable abd I would absolutely recommend buying this to everyone I know and I already have turned quite a few of my friends into Supernatural fans as a matter of fact.

B00004TH7Z|5.0|This is often regarded as Iron Maiden's comeback album after a lean run in the late 90s. Reunited with their lead singer and adding a third guitarist to the line-up, Brave New World features straight-forward metal classics (\\"The Wicker Man\\", \\"The Mercenary\\"), and mellower, introspective and intricate epics (\\"Blood Brothers\\", \\"Brave New World\\", \\"The Nomad\\"). Stylistically very similar to the two albums that followed it, but Maiden have established themselves enough that it never gets old.
0440237688|4.0|Children shouldn't be the only readers of Lois Lowry's classic best selling novel. The fact that there are over 3,000 reviews tells something. The book is a must read in schools and now I know why. The book starts off with Jonah, a boy who will be twelve years old, and be given responsibilities beyond his imagination.     Jonas and his family live in a world where there are no feelings, no colors, no imagination, no creativity, no planning, and a book of rules which I wished went with it.    Jonas is chosen as the one to be the receiver and he goes to the elder man who is known as the Giver. The book reminded me of George Orwell's 1984 and a cultish scenario.    I would recommend parents reading this book with their children and they will have a lively, interesting discussion to broaden their own minds and communicate with each other. This book can bring both adults and children together in appreciation for the choices that we have and can make in our world.    I would have given it five stars but I think that the author could have used useful tools like explaining the book of rules, maps, and illustrations to help envision this strange environment but still it's an excellent book and I would definitely teach it in the schools.    This book will make you appreciate life a little more and even the littlest things. A movie is in the works.
0714844659|5.0|If I were in Paris now, you could find me having lunch at Rose Bakery, 46 rue des Martyrs.<br /><br />It's my favorite restaurant in Paris --- and I've never been there.<br /><br />But I have Rose Carrarini's book, and it conveys so much of the spirit of her establishment that I know I'd love to be at Rose Bakery --- not just for her food, but for the ambiance, the people who work there, the regular customers and, above all, the idea that drives it.<br /><br />Home cooking.<br /><br />An unreal idea, huh? But there it is. \\"My intention was always to dissolve the distinction between home and restaurant cooking,\\" Rose says. And so she works from a Bible with just three commandments: \\"simple\\" and \\"natural\\" and \\"homemade.\\"<br /><br />The restaurant --- a one-time storage room for fruit carts --- is just as elemental. Concrete-and-metal tables on a bare concrete floor. White walls. No display window. Open kitchen. Staff in white aprons. And a single splash of color: a large abstract painting on a back wall.<br /><br />Rose's Bakery is also a shop. The packaging is plain. There's not even a web site.<br /><br />And yet, I'm told, this total anomaly --- an English bakery in the capital of France --- is beloved by foodies and cool kids alike. \\"Le meilleur brunch de France,\\" says Le Figaro.<br /><br />What makes it great?<br /><br />Rose tells a story that says a lot. It's about a meal she had at the Hyakumizon restaurant in Tokyo. She was served a dish of carrots. \\"No sauce,\\" she recalls. \\"No garnish...The taste was intense and exquisite, and was mostly of the carrot itself. Possibly blanched, cooked, cooked again in a dashi and flashed under a grill, this was one of the most humble yet delicious dishes we have ever had the privilege of tasting. Whatever the technique the chef had used, I was convinced that you don't need any fuss or flourish, as it's the flavour of the dish that counts.\\"<br /><br />She learned that lesson well. Rose Bakery now produces 90 per cent of the food and products it sells. And the proprietors are sticklers for freshness --- today's leftovers will never be tomorrow's special. As her husband and partner, Jean-Charles, explains, \\"At nine-thirty we start cooking until midday, when we open. We don't have any storage fridges, so everything has to be eaten that day. We normally sell everything, which often means that we sell out by 2.30.\\"<br /><br />This oversized hard cover cookbook is equally fresh. There are full-page photographs of the bakery's butchers and apple suppliers and even a regular customer, who looks to be one very happy nine-year-old schoolgirl. To flip through the book is, I suspect, very much like a visit to the Bakery.<br /><br />The recipes? Traditional. And that's the point. Rose is big on breakfast --- \\"my favorite meal\\" --- so she starts with recipes for fruit salad, rhubarb and orange, scones, muesli and pancakes (classic or with ricotta). Lunch starts with soup (green bean and almond, spiced chickpea and lemon, celeriac and porcini), moves through salads and tarts and risotto, and closes with just a few animal-based entrees, like braised lamb shanks with cumin, eggplant and chickpeas. And then it's on to cakes and pastries, the stuff of afternoon tea.<br /><br />There's nothing here that's esoteric. The hardest part of duplicating these recipes is in the shopping --- finding organic produce that can stand up to simple preparation.oday's leftovers will never be tomorrow's special.

159448385X|4.0|I got this as a gift and had no idea what to expect. What could possibly interest me in a story about women in Afghanistan, I wondered. It started out a bit slow. I almost put it down. I'm really glad I didn't.    By halfway through, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.    If the last sentence does not bring tears to your eyes, you're made of stone. And I'm a guy.    I then read The Kite Runner, which is a fine novel. But Splendid Suns is a gem.
B000VUQ4HW|5.0|Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons. I mean, how could anybody actually enjoy a movie that could have been shot by a seventeen-year-old with a crappy camera? How naive I was...     Nosferatu is an exercise in brilliant film-making. Murnau's heavy investment on the look of the film pays off. The film is fun to watch. The acting is over the top, which is necessary to avoid constant cuts to dialog cards. The music is great, too. Chilling and expressive without being overbearing.

B00006JMQG|5.0|Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism. It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.     I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the \\"total work of art,\\" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.
0060899190|5.0|I love the post secret books.  I actually read these before taking a peek at the website.  My friend turned me on to post secret last year and convinced me to buy the books.  I'm glad I listened.  Some secrets are disturbing, but not offensive at all.  I definitely wouldn't let kids read the books, but I have passed them around to all my friends and most of my family.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Nosferatu should absolutely be respected for it's contribution to, and advancement of, the film industry and particularly horror movies. The film offers special effects that were cutting edge at the time and still maintain some of their power in creating terror and tension. I had reservations about watching Nosferatu. Since I love movies that make good use of sound, the idea of silent film didn't interest me. I had similar prejudices toward the special effects, cinematography, acting, etc. I figured Nosferatu was a classic for purely nostalgic reasons.

0440238153|3.0|The conclusion of every trilogy is often tinged with melancholy - not only due to what happens with beloved characters, but also in the knowledge that this is the end, and you have to say goodbye to hearing about their lives. And this third book in the His Dark Materials series is no exception! Despite the sadness, I love this conclusion and I am so happy that some pivotal plot threads were decisively ended (like Pan's arc as a character). This is not a \\"feel-good\\" ending, but it isn't devoid of happiness either. If Pullman ever decides to extend this trilogy, I definitely would be curious to see what happens to these characters.<br /><br />And as for the religious controversy that this trilogy sparked, this third volume is definitely the \\"preachiest\\" of the three. And it was the first one that I felt like this underlying message detracted from the overall story. Despite this, the book was still exciting to read. All in all, I think Pullman's books are not completely appropriate for the younger children in the YA market, but they are certainly entertaining for teens and adults as well.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This is by far the best Bluray I have purchased to date.  I took advantage of the Amazon credit card 30 bucks off your first purchase with this disc.  After actually watching this in all its glory, it's definitley worth paying full price.  This Bluray will leave you with your mouth wide open with jaw dropping material.  Couple of my faves are the Jungles with the crazy Birds of Paradise and the Caves with the creepy silk worms.  All in all this is a 10+ Bluray.  Must have for anyone with a Bluray player!  If you ever want to show someone who has never experienced Bluray before, this is the disc to pop in your player.
0743496736|5.0|I love her books. I know they're terribly Lifetime-movie-esque, but I just love them. Utterly emotional, impossible to put down. You care about all of the characters - and there is always a twist at the end. This one was no different. I don't tend to loan her books out - I like to keep them for myself, though it is rather selfish. I own all of her books and just as soon as I finish this one, I am anxious for the next (which I think will be out in hardcover in just under a month). And though I waited for this one to be out in paperback, I don't think this next one will be one I wait for. And though I have a stack of books that I haven't read for the first time yet, I think I may have to play book-Jenga in my closet so I can re-read all of her books. After all, I should know which one is my favorite, right?
0307341550|5.0|What a perfect book for Halloween! I curled up with this book on All Hallow's Eve and read it in one sitting. It was surprisingly suspenseful and absolutely thrilling - and the very last twist at the end was something I did not see coming at all. It was a very real shock, and made for a completely enjoyable read. The tone and level of tension really turned my Halloween into a wonderfully eerie one. I just loved this book. The narration worked so well and I just really liked the narrator and all of her odd quirks. Despite the dark nature of the book, I just loved the idea of these words carved into this woman's body. That and other psychological issues were handled very well, and in a very credible fashion. An excellent debut novel and I definitely plan on keeping an eye out for all of this Chicago author's future books. Bravo!

0525951113|5.0|I'm a techie, and this book was nearly impossible to put down...  Daemon by Daniel Suarez.  I was lucky in that I started it as I boarded a plane for a cross-country flight.  If this had been Suarez's fourth or fifth novel, I would have enjoyed it quite a bit.  Knowing it's his first makes it even better...<br /><br />Matthew Sobol, a genius who made a fortune in the computer gaming industry, dies from brain cancer at the age of 34.  At nearly the same time he dies, two programmers who work for his company, CyberStorm Entertainment, meet a rather gruesome end to their lives.  The homicide investigation reveals that the two deaths were \\"ordered\\" via an internet hack, and that serious preparation had been made to pull off the two murders.  But when they finally determine who likely killed them, they face a dilemma...  You can't prosecute a dead man for murder.  Sobol appeared to have left software agents, or \\"daemons\\", running on the net to trigger actions based on news feeds or particular events culled from RSS.  Of course, the 'net is a huge entity, and it's impossible to tell where other attacks might come from, or even if there are any more.  But there definitely *are* more to come, and it's only getting worse.  Sobel's daemons are enlisting the assistance of \\"wetware\\", and soon Sobol's \\"entity\\" has the ability to inflict rewards or harm on just about any element of society that it chooses.  This new \\"game\\" has life-and-death stakes, and it's up to the authorities to figure out if there's even a way to beat it...<br /><br />I imagine that anyone with an interest in tech will immediately be drawn into this novel by about the third chapter.  Then as the gaming element kicks in, it brings a whole new slant to your daily existence.  One of the review quotes on the back cover reference The Matrix, and I can see (and appreciate) the comparison.  Suarez does an excellent job blending science fiction and gaming strategy into a compelling read that shows just how much of what we are is based on technology.  If I could have a steady supply of this type of sci-fi storytelling, I'd be a happy man.sed on technology.  If I could have a steady supply of this type of sci-fi storytelling, I'd be a happy man.
0131103628|1.0|All due respect to Mr. Ritchie (he created the C language), this is a VERY poorly written book. Before you experienced programmers hurl your keyboards at me, hear me out: when you study CS at university, one of the first classes you take is C/C++ programming. What does this mean? It means that C is what you would call a \\"gateway\\" programming language. That is, it's for BEGINNERS. Very few people studying C have prior experience in programming; therefore, writing a C book for \\"experienced programmers\\" is like putting Latin phrases in a children's book. Most people who are studying C are just getting their feet wet in programming, and they take the fundamentals that they learn with C and move on to other programming languages.    This book is written in the most cryptic, undecipherable manner possible. It's as if the authors are more preoccupied with showing off their vocabulary than they are with showing you how to use C. I know at the time of the book's initial release, C was being used by programmers who likely studied Fortran or Pascal prior, but things have changed. Knowing that C often the first step in beginning to learn CS, the authors should have revised this book to make it easier for beginners to understand.    Sorry to insult your \\"Bible\\", computer guys, but potential buyers should know that there are much, MUCH better books out there for you to learn C (try Absolute Beginner's Guide to C, by Greg Perry). My grade: return (0);

1595141715|1.0|This book is in middle school libraries and is popular especially among girls.  My 8th-grader likes mysteries and wanted to read it. Parents should skim through this since it deals with bullying, mocking, poor self image, sex, witnessing rape and being raped -- all in flashbacks explaining why the main character commits suicide.  These are very heavy topics (especially when combined) for this age group.  The idea of making teens aware of how their words and actions can wear on a person's psyche is a good one; however, there's obviously something deeper here that is missing from the story.  The parents of the main character who commits suicide are completely absent from the plot. I would love to see reviews from readers in the mental health profession. In the end, I advised my 8th grader that there are better mysteries out there and to wait a couple of years to read this one.
0810979772|5.0|I am so thrilled that my 8 year old boy FINALLY has found something that he loves to read.

0312944926|4.0|For decades, the U.S. government has had the ability to encrypt and decrypt email messages. But now, a man claims he has rewritten the book on cryptography and can make messages perfectly undecipherable. At what lengths will the United States government go to keep the lid on him?<br /><br />When all of the controversy started popping up surrounding \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" I tried to shy away from Dan Brown books. It was nothing personal; it's just that the majority of time when there's a ridiculous amount of bad publicity concerning a novel, it's not usually because it's amazingly well-written.<br /><br />Then the movie came out, and I read many of the book's reviews on Amazon. People seemed to trash Brown's writing style more than the controversy surrounding Jesus. I saw the movie, thought it was OK and proceeded on with the rest of my life.<br /><br />My stepmom recommended I read the fiction novel \\"Digital Fortress,\\" so I thought this would be a good introduction to Dan Brown. After all, it was somewhat unfair for me to consider him a poor writer if I never read anything he wrote. She said the book reminded her of \\"The Developers\\" in certain ways, more from a technological standpoint.<br /><br />I have to admit, I was a bit surprised about how much I liked \\"Digital Fortress,\\" and how much I enjoy Brown's writing style. It's succinct and not overly wordy. At the same time, he is able to get the point across and paint a picture of what is going on throughout the story.<br /><br />The story itself is not bogged down in computer technology, although there are some passages that may require re-reads from a non-computer-savvy person. All in all, the book is an exciting and fast-paced adventure that canvasses not only the computer world, but a world of deception and governmental power.

0143036556|5.0|Is civilization, as we know it today, invincible? Considering human existence since the beginning, it's a tough call to say how long we'll survive. On the other hand, it is feasible to review past societies to compare and contrast them to today's world.<br /><br />To classify Jared Diamond's latest work, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed,\\" as just a book about the changing environment would be short-sighted. Diamond's focus is planet destruction, which ranges from damage to land and damage to life in general.<br /><br />The author starts with a five-point framework to differentiate between the different types of destruction: people inadvertently inflicting damage on their environment; climate change; hostile neighbors; decreased support of friendly neighbors; and finally, a society's responses to the aforementioned problems.<br /><br />The societies in question within \\"Collaspe\\" vary by both physical and historical location. Easter Island, the Anasazi, the Maya and Viking groups highlight the past societies portion, while Rwanda, Haiti, China and Australia are featured in the modern section.<br /><br />I don't think this book is suited for a special subset of individuals. It's for every individual who is interested in seeing cultures continue to thrive and work around solutions for problems. It's a perfect blend of history, politics and science, all of which inevitably make up the world surrounding us.<br /><br />Diamond doesn't subscribe to the theory that we're headed for doom; in fact, he classifies his opinion as \\"reserved optimism.\\" Fortunately, there are a multitude of advances that will help achieve a balance of life on earth. \\"Collapse\\" is about learning from past mistakes and preventing them from happening again. Assuming we can continue to make strides in a positive way, maybe we won't have to inflate our lifejackets.

It took me a week and a half to complete a 20 minute workout from beginning to end but it feels great to know I am getting stronger.

This is hard, but if you stick with it, even if you can't finish the routine, you will find yourself in much better shape. Also check out Jillian's Cardio Kick Box. I gave four stars because you can't fast forward the intro but I now start the video and use the extra couple of minute to warm up and get some water, you will need it.
0765342294|5.0|Sometimes books are labeled fairly in a certain genre, although they may appear to people who do not normally enjoy the given category. \\"Ender's Game,\\" by Orson Scott Card, has to be categorized as a science-fiction novel. But luckily for the reader, it's much more than that.<br /><br />True, one of Card's central influences was Isaac Asimov, a well-known sci-fi writer. And while Card does wonderful work on the space and technology side of this book, he pays close attention to the numerous psychological aspects of humanity.<br /><br />Ender is the name of a child who some high-level officials believe will command worldly forces against an alien race, or the \\"buggers.\\" Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are extremely intelligent and have leadership qualities, but are secondary compared to Ender. That's the reason Ender is jettisoned to Battle School in space, where he befriends some of the students. At the same time, though, Ender and nearly everyone else is aware that he is gifted, which leads to numerous issues amongst the children.<br /><br />As Ender continues to climb the military ladder, his brother and sister begin a quest of their own on earth. Valentine, the sister, is torn between helping Peter, whom she perceives as being the evil brother, and Ender, whom she dearly misses.<br /><br />From a futuristic standpoint, this book nails many of the theories involving humanistic thinking and how to lead through the usage of highly intelligent reasoning. Regardless of technological advances, there are certain aspects of mankind that remain pretty much the same, namely the basic foundation of reason. This book would be a hit not only for anyone interested in science fiction, but also those interested in politics, psychology and philosophy.
0312330529|5.0|'IT TOOK ME a long time and most of the world to learn what I know about love and fate and the choices we make, but the heart of it came to me in an instant, while I was chained to a wall and being tortured.'<br /><br />And so begins Shantaram, an epic novel and one of the best written pieces of work I have ever had the pleasure to read.<br /><br />I won't synopsize.  I will just say that the story is incredible, and mostly true I understand.  The characters leap off the page and grab your heart.  From Prabaker, the sweet man who befriends Lin and becomes his guide, to the Standing Baba's that open chapter 8, you are invested.  In this story and in these people, all of us live.  We all know Karla, the woman a man can easily fall for and never get to know.  She is hauntingly exquisite.  The scenes the author paints, from sliding in and out of consciousness (in an opium den, or in a prison), to the scenery (whether in Afghanistan, or in a crowded slum) place you right there, and the journey you take with Roberts is exhilarating.<br /><br />It is a long read, and had it been published here in this country it would be half as long.  We'd be half as blessed.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|For those who missed the streaming last summer, now is you chance to witness one of Joss Whedon's best works.  The show's unique concept of a supervillain musical makes it an instant clasic (in a quirky kind of way).  The real reason to buy the DVD, rather than downloading them off iTunes, is the amazing special features.  My favorite is the audition tapes for the Evil League of Evil, but Commentary! the Musical is amusing as well.  There's far more here then just a miniseries.

015206396X|2.0|Warning a few hints if not spoilers.    I love the concept of having powers seen in the book, but the morals were much to be desired and the characters behaviors and the way the responded to situations felt inconsistent at times.  I understand why teens would like this book because of the cool powers and the way the author describes those powers and I myself really liked this book up until the main character flippantly gives herself away, like there are no consequences to her actions.  It is amazing how giving ones self to another person is the easy way out in society now.  I was able to get over this dislike until the end.  The ending just felt like the author did not know how to conclude all that had happened.  For me it felt like the rolls between characters had reversed in who wanted to settle down and who didn't.  Plus the characters weren't even going to be with each other for extensive periods of time from then on out; now that is a way to keep a relationship going!
B001KMB6X2|1.0|This was one god-awful festering terd of a movie. It was a total waste of my time and money. It was not only uninteresting, it made no sense either. Vin Diesel is washed up if this is the best he can do. My advice is to skip it.
B000H7JD4A|3.0|There are only 2 songs on this worth downloading, and keeping. Those are Different World, and The Longest Day. The 2nd of the 2 actually had me excited, and banging my head. The rest are all gallops, and up down up down arabian vocal & guitar patterns. Seriously, many of these sound like covers of previous songs with new words. Most of the lyrics are uninspiring. The album does rock, but to find it fresh, you have to forget about everything they've already done before. If I was to produce a new Iron Maiden record, I'd tell them to imitate some other classic stuff like Ozzy for awhile, and see what it sounds like. The gallops of this horse are getting old & weak.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Displaying their trademark studio mastery and epic length, progressive metal's most successful act seemed to nonetheless be headed to a complete creative standstill with their latest release. Like a logical extension from Lateralus, itself an extension from what was perhaps their only true evolutionary leap (Aenima), 10,000 days continues to either channel the compositional phrasings of past glories or meander down more insignificant bloat in the name of \\"experimentation\\", though few bands as influential and once innovative display the lack of exploring outside their predefined parameters more prominently.

B00000IQC8|3.0|\\"Dogma\\" made me do it.<br /><br />After watching that crazy/sincere and original movie, I wanted to see what else director Kevin Smith had made. \\"Clerks,\\" his first film, made on the cheap, is roughly shot in black on white. It is over-written and horribly acted. But there is something fascinating and real about the film. \\"Clerks\\" is set almost exclusively inside a North Jersey mini-market and next door video store. Writer Kevin Smith seems to have thrown every gross conversation idea he had into the film. It vibrates with the familiar (and pathetic) issues of the post-high-school-pre-marriage school crowd, living away from home and letting loose on each other to try to arrange their private lives. Main character Dante Hicks is a 24-year-old store clerk. He and and current floozy girlfriend Caitlin are on fairly good terms until the conversation turns to the number of other lovers each has had. Meanwhile, Dante pines for old flame Veronica, whose engagement notice just appeared in the paper. Slacker friend Randal clerks the (mostly customer-free) video store next door until he gets bored and pops into the markeet to annoy Dante and insult his customers. There are rooftop street hockey games, a fiaso in a funeral parlor, a list of porn titles raw enough to curdle sewage, a renewed romance and a dead guy in a bathroom. Just another day at the mini-mart.<br /><br />\\"Clerks\\" is foul-mouthed, disgusting, yet over-the-top fascinating. The cast of slackers, losers, half-wits and yokels has potential, not always actualized. Smith's classic duo -- the ever-enigmatic Silent Bob and a particularly potty-mouthed Jay -- make their debut. With \\"Clerks,\\" Smith shows that he has an eye for character and the absurdity of normal life. A plot twist involving a dead girl and a casket is well done, thouh all the action takes place off screen.<br /><br />\\"Clerks\\" is not a family film or even a date film by any stretch of the imagination. My wife was not impressed, not say the least. And one piece of writing will leave a really bad taste in your mouth. But the film is a fine document of one filmmaker's starting point in the business. A special stop for any Kevin Smith fan.ill leave a really bad taste in your mouth. But the film is a fine document of one filmmaker's starting point in the business.

0307455874|4.0|This book was written back in 2006, before Barack Obama ever thought about making a run for the White House.  But if you take the time to read it - REALLY read it - you'll see that it reflects what he's been saying during and after the campaign.  It's only been three years but his views and philosophy don't seem to have changed that much.  And that speaks volumes for what we can look forward to in the next four (hopefully eight) years.<br /><br />Obama is very plain-spoken here.  He doesn't use sophisticated political language; he speaks an English that the average American should be able to understand, and outlines a philosophy and point of view that, while you may not agree with it, is perfectly understandable.<br /><br />There isn't much biography here - that was in his earlier book, \\"Dreams From my Father\\", which is on my shelves waiting for me to read it.  But there is enough to whet your appetite for that earlier book, including one very funny sequence concerning ants.  I'm not going to spoil it; you'll have to read it yourself.

Only when you GET the book do you realize that it is small - in size and in length!  It isn't a large, epic book like you see Carrie with at all.  Not at all.  This book is 144 pages, large type with a LOT of white space.      The book is also totally commercialized.  The first few lines of the text on the jacket mention Carrie, Big and Sex and the City.  I went to find such a book after seeing it in the movie, yes, but didn't want one with that splashed all over it.  Tacky.    And finally, they tout that there was no book like the one in the movie before this one.  Well, that just isn't true.  If you do a search for such books (here on Amazon), you will find several that match very closely and are certainly the same concept.      I will sell this one and go buy one of those.  This one wasn't worth the money or shelf space.      Don't bother.  Do a quick search and get a real book.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out and the more I listen, the more I love it.  The songs are haunting and emotional with beautiful melodies.  My favorites are \\"The Day Before the Day\\", \\"Look No Further\\" and \\"Don't Believe in Love\\" but I can honestly say that I like all the tracks on this CD.  Some are lighter, happier tunes and others seem very introspective and sad.  I've been a Dido fan since her first CD and \\"Safe Trip Home\\" has only reinforced my feeling that she is one of the more talented singers out there today.

B00005JPS8|5.0|\\"Iron Man\\" is one of the best action movies I have seen in quite some time. Not a graphic novel reader, I was unaware of the plot until I saw the movie. The writing, acting and production work all came together and produced a wonderfully entertaining escape for fiction lovers like myself. I would even recommend this movie to those who do not usually watch science fiction or fantasy action films. Well done.
0618918248|5.0|I like reading books where you feel a little smarter when you're done.  I'm only 1/4 through this book and I've already learned many new things.  Just a couple are \\"There's no such thing as a religious child.  They can't comprehend religions and deities and it's forced onto them by their parents\\" and \\"Just because something can't be explained doesn't mean that God it.  Some things just can't be explained.\\"    If you're thinking of taking the final step to atheism, read this.  If not, don't bother.

B0017I1FNK|5.0|I have long been an Emmylou Harris fan. Her voice is proof that a well-seasoned voice is so much smoother than the screeches one can hear on American Idol. Want to experience a true American idol? Get this CD. I love the way she takes other musician's songs and makes them so uniquley hers. Having grown up in California, and having spent summers on the Kern, for me her rendition of Merle Haggard's \\"Kern River\\" is a close-your-eyes and float gently down a beautiful memory of summers gone past. And, yes, I know that the song is all about heartbreak, but that's the joy of Emmylou's voice - she melds us together in shared emotions of life. Here's to many more years of hearing her voice...
6304698690|2.0|After reading the reviews I was hopeful, but my son and I watched this after he finished reading (and loved) the book and were quite disappointed. Significant differences include: how the parents die, Medlock's character (added \\"drama\\" - including job resignation - to her role), HOW SARAH FINDS THE KEY!!, added \\"romance\\" between Sarah and both boys that is unnecessary and not in the book, a nighttime fire scene, HOW COLIN MEETS HIS FATHER, added Sarah \\"drama\\" (\\"No one wants me!\\") at the end that was wholly unnecessary. The movie is beautiful to watch, but if you have read the book the differences are really disappointing and completely unnecessary.

B001O4FXY4|5.0|Like the first reviewer stated Derek Trucks plays understandably on this album. Regardless Derek for his age and his history he an awesome performer/song writer. I have never seen his band live before. I missed him at Bonnaroo 2008 although I attended it. This album is good for him although this is the first true album of DTB that I have listened to. His voice is of a different world. I did see him play in Piedmont Park ATL, GA in Sept of 07 with The Allman Brothers Band as he is a current member with them as well. His talent and also his bands talents are awesome. This cd is up lifting kind of brings your soul up music if you listen to the words and flow. But this is my first album purchase of his.
B00127RAJY|5.0|My New Year's resolution was like most, to get in shape. I've never tried any type of workout DVD before but watch Biggest Loser all the time.

The first couple of workouts made me so sore I could barely walk up and down the stairs to our apartment. I am so excited to see the results. If you are like me and need to lose some weight and want to have fun, get this DVD!
0307387178|1.0|This book angered me to no end. I just could not wrap my head around the absolute sociopathic selfishness displayed by Chris McCandless. We should not label him as an admirable hero. He is a whiny middle class white male who is given every opportunity to change the world, which he claims to want to do. Instead of utilizing this opportunity he squanders it to challenge the authority of his parents. It seems to me that wanted people to talk about his adventure, about how courageous he 'seemed' . . . Otherwise he wouldn't have left a paper trail.
B000W92AS4|3.0|This is not the remake from 1939, but the original version from 1936 as advertised. This 1936 version, directed by the co-author Gustaf Molander,  stars Ingrid Bergman as Anita Hoffman, and Gösta Ekman as Holger Brant. The film was remade by director Gregory Ratoff and titled \\"Intermezzo: A Love Story\\". It was based on the same script written by Gustaf Molander, also starred Ingrid Bergman as Anita Hoffman, but this time cast Leslie Howard as Holger Brant.

B001BJ65SU|5.0|This review is for the Mobile Fidelity Sound Labs remastered CD.<br /><br />I have several versions of this CD and this version is BY FAR the best.  MFSL somehow got their hands on the mono version of this album and made one of the best sounding CDs in my collection.<br /><br />While many people are saying to themselves \\"Mono?  Are you serious?\\"  My answer is \\"YES\\"!  Back in the days when this album was recorded, Capital Records simply mastered the technique of capturing a mono recording.  However, stereo was an afterthought.  The studio spent much more time with the mono recording and in this case, the album is better in that format.<br /><br />I know $30 is a ridiculous amount to pay for a CD.  However, this is one of the greatest albums in Sinatra's career and this is the best digital version of the album.  If you are a fan of this classic album (if you aren't, you should be) you owe it to yourself to buy this version.

B000002UAX|4.0|The Beatle's \\"White Album\\" has a number of dubious distinctions:<br /><br />1. It was the Beatle's only double album.<br />2. It's one of the few albums where listeners refer to it's color and nickname \\"The White Album\\" and not it's real name \\"The Beatles.\\"<br />3. It was in some ways, the beginning of the end for the Fab Four as many tracks on the album were recorded individually without the other Beatles in attendance.<br />4. It will forever be linked with a dark place in history as an influence on Charles Manson and the cult murders that took place in 1969.<br /><br />Having said this, there's a lot of great music on the two sides but I'm going to start with the songs I don't like.  Perhaps my most disliked Beatles song ever, \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" (why Paul?) is on here and \\"Revolution 9\\" by John shouldn't be labeled as a song, it's more like an endless loop.  I'm also not a huge fan of \\"Don't Pass Me By,\\" \\"Honey Pie,\\" or \\"Wild Honey Pie.\\"<br /><br />On the positive side, \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is not only perhaps George's finest song ever, but this may be one of rock's greatest songs ever.  I also love the acoustic version which you can find on Beatle's Anthology.  John's \\"Julia\\" is a beautiful ballad about his mother and although he personally may not have liked \\"Cry Baby Cry,\\" it's one of my favorites on the album. I also like \\"Long,Long,Long\\" and \\"Good Night.\\" Of course, there's Paul's \\"Helter Skelter\\" and \\"Back In The USSR\\" which are good songs, too, as well as a few other good ones. While I can't say this is my favorite Beatle's album, it has certainly held up well over 40 years.

067182449X|5.0|The Diary of Anne Frank is a very interesting book. What I liked about it is how she has so much personality in her diary. The whole time I was reading it, I was thinking to myself, \\"Was this book edited? It sounds so god! A 14 or 15 year old girl could not have written this!\\" It was like she meant it to be a book all along. Her life was so complicated. Way too complicated then a 14/ 15-year-old's life should be. She dealt with it all very well though. Anne Frank was a very smart girl. She was so different from the rest of her family, and they didn't get that. She deserved to have been treated better. If only her family read her diary. If they read that diary, then everyone would have been so much appreciative of her. No one actually knew what types of things she went through. There was more to Anne Frank than what met the eye. Thanks to her diary we all know the real Anne Frank!<br />-Ashlyn Roberts

B000HC2LI0|5.0|The West Wing is one of the few shows I can think of that won a ton of Emmys - and deserved them. It all starts with brilliant writing (informed, interesting, dramatic, and humorous, often at the same time), but throw in an incredible cast, set design, directing, and on and on. It all adds up to one of the greatest television series of all time.<br /><br />The boxed set contains the complete series as well as numerous bonus features. The box is nice, but I don't like the way the dvd discs are arranged within it. Though the folders look cool and allow all the dvds to be contained in a relatively small amount of space, the discs have to be slid in and out of their holders, which puts them at risk of being scratched. (Much preferable would have been an arrangement like you'd see in the season sets of Homicide: Life on the Street and Battlestar Galactica, in which each disc has its own thin case that it can click into.)<br /><br />Despite that quibble, everything else about this set is all you can hope for in a series. Every season was excellent, even if the post-Sorkin years weren't quite on the level of the earlier seasons (though I do think the show finished with a strong final season). It's a rare thing to find a program of this quality, and I couldn't recommend The West Wing more highly.
0446402389|1.0|Certainly this writer has a nice style.  I liked the first 2/3 of the book.  But a detective thriller has to have a satisfying resolution--this who done it, doesn't.

B000ESST6U|5.0|This is an extraordinarily compelling production--staggeringly beautiful, meticulously stylized, and prodigiously creative.    Baroque opera is exquisitely aestheticized and extravagantly theatrical. Its road to emotional truth is thickly coded. Abstraction and excess are its very media. The staging has to take the same road. Out go naturalistic movement and direct expression. In come hyperbolic gestures and hallucinating visuals. This is the road taken here, and it matches the epoch to a tee. It captures the visual language of the Baroque without overt references to the era.    Sarah Connolly is stunning as Caesar. The charisma is palpable, the masculine charge undeniable, the grasp of power arresting. `Va tacito' offers the kind of glimpse into the choreography of power that Leni Reifenstahl would stage. Several of the other performers are equally superb in their roles, but Connolly I watched almost in disbelief--so persuasive is she.    And yet Handel is not only spectacular; he is also poignant and reflective. Giulio Cesare is a precious work of art. Although the music is exuberantly ornamented, the emotional impact is ultimately simple and direct. The meditative, soaring moments are where the director blinks at times. He piles dancing, light show, and elaborate costumes on music that needs no help from Hollywood. `V'adoro pupille' is one such instance. It is an aria that stops time--a fragile, liquid moment. As luminous as it looks in this production, I wish that McVicar had resisted the bourgeois impulse to manage it, to improve on it, to produce something out of it. I wish he had let it be. While entertainment is not a dirty word, as McVicar points out, it is not nearly as pleasurable as great art.     As a whole, this production is nonetheless remarkably effective. It tempts you to wallow in the pleasures of power--and it prompts you to catch yourself doing it.

B0000AK7AA|5.0|Casper is a character that has existed in our minds and our hearts for over 70 years in comic strips and cartoons. Finally, in the year 1995 we are treated to our first live action incarnation of this fantastic character. With the help of Christina Ricci and some exceptionally sweet voice acting by Malachi Pearson we are given a highly enjoyable, highly loveable family picture that teaches us an important message of friendship, family and most important of all moving on while still holding onto the memories of the loved ones we have lost.<br /><br />The story focuses around despicable idiots Carrigan (Cathy Moriarty) and Dibbs (Eric Idle) and their quest to find the treasure hidden in a rundown old mansion left to Carrigan in her fathers will. The biggest problem facing Carrigan and Dibbs about Whipstaff Manor are the ghosts that inhabit it. Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch are 3 of the 4 ghosts that inhabit the manor and they're not too pleasant to be encountered by. Casper is the 4th ghost and isn't like the other 3, he just wants a friend to play with so he uses Carrigans plan to have ghost psychiatrist James Harvey (Pullman) and his daughter Kat (Ricci) move in.<br /><br />Ricci was about 15 at the time of the making of this and although it wasn't an Oscar winning role, she certainly played the part of the disgruntled teenager well. The character of Casper was exceptionally sweet and not in an overbearing or sickening way as is the case with most movies based around the sweet characters. Luckily that sweetness is covered a lot for the cynical members of society thanks to the obnoxious uncles Fatso, Stinkie and Stretch and the criminal idiocy of Carrigan and Dibbs.<br /><br />This is a film packed with childish clich&eacute;s we have all come to know and love, such as the basics of courtesy and friendship. The usual slapstick humour we come to expect is also there and is helped by the characteristics of the ghostly uncles, Fatso in particular. Although that character may not be very PC today, there's no doubting that at the time the character was simply put in place to be the threatening big character who turned out to be quite laughable. The interractions between Casper and Kat are sometimes flawless and on a personality level is actually quite heart wearming. Some of the interractions thanks to the believable acting of Ricci make you think that she is really talking to a large headed ghost, and he is really making them breakfast.<br /><br />Talking of interractions, the CGI is something to really shout about as for the time this film was made CGI specialised such as this had never been seen before. The interractions between the CG animated ghost and reality are flawless to say the least. Food interraction, communication between the actors and the ghost characters and other general interractions between CGI and reality are truly without flaw.<br /><br />Casper is an enjoyable character and the whole message of passing over in regards to the ghosts is very special indeed. I highly applaud this film for managing to competently put across what some people would consider a sickeningly sweet storyline, and making it an enjoyable experience for the entire family to thoroughly enjoy. One particular part of the film which I loved was the cameo of Clint Eastwood, Mel Gibson and Rodney Dangerfield.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this film and its sequels, although I haven't seen the sequels myself but I'm sure they would be good.'s no doubting that at the time the character was simply put in place to be the threatening big character who turned out to be quite laughable.

0143037757|2.0|In Postwar Judt has undertaken an immense task and has completed it fitfully.In certain details he has not checked whether his figures tally. At page 18 he says that the number of non-combatant civilians amongst the dead in the War was at least 19 millions (excluding Japanese, U.S.or other non-European dead).He goes on to say that the civilian dead on the territory of the Soviet Union was likely to be in excess of 16 millions.Then he gives the civilian deaths as 5 millions in Poland, 1.4 millions in Yugoslavia etc. All that, excluding the civilian deaths in Germany, comes to over 24 millions. The figure 19 millions given as above is far short of the total excluding Germany. Which is correct?  Another matter of cotroversy. At p19 Judt says that the Soviets took 3.5 million  Prisoners of war and \\"Most of them returned home after the war\\". S.W.Mitchum in \\"The Men of the Luftwafe\\" says that Hitler rejected the idea of capitulation at Stalingrad, saying that no prisoners will survive Soviet captivity and \\"he was almost right on this point. Only about 7000 of the 90,000 men who surrendered at Stalingrad ever lived to see home again\\" Who is right, Judt or Mitchum?  Even in editing there are mistakes. At p 298 it is said, \\"It was on Britain the impact of the Suez miscalculation was felt most acutely\\". 'on' instead of 'in'!!  And in the foot-note at p595, \\"But the new Soviet leader did not even acknowledged the fact till November 1990\\". Commendable grammer!!  Although Judt deals with the French withdrawals from Indo-China and Algeria and with the Suez crisis in considerable detail, his treatment of the British dismantling  of its Indian Empire is cursory.Judt should have dealt with this part of British history in depth. Why did Britain withdraw from India despite Churchill's defiant declaration that the \\"Atlantic Charter' did not apply to Britih colonies. Was it because,  a)having  had to revoke at U.S.insistence and in return for American assistance in the war, the principle of Imperial preference adopted at Ottawa, Britain found that political control of India did not lead to any commercial advantage vis-a-vis other industrialized nations eager to trade with India, or  b)the Empire was 'no longer turning a profit, not even pay its way' or      c) the war showed that colonial possessions were envied by other European powers and led to conflict and heavy loss of lives,  or  d) a realizatin that colonising other people was no better than enslaving them and was, therefore, morally wrong  or  d) Gandhiji's 'Quit India' movement showed that the whole of India was becoming restive and eager for independence and it would require heavy  and costly miltary presence to keep it under control.  Judt should have examined these questions in depth.  At page 293, Judt makes it seem that the 1931 Statue of Westminister applied to British Colonies. It did not: it applied to white Dominions like, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa.  Because of such shortcomings 'Postwar' becomes a book of questinable authority.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Vampire Weekend in no way describes the music on this album. You might think this New England band would be all goth or punk, with deep depressing lyrics, but not so. This band is more like a preppy college pep rally sans the guitars that Weezer has.<br /><br />In some ways the band shares similarities to some of my other favorite bands. For example, \\"Mansard Roof\\" is similar to the Talking Heads' \\"Thank You For Sending Me An Angel\\" from their 1978 \\"More Songs About Buildings And Food\\" album. Or \\"A-Punk\\" sounds similar to The English Beat's \\"Mirror In The Bathroom\\" from their 1980 \\"I Just Can't Stop It\\" album. Or \\"Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa\\" sounds similar to Paul Simon's \\"Diamonds On The Soles Of Her Shoes\\" from his 1986 \\"Graceland\\" album. Sometimes Ezra Koenig's singing reminds me of Adam Ant as well. They are all of these things, and yet they are none. They bring something new and refreshing to the table.<br /><br />The non sequitur lyrics such as \\"Know your butler, unlike other guys\\". Or, \\"I see salty message written in the eaves\\". Or, \\"As a young girl, Louis Vuitton, with your mother, on a sandy lawn\\". Or even, \\"Pollination Yellow Cab\\". What's it all mean?! Doesn't matter because it's meta-communication. It means whatever you want it to mean. Clever, because how many young bands are this intellectually stimulating, or not stimulating at all? The music, the melodies, this is what you will remember, along with the quirky lyric or three.<br /><br />Vampire Weekend are off to a great start, and it will be interesting to see where these guys go with their music assuming they all give up their day jobs! Four stars for their debut, leaving room for them to grow and produce a five star album in the future.
B000006OAM|5.0|Normally I only listen to pre 80s music since much of mainstream pop was taken over by photogenic video artists who were average or at worst, could barely carry a tune.  It's nice to hear a modern artist who takes care of the lyrics and arrangements.  The use of different instruments enhances her soulful vocals.  I'm tired of dancing electronically enhanced pop stars and it makes me feel optimistic that a talented artist can still rise to the top.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|In the excitement of Metallica's return there has been much amplified talk about Death Magnetic. Enough amplified talk, in fact, that it would be easy to lose perspective. Anything you read that tells you DM is better than anything the band has done in 17 years is complete truth. It is easily their most interesting and accomplished release in that time.  Its also about half as good as anything they released prior to those 17 years.<br /><br />Lets call a spade a spade. James (God love him) is a redneck, yet in the 80's he found himself playing pseudo-classical music on electric guitar. All the Wagnerian grandeur and Bolero-like crescendos, the staccato arrangements piled a mile high were great fun. They got the band respect and Metallica were as important to hard music in the 80s as Led Zeppelin was the decade before. However, what Metallica really loved was to drink, and whisky, not Cab or Merlot.  More, all these frouphy classical leanings were cramping James' style, leaving him without an avenue to exorcise is Skynyrd-lovin', boogie-woogie self.<br /><br />So after the Black album and the world-dominating tour that followed, Metallica return to the studio having willed themselves well more creative license than was good for them. One must agree the Load albums expressed who the band was, and had always been, better than their classic material, in that it took into account their redneck roots instead of only the classical ones they had instead inherited from metal heros Judus Priest and Mercyful Fate. However, the problem was the songs simply weren't very good. The best of them, opening single \\"Until It Sleeps\\", even reaked of creative strain, James clawing for his life through a wall of writer's block.  That song today sounds like a forced attempt to recreate Enter Sandman that pales by comparison. St. Anger, similar to Iron Maiden's Virtual XI, is better ignored in hopes it will be forgotten.<br /><br />The accomplishment of Death Magnetic is that for the first time in 4 attempts (and those aforementioned 17 years) the band successfully marries their two periods together. The stack'o'tracks rifforama of their heyday is represented even if several transitions are more clumsy than they ever were in the 80s. And also, the gasoline fueled, whisky lovin' aesthetic the band wanted for Load and Reload has better material and therefore a better chance to sell you the idea was a good one in the first place. Death Magnetic's nostalgia though isn't all good as no Metallica record has generated more complaints about production since you couldn't hear Jason's bass on ...And Justice For All.<br /><br />I was never sold on the idea Metallica 'sold out'. They have had that spear tossed their way as many times as any artist of the past 20 years. They got old. The band tours more than Barnum & Bailey and, more than anything, they have sounded tired on Load, Reload, Anger and the EPs. As the unintentional hilarity of documentary, Some Kind of Monster, attests, they also became more than a little distracted.<br /><br />Part of every Metallica record is on Death Magnetic. Sometimes I even hear the raw spark that makes Kill 'Em All the classic it still is, especially on the first couple tracks. To be frank, I didn't think I would ever hear that again on a Metallica record and it is a joy to admit I have. On Death Magnetic Metallica's gears are working again like a classic car you pull out of your garage. And while you are first delighted with surprise it starts at all, and still with that smell that floods your senses with memory and the noise of the engine revving that, despite the rust, reminds you of the first time you felt its power, it also doesn't mean the car runs as it did when you were a teenager. It also doesn't necessarily have to. Perhaps the biggest advantage of being a artist who has already accomplished greatness is that even when you come close to it again, that difference that remains in our memory ends up being implied. DeathMagnetic is not Master of Puppets with Jack Daniels poured over it. It's difficult to hear this though without remembering that time.Jack Daniels poured over it. It's difficult to hear this though without remembering that time.

I won't repeat all the good points from previous reviews - but we really need more things like this to succeed, which bypass the Hollywood middlemen.  Even though it was available on the web as a free download, it seems worth supporting projects like this financially so people can make them without the content cartels getting their fingers in the pie and messing up the recipe.  Hollywood is afraid of this business model, but I want it to succeed - it puts creative control back in the hands of the people actually doing the work, and also gives them the rewards rather than having an endless series of middlemen glommed on to take their cut.    So support quirky and cool little projects like this.  Support independent musicians and artists.  Just say no to the RIAA.
B001HQZJP2|4.0|if u like humor and a little history to it.. this is what u need. All of this movie have alot of action and cool special affect.. everyone in my family enjoy this movie,, all of them too.. but blueray alway cost alot.. if the price was under $45 it would be a great buy
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|enya does it again, this is a beautiful Christmas CD.  Songs included are new and different, not the same holiday songs sung to a different tempo.  I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to anyone that enjoys enya's singing style.  [[ASIN:B001GQ2TGA And Winter Came]]
B001AXOFS4|5.0|I suggest you buy this. The live CD included is a lovely lovely collection. I'm enamored with Adele!
1400082773|5.0|This is a great book to read, beautifully written. Superb job by a soon to be superb President. Personally it allowed me to rediscover some similar upbringing I had and took me to gut wrenching places within my soul that I never thought I would have reached. Thank you for sharing Mr. President elect Barack Obama. May God continue to guide and protect the path of yours and your family.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. It was a fine balance between the Sparta's history, comedy, love, devotion and commitment. The director did a great job to put this together so it flows and keeps you at the edge of your seet and you eyes glued to the television. Amaizing piece of art.
B001CDLATE|4.0|Wow! That's about all I can say about BARAKA. What a moving 100 minute journey. This blu ray is of the highest quality and a must own for anyone with a blu ray player. For those without one, you need to go buy one right away for this movie alone. This should be required viewing for anyone who has a soul. Filmed in 24 countries and put only to a soundtrack without words, each indivisual viewer gets to take this visual journey and everyone will have a little bit different expierience. As we move from place to place throughout the film questions will arise in your mind and we will see some of the greatest wonders ever. I give this film one of my highest recomendations and you shall not regret it.
B001CTA1S4|4.0|Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is the priest of St. Nicholas parish in the Bronx in 1964. He smokes, drinks, takes sugar with his tea, preaches relevant sermons, and even thinks that a secular song would be good for the Christmas play. \\"The church must change,\\" he says. Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), the principal of the school, is Flynn's polar opposite. She's loveless, joyless, authoritarian, and thinks the worst of everyone -- especially of Father Flynn. So we're not surprised when she accuses him of an indiscretion with the school's first black student. When he strenuously objects, she responds, \\"I have no proof, I have my certainty.\\" Just when you thought the film traded on clumsy stereotypes, further layers of genuine complexity, ambiguity and \\"doubt\\" emerge. We the viewers are left with genuine doubt about what to think. Except for the last thirty seconds of the film, which I thought betrayed its character, Doubt contrasts religion that reduces virtue to moralism and that prioritizes human compassion as its greatest good.
B000002LIM|5.0|Tim Burton had successfully worked with Danny Elfman on the music for Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice. But those projects were like hitting a couple of home runs in a minor-league ballpark and then being asked to smack a grand slam out of Yankee Stadium when Burton pencilled Elfman into the starting lineup for this highly-anticipated film that was in the making for nearly a decade.<br /><br />And Elfman delivered in the clutch.<br /><br />The titles to the 21 tracks - clocking in at 54:45 - aptly depict the emotions that are conveyed by the music, which was arranged by Elfman, Steve Bartek and Shirley Walker and co-produced by Elfman and Bartek. The score is equally brooding and powerful, with the colors meticulously splashed on a  gothic canvas, and remains a gem in the iconic franchise for the Caped Crusader.
B001EZ1H6G|5.0|Made in EU in 2008, Serial# HBCD-100, Playing Time 77:47<br /><br />I must admit I wasn't looking forward to this CD; curiosity had the best of me...<br /><br />I thought \\"Start From The Dark\\" was a BIG disappointment as far as penmanship was concerned, but \\"Secret Society\\" displayed the right mixture of modern sounds from its predecessor with memorable melodies as a bonus...  and the \\"unplugged\\" formula has been used ad nauseam, and so is the use of an orchestra to augment the live performance.<br /><br />What a pleasant surprise to listen to this!!!  A good mixture of recent material as well as old favorites, with a very fresh approach (it's the string quartet that plays the memorable melody line of \\"The Final Countdown\\" instead of the keyboards).  And this CD is NOT unplugged (far from it!): perhaps a bit mellower, but Norum burns!<br /><br />There's also a tip of the hat to other bands, like PINK FLOYD's \\"Wish You Were Here\\", LED ZEPPELIN's \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\", Thin Lizzy's \\"Suicide\\" (Norum steals the show on this), and my favorite UFO track: \\"Love To Love\\".  I was ready to blast them out of the water for daring to take on that track! I'm an absolute devotee to Michael Schenker (even if I have everything John Norum ever released!), and I LOVE Phil Mogg's voice.  So I play the song, getting ready to scream \\"Sacrilege!!!\\" at the top of my lungs... but what a performance!!!  An ABSOLUTELY respectful rendition of the original, and Tempest just nails it!<br /><br />In short, this is possibly my favorite live CD from 2008: an impeccable (electrifying) performance from the band, in top shape, with the string quartet adding just the right amount of charm and texture to the performance, and a great choice of tracks, old and new: \\"Got To Have Faith\\", \\"Forever Travelling\\" and \\"Hero\\" are splendid, so are \\"Memories\\", \\"Superstitious\\" and \\"Dreamer\\".<br /><br />This CD is DEFINITELY worth the price of admission!  Hopefully the DVD will add additional tracks!  Will we get to see the teenage girls that keep screaming throughtout the performance? Maybe, maybe not... I don't care; I'll be (most probably) enjoying these fantastic performances with my eyes closed.<br /><br />In short:  PICK  THIS  UP !!!throughtout the performance? Maybe, maybe not... I don't care; I'll be (most probably) enjoying these fantastic performances with my eyes closed.    In short:   PICK   THIS   UP !!!
B0009IW88A|5.0|A pair of titans - Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard - use their incredible artistry to approach separate themes surrounding Bruce Wayne/Batman; Zimmer tackles the action sequences, while Newton Howard delves into the character scenes.<br /><br />Through electronic music and orchestral pieces, the 12 tracks depict the split personality of the superhero, with song titles that are different genera of bats (with a key word spelled out from the first letter of six titles). Though the composers had an ambitious 2 hours and 20 minutes of music for the film, the album \\"only\\" clocks in at 60:26.<br /><br />A surprisingly difficult album to track down, it is some of the most fascinating work from both composers.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|After the shocking delight I took in Absolution, 5 years after its release, I decided to play catch up and buy this album as well as 2 others.  At first listen, I was somewhat taken aback by the overt political nature of the album, and was afraid this might distract me from enjoying the music.  After several listens, however, the masterful musicians that are Muse defused any concern I had.  The music doesn't disappoint and I am once again amazed at the way I am completely mesmerized by the beauty and force of the sound.  It is another study in over the top and under the radar as was Absolution.  The only thing to lament is the rather absent treat of Bellamy's piano virtuosity that was on display in Absolution.  This album will move you nonetheless and, if you are like me, you can listen to it over and over with only increasing pleasure.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|This movie is dark and brooding, with an intelligent script and a great cast. I know that's what everyone is saying, and you probably know it by now too. If you haven't seen this movie, I would be very surprised, but I urge you to watch it. The tension and suspense that builds up to the final minutes is in tremendous amounts and the action is a plenty. As we all know, Heath Ledger's Joker is big in popular culture right now, and his performance is not overrated at all, i think. He truly makes this film scary with his acting chops and makes it hard to believe that such a young actor portrayed him with such twisted and dark brilliance. This role will always be remembered. I like the fact that the Batman series took this more serious dramatic turn because it is very fitting for the world of Gotham, which, by the way, is played wonderfully by Chicago, IL. The scenes of Tokyo are also very slick and nice.<br />I recommend you see this movie if you havent already, which I'm pretty sure you have ;)<br />9.1/10 stars
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Loved it. I used a holiday gift certificate that Amazon sent me to rent this. It was definitely as good as I'd heard. I don't buy a lot of dvd's, but this one will be one to add to mey collection.
1416594884|5.0|John Le Carre turns his still considerable literary and story-telling talents to the `war on terror' in his latest work. Set in Germany, a middle-aged ex-pat English private banker and a young idealistic left-wing lawyer form an unlikely alliance to help a somewhat mysterious illegal Chechen Muslim refugee when he turns up in ill-fated Hamburg. The Chechen has come to claim `black' bank account from the British banker with the aid of the lawyer.<br /><br />Their efforts quickly come under the eye of various counter-intelligence agencies: German, British, and US. Each agency has its own agenda in dealing with the trio. Le Carre does a nice job describing the nuances of the agencies' various modes, motivations, and interactions. One group of German agents, the good cops, wants to use the banker, the lawyer, and the Chechen (and the Chechen's money) to compromise and turn a prominent Muslim doctor with suspicious ties. The others, especially the Americans, have other ideas.<br /><br />Le Carre also creates an intriguing ambiguity as to who or what the Chechen really is. Is he a terrorist? A hapless victim? Likewise, with regard to Dr. Abdullah - is he a legitimate conduit for channeling money to leading Muslim charities or is he knowingly directing part of the funds to nefarious ends?<br /><br />I found the story less than compelling at times - in a word,  put-down-able (if that is a word). The motivations of the banker and to a lesser extent, the lawyer to take huge risks are not entirely convincing. But then LeCarre has never really produced page-turners.<br /><br />The interplay of the anti-terror cops with one another and their victims (no other word for it, really) leading to the sudden and the powerfully disturbing denouement - a sickening kick to the stomach made all the more distressing by its realism - compensate for any shortcomings. Not on a level with [[ASIN:0743455800 Smiley's People]], but much better than many of his post-Cold War offerings. Highly recommended. 4.5 stars.

B001KL3GWM|5.0|Solid 4+ star effort from the D.T. Band, which in my view just keeps going from strength to strength and which the liner notes rightly point out sounds more like a distinctive, coherent band here than ever before. These are bluesy rock (or rockin' blues) pop songs, tightly arranged and performed. What can appear to be a simple ordinary song turns into a chance for Trucks and Band to construct something deep yet also approachable. It's like seeing these guys walking with heads held high in the full sun, but in their eyes is the gleam of recognition of the wide and wilder world (full of joys, darkness and sorrows). The swampy funky sound can be a bit retro (late 60's and early 70's R&B, Soul, Rock), but that's a good thing, and yet its also breaking new ground in how well it's being played. And there is always Truck's tasteful, soulful slide playing which is timeless and has something important to say. Something that needs to be heard now more than ever.And how this band grooves and listens and PLAYS together is the expression of this message. Already Free, and Joyful, indeed.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|If you're looking for a song on this album that you expect to hear on the popular radio stations 30 times a day, you won't find it.  But surprisingly, this is a great thing.  Bon Iver's album is unique and timeless.  It's very deep and definitely takes you away.  It's great sleeping music too, and not in a bad way.  This is an album that you don't get tired of hearing over and over.  It's an album that you can listen to straight through, which is hard to come by these days.  If you're looking for a new fantastic singer/songwriter, you've come to the right place.

6300181286|5.0|Frankenstein is one hour and eleven minutes long and was released on November 21, 1931. It is hard to figure out where the movie takes place. You have actors with both British and English accents and the sets look to be, Germany, Austria or even Prussian. Also they movie never mentions the time period and since there is no sign of a phone anywhere it makes it even harder. The only thing electrical is the lab of Dr. Frankenstein in the old tower.  Boris Karloff does a great job as the Monster. From the first time the Monster makes an entrance to the death scene at the end; where a windmill house is set to fire and a wood beam falls on him. During the opening credits a ? is shown next the Monster. Only at the end of the film when the credits begin to roll is it revealed that Boris Karloff played the Monster. Karloff would play the Monster in two more films. The movie begins with a warning from actor Edward Van Sloan indicating the scariness of the movie and if you are due to fainting spells or have a weak stomach, leave now. After the warning the movie begins and the scene is at a commentary where a funeral is taking place. Dr. Frankenstein and Fritz, his loyal assistant, are hiding nearby waiting patiently for the party to leave so they can rob the grave. With the body in tow the two head back to the tower. Back at the ancestral home of Baron Von Frankenstein, Henry's fiancée Elizabeth is upset over a letter she has received from Henry. Henry's best friend, Victor Moritz, tries to help her. They both seek Henry's old mentor Doctor Waldman. Doctor Waldman tells Elizabeth and Victor about Henry's experiments and how his demand for body parts got out of control. Henry left the institute and that was the last he heard of him. Elizabeth and Victor convince Doctor Waldman to with them to visit Henry at the old watch tower. The trio arrives at the old watch tower just moments before Dr. Frankenstein is to make the greatest experiment of his life. Dr. Frankenstein escorts all three to the lab to witness his creation to come to life. When they lower lab table from the electrical storm and the Monster moves his right hand a little Dr. Frankenstein utters his famous words \\"It's Alive\\". The next day Elizabeth and Victor are back home and Henry's father thinks there is another woman but both tries to tell him that he is finishing up his experiment. The Baron does not believe it and all three head back to the watch tower. Back at the watch tower Dr. Frankenstein shows compassion for the Monster saying it is only is a few days old and have not seen light. It is during this time that movie audience is first introduced to the monster. Henry sort of acts like a father figure at first then Fritz brings in a lighted torch and the monster goes wild. Fritz, Henry, and Doctor Waldman ties up the creature and take him to the dungeon. It is there that the monster makes his first kill. Fritz takes delight in torturing the Monster where Henry just wants him left alone. One day Fritz pushes the Monster too far and the creature kills Fritz. Dr. Frankenstein and Doctor Waldman are able to subdue the Monster and come to conclusion that creature must be destroyed. During the struggle to sedate the Monster Henry is severely hurt and is sent home to recover. Doctor Waldman is about to operate on the Monster when the Monster awakes and kills Doctor Waldman; victim number two. The Monster escapes and is next seen playing with little Maria and both are tossing flowers into the lake. When there are no more flowers, the Monster tosses Maria into the lake to see if she can float. When the Monster realizes what he has done and leaves. The father of Maria carries her lifeless body into town and tells the Burgomaster that she was murdered. The Burgomaster organizes a search party for the murder with Henry leading one of the groups. Henry finds the Monster and the Monster renders Henry unconscious. The Monster takes Henry to the top of an abandon windmill. The villagerstrap the Monster and the Monster throws out the windmill. Dr. Henry Frankenstein is taken back to his home to recover. The windmill is set to fire and the Monster is destroyed. If you are a fan of the Universal Horror\Monster movies, then this is for you. Dr. Henry Frankenstein is shown resting in bed in the final scene. Frankenstein gets an AAAAA+++++.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|This is, by far, the worst adaptation of a Jane Austen novel that I have ever seen.  The reason Jane Austen works are so beloved is that she gives her characters such depth and subtlety, all of which is lost in this incredibly shallow, hollywood-ized piece of garbage.  The characters were poorly cast and even more poorly developed by the actors playing them.  I have never hated a screen adaptation of any novel more than I despise this.  I have to believe that the people giving this 4 and 5 stars have either not read the novel, or just don't \\"get it\\".
8590379825|4.0|In [[ASIN:8590379825 Programming in Lua, Second Edition]] Roberto does a very good job of balancing the introduction of the language to the new Lua programmer, while keeping it interesting for the seasoned Lua programmer.    He points out clearly where a feature being discussed is only available in the newest versions of the language and still instills confidence that the book you are reading will be relevant as the language grows.    Coverage of the language and how to integrate with C is very through, although it would benefit the book to have a few larger, more complex, programming examples to give a feel for Lua in the large.    Overall I think it is a great introduction to the language and probably should be on every aspiring Lua programmers bookshelf (if it already isn't).
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Boston is awesome and this album is really awesome. Foreplay longtime is really good but a bit long, and other than that these songs are perfection. Peace of mind, smokin', more than a feeling, all of em! 5 stars all the way!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'll start out this review by saying that I'm not that familiar with Joss Whedon and his work.<br /><br />I'll follow up that statement with this:  This DVD makes me want to see more of what he's done.<br /><br />\\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" is fantastic.  I missed this thing when it was a big deal on the internet months ago, but last month I caught it online after hearing non-stop praise for it, and immediately after it finished, I ordered the DVD.<br /><br />Simply put, its great.  And that's coming from a guy who really really doesn't like musicals.<br /><br />After hearing that it was a musical about a super hero/villian love triangle I half expected some ridiculous, ultra-campy cult thing like The Rocky Horror Picture Show or that REPO! Genetic Opera thing, but I was very relieved to find this project to be very normal and accessible despite how weird that description makes it all sound.<br /><br />But I won't waste your time with plot, all you need to know is that its wonderfully acted (the subtle touches in NPHs performance are just brilliant), the songs are very good (again, this is made more significant coming from a man who really doesn't like musicals), and its SO INCREDIBLY FUNNY (\\"We do the weird stuff!\\")!!!  I've seen this 4 times in the last week and every single time through I find myself catching something I missed before.  Most of those times I was playing it for friends and every one of them enjoyed it to the point of laughing out loud as well.  And that includes people from ages 19-52, all busting a gut over this DVD.<br /><br />Some might not like the ending, but I found myself reacting to it the same way I did to the ending of \\"Cloverfield\\" meaning that when you take a bit of time to consider what all leads up to it, the ending really makes a lot of sense, and it certainly isn't \\"the wrong way to end it\\" even if it isn't the finale you were probably expecting.  In fact, I'd say its a great ending.<br /><br />All in all, its a fantastic DVD, and one that I'm happy to own even if you can see this online for free.  Give it a chance (why not? it IS free online), you'll be pleasantly surprised.s online for free.  Give it a chance (why not? it IS free online), you'll be pleasantly surprised.
0061703087|5.0|I was intrested in this book from the moment nano particles were mentioned. From there it just took off and went with the story. The family is intresting and the main charcter is also very intresting, and he isn't unlikeable. I think he is a real reflection of the author in many ways. Also the ending actually surprised me and I didn't see it coming. I had an idea, but it wasn't anything like it. I was done the book rather quickly, and was left satisfied.  Michael Chrichton fans, you should like this book, it is very intresting.
006135323X|5.0|If you think that you make rational, reasoned decisions, or that you are the master of your domain, etc., then you might consider reading Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions by Dan Ariely.<br /><br />This book provides a very interesting glimpse into just how humans make decisions in real life---it turns out that in a variety of situations, humans are not the masters of rationality that we assume them to be.<br /><br />Economics is very good at making lots of models to predict supply and demand, though a core assumption is that humans will always make rational decisions. One look at the current economy gives weight to the statement that economists have a very hard time with getting their complex models to reflect, in any reasonable way, reality. Dan's take on economics is that humans, more often than not, make irrational decisions, leading to a new field called Behavioral Economics. Through a series of very interesting experiments, Dan shows that his suppositions are correct---humans make irrational decisions a lot, and the results of his experiments give insight into why and how people respond as they do to life situations.<br /><br />Example experiments include testing human decision making when we have lots of options, how our decision making is distorted when we are sexually aroused, why we are dishonest, and how we are influenced by the placebo effect and the power of suggestion.<br /><br />I found this book very entertaining---now I know why a 50-cent Aspirin works and a 1-cent Aspirin doesn't---and I do think Dan has done a great service in highlighting and investigating how humans really make decisions, as opposed to how traditional economists assume we make decisions.<br /><br />(review by Kendall Giles)
1439102813|5.0|I wasn't quite sure how I'd react to reading a novel about Alzheimer's disease.  Having a mother who is 89 and suffering from this diagnosis, it might come too close to home.  But the rave reviews convinced me to read this. And I am so glad I did.      As a highly-respected cognitive psychology professor at Harvard, Alice Howland deals with the mind and memory all the time and is a much sought after speaker at conferences throughout the world.  Her only worries seem to be how she is going to fit everything into her busy day and her younger daughter who seems dedicated to going to acting school instead of college.      When she becomes disoriented one day in an area that should have been very familiar to her, has word finding problems, and a missed period, at age 50, she naturally assumes she must be menopausal and makes an appointment with her doctor for a checkup.  However it isn't long before her physician figures her problems may be much more severe. She is referred to a specialist who, after a series of tests, eventually diagnoses her with the devastating diagnosis of early-onset Alzheimer's dementia.      Alice is stunned.  How could this be happening to her?  She ends up eventually telling her husband and then her children.  At first Alice goes about her life as usual, continuing to give her lectures and other daily activities.  It isn't long though before she discovers that the disease has taken over and her life will never be the same.    This is an amazing novel by first-time author Lisa Genova who has a PhD in neuroscience from Harvard and is an online columnist for the National Alzheimer's Association.  Along with the book, The 36-Hour Day, this should be required reading for anyone caring for an Alzheimer's patient or even knowing someone tragically struck with this disease.  Genova explains Alzheimer's in a way that is easy to understand and shows it so vividly in the character of Alice.  I couldn't put this book down and am recommending it to everyoneI know, whether or not they have been personally affected by Alzheimer's.
0316010669|4.0|I am a physician and I have had the privilege of being trained by Dr Reilly at the Cook County Hospital (the chest pain evaluation part of the book).    I just want to impress upon the point that Dr Reilly did not teach us that too much information is misleading. What he taught us is to assess the quality of the information and then to use only that information which is of good quality.    In simple terms, there are some parts of the history, the physical exam, EKG and labs which strongly rule things in or rule things out. It is that kind of information which is useful. Other pieces of information which do not lead you strongly one way or the other are merely distractions.

0753810204|5.0|I'm not a physicist by profession though I conduct my own general inquiries into foundational issues of mathematical physics. I have read this book and I am deeply impressed and intrigued by the whole wealth of ideas and research works used by Julian to formulate his key concepts. As I read about Julian's life I find him a very committed scientist to probe deeper issues. While this book avoids explicit use of mathematical equations nevertheless, one needs to do a background study on his referenced papers in order to understand arguing grounds of this book.       There is only Quantum Statics!  This is the key concept (and also mathematically argued) main theme of this book as Julian himself puts this on 2nd paragraph of page 253.     Now in my view this goes against all the impressions and ideas we have from what is generally considered as changing/temporal universe. It is so obvious that all is about motion and change and (almost) all formulations of general relativity and quantum mechanics do involve a time coordinate in order to capture this so basic observation, rate of change!     This is where Julian goes beyond or (deeper into) generally introduced framework of physics and attempts to introduce a Machian formulation of general relativity to probe into roots of (apparent) conflict among unification efforts of Quantum Mechanics with General Relativity: introduce a space of all possible relative configurations, called Platonia, which contains all possible relative configurations of everything that could ever exist(I'm adding some bits of my own wording here) and try to employ intriguing concepts/tools like `Best Matching' and `Machian Distinguished Simplifier' to trace how a notion of change comes into our ordinary formulation of dynamics.  I consider these as requisites to grasp this book. Julian uses simple examples to convey his concepts.     As much as I understand Julian's works, it could be the implications of ideas are so powerful that if understood properly and imagined for their repercussions, they would open a door to a new view of workings of universe, reconciliation of classical field theories is one of them plus hint at deeper imports of gauge fields as derivative of Best Matching (expert readers may refer to Bruno Bertotti's papers in this regard).      I would rather not make any philosophical conclusions for the message that our universe is actually is static universe but I would encourage those readers of Heidegger's works in phenomenology of time and being to match Julian's ideas with Martin Heidegger's open ended inquiries.     I would recommend this book to anyone interested in nature of time; there are many other books written on the subject but this one is an exception. As for me it helped me with better understanding of classical dynamics.     Alireza
B001GKJ2FW|5.0|If you like feel-good movies, this is the one for you. Abba music plus some of the best actors in the business can't fail to get you up and dancing. Pierce Brosnan couldn't sing if you paid him (which presumably they did), but he gets full marks for sticking in there and doing his best. Amanda Seyfried is just the bouncy young thing you'd want for the part and Meryl Streep looks like she's having a blast throughout the movie.    The blu-ray version is excellent. Tack sharp and beautiful color with excellent sound.    Highly recommended.
B00000AFFI|4.0|Is This Desire? being her 1998 release and her 5th studio album is an album that I like instantly. This is a very experimental album that sounds like a mix between rock, industrial, and experimental music. The lyrics are very strange to say the least but very deep and meaningfull. The booklet is more or less a travesty with a bunch of pictures seemingly thrown together at random. Her vocals are very special and she has a very personal voice. Songs that standout on this release are \\"A Perfect Day Elise\\" and \\"The Wind\\". 4/5.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Supernatural, is clever, funny, relevant, and scary. With real characters we can care about and amazing situations that are rendered believable by the down to earth dialogue and event progression, this is a groundbreaking show. Gritty, real, and chock full of amazing effects this series is a must see for any Sci-Fi or Horror fan or anyone who is interested in being entertained. Written with a nod to the intelligence and humor of its audience I cannot rave enough about this series, every season keeps improving on the last and continuing the entire overall arch of the Winchester's with the legitimacy of any other genre. ABSOLUTELY watch.

B000QMUDTU|4.0|I never read a Steven King novel, but I bought this book because it was in the writers' section of Barnes and Noble, and I thought this would be the perfect gift for my 16 year old daughter, who thinks she might become a professional writer some day.  Well, it was a Christmas present, but I picked it up, began perusing the text, and I couldn't put it down.  Steven King deserves all the millions he has made, because he is a hard-working professional, who is dedicated to his craft, and he's good at it.  I found this book inspirational, and I hope my daughter reads it and gains encouragement.
B0006L5RT2|4.0|James Blunt has a very unique voice. I first heard \\"Beautiful\\" and rushed out to hear what else he would sing. Each song is cool in its own way. Goodbye Jimmy ( who I believe is for Morrison ) is one of my favorites with such power and beautiful organ. I have played this c d over and over and sing the songs in my head thereafter. I am in love with Blunt and his voice.
B001ECE6C6|5.0|I don't know where to begin and will have to come back and write a more expansive review, but for the moment, suffice it to say that this is the best disc Metheny has ever recorded. The dialectical endeavour with this singer from Poland has compelled him to reconsider well known pieces and collaborate of her material as well to stunning effect. Jopek has a crystal clear voice that is uniquely Eastern European. A slight change of inflection and you might be listening to Marta Sebestyen. Anna marie is her own person though, and it was she who took the initiative on this collaboration. Metheny was nothing short of generous, but it's clear that once engaged, he was fulyy committed at a level I have not heard since SECRET STORY. And believe it or not, this is even better. And! they perform \\"Tell Her You Saw Me\\" from STORY with such powerful effect you will swear that you are hearing this for the first time. Jopek enlists a number of Polish jazz musicians and Metheny plays as though on fire with them. Their collective resetting of \\"Are You Going With Me?\\" will leave you amazed. Essentially. Jopek wrote lyrics or mouth music to some of Metehny's tunes, and Metheny filled out the charts on a number of her songs, and it is thus a very intense collaboration.  This is nothing short of brilliant and already nails it as the best jazz CD of '09. If you had purchased this last year in the EU, note that the US release has a couple of new compositions from teh two of them and two live performances. Well worth a new purchase. THis will only serve to heighten and intensify Metheny's remarkable soulful and lyrical playing, and it is his very highest achievement to date.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|i love this movie for how bad it is. everything is over acted, but i love it. its so bad it s good!!!  i love how over the top it is. and anyone who says its the worst movie ever should go watch movies made by ed wood. now those are some really bad movies.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I had purchased all of Kelly's cds prior to this one and bought My December the first week it came out. Their are only certain singers that I personally will buy their cd without hearing more than 1 song and Kelly is definitely 1 of them. To be honest it took 2 to 3 silent solo listening parties before I became a fan of this cd, I guess at first I was expecting Breakaway 2. My December is so heart wrenching and earnest, not something you would expect from a 24 year old. Number 9 is probably my favorite along with the hidden track `Irvine' which to me seems to be a talk she's having with God, oh but wait I also love Sober, Be Still, Can I have a kiss........ hell the whole cd rocks!    I am so proud of Kelly for staying true to herself and not allowing record execs to put her in a box. She is the best artist to come out of American Idol, with Jennifer Hudson and Chris Daughtry tied for second.  This is a beautiful cd, different from her previous works, showing her depth as an artist and women. We all grow as people and this cd is a reflection of Kelly's growth. If you want corny hooks with manufactured vocals, go pick up Britney's latest cd, 'My December' is not for you!
B000SJJCX4|1.0|I had to return TWO of these back to the seller because they were both unusable due to defects.  The third one (!) is also poor quality. The tuning is accurate, I'll give it that- while it works.  However, after less than a year of normal use, this one has stopped working, too.  I press the pedal-nothing.  It sucks down batteries at an incredible rate, too, and due to poor design, it's extremely frustrating trying to replace the 9V battery.  I would never buy another one.<br /><br />Better Choices:  The Fender PT-100 and the Boss TU-2
0618526412|5.0|There is a lot I could say about \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\", but I'll put it simply: everyone should read this book, which is probably one of the greatest American novels ever written.  This is a profoundly beautiful and tragic work that will stay in your thoughts long after you finish reading it.  Of course, like any classic you need to approach this work with an open mind and a certain amount of life experience to really appreciate this work, but I think there is something here for everyone to enjoy and be affected by.    So what is this book about?  The plot is very simple: a group of sad, lonely, disillusioned people share their hopes and disappointments with a compassionate deaf-mute.  On a deeper level though, this book is about the struggles we all face as we go through life and try to reach our goals.  It's also a profoundly insightful look at loneliness and friendship.  Be warned though, McCullers' treatment of these themes is extremely bleak and it's hard to find any sort of hope or optimism as the novel draws to a close.  Sometimes you're not going to be able to get what you really want, no matter how badly you want it.  Sometimes the people you care about deeply are not going to feel the same way about you.  Sometimes this is what life is really like, and McCullers doesn't pull any punches with her readers or delude them into believing otherwise.  Ironically, this book will show you that life doesn't often turn out the way you read about in books.  Despite such a grim out-look, this is poetic realism at its finest.    I can't recommend this book enough, and if you didn't read it when Oprah told you to (and her taste in literature is actually not bad), then read it now!
0375826726|3.0|I read Eragon and Eldest a long time ago and enjoyed them immensely so, when Brisingr finally came out, I was very excited to read the third installment of this epic fantasy series.  Because the tension and scope of this story have evolved so much, this book was much more violent than the previous books in this series.  I do not mind reading about violence, but what bothered me was the way in which the characters in the story responded to all of the killing that they had done.  They brought up their moral problems a couple of times but, in all real respects, they acted as if life just went on.  Maybe the violent times that they had grown up in  made them look upon the issue differently than people today, but I suspect that if any one person had actually killed almost 200 men at once, or was the cause of the mass killing of army after army, there would be more emotional repercussions.    There was only one other thing that stood in the way of me completely enjoying this book.  This was the way that all of the characters spoke.  Though I think that overall Paolini's writing has improved, his writing is much too aware of itself and he makes all of his characters speak in much the same way.  For each species, he does have them say a couple words in their own language so that it seams that they are speaking english as a second language, but the basic patterns in  their speech seem too similar to properly represent the myriad of characters that he portrays.     However, moving on from these two annoyances, I found this book tho be very enjoyable and fascinating to read.  There are plot twists in Brisingr that I was not expecting at all and the ending was moving without becoming sappy.  It added to the series and continued developing its characters.  I really appreciated the fact that some of the choices that the \\"good characters\\" were making were not entirely likable even though as the  reader I could not come up with a better solution given the circumstances that they were in.  Too often, I read a book in which everything that the good characters do is commendable and everything that the bad characters do is horrible.    Overall, I would not say that this book will ever be considered a gem of early 21st century literature, but it is an interesting book that is enjoyable to read.  Paolini's storytelling is very good, but sometimes he gets to wrapped up in adjectives and forgets to keep the story moving.  This is a book that is easy to get completely immersed in as long as the critiquing is suspend until it has been finished.
031606792X|5.0|I, like so many others have been consumed by the twilight series, and I want more!!!! I loved the 4th book. I love a happy ending.  I believe a few things were missing but I really love this book.  It gave me everything i needed to say goodbye.  It made the fantasy real. I am so happy she gave them everything they wanted for a good reason, she wanted it to be over and im happy thinking about Bella, Edward, their baby, and the rest of the cullen family happy, living loving and enjoying their happily ever after!!!!!!Meyer you are the best!!!!!!
0446615641|4.0|I continue to really like David Baldacci's novels.  They are fun, fast paced and just plain enjoyable to read.....Always looking forward to the next one....
B000683VI4|5.0|This is a lovely movie and is one of the best romantic movies I have ever seen. It is not cheesy or silly, but is a realistic, poignant love story. It is about enduring love, a love that lasts forever, a love that everyone wants to find at least once in their life. When you watch this movie, it makes you laugh, it makes you cry- you feel intoxicated as you watch these two characters fall in love, and  heartbroken when you see them as an older couple, dealing with the issues that befall older people. It is a great movie- I highly recommend it.

0156030209|5.0|Rather than review Life of Pi, which I read many years ago, liked, and now love, I chose to respond to J.C. Anderson's review - J.C. really disliked this book.     Unfortunately, it doesn't seem I can put the permalink in this review - so here's how to find my response and our dialogue.    1. Look at the Amazon reviews for Life of Pi. On the left you will see the Most Helpful Customer Reviews; on the right, in a narrower column, Most Recent Customer Reviews.    2. Scroll down until you get to the bottom of Most Recent Customer Reviews (again, on right side). There will be a \\"Search Customer Reviews\\" box.     3. Type \\"malarkey\\" in the box and click Go!. J.C.'s review, titled \\"Worst Book EVER!\\" will show as a result, as he uses that word in his review.    4. Click Read More. This will give you his review and my responses.     Two things: first, I respect J.C.'s opinion - I do not attack him. Second, I know this is more effort than reading the other reviews, but you may find it wortwhile to see a direct debate on the book (J.C. responds a couple of times).
B001P22HK8|5.0|This is a great book. I can't wait for his next book. i could not put this book down!

0316017922|1.0|I understand why someone would pay money to hear a child babble incoherently into a microphone.  Children are cute and sometimes say the darndest things to boot!  As for Gladwell, well if the red 'fro is your thing then feel free to attend one of those speaking tours for which he commands five-figure sums of money per engagement.  I warn you , however, that Gladwell does not say the darndest things.  He says the dumbest things.  Over and over again.    It's not that his arguments are poor; it's not even that he does not know how to construct an argument.  He does not even consider arguing.  For example, take his argu...er...contention that East Asians do well in math because of the cultural legacy of rice patties.  A person of normal intelligence would understand that an immensely outlandish claim such as this requires convincing evidence and persuasive reasoning, and that without this evidence, there would be no more reason for anyone to accept it (or to even register it as a possibility) than there would be to accept an equally outlandish theory that they get their math skills from a secret society with Panda Bears.      But no evidence is presented.  All that Gladwell gives is some scenario that describes how this could be the case (and all of these are implausible in the extreme, and betray on Gladwell's part a startling degree of ignorance as to how things really operate in the real world) and then he moves on to the next fanciful speculation.  Gladwell has no clue that there are methods and documents available to test these theories.  He seems uninterested in investigating his notions through, even at a superficial level.  Like a Seinfeld routine, he takes a subject that intrigues him, muses upon it for a page, and moves on to the next.  Unlike Seinfeld, there are no clever twists to redeem what is essentially a non-book about nothing.    Malcom, write a book on how you managed to con this many gullible, mindless people into taking you seriously, and I'll pre-order it.  How did you become a post-modern PT Barnum who's biggest dupe is your own self?
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|My favorite of the Dark Knight Trilogy.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This is an awesome CD. It has hits like Sweet Child O' Mine, Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, Knockin' on Heavens Door, Live and Let Die, and a few others. The lyrics are great and Slash just rocks on the guitar. Drums are great and bass is cool too. All in all If you enjoy good ol' 80s rock then this is an excellent CD for you.
B00005PJ6M|3.0|Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey is a good sequel to ...Excellent Adventure but I was hoping for so much more. Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, and George Carlin reprise their role and I do like the Seventh Seal send-up of this film, the grim reaper is the best part of the film. Reeves sure makes the audience believe he is that shallow, bravo! Check this hidden treasure out sometime!
B00003CXD0|4.0|I'm not sure which film came out first but the similarities between the two are obvious: Man pretends to be a woman to get a desperately needed job but ends up falling in love with a woman and doesn't know how to tell her resulting in humourous events versus woman pretends to be a man who pretends to be a woman to get a desperately needed job but ends up falling in love with a man and doesn't know how to tell him resulting in humourous events.  The most important similarity though is that both films age pretty well and remains entertaining to this day although \\"Victor/Victoria\\" in my opinion has the edge in terms of better aging and retention of entertainment value.<br /><br />I found \\"Tootsie\\" extremely side-splittingly funny the first time I saw it many years ago but as is to be expected with comedies in general in that they are made for the audiences of that time i.e. 1980s here and there are only so many times you can hear a joke before it becomes cliched and just contempt-inducing which is why \\"Tootsie\\" is so good in that it is still able to retain much of its humour and entertainment value like all classic films should.  The scenes with Pollack and Hoffman I found to be the most entertaining and humourous and I was impressed at director Pollack's acting skills as I thought he was very, very funny in his role as Michael Dorsey's agent.  The cast in general was also very good which is not surprising when you have Bill Murray, Jessica Lange and Teri Garr on board.<br /><br />The sound quality of this dvd version is pretty good having been given the 5.1 Surround treatment although the picture quality has not been restored giving it a very good VHS quality feel although thankfully very few imperfections such as white spots are noticeable so that overall the picture quality is acceptable.  There are no special features to mention although the anamorphic widescreen side of the disc is the much better way to view this as the full screen version side of the disc just takes too much of the picture away to the point that whole actors are left out of many frames when you compare it with the widescreen version.<br /><br />Overall an acceptably good dvd standard format version of a good comedy that ages well although the great Dave Grusin soundtrack does have a downside of dating this film with its 80s sounding theme making sure you know that this is an 80s flick.  Still an amusing and enjoyable film to watch.<br /><br />Recommended.of the picture away to the point that whole actors are left out of many frames when you compare it with the widescreen version.

B001D84NKQ|5.0|This was a very good movie.  A Tarantino rip off for sure but well done.  The sound track is great.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|This is a more realistic western with a good story and attention to detail.  The actors really pull off a great movie in this one.  Jeremy Irons is a excellent villian who seems to escape justice. Has he reformed or is he as bad as ever?  That's for the viewer to decide and one thing we don't have to decide on is that Ed Harris needs to direct more movies like this one. Whatever time period he decides to set his next movie in.<br />The lead actress also takes a person that is too easy to judge and makes her seem very sympathetic to a degree. After all in the old west, women without a alpha male protector were in extreme danger. Especially of finding themselve; due to poverty of being confined to absolute prostitution.  At least until the rule of law and civilizing of all the boom towns took place. This usually was a 2 to at most 4 year period for most towns.<br />Everything works well in this movie and in blue ray the picture shines with a great print and excellent mastering.  If  you like westerns or a a good story about a lonely man who falls for a flawed woman but understands why she is the way she is , then you will enjoy this great movie.

0793538491|3.0|The transcriptions here are very faithful to the recorded tracks and even the piano parts are transcribed for guitar.  As you probably already know, Brian May rarely ever just has the one guitar part in any of his recorded versions and so you get here all the different guitar parts that are added to the mix.  I got this mostly for \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" and \\"'39\\" but now I realise that I probably should have gotten the original \\"Queen Greatest Hits\\" with the black cover if that was available.<br /><br />\\"Night At the Opera\\" is a great album but other than \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" the other guitar parts are good but not his best work and I now realise that I'd rather learn his solos to \\"Killer Queen\\" and riffs to \\"Now I'm Here\\" etc and so I'd recommend you to consider getting a Best of compilation rather than this one unless of course you want to learn how to play all the tracks of this album.  If you are looking for May's best work you'll need to look elsewhere although May's still very good here on this album but I think you know what I mean.<br /><br />The book binding though is poor as the pages come out pretty easily with a little use and I haven't really been using the book much let alone rough handling it but I'm not confident that the pages will stay for long attached to the book spine.<br /><br />Great transcriptions but the book binding itself could have been much better executed.
0684824906|4.0|Don't get me wrong.  This is a good book, but it's not as good as I thought it would be or had heard it would be.  I expected more from Doris Kearns Goodwin.  It didn't go into the political genius as much as I wanted.  It details the four men in Lincoln's cabinet that play a major role.  It's more about them and their interactions than it is about Lincoln's political moves.  There is a lot of interesting descriptions of the generals, but I got tired of the McClennan drama being detailed.  I definitely didn't enjoy the pleasure that Ms. Goodwin got from detailing Kate Chase's every move.  I just wish this book had been a little shorter and concise about events.  It needed in my opinion to be more about Lincoln's political thoughts and why he did what he did. However, I did enjoy the background of Seward, Chase, Stanton and Cameron.  I would only recommend this book to amateur historians and not the general public who are picking it up because President Obama mentioned it.
0810970686|5.0|This is an amazingly funny book.  The Wimpy Kid series should not be confined to people under 18 so I highly urge adults to read all three as soon as possible.  My sides hurt and yes, my eyes watered.  The book is so funny and each one is better than the last which means The Last Straw is the funniest so far.  The author has a knack of mentioning things that kids and kids who have gotten older can all identify with.  It's great.  My favorite scene in this book was the gym class in which middle school students are urged by their gym teacher and other teachers to dance the Hokey Pokey!  What a nightmare!  What fun!  Rowley is the sad sack friend who is embarrassing to be with and makes a great stooge for our hero.  Mom is supposedly \\"hip\\" and so uncool that she needs to be kept in the house and not let out for activities that involve being \\"with it\\".  Dad can't stay on a diet and Greg's New Year's Resolution is telling everybody else what's wrong with them!  Just a wonderful book and I think that we will see more of them.  This is truly a classic series and too good just to be isolated in the kids' section.  Adults get your \\"Young Adult\\" reading done now!  My excuse?  I teach middle school.
B001LRJH0K|5.0|If you're looking for the 3:10 to Yuma then catch another train.  Appaloosa is a slower and character driven movie.  When the shooting starts it's done in an authentic manner with no hollywood fast-draws out of modern day low slung holsters.  The attention to historic detail is fantastic.  As a resident of New Mexico I was happy to see many familar areas used in the filming.  Also I was pleased that much of the dialog between Cole and Hitch was straight from the pages of the book.  This movie might not be for everyone but if you are looking for an authentic western and well told story this one works just fine.

To bad the season was cut short by the writers strike, but still one of the best and is only getting better.  Jared and Jensen are great and can go from action to horror to comedy and drama in a split second.  Ruby and Bella add to the show and of course Metalicar has a special place in any Supernatural fans heart.

The writing style is concise and to the point, but there are enough good code examples to illustrate each point. This is a great book for busy people who don't have time to read a couple of hours a day. Each of the 70+ topics can be read during a lunch break. The author explains each topic in a way that is easy to understand for developers of all skill levels. I have been in IT for 12 years, and this is one of my top 5 favorite computer books.
B00111L0MY|4.0|Some people hate or simply don't care about the Afflecks. I didn't care about them until I saw Hollywoodland(Ben was very good in it),and now Casey here(I haven't seen the \\"Jesse James\\" movie, yet).  Ben proved to be a very good director with this movie.  Casey was impredictable and gave a very good performance.  The rest of the cast was very good too; Ed Harris, Amy Madigan, Morgan Freeman and Amy Ryan among others.  But two things I won't forget too soon;  First, Ryan's performance when she asks the cop to promise he will find her daughter(I usually don't cry at movies, and I was shocked to catch a tear or two rolling down my face while watching that scene).  Second, the amazing ending of this movie(Another moment of tears for me).  The message is powerful, but the best thing is that the story leaves it all up for YOU to be the judge.  One of the best \\"cop\\" movies I've seen lately and I'll put it up there ABOVE \\"Mystic River\\" and \\"The Departed\\".    Highly recommended!!!
0312370849|5.0|Ususally I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction however this book is an exception.  While I agree it is an \\"easy\\" read, that isn't a bad thing.  I loved Sarah and felt that her storyline was wonderfully interesting.  I found myself looking up facts about the actual round up and talking to my high school aged kids about it as well.  It's a shame that this is not something that is taught.    The present day storyline was also intersting.  It really makes you realize the impact others can have on your life and how families can and do work through difficulties.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Bought the game Blokus for my teenage son for Christmas.  He always wants to play board games with his father and me, but we just want to play a game, not a saga (as with Monopoly).  Instructions are easy to learn and a typical game takes approx. 15 minutes.  Just wish I could think ahead a few moves as my son does so I could actually win once in a while.  Great for exercising the brain.

Nothing replaces the real thing, but this is a close second. Turn off the lights, turn up the surround sound and be transported. Enjoy :) Long live Floyd!!
0440237688|5.0|I read this book in the seventh grade and totally overlooked its importance. I only read it because my teacher made me. Well I joined a book club and this was the first book on our list. I went to the library and picked it up. When I got home I opened the book and finished it in a matter of hours.    I must say this book is amazing. A utopian society absent of color, books, animals, and sex. EEekkk!!! I can't say I could live in a world like that. The story of the giver debunks any chance of humans living in a utopian society. I believe that Lois Lowry predicted accurately that in order to live in a world of peace we would have to live in a world filled with sameness.     Definitely a good read, highly recommended!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|I simply can not get over this movie.  I watched it with english subs, namely because of its 97% RT rating.  All I have to say now is, I'm stunned.  The film succeeds on all levels.  I didn't feel robbed at the end, the ending was unexpected and magnificent.    The main two leads are stunning in their parts, especially the girl.  At the end, the viewer is witness to carnage, but left with no horror, no guilt, nothing but love and happiness towards the doer of the carnage.    I wanted the movie to end before this scene, I thought it should because it was so perfect (besides the violent cat scene), but the addition, and the encounter with Oskar's bullies at the end was triumphent.      Easily the best horror movie of all time and likely has graced the top 15 list for my best all time live action movies.    Del Torro, ever since Pan's Labyrinth, has been a stunningly poignant director, able to match both violence and the deepest emotions of love together in any setting.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Stunning effects, a sound track rivaling the best movies, varied and believeable characters, and a true story told through the eyes of those who lived it.  It's all there, from officers both chicken-bleep and successful, the freezing cold of the winter of 1944-45 (both my father and father-in-law were there and agree it was the coldest experience of their lives), the blood and guts spilled, and mental turmoil men endured.

B000ZLFALS|3.0|This movie starts out great, with great use of The Beatles' songs in interesting ways.  Then the middle comes along - still some interesting use of The Beatles' songs, but not necessarily in a good way.  The best way to describe it is \\"weird,\\" devolving into a psychadelic mess.  The last third is better than the middle third, but not as good as the first act.  The third act (and thus the film overall) is largely anti-climactic.  Watch the first third of the movie and move on.
0307454894|4.0|I read this a few years ago when it was recommended to me to help improve my rusty German and was gripped by it. It offers an insight into the dilemma which has faced those generations of Germans who were too young to be personally guilty but who knew those who were; as colleagues, or worse as friends, or even worse as family. In this case as an early sexual partner; and as having a Nazi criminal for a father or uncle might blight your family life when you found out, so might what happens to the narrator here blight your emotional life.     As those who bore personal guilt die off and even those who knew them age (most of today's Germans have never met anyone who was of adult age during the Nazi era) this dilemma ceases to arise, but since evil will occur again it behoves us all to think how we would act if we were faced with those who had perpetrated it. In short, what we would do if we were this young man.
0743297334|5.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" is one of the classic novels in American literature that lives up to its reputation. This cynical take on the lives of American expatriates in Europe after WWI has a beautiful disconnected feel to it that anyone can relate to, and the doomed love between the protagonist and his ex-lover is palpable, and at times even heartwrenching.     But the best part about this book is the writing: Hemingway at his sparsest, most direct, and yet somehow most evocative despite himself. The barren wording is hypnotic in its subtle glory.    It's a great, quick, and easy read; there's really no reason not to pick this up.

The action was great in the aforementioned movie, the chemistry was not as good, and some of the acting weak....but hey it was still fun. If you love the Mummy movies and don't have them all, this is a great deal for the price.

B000RZIGVS|5.0|I didn't really start catching this show until the end seasons. But I didn't become a big fan of the show until I started catching daily reruns after it was already off. This is a great show that has held up really well. This is probably the most popular Star Trek show and for good reason. It has a great cast of characters and some excellent storylines. Sadly the first season of the show I find too cheesy to watch. The show picks up tremendously in the second season and by the third season it was in peek form. Arguably the show peaked in seasons 3-5, but it continued to have good episodes into season 7.   I got the older collection which was the 7 individual seasons, so I cannot comment on the positives or negatives of this boxed set. It does appear that the boxed set is more compact, but the individual seasons, have better packaging.

Thibault decides to pick it up and try to give it back to it's owner. He puts the picture on a board at the entrance of the computer center, where he's sure the owner will see it and claim it. After a about a week, Thibault notices that the picture is still there. On a whim, he decides to pick up the picture and keep it. It's not until a few things happen and his life is spared, that his friend, Victor, points out that Thibault's luck has improved since he has gotten the picture. Thibault decides to keep the picture for good luck.<br /><br />After Thibault returns home, he decides to go and search for the girl in the picture. There are very few clues in the picture, but he eventually finds her. Not telling her about the picture, he applies for a job with Elizabeth, who is not only a teacher, but she also helps her grandmother with their dog kennel. Thibault also learns that not only has she been married before, but she also has a son. Will Thibault be able to tell Elizabeth about the picture or will he even be able to deal with all that Elizabeth has on her plate?<br /><br />The Lucky One is a breezy book, to say the least. I've read a few of Nicholas Sparks' novels before, because my sister is a huge fan. To me, his books are too predictable, and that makes them boring to me. This one had such potential going in to it, but I could guess just about everything that happened. Now, I'm not saying this is a bad book, because it's not and it did have me drawn it, I just like books that have twists that you can't predict. Although, if you're a Nicholas Sparks fan, than I'm sure you'll love this one.<br /><br />reposted: [...]

1400063515|4.0|In the spirit of my review of Fooled by Randomness, and to avoid the polarization of opinions about Nassim Nicholas Taleb's writings, I will provide a selection of memorable quotes taken from The Black Swan.<br /><br />- Certain professionals, while believing they are experts, are in fact not. Based on their empirical record, they do not know more about their subject matter than the general population, but they are much better at narrating--or worse, at smoking you with complicated mathematical equations. They are also more likely to wear a tie.<br /><br />- I don't particularly care about the usual. If you want to get an idea of a friend's temperament, ethics, and personal elegance, you need to look at him under the tests of severe circumstances, not under the regular rosy glow of daily life. Can you assess the danger a criminal poses by examining only what he does on an ordinary day?<br /><br />- Scientists may be in the business of laughing at their predecessors, but owing to an array of human mental dispositions, few realize that someone will laugh at their beliefs in the (disappointingly near) future.<br /><br />- Consider a turkey that is fed every day. Every single feeling will firm up the bird's belief that it is the general rule of life to be fed every day by friendly members of the human race \\"looking out for its best interests,\\" as a politician would say. On the afternoon of the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, something unexpected will happen to the turkey. It will incur a revision of belief.<br /><br />- Like many of the skeptics I hang around with, Hume was jovial and a bon vivant, eager for literary fame, salon company, and pleasant conversation. His life was not devoid of anecdotes. He once fell into a swamp near the house he was building in Edinburgh. Owing to his reputation among the locals as an atheist, a woman refused to pull him out of it until he recited the Lord's Prayer and the Belief, which, being practical-minded, he did. But before he argued with her about whether Christians were obligated to help their enemies.<br /><br />- I was once taken aback when a doctor told me after a routine cancer checkup, \\"Stop worrying, we have evidence of cure.\\" \\"Why?\\" I asked. \\"There is evidence of no cancer\\" was the reply. \\"How do you know?\\" I asked. He replied, \\"The scan is negative.\\" Yet he went around calling himself doctor!<br /><br />- One Diagoras, a nonbeliever in the gods, was shown painted tablets bearing the portraits of some worshippers who prayed, then survived a subsequent shipwreck. The implication was that praying protects you from drowning. Diagoras asked, \\"Where were the pictures of those who prayed, then drowned?\\"<br /><br />- Plato believed that we should use both hands with equal dexterity. It would not \\"make sense\\" otherwise. He considered favoring one limb over the other a deformation caused by the \\"folly of mothers and nurses.\\" Asymmetry bothered him and he projected his ideas of elegance onto reality.<br /><br />- Karl Popper was once asked whether one \\"could falsify falsification\\" (in other words, if one could be skeptical about skepticism).

B000AOEMXM|5.0|The was the very first show that I started watching from day one. Most other shows I don't get into until I catch the reruns after they have been on a few years or more.  I loved this show, and it was by far my favorite new show while it was on. I was shocked when I heard they were canceling it after only four seasons. It could have easily gone seven seasons or more.  All four seasons are good and feature great acting, good special effects and some great storylines. There was clearly some more story lines they wanted to do and never got the chance.  I think the show was a product of some bad luck and timing. First of all it aired, at least locally for me, on an awful channel on which I watched nothing else. The channel did a poor job advertising this show and its other shows were mostly awful black comedies that seemed totally at odds with the nature of this show. Second, this was the fourth Star Trek show in a row, and I think the public was getting a bit burned out on the theme. Third, too many die hard Star Trek fans tuned out for some reason.  Ill-regardless, this was a great show. I found it to be the most realistic of the Star Trek shows. If you are a Sci-Fi fan and haven't seen this, you should definitely check it out.

The new epilogue is succinct and Dan's command of the English language is remarkable with unique wording  and phrases that will be used in many students papers for decades to come.  Reading the new one was like visiting an old friend.  I often see him on the business channels on TV as he is recognized as a worldwide expert on oil.  This is a treatise on world history from the perspective of oil by a truly brilliant observer.  Barry Reinhard
B00006CXSS|5.0|My wife summarized my feelings about this DVD series the best about a week after we finished the last DVD.  She said, \\"I wish I could keep watching more about them.  I feel like I know those guys, and now I miss them.\\"    I thought, what a testament to   (a) the power and impact that the \\"characters\\" had on us  (b) the performances of the actors  (c) the production team that put it all together.    Everyone undoubtedly knows the remarkable story of how these men bonded in during such a pivotal part of recent history. Their story makes for a very dramatic tale.  However, HBO, Hanks and Spielberg expertly weave Ambrose's book into a riveting account that grips the viewer, even a week after they finished watching.

B0015OKWL2|3.0|Being a fan of both Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino, it's hard not to like this film. The performances of both leads keep you interested, but I figured out the twist way before the end of the film. The film also seemed like a very long hour and a half. This is because the film really doesn't go anywhere or tell us anything we haven't known from the opening credits. It's a descent crime drama, but I expected more from these two silver screen giants. The DVD transfer looks very good with minimal extras.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|You can't help being a bit confused at this point. This is the 2nd of 3 re-issues of songs from the 1971 Fillmore concerts that made this band famous, and it has the exact same title of an album released in 2004, which should at least have been called Deluxe Edtion II. I think this is a result of the record companies belatedly catching up to the importance of this music, along with the inconvenient timing of digital technology. Here's the history:  1. The Allman Brothers At Fillmore East - original issue, double vinyl LP (September 1971, subsequently released in a 2 CD version, and an abriged single CD version)  2. The Fillmore Concerts - re-edited and re-mastered for CD, added songs (October 1992)  3. The Allman Brothers At Fillmore East (Deluxe Edition) - back to original edits with plus the new songs from the 1992 album plus \\"Midnight Rider\\" (and the issue this review is related to)  4. The Allman Brothers At Fillmore East (Deluxe Edition) - the original version, now in hybrid SACD format    For the true fan, there's something to be enjoyed in all of them. For the concert purist, 1992's The Fillmore Concerts is the one. For hi-fi fans, this SACD release is the one.
1592402038|5.0|Lynn Truss, a proud, self-proclaimed snobbish pedant, makes no bones about the fact that her short book, \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is really an extended essay on pedantry - a style book, a prescriptive grammar, a manifesto, a rant and, perhaps saddest of all, a eulogy - bemoaning the demise of the correct use of  punctuation in the written English word today.<br /><br />As a reader, writer and speaker who, frankly, takes pride in an extensive vocabulary and takes pains to use our magnificent language correctly, I found myself nodding vigorously in agreement as Truss eloquently spoke about the purpose of correct punctuation. She helps us to understand that commas, apostrophes, colons and the other denizens of our pantheon of punctuation marks are aids and signs on a road map for communication without misunderstanding. They are an invaluable assistance to reading out loud with the proper interpretation, lilt and intonation that an author intended in the same fashion as a well annotated musical score enables a musician to interpret music as a composer meant it to be played.<br /><br />\\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" also provides us with snippets of the history of punctuation. I wager that few of us were aware that the apostrophe first appeared as early as the 16th century.<br /><br />If history and a pedantic rant delivered with a school marm attitude, a baleful glare and a wrathful wagging finger were all we got from a reading of \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\", I'm sure most of us would have yawned in complete boredom and Lynn Truss's novel would not likely have reached the list of best sellers. But, thankfully, \\"Eats, Shoots and Leaves\\" is also liberally sprinkled with a very healthy dose of dry as dust British wit, humour and sarcasm that hit my funny bone with a full-sized mallet. One of my favourites was the story of a community group who had built an enormous playground for the children of their neighbourhood and advertised it with the sign \\"GIANT KID'S PLAYGROUND\\". To the amazement of the group that had built the facility, it was hardly ever used. Lynn Truss, with tongue in cheek, suggested it was probably because everyone was terrified of meeting the giant kid.<br /><br />By the way, the much maligned salesman of this review's title is actually a complete tee-totaller. He is, however, a very exceptional pickled-herring salesman! (If you'll forgive my mixed metaphors, a very different kettle of fish, indeed). This witty little example shows how the poor, lowly, and much misunderstood dash can eliminate any possibility of misunderstanding the sentence.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissthat had built the facility, it was hardly ever used.

B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog is one of the most delightfully funny movies I have seen in a long time.  Each song fits the characters, and the plot is full of wit.  Joss Whedon has done it again, creating a story and characters that you get attached to (or not in the case of Captain Hammer :)) quite quickly.<br /><br />Harris, Fillion, and Day were superb in their respective roles.  To be honest, I have the entire soundtrack on my iPod and I listen to it daily!!  I even bought copies for four family members for Christmas.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone!  Even if you aren't quite fond of musicals, you should give Dr Horrible a chance.  You won't regret it!
0743454537|5.0|Kate Fitzgerald is barely beyond infancy when she is diagnosed with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a rare and particularly robust and aggressive form of leukemia. The prognosis is bleak indeed and recovery is rarer than the cancer itself. When Kate's parents are faced with the urgent necessity to find a blood donor that is not just a match, but a perfect match, they set out to create a genetically matched sibling who will provide a perfectly matched, life-saving, blood-filled umbilicus upon her birth. The second daughter, whose blood saves Kate's life within seconds of her birth, is named Anna.<br /><br />But APL is a most persistent disease and when it re-occurs after a remission, a particular treatment is never successful a second time. Successive bulwarks of defense against the cancer's onslaught must, of necessity, involve progressively more aggressive medicine. As a result, the demands that are made of Anna to act as a donor become progressively more invasive, more time-consuming and more demanding as she grows older until, at the tender age of 13, she is faced with the requirement to provide a kidney for her sister whose organs are failing under APL's unremitting attack.<br /><br />Long frustrated with the fact that nobody has ever listened to her or consulted her with respect to the medical decisions that are centered around Kate, Anna approaches Campbell Alexander, a litigation attorney, and sues her parents for \\"medical emancipation\\", the right to make her own medical decisions and take command of her own body. Anna's mother, a former attorney, decides to represent her husband and herself at the trial.<br /><br />\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" is no different than any of Picoult's other novels in that it addresses issues in a non-judgmental fashion from a wide variety of perspectives without attempting to take sides or present pat answers that simply don't exist. \\"My Sister's Keeper\\" touches on genetic engineering; the insane demands made upon a parent's time and energy in dealing with children's illnesses; the extent to which children may act out for better or for worse in a demand for a parent's love and attention; the difficulty of determining whether a 13 year old minor is capable of making adult decisions about the medical disposition of her own body; the existence of boundaries to the demands a parent may make of a child; the differences between moral, ethical and legal rights.<br /><br />As I turned the pages faster and faster, getting closer to the end of the book and the closing of the trial, I realized that Picoult had very few pages left in which she could effectively wind up her story and resolve the issues which as yet remained entirely open. With a raised eyebrow, I wondered how she was going to achieve a writing feat I thought quite impossible with so few pages left in the story. But, manage it she did. A beautifully engineered surprise ending that will just about break your heart wraps up every thread in the story but leaves the novel's ability to provoke a reader's thought on the issues she raises completely intact.<br /><br />You can definitely count me a stand-up wildly clapping Jodi Picoult fan.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|For those who thought that Carrie Underwood ran a monopoly on the commercial scape of country music since her American Idol win in 2005, Taylor Swift comes and invades her monopoly. Taylor Swift was destined to bow huge after a number of inescapable singles from her debut album, TAYLOR SWIFT.  Perhaps only one single would have had to have bowed in order to secure the nearly 600,000 copies that FEARLESS sold in it's first week - \\"Teardrops on My Guitar\\". That aside, rather than suffering the sophomore effect on FEARLESS, FEARLESS builds upon the strengths of her debut, which makes it a 100% solid album.  The songwriting is strong, the vocals are great, and the production tends to be understated, which are perfect formula for a strong country album that can appeal to pop/urban music fans to an extent.<br /><br />\\"Fearless\\" proves to be a great title track and opener for FEARLESS.  The production is just right, absent of being too ornate or being underwhelming at the other extreme.  Vocally, Taylor Swift sounds fantastic.  The refrain is catchy, the songwriting top-notch, and everything seems to work greatly. What might be most advantageous about \\"Fearless\\" or FEARLESS as a whole is the fact that it is country, but there are enough pop/singer-songwriter concessions to make it crossover easily. \\"Fifteen\\" flows right along, just as easily as the great opener, \\"Fearless\\" did.  Again, it is country, but it isn't \\"traditionalist\\" country per say, which leaves room for the massive crossover appeals that Taylor Swift has seen with pop audiences. Again, songwriting is strong and Taylor Swift sounds great. And additive factor is that Swift doesn't try to candy-coat the fact that she is 19; she plays it up she has a huge commercial monster on her hand. She bats 1000 so far, just two songs into her sophomore follow-up to TAYLOR SWIFT.<br /><br />\\"Love Story\\" may not be quite as catchy as TAYLOR SWIFT's \\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\" (which I personally couldn't stop singing in my head), but it comes extremely close if it happens to miss the mark.  It proves to be the third straight capable performance from Swift on an album that you can instantly tell is one of the BEST released at the \\"tail-end\\" of 2008. Everything lays well, once again. 3 for 3; Brilliant choice for a first single.<br /><br />\\"Hey Stephen\\" gives Taylor Swift yet another song about 'a boy' under her belt.  Again, the restrained production only bodes in Swift's favor, allowing for the song to 'breathe', if you catch my drift.  Swift's songwriting and vocals become the focus as opposed to the production stealing the show. It makes for a pleasant, appealing listen. \\"White Horse\\", another inescapable single from the \\"wonder-kid\\", finds Swift singing a mid-tempo ballad. As with everything else, it is conservative and restrained, which widens it's appeal, despite being understated. Traces of piano, acoustic guitar, and drums utilizing brushes make for a polished, refined listen.<br /><br />\\"You Belong With Me\\" is as solid as anything else, proving to be catchy. It isn't necessarily the second-coming by any means, but it is a good, solid performance. \\"Breathe\\" featuring pop sensation Colbie Caillat, who seems to be making a lot of collaborative appearances lately, proves to be another worthwhile listen though it isn't a particularly exciting number per say. The main problem is despite its overall solidarity, \\"Breathe\\" comes over as a bit too lengthy. After \\"pedal-to-the-metal\\" numbers such as \\"Fearless\\" or \\"Love Story\\", it is a welcome, if somewhat underwhelming departure.<br /><br />\\"Tell Me Why\\" rediscovers any momentum lost by \\"Breathe\\" (which isn't much lost momentum) by casting this up-tempo number that has a bit more<br />'countrification' than some of FEARLESS's other tracks.  It plays out well and it's shorter duration (3:21) will be appreciated after the 4:25 of \\"Breathe\\".  It isn't as strong as the best of FEARLESS, but it is strong, which is the key. \\"You're Not Sorry\\" is atouching ballad starting with pulsing piano chords on the beat against Swift's fine vocals. It eventually adds a pop/country groove, intact with strings, guitar, and of course drums.  More exciting than \\"Breathe\\", \\"You're Not Sorry\\" is definitely one of FEARLESS' best ballads.<br /><br />\\"The Way I Loved You\\" proves to be a nice mid-tempo track, fully intact with solid songwriting and an ambient production backdrop supporting Swifts vocals. \\"Forever and Always\\" is another up tempo number, no so far removed from \\"Tell Me Why\\". It is solid, though it lacks the magic of the very best numbers of FEARLESS, which is an elite league including \\"Fearless\\", \\"Fifteen\\", \\"Love Story\\" and a couple of others.  However, there have been no misses whatsoever on FEARLESS, which is more than can be said about a lot of albums released in 2008.<br /><br />Penultimate track \\"The Best Day\\" proves to be another nice, restrained number, clearly a songwriter's styled song. Not as engaging as the best of FEARLESS, but just as potent.  \\"Change\\", the rollicking closing track puts a cap on a very fine album. Again, it isn't the \\"best of the best\\" or the \\"elite of the elite\\", but it is an accurate representation of why FEARLESS is such a strong outfit.<br /><br />Overall FEARLESS is a consistent, pleasant album.  It is not revolutionary, but then what is these days? What it is is a good solid country album that has a massive crossover potential unlike any country artists since well Ms. Underwood of course. Not perfect, but a very sound effort by all means on all cylinders. With that said, I give Taylor Swift my \\"critical blessing\\" with 4 stars.

0345495004|5.0|I can't believe I've only just now read this book when it seems to have been out there for quite some time!  Growing up in Chicago, very near Oak Park, it's impossible not to have some knowledge of Frank Lloyd Wright.  This brilliant first novelist takes all the facts and then weaves a tale that rings with truth about a life-altering chapter in Frank Lloyd Wright's life.  What you get isn't scandal but a real love story; two people who fall in love with significant consequences because it is, after all the turn of the century, and they are each already married with children.<br /><br />Get past that her name is Mamah (May-muh).  Miss Horan brings you firmly into the lives of FLW and his dear Mamah, who captivates him with her ability to catch his mind, as well as his eye.  The themes of allowing room and creating space for one's own inner self and soul to come to full bloom whether male or female, allowing that a woman can be brilliant irrespective of her roles as wife and mother, that a man can be both strong genius and vulnerable seeker of truth, are as fresh today as they were somewhat innovative then.  There are many books written about free thinkers who were trapped by the ideology of their time.  This book is about two who understood the ideology of the time but also managed to create a place for themselves in spite of it; and creating space was what FLW was all about.<br /><br />I won't say much more, other reviewers have well and better beat me to it.  What I will say is that this book is a journey well worth taking.  Miss Horan is a beautiful, lyrical writer.  Don't miss it!
B00140PK6O|5.0|I enjoyed this video very much. It portrayed what most women are really like. This is not a movie that men would enjoy but if you like small town living and the gossip that goes with it then you will enjoy this. I am only sorry that it does not continue as a series. The actresses and actors were very good.
B00129H7VS|4.0|Saw this series when it came out on TV and now bought the set - very good series and picture/sound quality is great.  Only downsides: - not sure they have cut out some of the pre/post scene interviews with the actual WWII participants that were originally included in the TV series - this always brought a slight tear to my eyes.  Most annoying feature - you have to sit through a seemingly endless screen of copywright warnings (in three languages) and other stuff before the scenes are actually loaded - with no ability to skip through them - a small annoyance in the scheme of things.

B000002OAZ|5.0|Howlin' Wolf is one of the genuinely iconic figures in the blues. I earlier reviewed \\"His Best\\" from Chess and thoroughly enjoyed that work. This is another fine recording, made special in some ways because of his backing players. Think about this: Eric Clapton on guitar, Steve Winwood on piano and organ, The Rolling Stones' rhythm section (Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman), the \\"sixth Stone\\"--Ian Stewart, Hubert Sumlin (Howlin' Wolf's own guitarist in his band), Jeffrey Carp on harmonica, Richie (Ringo Starr) on one cut when Charlie Watts was absent,  Klaus Voorman on bass and so on. Not too shabby!<br /><br />I do wish that \\"Back Door Man\\" (One of the Doors' hits with their cover of this song) had been included as well as \\"Moanin' at Midnight,\\" but these comments are just quibbles.<br /><br />To illustrate with a handful of the cuts on this CD:<br /><br />\\"Rockin' Daddy\\": Nice guitar work to start this off.  Then, the Wolf starts howlin'.<br /><br />\\"I can rock you all night long.\\"<br /><br />This is a nice rollicking song. The \\"all star\\" band supports Chester Barnett's singing well (that is his real name). Clapton's guitar playing is sparkling, but he does not overdo it and provides good support for the song itself. Watts and Wyman provide a solid rhythm base for the song.<br /><br />\\"Red Rooster.\\" There is an abortive start to this, which is delightful to listen to, as Howlin' Wolf and the band talk about how to play the song. The band members urge him to pick up his acoustic guitar to play. Then, to the actual performance of \\"The Red Rooster.\\" The Rolling Stones covered this, but the Wolf does a fine job here in his version of this Willie Dixon song. His vocal styling is terrific, even at his age when this was recorded.<br /><br />\\"Wang Dang Doodle\\" is another classic blues song. Another Willie Dixon composition, sung in Howlin' Wolf's inimitable style. Some typical lines:<br /><br />\\"We gonna wang dang doodle<br />All night long.\\"<br /><br />Great blues work from the backing band.<br /><br />\\"Tonight we need no rest,<br />We're really gonna do our best.\\"<br /><br />This is a fine Howlin' Wolf album. In the wrong hands, this could have been a disaster. But the musicians and producer focused on the music of Howlin' Wolf rather than the all-star band itself. Quite satisfying!est.\\"    This is a fine Howlin' Wolf album. In the wrong hands, this could have been a disaster.

006054094X|5.0|This is an excellent read and historically significant.  This changes everything that we learned growing up.     This book is not just fact and dull history.  This is record of what and how Gavin Menzies used, found, studied and analyzed to derive the story that unfolds throughout the book.     All too often historians feed us their thoughts or conclusions as fact.  Not Gavin Menzies.  I feel like I have been a part of his reseach and got to follow and look over his shoulder.

B001LRJH0U|4.0|Last year I saw a trailer for Appaloosa, the cinematic adaptation of Robert B. Parker's western novel, directed by Ed Harris, starring Harris and Viggo Mortensen. This trailer got me very excited, as I've been a huge fan of Parker's for a very long time, I love westerns, and Ed Harris is not only a damn fine actor but a superior director as well (proven in 2000's Pollock). And Viggo's no slouch either, nor is Jeremy Irons, who's also in the film.<br /><br />But Appaloosa had actually sat unread on my shelf for a couple of years because Parker's previous foray into the old West, Gunman's Rhapsody (a novel about Wyatt Earp, one of my favorite historical figures), had been a disappointment. I'd intended to get to it (thus the fact it was on the shelf at all), but hadn't yet. Since I generally prefer to read a book before seeing the movie it inspires, I immediately rescued Appaloosa from its lonely spot and dove in.<br /><br />Short review: the book's awesome. These old West peacekeepers walk the same metaphorical mean streets as Parker's other tough guys, like Spenser, Hawk, and Jesse Stone, dusty as the streets in the town of Appaloosa may be. The familiar Parker themes are all here, the honor and friendship between men, the unflagging devotion to a woman loved (even when it's probably not deserved), the violent life lived according to a code...and all that stuff works perfectly in this milieu. Additionally, as Parker himself has aged, his treatment of these themes has deepened; there is more of a sense of human fallibility in his characters these days, and the codes they live by don't always serve them well.<br /><br />Finishing the book, I was even more jazzed about the movie. But for various reasons, I didn't manage to get out to see it in the theater, so my excitement shifted to the day it was due on DVD (and, more importantly to me with my PS3, Blu-Ray), which was this past Tuesday.<br /><br />I watched it, and really enjoyed it, though it doesn't ascend to the level of some other westerns in recent years, like 2007's dynamite remake of 3:10 to Yuma. It's full of great performances, very true to the novel, gorgeously shot, and every detail onscreen is researched and thought out, from the stamped tin stars worn by the lawmen to the varying architectural styles of a frontier town built piecemeal over time by people of differing cultural backgrounds. It's not an action film, maintaining the low-key and straightforward tone and pace of Parker's novel, and ultimately works best as a character drama rather than an adventure story. To some, it may actually be too realistic for a good western. To others, it may rise above other films in the genre for that very reason.<br /><br />Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen have incredible chemistry, both laconic but Harris very stolid and forthright while Mortensen's more playful and ironic. Jeremy Irons is, go figure, a great villain, but beyond that, he is such a perfect western bad guy it's amazing he's never been in one before. The cast beyond them is full of great character actors like Lance Henriksen, Timothy Spall, and James Gammon, who all bring their characters vividly to life. The only role I'd have cast differently was Allie: Renee Zellweger doesn't really bring much to the character.<br /><br />The book was more satisfying overall, though I have little doubt I'd have enjoyed the film more had I not read the book first. Still, I did really like the movie, and it put me back in the mood to read Parker's follow-up books, Resolution and Brimstone.<br /><br />One odd note, especially considering the incredible effort Harris and his team put into making a film so authentic to its period, was that as the credits roll, a Tom Petty (Mudcrutch) song starts to play. It's a fine enough tune, but I hate when Hollywood does this. It just doesn't fit. Then, as is my wont, I let the credits play, and after the Petty tune, another more appropriate song started up, and I instantly recognized the voiceof the singer: Ed Harris. I watched the credits to see if I was right, and sure enough, the song \\"You'll Never Leave My Heart\\" was not only sung by Harris, it was co-written by him. And while Harris's rough performance doesn't reach Johnny Cash levels, he does hover in Robert \\"Thunder Road\\" Mitchum territory, and fares far better than Lee \\"Born Under A Wanderin' Star\\" Marvin. Not only was the song absolutely appropriate for the film, unlike the Petty, it was good enough I now have it on my iPod.f I was right, and sure enough, the song \\"You'll Never Leave My Heart\\" was not only sung by Harris, it was co-written by him.

0757302661|5.0|When I was 7 months pregnant, I started panicking about my impending labor. I had heard wonders about this method, so I bought the book. It was a lifesaver! It made me realize that childbirth is not supposed to be the excruciantingly painful experience we are expected to go through. Those fears are fueled by religion (the Bible, anyone?) and cultural and social beliefs. Once your fears are eased and you have a better understanding of your body and labor, then you can work on the meditation, breathing and massage. To make a long story short, I was able to control the pain so well (I was even wondering if I was in labor!) that I did not need any pain medication. By the time I was feeling very uncomfortable and somewhat in pain, it was time to push. My ob/gyn and the nurses were amazed and my son was alert and healthy from the moment he was born. I did not have any of the rather unpleasant side effects from anesthesia or interventions. My mom was shocked...I was the kind of girl who would faint at the sight of a needle! If I can do this, so can you!

Ingenious! There is also a standard commentary track as well as a featurette on the making of this jewel. There was also the inclusion of fan created video applications to the Evil League of Evil.

0307455874|2.0|I like to read a lot of books and I read very fast, but this book is a drag.     Obama is not swayed by facts and research. He has his ideas and he knows that most of his audience lacks the sophistication to understand the consequences of political decisions. For this reason, in his book he will weave a large set of platitudes with some light personal stories.     Read the book and please tell me if you can explain in 500 words what you found out about Obama.     However I gave the book 2 stars because, it is true, Obama can express his ideas in such convoluted ways that it's easy to forget that he is 100% in disagreement with you.      Obama is the person who can say that he thinks that there should be common sense anti-gun laws and believe in the second amendment in the same sentence.     What I don't understand is why a lot of people (most of them endowed with a slower processor than myself) can fall head over heels for these  sophisticated platitudes. What is also interesting is to see somebody who twists and turns its discourse in such windy way that whatever comes out, appears plausible.     Obama wastes no time with theory, with actual assumption, implications and  testing of his ideas. What he does instead is to provide some historical background, expose a lot of positives for his ideas, few negatives, while for the opposing camp has few positives (to appear unbiased) and a lot of disadvantages. He is very manipulative in basically capturing the reader in believing his story. In fact, reading his book, you will rarely, if ever, be able to understand his position on the issue. He just wants to appear a \\"good guy\\".    But he isn't. I suggest you read the first chapter of Freddoso's book: the case Against Barack Obama. I read only the first chapter of the book and the image of corruption in Illinois made my head spin. Obama is a manipulative social climber. He became the Illinois senator in 1996 by disqualifying his opponents.      Obama's approach in the bookis light and unscientific. On page 179 for example he explains why he is against privatizing Social Security. He claims that those who came late, before a company collapses are left with the losses. That is true, but it's also true that individual citizens, left to do what is good for them, make decisions and learn from their mistakes.   Most of the problems that America faces now come from fixing a non issue at the time in exchange for votes of those who benefit from but don't pay for the particular law. Those who are afraid of the market can buy gold, treasuries etc, while those who like to gamble can buy upstarts or other risky assets.     Obama is an old cliche socialist in fancy clothes.

0553577123|5.0|I left the title of the review blank because I am lost for words. I first read this when I was 13 years old myself, and laughed with Anne, cried with Anne and loved with Anne with the optimism and passions of a fellow 13 year old teenage girl. And now, reading it again as a woman, I marvel at Anne Frank; her values, beliefs, curiosity and passions mark her out as a person of incredible personal strength and optimism. In one entry she wrote how she couldn't wait to go to the public library after the war to look for books, and Anne's ability to believe in the goodness of human beings in the worst of times is something we could all learn from. When I closed the book for the second time in my life, I cried. I felt I had lost a friend whom I loved for her strength, wit, humour, intelligence, a friend who I came to respect on my second reading of her diary. Anne Frank made an impression on those who knew her while she lived. And no one will forget her in her death. This book is one of the most important books of our times, and I am sure I will pick this book up again, to learn the new lessons Anne teaches her readers at every reading.
B000002H3E|4.0|Dokken's first release after their breakthrough was a decidedly more commercial affair, aimed at the top forty. 'Under Lock and Key' was not a disappointment when I purchased it some twenty odd years ago but I could sense that more people would hear about this band. MTV definitley seized on \\"In My Dreams\\" which seemed tailor made for the hair-metal revolution they were heavily promoting, soaring harmonies and power chords. \\"The Hunter\\", \\"It's Not Love\\" and lead track \\"Unchain the Night\\" would further cement Dokken's reputation for radio and chick friendly hard rock with a serious metal virtuoso in George Lynch and volitile personal animosity between Lynch and band leader Don Dokken. \\"Slippin' Away' is a failed attempt to recreate the magic of \\"Alone Again\\" while \\"Jaded Heart\\" was the much better example of the power ballad (\\"Slippin' is just too cheesy). For the real metal monster of the record, \\"Til the Living End\\" does the best to remind people that what made 'Tooth and Nail' the better record was that it was much more metal than 'Under'. I really like this record but I don't agree that it is Dokken's best...too many concessions to the pop crowd...not enough for the denim and leather one.

0765315246|5.0|In an obvious nod to Glory Road (Heinlein), Scalzi introduces a different universe exposed to us by a 75 year old turned competent warrior (I guess the stories of incompetent warriors tend to be short stories).    While this book is set in a military setting, it doesn't have the same feel as other military sci-fi, which I enjoyed. It does have both a good deal of humor and allusions to other literature, which made for a pleasant read.    I stayed up late last night reading it (second night in a row, second Scalzi book in a row).
015206396X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and was terribly disappointed that since it was the author's debut novel and had only just come out in October that there was nothing else by Kristin Cashore for me to read.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters in this novel and much of the action was really driven by them.  Katsa is the king's niece and a Graceling, one who is very skilled in one thing.  When Katsa was young she unintentionally killed a cousin of hers and was marked with the Grace of killing.  She is unhappy with the distinction the Grace gives her and sought for many years to train herself and keep her Grace under control.  Katsa is a character that while self-assured of herself in some ways is desperately unsure of herself in others.  Like so many other heroines in popular YA books right now Katsa is afraid of the power within herself and of changing the status quo.  Despite that Katsa is unhappy with her status of court bully and seeks to change things outside of her sphere with the Council.<br /><br />It's on one of the missions for the Council that Katsa meets Po, a prince from the island kingdom of Lienid and a Graceling himself.  Po tells her that his Grace lies in fighting - any of the hand-to-hand combats.  Katsa has been basically undefeatable as a fighter for many years and enjoys the chance to use her skills to their fullest against him.  It is an unlikely start, but theirs becomes a true friendship that weathers a multitude of trials.<br /><br />Politics play a huge role in this novel (rather like in the Poison Study books by Maria Snyder or Crown Duel by Sherwood Smith) but augment the novel by forcing the characters to move faster, take leaps and create bonds.  The politics of the Seven Kingdoms are what drive the characters to take action.<br /><br />I can't wait to see what's next from this author.

B000002KDO|4.0|REVIEW: Wait a minute! I thought this was supposed to be a Satanic/black metal kind of band!?!! But with lyrics like \\"Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say/if they knew you believe in God above. They should realize before they criticize/that God is the only way to love.\\", \\"Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone. Open your eyes, just realize that He is the one. The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate...or will you still jeer at all you hear?\\", and \\"Your world was made for you by someone above/but you choose evil ways instead of love.\\": Black Sabbath shows that they have just as much to say about the goodness of Christ as they do about the evil of Satan. And even though some may balk at the pot smoking endorsement of \\"Sweet Leaf\\": for certain the rest of the album is completely free of offense. \\"After Forever\\", \\"Children Of The Grave\\", \\"Lord Of This World\\", and even the escapist sci-fi/fantasy of \\"Into The Void\\" are pro-life, pro-love, pro-God, pro-Christ, and anti-Satan. In fact, it is the quiet \\"Planet Caravan\\"-esque ballad \\"Solitude\\" that is the lone downer of the collection: yet it is so beautiful and haunting that it makes you feel sorry for the poor fellow as he weeps for the girl who just walked out of his life. Add to that a couple of charming instrumental interludes (the so-so \\"Embryo\\" and the lovely guitar piece \\"Orchid\\"), and you've got a near-masterpiece of heavy metal. For certain vocalist Ozzy Osbourne, bassist Geezer Butler, drummer Bill Ward, and ace axe-man Tommy Iommi do themselves proud by showing the world that their breakout release \\"PARANOID\\" was no one-trick pony of an LP. Bravo guys.      HIGHEST BILLBOARD ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 8.    HIT SINGLES: None.
B001LRJH0U|3.0|\\"Appaloosa\\" is less a classic Western than a character drama set in the New Mexico Territory of 1882. Actor Ed Harris directs, stars in the film, co-produces, and co-wrote the script with Robert Knott,  based on the novel by Robert B. Parker. Virgil Cole (Ed Harris) and Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen) are lawmen for hire whose no-nonsense manner and quick guns have served their dozen-year partnership well. The town of Appaloosa turns to Cole and Hitch after the scoundrel Randall Bragg (Jeremy Irons) murders their Marshall and his deputies rather than allow two of his henchmen to be arrested. As the duo attempt to rid the town of Bragg's menace and secure evidence against him, a flirtatious widow, Allie French (Renee Zellweger) arrives in town and catches Virgil's eye.<br /><br />Unlike classic Westerns, \\"Appaloosa\\" is not allegory, or, if it was, that was lost in translation to the screen. It's a chapter in the relationship between Virgil and Everett, both laconic, introverted men who seem most comfortable with solitude -or with each other. Virgil is the less educated and less smart of the two, but he knows his stuff and recognizes that Everett's one weakness is that he has feelings. It would be an intriguing relationship if there were more of it, but \\"Appaloosa\\" only scratches the surface. The villain, Randall Bragg, is poorly drawn. Why is he at odds with the townspeople? Why would he take such risks to protect a couple of irredeemably criminal ranch hands? These questions are answered in a prologue that was cut from the film. While I agree that the prologue is awkward, the information needs to be incorporated somewhere in order for the story to make sense.<br /><br />Jeremy Irons is underutilized and doesn't have enough screen time to make Bragg interesting or menacing. Virgil and Everett's friendship is interesting. Allie, a sort of bourgeois whore, is interesting. It's interesting when the protagonists must join their enemies in a common cause. But everyone is adrift in a script that doesn't focus on any one thing. Some sequences are quite good, but an underwritten, apparently unmotivated villain who is scarcely seen is insufficient to arouse the audience's interest in the basic conflict.

1582406723|4.0|The series (which does get a lot better) starts of with a police standoff. Rick Grimes and his partner Shane are shooting at a man with a man in a truck with a rifle. The man takes a well-aimed blow, and hits Shane in the hand, knocking his gun out the same hand. The second shot, which Shane cannot now deflect, hits Rick right in the guts.<br /><br /> Rick then wakes up in a hospital. He searches around. When he gets to the cafeteria, he opens the door, (which had been locked for a reason) only to find it filled to the brim with the dead. Well, living dead. Turns out, he'd been in a coma for about a month. And so begins Image's epic The Walking Dead.<br /><br /> Yes, the first volume is the worst (so far, I'm only on volume 5) but it is a good beginning. And it is the volume that deals the most with the actual zombies. (As you read farther into the series, the zombies become a sort of backdrop, and a more sinister sort of villain takes place: how far would you go to survive?)<br /><br /> There are many characters in this series, and that's the sole problem with it. Like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, there are too may characters! The later volumes do what needs to be done though; they'll devote an issue (the volumes collect 4-5 issues of the monthly series) to a small group of characters, switching off between the many seen throughout the whole series.<br /><br /> Although this is the worst volume (still is 4 stars!!!) the series works out it's problems later, proving to be an amazing series not just about zombies, but about the essence of mankind itself. Grade: A-.
B0017ANAZO|4.0|A movie made up of an all-female cast and i mean ALL-female, there was not a man in site even in the extras now that's genius.<br />The cast is made up of the always convincing Meg Ryan, the brilliant Annette Bening, Debra Messing added some laughs and Jada Pinkett Smith like you have never seen her before.<br />The story-line is not a particularly new one but to the movie's defense it has been relevant in the past, is relevant now and will be relevant in the future, perfect husband turns out to be NOT so perfect. The way this problem is tackled by the women and the different points of view of each of the women is definitely interesting. The loyalty and friendship of this cast is believable the chemistry is great.<br />The movie is full of laughs and great lines. It is definitely refreshing to see an all-female cast, Hollywood should keep this up.
B00005JN8Z|5.0|A little while ago today I just got the 2-disc DVD and gave it a quick look over. It's been a LONG wait. The agony is over. Now the pleasure begins!    No need to say much about this epic masterpiece itself. Just DVD stuff here, quick & dirty.    First off, Miklos Rozsa's Overture and Exit music are returned to their rightful places. They do not disappoint. Finally, things are intact. I am relieved that there are people at WB who care about such vital details and can make them happen.    The 'Making Of' featurette is very welcome to fans like me, but even at about 45 minutes, it seems short. I would rather have seen more production clips and photos than seeing the faces of the interviewees, but they were all credible and respectful. I was delighted to see how much director Mervyn LeRoy was acknowledged and appreciated - at last. John Huston is one of the greats, but I agree that he would have been wrong for 'QV'. LeRoy, long underappreciated as a director, really pulled off a stupendous achievement, which is obvious. There should have been more info on producer Sam Zimbalist. No mention of cameramen Surtees and Skall, or much about the art direction, though there was a good bit about FX artist Peter Ellenshaw. Liz Taylor's cameo isn't mentioned, either. On the whole though, an excellent documentary on a subject where anything at all is welcome.    Haven't heard F.X. Feeney's commentary during the picture yet, but in the documentary, he seems a decent pick.    One of the points made was that with DeMille's 'Samson and Delilah', 'QV' launched the '50s-'60s epic film cycle. I would add Henry King's 'David and Bathsheba', also from '51, in the mix. Not as spectacular, but just as meaningful. And its score, by Alfred Newman, is just as important and influential as Rozsa's for 'QV'.     The original trailers (2 of them) are classy and exciting, to say the least. MGM went all out. In the main trailer, the approach is almost scholarly. No trace of kitsch.    I have always wondered why MGM never inserted an intermission. Approximately the final third is on Disc 2, so viewers can fake an intermission, (though without Rozsa accompaniment!). I read somewhere that because of the high resolution of the restoration, the coding takes up more DVD space, but it could be because there wasn't enough extra stuff to make a second disc indispensable, so they stretched it over two anyway.    But what the heck - I'm just ecstatic to see this magnificent picture returned to glory, and that there are a lot of people who care about it. Thank you WB Home Video!    Only tech reservation: the first sequences look a bit washed out, but maybe it's just my monitor. Have yet to mount it on TV.
0802798233|4.0|At Chicago suburban Fairfield High School, chemistry teacher Mrs. Peterson makes popular senior cheerleader Brittany Ellis and gangbanger newcomer Alejandro \\"Alex\\" Fuentes lab partners.  From the opening introduction by each of the other to the class, sparks fly.  They detest the other's lifestyle, but both relish that it is game time.<br /><br />Alex bets his friends he will own Brittany before the year is out.  She, in turn avoids him as she has a perfect reputation going out with the star QB and hiding her less than ideal family from her schoolmates.  As they are forced to work together, she realizes he is more than just a hood from the hood and he concludes she is more than a mall rat.  Soon rumors fly that they are an entry, which to the shock of each they want to be, but who will risk admitting the truth re their feelings.<br /><br />This is a heated young adult romance starring two seemingly opposites falling in love.  The story line is amusing but also has some hotter than usual scenes including Brittany losing her virginity.  Although Alex never comes across as a gangbanger nor do his friends, fans will enjoy the romance between him and Brittany as each learns the other has turf issues and dreams.  Together they make PERFECT CHEMISTRY.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner

0312383320|5.0|Honestly I don't know how anyone could not LOVE the world of Stephanie Plum. Even if you've never read the other novels you could love this one.    It's full of food, a big bad wolf, farting, and all of our favorite plum-universe characters. Friends, Janet Evanovich has surely done it again. I really liked the longer (about 300pgs) format, and LOVED that Ranger & Morelli appear more than the usual 1 sentance the other books have. Lula is hilarious as always, Stephanie and Diesel have their work cut out for them... and it's plum fabulous.    I won't say more because really- I wouldn't want to take the joy away from you of reading it yourself. Go get a tastycake and enjoy. Oh- and be ready to laugh- I know I did!
B001GKJ2FW|2.0|Most reviews were so good that I expected to be blown away by this movie.  Image quality was not good at all.  I thought maybe I had turned off the 1080 setting - but my settings were correct.  Acting was good, but this was a musical - and other than the daughter's voice, all others were forgettable.  I've watched Phantom more than half a dozen times... I won't waste my time watching Mama Mia again.

Bottom line is this, if you want a good steak then you're gonna go to the last place where you had a good steak. It's consistency people. Slayer sounds like Slayer...again. Their last two discs didn't sound like Slayer...they sounded more like a turd hitting the frozen layer of ice in the porto-let that you were forced to use cause there was no where else to go in the middle of a snow storm. You get the picture. Slayer is Slayer again...gosh I'm happy...if my Big Mac lost it's sesame seed bun, I might not want my Big Mac anymore.
B0018CWWLE|5.0|This is an excellent DVD by an excellent band. I do want to address those who talked of voices aging. This is natural. If songs have to be done in a lower key - this is a fact of life. Stephen Stills has been quoted as saying that he, David Crosby, Graham Nash and Neil Young were preparing to tour. This was about 8 years ago. They had a concern with high notes. Steven happened to mention this to Tony Bennett and asked if it was okay to change keys. Bennett started laughing and, according to Stills, said:  \\"Do you really think I sing \\"I Left My Heart in San Francisco\\" in the same key that I did 40 years ago?\\"    They are here and able to perform well. Be thankful and enjoy.
0156030209|5.0|Martel conveys a wonderful entertaining story of Pi Patel who survives out at sea for over 270 days when the cargo ship his family, their zoo animals and him sinks in the Pacific. Pi Patel practices Christianity, Hindu and Islamic religious practices and the story becomes a curious walk through faith and how Pi uses combines three major religions in pursuit of god.    The first part of the book covers Pi's life in his father's zoo and how he came to adopt first Christianity and the Islam. The majority of the book though recounts Pi's survival on a lifeboat with a 450-lb Bengal tiger, a zebra, hyena and orangutan. Pi's journey and struggle with the animals on his boat is masterfully told and will keep the reader enthralled.    I found this an excellent book both as a story and a unique view on religion and god.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|We have so far thoroughly enjoyed the fourth season of Lost DVD. We have watched the bonus features, and they were very interesting, funny and enjoyable. Being big Lost \\"fanatics\\", of course the episodes are great, but these bonus features were great!!
031606792X|5.0|As a rule, I generally don't review books because every review is completely subjective of how the reader likes or dislikes a book. After reading some of the bad reviews on this book, I felt the need to weigh in and lend my 5 stars of support to Stephanie Meyer for a book that I enjoyed immensely.     Like most other Twilight saga readers, I greedily read through the 4 book series and then reread some of them 2-3 times. Since vampires are not a subject that I would generally read, my husband thinks its funny how much I love these books...especially after all the sci-fi jokes he receives from me. But after my daughter (12) received the first book from a friend, I wanted to read it to check out the content. After that, I was hooked.    I'm not going to give point by point debate like many other reviewers, I will only offer that I don't know when my attention has been so entirely captured as it was for this series. I was also pleasantly surprised by the ending. I don't think I know of a Vampire story that has a good ending so I would commend Stephanie Meyer in going against mainstream thought and trying to find a way to make things work out and everyone get along. It's a shame we can't apply those same principle to every day life.    Anyway, I just want to send out a big thanks to the author for a series of books that were filled with love, suspense, and action.
1582701709|5.0|I take exception to the detrators who say that this book rehashes things that we learned in Kindergarden. The truth is people are people and they forget alpt of \\"Stuff\\". Yes they should remember how to lead a smart life, be a better person, make more money and maybe even be a Rocket Scientist. I like the Law of Attraction. I like things that give me hope and promise a better life.

068987474X|4.0|Quick read - only 150+ pgs - let's face it - this book was not intended to be some sort of deep psychological feminist awakening - if it were, it would not have a cutesy pink cover and it would have a lot more than 150+ pages and it would have been co-written by someone with a PHD.  Please rate the book for it's intended purpose - a straightforward dating guide for the single woman.  If you are happily married, skip it and move on OR read it and remind yourself to be exceptionally grateful for the guy you chose to entitle \\"husband.\\"  My two favorite lines from Mr. Behrendt are \\"Don't waste the pretty\\" and \\"I chose love the verb, not the noun.\\"  If Mr. Behrendt were to write 150+ pgs about how the woman he chose to marry inspired him to actually take the plunge and get married, I don't think it would hold the attention of a single woman for all that long, do you?  It's intended audience is SINGLE, remember?  Instead, he and Ms. Tuccillo chose to select a \\"dear Greg\\" format using the most common of excuses single women use to delay the inevitable in less than desirable relationships.  You get out of a relationship what you are BOTH willing to put into it.  So if there's only one willing participant, move on.  I think the authors did a great job of driving this point home, keeping it brief, keeping it engaging, and keeping it real.  Ms. Tuccillo's responses to Greg's advice have echoed the sentiments of ladies I have personally met, both professionally and personally.  Her \\"I've been there\\" attitude helped to soften Behrendt's sharp advice and made the material all that much more relatable.  BTW, this is certainly not my \\"type\\" of book to read, but I read it b/c a single friend mentioned she really enjoyed it and there's a movie out now...with actors I admire....so what the heck I figured...let this 30-something, 15+ year married, 10+ year mom, read a book that has nothing to do with her life at the moment. Sure I sped-read quite a few pages, but nonetheless, let's not discredit something just because it doesn't represent our current stage in life at the moment.discredit something just because it doesn't represent our current stage in life at the moment.

Movie moved pretty quickly, had some funny lines, and was pretty over the top in mocking war movies.  The cast works well together, but the thing that really carried the movie was Tom Cruise as the foul mouthed producer.  He pretty much stole the show.  Might not be worth buying but is definately worth renting or a Netflix slot.

B00009MGQL|5.0|I'm thumbing through the bins in 2003 with no particular purpose and little expectation.  I just stopped in on my way home from work, hoping for something interesting to jump out at me. It happened so seldom any more to this  fiftyish guy who still has a thousand vinyl records pre 1986 and no turntable-when the in store music caught my ear.  About the third time it caught my ear it was near the end of the disc and I decided, holy dung, this album is great! Finally something modern I can sink my teeth in to. So I schlepped up to the 70's version of myself at the counter and asked what it was. That figures! Jeff Beck. I have Wired and Blow by Blow gathering dust in the basement. I confess I bought those because it was hot in the circle I travelled in, but personally, it never got hold of me-shocking for a lot of you, I know. All I can say is buy it. You won't find Jeff Beck at your county fairgrounds playing his first 2 albums into the nursing home, like most 70's groups.  Beck is an evolving creature. Even if the names in my collection seldom change, I'm glad one or two of them is growing new fruit and not squeezing the daylights out of 30 year old stuff.

I don't remember it being available on all the numerous greatest hits and compilations albums for Aretha, but this song should have been right up there with the rest of her standards. The song is a blues-torch song with Aretha whooping and hollering like only she can and really proves that the title of the album was more than just a name.<br /><br />There are four bonus tracks including the long version of \\"Chain Of Fools\\" with spoken intro. And there's updated liner notes from David Nathan and the original liner notes from Jon Landau of Rolling Stone magazine.<br /><br />If you don't already own it, buy LADY SOUL now and you'll understand why Rolling Stone Magazine named her the greatest singer of all time.

0307269752|5.0|The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is one of the more satisfying books I've read in a while.<br /><br />TGWTDT is a tightly written, forward-moving murder mystery that effectively blends a who-done-it plot with family drama, corporate espionage, flawed characters, a bit of atypical sexual practices and, of course, a love story.  The result is a pleasantly surprising page turner that keeps you guessing along the way.  And you'll find yourself rooting for the two main characters to connect on a level that transcends physical, but you'll be wondering all the while if they are emotionally able to do so.  You may be surprised.<br /><br />The only down side is that TGWTDT is a story of a large Swedish family.  Consequently, there are a lot of people, and relationships/history, with which the reader must keep straight.  And, the fact that the names are likely more common in Sweden than in the U.S. doesn't make the job any easier.  Fortunately the author/publisher inserted a nice little family-tree diagram in the beginning to aid the reader in this task.<br /><br />Also, though the very ending (I'm talking the last 10 pages) was anticipated it was not very satisfying.<br /><br />In all, a very enjoyable read that had me reluctant to put it down, and anxious to pick it up.<br /><br />FYI - the author died before publication.  However, he apparently submitted two additional manuscripts at the time he submitted TGWTDT.  Knopf is planning on publishing both.  In fact, The Girl Who Played with Fire is scheduled for release July 2009.

The trilogy of commercial works which began with \\"Permanent Vacation\\" and moved on to \\"Pump.\\" While each of those albums had a few great songs and a bunch of other filler tracks. \\"Get A Grip\\" was packed with radio friendly and video friendly singles. Song after song took them to stardom far beyond the \\"classic rock\\" legends they had become. After 1993 they never looked back. They were mega stars that found themselves in movies, TV and all around Hollywood callings. While it gave us good rock n roll songs and one unforgettable album, it sadly moved them into the arena of taking themselves \\"too serious!\\" An end to one era and the beginning of another.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I cannot stop watching this movie.  With each viewing I  exerience MORE delightful moments.  The acting, Singing, humor and background is incredible.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|Since Alain Resnais and Roman Polanski, no other director has dealt with such delirious commitment the frenetic obsessions, the worlds bellow other worlds, the dream covering other dreams, with such brilliant resolutions than David Lynch.<br /><br />He had bet previously for other films with narrow resemblances such as Mulholland Drive. Once again, Lynch returns to the field in which is a king. The inner demons of the human being, the sharp game of metaphors, narrative ellipsis, sinister nightmares that happen in the most bizarre stages, keeping as superb landscape the main factory of dreams around the world: Hollywood.<br /><br />A young and talented actress is hired to play the main role into a filmic project that never was finished due weird circumstances. She is in love with his husband but she hides a dark background; a terrible secret and this magisterial script blends the bitter and unsaid reality, the fiction of the very script and the enigmatic presence of an old woman who meets herself as a neighbor, gifted of  dark visions.<br /><br />Lynch really involves us onto this complex web of livings, fears, obsessions and unsolved traumas, mixing them with glamour, sophistication, pink tunes, dances, acidic humor and sinister hallucinations where the big screen overtly works out as a huge mirror where she as actress may be seen herself from the spectator's hall.<br /><br />An intelligent and engaging visual tour de force, where everything fits admirably. The superb illumination, the arresting stages, the handle of camera and the way he employs Hollywood Boulevard not precisely as a gentle postcard, really deserve the best epithets as one of the greatest artistic American achievements of this raising century.
0375826726|5.0|All things considered I though this was a wonderful addition to the Inheritance Cycle, no longer trilogy . Taking note of the third book turning into to two different books has, I think, a lot to with how this book turned out. For me it was passed about the same as Eldest, which at times was dreadful but I suppose everything happens for a reason a Paolini's books. As far as what others say about to much violence, I look at it the same as the Harry Potter series. A war is being fought, book four is the conclusion to that war. Things are getting messy and at this point seems they can only get worse before they get better.     I thought over all it was an excellent book! Can not wait for the fourth!
B001DSNEJM|4.0|Supported by a smart script, the basic dramatic premise resides into rehabilitating missed existences of human beings who instead of having been sending to a better life, are sent to a dark Valley where the apparently redemption sense is masked of a merciless analysis of the human being under certain and prefixed conditions, where memory, feelings and all the emotional universe may supposedly be arranged and shifted for their own sake.<br /><br />What they didn't prevent is how the last human specimen would be far to react according the theory. A man of dark background who once was released understood and assimilated the value of the family as life's project. That feeling will be the key liberator that will break the impossed laws.<br /><br />A cult film since its immediate release.
B001HR5AIC|5.0|Seems everyone is familiar with Amy Winehouse and her brilliant 'Back to Black' album. While not in the same league, 'Frank' is nevertheless a great record in it's own right. This package is simply stunning. An oversized hardcover book style CD box with the 2 disc versions of each album. Also includes a deluxe 38 page booklet. Grab it if you can.
0545128285|3.0|Very short book. The end of the book says that it is an \\"early reader book\\". The problem is that it seems pointless without having read the real Harry Potter books, but they all seemed to be aimed at older kids or adults. So, who would enjoy this book?    I can't see how adults would get anything out of it. It was about an hour of reading, and there was nothing to it. It seemed like an idea she had but wasn't willing to put any time into writing it.    The only reason I even give it 3 stars is that I am not a kid, so maybe I just missed something.
1401207928|5.0|I thought the movie version of this graphic novel by Alan Moore was decent but believe me, reading this novel is a much better experience. It goes far beyond anything seen in the film and has a much different ending, so even if you've seen the film you'll still love this story. Like all of Alan Moore's works, the story is complex and builds to the final pages with a great payoff. V really is one of the most unique characters in modern fiction, and this book even includes some extras in the back, including an interview with Alan Moore and some early concept art and promotional work. If you haven't read this novel, buy it, if you've read it in the past spring for the hardcover because you'll want to read it many more times in the future.
0385333846|3.0|It seems that Kurt Vonnegut couldn't decide which book he was writing. It was a mix of sci-fi, drama, and humor. About 10 pages were about the fire bombing of Dresden. The rest of the book was pointless drivel to build up to the ten pages he seemed to really want to write.     I often found myself thinking, \\"oh, that was supposed to be funny\\". It wasn't really. I think a couple lines were mildly humorous.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|The dvd I received was used and in good condition. I also got it in record time. Love Amazon!!!
B000P1KTW8|3.0|Hi,  well, I allready had the DVD of this fantastic concert. It's brilliant: Bruce Springsteen and the Seeger Sessions Band; completely new interpretations of old songs. Great! This is a really must-have-disc.. BUT!!  This blu-ray is not worth. The video is unsharp, it seems that they just took the dvd and scaled it from 720 pixel to 1920 pixel. The sound is also ok, but it could be better for a blu-ray, sometimes you don't here some instruments you can cleary see.  That's sad, because I have some other concert blu-rays which are clearly sharp, with fantastic colours.    So, just take the DVD, that should work also and is much cheaper.
B001HN6972|5.0|Based on the excellent novel by Bernhard Schlink, \\"The Reader\\" tells a story of Michael (David Kross), a 15-year-old boy growing up in postwar Germany who engages in a secret affair with 30-something-year-old Hanna (Kate Winslet). The relationship only lasts over the course of a summer, but it is extremely intense and affects both Michael and Hanna deeply. Although the couple enjoy the time they spend in bed together, their connection is strongest when Michael reads aloud to Hanna. Abruptly, the affair comes to an end when Hanna suddenly leaves town without a word of explanation. Their paths cross again years later, when Michael's law school class sits in on a high-profile trial for German guard crimes against Jewish prisoners. Shockingly, Hanna appears as one of the defendants in the case, and it is revealed that she is a former member of the S.S. Years later, a grown Michael (Ralph Fiennes) still finds himself haunted by the memory of Hanna, and he reestablishes a connection with her.<br /><br />This is a fantastic film that features an extraordinary cast. Kross and Fiennes both deliver outstanding performances, but Winslet is truly remarkable in this film, and she alone is worth sitting through the movie for. This is an excellent, excellent film.
B001KMB6YG|4.0|I rented this movie apprehensively, as I read some of the reviews on here.  There wasnt much else to rent, and this movie did pique my interest and I had an odd desire to really want to watch it.  I made sure to watch the UNCUT version when viewing, and I have to say that I was very pleasently surprised!<br /><br />I know I will be bashed for this line too, but I have to admit that Vin's acting was actually fairly impressive - for the standard character that he always tends to play.  He is no different in this movie, however there are subtle nuances to this role that made it stand out (in my mind at least).<br /><br />The world on display in this movie was also fairly impressive - and I found that repeatedly throughout the movie that for a movie that is supposed to be this bad, it had a very impressive visual feel.  The settings all felt unique and had great detail.  My only complaint I guess would be the overly \\"ripped\\" off feel of the \\"megalopolis New York\\" to that of Blade Runner (over advertising, many extremely tall skyscrapers, etc).  That and not enough of the movie actually took place in what could have been an extremely cool setting (NY that is).<br /><br />There wasnt really all that much action, but there seemed to be enough to make the movie interesting while sticking to the main story (which I was actually glad for - beginning to get sick of action packed movies that have had their stories applied as an afterthought).<br /><br />However, I will say that it always felt as if this movie should have been much much more.  The epic scale and feel of the story, as well as the world, begged to be explored in much greater depth.  The characters could have been a little deeper - and the actual plot of the story could have made a little more sense (did feel a bit contrived).  Overall the movie did leave me wanting more - but I guess thats better than wanting to walk out of the theater!<br /><br />If I bought this movie sight unseen, I would have been pleased.  It was certainly worth the rental.  All I can say is watch the movie, have an open mind (and zero expectations) and you will walk away entertained to say the least.can say is watch the movie, have an open mind (and zero expectations) and you will walk away entertained to say the least.
B001KL3GWM|3.0|2006's Songlines was a potent stylistic brew that signaled big things for the DTB.  Sadly this new outing is already getting over-hyped.  The fact that it's accessible and getting mainstream radio air play is great but it feels like a small step backward.  The originals are slight and Doyle Bramhall and Susan Tedeschi's guest shots are mere throw offs. Along with Sonny Landreth, Trucks is the most innovative slide guitarist on the planet.  The covers of Dylan's \\"Down In The Flood\\" and Paul Pena's \\"Something To Make Me Happy\\" are excellent but a great player needs great songs to make a killer disc.  The hidden jewel of this band continues to be vocalist Mike Mattison. (Who is great in his \\"other\\" band Scapomatic) His voice may be an acquired taste, but be it Blues or Gospel he conveys great emotional depth.  I'm sorry but Delaney and Bonnie did blues, soul and r&b jam band material much better 30 years ago.
B001DPC52C|5.0|Amazing production of Within Temptation. I strongly recommend the CD & DVD, I've never seen something like this ... WT Rules!!!
B001FBIPF0|5.0|Fall Out Boy never disappoints!  This album is amazing with NO filler songs.  Absolutely love it love it love it!!!
B001DUJNGS|4.0|While I do agree that the cd does contain tracks that are not the greatest, I do have to disagree with some of my predecessors that have judged this album.  I have literally not given many of Enigma's albums a chance because I have felt that they missed the mark.  THIS IS NOT ONE OF THEM!!!  I love some of these songs.  The music, borderline techno, industrial, dance and new wave is great.  I just don't like Cretu's vocals!  Seven Lives and Touchness are great together, while We All Have the Same Parents scores points on my board.  I would definitely recommend this album to any new or old fan of Enigma!
B001I82RVS|3.0|I didn't hate this movie but I didn't love it either so it fits right in the middle of liking it.  I know there are plenty of fans of this kind of flick and I was surprised actually I didn't hate it.  There were a few funny parts and some way over the top gory parts which kind of reminded me of watching anime from when I was younger.  I didn't know much about this film going in but I gathered from the title what the movie might be about.  You can tell it is kind of lower budget but it really doesn't matter because you will probably forget as soon as you see the sheer amount of gore and weird scenes this movie serves up.  When I was watching the beginning and said to myself this looks kind of innocent than all of a sudden a guy head splits open and that was the end of thoughts like that.  That was my first thought that this movie would fit its title wonderfully.  The non stop gore fest came after that first gory scene but there were a few parts that I laughed at between the action which I think were commercials and it was all very strange but in a good way.  Overall this was still a good watch and I enjoyed it but I just didn't love it and I can pretty much bet this movie isn't for everyone and some people will be more critical.  I couldn't recommend this movie to everyone but fans of this genre or over the top gore fest will love it as well.
0316017922|4.0|This is  an fascinating book, and I recommend it, but there are some factual errors.  As a pilot, let me assure you there is no such thing as a \\"glide scope\\".  However, we do have something very similar to the description he gives called a \\"glide SLOPE\\".  That's SLOPE not SCOPE.  With such an obvious, and repeated error, how flawed is the rest of the book?

B000W9EOEC|5.0|Live albums are normally disappointing.  I can think of only a few live albums that sound great, and this is one of them.  Alive 2007 sounds better than the studio versions.  Once I heard it, I was disappointed that I purchased [[ASIN:B000EHPXYC Musique, Vol. 1: 1993-2005]] too.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of the album [[ASIN:B0007DAZW8 Human After All]].  This live album has some songs from that album so I was hesitant to purchase it.  However, the live versions are not the same songs as the studio versions.  Daft Punk mixes songs elements together with a lot more booming bass.  Listen to the song 4 sample and you'll hear the difference.<br /><br />The good songs from other albums such as Around The World come across nicely in this live album.  In most cases, I think they are superior to the album releases.  In the album versions, it is all very clean.  The songs need the club style booming bass or it sounds flat.<br /><br />The biggest downside to this album is how they treated One More Time.  It's a great song but too short.  If only the live version was as long as the studio version and had the slow build up in the middle of the song.  I can live without Musique Volume 1 except for One More Time.
0780020685|5.0|Get ready for the great Akira Kurosawa's masterful drama that inspired the likes of the Magnificent Seven, Star Wars and many more. Set in feudal Japan seven drastically different samurai are plunged together. Each having a distinct quality and character. One is young and naive but eager to learn while another is sage like with a general's cunning. There is the master of the blade and the blundering charismatic with a secret past. So many personalities and motives explored in this works. Whether it's loyalty or the battle between right and wrong. The seven will also have to endure strife and choose between fighting in overwhelming odds risking death or standing by while evil prevails. Despite the movie being in black and white it impacts harder emotionally than modern works. Plus this tale is full of wit, laughs, and raw tearing at our chests for the seven to be victorious. This is a foreign film so note you'll be reading subtitles.     Story/Script (classic): In this story these heroes come together to fight wrong and stand up for the weak. Peasants in a small village are constantly miss used by roaming bandits and to avenge this they attempt to hire Samurai to fend them off. One by one our seven noble heroes are faced with the tough decision to help the helpless for virtually free or stand idly by. Within this our hero's come together all for different reasons. The young Samurai is given a chance to learn and grow under the teachings of the older Samurai. A very loud and emotion driven samurai (Tofine Mourine) provides laughs and much heart to this story as well. Seven Samurai is simply overflowing with great lines. In any scene there is a plethora of thought provoking dialogue. These strong lines are only enhanced when combined with the great delivery by the actors.     Acting (Master-full): Takashi Shimura plays the aged samurai with skills of war fare and has a steady perfection to his performance. His role as the sapient member of the seven was more than believable. Toshiro Mifune explodes on the screen as an unlikely Samurai but one full of charisma and blunders. He'll make you laugh, cheer and feel deeply for his plight. Overall his performance is one of the best ever on screen EVER and it really jump started his now famous Japan career. The solemn group of villagers are played to perfection and also portrayed with much heart. All Samurai in this picture were played to the highest caliber leaving no weak acting in this entire epic.     Final thoughts: This is simply one of the greatest movies of the 20th century and one of my personal favorites. It's always on the critic's top 100 list and it's usually on the top ten list. All this being said obvious flaws are a lack of modern special effects, camera quality and sound. I personally didn't feel any of these really took away from this classic but it should be noted that this isn't a modern day shoot'em up. This drama is timeless due to this flawless story, script and acting. I recommend for anyone willing to read subtitles and sit through this 200 plus minuet piece of filming genius.
B001IQ5MNK|5.0|don't let the fact this book won a booker prize put you off - this is a gem, the best book ive read in ages.   it is HIGHLY readable, verry fresh, a great writing talent, and pitched perfectly.   a five star no holds barred look at india, and at ourselves, the race, within an engrossing story.  .... I have actively been reccomending people to read this one.    (well done aravind - can imagine you blew away some james rouse ag students!)
B0002ADY0Q|5.0|I love this album from beginning to end. You can really sit back and get lost in it. My favorite cut is \\"Time to Live\\". What a finely written song and you know what it is about. Byron sings clearly and with great diction on all cuts but I love \\"Time to live\\" best......great wah wah guitar as well. Every cut here is clean and you can hear all instruments clearly. What else can I say. I am also a Hensley fan, especially \\"Proud words on a dusty shelf\\"....\\"From time to time\\" being my favorite on that one.     Do yourself a favor and buy this. In fact, I recommend the first five studio albums from these guys. Really ahead of their time and taking their name from a character in a Dickens novel. Great band, then anyway.
0061122416|2.0|For morality tales with more wit and sophistication read The Decameron and One Thousand and One Nights (unabridged).  For much better fables that make you think and feel, read The Pearl by John Steinbeck and The Old Man and the Sea.  The best thing about this book was that it was short so it did not waste much of my time.  I cannot recommend this book for any serious reader.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini takes the reader deep into Communist and Taliban era rule in Afghanistan.  To be alive in the two decades of extremes was a challenge in itself, but to a woman, whose freedoms flourished under the Communist ideal of equality, and then withered away in the practices of the Taliban,-life might never change.  What is done behind closed doors happens no matter who is in charge, and this book reveals the tragic lives of women who find themselves at the mercy of the men in their lives.  Men who never really love them, but who trade them for honor's sake, to men who will use them as breeders for the sons they will teach to behave the same way.  Hope is something to be kept alive in the deep recesses of the heart, and one wrong move could earn you a death sentence both from your husband or the government he supports.  To a female reader, especially one in the States, I was saddened that the one thing a woman really wants and needs, love and respect from her family, is denied her repeatedly both by the men and the women in her life.  To read Mariam's story is to ponder the accident of birth location and the role which such an accident plays in shaping a life and mentality.  I felt for the murdered souls of young girls who never have any direct control over their lives, who live in sexual slavery to spouses they never chose.  It is heartbreaking, but hopeful, because without hope, there can be no change.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is a great soundtrack, I have enjoyed it over and over.  The music is great even if you haven't seen the movie.
B000002KHH|5.0|After there earth-shattering debut earlier that year in 1970,Sabbath follows basically the same sound,but produces an even larger number of classics than it's predecessor.    Probally the most influential Metal album of all time,this one set a standard that is still followed today in the Metal world.    There's a timelessness to this music,it;s sound the perfect melding of apocalyptic doom and youthful rebellion.  For many this is a soundtrack to teenage angst.    Sabbath will make better albums,in particular,there next four releases seemingly getting better and better,but there's something primal about this one taht makes many a seasoned Rocker and/or Metalhead return.    The Tracks are Legendary:    War Pigs-The ULTIMATE anti-war anthem,simple,yet powerful,may also be the greatest of all Sabbath songs as well as arguably being the classic Metal song.  The intro is a classic,with that slow build and the wail of an air raid siren predicting a forecast of Doom.  Iommi's solo is one of his simplest,yet best.    Paranoid-The Most beloved Metal anthem ever made.  This classic features one of the many greatest of Iommi's riffs and set a standard for speed in Metal.  Clearly inspired by earlier rock like Zeppelin's \\"Communication Breakdown\\",this is a masterpiece,which Ozzy still closes each show with.  Note:Sabbath's only number one hit(unbielevably) and was originally designed to just be filler(!) for the album.    Planet Caravan-Moody and etheral Sabbath tune that ranks among there most classic and underrated of songs.  There's a lovely quiet,bluesy feel to this song,with odd efefcts and bongos(?) that combine for a wonderfully,trippy experience.  Covered reverently by Pantera on the  otherwise ultra-heavy,\\"Far Beyond Driven\\" album in 1995.    Iron Man-The most recognizeable Metal song of all time.  For many this is the introduction to Heavy Metal,and this riff(arguably the most famous beside \\"Smoke on the Water\\") being one of the first that many a young axeman learns on his guitar.  Story of monster that returns for vengeance set a precedent for many to follow(Monsters are a favorite lyrical subject of the Metal God,Rob Halford in particular).    Electric Funeral-Doom Metal classic with another great,simple riff that will eventually morph into \\"Sweet Leaf\\"(Play the riff backwards),this is one of Sabbath's most wicked tunes,featuring a very ripped off mid-break(like the vocal distortion uses to shout,\\"Electric Funeral!)and still a live set favorite.    Hand of Doom-The most underrated track on the album,this is also the moodiest and creepiest.  Telling a Horror story revolving around Drug addiction,this is the first of many such songs on the subject,but remains arguably,the best.  The Bass intro to this is classic Geezer Butler.    Rat Salad-Instrumental track that showcases Bill Ward's extraordinary drum skills,but is otherwise a sort of filler track.  Still it's short and a pleasant headbang,and was the inspiration for the name of a band.  They later went from \\"Rat Salad\\" to the name \\"Van Halen\\".    Faires wear Boots-Silly,but infectious tune,dosen't really go anywhere,but is saved by the humorous lyrics and vocals of Ozzy,who seems to be singing an autobiographical tale of booze and drugs.  Another live set favorite and ranked among the band's classics.    And there you have it.  Metal's most famous and beloved album by the genre's greatest practicioners.    If you don't own this,do yourself a favor and get yourself a copy....or better yet.  Buy the Black Box set and get the first eight albums of this essential band.    You won't regret it.

B000ZN802W|3.0|I didn't know anything about the film when I got it...other than it was directed by Sean Penn.  So I watched it with a completely open mind.  I didn't even know that it was based on a true event, until the final closing credits.    I was quickly drawn into the story.  Emile Hirsch is a very attractive, sympathetic actor and I was rooting for the hero early on.  His encounters with folks he met along the road underlined my liking for him.  He was kind to everyone, gave the old guy in the phone booth a quarter, refused to take easy advantage of the cute teenage girl, and read all the right books.  His adventures before Alaska make up the best part of the film, in my opinion and I understand that these were based on letters from folks who had actually met McCandless.  Apparently he was a charismatic guy who made a big impression on people.      Once he gets to the wilderness and walks in, I had the feeling this wasn't going to end all that well for him.  But I hung in there, cheering him on, even as he kept taking in his belt.  Surely, such a sunny personality as his would find a way to triumph over adversity, one would think..    So, when the end came...not a pretty ending, nothing heroic, I was left feeling strangely empty.  Not sad, no tears, just...nothing.  The fake \\"spiritual\\" scene of the guy looking up at the light in the sky didn't do it for me....I found that sort of a cheap trick on the part of the film maker.    Reading the number of critical reviews here helped me realize why I was so strangely unaffected by what should have been an extremely moving film.  I am a multi-Kleenex movie watcher but I couldn't muster one tear for this guy.  I didn't really see him as inconsiderate and lacking in love, as a number of reviewers here did.  I really understood (I thought) how his background would drive him to such desperation.  It just seemed so pointless in the end.  Did anyone learn anything?  Well, maybe, as he wrote, between the lines in one of his books, that\\"happiness must be shared\\"...maybe that was it.  Too bad the lesson came too late.  Maybe, as the voice over of his sister claimed, that his absence had a positive effect on his warring, materialistic parents.       The cast is very good, especially Katherine Keener and Hal Holbrook.  But I don't think Hirsch was the right actor for the role.  McCandless must have had a strong self-destructive nature and this doesn't come across at all in his character or performance.  Sean Penn, had he been younger, would have been great at showing both the darkness that must have been there and the charm that people spoke of.  Hirsch just looks like a really sweet kid who might live next door and whom you'd want to hire to mow your lawn.      Mostly I think that the blame for the misfire of the film lies with Penn as the writer and director.  He may have attempted to portray McCandless in a neutral way but McCandless comes across as everyone's hero...the good looking, really kind, likable kid who is trying to live a pure moral existence.  It's sort of dangerous and even irresponsible, I think, to give his view of McCandless.  If Penn had aimed at a more accurate documentary style portrayal, we would have seen the character's fatal flaws earlier one.  If Penn had wanted to give us pure fiction, then a more satisfying dramatic ending would have been in order.  If the boy's death really did humanize his parents, maybe showing that would have given us some sense of resolution.  As another reviewer wrote, the way the kid dwindled away, even the bear didn't bother with him.  That's really sad, given all of the passion with which he embarked on his pilgrimage.  Reminds me of the line from  T.S. Eliot poem  about the world ending not with a bang, but with a whimper.  I would have wanted more for the real Chris McCandless.

B000MX7V5M|4.0|The tourists along the French Riviera are being robbed of their valuable jewelry.  And the robberies have all the trademarks of notorious jewel thief John Robie (Cary Grant).  There's just one problem, John retired years ago after serving time in prison and the French underground.  But the police won't take his word for it and are insisting he's returned to his old ways.<br /><br />So John decides that the only way to clear his name is to find the real burglar.  Working closely with insurance man Hughson (John Williams) he attempts to pick the next victim so he can catch the burglar.  And he settles on Jessie Stevens (Jessie Royce Landis) and her daughter Frances (Grace Kelly).  But Frances turns out to be more of a distraction then the bachelor John counted on.  Will he succumb to temptation?  And will he catch the thief?<br /><br />Those looking for a typical Hitchcock thriller will be highly disappointed.  Yes, there's a bit of a mystery here, but it is pretty light.  Instead, the middle segment is devoted to the budding relationship between John and Frances.  And it is a complete hoot.  I was laughing so hard at some of the lines.  And they got away with some pretty suggestion comments, too.  Frankly, I was disappointed when the movie went back to focusing on the mystery, although it was a satisfying ending.<br /><br />And I have to mention the scenery.  It was filmed on location.  I'm ready to hop the next plane to see the French Riviera myself.<br /><br />This may be lighter then Hitchcock's normal fair, but it is plenty fun.  Sit back and get ready to enjoy a good film.
075640407X|5.0|This is an excellent book for those of us who like to read the classic fantasy formula done well. This is a heroic tale that's full of magic and mystery. The main character is likable and intelligent. This is no ordinary boy who just \\"lucks\\" his way out of things ala harry potter or tad williams' books. Instead, he is incredibly bright and talented, which helps him to stand out and become a heroic character with the power and knowledge to affect the world.    Give this one a try if you want to read a fantasy book that offers you a fast-paced adventure following a boy who goes through some incredible things on a quest for justice.
0810970686|5.0|First introduced to the Wimpy Kid series a year ago, these books get my high praise for their use of a first-person, kid's voice. Simplistic drawings add a nice touch to the diary format, and they are both easy and enjoyable to read for kids 8+.<br /><br />Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw is as good, if not better than the other books in the series. Laugh-out-loud funny for both kids and parents, it's one that gets the \\"Mama, listen to this...\\" over and over again, followed by an infectious giggle.<br /><br />This author writes how 12 year old kids talk and/or think, which takes those of us who were 12 a very long time ago, right back to middle school. In all honesty, Diary books can be read an enjoyed by a broad cross-section of age groups.<br /><br />The bottom line: Don't hesitate to buy this one.
0765350386|5.0|There are some books that keep you reading to the detriment of your own health, up until 2am when you know you have to get up early the next day. This is one of them. This is a classic fantasy tale in the sense that there is a main character, she has a hidden power, and through the discovery and use of that power, is able to rise up and become a heroic character. Everything in between however, is unusual and full of interesting mysteries.  For instance, the magic system is incredibly detailed and rooted in the reality of the world. You understand the capabilities of magic users fairly clearly, and yet there is room at the edges for the unknown.    The pacing in this book is excellent. You won't find yourself skipping over passages \\"to get to the good stuff.\\" It was probably the quickest 650 pages I've ever read, and the last 150 or so force you to keep reading nonstop. There is a satisfying conclusion to this book and had it been the last one, you would feel fairly satisfied. However, I'm glad there are two more, as there are many interesting questions that remain to be answered, and a hint at something even bigger and more threatening in the near future. I'm going to pick the other two up as soon as I recover from the marathon reading session of the last few days.
B001FB4VXU|3.0|Series One was superb. This one is concentrating far too much on Leonard's love life. The whole thing is becoming less of an ensemble piece and more of a duet between Sheldon and Leonard. It is also moving towards high school angst instead of making more of the general nerdishness (and Howard's mother!)

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I don't think this is \\"the best comic book movie of all time\\".  So why did I rate it 5 stars?  Because it may be the beginning of something wonderful.  I just wish they split up these story lines, made this film more joker-centric, and then they could move on to someone else.

B000Y9PILI|2.0|I have two main problems with this re-mix:    1. The CD is VERY compressed and clips with practically every drum kick. It's just as loud as a modern metal CD! why do this? HIGHER VOLUME DOESN'T EQUAL HIGHER FIDELITY!      2. It sounds like a completely different album. With all the wizardry of modern studio equipment they pretty much made this sound like it was recorded yesterday. Why? This is not the \\"songs for beginners\\" you grew up on. The new mix reveals many things you never heard before but obscures many of the subtleties of the original.     In the end, I can't give it one star because I love this album so much; but this isn't really it... I'd take a scratched-up dollar bin vinyl copy over this release any day of the week.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|I bought this CD based on the Adele's performance on SNL, which was very good. I didn't find this cd to be nearly as good, and I am a bit disappointed. I guess I would describe her voice on the CD as too pitchy. Her SNL performance was good, and hopefully her future CDs reflect the quality of her voice.
0312360266|3.0|Title: Marked  Author: PC Cast and Kristin Cast  Publisher: St. Martin's Press  Reading Level: Young Adult  Publication Date: May 2007  Pages: 320    Rating: C+  Plot - 17/20  Characters - 15/20  Writing - 15/20  Originality - 18/20  Entertainment - 7/10  Recommendation - 7/10  Total: 79/100    Summary:  Enter the dark, magical world of The House of Night, a world very much like our own, except here vampyres have always existed. Sixteen-year-old Zoey Redbird has just been Marked as a fledgling vampyre and joins the House of Night, a school where she will train to become an adult vampire. That is, if she makes it through the Change--and not all of those who are Marked do. It sucks to begin a new life, especially away from her friends, and on top of that, Zoey is no average fledgling. She has been chosen as special by the vampyre Goddess Nyx. Zoey discovers she has amazing powers, but along with her powers come bloodlust and an unfortunate ability to Imprint her human ex-boyfriend. To add to her stress, she is not the only fledgling at the House of Night with special powers: When she discovers that the leader of the Dark Daughters, the school's most elite group, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts, Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace her destiny--with a little help from her new vampyre friends.    Review:  When I first started this book, it got me hooked. The writing was neat and the characters cool. But soon enough, it got . . . strange. Some of it felt unreal, and some of it was just plain weird. Like Zoey and her deal with the words 'pooh' and 'poopy'. And Erin and Shaunee with that 'Twin' thing. It's just not real, you know.    But other then that. The plot was very interesting. Zoey and her transition through The Change was peculiar, but it kept me reading (after I stopped to read Marley and Me.) Zoey and her friends were kind of two-dimensional. The Casts were average writers, good, but not anything spectacular.    The whole plot was very original and alluring. The beginning was exciting, the middle was slow and the end was entrancing. Riveting enough that I want to read the next novel in the House of Night series, Betrayed, but maybe not right away.
B001HPP2XW|5.0|I just received the new Paramount Centennial Collection \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" and I have to say it's wonderful.  They did a great job of remastering and Dolby editing.

B001CTA1S4|4.0|\\"Doubt,\\" written and directed by John Patrick Shanley, stars Meryl Streep as Sister Aloysius Beauvier.  The year is 1964, and Sister Aloysius runs her Bronx school, St. Nicholas, with an iron fist.  The children cower before her icy glare, and when she smiles, which is rare, her face fails to light up very much.  She hates newfangled inventions such as ball point pens and is constantly criticizing the girls and boys for minor offenses.  When Sister James, a young, pretty, and naive teacher, suggests that Father Brendan Flynn may be paying too much attention to the school's only black student, Donald Miller, Beauvier launches a crusade to oust Flynn.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman is excellent as Father Flynn, a charismatic priest who coaches the basketball team, instructs the altar boys, and delivers brief but meaningful sermons from the pulpit.  He stands for everything that Sister Aloysius disdains:  embracing change, showing kindness and empathy, and reaching out to others with love.  However, he did leave his previous two parishes under mysterious circumstances, and although she has no hard evidence, Sister Aloysius feels certain that Father Flynn has done something wrong.  She urges him to bare his soul and confess his misdeeds.  He furiously denies any wrongdoing and chastises her for being rigid and coldblooded.<br /><br />The script, which Shanley adapted from his stage play, is a bit too heavy-handed.  A metaphor about gossip being like runaway feathers from a pillow is accompanied by a shot of a woman watching the feathers she has released flying all over the street.  In addition, Meryl Streep plays the forbidding Sister Aloysius with a stiffness that is almost robot-like.  When she finally unleashes her wrath at Hoffman, her lack of control seems extreme and out of character.  Amy Adams is fine as a sweet nun who is in a quandary.  Should she follow her own instincts or model herself after the confident Sister Aloysius?  Hoffman's Father Flynn has such a good heart that, since there is no proof to the contrary, you want to believe in his innocence.  Viola Davis, as Donald Miller's mother, is outstanding in a short but pivotal scene.  As she walks along with Sister Aloysius, the nun voices her suspicions about Father Flynn and is shocked when Mrs. Miller reacts in a way that the nun had not anticipated.<br /><br />Shanley tackles a number of important themes:  how the civil rights movement affected all-white schools, the ways in which the \\"old boy\\" network of priests may have shielded miscreants, and the corrosive nature of mistrust.  Was Father Flynn actually guilty of anything?  We can never know the full truth about his behavior, a fact that even the arrogant Sister Aloysius must acknowledge in a rare moment of humanity.at, since there is no proof to the contrary, you want to believe in his innocence.

B001GKJ2FM|4.0|But it's a lot of fun to watch!  And come on people, who doesn't love a little ABBA once in a while?  I'd bet that most of us have an old ABBA song that we remember well enough to sing along with in the privacy of the car, maybe even an old ABBA album stashed away somewhere, even if we'd never admit it to the guy that sits next to us at the office.  Mamma Mia suits the mood, soothes that 30 year old memory of listening to ABBA songs.  This movie is really cheesy in some parts, but that's easily overlooked while you're tapping your toe and singing along under your breath!  Forget the cheesy, don't be too critical of Pierce Brosnan's singing, kick-up your feet, relax and enjoy the show, cuz it really is a light-hearted, entertaining movie.  And in this world today, light-hearted entertainment may be just what you need!

031606792X|5.0|Like many others posting reviews, I read the 1st 3 books in record time and could not put them down, sometimes even forgetting to eat(face turns red).   Once I got to the 3rd book, I tried to read slower so that I could extend my happiness with the Cullens and Bella. When I got to the 4th book, I could already feel the void that the ending of the saga would leave in my passion for reading.   I've read BD 3 times. I loved it from the 1st. I went back and read the 1st 3 books a 2nd time before reading BD a 2nd time, and then read it a 3rd time out of fear for looking for a new book to fill the void. I just recently started feeling like reading other books (Thank God). Anyway before I said good-bye to Twilight for now (I'm sure I will read again in the future, as I do with many other books, I wanted to post a review of BD to summarize why it is such a good book. My reasons for loving it are mostly for the good heartedness of the book.  1. Bella and Edward's love grows and matures to a point where marriage makes sense.   2. Bella and Edward continue on in many 1st experiences. As their 1st kiss was exciting in Twilight, many of the things they experience in BD are firsts. And while the tension is not there because we now know they will be together, it is still fun to go through these experiences with them because you have come to love them so much.  3. Family is a main theme in the book, and anyone family oriented will understand many of the things that happen within the Cullen family.  4. Jacob gets to be happy FINALLY! I don't care how it happens, just glad to see him free of the torture of not being able to have someone he wants.   5. The bond between the wolves and the vampires become stronger only proving that enemies can become friends with the right motivation.   6. Jacob and Edward like each other, and consider one another family.  7. Edward gets to \\"see\\" into Bella's mind. Perfect ending - this has been something frustrating for him since first sight, and because he never thinks himself worthy of Bella, when he finally sees their relationship through Bella's \\"eyes\\", he knows for sure that he means as much to her as she does to him. And because she has control over when he can hear her thoughts, she still can still keep her thoughts private like anyone should be able to when in a relationship.

0684865130|4.0|Writing a review for Catch-22 by Joseph Heller is sort of Catch-22. If I don't tell you enough about it, you probably won't be interested in the book. But if I tell you too much, you won't have to read it because you'll already know what it's about.<br /><br />But I suppose I should try.<br /><br />In general, I liked the book. It was a little difficult to get into at first, mostly because the book focuses on war stories, and I'm not really that into war-type fiction. At the same time, though, the dialogue is exceptionally witty and kept me entertained throughout the novel.<br /><br />Some people have compared \\"The Developers\\" to \\"Catch-22,\\" which I take as the utmost compliment. I see some similarities in the two, although I bow to Heller in producing a classic.<br /><br />So, in telling you about \\"Catch-22,\\" I'm not spending more time marketing \\"The Developers,\\" so other people might not ever see if there is anything alike about the two books. I suppose it's a Catch-22, but I'm willing to live with it.

B001L5VYFI|5.0|Not sure what the previous reviewer means about the \\"new\\", this is simply the MP3 version of the live third album by Crosby, Stills & Nash (which was their second as Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and the first live album). It was originally released in 1971, and it peaked at #1 on the Billboard Top Pop Albums chart. The live recordings were from shows at The Fillmore East, New York, June 2-June 7, 1970 The Chicago Auditorium, Chicago, July 5, 1970 and The Forum, Los Angeles, June 26-June 28, 1970. A must for any CSN/CSN&Y fan - but it was not their best effort. A few songs come across very well - and others were just not on the mark. For me, Southern Man was the standout, with a real jam session feel to it.
B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Been seeing previews for Gran Torino and it looked like a cross between Million Dollar Baby and Dirty Harry. The early trailers weren't doing much for me, but then the secondary trailers had some nice plot development and intrigue. I was more interested in catching MILK or The Reader today, but something drew me to this movie. And you know what that was? It was the BEST MOVIE OF 2008.<br /><br />Yes, I declared this now. The nominees aren't out yet even, and I am usually more reserved in my reviews. I just can't be that reserved here. I literally walked out of the film and wanted to sit in the car and sob. Sob like a little baby.<br /><br />We know Eastwood is good. He's always been good, although his gravely voice was off putting (much like Bale's in another much hyped film). In this film Eastwood plays Walt Kowalski, a Korean war veteran, who's stuck in back a 1/2 century. His wife recently died, his self-absorbed sons and grand children just suck, and the catholic priest is played by a boy (Christopher Carley) who looks like he just got his driver's license, although through his tenacity the audience can't help but want to pinch his cheeks by the second hour in. Eastwood's gravely snarl is punctuated by the Hmong people who've overtaken most of his Detroit suburb. Ever Asian racial slur you could imagine is used by Eastwood in this film and the man sitting next to me scoffing at everyone one were both quite bothersome. It felt overdone to a fault (no I do not hear people actually talk like this anywhere.)<br /><br />Eastwood saves the life of Thao (Bee Vang) from a local gang and begins to teach the boy to be a man. Thao bugs the hell out of me, not because he's a \\"wimp\\" so much than his mannerisms, haircut (which he could've easily changed in a hilarious barber shop scene!), and fact that his true transformation never really comes to fruition except at the very end of the film (and that's even a week show of it).<br /><br />I understand this is an Eastwood vehicle all around (included his real life sons), but , for me, Thao's sister, Sue, stole the show! Introduced as the youngest in a house of women and the older, bossy (well meaning) sister of Thao, Sue is the vehicle who brings the racist and reluctant Walt into the Hmong culture, her home and her people. Ahney Her playing Sue has never acted before, but I was surprised at how refreshingly she holds her own through her seamless banter with one of the most talented actors of his generation. Typically, I am writing these reviews after nominations have been released, and I have no idea if Her will even receive a nod, but here I assert she deserves the nod. Now, for some, being nominated (especially in a first role), is the reward itself, and we both know that Her'll be up against some talented and experienced actresses. If nominated, I fear she will not win.<br /><br />Spoilers below....Now earlier I mentioned that I sobbed in the end. True. Totally true. This hardass who beats a Hmong gang member, shoves his fists through glass windows, and pokes guns at asians and blacks alike, would be expected to seek out retribution in the same manner as he lived his life through the film. This wasn't true. This isn't how it ended. He made a decision for his new family and friends, made good with his dead wife and her priest, and found peace in salvation through his sacrifice of himself for Thao & Sue.<br /><br />The `72 Gran Torino that Eastwood never drives in the film weaves itself through the narrative as a harken back to a time when Walt worked for Ford (and put the drive shaft in on the line himself), an american car company, when his wife was alive and his sons weren't as self-absorbed as they've become. Back to a time before when American was \\"American\\". As Walt progressed, developed, and opened himself to Thao, Sue, and his neighbors, the Gran Torino became a symbols of manhood of Thao (who was given permission to take it for his first date) ad a rite of passage for him, as he is given this car, by Walt, in his will at the resolution of the film.<br /><br />Sue's simple survival of the rape and beating, Thao's slow progression to manhood and succession, the priest's realization of what living and dying really means, brings together a neighborhood, a people, and everything that Walt once felt stratified his neighborhood and his contemporary and disgusting life. A life that he finally lived for those around him, who he came to love.resolution of the film.

B001GXY92U|5.0|I know that there are stuffy purists out there who would not approve of David Fray's interpretations of these Bach concertos, but don't let that put you off as after all, Bach never originally wrote these as PIANO concertos anyway - they are transcriptions of works for other instruments. This album is an absolute joy; Fray infuses these pieces with new life, exquisite beauty and new insights.   For me what stands out is the attention to detail - every note, every tone seems to be carefully considered, with nothing out of place. The quality of the recording is superb, piano and orchestra nicely balanced. It's such a pleasure to rediscover these works. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this recording.

If you want an 80's style version of a Lovecraft movie you'd be far better off with The Unnamable, or you you want a Lovecraft movie truly in keeping with H.P. Lovecraft's work, then go with the recent The Call of Cthulhu.  But the bottom line is, it doesn't matter to me whether this movie had anything to do with H.P Lovecraft's story, it was just bad moviemaking.  Evil Dead II this ain't.

B0006IIPIK|4.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is one movie that embodies 'fun' in a manner I have never before seeen in a movie. Set in 1939, this film is an excellent snapshot of the era's sci-fi, taken with a camera from the 21st Century. With giant, riveted robots and automated planes wreaking havoc on New York City(mysteriously stealing the city's generators)and around the world, Sky Captain (Jude Law) is called to the rescue. Ta-da! With his highly modified P-40 fighter-plane, Sky Captain brings down several of the metallic brutes, when they suddenly take to the skies and leave. He and Polly Perkins (a reporter for 'The Chronicle') take off in search of answers, leading them on a quest across the world, and into realms beyond belief.       This movie does not pretend to be realistic. It does not intend to be emotionally charged. Nobody was gunning for the Oscars. But what it meant to do was be a fun, eye-catching, exciting adventure for the whole family----something it does with both barrels (and ray-guns) blazing. It is unique, captivating, and well-made. With all the graphic violence and immoral behavior splayed across the silver screen so much, it is nice to see a change.    Ryan Robledo  Author of the [[ASIN:1425160735 Aelnathan:]]

B001M5UDGS|5.0|First, I wanted to mention that I read some of the reviews and some people ended up with DVD-R copies. That is a bit weird, as I checked and mine is a DVD. I am not sure how that ended up happening but I do not think that is Joss Whedon's fault. I doubt he is even aware of it happening. But now to the important part..      It was completely amazing and funny. I loved every minute of it, have had songs and lines from the show stuck in my head all the time since first watching it. I have made other people watch and thus got them hooked on it. I have been a fan of Joss Whedon's from the time Buffy aired. I found Firefly a little late on the game but love that series as well,even more then Buffy.         The humor in this show is much like the other shows that Joss produces and it's quite entertaining to watch. I will obviously be supporting him as much as possible. Then again I even buy the roleplaying books related to the shows he puts out because I am that kind of nerd.        I don't think you can lose when Joss and Nathan Fillon are in a room together, and Joss always has a way of picking a group of people that simply fit so well together. I would recommend this to anyone and if you haven't seen Joss's other stuff then I would recommend that too. I am looking forward to the new stuff he puts out.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|I bought this CD because Amazon recommended.  I figured if I don't like it I could always resell it.  However, after listening to this CD I found it refreshing.  Taylor Swift is a great young artists and has given me up for the future of music.      Fearless is a universally friendly CD in that regardless if your preference in music is country or pop you will enjoy this CD.  The CD particularlly plays well because the songs  do not alienate one type fan genre or the other. It gives a good balance of both country and pop.    A lot of orchestration on this cd, whether in the forefront or background,  which I really enjoy because orchestras don't get much credit for being an important part of popular music.    My favorite tracks on Fearless are Fearless, You Belong With Me, Breathe, and of course the current radio hit Love Story. Tayl    Swift is a reat voice for a younger generation whom sings about topics relevant to what a teenager would currently dealing with and thinking of. Which is why this Taylor Swift is such a refreshing artist in this day and age of music.  If you love music this is the CD to pick up, regardless of what particular music you prefer.

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|I hesitated ranking Katy's CD among my favorites at first. But this CD is worth listening to 500%. A very special voice, not only in the hit songs 'I kissed a girl' and 'Hot 'n cold' but also in 'Ur so gay ' or 'one of the boys' presents itself. This singer is right up there with KT Tunstall and Avril Lavigne. The rocksongs may sound a little tacky popular but are a joy to listen to. A fresh sound between all the temporary new music. The lyrics might not have Bob Dylan content, but does every CD has to have a message other than it being a message that life can be fun or questioning yourself if it is really so bad if a girl kisses another girl just because its actually very pleasant. Quiet moments in this CD like in 'I'm still breathing' seem to bring harmony among the songs. This CD sounds like a christal bell.<br />It made my day a happy one! Buy it, you won't regret!
B0012OQZWA|5.0|Origin has done it again.  They have topped their last album making this their best album of their career.  There's actually some catchy elements to the maddness this time around with a little groove added to the blazing blastbeats and sweeping guitars.  I have actually found myself getting some of the riffs stuck in my head.  This album completely jams.  If you like origin you will like this album as well.

B001LRJH0U|1.0|Ridiculous characters. Leading lady my least favorite actress, the Cheesiest and contrived one liners ever (trying to create a Tombstone aura). Names are sterotypical...I could go on and on.    This movie has the fake gloss that Tombstone did but does not have the substance of that movie. I lacks the heartfelt grit that makes truly great westerns..Open Range, 3:10 to Yuma and Unforgiven.    My wife and I were almost embarassed at some points of the movie. I would avoid this one.
B001GKJ2ES|5.0|Not wanting to wait until this movie became available in The Netherlands I decided to take one of my first peeks on Amazon and immediately landed the jackpot with this beautiful Limited Edition Collector's Gift set.   When taking the booklet box from the outer case the glare looked like just a fancy decoration, but upon closer inspection it actually turned out to be the kill order for Wesley Gibson which is an extremely neat detail, the rest of the contents are of good quality as well.  If you ask me if I would reccommend this product to friends and acquaintances who are into special edition movie stuff the answer would definately be yes!
B001NFNFNU|4.0|If ever you needed a film to showcase a woman's inner strength, this has to be up there along with Flightplan and Million Dollar Baby, another of Clint Eastwood's wonderfully crafted masterpieces.<br /><br />A truly polished performance by one of Hollywood's Darlings, Angelina has come of age since her days in Girl, Interrupted. Playing Christine Collins, a single working mom in the 1920s, she epitomizes the burdensome reality of juggling work with the duties of looking after a 9-year old son, Walter.<br /><br />The movie doesn't really strike you until the moment the young boy spills the beans on the goings-on in the ranch to Detective Lester-Ybarra. Before this, those watching will probably be thinking that this is just another run-of-the-mill \\"Woman standing up to corrupt police\\" movie.<br /><br />It's just shocking that the powers-that-be in LAPD would allow such practises like the dastardly Code 12 to go unaudited. It is a \\"law\\" that allowed police officers to really just play god and condemn anyone they didn't see fit to live in society. It's just degrading the conditions the women suffered in the asylum, most notably the electric treatment administered to keep them in line.<br /><br />I must add though, that I thought Jason Butler Harner gave a pretty convincing portrayal of the psychopath in the same vein as Norman Bates.<br /><br />In the end, it's only just as well that justice prevailed to uncover what must truly be one of the most shocking truths in the history of LAPD. However if one were to ponder, not much has changed in the quality of the Police Systems in California in recent years I fear, most recently the New Years Day shooting of an unarmed suspect by an officer in Bay Area shows that there are still cops out there who take matters into their own hands.<br /><br />In conclusion, a truly great movie to watch and if one were to be asked what they could draw from watching Changeling....it would be the relentless pursuit of justice and most importantly, COURAGE! Courage to stand up for what you believe in, love and hold dear.you believe in, love and hold dear.

0743298039|1.0|So glad I didn't purchase this book; checked it out from the library instead.  It starts off fine, but quickly turns very bad.  Very strange and not believable.  It's more dysfunctional than mystery - incest, evil. None of the characters are normal or likeable, just weird.  I cannot recommend this book, but if you still feel like you would like to read it, I recommend your local library.

When you re-read the series over the years, as you surely will, you will probably skip this first book.<br /><br />I absolutely love this series and hope the first book doesn't deter people from falling in love with the rest of the series and these wonderful, wonderful characters.
B001NFNFNU|4.0|This is another excellent film from Clint Eastwood. Even though it's not on the same level as his last four films (a remarkable run by anyone's standards), it's still very good and is worth seeing.<br /><br />The most remarkable thing about this film is the amazing performances from everyone involved.  Angelina Jolie proves, to me at least, that she is a fantastic actress.  She really becomes Christine Collins in this film. You stop thinking Angelina Jolie, tabloid star.  She's actually quite extraordinary, moving from subtlety to anger and hysteria without ever coming across as self conscious or over the top.  The performances by the children in this film are extremely well acted.  The interrogation scene where a child named Sanford Clarke (played by Eddie Alderson) confesses his complicity in a rash of serial killings is quite extraordinary to watch.  Alderson gives an extraordinarily performance filled with depth.  The police officers, played by Jeffrey Donovan and Michael Kelly, give excellent performances.  Kelly's is especially effective, playing the only really decent cop on the force.  John Malkovich is fine as usual.  Jason Butler Harner, who plays the serial killer who has something to do with the missing boy, is quite extraordinary and very creepy.  He's not over the top like many portrayals of serial killers are these days, and Clint doesn't romanticise him at all.  The scenes where we see the serial killer's work are shot superbly, showing enough blood to make the scenes sufficiently creepy, but never over indulging in it, like a lot of films these days do.  The film where the killer is hung is very well done as well.  Clint shows enough for you to realise how brutal hanging is.<br /><br />The main complaint here is that the script is rather predictable and doesn't have much memorable dialogue.  The story itself is fascinating (and sadly true), but I found much of the writing rather one-dimensional and obvious, especially many of the supporting characters, who seem more like plot devices than real people (the doctor who runs the asylum that Collins is committed to and Jeffrey Donovan's cop are good examples). It hurts the film a bit in my opinion. Aside from that, the production design is astoundingly good.  The film takes place in the 1920's, and you really feel that you're back there.  The phone operator venue where Christine Collins works is a wonder to behold.  It's wonderful production design. The cinematography is excellent as usual, and the music (by Eastwood himself) is especially effective, especially the sad theme that closes the film.<br /><br />The film is quite bleak and disturbing, showing the very dark side of man existed in 1920's Los Angeles as it does today.  Honestly, it's tough to watch at times.  Never does Eastwood sentimentalise anything, nor does he gloss over anything either.  This is quite a shocking true story.  If you dig Eastwood, you owe it to yourself to check this film out.  This was one of two films that Clint put out in 2008.  Most directors can barely manage one film a year, and Clint has made two excellent films in 2008 (Gran Torino is the other one, which is fantastic and better than this one).  The fact that he hardly got any nominations for both films is a travesty.  Methinks the Academy is jealous of Clint's output.ore like plot devices than real people (the doctor who runs the asylum that Collins is committed to and Jeffrey Donovan's cop are good examples).

Greg Heffley is back, and he's even more hilariously self-centered and mired in dilemmas of his own creation.<br /><br />I loved the first book in this series (\\"the cheese touch\\"!!!) and was a little disappointed by the second.  \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid--The Last Straw\\" is an absolutely hilarious book which is at least as funny as the original.  What happens when Mom stops washing Greg's clothes?  Will he survive the school dance?  Can he find love?  Has he figured out the secret to popularity?  Will be succeed in organized sports?

1400031354|5.0|This wonderful book takes the promise of the first in this series and turns it into a fully realized novel.  The reader arrives at the end of the book with a sense of satisfaction and simple happiness.<br /><br />The characters in this book feel absolutely real-- so real, in fact, that I almost have to struggle to accept that if I traveled to Botswana I would not be able to find them.  Gentle humor, kindness, unique culture, truly good and decent values, yet human mistakes... this book has everything required for a wonderful read.  The reader will finish this book wanting to immediately begin the next in the series.<br /><br />Wonderful dialogue, fascinating settings, real human dilemmas, and above all the most endearing characters ---- you will adore this book and feel lifted up by it.

1400031362|5.0|Another WONDERFUL installment in the series.  Mma Makutsi is the real hero of this volume.  When Mr. JLB Matekoni succumbs to serious depression, she takes over management of Speedy Motors in addition to her duties for the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency.<br /><br />The orphans are struggling a bit to adjust to their new lives with Mma Ramotswe.  Finances are extremely tight, and Mma Makutsi saves the day by taking on a wealthy client who needs assistance investigating the backgrounds of 4 finalists for the Miss Beauty and Integrity pageant (a huge event).  Both this case and Mma Ramotswe's investigation of a Botswana family revolve around the theme of \\"the old Botswana morality\\".<br /><br />This book, like others in the series, makes the reader want to hop on a plane to dry, economically challenged Botswana.  Love of the land, love of the cattle, and love of family... the life lived by Mma Ramotswe, Mma Makutsi, and Mr. JLB Matekoni is a good one.  Time spent reading these books lifts the heart, renews the soul, and brings a sense of happiness and even joy.<br /><br />You will love this book.

B001DU8T6S|5.0|Being a long-time Queen fan, as well as a Bad Company fan, I was eager to see what happened when when Paul Rodgers teamed up with Queen.  Well, the results are amazing!  I was blown away with how great these guys sound!      Yes, it is a bit different than the old Queen, but that's because it's NOT the old Queen.  You can't compare Freddie and Paul; their styles are too drastically different.  That doesn't mean that one is worse than the other, just different.  If you look at it as a new band, without comparing to previous works, you'll love this album.  Actually, you might love it even if you do compare them, but this is to the naysayers that are convinced that the band can't exist without Freddie.  How many other bands have gone on to success without a founding member?  Why not these guys?    Now let me hit on some favorite tracks:    The title track is truly rocking! A great opener for a strong album.    I love that they included the powerful 'Say It's Not True' on this album.  If you want to hear the original live version, check out [...] and get the album from the first of the benefit concerts. Trust me, it's worth it!    I think 'C-lebrity', which pokes fun at the current trend of young people willing to do anything (or nothing) to earn their 5 minutes of fame, is a very catchy tune with a great beat.    'Some Things That Glitter' is probably my favorite song right now.  It's a truly beautiful song with a very sweet message.
B001KVZ6BG|5.0|This movie is great. I don't mean just good but great. There are many people that are offended by the \\"slums\\" in India but guess what? It's the truth. Open your eyes and realize there are areas in the world (US included) that have slums. People in the slums resort to stealing, killing, prostitution, anything just to survive.    This movie captures the essence of poverty, pain and suffering associated with the slums. The story and ending is very touching. I can't recommend it enough.

B000001DWG|5.0|In an alternative universe Mother Love Bone is a household name, praised by critics and recognized as one of the best bands of the 90s, and no one has ever heard the words \\"Pearl Jam\\" mentioned in that order. In this universe singer Andrew Wood was one of the biggest rock stars of the 1990s and he continues to enjoy his celebrity today....<br /><br />Listening to the 1992 self-titled Mother Love Bone compilation, (also known as \\"Star Dog Champion) which consists of the band's brilliant debut album \\"Apple\\" (1990) and an earlier EP \\"Shine\\" (1989) it's easy to ask \\"what could have been?\\" If Andrew Wood hadn't died of a drug overdose, what would his status and the status of Mother Love Bone be today? What great music would they have gone on to record?<br /><br />But alas, Mother Love Bone died along with Andrew Wood and one is left to speculate. What we are left with is just one album and an EP, the sole testaments of a great band.<br /><br />While there are a fair amount of albums that weren't recognized in their day (like Love's \\"Forever Changes\\" or The Velvet Underground and Nico, both 1967) no album has been as criminally neglected as \\"Apple.\\" While the album received and still receives good-to-glowing reviews and \\"Crown of Thorns\\" is considered a classic, the band and their music, have been, overall, greatly overlooked and under appreciated.<br /><br />What exactly was the sound of this great band? Grunge, right? After all, Mother Love Bone was from Seattle and three of the band members (Ament, Gossard and Bruce Fairweather) were in the Green River (one of the pioneers of Seattle grunge) so \\"Apple\\" should have a total grungy sound, right? Well, not exactly.<br /><br />Listening to Mother Love Bone and then comparing it with Mudhoney, it's clear that when Green River split, singer Mark Arm took the band's sound with him. Mudhoney was really just a continuation of Green River, with its distorted guitars and \\"fuzz\\" while Mother Love Bone had an entirely new sound.<br /><br />Imagine crossing Led Zeppelin with Aerosmith and Jefferson Airplane, and that's pretty much what you get with Mother Love Bone--a totally retro, neo-psychedelic, hard rocking band with groove-laden bluesy riffs, killer solos with strong melodies. Andrew Wood, who could have been a love child of Janis Joplin and David Lee Roth, was a charismatic, gifted singer whose voice and words combined a paradoxical mixture of utopian happiness and lonely despair, sometimes in the same breath. This makes listening to \\"Apple\\" kind of a unique experience. In some ways it's a celebratory, happy album, and in others, it's a deeply sad one.<br /><br />While only two members of MLB went on to play in Pearl Jam, if you listen to \\"Apple\\" and then \\"Ten\\" (1991) you can see the natural progression, how one seems to naturally follow the other. \\"Ten\\" may have, overall, better songs, but \\"Apple\\" has its strengths too. While both albums are terrific and have a classic-rock feel,  \\"Apple\\" seems to be a little more spontaneous, less slick, and certainly bluesier with stronger melodies. Stylistically, the sunny, hippie Wood is the polar opposite of the somber, baritone Vedder.<br /><br />Songs like \\"This Is Shangrila,\\" \\"Stardog Champion,\\" \\"Holy Roller\\" \\"Stargazer,\\" \\"Crown of Thorns\\" and \\"Come Bite the Apple,\\" (in which Wood prophetically sings \\"my future was in my hands `till I washed it all away\\") rival anything from Aerosmith's \\"Rocks\\" (1974) and are classic songs that are sadly, not recognized as the classics that they should be recognixed as.<br /><br />One can only guess what Mother Love Bone could have achived, but its frutless to contemplate. One thing is for sure though, Andrew Wood, Jeff Ament, Bruce Fairweather, Sone Gossard and Greg Gilmore left one great album, and that much is indisputable.<br /><br />On a side note: This single-disc compilation contains most of the \\"Shine\\" EP, and there is another 2-CD edition that contains the entire \\"Shine\\" EP. While these songs aren't asstrong as what the band would later do, they are worth listening to.

B001DU8T6S|5.0|I have to laugh at the criticism that TCR is \\"over-produced\\".  To me, there IS no such thing.  I expected nothing less than the lavish layers that are so characteristic of Queen in the studio, especially the 70's works.  I wasn't disappointed in that respect.  In fact, after playing the album daily for two months, one day I discovered the melodic bassline in Time To Shine.            It's hard to pick a favorite track.  A lot depends on my mood at the time..  I think TCR should come with a warning label - This CD should be played at 11!  (If you don't get the joke, it's from the satirical film, This Is Spinal Tap, and it means the highest possile volume.)  'Voodoo', and 'Through the Night', both reportedly Paul's compositions, are at the top of my list.  'TTN' seems to be written about his wife Cynthia, but to me, it is also a prayer (or a psalm, as it's set to music).  'Surf's Up... School's Out' is so different, and it's really grown on me.  LOVE the harmonica and synthesizer on it.  Though I have a hard time understanding the line following \\"wanna ride with you\\", supposedly \\"this ride still runs\\", but it sounds more like \\"this ride's too rough\\".    My least fav is 'Small'.  I have difficulty identifying with the sentiment, and I don't care much for the Macbeth-ish synthesizer in it.  And the chorus sounds a bit like a bunch of drunken blokes in a pub.  'Call Me' has the catchiest hook on TCR, and sounds like a Deacy ditty.  The line \\"get myself a wife or two\\" is classic; and the laugh at the end sums it all up for exactly what it is, a lighthearted, fun, silly piece.  But the kind of \\"cheesy\\" guitar solo throws it off a bit, like it tries a little too hard to be what my brother deemed as \\"a goofy song\\".  And while 'Warboys' kicks some serious guitar a**, I can't listen to it when I'm fighting a migraine (but it's not as \\"bad\\" as Chinese Torture).  It's a shame 'We Believe' didn't come out six months prior to the album, beause it seems to be written for PresidentObama, and would've made a great campaign theme song.  The structure is deceptively simple, and builds powerfully, like Ravel's 'Bolero'.  Some feel it's \\"too preachy\\", but I don't find that the case.  'Time To Shine' is also a great, uplifting number that would've been Obama worthy.  And 'All Things That Glitter' would be a nice one for some female figure skater to use (as have 'Who Wants To Live Forever' and other Queen songs over the years).    On the negative side, I don't care for 'small reprise' at all.  Maybe minus the vocals it would be okay.  But I think the sea sounds of waves and gulls would've made a stronger \\"organic\\" ending, just fading soothingly off, and harkening back to the sounds of the creation and the eerie whale noises at start of TCR.    I also wish that Brian sang 'Still Burnin'.  It kind of sounds like him on the first few lines.  And it would've been nice to hear more of Roger's singing, too.  I'm glad they took turns on 'SINT', even though I think it's more poignant when Rog sang it alone in concert.  But I'm happy they kept it to that one song.  I think even more vocal harmonies throughout might've made it feel more like a Queen album.  I really like the way Bri's voice pops out on C-lebrity.  There are other moments like that on TCR, but you have to really listen for them.  I can understand when Freddie was terminally ill why they \\"let\\" him sing almost all the vocals, but maybe a little more B+R on TCR would've made it more Q + PR, instead of the reverse.                     I think they were wise to drop the cover version of 'Runaway' from TCR.  I like the guitar work, but it wouldn't have added anything to the flow.  On the whole, this album has made me a very happy camper, getting me through what is turning out to be one of the snowiest and coldest winters on record.  I'm hoping that there will be more to come, including a tour on the other side of the pond!

B00177Y9ZC|1.0|I truly believe that some movies actually make you stupid. Jumper is such a movie. Watch it and feel your I.Q. plummet. [spoiler alert]  Here's the plot:  1) Guy (abandoned by mother at age 5) can teleport anywhere.  2) He robs banks and lives well.  3) He discovers another jumper and is pursued by a murderous group of \\"jumper-killers\\" called paladins.   4) He eludes the paladins, runs off with his high school sweetheart and discovers that his mother was one of the paladins.  Cue music. Wait for sequel. Egad.  There is so much stupidity here it's hard to know where to start. Here's a thought for good and bad guys alike -- buy a gun. The paladins use some kind of electrified harpoon gun and the jumpers....well...they just run. And jump. And run some more. Oh, and if you get the chance to kill someone who is actively hunting you and is willing to kill your familiy to find you -- kill them. Don't \\"jump\\" them somewhere and leave them alive. If only because they'll show up in the sequel.   There is much more, but I have to stop because I feel myself getting dummer jus thinkin about it.

B0000AMRJD|1.0|Where do I begin? This is maybe the cheeziest movie of the cheeziest decade in film history. The synthesized noodling of Moroder alone should qualify it for some kind of kitsch trophy. The mise en scene, the ketchuppy violence, the plot holes, the cartoonish feel of the whole thing... One gets the impression that it wasn't just the characters hosing up white stuff.      And the extras on disc two, oh my dears, there's one that's a documentary featuring Snoopy Doggy Style, or whatever his name is, along with a clutch of other Rhodes scholars waxing poetic about how much this movie means to them and how it's the goodest movie ever, word up. Talk about high comedy. It's a kind of modern mythology for the brain-dead. Tony Montana is a hero for the kind of people who couldn't spell \\"cat\\" if you spotted them the c and the a. I guess Pauline Kael summed it up best: \\"The whole feeling of the movie is limp.\\"
B001DVBZ4K|5.0|This is a fun movie.Just every element of it ( Except one) is so very Seuss-ian, that it recalls memories of all those years ago for me, and yet the way the film has been done, it brings it right into the current period.Whilst the Adults may Love the Commentary, and some of the extras that explain the attention to detail, the kids may just get into the total fun of the Whimsy and awesome fun that is Dr. Seuss, and dare I say it, the time-less fun that is the tales of Dr. Seuss. And the look of the two worlds is totally appropriate, even the music is elemental, and very   much within the tone of the story.  My Big Gripe in the main film is the \\"anime\\" sequence, but since they kept that in because in test runs they had kids spurt soda out their nose, I guess that seems a suitably whimsical reason to keep it in, if somewhat anachronistic.    The Audio Stories ( In the Gift set only, although you can buy the longer set of these stories elsewhere) is excellent, as an adult who bought the items for myself, I still love them. And Horton as a Plush Toy is superb. The Packaging is just brilliant as well.    The DVD has been done well( the Double DVD), and the commentary is excellent and does not make you feel like you are in film school. The extras are pretty much mostly good, except for some of the preachy stuff, but I guess if the film has a point then the preachy extras have a point too, so thats the reason for them being there.

0316017922|5.0|There is no other observer of our times quite like Malcolm Gladwell. His books are impossible to categorize. OUTLIERS has portions on sports, history, social sciences, education and business. The reader is never quite sure where he's heading, but Gladwell has a knack for discovering interesting social phenomena and drawing fascinating parallels. He is criticized for borrowing from other works, but Gladwell doesn't claim original research. He notices interesting studies, salient features and corroborative pieces of history. When combined, these illuminate how we have arrived and give us clues for a future course.     The gist of this little book is that exceptional people become that way for a host of reasons beyond their control. For professional athletes, it may be the month of their birth. For business tycoons, the decade is more important. Needless to say, success is effected by numerous vicissitudes in law, custom and geography. We can never quite be sure when our personal contributions will yield significant returns. I have always had an intuitive feeling that our relative \\"success\\" was beyond control. Most important in my assessment of society was the great number of talented people who were almost successful, but were impeded by a weak link. By that, I mean a flaw in their character, a disability, an addiction or a random misfortune that foiled advancement. Do we not all know many near-great individuals?     For dramatic reasons, successful people are loathe to admit the element of chance in their accomplishments. Many biographers prefer to lionize their subjects by suggesting that their achievements were the inevitable outcome of indomitable will, sage reason or masterful insight. Please. Can we not outgrow such fairy tales? It seems to me that Gladwell's speculation is politically loaded. Another book could be written abou how sociological views effect political preferences. But, I will baldly posit that if you think Gladwell is mainly correct, you are a liberal. If his thinking doesn't touch you, you are a conservative.

B000AMJG4Y|1.0|I have to say this is one of the most bizarre films I've ever seen, it utterly makes no sense. You can't just substitute awesome CG action for a coherent story that is uninteresting and has no continuity to it whatsoever. Don't even bother with this movie unless you have played multiple FF games in the past as it will make no sense at all if you have not and is full of the weird sensibilities that the japanese creators of the games have as well as the strange modern japanese sensibilities in general.    The previous FF CG film was great, it had a coherent story that didn't require a detailed knowledge of the FF world and had normal people in it as well as a focused story, this has none of that. It's all over the map with some planet life force and these new age ninja slacker japanese types asking about mother, whatever that means. This film is only good for showing just how beautiful you can make a CG film, like something they play on a huge LCD at a game convention for hours, it's not by any means entertainment that most people in the USA would get anything out of.
B00064AM6C|1.0|I am VERY disappointed in Amazon.  I have been using them for some time but this outrages me!  This DVD is $9.99 at Newbury Comics!!!  BUT Amazon was selling it new for $200.00 and used for $99.99.  I thought because of the pricing that it was a rare DVD or had something special to it and I purchaed it for my fiance for Christmas since he loves the White Stripes.   The concert is very bad quality and I could not understand why it was priced so high or what was special about it.  You can imagine how disappointed, duped and outraged I felt that this very same DVD is only $9.99 at Newbury Comics.  It is in BAD taste and is stealing from your customers to allow this to be sold for $200.00.    I am not happy.  And frankly, I want my $100.00 back or I wont be shopping at Amazon every again.  And whoever sold me this piece of junk, you are a thief.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Daniel Day Lewis is a genius. No one else could have played this part as well as he did. If you don't have this movie already, you need to get it. The story is amazing, the plot engrossing, and the acting top notch. The best movie I've seen in years.
B00003CX9W|5.0|It's easy for people now to be unaware of just what a miracle Fantasia is.  It's been 68 years or so since it was released, and most people tend to focus only on the events of their own lifetimes.  For those unaware, Fantasia was a huge gamble for Disney.  It was the first feature-length animated film, and the first film of any kind with stereo sound.  There was a huge effort to outfit the theaters for it, and resistance from theater owners over the expense.  The classical music it embodied was not what the average man in the street preferred.  The film opened to critical - and box office - disdain.  But Walt wasn't trying to satisfy only the mass audiences of 1940, he wanted to hit one out of the park - one for the ages.  And, he largely succeeded.    Disney originally called it 'The Concert Film', which shows what the intent was.  To let audiences experience the beauty and majesty of great music by giving them a new way to perceive it.  Visually.  Fantasia is a visual concert of eight pieces of music, in order, 'Toccata and Fugue in D Minor' by Johann Sebastian Bach, 'The Nutcracker Suite' by Tchaikovsky, 'The Sorcerer's Apprentice' by Paul Dukas, 'The Rite of Spring' by Igor Stravinsky, 'The Pastoral Symphony' by Beethoven, 'Dance of the Hours' by Ponchielli, 'Night on Bald Mountain' by Moussorgsky, and 'Ave Maria' by Franz Schubert.    The score is performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski; the segments are introduced by host Deems Taylor.  Taylor gives a brief background on each piece, and explains a bit of what the artists were trying to do with it, interpret a definite story inherent in the music or allow their imaginations free range to fantasize.    In creating Fantasia, Disney allowed his artists a much greater range of freedom than normal. It was usual at the time for an animation studio to have a set of 'ground rules' in place regarding things such as the permissible color palettes in use.  For Fantasia, the limits were removed and the artists were encouraged to experiment and get creative.  Supposedly, one animator used jelly from his sandwich to get just the right color.    The film starts perhaps a bit slowly, with Toccata and Fugue given a more timid and less imaginative rendering than it deserves, but the rest of the film, from Nutcracker to Ave Maria, will take your breath away, climaxing with a near-terrifying version of Walpurgisnacht in 'Night on Bald Mountain', segueing into a calming return to the world of sanity and daylight with 'Ave Maria'.    If you've never seen Fantasia, give yourself a treat.  Pick this up and watch it some evening.  Turn out the lights, stifle all interruptions, and immerse yourself in beautiful, glorious music and artwork.
0810979772|5.0|This was a gift for my grandsons and they love it more than the regular Whimpy Kid books
0967984602|5.0|Excellent, affordable, the first steps are important, this is the place to start, put it on Kindle.
0440241413|4.0|It was kind of funny when I began reading this book. I absolutely love to shop...and the twist and turns seem like something I could definitely relate to. It was a very fun book to read. I am looking forward to reading the next shopaholic book...on its way in the mail. :)
0380977273|4.0|Even being familiar with Ray Bradbury, I must confess this might be the most bizarre book that I have ever read.  As a tale of youth that spins frightfully out of control, Bradbury gives readers a deep look into the soul of man.  But even as Bradbury's metaphoric device comes full circle, one may feel that their equilibrium is corrupted.    Jim and Will are the typical childhood pairing.  Jim is rougher and perhaps more streetwise, while Will is somewhat naive.  In the story, Will's father gives a sense of balance as the carnival reeks havoc on the town.  Though the intentions of the carnival appear innocent at first, the boys are quick to note something peculiar.  At the center of the mayhem is the carousel.  As Will's father keenly observes, the carnival's power preys on the greed of people as note on page 152 of the 1970 printing.  And once one gets what they want, they will find something else to want.  Thus, a slave to the sideshow is created.    This may be the type of book that requires thought and reflection for the reader to fully appreciate.  While some of the sequences may be too fantastic for some readers, the overall picture is quite intriguing.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Very happy with this transaction, but we havent gotten to watch the movie yet! Ive heard only good things about it though, and we look forward to seeing it. Thanks Amazon!!
B0002IQEHI|1.0|My son (34) requested this for his Christmas gift. When he received it the DVD was defective, freezing up about half-way through.  He then ordered one on his own, and this one did the same thing.  Amazon is very good about refunds, but apparently there is a problem with this DVD.  I hope Amazon gets this worked out with its supplier, saving customers the hassle of shipping it back.
B00009R86L|5.0|This shoulder pad is great. It keeps the bag right where you want it. The rubber is wedge shaped and that helps the pad rest evenly on the shoulder blade. And the rubber is soft so it \\"kind of sticks there!\\"
B0015AARJI|5.0|My son really loves this controller.  He can sit on his bed or at his desk and play the game.  I should have gotten this controller for him when I purchased the game console.   Very much worth the money.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is such a great film. Very authentic. A very fine piece of work. I had read McCullough's book and thought it stayed very close to his work. I have not been so impressed with a film in such a long time. Kudo's to everyone responsible.
B000YABYLA|2.0|I watched this movie with a constant \\"quizzical\\" expression on my face. It made light of teenge pregnancy so much so that I would never recommend it for anyone under the age of 18. Juno gets pregnant by her friend. She continues to refer to her unborn baby as \\"the thing\\" and shows no emotional attatchment to it whatsoever, makes the choice of giving \\"the thing\\" up for adoption without hesitation. The only sincere emotion her character shows are brief tears shortly after giving birth in the hospital. The movie ends with Juno riding her bike over to her friends (baby daddy) house so they can both sit on the front stoop playing guitar and singing a happy song together. Hmmmm. Realistic? Hardly. No post-partum depression, no agonizing over guilt, no emotions whatsoever that most females show during pregnancy or adoption. I hope teenage girls do not get the impression that adoption is so easy, as displayed by this character and her family. Although this movie had some funny parts, I just cant get over how little reality it displayed.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I've seen B.O.B. several times on DVD. The extra content is very informative. Most of the filming is grainy but there are more clear shots (that look priceless on Blu-Ray) than you realize.     My only complaint is the DVD's are kind of tricky to get out of the insert.    As far as the story goes, I wish they would have followed the book more closely. There are a few discrepancies. I also wish they would have mentioned how Sobel blotched his own suicide later in his life and then finally finished him self off.     NOTE>> I have a Samsung BD-P 1500 blu-ray player. After the last firmware update it would no longer play the extra PIP commentary correctly.
