B00005AAFS|5.0|Almost four years after their massive breakthrough \\"Sehnsucht\\", Rammstein followed their success with \\"Mutter\\". The album is a departure from the sound which the band began in Herzeleid and perfected in Sehnsucht, as it follows a much more Orchestral, Gothic, and Epic sound over the Electronica-drenched Techno-Metal of the past. It follows a path suggested by songs such as \\"Klavier\\" and \\"Spiel Mit Mir\\" The change is evident even in the very first seconds of the album, as the explosive opener \\"Mein Herz Brennt\\" is driven by a powerful string section. While the album is less heavy than the previous (There's nothing as heavy as \\"Bestrafe Mich\\" or \\"Buck Dich\\", except for maybe \\"Rein Raus\\"), it still fairly METAL record, filled with pounding riffs that are effectively countered by beautiful melodies and arrangements. <br /> <br />Song by Song review: <br /> <br />1) Mein Herz Brennt: A hell of an opener, this track announces Rammstein's new fascination with orchestras complementing their unique brand of Metal. The chorus is one of the best examples of strings used in metal I've ever heard. Trully a powerful song. 9/10 <br /> <br />2) Links 2 3 4: A song with a driving rythm and a military beat, this was the first Rammstein song I heard and it turned me into a fan. It's fairly heavy and the soaring chorus is great! 8.5/10 <br /> <br />3) Sonne: A fan favourite, and definitely one of the best Rammstein songs. Sonne combines a stomping riff and quiet verses with an increadible heart-stopping chorus and melody. The outro is amazing. If you're doubting buying the album, get a hold of this song; it'll erase all doubt. A Gem. 10/10 <br /> <br />4) Ich Will: A crowd-interaction song that is perfect for concert settings! This insanely anthemic track is another highlight of the album. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />5) Feuer Frei!: This track is most reminiscent of the Herzeleid era, kind of similar to Asche Zu Asche (but not as good). It is a fast kind of catchy single, but one of the lessersongs on the album. 6/10 <br /> <br />6) Mutter: The title track is another heart-stopping song. A power-ballad if there ever was one, the verses sound filled with sadness (and the lyrics reinforce it), the chorus riff is amazing, and the bridges are increadible. The orchestration is top-notch 10/10 <br /> <br />7) Spielhur: The \\"epic\\" of the album, a song with very sad lyrics and creepy choruses with melancholic instrumentation. However, it's a little too slow and long. 7/10 <br /> <br />8) Zwitter: Fast and catchy, but nothing particularly special about this song. 7/10 <br /> <br />9) Rein Raus: A fairly heavy song, it has some funky samples of sex noises (the title means \\"In-Out\\", if that tells you anything). The melodic parts are kinda nice. In my opinion, Spielhur, Zwitter, and this song are the low-points of the album. Not really bad, but simply not on par with such genius as Sonne or Mutter. 7/10 <br /> <br />10) Adios: The band gets back on track with this fast song, which is sort of a better version of Zwitter, it's deeper and sadder-sounding. The transitions from quiet acoustic to heavy explosion are great. 9/10 <br /> <br />11) Nebel: The ballad-closer Nebel finishes the album in a deeply sad, melancholic song. The strings accentuate the dark tone. It's all very epic and gothic. A great closer. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />If you liked their newest release \\"Reise, Reise\\" and still don't have Mutter, then definitely get it. If you're a fan of Sehnsucht and Herzeleid, give it a try, it's different, but decidedly RAMMSTEIN, and decidedly AWESOME.
0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond explores the rise of ancient civilizations, and looks deep beyond just the proximate factors that so many are accustomed to. Why did ancient civilizations arise when they did? Why were some areas more agriculturally prosperous than others? Why was it the Europeans that colonized the other continents and not the other way around?  <br />Such questions are explored, delved into in a comprehensive, thorough manner (despite the fact Diamond is cramming thousands of years of ancient history/geography into a 400-page book) and, ultimately, answered.  <br />Jared Diamond's research, especially of New Guinea and the New Guineans, is interesting. It is clear he has spent a lot of time learning about New Guinea (how it used to be part of Greater Australia) and how New Guineans live now (and in ancient times). It seems Diamond has been devoted to this cause for years and this is one reason why Guns, Germs, and Steel is so effective. <br />I also like how Diamond explains the concepts in his books in an accessible manner, ensuring that other people (who do not necessarily share his academic background) can understand his book. Nevertheless, Jared Diamond substantiates his facts with well-researched, plausible, and valid evidence.  <br /> <br />One is guaranteed to learn much about history, different cultures and how they arose, geography, and much more. It is all packed into this 400-something-paged book, a Pulitzer Prize winner titled Guns, Germs, and Steel. <br />I am not a heavy non-fiction reader, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the few non-fiction pieces I've picked up for awhile. Even for a heavy fiction reader who wouldn't normally read non-fiction, this book is compellingly fascinating in its attempt to explain the trajectory of ancient societies and how those courses affect the modern world today.  <br />I highly recommend this book to people interested in such topics, or even if you have no real interest and just want to read an interesting, engaging non-fiction book. This book will edify your knowledge on things that matter and topics worth thinking about. <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This was a refreshing and beautiful version of the old tale and while the stage-version will always be dear to me, the movie, on its own, is just as good. What I love about the movie is its sincerity and simplicity, meaning that it doesn't pretend to be an \\"operatic\\" piece and that the director dared to go as far as casting a young girl as Christine and that he did not use a deformity that was monster-like or disgusting to look at. Of course the Phantom must be deformed but where exactly does imagination (Buquet's tale to the ballet-girls) end and reality begin? Gerard Butler, Emmy Rossum and Patrick Wilson were fabulous in this movie (Though not flawless vocally, but do I care? If the result is a ravishing as this, who cares about a cracked high note or two?) and I can only urge you to get the DVD and be mesmerized. How sad that so many who love it now missed in on the big screen... That experience was MIND-BOGGLING!
0060512806|5.0|I never thought I would get through 1008 pages as fast as I did. Stephenson artfully wove three different storylines spanning 50+ years into an enjoyable and engaging read.<br /><br />All the major characters are the kind of people you wish you would meet during your life--interesting, full of life, and just a little sideways.
B000268QB2|4.0|What was the last album that you can recall being total genius and a masterpiece? For me it was OK Computer. Nothing has come close since, not even Radiohead themselves. The question is, did OK Computer spawn a new crop of Radiohead wannabe's. Sure it did. And the music listening public should be grateful for that. Unfortunately any attempt to copy genius is doomed to fall short but in this case falling short is still miles above the mindless drivel that has plagued modern music for years. And now that there has been some space and time since OK Computer, the sound of bands following that thin thread is sounding more and more original. Soon the comparisons will end and the music will be judged on it's own merit. Wouldn't that be a novel approach? <br />Keane has written some stunningly beautiful songs. Some are so appealing that I fear they will lose their appeal too quickly. The melodies are the real strength of this album. Lyrically there is nothing that warrants any serious contemplation. Judging Hopes And Fears as a work without referencing 4 or 5 other bands, I think it's a fine collection of songs and I'm looking forward to hearing what Keane does next.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Here we have another masterpiece.I love this album as well.The bonus track \\"Turn on your light\\"is an awesome ballad.If you do not have this remastered cd with bonus tracks.Buy it!!!
B00003CX5P|1.0|STAR WARS EPISODE I: The Phantom Storyline <br /> <br />On the small planet of Naboo, the Trade Federation organised a blockade with GIGANTIC, FULLY ARMED SPACESHIPS to protest against the new law on taxation. <br />This is obviously reason enough for the Galactic Senate to send two highly decorated Jedi as embassadors to lead the negotiations ... <br /> <br />And this is obviously enough for George Lucas to build an entire Star Wars film around it. <br />The Trade Federation, led by two frogs with a borderline racist accent, accepts help from Darth Sidious for no obvious reason, and vice versa. Think about it: the film suggests that the galaxy had to suffer greatly under the dominion of the Sith. And yet these braindead frogs ask the powerful Lord Sidious for help? And he accepts it? But I'm sure trading fits into Darth Sidious' evil scheme ... somehow. <br />So, eventually Sidious orders them to invade Naboo and sign some ominous contract. Why? Because he's EVIL, you see? <br /> <br />But there's no point in asking; as soon as the two Jedi, Qui- Gon Jinn and his padawan Obi- Wan Kenobi, escape the clutches of the federation and land on Naboo, the movie loses, or willfully abandons its plot. About 20 minutes into the film. Bravo! What did you do during the last 16 years, George? <br />After 20 minutes, the movie is only busy with telling us why we're going to the next location, but there's no real goal to look forward to. <br /> <br />The characters are equally bleak and lack substance, but let them introduce themselves (gone are the days in which a character is defined by its actions): <br /> <br />Qui- Gon Jinn: \\"My name's Qui Gon Jinn. I'm only spouting supposedly wise lines during the entire film. Oh, and I get killed, but you already know that if you own the Soundtrack. And I'm also explaining that Midichlorian dreck, which ruins every ounce of mystery Star Wars had.\\" <br /> <br />Obi- Wan: \\"I'm Obi- Wan Kenobi, and I say hardly anything in this film. My onlypurpose is to answer my master and to kill Darth Maul.\\" <br /> <br />Jar Jar Binks: \\"Meesa Jar Jar Binkse, meesa in big doodoo, meesa stealing screen time, meesa worst character ever to be conceived by mankind! And meesa acting obnoxiously!\\" <br /> <br />Qui Gon: \\"Just do it like me, don't act at all! I don't move my face, even when our submarine is stuck in the mouth of a giant monster fish as big as a house.\\" <br /> <br />Queen Amidala aka Padme: \\"I'm Padme Queen Amidala. I can't move my face and I'm changing my clothes every 5 minutes.\\" <br /> <br />Anakin Skywalker: \\"Am I not cuuuute? Isn't it fantastically satisfying when a whole planet gets rescued by a slapstick moment of a 7- year old kid like me?\\" <br /> <br />Darth Maul: \\"...\\" *rolls eyes* <br /> <br /> <br />That's basically all there's to say about them. Every actor seems like a foreign object in this film. So wooden, so irritatingly bland. My favourite line comes from Padme: \\"IaskYouNoIbegYouToHelpUs\\". <br /> <br />So, after a series of distinct events, held together by the ambition to let two hours pass and arrive at the end credits, we get to the big battle. A small group tries to capture the head of the trade federation inside the Naboo palace, while a bunch of bad looking, worse lit CGI figures (in the movie referred to as \\"the Gungans\\" and \\"the droids\\") battle outside on a huge, empty grass field, in broad daylight, which only serves to make the battle look even more fake. <br />The cool, dark fight between Darth Maul, Qui- Gon and Obi- Wan, the best scene in the film (no surprise) gets constantly intercut with the obnoxious, infantile jiggling around of Jar Jar Screenkiller Binks and Padme's purposeless search for the trading king. <br />Eventually, Anakin manages to blow up the entire commando ship of the federation by accident, the droids fall to the ground, Obi- Wan kills Darth Maul, the day is saved, and we don't care. <br /> <br />Then we have a little epilogue. At Qui- Gon's funeral, Mace Windu and Yoda talk about the Sith: <br /> <br />Mace: \\"Which one was destroyed, the apprentice or ... the master?\\" <br />- close- up Chancellor Palpatine - <br />Audience: \\"That was subtle.\\" <br /> <br />WHAT was his film all about? Why do we have to have the big battle? Why was Naboo invaded? Taxes? Come on ... <br /> <br />Furthermore, we learn that Jedi are nothing more than a bunch of spiritual cops, there to lead negotiations and to go rampant once in a while. <br />Hell, in the original Star Wars, \\"guardians of peace and justice\\" meant something heroic and romantic because there was an *actual threat* for the Jedi to take care of. <br /> <br />What's the threat here? The Jedi paying more taxes? <br /> <br />The celebration song at the end is so infinitely sillier and inappropriate than the already obnoxious Ewok chanting that it chases you out of the room. <br /> <br />And the worst thing is that this flick is just a warm- up for the gigantic turkey that would later be known as \\"Attack Of The Clones\\" ...
B00080ZG10|1.0|Depressing. <br />Banal. <br />Sickeningly PC. <br />Too long. <br />Scorsese *&* Hollyweird's completely lost it. <br /> <br />If one *must* see this atrocity then may I respectfully suggest it be *rented* it first? <br />Don't purchase it new.

B000A59PMO|5.0|No description could ever really capture the deliciously dark, twisted, tangled world of Veronica Mars. Suffice it to say that the acting is absolutely incredible, from its stunning title character (Kristen Bell) to its quirky guest stars (Harry Hamlin). Not to mention the intensely compelling Jason Dohring. They, with the help of some brilliant writing, can alternately elicit both uncontrollable giggles for their cleverness and gut-wrenching sympathy for their heartbreakingly real turmoil.    Seriously, this show has completely spoiled me for all other shows.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|I remember when this came out, hearing it through the sound system of the Stanley Theater in between bands on tour like Starz, UFO, and Rush.  But without the aid of a DJ, I had no idea who had remade \\"You Really Got Me\\" by The Kinks with such a great and lively guitar part.  The vocals were great too.  I finally found out it was Van Halen.  All I can say is what an album.  I wore this out on vinyl the summer of 1976.  The weakest songs on here are \\"Jamie's Cryin'\\" and \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\".  Did you hear what I said?  Those are the weakest tracks and they ain't bad.  Everything has just such a flow on the recording that I never find myself ever advancing to the next track.  Unbelievable.  The classic VH songs are hear:  Runnin with the Devil, Eruption....just look at the track listing.  You already know most of these.  This is the album that introduced the world to the 4 members of Van Halen, mainly the guitar playing (or inventing) of Eddie Van Halen and the one and only David Lee Roth.  What a combination and this recording shows just that.  The band Van Halen never released an album or CD that is as consistent as this, later releases always contained some filler and those were some short albums in duration, mostly around a half an hour.  If for some reason you don't own this, pick up the Remastered version and be prepared to enjoy some classic Hard Rock, even Heavy Metal music!  You won't be sorry!
B00001OH7N|3.0|First of all a warning: if you're thinking about buying this album because you reckon The Man Who Sold The World is a great song, forget it.  Unlike its predecessor, Space Oddity, this is a rock album (of the hard variety).  Bowie, apparently, had little interest in this album once the songs were written and it ended up essentially being guitarist Mick Ronson's album... and don't it show! <br /> <br />However, some of the songs are excellent - Width Of A Circle (whose motif Primal Scream ripped off years later), All The Madmen and the title track are superb songs and Bowie's voice goes into histrionics throughout (particularly in Supermen - probably the weirdest and scariest vocal performance ever committed to vinyl).  And After All was probably written after smoking a pound of hash... a song so mellow it nearly isn't there. <br /> <br />All in all, not a bad album, but probably more for fans than the casual listener.
B00005K9LK|5.0|This is by far one of the greatest albums/Cd of all time.This is one you can listen over and over and not get tired of it.The bonus track Prisoner of your eyes is an awsome ballad.This album is truly a masterpiece.
B00005JN0T|4.0|Making a return to form after the disappointing sequels MIB 2 and Bad Boys 2, Will Smith gives his best performance to date in Alex Proyas' I, ROBOT. Like a cross between Metropolis and A.I, the story carries the action, rather than depending on special effects and stunts. Sure, the `robots created by man go bezerk and turn on their masters' premise is hardly original, but thankfully by process of eliminating the predictable clich&eacute;s, the film manages to outshine previous cinematic future-world robotic chaos dramas. Marco Baltrami's techno-schizoid musical score shifts the film out of first gear, and William Hoy's slick editing tempers the film's fast-paced action scenes. Simon Duggan's stunning cinematography veils the film in an eternal dark city-slick that is both easy on the retinas and appears gloomy at times. And despite some action scenes feeling a little too reminiscent of previous Sci Fi efforts, I, Robot still has some fantastically contrived frenetics.<br /><br />But it's not all about action. Smith (As detective Del Spooner) delivers a performance that, while not Oscar worthy, still manages to rise above expectations. Especially considering how ill suited he is for the role. And Bridget Moynahan adds much to her admittedly secondary role. One of Isaac Asimov's most intriguing SF tales, the adaptation has been handled well, inserting scenes and characters that give more meat to the story without losing sight of the original message.<br /><br />There are flaws: Some exposition scenes run long and become tedious, and while there is solid action throughout the film's lengthy running time, the finale feels somewhat overcooked. However all this is small beans, because it's not about the action quota, instead focusing on a more personal level. Rising above the sub-genre's restrictions while simultaneously providing a cerebral mystery movie, this has everything that a SF fan could want. One of 2004's most satisfying films, I, Robot does more than linger in the memory for a while, it asks some very important questions about the frailty of humanity and queries the strength of our very existence. The DVD has plenty of extras to satisfy the most ardent of aficionados, including behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, trailers and more. This is a highly recommended addition to anyone's DVD collection.a while, it asks some very important questions about the frailty of humanity and queries the strength of our very existence.

B000A88F22|3.0|Ok, so I am a huge Britney fan, but this show really was the most boring, useless, unflattering show ever! With that said I will still by the DVD and am excited that it is coming out because of the bonus materials. The Bonus CD will be enough for it because \\"someday\\" and \\"chaotic\\" are both really good songs. Stick to Music and Acting Britney and leave reality television to the has beens.
B00008OLIO|5.0|I have owned a CD of this record since 1990.  I owned the LP prior to that.  When I saw this with bonus tracks and remastered, well I just had to have it.  If you are not familiar with their debut recording, pick this up now.  It has all that Shout at the Devil had plus a lot more.  There is not a bad song on here, and now there are bonus tracks.  Sorry, had to lick my lips for a second.  The sound quality has improved and the video of Live Wire shows what the band were trying to do very early on.  Kind of like Twisted Sister meets Kiss meets Sweet.  The Crue are out on the road and heading to Pittsburgh at the end of August so I am sure new fans will be looking to pick up the old stuff.  Rumuor has it that they are playing this album in its entirety on the tour.  Listening to this makes one realize where the Crue kind of lost sight of the tracks there for awhile later in their career.  This is the most consistent Crue record ever.  Raw, energized, and hungry they were.  Buy it and find out.  Great stuff!
B00001OH7M|3.0|The first of his \\"rock\\" albums is rather unique in the Bowie canon, featuring, as it does, mainly narrative lyrics accompanied by acoustic instruments.  For anyone who reckons Bowie is all artifice or that he can only write abstract lyrics, listen to this and re-evaluate. <br /> <br />The songs are, on the whole, rather fine.  Apart from the title track, standouts include Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud, Letter to Hermione and Memory Of A Free Festival (although there's a better, electric version doing the rounds).  The rest of the songs are pretty nice too. <br /> <br />It's a gentle introduction to David Bowie and listening to this album, you'd never believe there was a glam rock monster waiting to be spawned.
B00097DX3U|1.0|This band is just annoying. <br />Chris Cornell is more memorable for his styled moustache than the music on this album, their first was'nt half bad in fact quite good. But it should of been a one off collaberation. <br /> <br />All these songs are based around the lyrics and not the music, thats where the problem lies in todays music scene currently.
0451526384|4.0|Although Persuasion was an amazing book, it just did not add up to Jane Austen's other works. While not as silly as EMMA, it did not have the character development or interesting story line(s) of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Still, a good read, if you're an Austen or romance novel fan.
B00002SSRZ|4.0|well i finally heard it. even before the bass and drums kicked in i know it wasnt going to have much. its a trebly mix, but makes the instruments sound much more crispy which i like. <br /> <br />i was tired of hearing the same mix on BMW and OCV. this is cool for santana fans that want more from music albums. the 5.1 mix is very great. <br /> <br />i like this better than the regular old album. <br /> <br />my only concern is i think they used a little noise reduction but im not 100 sure. for those of you that know what that is, i dont like it it unless something is really hissy but i doubt that was the case here.

B0007XT7V8|5.0|Unlike others, I like this cd alot better than the debut.  The sound is alot more original on this one, unlike on the first which sounded exactly like nickelback.  There are actually slow heartfelt songs such as hello lonely, the middle and since you've been gone, which is one of the best songs ive heard in a while.  Theres not as many standouts as the first cd,but is much more solid and catchy and say goodbye would be my best guess for the next single.  this cd Most likely will appeal to fans of country and rock.  I hate most of the crap thats played on the radio but i really liked this cd so i definantly suggest it.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Don't expect to hear a modern electric guitar wall of sound that you would typically hear from them. <br />They've reinvented themselves a bit. <br />Its not that bad, in fact its quite good album, it takes a while to get used to it, condsidering that this is Oasis. <br /> <br />Ther are not huge songs like \\"Stop Crying Your Heart Out\\" \\"Wonderwall\\" or \\"Live Forever\\", but every track on the album matters and that makes for their best album since \\"Whats the Story Morning Glory\\" despite sounding nothing like they've ever done. <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Haunting, melancholy, happy, singalong. it's all of those things, but more than that it is the best debut album since Roxy Music. It's THAT fresh.
B000002JSJ|5.0|Another fantastic LP from the English 4 piece.  <br />Kicks off with the epic 'Achilles Last Stand' standing at 10.25 seconds with some masterful guitar playing from Jimmy Page & wailing from Robert Plant. Add to that a fast bass line from John Paul Jones & a world or drums from Mr. Bonham quiet simply this could be the finest effort musically from them.  <br />Adding to that 'Nobody's Fault but Mine' this LP is really made for a good set of quality headphones.  <br /> <br />The rest is a good affair, though 'Tea for One' does feel a little too long & does have a similar feel to the far superior 'Since I've Been Loving You' from Led Zeppelin 3.  <br /> <br />
0395389496|5.0|I am an elementary education major at West Virginia State University.  I am currently taking Children's Literature with Prof. Roger Samples where we just completed a project on a Caldecott Medal winning book.  For my book, I read The Polar Express.  Not only was this a great book to read, but it was a great piece of artwork to look at as well.  The illustrations throughout the book seem as if they are off the wall of an art gallery.  The words help to add detail, but the illustrations really help to bring this story to life.  This story has shown me, as I am sure it has shown many others, that if we truly believe, we can all experience the same magic that the little boy did on Christmas Eve as he took a ride on the Polar Express.  The Polar Express is not just a book for children.  It is a book that everyone should take the time to read and become familiar with.  The Polar Express is one of the best children's books I have ever read.  I will be sure to have this one on the shelf of my classroom when I become a teacher.

B00005JNEI|4.0|Yes, sometimes his humor is pretty bad...and there are some pretty trite momments in the film. I believe his insights are nice (I mean, there nothing new, but good anyways)and its overall a film I enjoyed and agreed with. The only thing that irritates me is Micheal Moores obvious partisianship, which is what I believe causes many offensive reviews(and the reaction documenteries). I do not believe this film helped the situation in America, I would imagine it just fueld the fire and has caused more political rage in america(well, at least around my friends...obvisouly I do not know if it actually stirred up america). I can not consider Moore an actual socialist...if he has absolutly no tolerence for the people he (and I) disagree with; in this sence, he is just as bad as the people he mentions in his film. John Stuwart does a fabulous job of maintaining his princibles...yet being respectful and tolerent of others beliefs. F911 is a good film with good facts...I dont know why Micheal Moore thought it would be a good idea to promote such partisianship. A great film that (well what I consider great) that stays sommewhat un biased (yet with a small pinch of left in it) is Farmingville. Bowling for columbine is a very nice film too.

Never again or before had the band come together to create so many good songs, in fact 18 amazing songs, when it's truly hard to put 9 decent ones on an albm the Stones doubled that. This is concedered to be the greatest double album of all time, I I wouldnt dare argue with that title.<br /><br />Through this album The Rolling Stones dont venture into new teratory such as Reggea, Funk, or soul like they would later do, but instead they settle down in older familure structures like Country, Blues, R & B, and Rock and Roll and rather then settle realy they perfect. Through out this album featuring the 'classic' stones line up of Jagger/Richards/Taylor/Watts/Wyman, the band comes together and runs all all cylenders.<br /><br />The album opens with two of it's hardest rockers, 'Rocks Off' and 'Rip This Joint' both of which are Stones classics. i used to think If You Cant Rock Me was the best album opener but boy was I wrong, Rocks Off is Perfect! 'Shake You Hips,' an old blues cover is done perfectly here with great guitar worl and mick's signature vocals. 'Casino Boggie' is the perfect song to lead into the timeless 'Tumbling Dice' which just happens to be my all time favorite Rolling Stones song. The guitar is simply amazing and the lyrics are brilliant. The fact that Mick walked into a casino and thought of some way to relate poker to love is simply genius and the greatest primice for a song. 'Sweet Virginia' is a slower acoustic song with a great chorus and sets the pace for the next three songs. 'Torn And Frayed' 'Sweet Black Angle' and 'Loving Cup' are all slower ballads with power, though dont get me confused as saying they are power ballads because they are not. Sweet Black Angle features amazing acoustic playing by Mick Taylor and Keith Richards. Keith steps up to the mic to sing 'Happy,' which became a hit single and is to this day concidered one of the bands all time greatest songs. I have always loved when guitar players step up to the mic and sing because it usually makes for a great song especially with Keith, he never dissapoints! 'Turd On The Run' is a decent rocker but nothing to special. 'Ventalator Blues' is one of the all time greatest songs ever written, Im sure if you asked anyone who has ever heard the song they would tell you the same. Every time that song starts I stop what ever I am doing and listen to the song, which is one of the reasons I dont listen to this album in the car. Now 'I Just Want To See His Face' is a strange song that chants \\"I dont want to prey to Jesus, I just want to see his face' over and over again over some strange sounds. It seems dumb and tedeious I know but it really isnt. 'Let It Loose' is a pretty cool song but it just doesnt stand out on the album. 'On Down The Line' is one of my favorite songs on the album, featuring some of Mick Taylors all time best slide guitar work. This song kind of reminds me of Silver Train off the Stones' next album Goats Head Soup. 'Stop Breaking Down' is a traditional song that The Rolling Stones took and made all their own, I swear you would never know it was a traditional song if you hadnt heard it before. 'Shine A Lite' is a really cool song, Im not sure how to describe it or characterize it but just know that it is a great song. The album comes to an end with 'Soul Surviver' topping the album off at track eighteen. 'Soul Surviver' features some of Micks best vocals and a signature crowl that only he is capable of creating. The album ends where it begins leaving you wanting more!<br /><br />With all of this in mind how can you help dont wanting this album, I mean every song is good and I am telling you know you will never ifnd a Rolling Stones album better then this, I know your thinking well '.........' is a better album because I was the same way but once you give a listen to this masterpeace of rock and roll you will know that Exile On Main Street is the best! And as for guitar players, no guitar player should be with out this album, or at least one that has Tumbing Dice on it because guitar playing doesnt get batter then that. Highly, highly recomended!you will never ifnd a Rolling Stones album better then this, I know your thinking well '.........' is a better album because I was the same way but once you give a listen to this masterpeace of rock and roll you will know that Exile On Main Street is the best! And as for guitar players, no guitar player should be with out this album, or at least one that has Tumbing Dice on it because guitar playing doesnt get batter then that. Highly, highly recomended!
B0009HLDFU|1.0|How can dave grohl call the first disc on this album the most kick ass thing they've ever done, because quite simply it aint. <br />Monkey Wrench, Stacked Actors, Enough Space, All My Life rock harder than anything on this album, that also includes the horrible \\"Best of you.\\" <br /> <br />Dave Grohl might of made a kick arse record, but it lacks any melodies or direction as an album.
B000002IZM|4.0|An excellent soundtrack for an excellent movie. If you're looking for ambient synthy stuff, you've come to the right place. There are longish snippets of dialogue mixed into some of the tracks, but that's not necessarily a bad thing... it doesn't really bother me at all.
0345363132|5.0|A great read for those who enjoy historical fiction.  Ms. Penman's writing style will put you right in the midst of historical England.  My first time reading Ms. Penman's works...however...not my last!  At times one does get lost in which character is which but overall it's worth one's time and effort.  At times a bit graphic and not for the feint of heart.
B00005JNTX|4.0|I saw this movie not knowing much except it was almost exactly like the comic(camera angles, the character's looks, and the dialogue) and I never read the comics and had no idea they existed until this movie came out. I watched it and I actually enjoyed it for the most part, and I'm a girl. It was really fun to just watch (even if there was no audio)the black and white with certain things colored really worked and looked awesome on the big screen. I really enjoyed Marv's(Mickey Rourke) and Hartigan's(Bruce Willis) stories. They were the most interesting and fun to watch. Unfortunately Dwight's(Clive Owen) story was a real drag(thus why I give this 4 stars instead of 5 and why I say I liked this movie for the most part). I was so bored at that part and was glad it wasn't the last story. That would have been really bad to end the movie with that story. And the prostitutes were annoying too. But if I just ignore that part and focus on the rest of the movie I really really liked it even if it was violent and a \\"guy flick\\"(naked girls). I recommend this movie to adults only and those who don't care about violence, nudity, and swearing. If you are a parent and you let your kid watch this you are one messed up parent! This is totally NOT a kid flick! And it does deserve it's \\"R\\" rating and 18 years and up warning!
B00005JNSK|4.0|Seeing a re-make come out of the absolute classic that defined such a piece of my pre-pubescent youth gave me plenty of doubt that Mr. Depp could pull off anything like the original.  Yes, it has special effects, and some quite dandy music, but Johnny Depp does not unseat Gene Wilder; heavens no.  The Roald Dahl story is a great one; I think I now need to read the book.  It kept me aware of just when this thing might end.  I liked the kids better in the original; Charlie is a pretty bland player, and Grandpa Joe in this one comes nowhere close to the great Jack Albertson.  Call me old fashioned, call me what you will, but I'll rate the original almost a whole star higher.  Make this one 3.9 stars.
B0006L16N8|1.0|the only songs that are good on this CD are the ones played on the radio, other than that, I felt this CD was way off base for Coldplay. I have both of Coldplay's other CD's and can play them over and over agian.....never tiring of his voice and sound. This one already went into back of the CD book, never to be played agian.
076790592X|5.0|This book is one of the most touching stories I have ever read.  It's thought provoking lessons teach the reader to live life to it's fullest just like Morrie.  It taught me to take in the simple pleasures in life and to say what feel to those I hold close, because you never know when we'll leave this world.  I strive to have Morrie's outlook on life and enjoyed the lessons introduced throughout the story.  This book is a must read as you are hooked from the very first paragraph.  You will laugh, you will cry, but most of all you will learn some of the greatest lessons in leading a happy, satisfying life.
B00004T6V4|5.0|The first time I saw the cover, I was a bit skeptical of it's 70's music persona. Then, after watching it five times, I realized it became one of my favoriates. Like the others, I had to search for the soundtrack. At last, I had it in my hands, listening it for hours. Both for the movie and the soundtrack I give it an A++ and 5 stars. Yes, I cried too. How will the others feel about the movie and soundtrack? We wait with baited breath.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|Key Words: Dance, Fun, Club, Party, Feel Good. That's what this album was about..I noticed with each Britney cd her sound evolves only for the better. Her first Cd was ballads and Bubble Gum Pop. Her second cd Bubblegum ballads, yet, some more edgy stuff. 3rd, is where the urban beats and more dance music comes in, and finally In the Zone, is a full party, turn up the volume anthem CD, where you can tell this is a lot more her and less mediocre. People would be suprised how much this album would grow on them. So here's my opinion on the songs bit by bit if you'd like to know: <br /> <br /> <br />1. Me Against The Music -The first time I heard this song on the radio,I didn't like it at first. It wasn't what I expected, I thought it was kinda all over the place, but the more I listened to it, the more it grows on you afterawhile. It's not like most pop tracks on the radio, it kinda has an fast paced, edgy pulsing beat to it..Cool dance song. 5/5 <br /> <br />2. I Got that Boom Boom -eh....I did like this this song at first, it was catchy.(You can always depend on Britney for catchy pop songs) but after the next few listens, it doesn't have that much substance. The lyrics are a bit mediocre. Nothing special, but not the worst. It's ok. 3/5 <br /> <br />3. Showdown -A lot better than track three. A provogative, mellow, sexy kinda song. Has a unique blend of sound and chorus in it. The lyrics though aren't all that amazing, but overall, this song isn't a lot like most pop music. 3/5 <br /> <br />4. Breathe On Me -I liked this one a lot! I didn't expect to hear this on a Britney Album....It definetly has that club party type feel to it. Something you would hear in the clubs. If you like Kylie Minogue's music, this one might appeal to you. Has a techno feel it it. 5/5 <br /> <br />5. Early Mornin -A song about the morning after partying, and what happened the night before. It was interesting, The raping chorus is pretty cool, and it's also a neat one to dance to. Although,again. Not her best track, but it's a fun one. 3/5 <br /> <br />6. Toxic -Imagine we've all heard this song by now. The song really is toxic though. As much as this song was played, I did not get sick of it. It's a classic Britney song about a love she can't get enough of. The violins weren't sampled eitheir which is pretty amazing. This is just a unique dance/pop track. Interesting tones and vibe. 5/5 <br /> <br />7. Outrageous -Catchy. Fun. Feel good. Girly. The lyrics aren't <br />anything out of this world, but the chinese background music <br />is cool, and the song displays some energy. This is just a fun <br />one to dance and sing along to. As all her tracks are. Sing this <br />one in the car....B-) Flows nicely 3/5 <br /> <br />8. Touch Of my Hand -Masturbation. Yep, that's what its about. I thought it was about self confidence at first but its not. This song isn't slutty and sick eitheir. (think of Cyndi Laupers She-Bop, or Madonna's Like a virgin) The lyrics are done tasteful though. It also have that neat chinese flute sound to it as \\"Outrageous had.\\" A slower track. 4/5 <br /> <br />9. The Hook Up -I didn't get this one at first. Although, the more I listened to it, it gets better. Almost has a latin type vibe to it. I could have really pictured the video for this, would have had some great dance moves. This one will make you wanna dance and have fun. :) 4/5 <br /> <br />10. Shadow -Here's a ballad. Really pretty. The song is about <br />a guy who hides his true self and is really never reveals who he is. Her voice sounds really relaxed, yet emotional and beautiful. 4/5 <br /> <br />11. Brave New Girl -This is about as pop as it gets. Catchy, fun <br />and energetic. This one will definetly put you in a good mood. <br />It also has a bit of an electro pop sound to it too, like maybe something you'd heard in the 80's. The song is about finding confidence and facing the world. This one sounds fresh each time I heard it 4/5 <br /> <br />12. Everytime -Which leaves me to everytime....This is truly <br />Britneys best song. The songwriting is great, her vocals are good, the music box delicate sound to it fits the emotion of the song right on the dot. This song makes me so sad, but its really pretty I can't help but keep this one on repeat. No suprise this was a hit. 5/5 <br /> <br />13. Me Against The Music Remix - One of the best remixes I've heard since Mariah's Heartbreaker remix. Almost sounds better than the original Me Against The Music. Has a simaler banjo thing going on as \\"I Got That Boom Boom did\\" but don't let that scare you off!It doesn't sound bluegrass or anything..lol.quite the opposite. Very, fast paced and dancey: 5/5 <br /> <br /> <br />...and that's my deal on the songs. So, if you want some great music to just feel good too. Nothing overally depressing or serious (although Everytime is pretty emotional) Then I think you should pick up this cd. I listen to all types of music, and I like a lot of hard rock, alternative...electronic..many things...but every once in awhile, I need some music I can just get some peppy energy from and have fun ith. So if your into dance, clubby music, you should try this one out.  <br />
B0002VKZL6|1.0|If you like Bob Dylan, or Johnny Cash maybe even Willie Nelson then by all means pick up this album.   <br /> <br />For those people who like progessive Rock and Get chills from songs like Telegraph Road or maybe The Music for Montserrat and the full orch for Brothers in Arms you find the album uninpired and one dimentional.  I gave it my three listens and am going to see him Live in Chicago tonight.  I hope that the live show gives me a new impression of the album but I think not.   <br /> <br />Its not like I do not realize you need to listen to albums more than twice to get into them. Well the two copies I got with my concert tickets and the one I bought will all be up for sale soon. <br />
B000001ESJ|5.0|Rush continues their Newly Gained Greatness with their follow up too their smash hit \\"2112\\". Like I mentioned above the album has a midevil theme too it, with all but the final track Being based on times long ago. Lyrically the main idea of the album is that society should be less greedy and less hateful to each other and instead be (as Neil Peart puts it) Closer To The Heart. Sounds Kinda (...) right? Well if the lyrics bother you that much dont be discouraged, The Musical Greatness of Alex Lifeson, Geddy Lee and Neil Peart will blow you away. Heres What I Think of the songs.    1.A Farewell To Kings (4/5)- the intro verse is one of the greatest acoustic pieces Ive ever heard, it goes so well with the midevil theme of the album.  2.Xanadu (5/5)- Starts off as a high speed rocker than breaks off into a great mystical melody accompanied by an awesome melodic bassline.  3.Closer To The Heart (5/5)- Classic Song, has a great message to it  4.Cinderella Man (3/5)- A song about how in society people will be ridiculed just for being kind and selfless too others, An okay song  5.Madrigal (3/5)- too slow and soft, goes a little overboard with the whole midevil theme  6.Cygnus X-1 (4/5)- while the rest of the album deals with midevil stuff this one is about a spacemans struggle with a black whole in outer space, The song is bassically a 10 minute long jam session with some quirky lyrics thrown in, Great song    If you like Hard, progressive or softer rock music than check this album out.    If You Liked This album you might also like:  Uriah Heep- Demons And Wizards  Blue Oyster Cult- Spectres  Chilliwack- Dreams,Dreams,Dreams
141931176X|4.0|I just finished listening to the novel on CD read by Jenna Lamia.  Avoid it.  The reader tries to put on accents for every different character and fails horribly.  Her accent for Vermeer is most ridiculous of all and it takes away from the novel terribly.  The only well created accent is Griet's; that's not a compliment considering the many characters in this excellent novel.  Read the book but avoid this particular CD version.
B0002RNXNM|4.0|Let it be noted that I created my Amazon.com account after noticing there were so few reviews for this album. Please don't take me for a fanboy, however. <br /> <br />Anyways, on to the album. I am not a personal fan of the track Club Foot, due to overplay on the radio, but past that track it's all excellent. Once you get past L.S.F. you may hear a few hints of a \\"Hail to the Thief\\" Radiohead sound. That's not a bad thing, by any means.  <br /> <br />I will go on record as saying that if you like traditional british rock anthem cds (The Bends, Morning Glory, Park Life, Joshua Tree) more than a mildly electronic album (same bands as contrast: OK Computer/Hail, Think Tank, Achtung, Shoulder of Giants), you would probably prefer something more like Oasis' new record or Franz Ferdinand. The general sound is one of the club and post-club. Some tracks just beg you to dance - the front six mostly - while others just make you want to indulge in that after-party glow when your best buddies are over after clubbing chilling out before crashing at yours. <br /> <br />Alternatively, lying down in a dark room and putting this on as loud as your neighbours will allow can be an extremely gratifying experience. When you reach I.D. you will almost certainly feel a few chills as the soundscape shapes up - for a tension building minute or two - and then a smile flit accross your mouth as the beats kick in and don't let go until sometime in Running Battle when the guitars and synth sounds turn it up a notch (volume, that is). A very subdued, essentially *chilled out* seven or eight minutes of music. <br /> <br />I look forward to seeing this group live soon, as well as a subsequent album.  <br /> <br />Four >     Kasabian/Kasabian     &lt; four and a half stars.
B0007VRRU8|5.0|Above average sound quality. Good orchestra although less known (Polish). The filming itself very good , high quality colour camera work. Works best with high quality and large format tv &amp; above average quality loudspeakers.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I will make this short, these guys are very talented they have there craft down to a science. Those that said in the other reviews they have heard this all before. Yes, that is true but \\"Coldplay\\" are the only ones that can deliver that craft. I think this is the most solid album they have done. On here it sounded like they were totally aware of what the public expected of them. They touched on the best points of there previous two efforts. \\"Speed of sound\\" is obviously the masterpiece which reminds u of a combination of Clocks and Trouble combined. This album is extremley consistant and more consistant than the previous efforts. \\"A rush of blood\\" had some brillant tracks on it but alot of it was filler as well as the 1st. This cd all of the tracks could be a potiental single. I love the feel of this album alot more it is a long player. Classic piano riffs,string arrangments makes this album a more cohesive effort. <br /> <br />  For those that had any doubts about this band in the past. this is the one that will grab u ! <br /> <br />Arish
B00003CXZ4|5.0|I will try to keep this review brief. This is easily one of the most unique and interesting movies that I've seen in a long time. The writing, direction, and acting performances by everyone in this film are all top notch stuff.  <br /> <br />The basic premise of the film is a narrative as told from the perspective of the main character, Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) who is an insurance claims investigator. Due to a recent \\"incident\\" in which his wife is murdered, Leonard has lost the ability to retain any new memories. Older memories, however, are apparently left intact.  <br /> <br />Throughout the entire movie Leonard struggles to find his wife's killer from within his tragic new reality. He does this moment by moment, desperately keeping scribbled notes to himself which are hastily written on hordes of post-it notes and Polaroid pictures. These notes are pasted all over his sleazy hotel room and clues he deems very important are actually tatooed to any bare spot he can find on his body.  <br /> <br />There is a juicy twist, however. The entire story is told in reverse as a series of vignettes where Leonard recalls his past and interacts with the various seedy characters surrounding him. Each character has their own agenda, however, it isn't clear who Leonard can trust and who is playing him for their own ends. The other main characters are the crooked cop well played by Joe Pantolano, Carrie-Anne Moss as the scheming opportunist bartender Natalie, and a few local drug dealers and other miscreants. The coolest thing about this method of storytelling is that it really adds a desperate, almost schizophrenic tone to the viewing experience. This mirrors Leonard's own world and draws you into the character.    <br /> <br />If you like being spoon fed the summer blockbuster type fare, maybe you should rent this first. This movie will challenge you as you will be confused through most of your first viewing. But to anyone who enjoys a good Noir-style film or just offbeatstuff requiring a little thought, I heartily recommend this movie.
B0000084J7|5.0|A track from this just came up on my jukebox. When a track from this record, Spirit of Eden, or Laughing Stock comes up on the player, time just stands still. I guess this is the function of transcendent music. Really, Mark Hollis and Talk Talk changed music. They had far more influence on musicians than they did on the market. Being a musician, this is what I aspire to - not music that sounds like this, but music, any music, that can move and captivate like this...what a gift.
0446614459|4.0|I enjoyed the book. You know when I was younger there was a terrible aircraft accident in Tenerife. Two 747 Jumbo Jets took the active runway at the same time, colliding about 4000 feet later, one into the other. There were language problems, overworking conditions, stress and obviously visibility problems. But there was a split second when both aircraft took the active runway facing eachother that if any of 2 dozen situations could have occurred, been resolved, not happened . . . well you get the point.<br /><br />So Mr. Baldacci's \\"Split Second\\" is an interesting premise, one of the 25 or 26 basic plots authors have to work with. Inattention while guarding an important character, distraction, momentary 'drifting,' and lives are changed forever. Hell. In ancient Rome or Athens, the guards were asked to take their lives or were put to death. Big issue.<br /><br />I liked Joan Dillinger, Michelle Maxwell and Sean King. I didn't find them cardboard characters. There are those that write \\"See Spot Run\\" novels where the characters are one dimensional. Not so here. Were there Baldacci books I enjoyed more? Yes. \\"The Winner,\\" \\"Simple Truth\\" and \\"Faith\\" come to mind. But I fail to see how \\"Split Second\\" would let you down. 4 Stars. 4 1/2 if I had that opprotunity. Larry Scantlebury
B0009A1AS2|1.0|What happened to the prodigious band that I used to know with Scenes from a Memory, Six Degrees and Train of Thoughts? Have they lost all the creativity they had? <br />Octovarium is a huge deception. All the reasons why I loved Dream Theater are gone. Where's Portnoy? Has he lost an arm? And Petrucci? Chopped fingers? Why is LaBrie singing like Michael Bolton? Why is the music so kitch?<br />Booooooooo.
B00005JLT5|4.0|This movie stands out due to the excellent acting of the lead character and how well it manages to reflect on the lives of Jews(especially) and others caused harm by the war. Adrien Brody plays a role of a lifetime.The storyline and screenplay are quite solid.My favourite dialogue in the film would be where Wladek on his way to a camp tells his sister \\"I wish I knew you better\\" That summed up a lot for me.This film lasts for around 2 hours 20 minutes and had just about the right balance of timing and screenplay to notch up in itself a winner.<br /><br />Watch it!
B000060P79|2.0|Okay, don't just skip over this review yet. I'm not gonna go on about how much they suck, blah blah blah... <br /> <br />I'm not a \\"bubble gum punk\\" fan, at all. But I had heard a lot of hype about them, so I gave it a try. This cd like most, had it's high points and it's low points, I'd say more low than high. <br /> <br />High Points: <br />-I'd Do Anything- Good song, catchy, captures teen love very well. <br />-You Don't Mean Anything- Great  song, again it's catchy. It's all about teen agnst and you'll fall in love with it immediatly. <br /> <br />Low Points: <br />-I'm Just A Kid- Ok, first off, they're most definately not kids, so I have no idea what's going on the lyric part. And the music isn't that great, it sounds like most everything on the radio. <br />-God Must Hate Me- This gets old in the first 30 seconds. They have everything in the world, so why has god cursed them? Cuz they've taken a pathetic shot at punk. <br /> <br />It was a good cd to listen to the first time around, but it gets old really fast. Youll find yourself shoving it on your cd rack pretty quickly...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Excellent combination of well developed, interesting, likeable characters (all very well acted), action, humor (clever dialogue ), and science fiction.  Creative and logical projection of the challenges of exploration and settlement of real earth into futuristic galactic exploration and settlement.  Interesting portrayal of the merging of earth cultures, ethnicities and lanuages in the far future. Also interesting merger of past technology with futuristic technology. I also liked the nobility of character (of most) of the main actors - and enjoyed the one lacking in it.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Tim Burton hires Johnny Depp (gee, there's a first) to portray the slightly off-center chocolatier Willie Wonka in the recent version of 'Charlie And The Chocolate Factory'. <br />  <br />The only fair way to make any comparisons between this one and the original starring Gene Wilder is by their storylines. The new version gives a lot more detail from the book than the original did. The more noticeable main differences between the two stories are: 1) Mike Teevee and Violet Beauregard are made to look more violent in the new version, 2) You get to see what happened to the children as they're escorted out of the factory, 3) the geese that lay the golden eggs are replaced by squirrels that toss out bad nuts, and 4) you get to see the childhood of Willie Wonka in the newer version.  I would go into other story differences but I don't want to give too much away. <br /> <br />There wasn't a bad performance by any actor or actress in this movie, in my opinion. The one that deserves the most credit is Deep Roy who portrays every Oompa Loompa in the movie. Yes, I know, the computer special effects can easily make multiple copies of him; however, you can tell he went through a few dozen costume changes and alternate shots for the movie. AND, he does a better lip sync than Brittney Spears and Ashley Simpson combined.  I know.. that's not saying much. <br />  <br />The most interesting thing about the movie I didn't find out until the closing credits. The lyrics of the Oompa Loompa songs come straight from Roald Dahl's book.  <br />One of the few downsides of the movie was the sound quality of the first couple of songs. You couldn't quite tell what the lyrics were in the Loompa songs for Augustus and Violet. For the music portion, Tim once again hired the amazing talents of Oingo Boingo (not to be confused with Oompa Loompa) man Danny Elfman. It was kind of funny catching some people singing the Willie Wonka song as they were leaving the theater.  <br />The movie is rated PG and is great for the whole family to see.  <br />Movie warnings: bovine S&M (whipped cream room), robot cruelty, chocoholism, parent neglect, and karate kiddiness (I know.. not a word).  <br />Would I shell out $14+ to see it in IMAX (saw it for free on IMAX)? Hell no. I wouldn't pay that much for any movie. But, for matinee and regular movie prices, it's worth it.  <br />P.S. I didn't really see the connection that others did between Michael Jackson and the portrayal of Willie Wonka that Johnny Depp did.  The only common thing I saw was their skin complexion.  <br /> <br />
B0001NBMBC|5.0|The Guy Underneath Me Is Saying Slipknot Sucks Because There Not Christian Metal Like Zao If You Aint Got Nothin Good To Say Keep Your Mouth Shut
B00005JNSK|4.0|The 2005 version of the classic children's book is much closer to the original than most people (having grown up with Gene Wilder) might care to realize. Yet, this story about the mysterious candy maker does indulge in some liberties of its own.<br /><br />In addition to updated special effects, it attempted to explain why Willy Wonka ended up the way he did.<br /><br />Willy Wonka (Depp) was himself an unfortunate child at one point. He grew up with a sinister dentist father and never quite forgot the experience. Even when he became famous and rich, Wonka remembered where he came from. This gives him something to empathize with. The film honestly could have flown without this subplot being tucked in, but because it (again owning to Burton's direction more than anything) did not distract from the overall storyline, the inclusion is tolerable.<br /><br />The Wonka in this film is a gothic metrosexual type. Frankly when I looked at him, I first thought of Marilyn Manson or another shock rocker. While I usually only see remakes of classic films (regardless of how accurate the originals themselves really were) only because there is nothing else to do, the idea of seeing 'Marilyn Manson' give spoiled brats (who, yes, are especially mean in this film) their just deserts was something which I could not miss. Sure enough, it provided me with a tasty summer treat.<br /><br />Ed Wood did a marvelous job with this film, understanding Dahl's original work. Because Dahl's work was never meant to be 'family friendly' these two are the perfect combination for each other<br /><br />It's so easy these days for studios to attempt substituting flashy graphics and other special effects for any semblance of plot, but the special effect innovations in this film were used sparingly.  Even the computer-replicated oompa loompas looked remarkably real and were not just thrown in for the sake of it. Plus, they've got some new songs.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Before I heard this album I was a Nirvana-holic. Meaning that I hated anything that came out before '91, I thought \\"f**k Guns N' Roses and that hairmetal crap\\"! But then I heard 'Eruption', and I was like \\"How the hell does he do that\\"? I had to learn it, and I quickly realized what a true talent was. It wasn't playing four simple chords that even a beginner could do, it was about pushing the envelope and trying to sound great. Eddie Van Halen did just that. Although he didn't invent finger-tapping (that would be Fripp from King Crimson), he still had a great songwriting and speed talent.  <br />   But whay just praise Eddie? The whole band was great! Van Halen had the baddest frontman of the eighties. David Lee Roth was a unification of Roger Daltrey and Robert Plant, plus he was bad-ass. Alex Van Halen was a decent drummer, too. He could do both punk-style drumming and just regular classic rock style drumming. Michael Anthony provided a great rhythem section for the band, and he sounds especially good on the cover of The Kinks 'You Really Got Me'.  <br />   My favorite songs are 'Runnin' with the Devil', 'Eruption', 'You Really Got Me', 'Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love', and 'On Fire'. The whole band deserves great praise as they DID (along with AC\DC and Ozzy) kill disco. What a great band, I will never forget they turned me into a real guitar player.

B000002UAF|5.0|The year is 1964. Barely a year before, the Beatles burst onto the music scene, literally relegating everything else to the musical backbench. The boys were an extremely busy band; two albums in 1963 (Please Please Me, and With the Beatles - variously released in America under different names with different tracklistings), a barrelful of stand-alone singles that rank with their best work (i.e. She Loves You, I want to hold your hand - YES, these songs were never on any official albums) <br /> <br />A hard day's night was a 1964 offering, the first I believe of that year for the band. The album was devised as a soundtrack to the movie of the same name which I have seen, and heartily recommend as a great flick (albeit not too deep  - but it wasn't meant to be). There's something magical about just seeing the fab four doing anything! You get to see John Lennon in the bath.... (don't give me that look! I'm not insinuating anything here) <br /> <br />Anyway the first 7 songs were taken from the movie. Though the movie has a slightly different version of 'Tell me Why'. These are perhaps the stand out tracks of the 13 track album. Classic songs like 'A Hard Day's Night', 'Can't Buy Me Love', which everybody should know, are complemented well with the George-sung 'I'm Happy Just to Dance With You'. The upbeat 'I should have known better' is another great track; and 'Tell me Why' IMHO has such great energy to it that I can't understand why anybody wouldn't love it. <br /> <br />There are also moodier, slower songs, such as Paul's 'And I love her', and the excellent 'If I Fell'. They round off the first half of the album extremely well <br /> <br />THe second half is far from 'filler' songs, thrown in to fill out the tracklisting. There's no subpar songs here. Songs  like 'Anytime at all', 'Things we said today', 'You can't do that' etc, are wonderful songs that deserve recognition. The album is closed well by 'I'll be back', which is a more sombre song with a beautiful vocalmelody. <br /> <br />As I keep harping, buy every Beatles album. But buy this one as well! There's no way to fault it. And if you can, watch/buy the movie also!
B00000G3I2|1.0|I had heard so much about this movie over the years. Watched it finally and could not believe how bad it was. What a total waste of film and time. Was there even a script, or a production person that wasn't obviously stoned out of his/her mind, to this month old rotting hamburger helper movie, someone forget to bury?
B000002UAI|5.0|This album often brings out mixed sympathies in people. Some love it, others aren't so keen on it and cite the fact that it was 'rushed' as indicative of the large number of covers on this album. I'd agree that the boys were certainly overworked at this point in time; any of us can only imagine how hectic their lives must have been in 1964 when the whole world and everybody in it was absolutely enfatuated with them. <br /> <br />People tell stories of going to see Beatles movies at the cinema etc, just to scream at them. This seems like very peculiar behaviour to those of us that weren't around in 1964, but the Beatles were so original, innovative and groundbreaking that they were like a breath of fresh air after sombre, postwar 1950's when Britain and much of the world was licking its wounds. That may give you some idea of just why everybody loved them so much, but their music provides the BEST explanation <br /> <br />This album is of a good quality. It was undoubtedly rushed but that doesn't stop it from being excellent, just like the other Beatles work. I wouldn't rate Beatles for Sale as highly as some of their other work; albums like Rubber Soul, Revolver, even a Hard Day's Night are more well rounded albums. My theory is that the covers on Beatles for Sale keep the album from being consistent in the vein of those other LP's <br /> <br />Certainly, the Lennon/McCartney offerings on this album are of a high standard. Songs like 'I'm A Loser', 'Baby's IN Black', 'Every Little Thing' 'I don't want to spoil the party', are excellent. Similarly, 'No Reply', 'What you're doing' and 'I'll follow the sun' are well worth a listen. There's no drop in quality for these tracks from 'A Hard Day's Night' earlier in the year. It is really the covers that seem to prevent the album from being as great as the ones that preceded and followed it <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, songs like 'Rock and Roll Music', 'Mr Moonlight', 'Words of Love' are all good listening. They just don't stand up to the original brilliance of Beatles compositions. That being said, the album is 5 stars by any standard; the Beatles compositions are easily strong enough to survive a few average to good cover songs. <br /> <br />I wouldn't advise buying this album as your first Beatles album; buy Rubber Soul, Revolver, even a Hard Day's Night in preference. But by all means don't overlook BEatles for Sale in completing your collection.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is amazing. I am a big Sci-Fi fan (BSG, SG1, DS9) and this show blows them out of the water IMO. The characters, the dialog, the storylines, the action, the drama, the comedy (Yes, this show is funny). This show hits on ALL cyclinders. I just got introduced to the show a couple weeks ago when I saw the trailer for \\"Serenity\\".  Serenity is a movie that's based on the show and it comes out sometime in fall. I thought the trailer looked cool so I checked out the show. I was completely blown away!  I can't wait for the movie to come out and I can't wait to watch this DVD set again! <br />
B00008OLYN|5.0|I had given a verrry long break to listening to \\"death metal\\" -not the adequate word for defining Opeth actually- since I've listened \\"Individual Thought Patterns\\" when \\"Deliverence\\" introduced me to Opeth and I was quite surprised to find such a talented band which I'd not known.    After \\"Deliverence\\" I started listening to \\"Damnation\\" and you can imagine - it was a total shock. The bits and chunks of a calmer and softer Opeth which might be visible in the former albums is at your service full guns blazing.     I find it quite difficult to find the correct words to define this album and this music. This is not a boring accoustic album or a useless attempt to deviate from the normal self to be different. This is incredible music with beautiful harmonies and with incredible lyrics-straight from the heart-.     My favorites from the album are, \\"To Rid the Disease\\", \\"Windowpane\\" and of course \\"In My Time of Need\\".     Grab a bottle and start listening...Maybe you could find salvation from \\"Damnation\\".

1573223026|5.0|Four very different sets of shoes flank the cover of Nick Hornby's new novel, A LONG WAY DOWN. Brown wingtips, sloppily tied Vans canvas classics, sensible old lady shoes, and scuffed boots represent the characters whose accidental meeting on the roof of Topper's House in London begins the story. Why these four have decided to jump and how they muddle through carries the plot and, in Hornby's affectionate yet ironic hands, carries it very well. <br /> <br />The four take turns confiding in the reader via short narratives labeled with their names: Martin, Maureen, Jess, and the lone American JJ. Martin begins with typical British impatience. \\"Can I explain why I wanted to jump off the top of a tower block? Or course I can explain why I wanted to jump off the top of a tower block. I'm not a bloody idiot.\\" He is the fed-up-from-trying-to-make-his-way-back-after-a-prison-stint owner of those brown wingtips, creased at the toes but respectably polished. Next up is Maureen, who has earned the right to her sensible-old-lady shoes (and perhaps her death wish) by 20 years of caring for a son so disabled that he can't walk or talk or even understand the monologue his lonely mother persists in anyway. Jess is the spitfire in the sloppy Vans, the teenaged, profane, explosive daughter of an education minister and spurned lover of Chas, the immediate excuse for her climb to the roof of Topper's House. JJ arrives at this screwed up New Year's Eve party, pizza in hand, thinking about suicide because his band has broken up and his girl has left him; without music and his girl, what's the point? <br /> <br />Behind the venomous scorn Jess and Martin display toward each other, we feel their desperate need to belong. Having agreed to hang on until Valentine's Day, they become a kind of reluctant gang. \\"Rule 1: We don't kill ourselves for six weeks.\\" Here's Jess, when Martin demurs: \\"I hadn't felt like I was in this gang either, until that moment. And now I belonged to the gang that Martin didn't like much, and I felt real committed to it.\\" <br /> <br />The pace is snappy, sprinkled with splendid British slang: toffer, spliff, bloke, bleeding, eejit, geezer, snog, shag. It's hard to believe that a book about suicide can make you laugh. And wince. The characters may not be honest with others, but they are honest with us on the page, and their tentative, hard-won shifts in philosophy win us over. Wending their way through a shared vacation, an intervention in the basement of a Starbucks, a real suicide, and an almost-fistfight egged on by an intellectual homeless person, each character's predominant traits (Jess - outrageousness, Martin - self-serving and self-loathing, JJ - wistfulness, Maureen - wounded primness) worms their way into our hearts. By spring, all four have cobbled together their own reasons for going on, from the mundane to the profound. <br /> <br />Hornby clearly has his fingers on the pulse of several generations and social classes. Maureen delights her quiz team with the knowledge of the name of Mary Tyler Moore's boss, while Jess refers to \\"proper shoplifting: boosting Winona-style, bags and clothes and s---, not pens and sweets.\\" Perhaps most sad and touching is Jess's surprise that \\"Pop Idol\\" judges are fallible after all. Everyone steps back, reconsiders, changes. Says JJ, toward the end: \\"Busking isn't so bad. OK, it's bad, but it's not terrible. Well, OK, it's terrible, but it's not...I'll come back and finish that sentence with something both life-affirming and true another time.\\" <br /> <br />A LONG WAY DOWN is riveting, hilarious and very moving. Nick Hornby is at the top of his form. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Eileen Zimmerman Nicol

0312323859|4.0|Emily Giffin's first novel, SOMETHING BORROWED, focused on Rachel, a sweet but average-looking single lawyer who, on her thirtieth birthday, finds herself falling in love with Dex, the fianc of her best friend, Darcy. As Rachel and Dex carried on their affair under Darcy's nose, Giffin managed to gain readers' sympathy for her protagonist by showing Rachel and Dex's genuine love for each other and by painting Darcy as a first-class pain in the rear. Self-centered, shallow and shortsighted, Darcy is thoroughly unlikable, especially when readers discover that Darcy has been carrying on an affair of her own with one of Dex's groomsmen. <br /> <br />Because Darcy is such an unsympathetic character in SOMETHING BORROWED, Giffin's approach to the novel's sequel, SOMETHING BLUE, is pretty gutsy; instead of focusing on appealing underdog Rachel, Giffin's sophomore effort centers on Darcy, who is as selfish and unlovable as ever. The very first words of Darcy's narration --- \\"I was born beautiful\\" --- should give you a good sense of Darcy's narrative style and opinion of herself. <br /> <br />At the novel's opening, Darcy, pregnant following her pre-nuptial fling, must cope with calling off her picture-perfect wedding and breaking the news of her broken engagement and her less-than-perfect pregnancy to all her family and friends. Along the way she manages to annoy and alienate almost everyone, until she finds herself almost totally alone. Finally, she turns to her childhood friend Ethan, now living in London. Darcy has always dismissed Ethan before --- after he dared to turn her down back in fifth grade, she concluded he must be gay --- but now, he is the closest thing to a friend she has left. <br /> <br />Newly settled in London, Darcy continues her narcissistic, materialistic lifestyle without regard to her pregnancy, until she suffers a rude awakening and sets out a self-improvement plan that may not only benefit her unborn child but also finally enable Darcy to think about someone other than herself. Can Darcy get her act together and --- just maybe --- discover true love along the way? <br /> <br />It is a credit to Emily Giffin's writing skills that, with SOMETHING BLUE, she manages to fashion a novel whose central character is thoroughly unappealing (at least for the first 200 pages) but whose charming plot and witty writing style still make readers want to find out what happens next. Chances are, too, that by the time Darcy realizes the error of her ways, readers --- in spite of themselves --- also will be rooting for things to turn out well for the anti-heroine. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Norah Piehl

From the dramatic introduction of \\"Show me\\" to the kool, jazzy, bluesy finale \\"Mantrap\\" theme, it is a non stop listening fest. Very, very worthy of hitting the repeat button on your stereo system. <br />Martin Fry is definately blessed with the voice of an angel.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Put away that dusty copy of the 1971 film 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,' for Tim Burton's deliciously strange and outrageous film version of the famous novel is dare I say, better, a feast for the eyes and the ears. While some fans of the first film treatment will undoubtedly and stubbornly resist what Tim Burton has done here or trivialize Johnny Depp's weird and slightly maniacal performance, most others will be absolutely delighted. Burton's take is funnier, livelier, wittier, and all together more consistently entertaining than Mel Stuart's earlier film. The film is awash in color and bold and deleriously twisted set pieces. An enormous budget was spent creating this film and this fact is abundantly clear in every frame of the picture. However, the special effects and elaborate sets are always at the service of this fairy tale nightmare. Willy Wonka is given a history and motivation. Charlie is given more resonance and balance in relation to Willy Wonka and the other kids. The sinister and mischievous Oompas are funnier and are given some of the most over-the-top theatrical moments this side of Broadway. Overall, Burton's film version is truer to the spirit of the book and I do think the first film in Burton's career after his masterpiece 'Ed Wood,' that really stays true to the eccentric and amusingly bizarre character of Tim Burton himself. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is NOT just a kid's film. Parents and other adults who still have imagination will find much to enjoy and see with this one. Certainly, one of Burton's best films. Not to be missed!

B000000H5J|5.0|Think you know everything about Metal and Nu-Metal? Ever hear Fear Factory? If not, you've missed out on one of the most influential and innovative bands of the century! And if you haven't heard \\"Demanufacture,\\" you really need to educate yourself a little more...<br /><br />In a world where Grunge rained and Metal was nothing more than a thing of the past, Fear Factory rose up...a band of extreme skill...of extreme power...of extreme fury! 1995 saw the release of \\"Demanufacture\\" an album that mixed sounds of Techno and Electronica with heart-pounding, shredding Death Metal. Devoid of solos and elaborate guitar pieces, \\"Demanufacture\\" replaces complex riffs and structures with raw, unrefined energy and simplified structures that reflect Fear Factory's no nonsense, to-the-point attitude. \\"Demanufacture\\" suggests that Metal did not need to be complicated or full of whining guitar solos, but could rather be a pure expression of one's deepest anger, sadness and frustration.<br /><br />Burton C. Bell is undoubtedly a talented vocalist. He draws his inspiration from many contemporary Metal bands, but also from 80's bands and artists such as David Bowie and Gary Numan. The result is a singer capable of the most forlorn, sorrowful melodies but also of gut-busting, scorching anger and shouting. Raymond Herrera's drumming also hammers and pounds away at your ears, bordering on causing your brains to liquify and run out your eyes. His talent is one of the most powerful exponents in the legendary band. Dino Cazares is a guitarist of unparalleled skill and talent. His riffs sear through your mind and burn deep into your soul, his rhythms causing your body to atrify and your heart to arrest. Christian Olde Wolbers cannot be forgotten, and as a bassist with some serious sounds and anger, neither will you...<br /><br />Every single song on this album roars, cries, races and burns. No song really displaces or betters another and each has its own unique approach and message.<br /><br />An absolute classic album. Once you've heard Fear Factory, you will never be the same again. If you enjoy these guys, you'll also like \\"Static-X,\\" \\"Machine Head,\\" \\"Prong,\\" and \\"White Zombie.\\" Even if you're a classic metaller who takes a dump on Nu-Metal etc. etc. No Metal collection is truly complete without Fear Factory's \\"Demanufacture.\\"<br /> <br />An absolute classic album.

0385513755|5.0|Before starting reading this masterpiece, I read all the books of Dan Brown: Angels and Demons (Robert Langdon series #1), Deception Point, and Digital Fortress. The first book \\"Angels and Demons\\" will tell you the academic potential of the main character Robert Langdon. \\"Deception Point\\" puts its deception first and deceives you completely. Digital Fortress first kills the main character and pushes you to the bottom of the ultimate fear. This story starts small and goes deeper into the fathom of the eternal enigma in the world. It starts from a murder scene at the Louvre Museum. Langdon is soon marked as the prime suspect of this murder, and is pursued by the Paris police authority. During his escapade with a granddaughter of the murdered at the Louvre, the story evolves into the quest for the Holy Grail.<br /><br />To give the true authenticity in this book, a real best-seller book is referred in this book: \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail\\" by Michael Baigent, et al.<br /><br />Last year, I visited Westminster Abbey in London to retrace the steps of Langdon who tried to find the secret of Holy Grail. The real details of the location and the description of the tomb of Sir Isaac Newton was not the same with the book: the location was different and hard to find; the description made it impossible to hide behind the tomb. However, that fact would be exciting enough to know with this book in your hand, and the serene quietness of Westminster Abbey would undoubtedly add the time-freezing effect on your impression for the fast-moving thrill and suspense of this book. Two months ago, I also visited the Louvre Museum only to see the eternal smile of Mona Liza; it was impossible for a mere tourist to find the trace of the incident. Nevertheless, exact understanding of both the scenes would help you develop the sense of mystery and help you enjoy the book to your heart's content.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Don't let the UPN promos or the teen girl detective aspect of Veronica Mars fool you.  The premise might sound like typical teen fare, but the sharp writing, inspired casting, and a million other tiny details come together to make one perfect season of television.   <br /> <br />Veronica Mars, like Buffy Summers and Sydney Bristow before her, joins the ranks of strong female characters on television.  The difference is, Veronica is tackling the demons of life and she does it all without superpowers or spy gadgets. <br /> <br />In a nutshell, Veronica Mars used to have the perfect teen life.  When her best friend is murdered, she loses everything: her boyfriend, her social status, her mother, and the life she has always known.  With only her private detective father left to count on, Veronica picks herself up and does her best to move on, determined to find out who really killed her best friend.     <br /> <br />The show hits the ground running with an excellent pilot, and things just keep getting better from there.  Creator and executive producer Rob Thomas originally conceived Veronica Mars as a novel, so the characters and the mystery develop at a very natural pace from episode to episode.  The cast is incredible and full of young up and comers, from Kristen Bell (who carries the show on her tiny but capable shoulders) to the amazing Jason Dohring.  Desperate Housewives and Lost got all the attention this television season, but it was Veronica Mars that got better with every episode and delivered a compelling answer to every question it raised.

The soundtrack is worth getting, and is in my opinion one of the best from Hisaishi (Probably matched only by the Princess Monoke OST or the Spirited Away OST).

When men understand why women act the way they do and why they expect certain things from men, they can more readily accept them for who they are and give reason to sometimes unreasonable seeming requests (and the same is true for women).<br /><br />While most of the points in this book are fairly evident, there are a lot of insights that most people don't really think about that have big impacts on relationships.  I find it somewhat refreshing to read a sometimes brutally honest books about the biological differences between men and women in this age when all the emphasis goes to strong independent women who are equal in every way to men.  In fact, there are major differences in our very cores that influence the way we view others, feel emotionally, think about the world, and even our wants and needs.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anybody, male or female, who wants to understand what is going on in your partners head and wants to build a more trusting and understanding relationship.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" plays like fine wine: it gets better with age.  For most listeners, it's not going to overwhelm at first impression, such as U2's \\"The Joshua Tree,\\" or Led Zeppelin IV.  But one can recognize the brilliance through repeated listenings.    While I think the first two songs (\\"Politik\\" and \\"In My Place\\") are decent, the album really gets going with \\"God Put a Smile on My Face,\\" especially where that signature Coldplay \\"wall of sound\\" kicks in with the verse \\"Yeah, where you work it out I'm worse than you.\\"  For the first time, the band demonstrates some upbeat pacing, to great effect.    Does anyone remember at the end of the 2004 Yankees-Red Sox playoff series (you may recall that the Yankees won the first three games and the Red Sox the next 4) where the producers clipped together a short highlight film and played \\"The Scientist?\\"  It was as if Chris Martin wrote the song for that moment when he sang \\"nobody said it was easy, it's such a shame for us to part, nobody said it was easy, no one ever said that it would be so hard, take me back to the start.\\"  It was a perfect match of image and sound.    When I first heard \\"Clocks\\" on the radio, I though it was a new U2 song with a really cool piano riff.  As many reviewers have noted, Coldplay has clearly been influenced by U2 and Radiohead, but what's wrong with that?  Hasn't U2 been influenced by The Who, and Radiohead by Robert Fripp and Brian Eno? In any event, \\"Clocks\\" gave the band a great memorable hit, which never seems to grow tired.    It's interesting that a number of reviewers aren't crazy about \\"Daylight,\\" because it's my favorite track on the album.  I especially find the chorus mesmerizing (\\"Ooh and the sun will shine, yeah on this heart of mine\\").  \\"Green Eyes\\" is a touching love song, whereas \\"Warning Sign\\" should not be played by anyone who has just gone through a painful breakup.  Both are wonderful slow songs, but are not to be outdone by the hypnotic, mantra-like \\"A Whisper.\\"  Although, I'm not crazy about the title track, the album ends with the poignant \\"Amsterdam,\\" where Martin sings in a shaky unsure voice about something that's obviously deeply personal (\\"Stood on the edge, tied to a noose, you came along and cut me loose\\").    I love \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head.\\"  What's almost scary is that, in my opinion, Coldplay's next offering, \\"X&Y,\\" may be even better (though perhaps not as consistent).
B00005JMAH|3.0|I probably will never appreciate the Harry Potter movies as much as I do the books.  There is just something, I think, that seperates the two mediums of art to the point where one will always be not quite to the level of the other, and usually it is the movie that dissapoints fans of the book.  While the opening of this new adventure was promising, the story rapidly falls away into a series of scenes which seemed disconnected in some ways, finally coming together again for the excelent conclusion.<br /><br />I have enjoyed watching the movies so far, don't get me wrong, they aren't at all bad, it just seemed more disjointed then the past two entries.  The entire middle section consists mostly of Harry and the gang going from class to class, with maybe a revelation here, or the aquisition of some important artifact there, without a lot of attempts at tying things together.  The first half hour and last half hour were, to me, the only parts of the movie worth watching.<br /><br />Maybe to someone who hasn't read the books, the enchantment of this movie will sweep them away, but to a loyal fan of the Rowling's writing, I can say that I would much rather pull out the book and read for a few hours than pull out the movie and watch for two.
B000068IEU|5.0|What people may miss about this nearly flawless film is its horrific and sickening feeling we viewers are standing in the shadows watching these unthinkable and sickening events unfold.  And what people may consider a \\"low-budget\\" or \\"b-movie\\" or \\"debut film of...\\"  film, perhaps they've forgotten that this isn't a retelling of some supernatural rumor; this is reality in its most desperate and \\"of-the-times\\" measures.  <br />Watch it once, maybe you feel a bit let-down or disappointed? Trust me, keep it around, because eventually this film is going to get inside you and make you feel.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Im very very angry! The critics are fools who sit in their ivory towers rating things for us, making decisions which we are quite able to make on our own, i bought this cd as they told me it was awful, it was in fact the best album produced in 2003! If it were paul Mcartney or sting who had produced an album with such depth and discussion would the media be trashing them? I think not, Madonna has done something with this album which she has been doing for over twenty years now, speaking her mind! It is for this reason alone that i applaud the woman. As for the album it is a fascinating listen because at last we get a glimpse of what the lady herself is actually thinking and what makes her tick. Perhaps this is all too much for the press, they cant handle the real Madonna the fact that she hasnt been happy with her selfish past or obsession with material growth (Mariah and J-Lo please take note)the lady has matured! I pray that Madonna stays around for another twenty years we need her! We need an artist to keep on pushing the envelope and treading against the grain, who gives a damn if AL only sold 10million world wide, its the quality not quantity that counts and AL has quality in abundance. Respect.
B00025ETIW|5.0|By far, the best thing I have ever done is buy this album and get into MCR.  I really don't care that they've gone mainstream, and neither should you- now everyone can buy and appreciate this album for what it is- the best piece of rock music that I've heard in a long time.  There is no song on this album that I dislike or skip- though there are some instant classics such as Thank you for the venom (my personal favorite) I'm Not Okay (of course), The Ghost of you, and Helena.  You know what they do to guys like us in prison is pretty funny, especially the part about missing his mom...I never told you what I do for a living is a great song to end the CD with...Cemetary Drive could possibly be the best song on the album, though they are all worth listening to over and over again.  The bottom line is that these songs make you think- they make you feel- Buy this album and you'll start planning revenge the moment Helena gets up to do her ballet dance.
B0007GAERG|2.0|Im sorry guys but Emancipation of Mimi is quite literally the same old stuff from the same old Mariah, nothing has changed!Im from the UK where in sales terms Mariah laggs immensley behind the likes of Madonna, Whitney and even Britney Spears. Her only number one single to date has been Without You (cover version) which was to be quite frank, dreadful. I cannot believe she holds the title for biggest selling female artist, who's been counting? The rest of Europe has proved just as elusive for Mariah with only handfuls of hits throughout each territory in Europe nothing on as broader scale say as Madonna who has had at least 10#1's in 7 of our EU member countries (14 in France). As for Mimi we belong together is a nice ballad but i just cannot get into the rest. I guess you Americans must really love her, 150million albums worth alledgedly! Sure her older hits were real catchy numbers, dream lover, fantasy, someday but times have changed and Mariah needs to do so to. She should strike out in a different direction for a change, come to Europe maybe and work with some different producers from a different sound. It never did Madonna's, Britney or Whitney's careers any harm.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Despite what future releases are in store for us in the remainder of 2005, I think its safe to say this awesome record will be one of the year's prime cuts. \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" is currently receiving heavy rotation on MTV and is without a doubt a great hook to reel in potential buyers, although after the massive sales of the Gorillaz self titled debut, I doubt they'll have to worry about faltering numbers. This record is without a doubt the best modern pop album I've heard in years. Every song is laden with catchy hooks and throbbing beats that are sure to cement themselves in listeners heads. However, I have to say \\"Feel Good Inc.\\" does boast the best bass riffing on the entire album but that isnt to say the rest of the record pales in comparison. \\"Kids with Guns\\" and \\"O Green World\\" pack a nasty one-two punch and its a great lead in for \\"Dirty Harry\\" a \\"sequel\\" of sorts to \\"Clint Eastwood\\" off of their first record. \\"Every Planet We Reach is Dead\\" and \\"White Light\\" are also first rate  but the crowning king is \\"Dare\\". A sure fire four on the floor dance fest, but the festivities don't end there, dont miss Denis Hopper's interesting narrative on \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\". Anyways Demon Days is simply a audio treat and how can you not adore those cool cartoons! <br /> <br />By the way, be sure to check out the Gorillaz official website, one of the coolest sites ever!
0975991477|2.0|I am still laughing at the last reviewer (I. M. Light) saying that \\"psychiatrics\\" have proven that reality is all \\"in the head.\\"  Well, I don't know about these \\"pyschiatrics\\" but as for psychiatrists, I doubt they would really argue that reality is contained in the mental universe of the mind.  The notion that we can externally affect reality on any global or marked degree is a rather naive, good-feel notion.   <br /> <br />It is interesting to note that some highly reputable scientists are now showing some absolutely incredible effects that consciousness has on reality, including affecting cellular function and being able to remotely access information that physcially the observer is removed from in either time or space.  It genuinely seems these are very real facets of our reality, but the asertion that the mind can then cure diseases is not merely naive but potentially dangerous in perhaps inspiring those that are afraid of medicine and doctors to seek curing themselves in some Zen-like meditative wishfull thinking instead of seeking and following sound, proven medical practices. <br /> <br />As someone that has read this book, I do not find any real compelling evidence let alone proof for the case to me made that any \\"mind over matter\\" affect in the context of curing disease exists.  The author has not established this claim or proven it to be the case.  It might very well be in some cases, and I am open to that possibility, but he has not made that case.  The case studies he sites and supposed \\"scientific reaserch\\" is sketchy, vague, and often at times highly questionably in terms of methodology and conclusion. <br /> <br />I give this book only two stars because it is interesting in concept but not deserving of any higher rating due to its lack of rigor and not proving what amounts to be a scientifically testable claim.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|I remember watching \\"Bullitt\\" in an old Cherville theater, choked with the stench of marijuana smoke and stale beer. As a child, the visual and psychotropic experience was so overwhelming that I left the theater numb. Years later, I bought and restored a Mustang GT 360. I wore black wool turtlenecks wherever I went. I encouraged the growth of warts on my face. I grunted when spoken to, and left public phones dangling by their cords while I hurried away. I was even married to Jacqueline Bissett for seventeen days, although the police told me later that the ceremony was nonbinding. <br /> <br />I'm better now, and this 2-DVD set certainly brings back a warm, buzzy nostalgia. The cast is stellar, with Robert Vaughn recapping his Napoleon Solo role as the Evil Politician of Frisco, and Simon Oakland as The Captain, blustering and strutting as only Oakland can do. <br /> <br />And, of course, Steve McQueen, whose essence of coolness just can't be contained or explained (Use slow motion during the vehicle chase: When McQueen overshoots a turn up the hill, you can actually see him take out a pack of Winston's, place a cigarette in his teeth, and light it with a match -- all within 1.3 seconds, and without taking both hands off the wheel. Amazing!). <br /> <br />I certainly hope everyone buys a copy of this movie.
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|I absolutely adored Toxicity. It had songs, these tracks sound like scraps left on the floor. None of these songs rank anywhere near their last album. I miss Serj's singing, I CANT STAND Darons 'little girl being tortured' sucky vocals.  Once in a while in the background is OK, but his head has apparently swollen so big over sucess that it has cut off circulation to his brain and now he thinks his vocals are just as good as Serj. PLEASE! This CD has a moment or two, but Toxicity felt like songs/epics and these short bursts sound thrown together. The last two songs both have Hollywood in the title and the lyrics, boy that is some imagination. That figures because I read where Daron decided on the track sequence. Oh well, I'll still be curious about the next cd, but I don't have much hope, except that Serj's vocals are featured more, and Daron shuts the hell up!
1402555989|5.0|We took this book in audio format on a summer vacation road trip. Not only did it keep mom the driver awake, but the preteen/teenage kids and dad also loved the story. We still make reference to some of the lines from the book a month afterwards. Definitely a great book, and one that is appropriate for mixed ages (due to censorship/parental tyranny we had to can our other audiobook, Dress Your Family in Denim and Corduroy).
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie was so hilarious. Anyone who hated it or didn't like it because they thought it was \\"stupid' is stupid. It wasn't meant to be serious. It was meant to be a funny movie that let people have fun. Header is hilarious in his debut film. His now famous lines like \\"Gosh\\" and \\"Idiot\\" were so funny. I also liked the little hint of romance that it carried with Deb and Napolean. They are friends in this movie but they have really good chemistry. The only crticism that I have is that i was hard to really explain the movie, becasue it didn't really have a point to it. When someone asked me to explain it, I was at a sudden lost for words. I would have said it was about a boy trying to help his friend become class president, I could have said that it was about 2 nerds and their sexist idotic uncle, or I could have said that it was about being an outcast and wanting secretly wanting to be somebody better. But otherwise it was great, and I give if 5 stars!
B00004RHZU|5.0|I just needed to write a review for this album because I read the editorial review and I couldn't disagree more. I first saw Pink opening for N*Sync in 2000 and had no idea who she was, and I was completely blown away by her performance. I went out and bought her album right after the show. I fell in love with \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" that night and by the next day I had all of the lyrics memorized. Her voice is incredible, and no matter what you think of the lyrics/quality of the songs, I don't see how you couldn't be knocked out by the vocals. She sounds like no one else. I think her debut album is quite unique; like nothing I had ever heard before. The lyrics are offbeat and definitely not your typical love songs, or your average \\"my man's done me so wrong\\" songs for that matter. \\"Stop Falling\\", in particular, is absolutely beautiful lyrically. I think Pink has been a step ahead since the beginning, and if you like the music she's making these days, I definitely think you should check out this album and see how it started, especially if you love her voice.
B00003CWN3|5.0|\\"Boys Don't Cry\\" was a sad and disgusting story, about a young girl name Teena Bredan, who is facing a sexual identity crisis. Although she doesn't want to admit it to herself, she is a lesbian, and she is a girl. The whole movie was a brilliant renactiment of the true story.    Teena Bredan is a girl, who wants to be a man. She is having trouble figuring out who she is and is having a sexual identity crsis. She goes to a bar one night and meets Candance, played by the girl who played Becky in Rossane for the first seasons (I don't know her name), who befriends her/him and brings him to her home. Brandon becomes friends with everyone instantly, he doesn't tell anyone that he is really a girl. After weeks of getting to know these people and living with them,he develops a relationship with Lana, played by Chloe Sevigny, who was also brillant in this film. Lana soon finds out that Brandon is not a full man when they start to become sexually active. She pauses for a moment, but realizes that she loves Brandon, no matter what. This is when things start to go wrong. John, Lana's ex boyfriend, and his friend, soon find out about Brandon. They are white trash who have never been outside of anything and don't follow the law. They end up brutally raping Brandon and then shooting Candance and Brandon in the end. The two people that Lana truly cared about in life.    This story was one of the most disgusting that I've heard . As I was watching, I thought to myself, how could someone be so cruel to another person, how could someone be so crazy? How could you ruin to love? Who in the wrold is really that close minded. This was a true tale of pain, love, suffering, confusion, wanting to live a good life, and trying to find yourself.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I just love this movie. There's hardly a better one on this planet, 'cause it's absolutely brilliant. The whole film's very good, though not as good as the book, but that's okay. Well, like I already said: a masterpiece, one of the best movies EVER.
B000002U82|5.0|PINK FLOYD: Syd Barrett (guitar, vocals; born January 6, 1946), David Gilmour (guitar, vocals; born March 6, 1944), Nick Mason (drums; born January 27, 1945), Roger Waters (bass, synthesizer, vocals; born September 9, 1944), Rick Wright (keyboards, synthesizers; born July 28, 1945). <br /> <br />Pink Floyd is simply, the Space Rock trademark ever. Each song of this album it's a kind of paranoia and pleasure auditive, mixed in a way that when I listen it my brain is adicted more and more... Since these days I was fan of this not-convencional Rock band. The atmospherical and space tunes, added with a lunatic lyrics and against feelings, make you don't find the beggining and end of each song, all they are in fact, the end and begginig of each one. The same way like Led Zeppelin, I have all album of this other GREATEST BAND. <br />   <br />Pink Floyd quickly began to experiment, however, stretching out songs with wild instrumental freak-out passages incorporating feedback; electronic screeches; and unusual, eerie sounds created by loud amplification, reverb, and such tricks as sliding ball bearings up and down guitar strings. <br /> <br />Their 1973 release Dark Side of the Moon hit Number One on the Billboard charts and ultimately broke all records by remaining on the Top 200 album charts for 741 weeks. Dark Side of the Moon did not drop off Billboard's Top 200 album chart until 1988, and sell more than 15 million copies in the US alone. The album signaled rock's willingness to move from adolescence into adulthood, conceptually addressing such subjects as aging, madness, money and time. From its prismatic cover artwork to the music therein, Dark Side of the Moon is a classic-rock milestone. The subject of alienation was further explored in Wish You Were Here (1975), an album whose central preoccupation was the band members' distance from each other (\\"Wish You Were Here\\") and erstwhile leader Syd Barrett's distance from reality (\\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\"). They turned their gaze outward yet again on the Orwellian Animals (1977), whose songs bore the titles \\"Pigs,\\" \\"Sheep\\" and \\"Dogs.\\" <br /> <br />January 16, 1996.Pink Floyd is inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame at the eleventh annual induction dinner. Billy Corgan of Smashing Pumpkins is their presenter. <br /> <br />If you are a lover of the music, you should to have it in your collection, weathever taste you had.

B000002UTO|4.0|Welcome to the most overlooked Duran Duran Album (it's even ignored in the band's future hits compilations). Like \\"Notorious\\" it's a transition album. However, it's more solid than \\"Notorious\\". It certainly follows what was hip at the time (U2 and INXS) so it's a bit dated. However, it's a perfect preview of \\"The Wedding Album\\" which was the band comeback and the record that pull them out of being just and 80s band. It's one of the most underrated CDs of 1989, as well as their 2004 \\"Astronaut\\" was the second most underrated CD of that year (behind Blondie's \\"The Curse of Blondie\\").
B0007Y08QA|3.0|An insomniac who imagines another person... hmm, sound familiar?  This film is a over-simplified rip off of Fight Club.  The pacing is a bit too slow, the mood is unbearably constant, and the dialogue is rarely interesting.
0802136834|5.0|I love English history, especially the period from King Edward IV's reign through the Tudor's. Henry VIII was one of the most powerful monarchs in British history, who ruled England in unprecedented splendor. He has long been one of my favorite historical characters, as have three of his six wives, Katherine of Aragon, Anne Boleyn and Katherine Parr. For better and for worse, he was certainly a larger than life figure. (quite literally so - at his death, he was obese). I know of very few fictional personages who are as complex and fascinating as this man, (and the women who attracted him). Born to Elizabeth of York and King Henry VII on June 28, 1491 in Greenwich Palace. Henry was a second son and not expected to rule. But rule he did. He became heir to the throne on the death of his elder brother, Prince Arthur, in 1502, and succeeded in 1509. Sir Thomas More once said of him, \\"If a lion knew his strength, it were hard for any man to hold him.\\"<br /><br />Henry was highly intelligent, and, as a youth, quite athletic. Described by a contemporary: \\"He speaks good French, Latin and Spanish; is very religious; heard three masses daily when he hunted ... He is extremely fond of hunting, and never takes that diversion without tiring eight or ten horses ... He is also fond of tennis.\\" He wrote books and composed music, and was a lavish patron of the arts. As the author of a best-selling book, which went through 20 editions in England and Europe, attacking Martin Luther and supporting the Roman Catholic Church, Henry was given the title \\"Defender of the Faith\\" in 1521 by the Pope.<br /><br />\\"The second half of Henry's reign was dominated by two major issues, very important for the future of England and the monarchy: the succession and the Protestant Reformation, which led to the formation of the Church of England.\\" Women and the role they played in the King's life, impacted many of his policies and actions - but the Protestant Reformation and the succession, in particular, had their roots in Henry's relationships with women. He was perhaps England's most infamous monarch, especially when it came to matters of lust, love, marriage, and the unusually cruel and ruthless ways he invented to terminate soured relationships. He was married to six distinctly different women. Author Alison Weir chronicles Henry VIII's metamorphosis from vibrant young prince to despotic, paranoid old king through his marital history, in this richly detailed and meticulously researched composite biography. She has used many public records, diaries, diplomatic sources, and personal letters of the early 1500's to offer a comprehensive, factual version of the private and public lives of Henry VIII and his wives.<br /><br />Ms. Weir writes, with great elegance, wit and insight, about each of the women, and how their lives impacted their times and history. She also describes each of these complex women, their unique characters as individuals, (not just as consorts to a king), their motivations and ambitions. She outlines their ascent and decline, and how they related to one another, their peers and families...and to their husband.<br /><br />Catherine of Aragon dominates the first part of the book, but that is to be expected. She was married to Henry for 24 years, and prior to their marriage, she was wed to his older brother Arthur, a cause for future problems for the realm and much heartbreak for Catherine. Queen Catherine is portrayed most sympathetically, and that is my inclination also. She was a noble lady, raised to serve as Queen, who loved her husband, almost as much as she loved God and the Catholic Church. I have always wondered how Henry's character, his country and history would have changed if Catherine had born him a healthy son. One of the most poignant sentences in history, is one of Catherine's last. As she lay dying, she dictated a letter to the husband who had so ruthlessly abandoned her. She bid her scribe to write: \\"Lastly, I make this vow, that mine eyes desire you above all things. Farewell.\\"<br /><br />Anne Boleyn was an extremely well-educated, and very independent young woman, especially given the times. And Henry was obsessed with the idea of possessing her. Anne played his obsession to the hilt. Her complex and ambitious nature, as well as the politics of her downfall, are portrayed with great skill by Ms. Weir. Anne never bore Henry his longed for son, but she was the mother of Queen Elizabeth I, a truly great monarch.<br /><br />Poor Jane Seymour's mild manner was a temporary, but welcome, relief to Henry after his relationship with and marriage to Anne. However Queen Jane's narrative is brief, as was her life. She died after birthing Henry's only living son. Henry once said that he loved Jane Seymour best of all his wives, (she never really argued with him or expressed differing points of view), and he was buried by her side.<br /><br />Anne of Cleves, perhaps the most politically astute of Henry's wives, certainly the one with the best survival skills, was thrilled to be cast-off and allowed to keep her head.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the naive and beautiful Katherine Howard, Henry's \\"blushing rose without a thorn\\" went the way of Anne Boleyn, because of promiscuity, lack of savvy, and church politics.<br /><br />And Catherine Parr, a woman of extraordinary intellect, was one of only eight women whose writings were published during the reign of Henry and his father. She was fortunate to become aware of a plot against her before she met the same end as Queens Anne and Katherine.<br /><br />As a backdrop to these personal dramas and matters of state, the author draws a lavish portrait of court life with its moral and political intrigues. She details the struggle for international power, and clearly explains England's break with Rome and the beginning of the Protestant Reformation.<br /><br />This is a superb and very readable history, that has been meticulously researched. I have read three histories of King Henry VIII, his reign and his wives, and this is by far the best. I highly recommend it.<br />JANAe all things.

B000000LZV|5.0|Simply the best Minutemen album in terms of length and scope.  It's experimental, brazen and contains some of the best music the boys from San Pedro ever wrote.  Along with Zen Arcade by Husker Du it's the greatest American punk rock double album of the eighties from one of America's most unique trios.  In fact it may be a little better than Zen Arcade and that's saying something.  This was made before punk was lockstep conformity with pop girlfriend/boyfriend themes. Double Nickels is political, poetic, heartfelt and deserves to be called a masterpiece.  If you can own only one album by the Minutemen this is the one to get.
B00008VGL6|1.0|For a man who can write so brilliantly and has one of the best voices I have ever heard, I have never been more disappointed.  First of all, he is a brilliant writer and did not write any of these songs.  I was very disappointed and sold my copy before I even listened all the way through.  I like the Counterfeit ep he release in 89....this was just too bad!  I expected so much more and got a load of garbage.  Thank God for David Gahan!  Maybe Martin needed to get back with Depeche so we can forgive him for this!
B0007Y4USW|3.0|I am, and have always been, a HUGE Mariah Carey fan. I grew up on her music. The Emancipation of Mimi is her best CD in years, however, it is NOT her best CD ever. I like some of the songs - We Belong Together, Stay the Night (catchy beat), Fly Away, Circles, etc., but I'm dying for the old Mariah! I'm glad that she seems to have matured a bit, (she's acting a little more her age), but she's still trying too hard to appeal to the teeny-boppers who buy music. I love rap & hip-hop and was once a \\"rap only\\" listener in my teenage years. However, sometimes artists need to take a leap of faith and produce quality music, not just music to sell in stores. <br /> <br />As for her voice, I like it on this album because it sometimes takes me back to her voice in the beginning. However, I agree with other reviewers that she's trying too hard and her voice most times sounds strained in one breath and whispery (to the point of annoyance) in the next. <br /> <br />Mariah, please stop try to mass market your music. Please bring back some of the quality vocals and lyrics that made you a success.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I wish I could give it that, but yeah it's Star Wars, who wouldn't like Star Wars. My bro wanted to want for the boxed set of all 6 (much cheaper he claims). I went ahead and bought this one and I'm glad I did. Music is a plus as always, I loved the new scenes+4 disc, and most of all, the movies themselves. You dumb reviewers that give this one a 3 down to 1 you are so intent on the +ed scenes you forgot all about the movies. I love skiping to the battle scenes, the  first time the force theme is played, and the CANTINA BAND!!! ROCK ON!!! That is all I have to say about this.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|This is the best work ever done by MK in his career. I've been listening MK since very young and he is the best guitar musician of all times to me. It took me some time to discover the essence of every song and the concept of this amazing album. <br /> <br />The best song for me is \\"Everybody Pays\\". By its music and great lyric, it reached to me very deep. Other hits to me are \\"5.15 A.M.\\", \\"The Trawlerman's Song\\", \\"Back to Tupelo\\" and \\"Our Shangri-La\\" of course, but every song is a masterpiece of music and have its own sense. <br /> <br />This is a \\"must have\\" album for everybody who likes music, but you've got to give it some time to hear...
B0001MDQ2G|1.0|I found out about these guys from a sampler CD that came with rotting christ (who actually is a good band) and the one song on the sampler was good but when I bought the C.D. the rest of the songs were garbage, the guys vocals on most of the songs make him sound like he should be singing along side justin timberlake, but it's worse because it is advertised like heavy metal, don't buy this if your into heavy metal
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne is really a wonderful singer! I got to see her afew months ago, she has a great voice and her songs rock. She writes her own songs which showcase her talent, so many artists today can't even play an instrument. She can, and she does, and she does it well. Losing Grip, and Nobody's Home by Avril Lavigne, Behind These Hazel Eyes by Clarkson, Down Home by Corinna Fugate, and of course, Shadow, by Ashlee Simpson. Fans of Ashlee Simpson, Michelle Branch, and Corinna Fugate will love Avril Lavigne's heartfelt release, Under My Skin. They write from their souls, and you can feel it. <br /> <br />
B000001ELB|5.0|I'll make it short and simple. If you only can afford one KISS cd, this is the one you should get. These are the classic songs that made KISS and gave them their identity. There's a lot of music here; originally released on vinyl (I've got that too) these tracks filled two records. <br /> <br />KISS had many more hits after the release of this compilation, but if I were on a desert island and could only bring one KISS cd, this would be it. I'd miss some of the later stuff a lot, but I'd survive happily with Double Platinum. You will too.
B00005UKKF|4.0|This DVD is pretty sweet. I am not afraid to admit how sexy and awesome Britney Spears is. She has accomplished so much considering the over 50 million albums she has sold in 6 years! Okay, maybe she does not have the best voice but her music is pretty tight and always tops the charts. She throws the most entertaining concerts, especially this one in Las Vegas. I haveto admit that she does lipsync on some songs but HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO HER BAD ASS DANCES! But she does sing her song on the piano and the more mellow ones. This is an awesome show along with all of her other ones such as Britney Live and More and Time out with Britney. If you love her music videos, be sure to get her Greatest Hits DVD and CD.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Ok, so for the first time in a very long time I think the boys in DT have put together a solid front to back COMPOSITIONAL album - no endless masterbatory wanking, no awkward lyrical moments, no moments where you hear one or two guys totally take over the project to the detriment of the others. On this CD everyone gets their time in the sun and at stage front in the spotlight, and this is an excellent thing!!<br /><br />Ok so that doesn't mean there aren't any uneven moments - track 2 in my opinion is a throw away track that would belong on Jordan's or James' solo CDs and not necessarily on a DT disk. But looking at the rest of the project you need to understand that this is supposed to be not only a retrospective CD covering all their past and all their influences both individually and as a band, which means they need to bring in the sappy ballad that makes 13 year old girls swoon and want to light the Bics up... the rest of the CD makes up for that one misstep. Track 4 isn't my favorite either, but it's fairly solid and would probably be considered one of the best tracks on any other band's CD - reiterate BEST TRACKS ON ANY OTHER BAND'S CD. We forget that sometimes, since we expect such high quality from these guys that when they try to get something accessable in to have as leverage for renegotiating their recording contract we get all pissed off and slag them for it. Shame on you, these guys deserve to be making HUGE MONEY so shut up and just enjoy the rest of the stuff that was written for YOU the DT fan!<br /><br />Why did I give the CD 5 stars? Tracks 1, 3, 5 thru 8 are brilliant! That accounts for 65 minutes of the total 75 on the CD - what other band out there gives you 65 minutes of even solid music much less brilliance?!?! Even the bands that DT quotes in this CD haven't put out a solid 45 or 50 minute CD ever in their history!!! You need to put things into perspective people!<br /><br />There are a ton of \\"homages\\" in here to all the rock, prog rock and metal heroes - Rush, Muse, U2, Yes, Genesis, Ayreon, Pantera, Steve Morse, Steve Howe, Spock's Beard, Zappa and more! Anyone who thinks that this is lame needs to get back off the crack and listen closely. Listen a lot more than just the first time since I guarantee that you need to listen to this thing at least 10-15 times before you \\"get it\\"...<br /><br />I think from a compositional standpoint this sits up there with Awake and Scenes From a Memory - very very solid with wonderful instrumental arrangements, James LaBrie's best vocal performance ever on a DT recording, great lyrics... it goes on and on.<br /><br />As a final word - this is DT's \\"Moving Pictures\\". This is the pivotal CD that will bring DT the type of attention Moving Pictures did for Rush, Fragile did for Yes, Selling England for Genesis, etc. Just wait - this is a landmark album for these guys.k and metal heroes - Rush, Muse, U2, Yes, Genesis, Ayreon, Pantera, Steve Morse, Steve Howe, Spock's Beard, Zappa and more!

B000000OQF|5.0|TOO HOT to last, Now these boy would blow your brains out with all them Damn Marshell Amps . Slash would play that Les Paul, well some people would say when he played it, It sounded like it was talking to them........ I say Hell NO !!! When Slash was playing the Guitar IT WAS SCREMING AT ME , MAKING MY EYES & EARS GUSH WITH BLOOD!!! but ya know in a good way ...Axl would do the same with  his voice, in even more ouchy way .ONE of the GREATEST BANDS EVER *PERIOD* Nuff Said
B00097A5HW|5.0|One of the two strongest works to date -- the second one being Donde Estan Los Ladrones -- from quite easily the most talented pop musician of our time, and perhaps of all times. And I mean \\"pop\\" in a good way, as a characteristic of extreme versatility and ability to create the most beautiful melodies. The level of Shakira's involvement and control over the music she makes is astonishing. More than anyone else these days, she can be called the one and only author of her albums, and this yet increases my fascination with this latest work of hers. The melodies are spellbinding, her unbelievably mature, amazing vocal stretches from whisper to unreachible hights in one phrase, the production is impecable, the lyrics (if you care reading translations on DualDisk or on the web) could be published as a book in their own right...  <br /> <br />I don't want to start with naming my favoriotes on the album, I only wish to say that the skip button simply has no value for this CD - all song are gems. The fact that nearly every single one of them has been called a favorite by one reviewer or another is a proof that there's not a single weak song here. They all are radically different and yet the album in its entirety feels very cohesive, much more cohesive than Laundry Service or Pies Descalzos for example, probably because of the even strength of the material. <br /> <br />In two words: simply stunning.
B000002JS6|5.0|Greatest band to ever step on stage . I have seen AC/DC every time Angus and the boys came to Indianapolis since Back in Black tour . Hell they even sleep with a few stripers I've known........( years back )Angus is THE ONLY TRUE guitar GOD ,Bon Scott was the best front man of his time, If not all time. Malcom & Cliff great guys that can play with the best of 'em ,Phil Rudd will beat the hell out of some skins and never miss a lick . and for the rest of the drummers that played on so many badass albums, you too ROCK! MY FRIENDS.***** 5 STARS***** from me. Hell I even have a AC/DC Tattoo to show off .
B000056NX5|4.0|As a young kid of thirteen, I was not religious...I didn't go to see the movie for any other reason then having the concept album from 1971. It wa a \\"ROCK OPERA\\". I LOVED the film and<br /><br />watched it MANY times SINCE. Now, some many years later, I still<br /><br />LOvE both and I AM a Christian. It doesn't offend...<br /><br />I LOVE this one too...I've seen it MANY times, and a copy of it...It still MOVES me like it did when I was a kid. I LOVE the score, and I don't take it as anything more then entertainment.<br /><br />It's AMAZING, how POWeRFUL this version is! I especially liked Jerome Pradon as Judas. Check it out!<br /><br />  If you want to know Christ, go to church or read the Gospels.<br /><br />Jesus Christ Superstar I think helped START my own FAITH journey. Enjoy it!

B0002EXH54|5.0|one of the best driving metal records/cass/CD ever. pop it in, turn it up ,hit the highway at about 120 mph ....just try it you'll like it
B000000WFZ|5.0|Gabriel's Oboe is worth the price of the cd! My review may not be fair, as I haven't seen the movie. Thus I am judging this cd on its own merit without benefit of a storyline. I found a few of the tracks unnerving to the point of complete irritation. I love Morricone, especially Cinema Paradiso, which is among my favorites. Still, Gabriel's Oboe is so magnificent, so pure and full of longing, that it redeems the rest of the cd. I plan on seeing the movie, which may confer a change of heart with the rest of the music.

B0009W5JS2|2.0|When will Hollywood learn, is a question many people have often asked regarding numerous choices Hollywood has made in regards to movie franchises.  For instance, when will Hollywood learn that some movies should never have sequels, or some sequels should only be made if it can surpass the quality of the original?  Another question is, when will Hollywood learn that when the star and director of a film does not want to return for the sequel because the material is not as good as the original film's, is a bad sign and that the sequel should not be made.  That last question for Hollywood is perfectly applicable to \\"xXx: State of the Union\\" or \\"xXx 2: The Next Level\\" as it was called at one point and may have been the working title in some areas.  <br /> <br />\\"xXx: State of the Union\\", as it was called here in the states, does not follow the further adventures of C.I.A. special `xXx' agent Xander Cage, after the original film's star Vin Diesel and director Rob Cohen decided to leave the film after the script was completed.  Leaving the studio with the task of finding a new lead actor/actress to take over as the next `xXx'.  Which is how \\"xXx: State of the Union\\" begins, after an attack on a C.I.A. compound, C.I.A. agent Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson reprising his role) sets out to recruit a new `xXx' to take the place of Xander Cage who apparently has been murdered, though this is never seen on camera so it seems the studio is holding out hope that Vin Diesel will change his mind and appear in \\"xXx 3\\" if it ever gets made.  In his search, Gibbons decides that he doesn't have the time or luxury of testing his new candidate, instead he only chooses from one man, Darius Stone (Ice Cube).  Stone is a former military man that worked with Gibbons and staged a revolt against a general (Wilem Dafoe, who appears to be sleeping through his role as the villain here), the same general also happens to be Secretary of Defense and is behind the attack on the C.I.A. as a part of his plan to replace the President of the United States, whom he feels makes the U.S. look weak to our enemies.  When Gibbons and several other key members that run the `xXx' program are abducted, Darius Stone must call in some \\"special\\" back-up to help him stop the revolution before it's too late. <br /> <br />Some film franchises can survive having new lead characters be in each film, or having the same lead characters but different actors playing them, while sadly other franchises cannot.  Some franchises that have made this work to some extent, are as follows:  `The Crow' franchise (some fans would disagree), `Batman' franchise (at least until \\"Batman & Robin\\"), and of course the most successful would be `007'.  However, the success that these film franchises have enjoyed through all the changes, was not to be shared by the `xXx' franchise.  Lets face it, Ice Cube is not Vin Diesel, the story was not nearly as good, the special effects didn't even look that good, and the directing was not the best.  I'm not saying the Rob Cohen is the best director, but Lee Tomahori should have done better.  My reason for saying Lee Tomahori should have done better, is because his previous film was the superb entry into the `James Bond' series with, \\"007: Die Another Day\\".  To go from what is one of the best `Bond' films to this crap is shocking, what was he thinking.  I mean the first sign as I said before that this film should have been avoided was the fact that Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen both passed on it, I wonder if Lee Tomahori even read the script before agreeing to make the movie. <br /> <br />The `xXx' franchise showed promise with an enjoyable first film, however this lackluster sequel took away any interest in seeing any new versions of `xXx'.  The only way this franchise could get off the ground again, would be for Vin Diesel and Rob Cohen to return for \\"xXx 3\\", which based on the numbers this movie made at the box office is not looking too good, I see crappy Direct-to-DVD sequels in this franchise's future.  And these Direct-to-DVD sequels won't be as good as those of `The Crow' and `Prophecy' franchises. <br /> <br />\\"xXx: State of the Union\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and sensuality.
0312995423|4.0|I sought this book out because of the author's other 3 books, which I had read and enjoyed. The storyline was basically one cliffhanger after another, as in the other books. The art of the narrow escape is evidently one of Brown's strong points. I had a couple of other books going, but put them aside until I finished this one. My only complaints were that the heroine turns into a wimp at the end and the big secret which all the genuises seek is blatantly obvious to a knowledgeable reader---yet they don't see it. Other than that, the book was enjoyable.
B0002OERI0|5.0|After the less than stellar album \\"Warning:\\", Green Day needed to find a way to make their next album even better. They managed to do that, with the rock-opera \\"American Idiot\\". This album tells the story of Jesus of Suburbia, and his realization of his life. He goes from his life with a neglient mother (2. Jesus of Suburbia), to leaving his hometown in hopes to discover more. His adventure begins happily (Holiday), but then turns bad (Boulevard of Broken Dreams). Fed up with his boring life (Are We the Waiting?), Jesus decides to go under a radical change into a new persona (St. Jimmy). St. Jimmy meets up with a girl, who is a rebel, just like he wishes to be (She's a Rebel). After falling madly in love with her, he is unable to give her what she deserves due to his insecurity after his troubled childhood and his identity change (Extraordinary Girl). She later writes him a letter, stating that she is leaving him and the city (Letterbomb). He later decides to dump his St. Jimmy alter-ego, and head back to his home (Homecoming). He spends the rest of his life wondering what would've happened if he stayed with that girl (Whatsername).<br /><br />While the story may sound a tad emo, it doesn't stop Green Day from making an amazing album. The unforgettable themes and lyrics make American Idiot one of, if not the, best album of 2004. Do yourself a favor, and listen to some of the stuff that hasn't become massive hits. They'll sound a lot better, and you'll get a fuller understand of what the album means. Also, don't forget to check out of some Green Day's older music, which contains some of the best songs ever.
B000003TAW|5.0|Is the title to this review a bit grandiose?  Yes.  Is it fitting?  Absolutely.  This is the finest piece of music ever recorded in my opinion and I will battle any music snob tooth and nail to convince them.  But for those of you who want to bypass my rant and enjoy Weezer for their sheer amazingness (yes that is a word) than I give you a rundown of each song on the album. <br /> <br />1. My Name is Jonas- Simply anthemic, from the jangly guitar in the beginning to the driving chorus this song is the perfect openning to the album.  With intriguing, funny lyrics and perfect poppy guitar work this song will force you to keep listening. 9/10 <br /> <br />2. No One Else- An anthem for anyone who has been considered \\"more of a best friend\\" (anyone who this has happened to will know EXACTLY what that entails), this song has the jump-up-and-down post-punkiness that gives Weezer their punch. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />3. The World Has Turned and Left Me Here- A true Rivers Cuomo masterpiece, this song will grab your attention and keep hold of it till long after the music has ended.  When Rivers belts out \\"Do you believe?\\" at the end you will be on your feet screaming \\"YES!\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />4. Buddy Holly- As this is the song that threatened to turn Weezer into an MTV novelty band in 1994, some fans dislike this song.  While Weezer's more distorted live versions of this one are much better than the album version, Buddy Holly is no slouch, and it's hard to beat the high-note climax towards the end.   8/10 <br /> <br />5. Undone (the Sweater Song)- A tribute ballad to slackers everywhere, Undone is another well-known, radio-friendly single.  This doesn't by any means make it a bad song however, and it's mellow bits compounded with rocking choruses will win you over all over again. 9/10 <br /> <br />6. Surf Wax America- Somewhere, Brian Wilson is smiling at the thought of a new generation listening to this song.  All Beach Boys comparrisons aside, this song is a definite rock-outand is a great upbeat jammer.  9.5/10 <br /> <br />7. Say It Ain't So- The mere mention of this song gives me goosebumps and it's easy to understand why.  This is not only the best song on the album but my favorite song of all-time.  Everytghing about it is amazing and it will continuously make you wonder why today's newer bands can't accomplish anything even close to this. 11/10  <br /> <br />8. In the Garage- A very personal song about the early days of Weezer.  Lyrically very well thought out and a great rallying cry for those of us who were, shall we say, less than popular in high school ;-).  9/10 <br /> <br />9. Holiday- Not the best song on the album but still very good.  The end is very well-done and a neat throwback to older music. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />10. Only in Dreams- The closer for this masterpiece album, this nearly eight minute classic is simply wonderful with an almost Dave Matthews-like slow build and climax.  The end of a classic album that is worth many times the amount you will pay for it.
B00097DX3U|5.0|It was only five years ago that Rage Against the Machine disbanded, leaving Morello, Commerford, and Wilk to hook up with Cornell. Now Audioslave has released their sophmore album, titled \\"Out of Exile\\". The main goal the band wishes to accomplish is to move away from a \\"Rage Against the Machine + Soundgarden\\" sound, to their own \\"Audioslave\\" sound. They make a great step towards defining that sound with this album. Tom Morello shows off his amazing guitar skills by the many complex guitar solos scattered across the album. This is a great Alternative Rock album, one that I would recommend to anyone. The great (and clean) lyrics, merged with Tom's  guitaring, Chris' unique style of vocals, and the many talents of Brad and Tim make Out of Exile a album worth checking out.
0743454529|5.0|this is one of the most thought provoking stories i have ever read. this is the tale of a family whos youngest child of thirteen named anna is filing for medical emancipation. she wants this because ever since she was born she has been a doner for her older sister kate who was diagnosed with leukimia. the problem ISNT that she doesnt want her sister to live she loves her sister with all of her heart and without her kate dies because anna is a perfect doner for her sister, its that she never had a choice on if she wanted to donate her insides to put it bluntly.   this book gives the point of view of all the characters in this story and is written in a way where it is hard to decide for yourself what is right and is wrong . the only problem i had with this story is basically that the ending is depressing. but i give it a five in spite of that.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Okay...maybe not cheerful but its pretty light stuff compared to his last albums. Now I'm not really a big NIN fan. I own Pretty Hate Machine, Broken, The Downward Spiral and The Fagile but thats as far as it goes. I'm just a casual listener who enjoys what this man has got to offer, not some devotee.  I enjoyed this album more then I thought. Its very poppy and yes, pretty groovey, with plenty of bass. The lyrics didn't surprise me. Trent is obviously the same angry man-child he's always been, but unlike some, that doesn't bother me. The lyrics may be his weakest yet but at least it wasn't another album hell-bent on dictating the evils of war(SOAD, APC). I find I can just switch it on and smile to myself, thinking: \\"There he goes again, bless him\\".With Teeth or Awith tha Teetha! as some have not so affectionately described it, is really sexy and one of my favorite tracks. Sunspots is another and Only is a highly amusing song on self harm. If you can't appreciate the funny side to this album, you need to lighten up. Take it with a pinch of salt. This guy does have a sense of humour. Those still hung up on NIN being a Skinny Puppy rip off need to move on. I love Skinny Puppy, but I like to have balance in what i listen too. Its good Karma. A bit of Too Dark Park followed by Pretty Hate Machine, a bit of Strappng Young Lad and then some nice HIM to round it off. Hell i might even put on a bit of Beijing Opera to wind me down. So there you have it.  To the casual music buyer, give Trent a try. I would say this is his most accessible album on par but not similar to Pretty Hate Machine. Its his most organic effort.  Thanks for reading, I can feel a bit of Rammstein coming on...
078322737X|4.0|Before Lucas' world wide phemoneon was seen by millions, a box office classic hit he directed was seen in 1973, a film that read \\"where were you in 62\\"  \\"American Graffiti\\" a fun drama showcasing the rock 'n' rollin and wild teen scene of 1962. Starring Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard and a breif appearance by Harrison Ford who as everyone knows would later be a space mercenary pirate and a wip cracking archeaologist for Lucas. The best teen movie I've ever seen and a very different one from American Pie and the Breakfast Club. it's about an era and the teens who experience it. a triumphfant classic that teens in 62 should be proud of. If you loved Star Wars then see Lucas' early american classic.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Overall,this movie was okay. At first, being an avid fan of Homer's Iliad, and of Greek mythology, I was utterly dissapointed and surprised with the inacuracy of this picture. Not only was the casting off, but also tons of people who survived the Iliad die, and tons who die live! Many characters (ie. Cassandra, Hecuba, the Amazons,) are excluded, when they would have made the film better. Too much of the film is spent on shots of Achilles (Brad Pitt) walking around or gazing meditatively in the sky with his shirt off, or spouting philosphical dribble.  But, if one considers the movie itself, not comparing it to the Iliad, it was not displeasing. The cinematography was great, with breathtaking scenes, as were the sets, which were acurate with their thick columns and primitive looking statues. The shots of the ships heading for Troy, the city itself, and its tragc, but darkly beautiful, distruction- a proud and beautiful city glowing with fire, statues toppling...an empire at its defeat. Hector and Andromache were very well played, and Orlando Bloom did a good job being a spoiled, cowardly prince, which was probably not hard for him, being so close to what he is. Sean Bean was a wonderful Odysseus, witty and clever, and also Agamemnon was quite good, though he differed in character greatly from the Agamemnon of the Iliad. Briseis was well developed and clever also. The music was probably the best part of this movie, with great climactic pieces (such as the death of Achilles) and slow, erie songs that fit the scenes. The drums in The Death of Hector are amazing, and the tragic, beautiful music played during the destruction of the city is heartwrenchingly good. I greatly recommend the soundtrack to any fans of the movie or interested consumers. The special effects were amazing, and the battle scenes were well done. I especially loved the Trojan attack on the Greek camp with the balls of flaming straw. It was pretty ingenious. Leave it to Hector.  Reguarding life and death of the characters- (this contains spoilers, obviously,) I thought it was fitting that Agamenmom die as he was painted out as a nasty, greedy, selfish tyrant, and the way in which he was killed was awesome. When I saw Briseis, the seemingly helpless girl in the clutches of the tyrant, reveal the dagger in her palm, I was exhilerated. If he had to go, it was a good way. The death of Menelaus was not as good, and I felt it should have been ommitted. Brad Pitt did a terrible job dying in the film, taking about ten minutes to talk to Briseis, then promptly falling over and dying. I felt that Paris should have died, not just because Orlando Bloom practically ruined the movie with his dreadfully cheesy overdone acting, but just because it should not have been a happy ending with Paris and Helen together happily ever after. The death of Hector was devestating, but well done, and necessary. The fact that Helen fled with Andromache into the tunnels below the city was strange- in the Iliad she's taken back to Mycenae and lives there for the rest of her life, and Andromache is also, though she's enslaved, reduced to a prisoner, watching helplessly as her baby is thrown off of the walls of Troy because he's seen as a threat, an avenger of his father. So, save the death of Agamemnon, and that of Hector, the deaths were not very good. Few and far between.  Overall, Troy is a mediocre take-off of a great epic, but a good film all the same, though it cowers in the shadow of Homer's Iliad.
0553579908|5.0|Martin manages to exceed expectations with his sequel to Game of Thrones. The story picks up with Eddard Stark dead and his family scattered across Westeros. Robb has proclaimed himself King in the North and is waging war against the Lannisters. Arya is on her way north, disguised as a peasant boy. Sansa is a captive of the cruel thirteen-year-old king Joffrey and his calculating mother Cersei, and Bran and Rickon are still in Winterfell. Jon Snow is on the Wall, protecting the other side of the realm from an army of zombie-like creatures called \\"The Others.\\" <br /> <br />Some other favorite characters are back as well, including Dany, Tyrion and Shae, and Martin introduces the perspectives of Davos and Theon. <br /> <br />Clash of Kings ups the suspense and drama Martin began in Game of Thrones. The Kingdom is divided among four would-be kings, and one queen across the sea is making her way for Westeros. Good men are brought low, and villains are raised as heroes. There's epic battle, sorcery, sex, and courtly intrigue--in sort everything to keep you reading until 2 a.m.  <br /> <br />After 1000 pages I put the novel down and thought, \\"Ok, where's the next one?\\" <br />
B00008EY65|4.0|I didn't like the movie honestly! of course it had some strong points. one of the most important prominences of this movie was the right and enoght imagination. they didn't bring us something unique at the price of sacrificing the impression of the film. It's a tradition in these days movies that they want to depict new versions of well known monsters and heroes and the consequences most of the times will be ridiculous and critical phenomenons! Fortunately I saw one of the best remakes of comic heroes in this movie! Hellboy was astonishingly brilliant and realistic. Visuals and CGs of this movie were excellent and looked realistic too. The only critical and unsophisticated character of the movie was \\"The Corpse\\"! the reason that I didn't like this movie was it's scenario. I think it's not dynamic enough. It's good and reasonable but it's not dynamic. there is not a jaw dropping action scene that makes you screen or jump out of your sit and there is not a hanging story that encourage you to watch it till the end. they tried to bring us both action and mystery. and they didn't succeed in both, specially the mystery! I can't give this movie more than 3 stars. but It's a 5 star DVD set!<br /><br />This DVDs design is a masterpiese! you'll get all you want, synchronized and real time! this is not the begining of new type of DVD production. I've seen such thing before in New Line Infinifilm series but, the job they've done here, is the peak of it! and made this DVD set a matter of hours and even days of entertainment! I admire them for the brilliant and revolutionary DVD release and I bought this movie only for the DVD options.
B000002OZY|5.0|This was my favorite LP for a lot of years when I was younger. It's the story of an unfortunate little boy who never got to know his father, was exploited by his family, abused by relatives, comes out of that, rises to celebrity status, and even though he loses it all, he regains his spirituality, and drifts off into infinity, his spirituality in tact.<br /><br />I think a lot of people are lost on the concept of pinball, and its relationship to the Tommy story; the song \\"Pinball Wizard\\" was thrown in towards the end of the recording sessions, because the whole work, as good as it was, needed a \\"hook\\" to catch people's ear, right away. The idea of someone becoming a pinball champion, idolized and revered, is pretty typical of society's desire, and unfortunate need, for someone outside themselves to admire. This is not to disparage someone like Tiger Woods, he's a great golfer, but look at how popular and successful he is, just for hitting a little white ball into a little hole, with a club. It's a difficult skill, one that I don't have, and if he enjoys it, and makes a really good living at it, more power to him.<br /><br />Now, transpose this concept to an autistic person who can't see or hear, but can keep a pinball game going, better than anyone else; it's got to be almost supernatural, God-inspired. The rallies and championships depicted in the film version rival any televangelist appearance, with that \\"freak-show\\" element thrown in for good measure.<br />After his \\"miracle Cure,\\" he is now a modern-day Messiah in the eyes of the public, they all covet his standing  as someone who overcame the most debilitating circumstances imaginable, and they want to be like him. He foolishly starts to believe that he is all they say he is, and his own self-absorption, combined with his followers' resentment of him for not being what they expected, brings the whole empire down, in ruins.<br /><br />The depth of this material is offset by the innocent quality of the music, a loud, violent band like the who, playing a mostly quiet double-length recording, was a departure, the choir-like harmonies are pleasing to the ear, while the songs depict a boy witnessing a crime, and being told he didn't see it, or hear it, he'll never tell anyone about it, his subsequent isolation, safety from the world, in silent darkness, a horrifying way to live.<br /><br />It has traces of optimism in it, the strongest line in the whole piece, being, \\"I have no reason to be over-optimistic, but, somehow, when you smiled, I could brave bad weather.\\"  That is a powerful line, and can be used in anyone's life.<br /><br />So don't let the detractors fool you; this is an excellent body of work, performed by a genius band; far-fetched storyline, lots of really grubby little sub-plots, seedy, disturbing images in the lyrics, but the fade-out is a prayer that can be directed at any deity, fading off into the distance, leaving you with the silence of your own thoughts.<br /><br />A common mistake made by fans of The Who, is the one of \\"Tommy's Holiday Camp\\" being written by Keith Moon; it wasn't. While the music was being recorded, and Townshend was trying to explain the story line to the others, he asked John Entwistle to write \\"Fiddle About\\" and \\"Cousin Kevin,\\" due in part, to Entwistle's super-dark humor in his lyrics, for a little comic relief, and Moon had the idea of Tommy running a \\"Holiday Camp\\" like the ones they have in England. A silly song called \\"Cobwebs and Strange\\" was earlier credited to Moon, although it was developed by the whole band and given to him, so Townshend wrote \\"Holiday Camp,\\" and gave the credit to Moon here as well, as it was his idea. And in the film and stage productions in the '70's what better person for the part of Wicked Uncle Ernie?<br /><br />The unfortunate part of \\"Tommy's\\" success, was, is it was SO popular, that it was all the audiences came to see for a while, and it threw all four members of the band into disillusionment withtheir own success.<br /><br />But, it all worked out, and we now have a brilliant piece of music, a timeless classic.ave a brilliant piece of music, a timeless classic.
0743244257|2.0|Don DeLillo is a frustrating writer.  He can write masterpieces, like \\"White Noise\\" and \\"Mao II\\".  He can write generally entertaining novels like \\"Running Dog\\" and \\"The Body Artist\\".  And he can write inpenetrable tomes like \\"Underworld\\" and \\"Libra\\".  But at least the difficult books get credit for the effort.  The worst kind of DeLillo book is the pretentious diatribe, where DeLillo simply has his characters go around meeting people and having odd experiences, all the while waxing philosophic about the state of the world.  \\"Americana\\", his first book, was like that.  And now we  have \\"Cosmopolis\\", which is cut from the same narrative cloth.    DeLillo's strength has always been in his brilliant description, pinning down minute details in interesting ways.  That's present in \\"Cosmopolis\\", but too often the voice of the writer ends up in the mouths of the characters.  Everyone speaks with the same vocabulary.  Every character is reading from the same script, like they're all auditioning to be the lead in a DeLillo book.  As a result, there's not a person in the story who isn't a raving phony.      Worse than that, DeLillo clearly has complete contempt for the entire population of his book.  No one -- not the young new-tech tycoon, crashing and burning; not his flighty poet wife; not his disdainful chief of security; nor his would-be assassin or any of the cameo players who pass through the story and into oblivion -- no one is depicted in a remotely postive light.  There's no one to identify with, let alone sympathize with.      So who cares?  What's the point of spending 200+ pages with these people if you can't bring yourself to care what happens to them?  \\"Cosmopolis\\" is a concept, not a story.  \\"What if a rich guy got stuck in traffic driving across Manhattan, and the longer he's stuck there the more money he loses?\\"  When there is character growth, it's spurred by ridiculous events, clearly forced.  Even if you accept the oddities of DeLillo's universe, it's still impossible not to think, This is not what would really happen.    For a book whose title suggests a kind of urban spirtuality, it's remarkably soulless.  I haven't read all of DeLillo's books, but among the ones I have read, this is one of the worst.  It may also be the last.
B00005JNSK|1.0|I saw the Roald Doal book adaptation of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" and I think Johnny should get away from the Chocolate Factory and get aboard the Black Pearl, but he will next summer in \\"Pirates of the Carribean: Dead Man's Chest\\" I thought the original was way better, it's a classic. This newis not. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan since Captain Jack Sparrow, but I like Gene Wilder better for Willy Wonka. Johnny only belongs on the Black Pearl from now on. \\"Finding Neverland\\" was very good, \\"Secret Window\\" was good and \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" as even better than \\"Charles\\" If your a Johnny Depp fan still give it a try and see how you get cinema cancer. As great as an actor Johnny is, I guess they can't be winners can they. He was weird in a gay manner.
B000957O82|5.0|The famous Uruguayan poet August Benedetti, wrote sometime a poem named: \\"Tactic and strategy\\" in which he stated: \\"My tactic is to want you ; my strategy is to love you\\".<br />And that is, precisely what it happens in this clever comedy about the role of hitch; he is a love advisor but you must remind Goethe' s famous statement in Faust: \\"Grey my friend is all theory and green the golden tree of the life.\\"<br />Hitch's mission is to support and essential information about the women's psychology, what they really want, wish and expect, the use of the body language, the importance of a look, and the adequate employment of a phrase in the right moment. He suggest them that under no circumstance they must allow his real will emerges, creating a stereotyped model without loosing spontaneity, but you know how it is; he will live in new flesh the sum of his contradictions, falling down twice in his raising date, and forgetting that the love is much wiser than we pretend to know because the imagination and the taste is such elusive and subjective matter that many successful accidents will work out as the real hook to find his expected love.<br />Funny, original and smart entertaining film that links with that Trufautt ' s lovely film \\"The man who loved women\\" and showing that the author cinema is coming back, fortunately in USA, because the creative process has been growing in the last decade, at short steps, if you want but that means something. From American Beauty to Madison Bridges, Magnolia and Mulholland drive, Matrix to Requiem for a dream, and As good as it gets to The notebook you will find there are not preconceived barriers when the creativity runs freely.
B000063DFN|5.0|\\"Powerslave\\" is a prime example of everything fitting perfectly into place (musically speaking).  Released in 1984, the album set a new standard for heavy metal, and its influence on the genre is still visible today.  Singer Bruce Dickinson has never sounded better, and the rest of the band are on par.  Kicking off with the inimitable \\"Aces High,\\" the CD at once grabs you with its pitch-perfect blend of heaviness and melody, as well as the guitarists' great playing abilities in both fields.  The opener is a truly great song about military pilots, and it features a catchy, rhythmic introduction that you can really bang your head to.  Next up is \\"Two Minutes to Midnight,\\" one of Maiden's most popular songs and another standout track.  \\"Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)\\" is a decent instrumental track that, while not quite matching the greateness of the first two songs, is still far from filler.  \\"Flash of the Blade\\" is the first part of the saga of a young swordsman, and is another great song.  Part two of the story is called \\"The Duellists\\" and is actually one of my favorite songs on the CD (and I know I'm in the minority here).  \\"Back in the Village\\" is without a doubt the weakest song here, but it's really not that bad.  \\"Powerslave\\" is another one of the best songs on the CD, and uses the mysteries of ancient Egypt as its theme.  The last song on the album is where its true beauty lies, though, in the form of \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\\" a thirteen-minute-plus masterpiece that has become one of many Maiden fans' all-time favorite songs.  Overall, \\"Powerslave\\" is probably Maiden's best and most popular album (although \\"The Number of the Beast\\" is a close contender), and undoubtedly my favorite from their catalog.
0393312836|5.0|I don't know what's wrong with some of you people like the one reviewer who read the book when they were 19 years old and didn't like it. Grow up first then read it, maybe then you'll understand all the adult context. The other review from Utah asking why is the main character Alex so violent when he grew <br />up in a loving home. What planet do you live on? Even in the real world people grow up in real loving homes and commit violent <br />crimes,get a clue. <br />This book was very powerful and lets us look at a point of view <br />most of us don't even know about.The view of a troubled,violent <br />teenager. It also makes us think wether or not it better for us to have freedom of choice or to lose our freedom for the safety <br />of our society. When it comes down to it programming someone to be good,really doesn't make them a good person just a robot. <br />Just read the book because it's though provoking and form your <br />own EDUCATED though.
B000007T1M|5.0|This album makes absolutely no sense. <br />It doesn't matter though, it has crazy lyrics and crazy melodies, and defies all genres. It is nu-metal, but just because it is new and it is metal. There is no other way to describe them. Daron Malakian shows he can actually play guitar on Soil, and the only hit off this album, Sugar, doesn't even make sense and just talks about mushroom people. <br />Serj is an amazing singer and actually sounds like he knows what he is talking about. <br />In a perfect world, this would be the Dark Side of the Moon of Nu-metal, because it makes about as much sense and is just about as influental. <br />One last thing, buy this album because it is good, not because it is political. There is really only one political song, and the best song on the album, P.L.U.C.K., calling for recognition of the Armenian genocide of the 1920s.
B000002JS6|5.0|So, it's AC/DC's back in black. Quite a blow away album. See, I don't know alot about AC/DC. I'm more a Van Halen type of fan. Weren't AC/DC and Van Halen in some type of heat? Alright now. <br /> <br />My favorite track is probably \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\". I wouldn't be surprised if that was a huge makeout song back in the 80's. \\"Rock and Roll ain't noise pollution\\" is a song that is also a true fact. It's got a great introduction. Most of these songs on the CD are great. AC/DC really kicked alot of ass when this came out in 1980. <br /> <br />But as you can see, I'm not a huge AC/DC fan. This is one of my favorite albums of all time however. <br /> <br />Basically, if you are a Van Halen fan, you will like this music. If you are a fan of any bands like Van Halen, you will like AC/DC. If you like Kiss, you will like AC/DC.  <br /> <br />I don't know alot about AC/DC.
B000021YQV|4.0|Prison Song-Just a song about prisons and drugs and stuff, weird, but a good opener. <br />Needles-This is a crazy song. Very heavy. Like their first album, they are continuing to not make sense. The whole band sounds very into this song. I just realized that this album is different, there is no f-word at all so far. <br />Deer Dance-Light vocals over crazy melodies and getting heavy again. System of a Down's lyrics are starting to get political and make more sense. <br />Jet Pilot-WHY WERE THE EYES OF A HORSE ON A JET PILOT? This whole song seems pretty drug-influenced, and could have been on the first album. <br />X-Daron rips the intro to this song, then the whole band goes into heaviness. More classic, nonsensical SOAD. <br />Chop Suey!-Despite the random title, this song actually makes sense and is a good song to listen to you if you are feeling down, and it is surprisingly a very sad song for SOAD. Quoting Jack Black \\"It sounds f-ing important that angels deserve to die! It's about nothing.\\" It actually sounds like it's about someone being depressed after breaking up and the ending is very melodic. <br />Bounce-Now we get back into heaviness. This song is about sex i think. Or it is about \\"Pogo Sticks\\". Hey who knows, right? <br />Forest-This song gets a little lighter, and is generally following the theme of more melodic, cleaner SOAD, but still follows the the theme of nonsense combined with political statements. This album was released a week before 9-11, so it is mostly criticizing pre-9-11 America. <br />ATWA-So now there is more melodic slowness. Way more than on their first album. You can tell Serj had a breakup before recording this album. They like the theme of going slow to hard. <br />Science-Yet another great intro courtesy of Daron Malakian. Just about what it sounds like. Some random noise in the bridge. This album has a lot less guitar work. <br />Shimmy-A pretty random song that sounds like it could have been on the first album. It's true purpose is to lead up to the next album. Don't be late for school again. <br />Toxicity-This is the theme song of the album. It's whole purpose is to bring System of a Down's craziness to the mainstream and it suceeded. The lyrics are just about modern life through SOAD's eyes, so they make no sense. The chorus is insanely fun and crazy and helped this song become a mainstream song. If your just looking for a good metal album, buy Toxicity just for this song, because it is a classic. <br />Psycho-This starts out really weird, probably for SOAD to get away from the mainstreamness of Toxicity. This song has four words to describe it. Psycho! Groupie! Cocaine! Crazy! Makes You High! Wonder if this is the same chick from Chop Suey! and ATWA. <br />Aerials-A pretty good song to finish off the very good, although somethimes shaky, album
B0002KVUKM|4.0|I thought I would hate this movie, but I like it very much. It takes place in a parallel universe where all monsters of literature live and interact with each other and kill each other and die (maybe). Hugh Jackman is so pretty as Van Helsing, NOT the one from literature, who **** SPOILERS ***** turns out to be the Angel Gabriel with memory loss and who also becomes a werewolf and bites Dracula on the neck. I hope by now you have quit expecting a dreary fantasy drama. Unlike with Star Rings and Lord of the Wars, this one really doesn't feel like a video game for boys. This is a breathless romp (bated breath, not no-breath-dead), with lovely hunk Jackman, fun sidekicks, beautiful babes with brains, furry animals, oceans, mountains, forests, castles, the Vatican, you name it. AND, the DVD comes with a blooper feature. Everyone sings and dances and laughs.  Please view and have fun.
B000003CMC|5.0|Yes, of course you could call the Allman Bros. a Southern Rock ensemble, but as this album shows, this band was far, FAR deeper (and better) than your run-of-the mill Southern rockers like .38 Special. In fact they are more of a jazz-rooted ensemble with jazzy  instrumental textures. Listen to \\"Les Brers in A minor,\\" for an excellent example of their interaction. Each member takes a solo (except for Oakley) and each is concise and to the point while the  members LISTEN to each other and build intensity along with the soloist. And the improv never seem to go on too long, unlike Skynyrd, even on \\"Mountain jam,\\" which ABB fans (like myself) love but newcomers  to the ABB live experience will most likely find impossible to digest in one sitting.  <br /> <br />Though I agree that Live at the Fillmore East is better (despite the seemingly sacriligeous editing and splicing between different performances) and this album is a bit of a hastily-assembled patch job, the music in the grooves is pure gold. Gregg Allman once again proves himself as a man of many talents; as well as possessing one of the more soulful white voices in rock history (along with Michel McDonald and John Fogerty), he's a superb pianist and a criminally underrated songwriter. I mean, just listen to \\"Ain't Wastin' No Time No More\\" and \\"Melissa\\" and tell me he isn't one of the best composers of his generation.  <br /> <br />As for Duane, he is sorely missed. Derek Trucks is excellent, but he's no Duane Allman. His death stands as one of the premier rock 'n roll tragedies, along with Hendrix and Randy Rhoads. He gave the  ABB a fire that not even Dickey Betts himself could recreate and the band was never quite the same after his passing, so this  Eat a Peach turns out to be a perfect epitaph.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|When I first bought this CD, I had only listened to a few Beatles songs. Let It Be, Yellow Submarine, Eleanor Rigby, and Yesterday to be precise. To think I had not heard of Hey Jude, or any of the other wonderful songs on this album! They were bound to be good. I mean, they were all number one hits after all. This CD has made me a huge Beatles fan. I'm sure it will make others too. I've listened to other songs by The Beatles not included in this album too. Being 13 myself, I think this CD is a great way for younger generations to be Beatles fans.
B0009MDPYM|1.0|Lazy adaptation of the comic book Hellblazer lacks the drama and horror of that book and put in a dumb sense of humor that not only does not fly but has a leading man that does not do his character any justice at all. I'm not as hard as a lot of people are on Keanu Reeves because I think he has a certain charm to him but I have to agree with the majority that he is sourly miscast in the role of John Constantine. He does not come across well and his brooding streak does not fit the character at all. He acts more like Batman than the charming and humorous John Constantine of the comic books and the performance he gives is not very good at all because of it. The story is not very compelling at all and it feels like it was rush into production with out a single rewrite to put things in order because everything feels like it has no structure at all. The special effects also feel rushed and certain scenes actually feel awkward because of the direction, which is pretty bad. The ending of the film contradicts the beginning and the plot lines concerning certain characters especially John Constantine himself doesn't really fit the movie at all. The only thing that worked in this film is the performance of Rachel Weisz, which not only kept the movie from spiraling into its own vat of stupidity but also made the movie a lot more compelling than it really was.  Weisz gave this movie more dignity and substance than it deserved and her performance really does deserve a better movie than this because it's the only real thing about the entire film. You actually believe in her character and her struggles with her own faith while you don't buy the story that she is stuck in.  Rachel Weisz truly deserves all the praise she has garnered for this film and our sympathy as well for being the only good thing about it.  <br /> <br />I don't know what went wrong here but it's not a good adaptation of the comic book and it that's a major crime because the comic book is so much better than whatthis film was. <br />

B0007PAMEM|1.0|90 % of what we see on this DVD has been released on DVD in the last few years. Again a Tina Turner release where EMI/Capitol takes absolutely no effort to give fans something rare and extra. After the disappointing \\"Simply the best\\" DVD, they manage to screw it up again.  <br />

B0007P3582|4.0|Even though I am not a big fan of rap, I listened to 50's sophomore project, \\"Massacre,\\" and I was impressed. <br /> <br />\\"Disco Inferno,\\" the first single from this album, was not all that great, but \\"Candy Shop\\" featuring Olivia was a great tactic to get 50's solo career back on the map.  About two months later, this was followed by \\"Just a Lil' Bit\\" which proved to be a club-banger everywhere.  I still hear this single on the radio and I can't get enough of it because of the great job done by producer Scott Storch (\\"Lean Back\\" by Fat Joe). <br /> <br />I would like to see \\"Outta Control\\" or \\"Get in My Car\\" as the next single from his album, both are very good.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Granted, I am no professional musician, but the amount of time I have spent listening to music is quite considerable. The review prior to this one noted that very very few people who like this album could have any actual experience listening to amazing music. Well, I would consider myself that. I have listened to every Led Zeppelin album, I have all of them, they still remain my favorite band. I also have a plethora of live music from them. In addition I  have every Pink Floyd album, which I also have tons of live music, most of which is bootleg. For a long time I thought Green Day was terrible, and shared much of the same views as the reviewer prior to this one. Unfortunately, it was ignorance that blinded me. I pushed every emo band, every punk band, and many others into a taboo zone inside my head, in which I would refuse to admit any of it were good. <br /> <br />You have to understand that not all music has to be complex to be good. People tend to think that simplicity means idiocy and ignorance, and only the truly intelligent use complexity. In reality the most beautiful of creations, the most beautiful ideas are the most simple. I think it was Einstein who said that we should make things as simple as possible, but not any simpler. Einstein was not alone in this idea, many of the greatest men in history have deemed simplicity as beauty. I am not saying that since much of Green Day's music is relatively simple it must be good, I am simply stating that complexity does not mean good. <br /> <br />Now, to my review of this album. I got this album from my girlfriend soon after it came out, naturally, since at that time I dissaproved of Green Day and all music of the like, I didnt even bother listening to it. It was not until this past month that I listened to it, and I havent stopped listening since. The first 4 songs on this album are some of the best music I have heard in a long time, especially of new bands.  <br /> <br />I would be very suprised if another album came within this year to topple this one. <br /> <br />Of course, since this album is intended for the anti-government crowd, if you are one of them you will drool over some of the lyrics. I am an anti-establishment junkie myself, but I know that you do not need to be to enjoy the music, as long as you have ever been in an unfavorable situation. <br /> <br />Even if you are like I used to be, and my friend here who reviewed prior to me, I call out to you to buy this album and just listen to it, really listen, dont assume its just some junk punk-rock crap. <br /> <br />A big determiner in musical ability is the ability to have smooth transitions between tones and meanings within songs, while changing the instrumental accordingly, and throughout this entire album this is done. It is truly a masterful piece of music. <br /> <br />I recommend this album to everyone.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|Great concept, could have been better. Some really funny scenes fail due to the constant repitition of foul language and references to oral sex. It is too bad such a great idea was not really developed. This is NOT a family video, and could turn off many adults as well.
B000268QB2|4.0|It seems everyone is a critic when it comes to music, but this is an awesome CD...and a great band.  You would think the cd was $12000 instead of $12, based on the critiques.  Like most people, I have hundreds of cd's, and this is a great addition to my collection.

0670033375|4.0|I'm originally from Montana and I'm well acquainted with the Bitteroot Valley.  Jared Diamond's technique of juxtaposing far-away Norse Greenland and the Mayan Empire against something so familiar sensitized me.  From that point on, I put myself in the place of the Mayans, Easter Islanders, Chaco Canyon Anasazi and imagined their heartache and terror as the endtime of their civilizations approached.  To imagine the same on a planetary scale - That's the real lesson of the book we should all heed.  There's imminent need for government action to preserve the ecosystem.  Hmm... now who didn't sign the Kyoto accord again?

Unlike the all-American apple-pie wholesomeness of Peter Parker and Clark Kent and their respective counterparts, Bruce Wayne and his alter ego were always far more menacing, even sinister. Unfortunately, all the previous film renderings lacked this sense of dark inscrutability, ranging anywhere from the insanely Gothic to the unbearably campy, but always missing the mark.<br /><br />Not any more. Christopher Nolan brings new life to the Caped Crusader, along with a more in-depth and believable psychology than anything seen previously. Nolan brings with him the psychological sophistication of his work in \\"Memento,\\" and it shows: he tells a real story with skill and elegance. Yes, \\"Batman Begins\\" has all the elements of traditional action flicks: car-chases, fight sequences, even the now-obligatory martial-arts training duels, but it also gives us reasons that are, if not logical, at least plausible why a billionaire orphan would dress up as a nocturnal rodent and fight crime on the streets, instead of, say, joining the Peace Corps. As in \\"Memento,\\" the plot really is not essential to the story, but plots are always the same in superhero flicks anyway: Hero discovers an enemy intent on destroying the world; Hero saves World and Girl. The plot in this is similar (though Batman has a bumper crop of villains to fight rather than just one) but it is not detrimental to the film: this is a tale of ideas and motivations first, and is more than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />I can't think of anyone I'd prefer as Batman than Christian Bale: he is good-looking, but with a certain ferocity to him that works for Batman, who is here more than slightly reminiscent of another of Bale's characters with a remarkably similar name. Batman's clearly a \\"superhero,\\" but unlike previous outings it is also impossible to forget this time that he is ultimately a Man, motivated not so much by an overpowering desire to do right as to inflict serious damage on people who do wrong. There's a substantial difference.<br /><br />Bale is in prime form here, as usual, but he's got quite a supporting cast to back him up. Liam Neeson is elegant as always in what appears to be a patented mentor role, but it was a refreshing change of pace to find him driven by darker motivations than usual. Michael Caine brings a humanity to Alfred, making him a father figure to Bruce and becoming more than just the crusty facilitator we're used to. Morgan Freeman's \\"Q\\"-equivalent Lucius Fox is slightly redundant, as the third father-figure in the film, but he also brings a kindly cunning to his role that is fun to watch; he has been around long enough that he knows Wayne doesn't want gear for extreme sports, but he is also wise enough to ask no questions. The biggest surprise is perhaps Gary Oldman, who does a 180 from his usual slightly insane roles and embodies so much decent normalcy that it is slightly disconcerting in the midst of such madness. Indeed, the only weak spot in the casting is Katie Holmes as the dewy Rachel Dawes: she is amiable enough, but her smarmy debate-club delivery doesn't belong in the noir Gotham Nolan has given us; she's too young and too bathetic, and is sorely outclassed in an otherwise exceptionally outstanding ensemble.<br /><br />The production design is also outstanding. Gotham City is rotten to the core, to be sure, but there are observable vestiges of the grandeur that was, and also of the Wayne family ties to the city: Wayne Tower dominates the city centre, and the Wayne monorail - the pet project of Bruce's philanthropist father - is a now-dilapidated relic of better days. Batman's technology is not as advanced as we are used to from previous films, but this I see as an improvement rather than not. The Batmobile, for instance, resembles an unlovely cross between a Lamborghini and a Hummer - far tougher and less sleek than the others, but practical for the demands of city-saving. When it smashes into things and stays intact, I believe it's possible. I particularly like how it enters and exits the Batcave, without the luxury of lifts or hydraulics; it shoots, jet-propelled, through a waterfall into the Batcave, which is precisely that: a dark, dank, craggy mess home to some tens of thousands of bats. The Batsuit is something that looks like it might actually be an extant but neglected military prototype. And, thank God, it is presented sans the weird molded nipples. The evolution of it, particularly the Cowl, is also entertaining to watch. All this combines to give this Batman a far more realistic tone, something the franchise has long needed.<br /><br />But now let us return to Bruce Wayne for a moment. This is by far Christian Bale's most commercial film to date (ignoring 2002's forgettable \\"Reign of Fire\\"), but the actor gives no sign that he knows he's a bona fide Hunky Movie Star heading a bona fide Big-Budget Summer Blockbuster, turning in a pitch-perfectly crafted performance that threatens to make him the Definitive Batman. Bale is as good at low-key performances as he is at outlandish ones, and here he strikes a remarkable balance; his Bruce Wayne is subtle, nuanced, tormented not only by the demons of his childhood traumas but what he perceives as his continued failure to avenge them. He is extensively trained, exceedingly dedicated, but not entirely grounded; there are hints of madness in his dark eyes. Bale is debonair and suave, yes; he is completely believable as his shallow playboy persona.<br /><br />And yet even his handsome playboy is ominously rough around the edges. Bale already has experience playing spoiled, psychotic rich kids, and there are moments when Bruce Wayne says something and his voice slips into that unnervingly hollow sing-song fans of \\"American Psycho\\" remember, his vapid grin gets a little too wide and too feral, and his eyes get a familiar twinkle to them that is far from comfortable. He has a way of cocking his head, even without the bat-eared cowl, that is distinctly predatory. Bale makes Bruce Wayne something he hasn't been before: scary. One would not want to meet him in a dark alleyway, nor would one want to get on his bad side. He is a superhero who all too easily could really enjoy his work, and we know it.<br /><br />Bale has always had a knack for using his physicality to enhance his characters: in \\"Empire of the Sun\\" he went from a skipping slip of a lad to a feral survivor; in \\"American Psycho,\\" he was a ripped, six-pack-bearing, image-obsessed narcissist; in \\"The Machinist\\" he transformed into a walking skeleton, haunted nearly to his own extinction by his inner demons. Here he looks the part again: at 6'2\\", he is already the tallest of the actors to play Batman, but he is definitely the largest too, equipped with a brawny physique that looks quite capable of beating the life out of someone. It is more than eye-candy here (although I'll admit I'm happy to see him buff and beautiful again after his cadaverous turn in \\"The Machinist\\"): it makes the superhero credible when we know there is under the molded latex six-pack of the Batsuit a real, honed, physical weapon that could inflict definite and serious damage.<br /><br />One is also impressed upon in this film that Bruce's alter-ego Batman is more than a way to shoot off steam after the playboy's partying. Unlike Peter Parker, who strives to live a normal life despite his superhero responsibilities as Spider-Man, Bruce Wayne needs Batman: the two are symbiotic halves of the same whole, neither equaling a whole person and neither capable of existing without the other.<br /><br />This is definitely a Batman of the twenty-first century, informed by terrorism and 9/11. Rather than outlandish corporate villains and hedonistic monstrosities, the enemies here are idealists, warriors who fight for ideas rather than power. Ra's al-Ghul and his inscrutable League of Shadows operate covertly, infiltrating hierarchies, sabotaging economies. Here, they employ a biotoxin emptied into the water supply as a weapon; their aim is not to destroy the world, but to \\"save it from itself.\\" And not only the bad guys have been modernized; much of the Bat-gear is acquired from mothballed military projects, which all too frequently were rejected, we're told, because the government didn't feel that saving soldiers' lives were worth the expense.<br /><br />All this coalesces into not only a grown-up superhero flick but a grown-up film, period. The film has received some criticism for not playing up to the younger, more comic-book atmosphere of the others, but this is precisely one of its biggest strengths. It is concerned with adult burdens and adult methods. This Batman is part film noir and part action flick, but the two are married gracefully, without insulting the viewer's intelligence, bringing a long-overdue elegance to the franchise and offering the promise of several more fine outings to come.t is far from comfortable.

B000268QB2|5.0|I've kept hearing Keane playing on sound systems all over Bangkok, and had no idea who they were. When I finally discovered that the 4 songs I loved were all by Keane, I immediately bought the album. <br /> <br />If you don't have it already, rush out and buy it today.  It's perfect.  There isn't one song on the CD that isn't beautifully sung and with gorgeous music and lyrics. <br /> <br />A classic.
B000A88EV4|5.0|Mike Leigh's NAKED was one of the best films of the 90s. It follows the sardonic and brutal Johnny (David Thewlis) on a long weekend journey into the harsh London underground, as he berates, belittles, insults and insences everyone he meets to the point of finally being beaten up. It's poignant, thought-provoking, and brutally hilarious! <br /> <br />It also stars Gina McKee, my favorite actress (Bella in \\"Notting Hill\\", the girl in the wheel chair; and Nadia in \\"Wonderland\\") as a cafe girl who meets Johnny, takes him in, and promptly throws him out. <br /> <br />This is a GREAT FILM.
B0000DJZA5|3.0|This new edition of the classic `Let it be' of the Beatles comes announced as `the way it was meant to be', a bold argument that may not be very valid as there are two Beatles gone who couldn't partake on this project. The cover of the album is a perfect metaphor of what this album is compared to the original, nothing but a negative.<br /><br />The first thing to note on this new version of the album is the order in which the songs are presented, it has been altered and two songs were taken out, `Maggie Mae' and `Dig it'; we have now `Don't let me down' instead of the two removed.<br /><br />The sound is presented totally re-mastered and the Beatles sound as they never did before. But what do they mean with `the way it was meant to be'? That the order of the songs was different? I am afraid I have to say no, the main reason of this new version is that it was never their intention to include orchestra arrangements on the original release; the whole idea of the project was to release a live album recorded during rehearsals and with no option of mastering it later, the project never took shape quite well and the recordings were forgotten for a couple of years, until Phil Spector recovered those tapes and mixed them in studio adding the orchestra and then releasing it as `Let it be' (when the project was originally named after `Get Back')<br /><br />For some people the logic behind the Beatles reasoning may be right, but the main problem the listener will face is that we are talking about classic songs here, for over thirty years we have heard `The long and winding road' with the orchestra arrangements, so listening to this new edition can be shocking; yes, the sound is more clear, but it is definitely not the same. The same argument can be given for the rest of the album.<br /><br />The extra CD included is nothing but some rehearsals and conversations mixed all together. These may be interesting for fans, but as they did with several songs in `The Beatles Anthology' the takes were edited and you don't get to hear the complete recordings and in the order they were originally taped.<br /><br />A collector's album for fans only, I ordered my copy from Amazon and have listened to it a couple of times; honestly? I rather listen to my original `Let it be'.ology' the takes were edited and you don't get to hear the complete recordings and in the order they were originally taped.  <br /> <br />A collector's album for fans only, I ordered my copy from Amazon and have listened to it a couple of times; honestly?

B0006399FS|5.0|Unfortunately, the mythology of U2 (or just Bono in particular) have grown to such an extent as to cause many (otherwise objective music listeners) to form sharp opinions about their work irrespective of its quality. <br /> <br />Yes, U2 in HTDAAB and ATYCLB is no longer in that experimental phase which lead to such works as Achtung, Zooropa, and Pop.  But I dare any of the critics, go back and listen to those albums and ask yourself (preferably in a quiet & private place) is there really anything particularly enlightening about Discothque & Mofo?  Are songs such as \\"Staring at the Sun\\" really all that different from their current work? <br /> <br />In my opinion, there is too much conflation between musical quality and experimentality.  I think that an album succeeds (as a work of art) if its able to connect to its audience in a personal way...albums that are \\"difficult\\" or \\"growers\\" may have experimental (and every so often artistic) qualities, but that doesn't necessarily mean they succeed as works which are able to stand the test of time. <br /> <br />I've found that the same people who criticize bands such as U2 are more interested in pretentious music, which almost always communicates some cynical perspective on society/religion/technology/humanity and how life is \\"like...worthless 'n stuff\\".  Hence, they find it much easier to connect to U2s darker (and conveniently enough) more secular Achtung, Zooropa, and Pop.  Although these are harsh words, I speak as someone who used to get his kicks listening to Radiohead's \\"The Bends\\", \\"Ok Computer\\", and \\"Kid A\\" along with the work of other equally pretentious bands such as Sigur Ros.  Ultimately, I've found their message to be both uniform, stale, and inevitably boring in its constant drumbeat of depressive quazi-adolescent angst. <br /> <br />Concerning the actual album, I thought the standouts were Vertigo, Miracle Drug,  Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, Love and Peace or Else, and Original of the Species.The entire album, is absolutely infused with genuine emotion & soul...and come to think of it what more could we want from the SAME band that brough us October, The Unforgettable Fire, and the Joshua Tree anyway?

0385504209|3.0|(...)I know many are offended by the knocks against Christianity, but I don't know if anyone's pointed out that the book is asking us to believe contradictory things. Maybe there was a Goddess religion that Judeo-Christianity forcibly stamped out, maybe Mary Magdalene married Jesus and bore his child, and maybe their descendants today are protected by a secret organization that could destroy the Church by revealing the truth. But how could these all be true at the same time? If Jesus was just an ordinary mortal, then there's nothing special either about his \\"bloodline\\" or about a woman whose fame comes from her association with him. So why would a pro-Goddess group venerate Mary Magdalene any more than of any other first-century woman? And if Mary M's relationship to Jesus is part of this group's proof that Christianity is false, how will revealing that Christianity is false increase people's reverence for Mary M? She'd go down with the ship, wouldn't she? This secret \\"Priory of Sion\\" has had 2,000 years to think about it, has been led by some of history's greatest minds, and they haven't figured this out?<br /><br />Also, how is the Priory's picture of Jesus an improvement over the one that the traditional Church has allegedly foisted on us? Which is more inspiring -- the humble preacher who cared for the poor, said \\"the last shall be first\\" and promised the meek they'd inherit the earth, or someone whose \\"royal blood\\" helped carry forward an ancient dynasty? How is Jesus the Aristocrat better than Jesus the Peasant? If the Priory goes up against the Church on that one, the Church is going to win easily. For all its faults, organized Christianity did help spread the idea that a person's value has nothing to with the family, class, nation or race he or she was born into. Do the protagonists of this novel support an effort to undo that, to go back to the age of royalty? If they don't, the book fails to make that clear.<br /><br />There are other problems too -- like the notion that a serious scholar would embrace historical-critical analysis of the canonical gospels (the effort to find the legends and theological purposes behind them), then turn around and uncritically accept the non-canonical and Gnostic writings as if they were reports of historical fact. Or that he believes that the Dead Sea Scrolls discuss Jesus, which they don't. Sloppiness like this affects the story insofar as it makes our professor/hero look like an idiot, which is plainly not the author's intention. Still, despite its weaknesses and in view of the generally low standards for thrillers, I give the book three stars because it does at least play with ideas to some degree, and because the last 50 pages turned out to be better than I'd expected.ike the notion that a serious scholar would embrace historical-critical analysis of the canonical gospels (the effort to find the legends and theological purposes behind them), then turn around and uncritically accept the non-canonical and Gnostic writings as if they were reports of historical fact.

B00023B1LC|5.0|Since this movie came out on the same weekend as Minority Report, I really had only time to see one.  So I chose Minority Report and subsequently ignored the Bourne Identity for the next year.  I finally rented the movie and when I did see it, well I can't describe how surprised I was.  From the previews, I thought this would be mainly a drama w/some action, instead it was full of just the right mix of suspense and action to keep the viewer literally (that's right literally) on the edge of their seat.  Backed with a great story line, Bourne Identity takes you around the world to view the mysterious life of Jason Bourne.  With an even better sequel following this film, I reccommend this movie to EVERYONE.
B00003CXXS|3.0|The first 2 Jurassic Park's were entertaining(even 2, it had its moments) but some would say it was mired by science speak and existence questions(like whether to interfere with creatures lifestyles or just leave them be). The third entry ignores this and basically makes it a big action romp of silly humans being eaten by big dinosaurs. Instead of Steven Spielberg directing, we have his friend Joe Johnston(director of Jumanji and Honey, I Shrunk the Kids).    While parasailing, Eric and his mom's boyfriend are parasailing too close to Isla Sorna, Site B from the 2nd film. They end up being stranded on the island. Eric's parents want to find him but the US Embassy and the Costa Rican governement don't want to help so they enlist Alan Grant, main character from film 1 and his protege Billy. They also bring along 3 mercenaries. They end up crashing on the island and being chased by the Spinosaurus, described as the single largest predator in known history. Not to mention pteryadons and velociraptors.    Despite the CG enhancements, 3 actually has very cheap looking dinos. During a big dino fight in the first half, the dinos come close to the camera and it's obvious CG. There's many shots like that in here. Even though based on recently discovered fossils, the velociraptors actually look tamer here. In the first one, they were fast, big and threatening like you didn't want to cross them. Here they seem like just big lizards.    There is plot holes yes. Someone mentioned the airfield which wasn't in the Lost World. The windows on the car are in the wrong place. There was even supposed to be a gate/fence at the entrance which is missing. The Spinosaurus is never seen or heard in part 2, nor the raptor's ability to vocalize/coordinate. And the birdcage is never seen in 2. In the other ones raptors just snarled, hissed and roared and were downright terrifying. Kind of hard to get scared by things that bark like seals on here. Plus, the food they're eating, is it not over 4years old?    Despite the more action-y tilt storywise, oddly enough it isn't even gory or menacing. In part 1 you had a man being attacked onscreen, 2 actually but they were obscured, a man being partially bit and waved around, even an arm. Part 2 you get a guy being squished, torn in half and another being eaten but obscured(the video store guy). Here? One gets eaten but the foot obscures the bite, one gets snatched but that's it and another gets his neck snapped. The dinos don't even bother eating, just snap! Even the dialogue \\"I think this was Gennaro...I think this was too\\" is more gory than anything here.    However, it's still an entertaining B movie despite the fact it isn't suspenseful as the other 2. No T-Rexes outside tents or raptors in the kitchen here. But for a romp, can't go wrong. P.S to the guy who thinks Jeff Goldblum is in this: it's Sam Neill, not Jeff.
B0002F6BRE|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for Elf a little more than six months ago, I immediately jumped to the conclusion that it would be yet another Christmas movie rehash, with elves, Santa Clause, and snow to draw its audience. But to my surprise, when I first saw Elf, I was more quickly drawn back in awe than let down. It's totally different than what I was expecting. Yes, it has elves, Santa Clause, and snow in it. But it's not the same as everything else you may have seen this holiday season. Elf is it's own movie. Not confined to the age-old tradition like a lot of other films.<br /><br />First of all, the acting is simply top-notch and superb to the max. There can be no denying that. Will Ferrell is, without a doubt, on the top of his game in Elf. He displays all the signs of a good, up-and-coming actor. As if his comedian skills were not grand enough, now it looks like he is set on outdoing himself with acting. While some of his previous movies have done nothing but upset me, this one definitely made up for all of those. Then there is James Caan, who plays the role of Buddy's (Will Ferrell) father. As a grumpy, miserable old man, Caan churns out a good performance, and his change in attitude toward the end of Elf leaves the movie on a touching note. Not to forget the supporting cast, however. Bob Newhart (Papa Elf) and Zooey Deschanel (Buddy's \\"interest\\") both do their thing, especially Zooey who's character I really liked.<br /><br />Christmas movies tend to be quite like one another. But something in Elf sticks out and makes it a whole different movie. I'm not sure if it was Ferrell eating candy and syrup-covered spaghetti, the snowball fight that ensued in between, or the epic ending that featured Santa Clause escaping from the media, but Elf just clicked with me.<br /><br />As for complaints about Elf, I have but a couple that I'd have to say narrowly took away from the film. First and foremost is the predictability of it all. The ending is all too obvious; it wouldn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that everyone would leave happy, and Santa Clause would race off into the night sky shouting \\"ho ho ho\\". Nor was it too hard to guess that James Caan would come around sooner than later. Again, quite predictable. Also, the ending bugged me. I didn't like the angle of the media chasing Santa Clause. Up until the end, though, Elf was nearly flawless But these two flaws don't hurt the score of Elf too much.<br /><br />So if you're looking for one good holiday film this Christmas, look no further than Elf. I overlooked it from the beginning... heck, you probably will too. But give it a try. I promise you, it will definitely be worth your time!it wouldn't take a brain surgeon to figure out that everyone would leave happy, and Santa Clause would race off into the night sky shouting \\"ho ho ho\\".

B0000AMRJC|5.0|Gangster fan or not, I think there's a little something for every red-blooded American in this flick, Scarface. Trying to think of just one word to describe Scarface is nearly impossible to manage. Controversial, incredible, violent, vulgar, upsetting... all too often does all of this contribute to a classic gangster movie. But Scarface pushes the envelope and brings a whole new meaning to it all.<br /><br />Every scene in this film is drenched in style - - whether it's blood-stained Little Havana t-shirt's worn by leading man \\"Tony Montoya\\" (played by Al Pacino), the Miami, Florida backdrop, or the seedy attitude of the characters in general. The acting in Scarface couldn't have been more perfectly casted, either. The legendary Al Pacino leads the gang, and he certainly leaves his mark. While the Cuban accent needs a bit more work, just about everything Pacino brought to the table was spectacular. He's one of the key reasons why people still know the name of Tony Montoya. Any other actor casted for the role would have likely been forgotten sooner or later... but not Pacino's Montoya. Steven Bauer acts as Pacino's right-hand man and best friend in Scarface, as \\"Manolo\\". The chemistry between these two is excellent. Bauer was practically a nobody before he came along in Scarface, which is somewhat surprising considering he comes off looking like top-notch talent with this role. Michelle Pfeiffer plays the role of Montoya's wife, and while not as easy on the eyes as in future flicks, Pfeiffer puts on a pretty good performance. Much like Bauer, she was also an upcoming actor before landing in Scarface. Little did anyone know that in ten short years she would be one of the premiere female actresses in America.<br /><br />Scarface's story is anything but brilliant, but it's definitely not two-dimensional. It's actually quite simple. In the early 80's, Cuban leader Fidel Castro made many Cubans leave their homeland for America. Out of the 125,000 that he sent, approximately 25,000 of them had some kind of criminal record. Among the 25,000 was Tony Montoya. Along with his friend Camolo, Montoya makes a few big hits and gets involved with some major Miami crime lords. In doing this, he goes from being broke to being a very wealthy, successful hit-man. So in short, it's your typical from rags to riches story.<br /><br />Even 25 years after it's unveiling, Scarface still manages to stand the test of time. I just recently watched it over, and I must say that the stuff I found to be daring and controversial years ago still remain daring and controversial today. The acting is superb and well-casted, the action and violence keep the movie going, and everything in between just adds up even further. In the end, Scarface is possibly the greatest gangster film of all time. No exaggeration required. This is a must-see for fans of The Godfather, Casino, Public Enemy, Little Caesar, or the 1932 Scarface!mately 25,000 of them had some kind of criminal record. Among the 25,000 was Tony Montoya.

In the end, Scarface is possibly the greatest gangster film of all time. No exaggeration required. This is a must-see for fans of The Godfather, Casino, Public Enemy, Little Caesar, or the 1932 Scarface!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is a laugh out loud, fantastic comedy! The characters are rich and interesting and the movie is a delight. It's one of the funniest movies of the year. Although there are scenes of graphic violence, I think it is an integral part of the movie. Shaun of the Dead will go down as a classic among zombie movies.
B0000AMRJC|2.0|I must be that one guy in America that didn't like this movie. I guess this just wasn't my style or something, I just don't see what's so fascinating about it, this was *barely entertaining, let alone one of the greatest achievements in cinema history.<br /><br />It's about a guy that came from nothing, and goes on to become a drug lord. Pretty simple way to describe an entire movie, and that's exactly my feeling about the entire movie. Contrary to what a lot of people think, just because a movie is about mafias/drug trade/criminal groups doesn't automatically make it a great movie, don't forget good storytelling.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This is absolutely the best show I have ever watched in my life. its suspenseful, funny, fun to watch nd theres even a bit of teen drama thrown in. I absolutely love this show. I used to count down from the day after a new episode by hours until the next new episode. This show had me in a trance. I was so obsessed. And I still am. Theres no way I am NOT going to get the season DVD. This show is absolutely amazing. Its not getting enough credit, though, so I strongly advise that you watch this show. Trust me, you will enjoy it.
B0002X314C|5.0|What can I say......I love this album. <br /> <br />I left my radio playing all night, a few days ago, and woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of \\"So High\\". So beautiful....I felt that song. Mr. Legend is great!!!
0767019954|5.0|In a nutshell, you will find this version far more satisfying than the recent Reese Witherspoon version.  All the characters/actors here are more memorable and delightful, ribald and wicked. Natasha Little is very attractive as is Nate Parker.  Check your local library for both versions and compare (I say this being a good Amazon customer).  Picture the difference between Alex Kingston's rendering of Moll Flanders in comparison to Robin Wright Penn's, for example.
B000002TQV|5.0|this is my first radiohead album and my first step into the world and mind of radiohead and into the fan base that is super anti- everything but radiohead- and i see why, and i should have found the Bends much sooner than i did. but for the record there is no good and bad with radiohead. this is what makes amazing musicians and this is the fundamantal ingredient that bonds amazing musicians into  an amazing, inspirational and beyond-its-time band. and with radiohead there is no good and bad; there is only love and hate. and this is made absolutely evident from every review ever written about radiohead. take a look! for every review for this album on amazon, there is only five stars and one stars. there is rarely anything that constitutes as in-between. and that is why radiohead is a phenomenal and beyond its time band that everyone needs to discover even if they don't love it,  b/c that won't matter, because i do.
1932100385|5.0|Seldom does a book so completely trounce its naysayers. The China Study conclusively demonstrates the link between nutrition and heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. The undeniable truth is that the aptly named \\"diseases of affluence\\", the chronic and degenerative diseases common in Western cultures, are simply not found in populations whose diet comprises mostly whole, plant-based foods. In addition, when individuals abandon their traditional plant-based diets and embrace a Westernized diet instead  they suffer these chronic diseases at the same rate as those of us living in first world countries do.    The claim that data was left out of the book, and selective conclusions were drawn is ludicrous. If the entire text of the scientific papers, all the raw data, and every reference were included in this book  it would be the size of a house. The China Study was written in an engaging, understandable style for the lay public, not for fellow scientists/researchers/nutritionists/PhDs (although they would do well to pay attention) who have access to the complete references. The China Study is an overview, with the most important findings highlighted. For example, it shows that Professor Campbell and his researchers were able to turn the growth of cancerous tumors on and off simply by altering the nutrients fed to the test animals. In the laboratory setting and in human observation trials  The China Study has conclusively shown that animal protein is in effect  cancer fertilizer.    Those giving negative reviews would have you believe that Professor Campbell's research is flawed or biased. Nothing could be further from the truth. T. Colin Campbell, PhD. is a highly respected researcher whose decades of sterling, meticulously peer-reviewed work have been published in respected scientific journals worldwide. He is Professor Emeritus of the Division of Nutritional Sciences at the world-renowned Cornell University. For the record, he has offered to debate his critics and to date he has no takers. This is most likely because these impeccable credentials can certainly NOT be claimed for the myriad fad diet books, junk science websites, and dubious \\"foundations\\" out there. These would have you believe that you can continue chowing down on westernized junk and still be slim and healthy. Not true, people! Look around you!    By contrast to some self-professed diet experts  Professor Campbell  at age 70  is healthy, slim, and fit. He practices what he preaches. He eats a mostly vegan diet and runs 6-8 miles a day.    Professor Campbell does not claim that you must be 100% vegan ... instead he shows conclusively that the closer you trend toward that ideal ... the better your health will be. He lists basic dietary guidelines that are simplicity itself to follow.     Because the, albeit extremely rare, consequences of vitamin B-12 deficiency are so devastating and so simple to prevent using supplements ... he errs on the side of caution and wisely suggests that those concerned should take a supplement.     There is a lot of confusion about vitamin B-12; many use it as justification for a meat/dairy-based diet, so I would like to comment on this. Cobalamin (B-12s scientific name) is created by one-celled organisms: bacteria and fungi. These microscopic organisms are all over the place - in earth, wind, rainwater, and oceans. B-12 is stored in the body parts of animals that eat these bacteria; when an animal consumes particles of soil or manure along with grass or feed, B-12 producing bacteria are consumed   and the vitamin ends up in the flesh or milk from these animals. It is no more naturally inherent in their flesh and fluids than it is in our own. Our modern human world is sterilized because of an irrational fear of germs, whereas once people consumed trillions of helpful B-12 producing-organisms daily. Today everything is sanitized by hand-washing with antimicrobial soaps, antiseptics, antibiotics, antisepticmouth washes, and harsh chemical cleaning agents. To compensate, we must add back B-12. However it is not imperative that we consume animal products in order to do so.     For more information on this subject, I recommend \\"Becoming Vegan: The Complete Guide to Adopting A Healthy Plant-Based Diet\\" by Brenda Davis, R.D. & Vesanto Melina, M.S., R.D., or this excellent online article by Jo Stepaniak [...]    Read The China Study, check the facts and judge for yourself! Your body will thank you!
B000003CKH|4.0|yes, cake does have some bad songs, and yes cake does redo many older songs, and yes cake does kick some major buttocks' in the long run that is. but as many cake albums are, this is interesting funny and yes, cake still does sound as good as they always have. i will survive sounds much better with an amazing walking bass line- making this so much more fun (but sorry to say, credit where credit is due- the original was better). nugget, the distance and ya-yas make this cd a memorable and one-of-an-amazing-kind cake album. and yes it hangs from my rear view mirror- like testicles that is...
B00005JNSK|5.0|We had a great laugh. This movie is fun for the whole family. <br />It reminded us of the wizard of Oz in its photography (colors) and its decors, and the songs. We really loved it. We often laught out loud. <br />It was so amusing and very much in the spirit of the book which we adore. We relaxed and forgot all about the reality for a little moment of entertainment. And that is so great when it happens.
B00005ABIP|5.0|yes! the definition of cake-tasty, delicious, goes down easy, and sounds good anywhere. and this album is who and what cake is... retro style college rock with some a cherry on top. mmm ...cake. the best song on this album has to be satan is my motor however cool blue reason is a terribly slow and awful song but alas the rest makes up for it.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|Out of all the crap Horror/Thriller movies that have come out in the past year or so this is the only one I really cared for. Decent acting and a decent story as well, here lately it has been none of the above mentioned in horror movies. Definately worth checking out and it has a good ending as well.
B00005N9CV|2.0|Diana Krall's \\"When I Look in Your Eyes\\" was a great album which should have won the Grammy for Best Album of the Year. But Santana got the sentimental vote that year. (I digressed.) This album is boring and dull...put me right into a stupor. Every cut sounds the same....sloooowwwwwwwww and lifeless. She sounds like she was on downers when she made the recording. With the exception of the first song 'SWONDERFUL and the title song, everything else is forgettable mush.
6305313687|5.0|I'm not going to talk about the characters and the story but this is a must see. After seeing Edward Norton in Primal Fear and this I realized that this actor is one to keep an eye on. great acting from everyone and a great story, definately worth having.
B000002UAU|4.0|This album obviously deserves 5 stars.  While not quite as good as Revolver or Rubber Soul, it is still one of the best Beatles albums and nothing short of a masterpiece.  The reason i give this 4 stars instead of 5 isn't even the Beatles' fault, it's the fault of every musically-ignorant critic or fan that has called this the first and/or greatest concept album.  First of all, there is barely enough cohesion within this album to even classify it as conceptual, only 1 song in 2 parts even suggests the concept of an alter-ego band writing and playing all of the songs therein.  And even if this to be considered a concept album, it cannot be considered the first of its kind.  Paul McCartney, who played the biggest role in the creation of Sgt. Pepper's, claimed that he was in fact inspired by Freak Out! by Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention to do so.  This album was released a full year before Sgt. Pepper's and has a much more tangible concept.  Lastly, there is no way that this is the greatest concept album of all time.  There are at least 2 Mothers of Invention albums, 4 Pink Floyd albums, 2 Jethro Tull albums, and 2 Who albums that are better concept albums, even if they are not better albums in general.  All in all, a phenomenal, groundbreaking album that has fallen victim to some repulsive misinterpretation.
B0001Z53AQ|4.0|This LP was aite. D12 can rap and can work well together but lyrically, the tracks ain't phat. The tracks are entertaining but they don't convey any real, reflective messages. Most of da Trackz feature topics like crew loyalty, bling, hood violence, etc in em. Slim could have done betta but his rhymes are witty enough to make you enjoy listening. Kon Artis and Kuniva make a gr8 pair and Bizarre is just crazy but funny when it comes to his verses and tracks(Just like u). Proof delivers his lyrics well with that raspy voice and Swifty is also hot on tracks. Overall, this album is just aite but not that gr8. It appeals more 2 Shady fans than to serious, hardcore rap fans. I would have given this LP 3stars but with Em in it, this album deserves at least 4 stars. <br /> <br />Hot tracks: <br />1. 40 oz <br />2. Good die young <br />3. American psycho <br />4. Loyalty <br />5. Git up
B00005JNDZ|2.0|...just like Hugh Grant as Daniel Cleaver says to Bridget at one point in the movie.    <br /> <br />And this makes this movie hard to watch in many places.  Bridget Jones was supposed to be sort of like an Everywoman, someone who other women could identify with who have bad days at work, bad hair days, aren't the perfect weight,  and have been in bad relationships.  But the writers and director just made her ridiculous in this one. <br /> <br />Renee Zellwegger is as good as she is in the first movie, but she's given a crummy script in my opinion.  The relationshipship between her and Mark Darcy doesn't make any sense at all here, at least not nearly as much as it did in the first movie. They have absolutely nothing in common, despite supposedly  having grown up in the same neighborhood.    Colin Firth is gorgeous to look at as always, but the Mark Darcy character is so, well, haughty .  I realize he's based on Mr. Darcy in \\"Pride and Prejudice', but in the book he at least displayed some humor sometimes, as he did in the first movie in the cooking scene.  <br /> <br />In this movie he barely cracks a smile, though who can blame him when Bridget keeps doing embarrassing things whenever they're together.  Honestly, it seems as if the people that made the film wanted to make her character a total figure of fun.  Parts of it were actually cringe-producing.
B0000029DD|5.0|I'm not going to pen a verbose endorsement of \\"Grace\\".  There are many reviews on this site that already go into great detail about what an incredible talent Jeff Buckley was. <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that \\"Grace\\" is, in my opinion, the most beautiful collection of songs ever made.  Period.  Each song is a passionate, crafted masterpiece that still moves me deeply. <br /> <br />Rest well, Jeff.  (I often imagine you in Heaven with your guitar, singing your lovely, haunting songs to the One who gave you your incredible talent in the first place.)   <br /> <br />Thank you for leaving us with your music to remember you by.  Peace.
B00020X88O|5.0|To start, I just don't know why so many people down-grade this film. I absolutely love this movie and I've watched it more times than I can say. And just to make this known, I am NOT (and I repeat), I AM NOT BEING SARCASTIC WITH ANY OF THE REMARKS I MAKE ABOUT THIS FILM. <br /> <br />Paul Verhoeven is, without a doubt, an excellent director. In fact, he made three of my favorite movies: Total Recall, Basic Instinct and the movie I'm reviewing now, Showgirls. <br /> <br />Showgirls stars Gina Gershon, one of my favorite actresses. She is, in my opinion, one of the most sexiest and talented women in showbiz (and rock n' roll) today. Her performance is one of the greatest things about Showgirls. Whenever she's onscreen, she dominates it in its entirety. No one else could have played the part of Cristal Connors. <br /> <br />Showgirls also stars Elizabeth Berkley (the lead role) and Kyle Maclachlan. This may come as a shock to most who read this, but there was no miscast. Yes, Elizabeth fit the role. She's beautiful with alot of energy and charisma. She did fall in some parts , but she REALLY tried. Everyone out there has potential, they just need to find it. Berkley is fun to watch and she shines in every scene. She deserves a lot more credit. For those out there who really beat her performance into the ground, shame on you. <br /> <br />Showgirls's other star is Kyle Maclachlan, best known for his great performance in the American masterpiece Blue Velvet. Here he takes the 'bad guy' role of Zack. Maclachlan puts forth a very good performance, but it certainly can't beat his Blue Velvet role. <br /> <br />The storyline was great thanks to Joe Eszterhas, who also wrote the script for 1992's brilliant smash, Basic Instinct. The movie's shows put on at the Stardust were simply breath-taking and vivid. Definitely something that can be watched over and over. <br /> <br />When the Showgirls V.I.P. editon was released, I went out and bought it. The box is cramed with a lot oflittle goodies but I really wish that a few more features could have been put on the DVD. I wanted to shoot David Schmader for his rude and disrespectful commentary that was included on the new edition. Instead, I would have very much rather appreciated a commentary by Paul Verhoeven or Joe Eszterhas. Too bad, I guess. <br /> <br />Overall, enjoy Showgirls. It's pure classic all the way.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Plain and simple.  I'm not gonna write an extremely extravagent boast on this album.  It's just good.  Everyone that bashes music half the time can't play an instrument for the life of them.  If you listen to Avenged Sevenfold, regardless of any album because as they got older, musically they matured and gained more experience.  All their music is precise and on key, though their album may be different from Waking the Fallen.  Waking the Fallen was an AMAZING album and so is this one.  This just has a different sound.  Just because a band does not stick to one \\"sound\\" does not mean they are a \\"sell-out\\" or using a \\"stale-genre\\".  To whoever posted those posts before, do me a favor, you play some A7X and then come find me.  Until then, let music live and help support your local music scene.  Do not like people's ignorance stop you from pursuing your dreams
B0002WYS6S|5.0|I have heard a bit of Petrucci with Liquid Tension Experiment and G3, but was not prepared to be so blown away with this band. If you could combine the DNA of Rammstein and Yes this is what you would get. Power chords in combination with incredible musical talent. All of the musicians are on a different level, but the chops traded between Petrucci and his keyboard player are jaw-dropping. How these guys can pull up these long passages in synch is a monument to long-term memory. <br /> <br />Definitely buying more of this band.

You bang on the glass with scattered practice habits, but nobody hears you...\\" Kenny Werner writes, \\"Fear of not becomming great has kept you from becoming great. To find a way out this dilemma, a thorough reprogramming of your mind is necessary.\\" page 63 <br /> <br />It is in this passage a big flaw in Mr. Werner's teaching is revealed. He relies heavely on beating down his reader, by telling them what their problems are, so that he can take the liberty of building them up. No responsible teacher would ever do this so deliberately. <br /> <br />Generalities are grandiose ideas that hold no substance. This book is full of them: abstract things that can mean anything to anybody. Some people will truly enjoy it, others will be offended. Moreover it is easy to simply tell someone what to do:  <br />the sad truth is that what he propses \\"effortless mastery\\"  <br />does not really exist and nobody gets a free ride in music. <br /> <br />Kenny Werner had to find his own path to success as he says so himself through real-life experience. Before you add more to his success by giving him your money; I reccomend going to a library and do more \\"real-life,\\" insightful research. Talk to people you know, go to a University, find teachers and ask questions. An overnight solution will appear and dissapear with as much heartbreak as it is received enthusiasm.  <br /> <br /> <br />signed,  <br />a fellow pianist
B0007GAERG|4.0|This is a good album but not great.  Don't get me wrong, I like this album and I think Mariah is still one of a kind.  It's not excellent, although.   <br /> <br />However, I'll give Mariah Carey her credit.  I'm so glad she rose above all the negative energy that she was facing. Go, Mariah.   <br /> <br />She isn't number 1 for nothing.
0385335482|5.0|I first purchased the books in the Shopaholic series, because I myself am accused of being a shopaholic.  Well, I do not even compare to the character in this book, Rebecca Bloomwood.  In this book, she attempts to conquer her spending urges and get herself financially stable.  She ends up learning a lot more about herself and life than she had expected.  This is a fast read that will have you laughing out loud.  My husband kept asking what was so funny.  I am sure you will enjoy it!
B00005JNJT|5.0|I know that a lot of people think that the Tim Burton Batman movies are masterpieces, but I didn't like them.  And it is true that Batman and Robin was pretty stupid and hackneyed.  I basically thought that the Batman series was dead, but then Batman Begins provided a fresh outlook on the whole Batman concept. <br /> <br />This movie tells the origin of Batman, a subject that no previous Batman movie had whole-heartedly attempted to do.  In the movie, a young Bruce Wayne falls down a well and is frightened by bats, establishing a chronic phoebia.  His fear of bats leads him to persuade his parents to exit an opera that they are attending featuring bat-like costumes.  Tragically, Bruce witnesses his parents being mugged and shot to death in the alley outside the theater and blames himself for their deaths.  Their killer is caught and imprisoned but Bruce cannot allay his angust.  Several years later he travels to Asia to understand the criminal mind.  There he meets Ducard, who trains him to control his fear and anger.  Bruce takes these skills back to Gotham and becomes Batman.  And in Gotham, he finds that he really has his work cut out for him.... <br /> <br />I thought that the actors in this movie were well cast.  Christian Bale carefully balances Batman as a strong hero who has dark inner troubles.  His Bruce Wayne is young, consequential, and above all a inheritor of the powerful Wayne name.  Katie Holmes was also fitting as Rachael, a childhood friend of Bruce's and a future love interest.  She was at times a damsel in distress, yet still a firmly grounded force to be reckoned with.  Liam Neison was great as the mysterious mentor Ducard, and Morgan Freeman (Fox) and Michael Caine (Alfred) both served as perfect father figures for Bruce. <br /> <br />Finally, the plot was one of the best that I have seen in a Batman movie.  The main motiff of the movie is fear.  Batman learns to use fear to his advantage, while others fall victim to the Scarcrow's hallucingenic toxin that causes them to be tortured by their personal demons.  The villians in the movie are well characterized and conduct their devious plans with the uptmost guile.  As the movie progress, the viewers sees Batman's accretion as a hero and will be routing for him to win in the end.  This is an action packed movie with a get hero and even a more austere yet still powerful Batmobile. <br /> <br />This movie ends by adumbrating that sequels are in the works.  I sure hope that this is true because if Batman has such a promising begining, I can't wait to see where the journey will take him, even if future movies involve re-inventing characters that are present in existing Batman movies.  Let's hope that Batman's legend will continue for years to come.
0385336810|5.0|I loved this book.  It was light, funny, and sooo could actually happen.  I felt the embarassment as Emma stepped into one awkard situation after another.  It all started with a simple plane ride...except it wasn't simple to Emma.  She ends up thinking the plane is going to crash and rambles on and on to a strange man sitting next to her.  The plane didn't crash, and she never thinks she will see the man again....wrong!  He ends up being the founder of the company she works for!  Now he knows all her \\"secrets\\"...all the little things she does and doesn't do at work, etc.  Read to find out what happens to her job, and her relationship with this \\"stranger\\".  You will enjoy it, I'm sure!
0790730960|1.0|With the same director, leading actor, and screen-writer, I would think that Batman Returns would be just as bad as the original.  But I was wrong.  It is much worse.  Keaton continues his terrible portrayal of Batman, and is now joined by equally bad roles played by Danny DeVito and Christopher Walken. <br /> <br />The plot of this movie is that the Penguin was abandoned at birth by his parents because of his, well penguin-like apparence.  By black-mailing Christopher Walken, a powerful businessman, the Penguin wins the favor of Gotham and even runs for mayor all the while playing on the credulenc of the citizens.  Oh yeah, Catwomen also seeks revenge on Walken's character for pushing her out of a window.  Unfortunately, Catwoman does not fit well into this already convoluted plot and makes even less sense why she forms a brief alliance with The Penguin to try to get rid of Batman.  And it is disguisting hearding about The Penguin's preverted proclivities regarding Catwoman.  There is probably too much plot in this movie and not enough action; and the plot is acriminous. <br /> <br />This movie really only needed one good villian, but instead it got three sub-par ones.  DeVito looks morticious with pale skin and stringy hair, and he walks around in soiled clothes and eats raw fish.  Catwomen is little more than a vengence seeker and a lackluster love interest for Batman.  Walken is the real puppet master in this movie, but he really isn't that interesting.  Why create a normal villian for Batman when there are already two of this arch-rivials in the movie?  The reason is poor script-writting. <br /> <br />The only good thing about this movie is that it signaled the end of the Burton/Keaton Batman era.  The next two movies were not that great, but at least Batman Forever had likeable villians and more action.  Batman and Robin was worse, but it still wasn't as bad as the first two Batman movies.  The new Batman Begins is the best one yet.  Hopefully, it will redem the series and I even think that future movies that re-wrote storylines involving the Joker and The Penguin would be better than Batman and Batman Returns.
B000005RY7|4.0|Back in the day, Killers was one of the prizes of a KISS fan's record collection.  It was a greatest hits album that was released in 1982 after Music From the Elder and before Creatures of the Night.  It was released only in Europe, Australia, and Japan.   The Killers released in Germany has the backward Zs instead of the lightning bolts in the KISS logo.  The lightning bolts resembled the Nazi SS (Stormtroopers) insignia which is banned in Germany. It is an official great hits album (like Double Platinum) that is listed in KISS' official discography.  Way back when I considered it among KISS' other albums and the most rare because it was not released in the United States.  What makes Killers so desirable is that it offers four tracks not available on any other KISS album (I'm not sure if they were released on any recent box sets). There is some differences in information in the reviews here about the origin of these previously unreleased tracks.  My Kisstory book states that the songs were made in a quick recording session especially for Killers.  The period between The Elder and Creatures of the Night was a challenging time for KISS.  The Elder (although brilliant) was not received well by critics or fans.  Ace was disgruntled and did not write or play on the new Killers tracks.     Of the old tracks, this is one of the few greatest hits packages that does not focus on the first album.  Usually KISS greatest hits compilations will have Deuce, Firehouse, Strutter, and maybe Black Diamond.  Killers only offers Cold Gin.  The other tracks are from Destroyer (Shout It Out Loud, Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder, thankfully, NO Beth), Love Gun (title track), Dynasty (Sure Know Something, I Was Made for Loving You), and a live version of Rock & Roll All Night.  It is nice to have the Dynasty singles on here as I really like that unappreciated album.  It had such a fresh KISS sound.    If you do not have the four extra tracks and are wondering if they are worth purchasing this CD, I believe they definitely are.  The Kisstory book does not mention from which album writing session they originated (it seems to imply they were written especially for Killers but that is not clearly stated).  They do not rock hard enough to sound like Creature of the Night era (Vinnie Cusano was a writer for the Creature sessions, and he did not pen any of the Killers tracks) and they are not sophisticated enough to make me think of Elder.  They sound closer to Dynasty/Unmasked era.  \\"I'm a Legend Tonight\\" has that glam feel.  It definitely would have fit well on Dynasty.  It is an awesome track; very catchy.  \\"Down on Your Knees\\" is the new track I like the least.  It is not particularly bad, it is just that the other three are so stellar and this one is just a straight-forward, AC/DC style rocker .  The best of the new tracks is \\"Nowhere to Run.\\"  By itself, it is worth the CD purchase.  It has an Unmasked sound and, in fact, would be the best song on Unmasked.  It reminds me of \\"Shandi\\" but a \\"Shandi\\" that rocks harder.  It has beautiful guitar work and Paul shows his vocal versatility by singing some beautiful soft verses.  \\"Partners in Crime\\" is another excellent track.  Like the others, it is very catchy.  I really like the melody leading up to the chorus.  This one is a more \\"manly\\" rocker than Legend and Nowhere.  Other versions of this album include the additional tracks \\"Shandi\\" and \\"Talk to Me\\" from Unmasked (Australian edition) and \\"Shandi\\" and \\"Escape From the Island,\\" the latter of which is an instrumental from Elder (Japanese edition).  Killers is a definite must-have for the KISS fans who do not have the four new tracks, especially fans of the Dynasty/Unmasked era.
0790729652|2.0|I'm tired of reading reviews praising Tim Burton's orignal Batman.  I saw the movie in 1989 when I was about six years old.  I was utterly confused by it but being a child, it was only natural because Batman was not a kid's movie in the least.  However, recently I re-watched the movie to see if adulthood would allow me to appreciate the movie any more.  It did not.  This is still a horrible movie and here is why.<br /><br />First off, Batman is barely characterized in this movie.  Batman has very little on-screen time.  Jack Nickolson's Joker is the real star of the movie and I'd say that probably Robert Wohl has as much screen time as Keaton as Batman and Bruce Wayne combine.  It is a serious flaw that a movie called Batman is so chary about showing its main character.<br /><br />Another major flaw is Michael Keaton's portrayal of Batman/Bruce Wayne.  In the comics Batman was supposed to be a stern yet basically law abiding, and Bruce Wayne is supposed to be a charasmatic millionaire who controls a powerful company.  MIchael Keaton does not display these characteristic at all.  Keaton is wimpy, soft-spoken and far from heroic looking.  He also has absolutely no onscreen chemistry with Kim Bassinger.  Even in the more romantic scenes in the movie the two seem to be at most having an ackward conversion in an elevator.  Michael Keaton just doesn't cut it as Batman.<br /><br />The final problem with the movie is its story which was written by Sam Hamm (seriously, that's his name) and the overall direction by Burton.  Joker's plot to poison Gotham is a good one but it gets side tracked too often.  I didn't think that the Joker's attempts to woe Vicky Vale were neccesarily, nor did I think that plots involving Vale and Robert Wohl character were needed.  This is supposed to be an action movie people!  It doesn't need scenes of the Joker running around blaring Prince music!  The majority of the actual action scenes in the movie only serve to make Batman look weaker, including one in which the Joker shoots down the Batwing with a single bullet.  How lame is that.<br /><br />People complain about the non-Burton Batman movies, but at least they were more like superhero movies should be, even if they were a bit flashy.  But seriously, I think that Batman Begins is the best Batman movie yet.  It is dark and forboding, yet still herioc in its depiction of Batman.  The original Batman, however, is just too baleful and has bad casting and a  bad story.  It really isn't as great as some people say it is.including one in which the Joker shoots down the Batwing with a single bullet.

B000009EOR|4.0|Back in the day, Killers was one of the prizes of a KISS fan's record collection.  It was a greatest hits album that was released in 1982 after Music From the Elder and before Creatures of the Night.  It was released only in Europe, Australia, and Japan.   The Killers released in Germany has the backward Zs instead of the lightning bolts in the KISS logo.  The lightning bolts resembled the Nazi SS (Stormtroopers) insignia which is banned in Germany. It is an official great hits album (like Double Platinum) that is listed in KISS' official discography.  Way back when I considered it among KISS' other albums and the most rare because it was not released in the United States.  What makes Killers so desirable is that it offers four tracks not available on any other KISS album (I'm not sure if they were released on any recent box sets). There is some differences in information in the reviews here about the origin of these previously unreleased tracks.  My Kisstory book states that the songs were made in a quick recording session especially for Killers.  The period between The Elder and Creatures of the Night was a challenging time for KISS.  The Elder (although brilliant) was not received well by critics or fans.  Ace was disgruntled and did not write or play on the new Killers tracks.  Vincent Cusano (Vinnie Vincent)  did the guitar work. Vincent, of course, would be in the band for the Creatures tour and Lick It Up before his ego got in the way. <br /> <br />Of the old tracks, this is one of the few greatest hits packages that does not focus on the first album.  Usually KISS greatest hits compilations will have Deuce, Firehouse, Strutter, and maybe Black Diamond.  Killers only offers Cold Gin.  The other tracks are from Destroyer (Shout It Out Loud, Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder, thankfully, NO Beth), Love Gun (title track), Dynasty (Sure Know Something, I Was Made for Loving You), and a live version of Rock & Roll All Night.  It is nice to have the Dynasty singleson here as I really like that unappreciated album.  It had such a fresh KISS sound. <br /> <br />If you do not have the four extra tracks and are wondering if they are worth purchasing this CD, I believe they definitely are.  The Kisstory book does not mention from which album writing session they originated (it seems to imply they were written especially for Killers but that is not clearly stated).  They do not rock hard enough to sound like Creature of the Night era (Vinnie Cusano was a writer for the Creature sessions, and he did not pen any of the Killers tracks) and they are not sophisticated enough to make me think of Elder.  They sound closer to Dynasty/Unmasked era.  \\"I'm a Legend Tonight\\" has that glam feel.  It definitely would have fit well on Dynasty.  It is an awesome track; very catchy.  \\"Down on Your Knees\\" is the new track I like the least.  It is not particularly bad, it is just that the other three are so stellar and this one is just a straight-forward, AC/DC style rocker .  The best of the new tracks is \\"Nowhere to Run.\\"  By itself, it is worth the CD purchase.  It has an Unmasked sound and, in fact, would be the best song on Unmasked.  It reminds me of \\"Shandi\\" but a \\"Shandi\\" that rocks harder.  It has beautiful guitar work and Paul shows his vocal versatility by singing some beautiful soft verses.  \\"Partners in Crime\\" is another excellent track.  Like the others, it is very catchy.  I really like the melody leading up to the chorus.  This one is a more \\"manly\\" rocker than Legend and Nowhere.  Other versions of this album include the additional tracks \\"Shandi\\" and \\"Talk to Me\\" from Unmasked (Australian edition) and \\"Shandi\\" and \\"Escape From the Island,\\" the latter of which is an instrumental from Elder (Japanese edition, which is this edition).  Killers is a definite must-have for the KISS fans who do not have the four new tracks, especially fans of the Dynasty/Unmasked era.
B000001GXB|5.0|I understand the controversy that surrounds some of Pollini's recordings of 19th century music.   He's known for being a bit clinical or emotionally aloof.   It's been said that his interpretive approach is often at odds with works that demand a more direct emotional involvement and \\"heart-on-sleeve\\" style from the performer.   If one compares some of his recordings of \\"Romantic\\" era piano literature with those done by much older (or earlier) artists, it's apparent that only people like Backhaus (sp?) seemed to share Pollini's affinity for Stravinsky's dictum:   \\"just play what's in the score, and the rest will speak for itself.\\"       Not surprising then, that this pianist excells so much in repertoire like Stravinsky, Prokofiev, and other 20th century composers, and even gives such music a powerful emotional pull that (arguably) exceeds what he's able to do with the Romantics.   Perhaps he's more comfortable with works of a certain unique complexity, compositions that already give so much detail through the score, that there's little more for the artist to add?   One of the few Romantics he's truly celebrated for playing has been Chopin, a composer who himself, was not a great lover of Romantic music (HIS heros were Bach and Mozart).   Pollini addresses that Chopin when he plays, the enigmatic, reserved, \\"unknowable\\" side of Chopin, the one who never gives all his secrets.   There too, Pollini hits his emotional stride, and merges well with works like the piano concertos, and other similar pieces.    So why Beethoven?   Why particulary the late piano sonatas?   How did one of the all-time interpreters of 20th century piano music come to record one of the most discussed and listened-to sets of these particular works in all recorded history?   Perhaps much of the answer lies in the very nature of these pieces, the last of their kind that Beethoven would ever write.    The old master by this time in his life had already written plenty of barnstormers like the sonata\\"Appassionata\\", the \\"Waldstein\\", the \\"Emperor Concerto\\", and other such works, as well as the quieter and more lyrical piano pieces like the \\"Pastoral\\" sonata and 4th concerto.   These compositions, for all their differences, are bound together by a singular emotional directness, a sense of the composer speaking to the listener \\"with both feet planted firmly on the ground\\".   This dialogue between Beethoven and the listener was to change radically by the time the last 5 sonatas (and quartets, incidently) were being written.   After a 5 year period of relatively little creative activity, and many turbulant personal changes, a very enigmatic, less earthbound creative voice emerges.   Gone are the trappings of his earlier style, with the narrative forms, and the 'epic' battles between darkness and light.   Even \\"melodies\\" and \\"main themes\\" are replaced a good deal of the time by improvisational-sounding sequences and shifting blocks of abstract line and harmony (particularly in the first movements of the E major and A flat sonatats, and in the transition between the 3rd and 4th movements of the \\"Hammerklavier\\").   Sonata form has been discarded in favor of fantasia, fugue, and theme-and-variation.   Even the parameters between some of the sonata movements themselves, have been blurred beyond recognition.   With all this, the dialogue has ended, and we are now simply overhearing the composer's thoughts.       So who better to traverse this maze of musical thought than Pollini?   Other pianists favored more by a couple of the other reviewers do indeed imbue their performances with a greater emotional directness, at least when the music grants the oppertunity.   However, when the music decides to shift into the abstract, and the lyrical moments give way to the more jagged, expressionistic episodes, some of these same celebrated artists seem-well...a bit lost.   Hearing Serkin, for instance, play the \\"Hammerklavier\\" makes me love his courage more than anything else.   Perhaps Schnabel, out of all the older pianists (even with his weaker chops) has the most success with it all.   But then again, Schnabel was also an atonalist composer who created some of the most fiendishly complex abstract music for piano of the early 20th century.    So again, who better to interpret this music than someone who has the sense of detail and insight (and grasp of the musically obtuse) of a Schnabel, but with the technique and command of phrase and color of...maybe Hofmann(?), and finally the emotional commitment of a Richter (another pianist who knew how to express with great intensity and reserve at the same time)?   There is not a single page of this music that he has not found a way to get inside of, and the stickier the passage, the more he seems to rise to the occasion in every way, and makes you \\"get it\\".   Far from being \\"dry\\", the interpretation, like the music itself speaks to the listener from beyond the realm of simple earthly passion, and even the pain in it seems as if filtered through a profound state of spiritual bliss.    Dry?   Clinical?   Not if Pollini is heard in just the right repertoire, and with completely open ears.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|Thirty years after it's debut, this watershed miniseries is still the best single documentary ever made about World War II. Expertly blending archival footage with eyewitness accounts of the participants themselves, a first rate soundtrack as well as a beautiful, haunting narration supplied by none other than Sir Laurence Olivier himself, well, you  simply have an unsurpassable combination. <br />American viewers might be put off by certain things. Yes, it does look like the British Army won the Battle of Normandy, and true it does say that the British came in from the north to put pressure on the Germans in the Battle of the Bulge (actual British participation in the Bulge was very small), and it does make it look like the British met the Russians before the Americans did. And the Pacific has only a handful of episodes as compared to Europe. Okay, with that said, I can only answer with, so what? This was a British production after all, and they have a right to be proud of their accomplishments as do we. Frankly, I enjoyed seeing the footage used correctly. You don't see 1940 German Army footage being advertised as 1944. The pacing is superb. Add to this that at least they tried to get all sides of the story. The Germans aren't painted to be the robotic fanatics as others have done and they strain for objectivity. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen this series. Rent it. If you've seen it, then buy it. This is the kind of excellence all documentaries should shoot for.
B00097DX3U|1.0|This album does not do chris cornell or members of Rage <br />any justice.. <br />ive been a listener of cornell from back in the day of fopp and mother love bone. <br />Both rage and cornell have more talent somewhere in there sleeve. <br />What I would like to see out  of \\"AudioSlave\\" is chris doing more guitar. <br />  He has some very interising chords and kick butt vocal to follow and <br /> Rage just needs to back him up with drum, bass and guitar. thats it! thats all they need to do. <br />Chris Cornell has always been top of the food chain with all his bands, <br />but in Exile with them all slurping on the same brew there slowly drowning. <br />
1401200605|5.0|<br />I'm going to tell you something you can bank on. When you see Jeph Loeb's name on a comic collection or comic book, you will not be disappointed.  This holds true with Hush, where Batman cuts through a multi-layered mystery to discover that his enemy is a friend from his past.  I've always thought that DC characters, especially Superman and Batman, were far superior to anything Marvel, but the comics always suffered from mediocre to poor artwork.  Jim Lee does for Batman what he did for X-Men-the girls are supermodels, the vehicles otherworldly, the scenery surreal.  Loeb gives the reader a good sweep of major Batman allies and villains, in a story that puzzles you to the very end. Hush has to be the most clever and manipulative Batman villain in quite some time.  Go ahead and pick this up. While you're at it, get Dark Victory and the Long Halloween. This is the stuff that inspired the wonderful resurrection that is Batman Begins.
B000A88F22|5.0|OMG I can't believe a DVD and a bonus CD is comming out ! I loved that show so much ! I'm a huge fan of Britney from Baby One More Time ! And it won't stop now ! I think I'll get like 3 set of that DVD ! LOL ! Everyone should get it ! It was an awesome show and Britney was hilarious ! Plus, it got scenes from The Onyx Hotel Tour, which I could'nt go ! So it was really cool ! And Kevin seems to be a really good guy, the show make me like him even more ! Yay to Britney!
B00000INKE|5.0|Layla is probably the best CD Eric Clapton has ever recorded. <br />This Cd is a very close second though. <br />Eric Clapton opens with Pretending which was a major hit for him at the time. <br />He then does Bad Love which had a video to go with it, another great song. <br />Running on Faith is next and to me is the \\"Gem\\" of this CD. <br />Clapton sings very solefully and this song is very well written. <br />Hard Times is next as he redoes the Ray Charles classic. <br />His guitar is as good as Ray's piano was on the original. <br />Next is Houndog and this is the original version, the way it appeared when it was done as a blues song before Elvis Presley recorded the song. <br />No Alibis is another great song. <br />Run so far is a duet with the late George Harrison and is a longer version of the song that appears on \\"Brainwashed\\". <br />Old Love is a song that Clapton and Cray did together with each doing their own verse. Clapton wrote the opening verse just in case you want to know. <br />There are two more songs and then the CD closes with a strong version of Before you Accuse me. <br />This CD is a must for any record collection much less Clapton fans..............It dont get any better than this
B0009MDPYM|1.0|I don't know much about the comic but regardless of it, it's still a really bad movie. Keanu Reeves is with out a doubt the worse actor we have around, giving a performance that kills this movie and kills a few brain cells along the way with hokey dialog and a story that goes no where. The only three actors who do make it out of the film with there dignity intact is Rachel Weisz, who I agree with almost everybody gives the films only great performance, Djmon Hounsou, who makes a more believable sorcerer than Keanu Reeves and Peter Stormare, who's brief appearance does more for the climax than the stupid gun fight that rips off The Matrix. <br /> <br />Too bad nether Weisz, Hounsou or Stormare could have saved this film, that's how bad Keanu and the rest of the movie is.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Reviews that attack Moore for playing loosely with facts are apparently from people who don't want to hear him.<br /><br />Moore documents everything in the film several times over. Much of the footage was assembled rather than shot by him, and speaks for itself.<br /><br />The detractors who regard his documenting of grief as exploitation must prefer emotions served up sanitized or hidden altogether. The film so convincingly records the administration's manipulative exploitation of people's feelings and fears, that I marvel how people who see it can still delude themselves into believing that it's OK for their government to wage genocidal war abroad and war against their own liberties at home.<br /><br />I suspect that many of them might have watched the film, but not seen it. Michael Moore holds himself to a standard of truth that is light years ahead of that of our government. I have no use for those who require perfection from him but have nary a qualm about the malignant deceitfulness of the monsters who are running this country.
0316172324|5.0|This book is even better than Tipping Point, Gladwell's prior book.  It's got lots of factual stories, research and anecdotes that make it interesting.  It'll surely make you think -- and think about how you're thinking.  You'll have plenty of tidbits for dinner party conversations after you read this one.
B000006TRV|3.0|So, everyones gonna look at this review funny after seeing that title. For me this album  is one of the most daring that floyd tried, and i think they slightly missed the mark. <br /> <br />My first point in case is this; there are far too many filler tracks. Songs like bring the boys back home, dont leave me now, the show must go on, etc etc. I dont get them. Its just atmospheric brooding sound that doesnt lead to anything. Give me echoes any day, at least the atmospheric trip out movement leads to an awesome dreamlike finale.dont get me wrong, songs like hey you, comfortably numb, young lust, waiting for the worms, all still send a shiver up my spine, and rightly so, but i still have trouble listening to this album all the way through. <br /> <br />Secondly, this is something floyd had never really done before; this entire album is VERY dark. I for one don't like it, but i can see it how it would be appreciated. In terms of lyrical content, it is the opposite side of the coin for dark side of the moon, which deals with society's problems and false standards, how its ok to question this sort fo thing, and that eventually the sun will be eclipsed by the moon. The wall deals with being abnormal and noticing these things, and the negative effects that are felt in this situation, such as alienation, loneliness, and the adoption of views that hold no human sympathy. Very cold lyrical content.Admittedly the album ends well though. But this dark brooding sound is heard throughout all the instruments for the whole album.  <br /> <br />Maybe this is one of their albums i just dont 'get', but for me the album is held back by the fact that it is a concept album. If it werent, a lot of the filler could be cut, and we would have a better overall album. On the other side of the argument, in losing the fillers, you lose half of the story of whats actually happening to Pink.This album is still well worth getting, anything floyd has written is well above the standards of anyone like them at the time, or now.I just advise getting some of their earlier stuff first, its better. Dark side of the moon, Meddle, Wish You Were Here, Animals, Atom Heart Mother, take your pick.But this one is an album that is just that little bit harder to warm up to. <br /> <br />P.S. if there was a half a star i could give this one, it would have had 3.5.
B00005JNSK|4.0|The young actor, Freddie Highmore, who portrayed Charlie Bucket could be the older brothre of Thomas Sangster in 'Entrusted' they look so much alike.  Johnny Depp was the perfect Willie Wonka.  This futuristically-done production was directed by Tim Burton.  This duo will have another collaboration out in a couple of months, an animated film which was previewed preceeding this feature.    A chocolate Taj Mahal was built in New Delhi but melted in the hot summer weather.  Recently I talked with a passenger on a local bus who said that he is from India and is used to the heat.    Charlie's Jewish grandfather, played by David Kelly, had worked in the chocolate factory fifteen years prior to children's 'day' for five lucky gold card holders.  He was anxious to see what was going on inside the place as workers were never seen entering or leaving, which created a mystery.    They discovered a fully robotic factory, the one I've dreamed of for twenty-five years now.  Eventually, the viewer learns why Willie Wonka loves candy -- in his flashbacks as the tortured son of the local dentist.  I do believe I saw Jeff Welch down on his knee in one scene.    The song and dance routines at important intervals were much fun to watch.  Danny Elfman did the vocals and Deep Roy was a cute little men who was duplicated into clones.  Willie was having his page-boy hair do trimmed, he said, when he was confronted with a long white hair.  Thus, he set out to find an heir.  It appeared that he was not attracted to women, so he couldn't go about it in the normal way.  His black rubber gloves were spooky.    His glass elevator was like a time machine, though it went 'up and out' of the tallest smokestack.  It was a miracle when Charlie had found the ten dollar bill and bought the last lucy candy bar.  He said that Willie Wonka wasn't as good as he appeared at first.  But, then when you get to know eccentric people better, they never are.  He was like Tiny Tim, the one who married Miss Vickie.When Charlie refused to give up his extended family, as families love you and try to protect you, to disappear into the chocolate factory, Willie had an 'in-house' psychiatrist who just sat and listened.  And he didn't charge $100 per session.  Charlie became a shoe shine boy, though his family prospered after his excursion through wonderland.  Shades of Michael Jackson!      This was not anything like the 1971 film, 'Willie Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,' which my sons enjoyed.  But it was different, and that makes it acceptable in these modern times.  It's good to be different, and anything Tim Burton does is always different.
B00006AUIG|4.0|I dont really give anything 4 1/2 stars but this is way deserving of it. Pure genious. This is one creepy horror movie. <br /> <br />I cant say enough good about this. I just rented this movie and didnt know what i was getting and what i was getting is definitly one of the best truly horrifying,creepy scary movies to ever be made. This movie is what horror is all about no humor just strictly horror. The atmosphere is creepy, the acting is great the plot is great the ending is spectacular with a great twist. The movie never slows down and never bores, basically has you on the edge of your seat. <br /> <br />I havent seen a movie that literally gave me the chills and creeped me out in, I cant say how long the along comes this.  I would with no question put this on the list with movies like the \\"Exorcist\\" and \\"The Shining\\". This is class A and you cant go wrong. When the movie ended  I was just basically amazed at what i saw and couldnt believe I saw a horror that was this great. I love horror but alot of these horror films like to throw in humor sometimes good some times boring, but in this movie, there is no humor just horror. I love a good serious horror no jokes at all horror movie and that is exactly what this is.  <br /> <br />Dont even bother renting just go buy it, its that good and youWONT BE DISSAPOINTED. <br /> <br />Whats really funny is there are so many movies out there undeserving of the price that they go for 15, 20, 25 $. Yet this film is being sold on amazon for $13 this movie could easily be going for $22 and I would with no question still buy it. Its a movie that will never get boring. I will go to a couple places looking for it tommorow, I juust want to buy it and have it and not wait . If I cant find it I wll order it off amazon. Dont deprive your self of a truly great horror movie.

B0002OERI0|5.0|This album was a gift to me for Xmas in '04, so I didn't immediately buy it once it hit stores in September of last year.  I first heard the single \\"American Idiot\\" on the airwaves, and didn't think much of it until I heard them bust out ALLLL those other singles ( Boulevard of Broken Dreams, Holiday, J.O.S., St. Jimmy).  Pretty much every song on here has the potential to become a hit, mainly because the local alternative/punk rock radio stations where I live play them ALL.  I'll be honest, I've been into alternative rock and punk since I was 9 years old ('94), and I've never had any grudges against Green Day because they are my ALL time fave. rock band and always will be for years to come( keep it up, guys!)  To say they have gone mainstream, become popular or sellouts, on that note, MIGHT be appropriate, but before this political epic masterpiece came out I always quoted them as \\"underrated\\".  Say what you will about this CD, recorded to resent the current leader in office, conversing about fascists and the government, telling the story of lost, \\"broken dreams\\", f--ked up relationships, the loss of a loved one ( hence Billie Joe's dad).  The list could go on forever.  Either way, the controversy spreads.  You have the ultimate choice of judging whether or not this CD is the best in your collection.  My ratings for each song are as follows:  American Idiot- 7.5/10  Jesus of Suburbia (including all the parts)- 10/10  Holiday- 9/10  Boulevard of Broken Dreams- 10/10  Are We The Waiting?- 10/10  St. Jimmy- 10/10  Give Me Novacane- 10/10  She's A Rebel- 9/10  Extraordinary Girl- 10/10  Letterbomb- 10/10  Wake Me Up When September Ends- 10/10  Homecoming (all parts)- 9.5/10  Whatsername- 10/10
B0006MT314|5.0|This has to be my favorite soundtrack yet! With music from the amazing Tyler Hilton and Gavin DeGraw just makes it 100 times better!!! Good songs are on here with a little bit of every music style!!! If you like the music on One Tree Hill....just get the CD!!
B000A6T1KE|5.0|Star Trek: Nemesis was met with fan and critic concernc.  Some say it was too close of a story line with Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.  But in all actuality Star Trek: Nemesis was a good movie and a good send off for the Next Generation crew.   <br /> <br />The movie was confronted with three major problems at its release... <br /> <br />1.) Hiring a director (Stuart Baird) who had no love/knowledge of the Star Trek franchise.  Stuart Baird was not a good choice for the direction of this film.  Jonathan Frakes, LeVar Burton or David Carson would have been a good choice to direct this film. <br /> <br />2.)Dec. 13 release date.  Released less than a week before Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers, Star Trek: Nemesis did not stand a chance at the box office.  Maid In Manhatten did well only because of the hipe over Jennifer Lopez and her relationship, which was about to explode, with Ben Afflack.  Harry Potter and Die Another Day were also two other movies that posed a threat to Nemesis. <br /> <br />3.) 50 minutes of deleted scenes hurt the film.  Even though some were deleted because it dragged the movie out some should have remained such as the scene between Picard and Data after the wedding, extended wedding sequence scenes and more indepth scenes with Shinzon. <br /> <br />All in all I give this Special Collectors Edition 5-stars because Nemesis is a good film (even though it has problems)and deserves to be given a second chance.  This is a must have DVD for any sci-fi/Star Trek fan.
0066214122|1.0|Not only does Crichton build classic, generic, one level personality types, but he also utilizes the same redundant formula he always does - man advances - man's advance gets out of control and threatens to do him in. In this case he uses nanotechnology as the \\"fearful antagonist\\" but he is not technically accurate, or even complete when describing his own pretend version of the technology. The scariest thing about Prey is not the plot (highly predictable) but rather that his portrayal might actually influence people into believing that this is the real nanotechnology of the future, and it is not. The nanotechnology of the future will have amazing benefits, cures for cancer, solutions for environmental issues and food for all (try a Google search). And while any emerging technology has it's cautionary side (remember when human jobs were predicted to be replaced with computers by 1985?). Crichton's tale is merely a fictional account, and a poor one at that.
B000002HRE|5.0|most metallica fans were in it only for the heavy ripping fast rhythms and screeching guitar solos.  so it's no wonder that this and Load got bad reviews.  i gave it a 5 but that don't mean i don't feel your pain.  coming out of the black album we all thought that that was their new sound slower, not much though, and more melodic.  but the Black Album had the same tunings and overdrive that we all loved.  we awaited for Black Album prt. 2 as we all at least went to two concerts in that time.  what did we get?  blues.  great blues though.  and where this wasn't good coming from metallica, it kicked the ass off any other active band at the time.  at first i wasn't impressed, but over time i became obsest with load and reload.  most fans claim there is no distinction between load and reload but there is a huge and i must say that reload impresses me more.  the guitar work like i said above is the sound of music critics shutting up and no longer having any thing to say about metallica's lack of melody.  with both albums but specifically and especially reload you get truly rock and roll licks that have as much emotion as a measure of eric claptons work on crossroads.  most hard core fans seemed mad at metallica for this musical change and for cutting their hair but onbehalf of metallica i say shut up and quit whining.  these albums sold very well and are very highly underrated.  the only problem is that they followed the black album which we were all expecting another.  kirk proves he isn't limited to fast shred guitar (although i always saw a more melodic and bluesy oriented style in that speed) and does a great job in what i believe from a lead guitarist's point of view his best lead work ever.  well i would always like the real metallica more but there is no denying these records as great.
0156421178|5.0|Lately, I have been thinking that God sent us a message during the last election - exposing the stinking hypocrisy of the loud-mouth, self-proclaimed superpatriot right-wing lunatics. They all sat on their pilodinal cysts during Vietnam and they have the unbridled shamefulness to trash the true patriotism of John Kerry - who volunteered. Compare that to Bush, using family connections to ditch his duty. <br /> <br />This has always been true. The self-proclaimed superpatriots always hide under the skirts of their mommies, while the steadier men fight to give them that safety.  <br /> <br />A few years ago, for my own amusement, I excerpted passages from three intellectuals - all left of center - describing their war experiences. One was by Oliver Wendell Holmes describing his wounding at Antietam (\\"in our youths, we were touched by fire\\"); another by Robert Graves (in GOODBYE TO ALL THAT) describing how he was triaged during one of the great battles of WWI as too near death to merit the effort to save him. He was left untreated for 27 hours. His description of a nurse giving him a drink of water is priceless. The last is, of course, Orwell's magnificent HOMAGE TO CATALONIA. Read his two page description of being struck by a bullet and marvel at the will of a man determined to hold shock at bay while he absorbed the experience! He was determined to record everything!
B0006L5RT2|5.0|Usually I buy good old fashioned 'Rock'. (In fact the day I bought this album I also bought QOTSA, Foo's and Aerosmith.) But of the four this is the one that is the most compelling. Beautiful, soulful and refreshingly honest lyrics combined with great hooks really draw the listener in.  It makes you want to listen to the words rather than just hear the album as background music. Not bad for an ex squaddy!! <br />
B00006LLNV|5.0|Lets all face it, big Frida fans like myself thought the movie was pretty shallow, that Selma Hayek was miscast, bared no physical resemblance and indeed, was too agile to convince us that this is a woman who really sufferd. An unknown Mexican actress would have had a greater effect one feels.But all that doesn't matter as the glorious soundtrack can be enjoyed as an entirely seperate entity. From folksongs to tangos and beautiful instrumentals using traditional instruments(gave me goosebumps). If you dont speak Spanish, there's no need to fret, as the translation is posted next to each song. About the translation itself, well...I grew up in Spain, went through the Spanish education system etc. I'm pretty fluent. Fluent enough to cringe at the the glaring errors in almost every line, there's also a verse missing from La Bruja and a couple of lines missing from Estrella Oscura. Also negro llorona is probably referring so a sorowfull widow, as in she is always dressed in black and cries all the time(una llorona). There was a girl in my class who cried all the time and was therefor dubbed la llorona(the cry-baby) for the rest of the year.I suggest you buy this soundtrack together with Frida: The Biography, which again has Selma's stupid face on the front. Fear not, it has nothing to do with the movie and was released years earlier. I personally am saving up my pennies to visit the Tate Modern in London, who are holding an exibition of her works until October. <br />Enjoy the soundtrack muchachos!
B0006L16N8|2.0|parachutes and rush of blood are fantastic albums. This album is a bad mixture of U2 and Radiohead. No songs really jump out at you. the albums lyrics are shallow and the music is very bland. This was the album that was supposed to take them to the next level. the only reason coldplay will sell more albums and concert tickets because of this record is all because of hype.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|A lot has been made about how this movie deviates from thesource material.  I can relate to this, because I have experienced the same frustration seeing similar movies (the Bourne Identity and its sequel are recent examples).  But I will judge this movie on its merits alone.   <br /> <br />The performance of Eric Bana I would say is the best of all.  His character had heart, and his fight scenes were among the best i have seen.  Orlando Bloom's performance was okay.  I disliked the character, but i guess he was playing for womanizing coward.   Sean Bean (as Odysseus) was well-played as well.  As did most of ther other actors.  Two exceptions were Diane Krueger and Brad Pitt.  Krueger (as Helen) was just flat and unbelievable.  Now Pitt, I think can be a pretty good actor.  I loved him in  Interview with the Vampire, Spy Game and his recent release Mr and Mrs Smith.  But here he is sadly miscast.  He was just unbelievably flat as Achilles.  While part of this was the dialogue he and the other actors had to work with, it is mostly a decent actor in a role ill-suited for his particular talent.  And since he is made the center of the movie, the movie suffers for it.   His dialogue is starchy, there is no chemistry with any of the characters he interacts with (Priam possibly excepted), and he has no emotional range at all.  I think the psychiatric term is blunt affect.   <br /> <br />The battle scenes were all well done and the highlight of the movie.
B0007OY2MG|3.0|The packaging of this dvd set is rather shoddy. It is not 1/2 as nice as the previous gilmore girls sets. The box is thinner, and to  cut space the plastic pages that hold the actual dvd has been made thinner, and clear. Also the binding of these pages to the box came apart within 5mins of my opening of the case; it is simply a clear sticker that connects the first disks to the last one. The last disk is the only one that is actually bound to the inner case. The show is still great but I wish they had not skimped on the packaging.
0140187537|5.0|I recommend this book for numerous reasons; a good story, a good reflection and Steinbeck is a genious with words.  This is a book written by a man with experience, one who has the ability to look backwards in his history and plumb the youth, to look forward into the mirror and see the inevitable changes time wroughts and to look future with hope and despair, in short Steinbeck's main character Ethan is a metaphor for the human condition and a glimpse into the man behind the words.
B00068IOWC|5.0|Whether you like loud music in the car or to do the housework to, this is the One, you can really boogie whilst hoovering etc. Can't help it, you have to try and sing the words to \\"Vertigo\\" (all wrong off course). \\"Miracle Drug\\" is a great tune, the guitars and keyboards have a fantasic sound. Track 3 is a bit slow tempo but at least you can have a go at hitting the high notes, just like Bono (not)! Very catchy album. I'm not into track 4 but track 5 \\"The City of Blinding lights\\" needs to be played at 10, volume not time. It got a haunting riff. The rest of the tracks are all catchy easy listening rock pop songs, very sing a long, feet tapping etc. Track 10..Original Of The Species could be covered by Robbie Williams, it's a bit in his style.  To sum up there is just one track I don't rate on a 12 track CD, the rest are 100% excellent. I'm not even a U2 fan (but the CD is now in my car, pinched off the other half and he ain't gonna get it back). GO BUY IT...listen to it, again and again...It's like a pair of shoes...get's more comfortable in time.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I am a big fan of the original movie however, this movie was more entertaining. Money well spent. I would see it over and over!!
B0002858YS|3.0|Brandon Flowers and his Killers start off \\"Hot Fuss\\" with a near-perfect opener, the synth-happy jam \\"Jenny Was A Friend of Mine.\\"  If the rest of the album could retain the fun had on this opening track with its chorus of \\"tell me what you want to know, oh come on, come on, come on, there is no reason for this crime, Jenny was a friend of mine\\", the album would be close to the same league as modern rock behemoths like The Stokes or Interpol.  <br />  <br />   Unfrotunately, after my personal favorite track \\"All These Things I've Done\\" (which should have been the phenom single \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is), the album quickly slips into mediocrity, as if The Killers secretly wished no listeners would get that far into their debut.  <br /> <br />   This is made even worse since the singles \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\", as well as Duran Duran-infused \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" are so catchy.  The rest of the album can't keep up with the tone established early, but it still leaves The Killers with some killer singles to stay afloat the 21st century new wave of rock.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I held off on getting this for quite some time. I ended up getting it because i lent my copy of the original to my brother and he kidnapped it. The commentary track on this version is much better than those on the original -- i thought Drew overly-dominated the cast commentary and i was somewhat annoyed by the Richard Kelly & Jake one, the director seemed overly concerned with explaining what the h&*^ was going on. This commentary is like that too, but Kevin Smith makes it MUCH less pretentious and clinical, much more organic. Aside from the commentary, the UK documentary and the #1 fan documentary are really interesting, the production diary less so.  <br /> <br />So, i view this set as all bonus features to be enjoyed by fans. The actual director's cut version of the movie, i dunno. The original is one of the best movies made. It's nice to see the added scenes where they should fit chronologically, but this version doesn't really seem necessary. Except that because of it we get all the extra features, which do enhance the experience, ALOT.
B00003CY0V|3.0|Early in the film, Travolta's character gives this little speech: <br /> <br />\\"You know what the problem with Hollywood is? They make sh*t. Unbelievable, unremarkable sh*t...I'm talking about the lack of realism. Realism. Not a pervasive element in today's modern American cinematic vision.\\" <br /> <br />After watching the additional material at the end of the movie it became perfectly clear that my assessment of the movie while watching it ('what a waste of celluloid') was on the money. The producer, commenting on the escape scene at the end, noted that they were trying to do something that no one else had done before in an ending.  <br /> <br />Wait 'til you see it.  How in God's name would criminals escape like that? Realism?  Spare me.  It makes for some fancy special effects (that are just a bit too reminiscent of The Matrix) but it's ridiculous, so ridiculous as to not even be entertaining.  <br /> <br />Perhaps the best thing about the movie was its premise. But once the film starts rolling, it just meanders about seeking to shock the viewer with fancy stunts and dialogue. And its attempt to 'better' Dog Day Afternoon was a laugh. <br /> <br />It's too high on its own sense of the spectacular and lacks substance. Travolta never quit gives the impression that he is as cool as he looks. Jackman's relationship with his daughter seems a bit contrived and Berry's role is pretty much as a prop. Don Cheadle is probably the best of the four on the box cover but the movie is a bit too puffed up on its own looks. <br /> <br />We never care about any of the characters, not even the hostages. The special effects have all been done before and are basically pointless, kind of like kids breaking things to get some attention. Obviously, I was really disappointed. I can't say it's a waste of time but there are better ways to spend two hours. <br /> <br />There is one redeeming feature about this film: the soundtrack.  That, and you get to see Halle Berry naked. <br />
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|I hang out with my brother because no one likes us, and sometimes we stay up all night and analyze movies. As usual, he's right. Nearly all successful childrens films, books, etc...have something to do with the supra-natural. Witchcraft usually. Mary Poppins is the nicest witch ever. She crafts order from chaos, turns brats into nice children, and turns real life into a happy cartoon. The songs are ageless, timeless, and charming. Mary Poppins is a very powerful witch indeed! I'm sure that children will be spellbound and unable to unglue thier little eyes from the screen. For older people like me, I am way impressed by the seamless special effect; for example, Mary's carpet bag that's deep enough to hold a 7' lamp, other furnishings too, but her bag is only about 14\\" deep. I think it would have made a good series watching Mary go from house to house in ancient England rescuing needy families. Engaging and lovely. A truly wonderful film!
B00005JNSK|5.0|i just saw it at my theater & I love this version more better than the orginal Gene Wilder version.  <br /> <br />      For yes it was more closer to the orginal book version than the Gene Wilder version. <br /> <br />    Especially when they showed that story of Prince Pondicherry from India & His Chocolate Palace. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00001OH7O|5.0|Without doubt Bowie's finest hour as a songwriter, Hunky Dory was - and remains - one of the best albums ever recorded.  Quintessentially English, the record features Bowie's plaintive voice (no effects here) layered over sparse instrumentation - mainly piano and guitar. <br /> <br />There's too many great songs to namecheck so it's probably easier to point out the poorer ones.  Let's see - Song For Bob Dylan is a little weak and some people find Fill Your Heart a bit much to take.  Erm... that's about it. <br /> <br />I've never met anyone who doesn't like this album... and I probably never will.  In a hundred years when they're reappraising 20th century music, this will be held up as an example of all that was good about it.
0316172324|2.0|What a bore! \\"Blink\\" is a grab bag of platitudes that leads absolutely nowhere. The core thesis is risible. The author basically argues that under the right conditions, humans make better decisions when they use their instincts. He then states that under the wrong conditions, decisions based on instinct can be disastrous. Jee-whizz, Malcom, thanks for the insight! The book is hype and empty of any valuable content; it will certainly become standard reading in MBA programs.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Just wanted to address something real quick: I read on amiannoying.com (great site, BTW) that Avril called her fans a bunch of losers for \\"copying her style\\". Yeah, real sharp, Avril. This is what its come to. To Avril, as long as the unwashed masses keep buying into her schlop, and she gets more millions coming in, she's fine. Talk about biting the hand that feeds. <br /> <br />Avril here, Ashlee Simpson, etc. not only are horrible \\"artists\\", but they obviously show absolute zero respect for their fans. This just makes me miss Dimebag Darrell (RIP) even more, because he obviously loved his fans so much. He would go back and party with them as if they were old friends. Now we have Avril Lavigne calling all the 13-year-old pre-teen girls buying into her junk \\"losers\\". (Actually, she may have a point...) <br /> <br />As for the music itself, or, more importantly, whether she's \\"punk\\" or not... related searches for \\"Avril Lavigne\\" include \\"Britney Spears\\". 'Nuff said.
B0000C83YJ|5.0|Out of all of CC's amazing CDs in their catalog, and out of all the LP's from the 80s, THIS is the one that means the most to me and the one I return to again & again.  It NEVER sounds tired, it NEVER sounds dated, it ALWAYS hits the spot.  It takes me back to my early teen years circa 1982/83 and defined that era when MTV really came into its own to transform the pop-music landscape forever. How can anyone who loves quality pop music deny the brilliant songwriting chops and production of sterling songs like BLACK MONEY, THAT'S THE WAY, IT'S A MIRACLE, MISS ME BLIND, CHURCH OF THE POISON MIND, and of course, VICTIMS, I think CC's most beautiful, mature, and poignant ballad ever!  And I haven't even mentioned HELEN TERRY, quite possibly the best back-singer ever?  Terry's fierce vocal interplay between BOY on almost every cut is staggering.  Bottom line, this is GREAT music that defies genres & could please toddlers to grandparents and everyone in between - maybe that explains why (even though it outstays its welcome) KARMA CHAMELEON is STILL the biggest UK single of all time?  CC isn't about 80s tired nostalgia, COLOUR BY NUMBERS is timeless, tuneful pop that demands to be in your CD collection.  Every home should have one.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I found this movie to be fascinating and thought-provoking since I am interested in the treatment of Christian dogma in film. While it had its horrific moments, I wanted to see this film because I wanted to see how Hell, devils and angels were represented. (I happened to love PROPHECY as well -- the one with Christopher Walken as a lethal Angel Gabriel) and this picture reminded me of it. I thought Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast. A flawed hero. And his verbal exchanges with the the Supernatural Hosts were sharply funny and darkly witty.<br /><br />I give it a 4 because I thought there should have been more of a backstory to that Knife they found at the beginning of the film, that monster of bugs was too CGI and I couldn't figure out about Hounsou's special chair. Some memorable moments were the passwords you require to get into Hounsou's bar, Lucifer's whole scene; the use of Holy Weaponry. The atmosphere of the picture gave me some idea of what its like to Be John Constantine. The person I saw this pic with was a Jesuit and he loved it. He's buying the DVD because its so full of fascinating detail that only a Jesuit would appreciate (its apparently very popular at the seminary.)<br /><br />Whether or not it was faithful to the graphic novels it was adapted from, we were both delighted with this film and it stands on its own.
B000002UA0|4.0|This CD is from the 1st of 3 stages Floyd went through<br /><br />1st stage was with Syd and his input, 2nd was with Dave Gilmore and a more melodic period through the 1970s and the 3rd stage was the domination of Roger Waters in the late 70s and early 1980s.<br /><br />This is a brilliant CD that needs to be played a few times before you can really appreciate it for what it is.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Wow. This movie seems to go in all directions at once. <br /> <br />First, there's the nominal kids' movie. Lots of color, no real violence, occasional and amusing bits of song, and a proper moral tone about the value of family, money, and good behavior. Then there's Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp's) bizarre character, ambiguous in his liking for the kids he invites, and gleeful in the self-inflicted weirdness that four of the five children experience. For the grown-up dragged along, there are witty references to bunches of other movies, including Kubrick's 2001, Sweet Haven architecture from Robin Williams' \\"Popeye\\", Edward Scissorhands, 1930s-style song-and-dance movies, and I don't know what all else. There's a remarkable echo of the new Hitchhiker's Guide movie, in Wonka's glass elevator, but the release dates of the two movies make intentional reference unlikely. Of course, Tim Burton's mad gadgeteering needs an outlet, which appears in a frightening bit of orthodonture. <br /> <br />Some bits may be a bit intense for skittish children, but the sense that \\"[s]he had it coming\\" generally outweighs any sense of threat. The Oompa Loompa's original diet is a high-grade gross-out, perfect for small boys (but maybe not their mothers). <br /> <br />This isn't Disneyfied, sugary pap. It's a lot more interesting than that. It seems to address approachable complexity to young viewers, but still give adults material of interest, something I haven't seen in recent kids' flicks. <br /> <br />The kids are optional, though. An adult can enjoy it too. <br /> <br />//wiredweird

Ray don't need no back-up or duos or Norah come latelys messing up his rhythm. All he needs is the piano and the Rayettes.  <br />This album was more painful than Aretha singing opera. And Willie Nelson, go back to Lubbock or Luchenbach because \\"That was a Very Bad Song.\\"  <br />Ray, RIP, brother...

It is tense, dramatic, well acted, well directed and all that - sadly the story leaves the ending basically impossible to do well.

Otherwise very entertaining movie. <br /> <br />&lt;3 Johnny Depp &lt;3
0425188809|5.0|Dean Koontz has made me into a midnight novel reading addict! \\"The Watchers\\" is a heart-warming, suspense-filled, science-based adventure story and romantic novel. It has enormous appeal due to the many intriguing, imaginative and spell-binding elements drawn from diverse sources. The story literally jumps off each page. One could argue who is the real hero in this book, Travis Cornell and his partner/wife, Nora Devon or Einstein, the genetically altered Golden Retriever, dog genius ...<br /><br />The enticing story and creative plot draw ideas from many sources: science, in the form of genetic experimentation with the best and worst outcomes, a hired assassin who has ghoulish creepy psychotic tendencies that make one's skin crawl, two National Security Agents, Lemuel Johnson and Walter Gaines who chase down the hero and heroine in the story and in the end demonstrate an unexpected compassionate and human side to their natures. And most importantly, Travis Cornell, the strong handsome former undercover operations soldier who goes hunting in the Santiago Canyon of Orange County California and unexpectedly discovers a golden retriever that he adopts or who adopts him ... which changes his life forever. The beauty of this story is how it blends science, horror, romance and heart warming elements in an intriguing and surprising whole.<br /><br />As Einstein gradually reveals his unique traits to Travis, the heart of every animal lover will melt. Numerous times while reading this book, this reader's eyes teared up in empathy during critical moments when the outcomes were uncertain ... Along with this wonderful dog, the reader becomes fond of Travis who comes to the rescue of Nora Devon, a beautiful recluse in her late 30s.

B0006L16N8|5.0|first song i heard was \\"yellow\\" and always cheered me up on the radio. i bought parachuetes and really really dug them. about as much as radiohead. spies is a fav of mine. everythings not lost was my least fav.    the second album i didnt like too much. ive only listened to the whole thing twice but some songs are good, like clocks,politik and a few more.    this album is good. about the same as parachuetes. yes, its more pop but id rather get good pop from coldplay than bad pop from jennifer lopes. i can listen to the Whole album without turning it off.    id give it 4n a half starz but i cant so 5 will do.
0385335482|4.0|You know, I admit that I did find myself getting annoyed with Becky, our heroine, and her way of spending and then not dealing with her problems, but then I realize that is only because Kinsella had managed to draw me into her world.  I empathized with Becky about wanting Prada's newest bag, but knowing I couldn't afford it and then buying it anyways.  (course, I not only have to find a way to pay for it, but to also justify the expense to my husband) I found myself wanting to tell her, \\"Just suck it up and learn to pay your bills!\\"  But then if she did that, we wouldn't have any more of these hilarious and fun books to read. <br /> <br />Kinsella writes with a warmth and a wit that many authors, hint at but never quite hit.  If you are looking for a light, but hilarious read, look no further.
B0008ISM40|5.0|This album is everything you'd expect from a NIN album and more. Although it is a slightly more silenced approach, it still has it's hard edge and somewhat machine driven music. \\"Only\\"& \\"With Teeth\\" are both perfect exsamples of the new \\"style\\" trent reznor has given the album. If you are a NIN fan you should without a doubt own it!
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Quo Vadis is a great classical film starring Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr and Peter Ustinov. It's on the MGM/UA Turner Collection Library own by Time/Warner Studio and it sits without an official DVD release preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition, while a terrible poor quality imports are been sold on the internet for over $40 each. <br /> <br />I can't comprehend why Time Warner Home Video have not taken notice of this and put a film dealing with the First Judeo/Christian Holocaust on a fast track restoration for a 2005 DVD release. <br /> <br />It's time for Time/Warner that would soon re-release a \\"Ben-Hur Collectors Edition\\" take also notice that \\"QUO VADIS\\" is a profitable asset to the studio sitting idle. <br /> <br />Among other on their classic movies collection, like is the case of Jack Hawkins \\"Land Of The Pharaohs\\" written by the great Willian Faulkner as well as another film directed by Vicente Minnelli \\"The 4 Horsemen Of The Apocalypse\\" starring Glenn Ford, Charles Boyer which deals about the Horrors of Nazi Germany. <br /> <br />All these classics of the 1950's vintage should have already been on Anamorphic Widescreen Restored DVD releases, instead of  gathering dust forgotten at the Time/Warner's Studios Film Library Vault.  <br /> <br />Can some body at Time/Warner order someone to please release them on DVD. <br />
B00097A5HW|2.0|I'm really disappointed. Shakira has so much talent and can write and sing such great songs, but on this album she doesn't show it.

B00005JN8Z|5.0|Quo Vadis \\"A PERFECTION OF SPECTACLE!\\" is a great classical film Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, Starring: Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Leo Genn and Peter Ustinov. Features splendid cinematograhy, fabulous sets and costume desings, magnificently photographed by Robert Surtees. \\"An Spectacular True 1950th's Classic.\\" <br /> <br />This jewel of a film \\"Quo Vadis\\" whose copyrights are owned by \\"TIME-WARNER INC.\\" It's nonetheless still sitting idle at their MGM/UA Turner Collection's Library without any official retoration on DVD scheduled yet, in spite of the fact that, when it was released in 1951 this movie became the 2nd highest box office take in \\"Hollywood's Film History.\\" Surpased only by the epic \\"Gone With The Wind.\\" <br /> <br />The restoration of this motion picture is 'LONG OVERDUE' from the point of view of film historians; and it should be presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. But unfortunately right now, only some appalling import copies of \\"Quo Vadis\\" are circulating on the internet, selling some for over $35 a piece. <br /> <br />I can't comprehend why Time-Warner Home Video, a great company at that, have not notice this problem and taken some action to correct this oversight, sooner rather than later. So at this point that \\"The Studio\\" had re-issued in September 13, 2005 the \\"Collectors Edition of Ben -Hur.\\" We feel that \\"QUO VADIS,\\" which was also produced by Sam Symbalist, could become a very profitable asset, if only this film that deals with \\"The First Judeo/Christian Holocaust\\" is put on a fast track restoration release schedule by Warner Brothers for an earlier release in 2007 and no later. <br /> <br />Ideally along with three other classic films that are at Warner Brothers Film Library Vault. The first one \\"Land Of The Pharaohs\\" by Director Howard Hawks, Starring: Joan Collins and Jack Hawkins (who also starred in \\"Ben-Hur.\\") The screenplay for this feature was done by no other than the great American writter William Faulkner. The second feature long overdue is \\"The 4 Horsemen Of The Apocalypse,\\" Directed by Vicente minelli, Starring: Glenn Ford, Ingrid Thulin, Charles Boyer, Lee J. Cobb and Paul Heinreid. Co-starring: Paul Lucas, Yvette mimeux and Karl Boehm. This one it's a searing drama, in which the Nazi monster set brother against brother following a family destructive linkup to the sinister horrors of Nazi Germany. A perfect match for another very profitable Warner Brothers DVD release dealing also with this Nazi subject matter: The legendary Luchino Visconti's \\"THE DAMNED.\\" <br /> <br />Last but not least also another movie long overdue and neglected \\"Valley Of The Kings,\\" which like \\"QUO VADIS\\" feature Robert Taylor in an starring role along with Eleanor Parker, Directed by Robert Piroh, when released three years after \\"QUO VADIS\\" on 07/23/54 was one of the first Cinemascope Movies. This one deals with the search by an archeologist daughter for evidence of the Joseph from Biblical times in Egypt. <br /> <br />\\"QUO VADIS\\" plot, of course, deals with Hollywood's screen most spectacular achivement up to this days. A magestic epic of passion and power taking place in 64 A.D. as Rome revels in pomp and debauchery under the insane Emperor Nero(Peter Ustinov.) Witness the birth of a \\"New Judeo Religion Group,\\" now called \\"Christians\\" that soon conflict with Nero's might, lust and greed. Which climaxes with \\"The Great Fire\\" of Rome that is followed up by the savagery \\"Holocaust\\" at the Circus Maximus. A sadistic orgy of madness, featured by Nero, for the sole reson of giving pleasure to his now decadent civilization. <br /> <br />The visual splendors of \\"QUO VADIS\\" still never seen today on classic epics is by its utter splendid pagentry, its shatering realism and also  magnificently photograhed by Rober Surtees left me only with this words of advice to you: \\"IT IS AWESOME!! TRUST ME.\\" <br /> <br />Therefore, all these Great Classic films of \\"Hollywood's 1950thépoque should already have been released, all fully restored. Either on anamorphic widescreen or presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition like it is the case of \\"QUO VADIS,\\" A feature film that predating \\"Computer Graphic Magic,\\" present us nonetheless with breathtaking sets, amazing sights and a multitude of thousands of real extras, that makes \\"QUO VADIS\\" a JEWEL FOR THE AGES\\" and a perfect choice for a big \\"DVD Collector's GOLD Edition.\\" <br /> <br />Unfortunately. perhaps due to an oversight by someone, or heavy schedulling of DVD releases at Time/Warner Bro. all this films are still \\"Gathering Star Dust\\" at \\"Warner Bro. Film Vault.\\" Without generating any revenues for 'The Studio' or otherwise providing us with some pleasurable joy, whenever we add them to our \\"DVD Home Video Collections.\\" <br /> <br />Can somebody remind \\"TIME-WARNER INC.\\" that they got there 'THESE FOUR GOLDEN CLASSIC MOVIES' still waiting to be fully retored and released on DVD. Which also are very apropos, for the times we living. <br /> <br />PLEASE!!! \\"TIME-WARNER INC.\\" RELEASE \\"QUO VADIS\\" NOW ON DVD FULLY RESTORED.
B0002XNDYU|4.0|Maquiladora is a great rock song, but it was probably left off the album as it sounds like a Pablo Honey leftover (but would have been one of the better songs on PH).  The Hexadecimal mix of Planet Telex does its best to sound dark and menacing, but isn't nearly as interesting as the lfo j.d. mix on the other single.  Still, it's not horrible, and these make for a pleasant listening (although why could they have put all the b-sides onto one release?)
B000002KYR|3.0|ZZ Top was a band that had been around for while when they released their most successful commercially successful album - 1983's \\"Eliminator\\".  \\"Eliminator\\" marked the band's ninth studio album.   This album came across at the right time for the trio of lead singer and guitarist Billy Gibbons, bassist Dusty Hill, and drummer Frank Beard.   This was the time the pop music landscape was being dominated by a Synthesizer-laden sound and MTV.    While ZZ Top had came from Blues origins, the music video played a key role in making them music superstars in the 1980s.   While \\"Eliminator\\" does have its moments, the conclusion I reach is that this album is overrated from an overall musical standpoint. <br /> <br />As mentioned, ZZ Top had established themselves as a Blues Based band.  When the early 1980s came - ZZ Top was still playing Blues music.   Their 1981 album, \\"El Loco\\" was an underrated album that had remained true to these roots.    It was around this time when many traditional Rock bands were now beginning to take advantage of the technology being offered by the Synthesizer.   Songs like \\"Leila\\" on \\"El Loco\\" hinted that they might be moving away from the Blues sound.   However it was on their next album, \\"Eliminator\\" that saw the use of the Synthesizer integrated into ZZ Top's sound.    But the synthesizer wouldn't dominate things - ZZ Top would use their powerful instrumentation - Gibbons' guitar, Hill's bass, and Beard's drums to help to define their sound.   In fact, they would take advantage of this thunderous instrumentation - and move toward a harder rock sound (with the help of some synthesizers).  At the same time, they wouldn't abandon their Blues roots completely. <br /> <br />Credit should be given to ZZ Top for integrating some new concepts into their sound.  However, I wouldn't say that this new sound is the greatest thing since sliced bread.  MTV and marketing had a lot to do with the band.  The band would capitalize on the music video revolution that was taking place during the 1980s.  Gibbons' and Hill's long beards, trench coats and sunglasses made them a very attractive commodity to the upstart cable network.   Add some sexy women to the videos and a sleek looking retro coupe car called \\"The Eliminator\\" and it would almost seem like they were tailor-made for MTV.   I think this has a lot to do with why ZZ Top became such a commercially successful draw with \\"Eliminator\\" and then later with their follow-up album, \\"Afterburner\\".   It is also worth noting that while ZZ Top has always maintained a core group of fans, their days as mainstream stars would soon fade as interest in Music Videos would fade going into the 1990s. <br /> <br />Three songs from \\"Eliminator\\" would become popular songs - along with their associated music videos.   The three songs are \\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", and \\"Legs\\".     \\"Legs\\" was probably the most popular song - and probably had something to do with the comeback of the miniskirt in 1983.  Eliminating all of the innuendo associated with \\"Legs\\", I look at this song musically:   This is a very guitar-driven sound - no doubt by Gibbons' hard playing guitar - but you will also hear the synthesizer integrated into the sound.   However, when you listen to \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" and \\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\", you will notice that these songs have a very similar-type of sound  from a guitar standpoint - especially in the chords.  However, I think these songs are stronger from a guitar standpoint.   I'd put \\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\" as the strongest of the three. (I especially like Beard's great drum intro)   The problem is - I grow real tired of these songs quickly because they do have such a similar sound.   <br /> <br />There are some hard rock songs that do sound different than the \\"Big 3\\".   \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\" is an underrated track - that does have a combination of the heavy guitar and synthesizers.   It's a good song, but the chorus is somewhat of a let-down.   Another harder-edged song is \\"I Got the Six\\".   This song almost has an \\"Arena/Hard Rock\\" quality to it.  Gibbons' guitar shines again on that track.   The collection's final track is \\"Bad Girl\\".  Like \\"I Got the Six\\", ZZ Top employs a similar \\"Arena Rock\\" quality to it. <br /> <br />The track \\"Thug\\" is a very interesting one.  This is probably the most \\"80s\\" sounding Synth-Pop track.   It's not a bad song, but it's not a great one.   It's definitely something different by ZZ Top. <br /> <br />The Blues are still present on many tracks.  In fact, I think ZZ Top is true to their roots and show their strength is still in this area.   This will be heard on tracks such as \\"I Need You Tonight\\".   This track almost has a Led Zeppelin-like Blues start to it.   Perhaps the best track on the album is \\"TV Dinners\\".  This is one of the simplest tracks both musically and lyrically.  It is a song about - well, food.  It has a very simple Blues track to it and the formula works very well here.  \\"Dirty Dog\\" is another Blues-laden track, but this one has a harder rock edge to this song.  \\"If I Could Only Flag Her Down\\" is another very strong track (possibly the second strongest).  On this track, ZZ Top employs a classic Southern Rock style Blues style. <br /> <br />My conclusion about \\"Eliminator\\" is that the MTV tracks probably are a bit overrated.   The Harder Rock stuff is ok, but not great.  The Synth Pop experiment on \\"Thug\\" doesn't have me doing handstands.  Overall,   I still look at ZZ Top's strength to be in their Blues roots - and this is demonstrated nicely on \\"Eliminator\\".   Overall, if you are looking at ZZ Top even to get the MTV hits, you may be pleasantly surprised by the Blues work.   However, I'd recommend this for getting the Blues-laden songs only.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|I've never been a Mariah Carey fan, I'm one who usually found her voice a bit irritating, but listening to the 1st 2 singles off this albums I realised how great this album is! It has more a a modern day sound (more RnB) and she does have a great voice! <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - The first single of the CD, It's a classic RnB sound, I couldnt believe it was Maraih singing when I 1st heard it on the radio! It's one of the best track on the album 8/10  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - This is the 2nd single, and it is a beauty. Its a beautful ballad, the best track on the album 10/10 <br /> <br />3.

B00005JNSK|4.0|If you grew up watching \\"Willie Wonka\\", you may not enjoy this one as much: not as \\"musical\\" (at least not as romantic and human, so to speak -no \\"Imagination\\" or \\"Golden Ticket\\" songs, for example) and certainly not as deep of a message as the one you may take away with the original with Wilder.<br /><br />However, it has its own merits: the kid that plays Charlie is perfect, the movie as a whole comes across as pretty funny, indeed funnier than the original (Depp is able to pull of more laughs, as he was with \\"Pirates...\\") and also the effects, as expected, are WAY better! Last, there were some parts of the story that were developed a little more than in the original.<br /><br />As for those who have read about a comparison with Michael Jackson, yes: there's definitely something there. :D<br /><br />Overall, I give it 4 out of 5 stars.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Seriously.  I used to have a normal life, with normal friends and real conversations.  By chance I watched the Veronica Mars pilot.  I liked the show and decided to tivo it.  Then, somehow, by the middle of the season I was totally, gloriously obsessed.  All conversation around my house revolved around Veronica Mars.  All interaction with friends involved trying to convert them.  Even now, months after the end of the season, even knowing who killed Lilly, we still talk about it all the time.<br /><br />As Logan says, \\"you have a problem with Veronica, you're pretty much dead to me.\\"
B00005JNJT|5.0|This film is brooding and dark, but also exciting and smart, Batman Begins is a film that understands the essence of one of the definitive superheroes.<br /><br />\\"Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale)--the billionaire prince of Gotham whose parents were killed in an alleyway mugging--transformed into the crime-fighting superhero. With flashbacks to his privileged childhood, young Master Wayne, as he is called by the butler Alfred (Michael Caine), develops a terrible fear of bats when he falls through the backyard garden into a hidden cave. As a young adult, Wayne lives among the League of Shadows, a martial arts group in the mountains of Asia. His leaders Ra's al Ghul (Ken Watanabe) and Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson) teach him strength, endurance, and--unfortunately--evil, against which he naturally rebels. Returning to Gotham and reinstating himself as a dapper socialite and the rightful heir to his parents' enterprise, Wayne quickly devises his secret identity, commanding help from the gadgetry expert Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman). With one eye on his childhood playmate Rachel (Katie Holmes)--now a beautiful woman and dedicated lawyer--and the other on his mission to save Gotham from criminal corruption, Batman makes his fledgling debut. But when the blue-blooded mastermind Dr. Crane (Cillian Murphy)--who steals every scene with chilling menace--taints the water system with a hallucinatory substance, Batman realizes he has met his first true opponent.\\"<br /><br />Good story, excellent character developement, and awesome action scenes make this the best batman movie to come out in years. Only complaint is that the scarecrow didn't get enough screen time, but he'll be back. This is a definite must see for fans and non fans of the series alike. This year lady and gentlemen, Batman Begins!
B000641Z90|5.0|Ok, if anyone has been a follower of anything that Phil Collins has done in his career - I recommend that you get yourself a copy of this DVD --You will be so pleased!<br /><br />  The picture is Awesome,the sound is Awesome, the songs are Awesome ( get the picture )!

B00000JGHS|4.0|Yes, this guilty pleasure movie is a hell of a lot better then Showgirls (poor Liz Berkley)<br /><br />Demi Moore plays Erin, a mother that just got divorced from her sleazy of a husband (Robert Patrick of T2 fame), and has lost custody of her daughter (played by her real life daughter!)In order to get an appeal for the case Erin gose to work at a strip club, she becomes that clubs start dancer because she's hot and is a decent dancer, however her antics attract a crazed fan and a horny congressmen. Erin tries to use the congressmen to get her a far chance at getting her daughter back from her ex that like to steal wheel chairs, however, people near the congress men are afraid that Erin might something that could cause embarrassment tohim, and hurt some of his shady friends in the sugar industry.<br /><br />Base off a hilarious book by Carl Hiassen, the movie is able to capture MOST of the people, story and humor of the book.  Although less endowed in the book, Demi is able to perform Hiassen's character with the beauty and intelligence we saw when we read the book, although the political undertones of Florida politics (Hiassen trade mark) are gone the movie dose do the book some justice compared to how other books that have been made into movies.<br /><br />BTW-I read the book before I saw the movie.
0738206709|4.0|The book is mainly based on the information collected by the author from various people via e-mail, telephone or personal communication between September 1999 and September 2000, and the interview with Linus Torvalds at a critical juncture in his life, in December 1996, as well as other interviews with key players from the last three years. <br /> <br />The book begins with a story of Richard Stallman, who labored for years to create a Unix-like system, written from scratch that would be free. Hw worked alone at first; then he gradually received contributions from to others, including - thought neither of them knew it in 1991 - Linus, whose Linux program would provide the last major pieces still missing from Stallman's huge software jigsaw puzzle. <br /> <br />The book covers the GNU project from its formal beginning, when in January 1984 Stallman started working on Bison, which was a replacement for Yacc. Having limbered up with this relatively minor task, he moved on to one of the most important. One of the key elements of a Unix system is the C compiler. After an unsuccessful attempt, he returned to Emacs and released GNU Emacs in September 1984. In October 1985 he has founded Free Software Foundation and then proceeded with C compiler and the C library. <br /> <br />The book then describes the biography of Linus, his years at the university and his work on his operating system, his experience with Minix, quite popular at that time in academic area, and fight with Tanenbaum, the author of Minix. The book then brings out the history of the development of Linux in detail. <br /> <br />Besides Linux, this book covers Open Source movement in Netscape, the development of TEX, Perl, Cygnus, etc., and how big companies like IBM adopt Open Source software and contribute to its development. <br /> <br />I would also recommend \\"The Cathedral & the Bazaar\\" by Eric S. Raymond in addition to this book.
0694003611|5.0|My youngest really enjoyed the book. I had great time as well. It's so much fun and wonderful way to interact with the baby. The illustrations keep her attention. A perfect gift book! Another book that I think is definitely worth the money is I Have a Problem by Carolyn Apel. My 5 year old daughter loves this book. She requests it almost every night.
B00005JNTX|5.0|The negative review below that gripes about it being a \\"comic book style\\" movie is indicitive of the typical ignorance of the naysayers of this film.  Of course it's a comic book style, it's a comic book movie.  Comic book and film noir, two of the cheesiest styles ever.  And no story?  I can only assume that the people that say this are too busy playing games on their cell phones instead of paying attention to the film.  There are 3 very distinct stories, all of them told in a spectacular fashion with stellar acting. <br /> <br />This film is a beautiful transfer from Frank Miller's graphic novels.  You can look at the panels of the graphic novels and see the exact scenes from the movie.  As mentioned in the editorial review, the only real change is the lessening of nudity in the film.  No big loss, although every red-blooded male wishes that Jessica Alba had done the topless scene. <br /> <br />Buy this movie and, while you're at it, get the 3 graphic novels it's based on:  Sin City: The Hard Goodbye, Sin City: The Big Fat Kill, and Sin City: That Yellow Bastard.  While you're at it, pick up Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and get the backstory on Dwight and the girls of Old Town.
B0000399WI|5.0|The box office was cruel to this film.  Whether it was the lack of a catchy title, or the rather bland movie poster showing Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the true spirit of this film never got the attention it deserved at it's big-screen opening.  For this, I'm guilty, too.  I showed no interest in it when it opened.  Never have I been so wrong in judging a movie.  The motion picture awards institutions were wrong in not properly recognizing this film as possibly the greatest of all time.  I never expected a prison film to be my all-time favorite.<br /><br />It was two precious years before my brother convinced me to see it.  I must say, no film has ever driven me to tears like this one did.  It is a compelling story of the strength of human character, emerging from the most hopeless of situations.  As it turns out, hope is exactly what empowers the prisoners of Shawshank.<br /><br />(Spoiler ahead!) The cinematography and musical score are magical, especially in the scene where Red is dropped off in Buxton to search the fields for Andy's stash, and where he finally reunites with Andy in Mexico.  It just streams with emotion.  The script: superbly written.  All this was put together by a talented director who can go to his grave knowing he orchestrated one of the finest films in history.  Of course, Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown and other supporting cast members deserve much credit for the emotion they put into their respective characters.<br /><br />If you are one of the unfortunate people who haven't seen this film, you're missing out, big time.  I envy those who are watching it for the first time.  It is so completely engrossing a story, never boring, with a truely satisfying ending.  It exudes hope.  It defines redemption.
0790731452|5.0|Nine years after it came out, and I'm still wandering why I like this movie so much. A person like me shouldn't really like \\"Mars Attacks!\\". In fact, I should despise. However, for some reason, I like this movie. As a matter of facy, I love this movie. It's pretty much your typical Burton vehicle, and while it's not his best movie (\\"Batman\\" and \\"Batman Returns\\" can fight for that title), this film is definitely one of my favorites from him.<br /><br />\\"Mars Attacks!\\" features the standard Burton formula, a movie with a thin plot and loads of top notch special effects. It once again works here in this over the top tribute to 1950s' sci fi B - movies. However, the film's strongest asset without a doubt its cast. Burton made the right move by filling the cast with a variety of well known faces. If he had just put in one or two well known actors and surrounded them with second rate character actors, I don't think this film would have worked. But this film has a gaggle of famous faces, which should give you enough reason to watch this film.<br /><br />The Joker himself, Jack Nicholson, reunites with Burton to once again work the magic they created seven years earlier in \\"Batman\\". This time, Jack plays a dual role: the snotty President of the United States and a wealthy, sleazy casino owner. Add to that Glenn Close, Danny DeVito, Pierce Brosnan, Annette Bening, Michael J. Fox, Rod Steiger, Pam Grier, Paul Winfield, Martin Short, Sarah Jessica Parker, Lukas Haas, Natalie Portman, Joe Don Baker, Jack Black, Jim Brown, Sylvia Sidney and Tom Jones, and you have just about enough stars to light up the night sky. Plus, you've got cool looking green martians obliterating most of them with cool ray guns, plus a really cool space language (\\"gak, gak gak). And best of all, they blow up Congress! Yippee.<br /><br />If you're in for an intelligent, deep and profound masterpiece of a film, then you should skip \\"Mars Attacks\\". But if you just want to see mindless eye candy overloaded with campiness and filled to the brim with famous people, then go and buy this movie.d to the brim with famous people, then go and buy this movie.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I went to see this yesterday, after looking forward to its release for the past several months.  Usually if I'm looking forward to something like that, I leave the theater disappointed.  Thankfully, that was not the case this time.  In my opinion, Tim Burton is a directing genius, always providing us with classic films, and Danny Elfman's accompanying score and Oompa-Loompa song and dance routines are all too fun.  I'm not sure where everyone got hooked on this idea that \\"Charlie...\\" was supposed to be cute and musical and all that, but if you've ever read the book, or any of Dahl's books, you may recall that there isn't too much there to go Awwww about.  Especially not with the songs.  I'm thrilled and pleased that Burton kept this true to the book and ignored the cuddliness of the first film adaptation.  And I'm also glad that the songs are straight from the pages.  Needless to say, the acting is phenomenal.  Charlie is loveable from the beginning for how good and giving he really is.  (HINT to ALL PARENTS:  Take lessons from Charlie's parents.  Too many act like the rest of the crowd.)  So there you have it, a fun movie, inredible music, delightful performances.  You couldn't ask for more from a summer movie.

B0007GAEW6|3.0|Instead of placing myself in one of the two camps of reviewers here , i.e. those who think it's humbrum and those you think it's jim-dandy, I'm going to stick to the middle ground. I both love and hate TMV, both their albums. I was turned on to DITC about a year ago and it took me several listens over a six month period before I could appreciate it (and I consider myself to be a listener of all kinds of different music). Just when I began to really enjoy DITC I picked up Frances. Again, it took me a few listens (and some time) to actually appreciate the album. Currently, however, TMV enjoys a fairly prominent spot on my playlist. Yes, I think TMV could have done better with both of their albums, especially Frances. There are times when the music (noise) gets annoying but there are times when it is down right inspirational and enjoyable. Despite such criticisms I have, TMV's music is much like that of my life and I guess that's why I have come to like it (and they are not the only band to do this, but so what?). Sometimes life is troublesome and humdrum but at other times its quite exceptional and jim-dandy, just like TMV's music. It's full of passion yet also full of pretentiousness. It's inspiration and derogatory. So, what's wrong or right with all of this -- absolutely everything. I listen to TMV because they remind me of me and I take the good with the bad and the bad with the good, just like their albums. If you are looking for 77 minutes of timeless, masterful pieces or if you are looking for the worst rock noise available then check out something else. But if your in the mood for something that could possibly mirror life, if only but a glimpse or slight reflection, then I recommend listening to TMV, both their albums. I think that the rather inferior parts of their music make the more superior parts stand out that much more while the superior parts extenuate the inferior parts, and that's life, both the unreal and real moments of it. And conceptually I thinkthe albums are both quite original, although this may not be such a good thing. In spite of all of this, or because of it, I like TMV.
0786880708|4.0|I have long had an interest in meditation and bought the audio version of this book a while ago. I have listened to it on and off and find the mindfulness aspect to be quite useful. While confirming to the Buddhist tradition, it is quite secular and easy to understand and practice and with visible benefits.<br /><br />I have since had the good fortune to take meditation classes with Erhard Vogel (Nataraja Ashram) and use the companion book, [[ASIN:1892484056 Journey Into Your Center, Second Edition]]. The meditation is loosely based on the Advaita school of Hinduism but is equally secular as the mindfullness school. I like Erhard Vogel's appraoch way more.<br /><br />I feel that the acceptance of equality among all and consequent divinity of all to be intrinsically positive and affirming. It takes away many of the false constructs that are the reason for most misery and frames life as a gloriously positive thing. Since we are all equal and equally divine, there is no reason to hate, fear, indulge in vanity, greed, pettiness etc. When these normal pre-occupations of the mind are removed, our time and energy is now availabe to discover what fulfills us in truth and to allign our actions and experiences in accord to that. Our mind then is required to fuifill one (and only one) important function - which is to reflect our personal divinity at all times and to frame all our experiences in this context. We can then use our faculties (mind, body, senses, feelings and emotions, intellect and intuitition) to choose actions (at will) that fulfill us and also express our gloriousness. This is not the same as saying one must repress normal life experiences and consequent emotions - it is to view them in the right context and with the right perspective and to let them pass if they are contrary to the true being that we are. This allows for normal life experiences in all their colorfulness without the associated attachment and long term baggage.<br /><br />I am a very scientificperson and have never felt that the approach takes away from my curiosity about things, my scientific scepticism and experience and experimentation-based mode of learning. In fact most Advaita schools and definitely Erhard Vogel's approach is for participants to learn only through their own experiences.<br /><br />While easy to understand, living in accord with our divinity and pricinples takes practice and real courage. The meditation program iteslf is three year long (and available to anyone in the world through the Internet) - but the benefits are available from the very beginning. I am six months into it and am a whole new person. I went from a big company, cushy job without any rensposibilities to leading the systems group of a small company. Less money, more learning and fun and more responsibility to get things to work. (I have no ego about the lead job, BTW :-))<br /><br />While the mindfullness approach and Kabat-Zinn's books in particular were useful, I found (and still do), the Erhard approach to Meditation (where you don't \\"do\\" meditation but it is how you live) to be very holistic and much more beneficial.<br /><br />This is not to say it is better, only that it suits my temperment and intellect a lot more. I am sure others might come to a different conclusion. I would nevertheless encourage everyone to look at the Advaita tradition as well. It will not take away from your learning and can only add to it.
B000002J09|5.0|Simply put, \\"Led Zeppelin IV\\" is the real deal. Considered by many to be the best hard rock album ever made, its song selection is simply incredible. \\"Black Dog,\\" \\"Rock and Roll,\\" and \\"Going to California\\" are essential classic rock FM staples. \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is the most requested rock track of all time, despite never being released as a single.  While I have lost connection over the years with great but for-rebellious-teens hard rock records like \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" by Guns N' Roses and \\"Paranoid\\" by Black Sabbath, \\"Led Zeppelin IV,\\" like a fine wine, has aged to perfection. Jimmy Page's extravagent wall of guitars and John Bonham's thunderous drum claps appeal to the young, while the Tolkien-inspired lyrics found in \\"Misty Mountain Hop\\" and \\"Stairway\\" make this an entertaining listen for the not-so-young. \\"Led Zepplein IV\\" or \\"Runes\\" is highly recommended.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|This is a pretty good movie, but I've seen a lot better. It has a lot of traces though of other movies that have already been done before. And Christian Bale looks horrible in this movie. Its quite disgusting. I don't see why he had to get that skinny for this part. loosing weight i can see, but geez. He was barely even there. As for Christian Bale's acting. AWESOME. He should of been nominated for something for his role in this. Very good acting. Some times through the movie he was acting so well I almost forgot it was him.....Worth renting, but I'm not to sure about owning it unless you find it for cheap...
0767830555|4.0|Taxi Driver is obviously a classic.  It has inspired numerous filmmakers and further established the career of Robert De Niro as one of the preeminent actors of our time.  The story is about Travis Bickle (De Niro) who, to quote Pauline Kael's review, \\"has no point of entry into human society.\\"  Bickle turns to his violent fantasies after a campaign worker (Cybill Shepherd) rejects him- and thus his final attempt to connect with other people.  This culminates in a famous scene of heinous violence. But just because a film is about disconnection doesn't necessarily mean that it has to diconnect its audience.  Ultimately, that's how I felt.  Here's why.      -It's meandering.      This is a film with many shots- carefully planned and technically beautiful shots.  But at times, they seem to exist in of themselves and not to further the story, the character, or the mood.  The shot going into a foaming glass of alka seltzer being just one example.  These shots eventually add up and contribute to a sense of tedium.  Also, the endless scenes of De Niro in his apartment eating cereal, practicing with his guns, or watching TV start to feel like exercises, revealing little that we don't already know.    -Travis Bickle is inexplicable.    In order to watch for 2 plus hours essentially a one-character tragedy, that one character has to be interesting.  As Schrader's script is written though, Travis isn't as compelling as he should.  De Niro's performance is good, especially in his early scenes when his social ineptitude towards Cybill Shepherd's character is sweetly endearing (he takes her to a porno theater on a date and can't figure out why she's offended).  And when he says to his cabbie friend (played by Peter Boyle) that he's worried about \\"bad ideas\\" you see a man slipping from sanity, while at the same time trying to preserve his morality by \\"saving\\" a young prostitute (Jodie Foster). These short scenes of De Niro interacting speak volumes, and it's unfortunate that Scorsese and Schrader primarily chose to depict De Niro through his rituals, which as I said earlier, have little nuance and feel static.      With that all said, there's enough good in Taxi Driver to obviously warrant a viewing.  A few examples:    -The New York City setting    Everything about this film evokes the scuzziness of New York City in the 1970's.  Scorese films the potholes, hookers, pimps, and porno theaters with such contempt that we fully understand why Travis hates it.  The place is a sewer, and the pimp (played by Harvey Keitel) that Travis targets is a symbol of how hellish the city is.    -Jodie Foster    I really liked Jodie Foster's supporting performance as the 12-year old prostitute, Iris.  She's only in a few short scenes but she captures the innocence-gone-bad that Travis so despises.    In one scene, she's just a regular kid, eating some toast and giggling, and yet she's been thrust into this disgusting world.      -The Palantine Subplot    The artificial stump speeches of presidential candiate, Senator Palantine and the septic bourgeois banter between Betsy (Cybill) and her friend (Albert Brooks) is chilling in an odd way.  It's as though the political campaign symbolizes a \\"civilized\\" and benevolent society, and yet it is completely oblivious to the hell that is out there, and thus allows the Irises and Travises of the world to suffer.  One of Palpatine's talking points is ending poverty and crime.  And yet, when he talks to Bickle in a cabbie by chance, his phony political good-guy schtick is perversely transparent, and it's clear that he isn't interested in genuine connection- which this film argues- propels crime and violence.    Anyway, I recommend seeing Taxi Driver.  It's a good movie- a bonafide classic.  It's not as emotional or visceral as it should be, and falls into tedious lapses, but that doesn't detract from the influence it has had or the power it still can have over audiences.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|I'm with Asthmatic Kitty, so my rating should be removed from the overall rating. The review \\"Borntolie B\\" credits to him or herself is actually the same review that appeared on Rollingstone.com, credited there, accurately, to Rob Sheffield.
B000002UAU|5.0|Ahem. This week I have noticed that Amazon.com has begun to add \\"Original Recording Remastered\\" to CDs that most definitely were *not* (example: Van Morrison CDs on Warner Bros.), but seeing \\"[DELUXE EDITION]\\" on the page for this one has caused me to speak up.  <br /> <br />As most every fan knows, The Beatles catalogue (bar Yellow Submarine) is still, famously, awaiting the day EMI initiates a remastering and reissue program. Until then, The Beatles' albums are available on CDs--the same ones issued back in 1987 (the dawn of the CD era).  <br /> <br />So... Why must Amazon.com put the misleading \\"[DELUXE EDITION]\\" next to this CD's title when no such edition exists? This product page is only misrepresenting the original 1987 CD issue. Oftentimes, albums exist on CD in 2 or more editions (remastered or not, deluxe, etc.). One should be able to rely on Amazon.com's product titles and descriptions to discern between them. Right? I just hope this is only some small mistake on Amazon's part, not a worrying trend. Trust is important after all.   <br /> <br />Anyway... I love this album. It's one of, if not the, best albums of all time. If you are at all interested in the Beatles, then you should definitely get yourself a copy of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band ASAP. Who knows how long we'll be waiting for a *real* deluxe edition of this wonderful album? ;)
B000002LR6|4.0|This is  the last really good Ministry album, despite the fact it is basically a retread of the far superior Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste. Musically it's  more or less heavy metal, with a few electronics thrown into the mix for some variety. A few slower numbers  create a better sense of flow. In other words it doesn't just bash the listener over the head like some of the last few Ministry albums have. A keeper.
B0000942HV|5.0|Thirty years after it's first spectacular release(1973) upon an unaware public, Mike Oldfield has gone back to his classic debut solo recording and redone the whole thing. This can sometimes be a dreadful mistake, going back to former glories but not in this case , where Mike Oldfield has been able to rework his work of genius ( Even more remarkable considering he recorded the original when he was only seventeen and all the recording was done over a two week period in studio downtime.)<br /><br />It was Richard Branson's fledgling record label Virgin that gave the young Mr. Oldfield his big break, quite a risk,a small independent record label, for it's first ever release, taking on a teenager ,and letting him release two sides of vinyl with no traditional song structures ,without anything like the sung word featuring. But between them of course they went on to make enough money out of this album alone, to Keep Branson in Hot Air Balloons and Oldfield in ever increasing studios. Tubular Bells has topped the charts all over the world, with over 16 million in sales ,is considered an important historical document, and with a whole generation has reverential status.It's first major breakthrough came when devilishly good horror movie 'The Excorcist' of the same year chose the 'Caveman' section of music to accompany some of the movies most scary moments.<br /><br />So what has Mike Oldfield done to make his original work of genius even greater? Thereby further lining the well adorned pockets of himself and everyone's favorite British millionaire Richard Branson.<br /><br /> Well for a kick off the whole production is much fatter,and brighter than before, with the bass being mixed far higher up in the mix , giving a great contrast to Mike Oldfield's distinctive guitars which are layered over the top. 'The Caveman' has been properly up dated and is no longer just a musical orgy of grunts and groans ,but is now quite musical, Mike has been helped out here by the addition of some superb harmonizing grunting and groaning from his sister Sally. The bagpipes on the final rampage through the Sailors Hornpipe, have finally been recorded properly with quite startling results, if you go back and listen to the original it is quite obvious even to the untrained ear that perhaps one instrument that Mike had not quite mastered at the time of the original recording was the sometimes uncontrollable pipes. This time though it fair rips along.With today's technology as well ,it is possible to make each instruments , ( As it is he himself a some what older and wiser Mr.Oldfield who yet again plays all the instruments on this epic.) stand out on its own making it fascinating listening ,as you can hear something new each time you play it.<br /><br />Due to the untimely death of Viv Stanshall who did the original voiced introductions of each instrument during the 'Finale' section,a new voice had to be found, and who better than Basil Fawlty himself, John Cleese? Who steps into the breech with perfect phrasing saving his best \\"pining for the fjords'' voice for the announcement of the arrival of the \\" double speed guitar\\",marvelous stuff.Still bringing a smile to the face after you have listened to the album a hundred times. Best of all though is that you no longer have to get up half way through to turn the album over, as these days a Compact Disc can store all of it's 50 minutes worth of grooves on one side.<br /><br />There are two ways to buy this album ,as a single disc , or as part of a box set that includes the new 2003 version of Tubular Bells,Tubular Bells 2 from 1992,Tubular Bells 3 from 1998, plus a wonderful DVD Oldfield experience with film to go with the music.( To be fair Tubular Bells 3 is absolute rubbish, but then nobody can be great all the time ,and at only just over forty Baht extra per CD difference between the single CD and the box set you cannot really complain.)<br /><br />One thing you will not get from this collection is the ability to burn your friends copies of the 2003 edition as that clever Mr. Oldfield has used his studio trickery to make it impossible to burn off spare copies. But if you liked the original recording of Tubular Bells? You will love the new one even more.<br /><br />Tubed by Mott The Dog.<br /><br />Belled by Ella Crew.of the 2003 edition as that clever Mr. Oldfield has used his studio trickery to make it impossible to burn off spare copies.

B0002858YS|5.0|A self-titled high-school musical connoisseur, I give this album my praise. It's been a very long time since a band has made a debut album this masterfully. . . I dare compare it to U2's Boy. There are plenty of people who want to harp on Hot Fuss, and suggest replacements such as Franz Ferdinand or Interpol, but the fact of the matter is none of those bands have the sheer talent and staying power that I see in The Killers. The opening track (Jenny was a Friend of Mine) is just brilliance, sheer brilliance, with its masterful use of powerful guitar, jumpy bass line and more synthesizer than we've heard since Duran Duran. The synth-heavy trend continues throughout the rest of the album, but unlike so much of the New Wave stuff, the synthesizer lines are used tastefully! Who would have thought? I predict The Killers will be around for a long time to come: They've got the sex appeal to match Duran Duran, the vocals and music to rival U2, and lyrics that could move any Pink Floyd Nazi out there. Yes sir, you haven't heard the last of The Killers.
B0007YMUZW|3.0|Alas, this is another one of those situations where you see several five-star reviews for an album and then you turn around and see my three-star review. It's not that I don't think Ryan Adams is a good artist; it's just that the way Cold Roses was put together is kind of strange.<br /><br />The main reason I rated this album three stars is because Ryan sounds completely different on every song. For those that disagree, listen to any three tracks in a row and tell me it doesn't sound like a different vocalist on each one. Because of this, it might be hard for people to enjoy otherwise good songs like \\"Magnolia Mountain\\", \\"Blossom\\" or \\"Sweet Illusions\\". But there are some skippable tracks on here too, like the overproduced \\"Beautiful Sorta\\". And the obligatory keep-your-head-up song \\"Life Is Beautiful\\" is fine until Ryan starts to say things like, \\"If I don't believe in love/Then I don't believe in you/And I do.\\"<br /><br />It's kind of strange that this album is a double-disc set, considering that the first disc is 39 minutes long and the second disc is 36 minutes long. Combined, that's only close to 76 minutes, but at the same time, that's a little too long for a single disc nowadays. And speaking of the discs, neither one is labeled DISC 1 or DISC 2. How are we supposed to know which is which?<br /><br />Oh, well; I'm sure Ryan Adams won't lose any fans with this release, but when I tell people I like more variety in my music, I don't mean the singer's voice. If you feel the same way, you might want to think before you decide to pick some cold roses.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B00005JNSK|5.0|Though I am getting tired of this new trend of remaking old movies, I have to admit that this is one of the best movies I've seen in awhile. I typically do not even like Tim Burton's movies very much, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was definitely an exception. Some of the characters have been modified slightly from the book and original movie, but in a good way. Johnny Depp did an excellent job as Wonka, as did the boy who played Charlie. The score by Danny Elfman was superb. <br /> <br />I think what made this movie so great was that it was not really an attempt to remake an old movie, but rather a new adaptation of the book. Now, it's probably been 20 years since I read the book by Roald Dahl, but I thought this movie stayed truer to the book than the original movie did, if memory serves me correctly. Of course, a separate side story about how Willy Wonka became a \\"chocolateer\\" was added. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember this aspect being in the original book.  <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great movie for the whole family to enjoy. The kid-friendly story, language, and characters combined with the comedy that even adults can enjoy make this a must-see for anyone.
0399230033|5.0|I first purchased this book from Amazon when my son was only ten months old.  At first I was disappointed because there are so few words in the book.  Having purchased it from Amazon, I had not seen the book from cover to cover.  However, it didn't take me long to realize what a great opportunity this was for my son to use his imagination and critical think about each illustration.  In a very short amount of time he was telling me what each page said, whether it happened to be one with words or not!  What a pleasure it was to see him critically thinking in this manner and at such a young age!  I would highly recommend this to any parent.  My son was also able to catch on very quickly that there is a mouse to be found on every single page.  He is now 29 months old and still begs me to read it him!
B000069AUI|1.0|This is the way you spell \\"politics\\" if your pallet has only known the trendy and expensive taste of Starbucks' Double-java Mocha Gooey-ass Frappalattcino: \\"politik\\". Apparently, all you Starbucks-sippin' snots like to replace c's with k's... just like \\"kraftwerk\\" or \\"kraft cheese foods\\". You trendy German-wannabes krack me up. <br /> <br />This album is not profound. It's not even good. It all blends into one dull, unmemorable haze. No one I know is familiar with any Cold Play song other the one with that repeating piano line. It might be \\"Clocks\\", but I don't know, nor do I care. The song is basically a 10 second piano loop played for 6:49 seconds with Chris Martin's plain vanilla voice crooning badly. His grating croon makes him sound like he's attempting to mimic the performance of a second-rate lounge act that just got kicked out of the bar area for not being rowdy enough while drunk. But he can't even pull that off good enough. The guy has no freakin' range to the point that it's disgusting. Bottom Line: Cold Play is a band afraid to take risks. If this was a lie, then the masses would be aware of another Cold Play song besides \\"the one with that repeating piano line\\".

0440238609|4.0|I love the one star reviewers of the Dark Materials books. To a man thay lambast Mr Pullman's religious views - of which they know precisely nothing. Can his views be inferred from the books? Perhaps. Perhaps not. Just having a thought that's \\"anti-Christian\\" ( whatever THAT means ) does not mean you hold that thought as your dogmatic world view. The intolerant can never understand this point because to them, the thought and the action are the same thing. That comes from that stupid \\"committed adultery in his heart\\" line from the Bible.<br /><br />This logic leads inexorably to checking your citizenry's reading habits - \\"just to be on the safe side\\".<br /><br />Great writers have always railed against authority figures. And now in our more frightening world of entrenched religious camps, its a good thing to call attention to fanaticism and to say \\"hold on, perhaps our side isn't always on the side of the angels\\" ( pun intended ).<br /><br />And as for those people who simply resort to saying \\"he can't write\\", check out the prizes Mr Pullamn has won. Heck \\"The Amber Spyglass\\" was in the running for the Booker prize in the UK - that country's most prestigious literary prize.<br /><br />These books are darkly subversive and so are excellent books for kids.<br /><br />Because if they don't learn to kick against authority when they are young, they'll just end up as the people in town hall meetings who say \\"I love you as my President\\".

The Beats are very good and the lyrics are the best you will hear for a while. Nas really proved he is a real amazing rapper. I got this album cuz i like nas's music and because i have heard such good things about this album. I got it for 20$ ya it was a little pricy for an album with only 10 tracks but it ias an album with 10 amazing tracks. If this album was $25 you should still get it there should be no hesetation and trust me you will not have buyers remorse or guilt. This album is sooooo amazing and sooo hot. Nas's best album ever. If you want a very amzazing album then BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!If you like Jay-Z, Common, Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, The Game, Eminem, Dr.Dre, K-OS, DMX, or G-Unit then this album is for you!!!You will not regret buying this album trust me.
0312335164|5.0|Susan Fletcher is one of the top code breakers working for the National Security Administration.  Her fiance is a professor at Georgetown.  Both have been called in on an emergency that threatens national security, but neither knows that the other is involved, nor that they are being manipulated.  The question is why and by whom??  The NSA has a top secret computer that is capable of breaking any encryption code and thus reading the secrets of everyone that transmits electronically - from the common housewife to the most complex terrorist.  But there are some out there that feel that this ability to walk in on a person's privacy is going too far and that NSA should come clean about their capabilities.  However there are high level employees that will stop short of nothing to make sure that this is a discovery never made.  But when a outside program takes over NSA's super computer, it is anybody's guess as to whom will wind up on top in the end.    Dan Brown has again mastered the art of a novel that travels at break neck speed.  He is also masterful at keeping the reader guessing about who the true villan is up until the last possible minute.  The twist and turns truly keep coming up through the last page of the book, and only those that finish the book will understand the complete picture, even including the title of this review.      Only those that work in the encryption field or possibly those at NSA would likely know how accurate the information in this book is, but it doesn't really matter for the purposes of enjoying the read.  The topic is fun and challenging and lends to a faced paced thriller.  This book is possibly Brown's best.  More scientific than this religion based novels, the characters are more likely to have the capabilites to live up to the tasks written for them and it is easier to suspend disbelief and just enjoy the ride.
B00005RYLE|5.0|This movie has it all gore good scares laughter and completely insane. I have been obsessed with it since I started junior high I still watch it quite often and I was shocked how many people I found in school who loved it to. I will never get tired of it and it is a classic I don't care what any one says. <br />   With that let me say to Horrorman horror movies aren't meant to be F**ken Shakespeare they are meant to be fun silly and that's the way fans like em if you want serious Movies go watch Casablanca or Citizen Kane if ya want a few hours of good fun then watch this or something else of the like. I mean I find it strange you call yourself horrorman yet almost all your reviews are negative I think I speak for the majority of horror fans worldwide that you are a F**ken joke. I ain't no horror enthusiast and don't claim to be I am simply a fan buff. But I have a love and respect for these movies. that's my two cents

B00009Z576|5.0|John Anderson fans,beware: This was the only Yes record without his vocals. <br />His absence didn't disturb the consistency of the songs in no way. <br /> <br />His replacement was Trevor Horn, who would produce the band's eighties records. <br />Squire and Howe's backing vocals are notorious here; sometimes there are duets <br />between Squire and Horn (in Machine Messiah, Does it really happen and Run through the light, for instance) <br />Trevor's voice isn't impressive, it's normal. <br />The keyboardist was Geoff Downes.He's doesn't do that fast solos much ( with the exception of  <br />Machine Messiah and Tempus Fugit), he likes doing effects more.He's far from Rick Wakeman, but doesn't dissapoint. <br />Drama was Yes's last purely progressive album before they started  releasing something more commercial(great albums too). <br />I stranged John's absence in the beggining, but after repeated listens I concluded: <br />This cd is flawless, no filler. <br />As always, Chris Squire's bass continues with that distinctive sound and interesting. <br /> <br />Track 1- The most progressive(it has three parts), the start reminds Black Sabbath, catchy singings, <br />good melody. <br /> <br />Track 2- Semi instrumental, the keyboard fits with ecological nature and the sleeve (one of Roger Dean's best to me) <br /> <br />Track 3- One favourite, killer bass solos, cool keyboards(sound like xylophone in 4:19)  <br /> <br />Track 4- Good, but it was the piece that I delayed to like most.The title refers to the mind  <br />compared to a camera that \\"films\\" memories. <br /> <br />Track 5- The other favourite. We have that nature-esque keyboards again(beautiful). <br />I love its chorus and there is a synthetizer that imitates a bird in 2:26. <br />One curiosity: Trevor plays bass. <br /> <br />Track 6 - It has the fastest tempo and that evident Squire bass.The guitar here is melodic. <br />The lyrics seem like a band self advertisement (don't mix up). The singing ryhthm is creative. <br /> <br />Drama was superb, but Yes is more successful with John Anderson.   <br />90125 sellings proved it. <br />I have the version with no bonus tracks.I bought it before the re-release appeared. <br />

I'm so glad it is. I saw 'Serendipity' and loved every second of it! I can totally relate to it, or at the very least dream that something like this could really be possible for people anywhere.<br /><br />Two people meet who seem so perfect for each other, are put to the ultimate test. Is it really their destiny to be together or just a fleeting romantic attraction that was never really meant to be?<br /><br />To test fate and destiny, Jonathan (John Cusack) is persuaded by Sara (Kate Beckinsale), to write his phone number on a money note travelling from wallet and purse, in the hope of reaching her again. While Sara signs her name and address in the front page of one of Jonathan's favorite books and sells the book to a bookshop by her in the hope he'll find it one day and be in contact again.<br /><br />A pair of black cashmier gloves also take Jonathan and Sara's fancy - but are then split in two. One glove for each of them. Intended to spur each character on and never stop looking until they meet again and the pair of gloves match.<br /><br />John Cusack is an ideal lead, and Kate Beckingsale is absolutely ravishing in this sweet, time driven, life altering tale.<br /><br />One thing I noticed was they never asked each other what number each of them pressed in the lift. If they had I'm sure it would have been an even sweeter indication for them to decide if the time for them was right or wrong.<br /><br />Serendipity is a movie that gives me a lot of hope. It warms my heart against the snow and I'd want to skate and dance on the ice with someone I love. Pull them close to whisper in their ear, hold them close, and breath in the purfume on their neck. This movie is nothing short of wonderful! For anyone who appreciates a charming romantic tale. I'd love to live in a serendipity world!e in a serendipity world!
0066214122|4.0|In many ways Michael Crichton is to science fiction what Tom Clancy is to modern day thrillers. They follow a similar formula for each book; however they manage to fill it with enough pseudoscience to suspend your disbelief long enough to finish the story. Prey is identical to Crichton's past ventures. A small group of people, often scientists, are put in harm's way out of corporate greed and arrogance. Most of who are disposed of in graphic ways. Rather than dinosaurs, time travel, gorillas, or alien artifacts, Crichton's body bag fillers are micro-robots.  <br /> <br />Nobody reads thriller novels for their brilliant dialog and deep characters. In a way the novel works as an essay on how nano-technology could go horribly wrong. To that end it's very entertaining. Crichton is at his best when the poorly armed characters are facing a meticulously described foe. Crichton doesn't disappoint with idea of being stalked and devoured inside out by a swarm of machines for fuel. Add to that some paranoia about your fellow survivors and it makes for a great suspense story. <br /> <br />Unfortunately Prey doesn't feel as well told as the rest of Crichton's novels. The story is told in first person as the main character recounts the events of the last few days. The problem with this is that the character doesn't seem to realize what the reader already knows until near the end. The characters spend too much time bickering for the reader to feel any real sympathy towards them. Ultimately there are a few too many loose ends and nagging questions before the past page of the book. While it doesn't have to make perfect sense, it is fiction after all; it does have to justify the many odds and ends of the story for a satisfactory ending. Prey however it just ends with a minimum of wrap up. <br /> <br />Prey is worth what brief time it will take to read. If you enjoyed Crichton than you will likely enjoy Prey. I would recommend this book, though it admittedly isn't perfect.
0553579908|5.0|For this review, I'm including all the three of the books that have been released so far in the Song of Ice and Fire series. George RR Martin doesn't like to wrap up all the plotlines at the end of each book, so if you like the first one, you will definitely want the other two. The three books so far in the series read like one long narrative, and it is far from complete at the end of book three. <br /> <br />Most people put these books into the fantasy category, and to be fair, magic does play an increasingly important role as the story progresses, but these books are different from every other fantasy book I've ever read. The books are more like historical fiction except that their wonderfully vivid world is entirely made up. I'd almost put them in the sci-fi category if it weren't for the medieval setting. It is very much different from the traditional fantasy series. <br /> <br />A lot of people pick up these books expecting to get traditional fantasy novels, and wind up very disappointed. If you've read the entire Wheel of Time series, and are eagerly awaiting the next book, then this series may not be for you. Many people like fantasy books for the escape from reality that they provide. Evil is embodied in one dark villain, and you know that no matter how bad it seems, the heroes will come through and win in the end. I enjoy books like this from time to time, and I've read and enjoyed books from Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan, but George RR Martin is something else entirely. Comparing him to them is like comparing apples to oranges. <br /> <br />At times it seems like this series was written to be the antithesis of the \\"escape from reality\\" fantasy novel. There is no overarching \\"force of evil\\" in this series, and no real heroes either. The books are set in Feudal times, and there's a lot of feuding going on. There are good and bad people on all sides of the conflicts, and sometimes I'm not sure who I want to win. Looking back historically, medieval times were hard, and they made for hard people, and that is exactly what George RR Martin tries to portray in his books. I've read a few negative reviews of these books which say the characters are not believable, or are unrealistic. I must say that anyone who thinks that the world in these books lacks realism probably doesn't have a clear idea of what life was like in the Middle Ages. They need to put down the fantasy book they've been reading and spend a little time in the non-fiction section. <br /> <br />Some reviewers have compared these books to a great medieval soap opera, and I'd say that's a fairly accurate description. Imagine the HBO series \\"Deadwood\\" set in the middle ages, then add in a little more sex and violence, and cut down a bit on the cussing, and you will have a good idea of what to expect in these books. There are a lot of complicated characters struggling with each other, and you have no idea how it's all going to end up. I'm not at all sure that the series will ever be ended, but if it keeps up its current level of quality, I'll be there reading as many pages as he cares to churn out. <br /> <br />I'm not much of a finisher when it comes to books in series. I stopped at book 5 in the Sword of Truth series, and I thought it went downhill after book 2. I stopped in the middle of book 4 in the Wheel of Time series after I asked my friend what was going on in book 9, and I found out that not much had changed since book 4. I stopped at book 4 in the Dark Tower series after getting fed up with Stephen King recycling his old material into his new books. I will probably finish all of these series eventually, but it will only be because I can't find anything better to read. <br /> <br />The Song of Ice and Fire is the first series in a long time to really grab hold of me and keep me interested from start to finish. I love the realism in these books, and it brings in a whole new level of intensity when you're really not sure if this character is going to liveor die, and when you really don't know whether the Starks or Lannisters are going to win the next battle. The politics in the land of Westros is even more interesting than the battles. Who is allying with who? Who is going to be assassinated? Who's getting double-crossed? And then in the background, you have magic as the wildcard that throws carefully laid plans out the window, and the constant foreboding of the coming winter. <br /> <br />There was one point in the second book where I literally threw the book across the room and spent several minutes fuming and pacing around before I picked it up and continued reading. Those of you who read the book can probably guess the part I'm talking about. I've never had a book get me that worked up before or since, and I am eagerly awaiting the fourth book in the series. I hope it will be as good as the first three. <br /> <br />If you haven't yet read this book, I'd advise you to be a little wary when going through these reviews. There are a lot of spoilers, especially in the negative reviews, and I think you will enjoy the books much more if you let yourself be surprised by their twists and turns. There's a very helpful review by \\"Mister SJEM\\" which should be close to the top if you sort the reviews by \\"most helpful\\". It should give you a good idea if this book is for you without giving away too much of the plot.
B000002ILG|4.0|I personally think Big Game is a better album, but, White Lion holds one of the most underrated guitarist in Vito Bratta. Every single solo of his is marvellously crafted (if youre into guitar) His best solos are on \\"Wait\\" and \\"Hungry\\" Even though all his guitar work should be in a museum.    Its too bad not every track is strong, well, its hair metal.

B00006IU73|5.0|What exactly is the fascination with band names involving random animals these days? I don't have an answer for that, but I'll cut Porcupine Tree some slack since they've been around since 1991 and \\"In Absentia\\" is one of the best records I've heard in recent memory. <br /> <br />Beyond any allusions to prog-rock or prog-metal that could be made about this band, lies songs like \\"Lips of Ashes,\\" \\"Prodigal,\\" \\"Blackest Eyes\\" and \\"Trains,\\" each showcasing a band at the top of their game writing industrial-grade hooks that could bring down Godzilla. Prog without the apparent need to write lyrics about elves and eskimos, \\"In Absentia\\" combines the best of both worlds in its fusion of classic rock juggernauts like Pink Floyd and Black Sabbath with an unmistakably \\"alternative\\" feel, slipping between sparkling acoustic folk and crunchy power Sabbath guitar with a seamlessness that only foreshadows this album's \\"cult classic\\" status. <br /> <br />\\"Blackest Eyes\\" is the perfect opener: a very brief, chiming clean electric guitar signals the explosion of a brief, slamming guitar riff that segues right into one of the catchiest pop songs ever. \\"Trains\\" and \\"Lips of Ashes\\" follow, with the former's folky bent almost sounding like a '90s alternative take on something the Traveling Wilburys (a supergroup that included Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Tom Petty) might have come up with, while \\"Lips of Ashes\\" makes use of florid, ethereal sound effects and guitar work to create an unforgettable mood. Elsewhere, the simplicity of \\"Heartattack in a Layby\\" conjures up pure sadness. <br /> <br />Of course, not everything's sunshine and gumdrops. Where something like Metallica's \\"Orion\\" can hold up for over eight minutes and not seem dull or forced, Porcupine Tree's instrumental \\"Wedding Nails\\" starts with one of the worst Satriani riffs that Joe didn't even write; nothing can really save it in six minutes and thirty-three seconds after this, although the song does move throughseveral phases ranging from blistering to almost atmospheric and Middle Eastern. <br /> <br />Still, it's hard to stress what a breath of fresh air this album is in today's music world. Real melody, real thought, real good. Pick it up, and if you don't love it, give it to me so I can find someone with taste who will.

B00005JNSK|5.0|Many years ago, Charlie Button's grandfather worked for Willy Wonka's Choclate Factory.  Their chocolates were amazing.  Seemed like Wonka could invent candy other folks just dreamed of making---like ice cream that never melted even on the hottest day.  So amazing, in fact, that a good many of the employees performed industrial espionage.  Soon, Wonka's competitors were offering no-melt ice cream and gum that didn't lose its flavor.     Willy could have no idea that at least one or two of his competitors could steal in no time flat.    Sadly, Willy Wonka closed the door on the factory and let all his employees go.  No one's been in there since, but the choclate keeps pouring out.     In an unprecedented move, Willy offers five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars.  The children who win these five tickets get to visit the chocolate factory for a day--and one will come away with an unheard of prize:  which Willy will not list!      Charlie badly wants to win the prize, both for himself and his grandfather.  But, how does poor Charlie stand a chance if he only gets one bar of chocolate per year---on his birthday.      Meanwhile, kids are finding the Golden Tickets.  First, there's a fat German kid who eats chocolate all the time.  Then, there's a spoilt British girl whose industrialist father buys her hundreds of thousands of chocolate bars just so she can get the one.  Then, a kid hacker from Colorado who pegs the system and knows just which bar to buy.  Finally, the world's champion gum chewer and her stage mom win.      They're down to one.  Charlie finds a dollar in the snow and gets the last ticket.      The next day is the tour of the chocolate factory.  Wonka, the five kids and their respective parents go on an amazing tour where they discover that a tiny race of people--the oompah loompahs--are who now work at the factory creating choclates.  Throughout the tour, each of the children is tested---til only one remains.      The effects in this film are pretty amazing.  I will admit I wasn't certain Depp could pull the role off, but he did.  He's a somewhat more disociated Wonka than Gene Wilder, but still interesting.  Overall, a very enjoyable film and a sweet deal for both the young and the young at heart.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Its hard to say this is a remake, for Tim Burton has twisted this story into a mind of its own. Johnny Depp is superb as the rather odd chocolate inventor, who's childhood was less then perfect and adult life surrounded by an atmosphere children can only dream of.<br /><br />Yes I say childhood, for Burton has given us a look behind the story of Wonka, his father being a dentist who on one halloween threw all of Willy's precious, gathered candy into a fire. Being afraid of the cavities and other trouble sweets bring. Sound dumb? Not at all. Wonka has in consiquence grown up with a twisted idea of how families are, and has a hard time being around parents, even saying the word is torturous for the candy man.<br /><br />Other than that, this remake has run even closer to the book, Veronica being thrown down the garabge shoot by the squarrels instead of trying to get the goose that laid chocolate eggs. Even the Oompa Loompas have undergone changes, and in turn are hipper, wilder and smaller then before.<br /><br />The landscape is very Tim Burtonesque, in the beginning of the movie, its not hard to guess who's the director (If you already didn't know) For the coloring is dark, and the Buckets house has a decided scrunched look, and tilts to the right in a way only Tim Burton could make it tilt without completely falling.<br /><br />I can't quite say though its a movie to take you're children to. With Willy Wonka licking Bug blood of his Machete, to an Oompa Loompa trying to stab Mike Tv, to dolls catching on fire and dying horrible plastic melting deaths. Other than that, apart from the adult moments and understanding of the film, children might enjoy it.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I had only seen one other movie of Hayao Miyazaki, \\"Spirited Away\\". I fell in love with that movie, so my friend recommended me to watch \\"Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind\\". After watching Nausicaa, I am glad to say that my admiration for Hayao Miyazaki's movies has only become stronger. <br /> <br />The story is about Nausicaa, the princess of the Valley of the Wind. The human civilization is near extinction, because there is a toxic plague spreading in the air, killing everyone. These poisonous fumes come from the spores, which are protected by giant insects called \\"Ohms\\". The villagers of the Valley of the Wind are safe since the air of their land is protected from this poison. Nausicaa, the fun, loyal and courageous princess of the Valley of the Wind, feels that everything can be solved without resolving to violence, and tries to find a cure to this poison. However, as their land is invaded from Tolmekians, who feel that they have another solution to saving the human race, even if it resorts to bloodshed, it is up to Nausicaa to save the people, even if it means putting her own life on hand. <br /> <br />While this movie starts off with a simple storyline (a girl trying to find a cure for the fumes of the sea of decay), it slowly introduces more characters along with more plot lines, making it an adventurous rollercoaster ride for the viewer. We get to see how people turn against one another during hardship, how things are not always what they seem, along with a girl who shows courage, bravery, trying to spread peace and love by ending a war, convincing people, while risking her own life in the process. It is clear to see that Miyazaki's imagination is flowing throughout this movie. We get to see new gadgets, a new world, with strange looking creatures, as well as a steady storyline to keep us focused. <br /> <br />I am surprised at the wonderful quality of this DVD. When I saw this movie, I had no idea it was a 1984 movie until I came online to write this review. There is an audio track to listen to the movie in Japanese as well as in English. Along with this, we also get to see original trailers, and two featurettes of the movie: Behind the scenes of the English voice recording, where they interviewed the cast of the English version of the movie (such as Patrick Stewart and Uma Thurman), as well as a \\"Birth of Studio Ghibli\\" featurette, where, being a newbie to Miyazaki's movies, I learnt a lot about Miyazaki's works in a chronological fashion.  <br /> <br />This is a wonderful movie that a person of any age will enjoy watching. Therefore, I recommend you to get the movie and watch it, because you will not be disappointed.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have a piece of advice for those who don't like this album.  But, before I give you my good advice, let me take one guess: you listened to it once or twice, and dismissed it out of hand.  Now I want you to get your CD player and a good set of headphones, go into a dark room with no distractions, and listen to the following songs in the following order, at a healthy volume (and don't try to compare anything to U2 or Radiohead):    1.  Square One  2.  White Shadows  3.  Speed of Sound  4.  A Message  5.  Low    Now listen to them again twice more, still in this order.  If you still don't like what you've heard, then you're simply much different than me, and I can't help you.  I think that even if the rest of the album were mediocre, which it isn't, the above list would elevate \\"X&Y\\" to classic status.    While these are my favorite songs on \\"X&Y,\\" other gems, in my opinion, include \\"What If,\\" \\"Fix You,\\" \\"Talk,\\" the second half of both \\"Swallowed in The Sea\\" and \\"Twisted Logic\\" (it takes a little time for these two songs to get going), and the uncredited 13th song -- which has sort of a Johnny Cash/ bluegrass feel.  Now it's true that Chris Martin's out-of-tune falsetto voice can begin to grate on the slower tracks, but I believe he's trying to convey vulnerability.  In fact, the theme of the album seems to be that if you're down and confused (no, don't \\"love the one you're with\\") you can be assured that Chris Martin and gang have experienced similar feelings, and will try their best to cheer you up and let you know that you're not the only one with these feelings (or \\"fix you,\\" if you will).  For example, from \\"Square One\\": \\"Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too?\\"  From \\"White Shadows\\": \\"If you've ever felt like something's missing, things you never understand, little white shadows sparkle and glisten, pat of a system, a plan.\\"  From \\"Fix you\\": \\"Tears stream down your face and I ... will try to fix you.\\"  From \\"Talk\\": \\"Are you lost or incomplete, do you feel like a puzzle, you can't find your missing piece, tell me how you feel.\\"  From \\"A Message\\": \\"You don't have to be alone ... you don't have to be on your own.\\"  From \\"Low\\": \\"You see no meaning to your life; you should try.\\"    One element that's so compelling about \\"X&Y,\\" is the complex, textured instrumentation.  In tracks like \\"Square One,\\" Coldplay creates their signature \\"wall of sound\\" to propel the song after Martin sings the first stanza (\\"You're in control is there anywhere you want to go ...\\").  Same with the chorus in \\"A Message.\\"  In several songs including \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Low,\\" I count at least seven instruments: lead and acoustic guitar, piano, organ (some parts of this album sound downright churchlike), bass, drum, and miscellaneous percussion.  Each member of the band shows more proficiency at their respective instruments than in the past.    Yeah, maybe Martin reverts too often to that sometimes cloying falsetto on the slower tracks.  But trust me on this, \\"X&Y\\" is a superb album, one for the ages.  U2 and Radiohead comparisons are certainly valid, but these are not exactly bad bands to emulate.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Until this movie came out, I had never seen an anime cartoon in my life. Even when the movie released in the theatres I didn't pay much attention to it. In 2003, I was watching the Oscars, and I discovered this movie won an award for the best animated feature. Curious to find out more about this movie, I decided to rent it and take a look at it. After watching \\"Spirited Away\\", I was in complete awe. This was one of the best animated movies that I had even seen! <br /> <br />\\"Spirited Away\\" is the story about a young girl Chihiro, who is moving to a new home with her parents. However, her father takes a `short-cut' during the trip, and somehow they end up in an abandoned theme park. While strolling through the park, Chihiro's parents smell something delicious, and find out that the restaurants in the parks are filled with mouth-watering food. They start gobbling up the food, while Chihiro gets worried, thinking that they are in big trouble. Soon the weather starts changing and Chihiro starts seeing apparitions walking around the park. Terrified, Chihiro runs to her parents to get out of the place, but is horrified to see that they have turned into pigs. She soon finds that she is now in a completely different world where the spirits walk the Earth, and through the help of her new found friend Haku, she has to survive in this strange land.  <br /> <br />The main reasons why I liked this movie is because of: <br /> <br />i) (M)iyazaki's wonderful story: I would have never been introduced to watching Miyazaki's other movies if I had not seen this. <br />ii) (A)dventure: From cleaning the stinking River God, and taking care of `No Face', to her train journey in the end, this movie was filled with excitement and adventure. <br />iii) (G)reat Story: In a way, this movie is like `Alice in Wonderland'. Both the movies talk about a depressed and bored girl, who is suddenly transported into this strange fantasy world, where everything is different, and tries to find their wayback. However, even though there are some similarities, I wouldn't call one a copy of another, because `Spirited Away' has a completely different charm to it, and is unique in its own way. <br />iv) (I)ntrigue: The story of this movie is very surreal, revolving around strange and mysterious characters (such as No Face) that keep us entertained. <br />v) (C)olorful: The animation for this movie is wonderful. It is like a breath of fresh air from other animated movies. <br />vi) (A)dequate Translation: I saw the English version of the movie, and didn't find it too bad. Daveigh Chase did a good job of giving voice to Chihiro, as did Suzanne Pleshette, Susan Egan and Jason Marsden for the other characters <br />vii) (L)ovely Background Score: Music plays an integral part in any movie, and the score for this movie is amazing.  <br /> <br />The first letter of the above 7 points describes the whole movie in one word: MAGICAL (which it is). Therefore, for those who have not seen this movie as of yet, get it now and see it!
B000A59PMO|5.0|I really had doubts about this show, but a trusted friend talked me into watching it for the first time. I was hooked. The writing is superb. The twists, plots, subplots and characterizations are all far beyond the standards for television today. The characters are fun to love, fun to hate and fun to wonder if they are good or bad. I think Rob Thomas is a genius. In a televisionland that is inundated with the stupidity of reality tv, this is a breath of fresh air. Well worth the money to buy the DVD set and well worth your time to watch.
B000935UFS|4.0|As with any new release by an artist I'm a fan of, it can take a few sessions to get over the initial strange, yet familiar sounds, and appreciate something new.  With this release, I didn't find the first hook until \\"Only\\" (8).  From here on in, the album seems to find it's feet, and I usually start playing the album from here, then let it cycle back to track 1 and continue through.<br /><br />\\"Getting Smaller\\" (9) would normally not be in my musical taste gamut, but I always tend to nudge the volume control up for this track.  I blame the rocking guitar riff, and taut beats.<br /><br />\\"Sunspots\\" (10) tricks me every time.  My immediate instinct when hearing the languid start is to skip, but then I remember that as soon as the intro is over, this is a very strong track.<br /><br />\\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" (11) serves as a filler track for me.  For some reason I can't get excited by this, even though there are some solid chord progressions and a melody that sounds like it should work, the overall package of the track lets it down slightly.<br /><br />\\"Beside You In Time\\" (12) starts off by building up to something.  There is anticipation there for a great climax, and half way through irritation creeps in.  Another two minutes of building, then the track finishes without this resolution.  If music is like sex to you, you'll need a cold shower after this one.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" (14 - the bonus track on this release) sounds like it should be part of the album proper, and in fact, on the vinyl release, it is.  A strong finishing track, and those without this bonus have missed out.<br /><br />\\"All The Love in the World\\" (1) is an ideal opener and sets the scene for the rest of the album well.<br /><br />\\"You Know What You Are\\" (2) is a little too noisy for me.  Maybe I just like my \\"industrial rock\\" a little lighter...<br /><br />The first single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" (4) is probably the most commercial track on the album, so it's easy to see why it was released first.  I have to say that my first listen (before the album) disappointed me a bit, but I'm growing to like it the more I listen to it.<br /><br />\\"Every Day Is Exactly The Same\\" (6) is probably the best track from the first half of the album, with the chorus and climax being classic NIN.<br /><br />The title track \\"With Teeth\\" (7) is not a bad track, and serves well as a bridge between the two halves.<br /><br />The album certainly evokes memories of earlier albums, but I feel that it's not too derivative and is more a variation on Trent's signature.  I think the thing that is missing here is Charlie Clouser.  Clouser's skill at creating complex, layered, but not overbearing soundscapes is what makes previous albums seem superior.  There are always tracks that appeal more than others, but I think it's Clouser's absence that makes this a 4 star album.<br /><br />I can't wait until the remix album is released.released first.

B00005JNSK|1.0|The first 40 or so minutes of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" are very good.  The relationships between Charlie and his family are well established, and the spoiled kids are introduced pretty decently.  However, once the movie hits the chocolate factory, all hell breaks loose, for the audience as well as the characters.  Johnny Depp is totally miscast as Wonka, and seems to act as if he's in a bubble.  Not once do we ever believe he is capable of being a chocolate making genius.  He plays the role as if he's a cross between Michael Jackson and a 17th century dandy of the French court.  As for the kids, I couldn't help feeling that the sad state of our times made me look at the spoiled kids' behavior as normative and Charlie's pious behavior as the aberration.  Most of the Oompa Loompa's MTV rock commentaries were incoherent and the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood were unnecessary.  Most of all, this movie replaced charm with style and warmth with slick computerized glossiness.  Stick with the book(s) and the 1971 original.
B0007Y08T2|5.0|Without a doubt, Dark Tranquillity is the leading band in the metal front today. And if you're just discovering this for yourself, now is a good time to go back and check out their earlier releases. The high points of The Gallery (and there are lots of them) have been covered several times in other reviews, so I won't get into that. But the added bonus to this edition of this great album is the cover tunes. Yet there is a clear error in Amazon's album description. The tune 'Lady In Black' is actually a Mercyful Fate cover, which was obviously mismatched with Queensryche's 'The Lady Wore Black'. All 5 covers are executed wonderfully, from finding that pounding, grindy thrash sound of Kreator, to capturing the moody feel of Metallica, Dark Tranquillity show their artistic abilities even when performing the material of other groups. Which is a great bonus to an already outstanding album.
B0001I561E|1.0|I was very excited when this classic was finally released on DVD. It seemed like forever for this to happen. I took it home and popped it into my player and after the initial dubbing of the opening song, the disc began skipping! It seemed to be not very obvious to one who had never seen the movie before. I seen this great work when it initially came out in the theater. It was my first Disney movie of my adult life. <br /> <br />I took it back to my retailer the next day for an exchange. The same thing happened 3 times! I was not happy with the special features as well! C'mon, Clay Aiken. Someone must have made a grave error! I eventually gave up trying to get a playable copy and sold this irreparable copy to a video resale agent.  Maybe someday in the future Disney will relese a Brand New, Fully Restored, Special Original Edition. <br /> <br />Has the studio become shameful of its previous work that it smears one of its best titles? I am really afraid what they are planning to do with my all time favorite-The Little Mermaid! In Other words dont tamper with Greatness! <br />
B00006LLNU|5.0|Writing about Sigur Ros is probably one of the hardest thing a critic ever has to face. Their music is so unique that finding words that describe air are hard to come by. <br /> <br />Some people may never understand the beauty that is Sigur Ros; as some people will never understand the beauty of a darkened winter night sky lit up with distant galaxies. <br /> <br />It's as though all the songs are touched by a bit of magic, and that doesn't happen very often. This album dares. It is bold. It is not afraid, and at the same time it seems fragile and delicate. <br /> <br />This album has new emotions for SIGUR ROS--sadness, even full-blown rage at the end of Track 8. The first group of four songs is closer to the old SIGUR ROS, more delicately beautiful, and while mournful at times, also uplifting. Track 2/Track 3 are the perfect examples of this, especially Track 3, which is a pure instrumental (no singing at all), with a gorgeous piano sequence. It's one part elegy, one part celebration. For all its sadness, it slowly builds up an amazing amount of power, and even as it dies away, you can't help that remaining sense of lingering joy. It is achingly bittersweet. <br /> <br />Over the second half of ( ), SIGUR ROS moves into its new emotional territory. Discord, heavy, brooding arrangements, and much more anguished, sometimes bitter vocals set this section apart. I appreciate the Hammond organ, which becomes more prominent on the second half of the album. Track 5 in particular shows them off well. <br /> <br />You have to be patient to listen to ( )as the songs build very gradually to a crescendo that does not always come. Track 7 moves closer to bitterness--and then there is the explosion in Track 8. At first it sounds like it will be a triumphant closing anthem and then--WHAM! I've heard few better expressions of such blinding anger...it's actually stronger because it has no recognizeable words. Rather than a momentary and someday laughable teenage-angsty outburst,this is an expression of pure emotion itself. That is why I can appreciate it so much as SIGUR ROS explodes into rage with JONSI's chilling voice hovering over the chaos. <br /> <br />There is no easy way to put it, they aren't immediately an accessible sound, ( ) is darker then gtis Byrjun. Sigur Rs puts considerable energy into generating original compositions that I feel draws their power from emotion generated through the music and vocals, rather then the music itself. This could spell danger for impatient or shallow listeners, it takes more then a few listens to really get into ( )

0393976149|5.0|I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.<br /><br />Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.<br /><br />Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.<br /><br />Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.<br /><br />Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition. A truly compelling and wise novel!<br /><br />Anne K. Phillips, associate professor of English and assistant head of the English department at Kansas State University, is co-editor of the Norton Critical Edition of \\"Little Women\\" and \\"The Louisa May Alcott Encyclopedia,\\" along with Gregory Eiselein, professor and director of graduate studies in English at Kansas State.<br /><br />Phillips was awarded a University Small Research Grant in January 2002 to examine the first editions of \\"Little Women\\" at the Houghton Library at Harvard University, in connection with the development of the Norton Critical Edition.<br /><br />This edition also provides the authoritative, accurate text of the first edition (1868-69) of \\"Little Women,\\" accompanied by textual variants and explanatory annotations. Backgrounds and Contexts\\" includes a wealth of archival materials, among them previously unpublished correspondence and Alcott's own precursors to the novel. Twenty nineteenth-century reviews provide critiques and seven modern essays represent a variety of critical theories used to read and study the novel. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.<br /><br />This is an outstanding edition and the additional academic information makes for richer reading and study. The editing is first-rate and each edition is printed on acid-free paper. Makes a wonderful addition to any library.<br /><br />JANAccurate text of the first edition (1868-69) of \\"Little Women,\\" accompanied by textual variants and explanatory annotations.

B0000C8AVM|5.0|Reviewer Da Peace Dogg needs to be told something very simple: there WAS music released before the 19 freaking 90's!!! What do you think your parents listened to? Rocks being banged together??? So if you think that this is a new album, as your review says, you are  WRONG! This was released in 1975!! 31 years ago! Get your facts straight before you right a review.<br />Anyway, this is my favorite Dylan album, and one of the best ever. Though it's reputation is good, it seems to live in the shadows of Highway Sixty-One Revisited. Highway is a good album, but I give the edge to Blood on the Tracks. This also shows Dylan at his most creative as a narrator. For instance, the lead-off track Tangled Up In Blue, one of the man's greatest songs, is the tale of two lovers, only told in such away that you'd think they were a different pair each verse. No one, not even Dylan, had ever written a song like that before. Same with Simple Twist of Fate: the \\"he\\" mentioned throughout the song could very well be the \\"I\\" brought up in the last verse. Again, no one else had done this before. One last thing on narration: Shelter from the Storm retells the death and resurrection of Jesus, or at least if Jesus was the Common Man. And he turns what some call the Greatest Story Ever Told into one of the best songs ever made.<br />As for the rest, this was recorded while Dylan was going through his much-publicized divorce with Sarah Lowndes. So the songs have a good mix of emotion. Idiot Wind, his greatest putdown since Positively 4th Street, maybe even Like a Rolling Stone, must've made his intended  targets (one of which was probably Sarah, but there's more) go into hiding as soon as they heard it. Eight minutes of all the rage you can squeeze into eight minutes plus a bit more. Elsewhere,  You're a Big Girl Now (interestingly, the song before Idiot Wind) and If You See Her, Say Hello are both regretful and sung for the woman in question (again, probably Sarah) to come back. Buckets of Rain and You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go are both sad songs, but they seem so happy you wouldn't recognize it, the latter showing that Dylan was good at the art of finger-picking. Meet Me In the Morning would be the only electric song, and even then there's an acoustic guitar laying down the basic melody. Lastly, every Dylan album needs a rambling narritave, and Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts fits the bill, though it lacks a bridge and goes on a bit too long.'re Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go are both sad songs, but they seem so happy you wouldn't recognize it, the latter showing that Dylan was good at the art of finger-picking.

0974872407|4.0|Reading \\"The Shadow Of The Wind\\" was both a delight and a disappointment. This novel had the potential to be excellent literary fiction. At times Carlos Ruiz Zafon's writing reminded me of both Gabriel Garcia Marquez's and Jorge Luis Borges' work. My expectations rose dramatically as I began to hope for more than a good read. Instead of great literature, however, the novel became an overlong and predictable bestseller, with a most original premise, some brilliant passages and many flaws.<br /><br />Sr. Ruiz Zafon's extraordinary idea of creating a Cemetery of Forgotten Books, a labyrinthine library where each book awaits someone to choose it and give it another chance to live by making it part of the new owner's life, gave me chills. There existed a possibility, as I read the first chapters, that I might be able to list this as one of my favorite works of fiction. Unfortunately, my disappointment when reaching the novel's conclusion overshadowed the book's many positive elements.<br /><br />Daniel Sempere is a young boy who fears he has forgotten the image of his dead mother's face. His compassionate father, an antiquarian book dealer, introduces him to the book cemetery. Daniel and Sr. Sempere are both memorable and unusual characters, as are many of Ruiz Zafon's other figures. Fermin, a former Republican agent who becomes a second father to Daniel, and Julian Carax, the author of the book Daniel selects, are both extraordinary men. Daniel's choice of books ultimately determines the course of his life, as he tries to discover if the author is still alive and solve the multitude of mysteries surrounding him.<br /><br />The setting, post-WWII Barcelona, is fascinating and Zafon depicts a brooding city in mourning as a result of the atrocities of both civil and world wars. The rich plot and various subplots, filled with passion, obsession and revenge, have such potential but become terribly convoluted and lose coherence at times. There is much too much information given about some of the characters, their rationales, and oddly enough, about an ancient, haunted house. Much of the mysterious ambiance is lost as a result of all the unwieldy description. Here, the concept \\"less is more\\" would have strongly improved the narrative. The entire novel could have been cut by a third, perhaps, and made a better, tighter book without losing any of the story or character development. I am a big fan of long, juicy novels, but the length should have a purpose and enhance the tale. The author has focused more on the melodramatic rather than the literary elements. Some may not care, as this is an excellent read. I did care though, as I see so much more potential here and hope the author lives up to it next time.<br /><br />I do recommend \\"The Shadow Of The Wind.\\" Most will find it highly enjoyable, as did I.

B000001FQQ|5.0|i give \\"hot in the shade\\" 5 stars cos' i always thought this was a pretty good album. it's obvious that most who wrote a review for this album, really didn't think it was that great but, that's their opinion. i think it really showed growth in their song writing at the same time it displayed the kiss (80's) formula with the hit's \\"rise to it\\" \\"forever\\" & \\"hide your heart\\". there are some other pretty good track's on here too such as \\"prisoner of love\\" \\"silver spoon\\" & \\"loves a slap in the face\\" etc. the only problem i see is, when they re-mastered the kiss catalog, for some oddball reason, they stopped at the album before this \\"crazy nights\\". so hey mercury/polygram.. what's the hold up? finish the damm kiss catalog where you left off at, starting with this album.
B000777J2S|5.0|I just wanted to say that this album - the artist and the real genuine production - deserves not less than five stars and who low-rated it should be more musically educated before saying bulls..t! It has it all: overall great feeling, smoothly structured songs, clever and cristal clear arrangements (notice some interesting odd-tempo battutas), great talented musicians, drama and passion, top style vocal performance, nice cameos of Rufus Wainwright, Boy George et Al. Who needs more? <br />I'm sure Antony will deliver a lot of new great works in the future. Thanks -- Marco.
B000088E6D|5.0|Even though his songs are covers, Buble has open a space for young people to have access to songs that are timeless and that for some seem un-cool. Some think that he insults or destroys this type of music, but in my opinion his attempt to bring back this music is a total success. At least we are seeing a young singer that doesn't follow the trend of the bubble gum generation...And finally is so refreshing to hear someone that can really sing and that does not fake it...

B0009A1AS2|5.0|Let me review song by song first: <br /> <br />1 - The Root Of All Evil : The old-school DT song of the disc. Petrucci's riffs and wawas of the second half of the song and Rudess's piano finale are incredible. <br />2 - The Answer Lies Within : One of the ballads of the disc, pretty good, the \\"You're gonna shine\\" part has a lot of Beatle influence, like Ana Lee from Falling into Infinity. <br />3 - These Walls : Great song, power and melodic lines fusion together to bring us an incredible product. Petrucci's solo, of a simple and beautiful melody, breaks the chaos to bring a little light to the main theme. <br />4 - I Walk Beside You : The love song. Reminds a lot to U2, cause of the guitar arpeggios and the drums rhythms. But the beginning and end of the song are pure DT. <br />5 - Panic Attack : One of the best songs of the disc. The beginning make your heart start pumping adrenaline to your system. It really generates a panic attack. The Muse and Radiohead influence are undeniable. <br />6 - Never Enough : Great song. Very Muse-inspirited. The filter on the voice, the electronic keyboard melodies and the guitar distortions are great. <br />7 - Sacrificed Sons : The political song of the disc. From the musical point, the best of the song starts 4 minutes late, where the entire bands shows why they are the best. <br />8 - Octavarium : What can I say about the best song of the disc. Let me quote the Genesis. \\"At the beginning was dark, then appear DT to bring us light!!\\" An amazing song. It starts with a fusion between Pink Floyd and Yes. The acoustic guitar sounds great! The 5 different parts in which the songs divides are individual pieces of art. If you listen, at the end of the track, a flute plays the \\"leit motive\\" of the entire 24 minutes-long song. <br /> <br />What can I say about the entire album? EVOLUTION ...only that. Perhaps to people that got trap on DT firsts albums like Images and Word or Awake, this kind of change is too drastic, but remember that DT like a progressive band it is, with metal and non-metal influences, the taste of his music is in \\"the change\\". I'm sure that a lot of Beatles fans feel disappointed when Sergeant Pepper's came out. <br />

His character in that movie, the charismatic but terrifyingly cold leader of a gang of skinheads, is the polar opposite of the one he plays here in Gladiator. <br /> <br />The soundtrack, insipid vocals, is so bad it nearly ruined the movie for me.  What starts out embarrassingly out of place, by climax just grates.  Scott managed to get competent innovative sound out of Vangelis for Blade Runner, so what's up here?   <br /> <br />
B00004U8JV|4.0|Jurassic Park is one of  my all time favorite movies so it would be hard for The Lost World to measure up. However, taken on its own merits, LW is a good action movie. Jeff Goldblum is back as Ian Malcolm and finds out there is a Site B, a different island where the dinos were bred. he also finds out his girlfriend has gone down to the island to study them. Malcolm goes down to bring her home before she is eaten. While there, another group from Ingen arrive to hunt and capture as many species of dinosaurs as they can to turn them into a travleing sideshow.    Once again the effects are tremendous and I don't really understand some people's complaints that the story isn't good. I didn't see anything wrong with the basic concept. It's not as good as the first movie becaue you don't have Sam Neill and Laura Dern and you don't have that same awe as the first time you laid eyes on the dinosaurs trying to put yourself in the place of the paleontologists. I think all in all though that this was a strong sequel and an enjoyable movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|Look... I've been a fan of this band since I was knee high to a H.S. Senior... a.k.a. a Freshman.  Class of '95 WHAT?!?!?  Sorry for that.  Beyond the crass shout outs and all, I just wanted to say that this is one of the few albums of our generation that can be played from beginning to end, without a single track being skipped.  That alone says something.  If there is anyone under 25 reading this who does not already know, please pick this up.  You will more than likely be happy with your purchase... the only hard part will be getting tickets to PJ concerts in the future.
B00003CXXS|3.0|JP III is a solid action movie with a thin script and more great effects. It was also good to see Sam Neill back as Alan Grant. Dr. Grant is paid by a wealthy couple to join them in a flyover of the island from The Lost World and act as a tour guide. He reluctantly agrees and takes his assistant with him. The couple has lied to him however. They are actually going on a rescue mission. Their 12-year old son was parasailing with his mother's new boyfriend when there was an accident and they crash landed on the island. <br /> <br />There are a few new dinosaurs which make this movie interesting. The Spinosaur, who is bigger and meaner than the T Rex (and in fact takes down a Rex in a great fight sequence) and pterodons who look great gliding through the air. Good parts of the script are the action scenes especially with the Spinosaur and some good humor. Bad parts are that William H. Macy and Tea Leoni are irritating as the divorced couple and the fact that they survive until the end is hard to believe. Harder to believe is that the 12 year old son survives for 8 weeks by himself. The rescue party was down two members ten minutes after landing.  <br /> <br />Ignore the script holes and watch the dinosaurs. This is still a pretty good movie.
0812550706|1.0|Incredible schlock, that is. Totally without merit. <br /> <br />I soldiered on to the end, hoping for some redeeming feature, and found none. <br /> <br />Tiresome, repititious nonsense.  <br /> <br />And, to my amazement, several thousand Amazonians found it significant literature. <br /> <br />But, then, Harry Potter never made any sense to me,either. <br /> <br />So sorry.
0316776963|4.0|I can't decide how to rate this book using Amazon's system. 3 stars seems too low and 4 seems a little too high. This is the first Sedaris book I have read so I can't compare it to his other work. This is a series of autobiographical essays that are well written and driven by a sharp, multi-hued wit. It starts off with a great story of how Sedaris quietly fought a speech therapist who was trying to teach him not to lisp by avoiding all words with an 's' in them. One of my favorite lines in the book is when instead of saying 'rivers' he says 'many a river'. The strongest group of essays for me were when he went to live in Paris and took classes to learn how to speek French and quickly learned words and phrases that would never do him any good like 'facial swelling' and 'ashtray'. These essays provided most of the laugh out loud moments. <br /> <br />Not every essay is funny. A few were tedious and others just sat there begging to be skipped over. Sedaris is a very funny writer. I wouldn't call this book hilarious as others have, but humor may be the most subjective of the art forms.
0060090367|3.0|I really enjoyed the insight into an Irish family and it was pretty funny at times.  Like other reviewers, what bothered me was that I didn't like Claire that much.  I found it hard to care what happened to her.  She never said what she felt which got tiring and it seemed like she didn't even really know her husband.  Almost felt like the way a single person would imagine marriage as opposed to the way it is, but maybe that was the point...
B0002Y69NG|2.0|When I first saw The Matrix, I was thrilled by the action sequences and over the top explanations. The story however, is too detailed and confusing. It seems like the Wachowski brothers were trying to show off the intelligence by creating a sci-fi fantasy filled with technological set pieces and dialogue revised using a thesauras to make it sound \\"more intelligent.\\" OK so the film scores points for being entertaining to watch but it's too eccentric to be believable unless of course you're a 10 year old kid. The Wachowski brothers are better off making cartoons than movies. Their so called \\"art\\" are more geared to kids than adults I'm afraid.    The cast is also very mediocre. No one is capable of pulling of a memorable performance. Keanu Reeves doesn't have the charisma or rugged quality to play a character born of prophecy who eventually ends up saving the world by sacrificing his own life. The main villain in this movie is equally dull. I cannot help but laugh at how pathetic he is. One thing I should mention is that whenever these characters are \\"in the matrix\\" they always wear sun glasses. I guess thats one way of masking poor acting in a movie. Whats with those sun glasses anyway? Furthermore, Carrie Ann Moss drifts from being a caring, loving character into a leather dressed Ninja girl. I'm just wondering just how much testosterone did she inject on herself to pull that off. Morpheus is perhaps the worse character in the movie. I'm still puzzled as to why he has so much faith in \\"the one\\" and the fact that he is supposedly the most respected and wisest of the bunch. Sometimes the coldness portrayed in his character may seem like he is in control and calm but in fact his character is just poorly acted and I'm not going to go into how crappy his dialogue is.    Whats lacking in all these characters is some history. More character development would've been better placed in the first act and all or most of the action left in the 2nd and 3rd act. The love story isalso poorly written. At some point in the first movie Neo and Trinity just fall for each other. Was it love at first sight or is it more lust than love? Lets just all salivate in excitement at how romantic and moving the scene was when Neo brought her back to life. What nonsense! Practically none of the story points make sense. What has the matrix got to do with the real world and aren't the machines out on a quest to destroy humanity? So why did they accept Neo's proposal? The story is just not well thought out. I hope the ending does not signify another Matrix trilogy sequel. I know these movies made a lot of money but it would be ludicrous to explain this story even more. I must admit I was intrigued with it at first but lost interest later.    Special effects wise the movie does not deliver very well. I'm not really bothered with that but most of this movie looks more like a dream or a nightmare than reality. Sometimes I wonder whether we'll see Neo wake up and realise that this was all a dream at the end.     Overall this trilogy just doesn't do it for me. Computer geeks and nerds will love this trilogy for it's computer gizmos and action sequences. This movie is a movie for nerds much like Star Trek but at least the latter \\"feels\\" more sci-fi'sh.     Regarding the DVD set, hardcore fans will love this. It has tons of bonus features and extras. If you're not a fan or merely just adding this to your collection, then it I'd suggest you look for another box set.
B000001ESP|5.0|After finally breaking through to the masses with their previous album Permanent Waves, Rush released Moving Pictures in 1981. The band had a lot to live up to as Permanent Waves reached #3 on the U.S. charts and spawned the hit singles and now album rock standards \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"Freewill.\\" Moving Pictures would not only become the band's most successful release but also be progressive rock's finest hour. The strong material presented here, particularly on the album's first half, would cement the band as one of the greatest rock bands of all time.<br /><br />There is no album recorded in rock history with a stronger first half than Moving Pictures. \\"Tom Sawyer\\" would become the band's most famous song combining one of Geddy Lee's best vocal performances as well as Alex Lifeson's most memorable solos. The riff is immediately recognizable just like their track \\"The Spirit Of Radio\\" and Neil Peart's drumming is impressive throughout. A landmark in classic rock. The driving \\"Red Barchetta\\" is one of their most memorable tracks and features both Lee's impressive bass playing and vocals. The song is exciting throughout, particularly near the end when Peart throws in some wicked fills and Lee's voice matching the track's emotion. \\"YYZ\\" is the band's most endearing instrumental, so much so that many of their fans sing it note for note when they play it live. It's certainly one of the most famous instrumentals of the classic rock era. \\"Limelight\\", another hit single, is the most melodic track and is probably their second most enduring song after \\"Tom Sawyer.\\" All told, the first half is as good as it gets in rock music.<br /><br />And the second half is nearly as impressive. \\"The Camera Eye\\" would be the last epic track they'd ever record and is among their best. The song itself provides the perfect bridge to their future releases. It's the last of their studio tracks to pass the 10-minute mark and it's heavy emphasis on keyboards would pave the way for their future '80s albums. \\"Witch Hunt\\" is the darkest track here and starts out with a heavy riff from Lifeson before entering its atmospheric chorus. This is a great track on headphones, especially when Peart's drums bounce from one ear to the other during the pre-chorus. Finally, \\"Vital Signs\\" is one of their cool reggae songs that the band did so well in the early '80s. Also worth noting is that Lee's keyboards get more pronounced as the song concludes, another sign of things to come. Simply put, one of the best albums ever released in popular music. Highly recommended.ir future '80s albums. \\"Witch Hunt\\" is the darkest track here and starts out with a heavy riff from Lifeson before entering its atmospheric chorus.

B0009KA7BS|4.0|It's possible I've missed the point and, no, I haven't seen the comics but this movie has to be one of the most (only?) enjoyable in the \\"demon\\" genre. For the first half-hour I wondered whether I'd made a serious mistake. After that, I learnt to enjoy the ride and the laughs. <br />I'm now entirely convinced the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, entertaining and stimulating - in all of which it has succeeded.  It definitely presses a few buttons and perhaps its detractors' funny bones were bumped a little too hard?
B000002LR6|4.0|This album is only for those initiated to the awesomeness of industrial rock.  If you haven't heard of Nine Inch Nails yet, perhaps Ministry is not for you. <br /> <br />If you have heard of Nine Inch Nails or other industrial bands, such as Front 424 or Skinny Puppy, then what are you waiting for?  \\"Psalm 69\\" is one of the hardest-hitting industrial albums with a strong sense of musicality, but unfortunately a penchant for the melodramatic (like some of Ministry's previous works).  Here's a track-by-track play through. <br /> <br />N.W.O. - 10/10 <br />This amazing opening has the strongest beat on the album.  The end features samples of George Bush Sr. calling for \\"a new world order.\\"  Essential industrial track. <br /> <br />Just One Fix - 5/10 <br />Things get a little out of control with this song, which is too angry to be enjoyable.  Strong beat though. <br /> <br /> TV II - 4/10 <br />Perhaps too heavy for me. <br /> <br />Hero - 5/10 <br />Strong sampling, but otherwise, nothing memorable.  The guitars are too frenetic. <br /> <br />Jesus Built My Hotrod - 8/10 <br />The beginning is a silly line reading, but the main song is bliss.  One of the most popular songs from this album and Ministry's career. <br /> <br />Scare Crow - 9/10 <br />Ahhhh, that's much more like it.  Like the opening track, \\"Scare Crow\\" has a strong underlining melody to accompany the crazy singing and instrumentals.  Very solid song. <br /> <br />Psalm 69 - 5/10 <br />If it weren't for the embarrassing line readings, this song would be alright. <br /> <br />Corrosion - 7/10 <br />Again, this might be too heavy for me.  The underlining beat is great, but it never goes anywhere. <br /> <br />Grace - 5/10 <br />Messy and depressing.  Skip it. <br />
B00005JNSK|5.0|Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are one of my two favorite Hollywood people in the entire world, together they create masterpieces! When I first saw Sleepy Hollow, I LOVED that movie with Johnny's cool acting, and Tim's macabre settings. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is truly one on Burton's and Depp's BEST FILMS. I like this movie SO MUCH MORE than the older one because it has so much more STORY! This is my favorite movie of the year so far! I reccomend it for everyone!
0156027321|1.0|Pretentious parady of what a spiritual treatise should be.  Anyone who walks away from this 'work' by renouncing atheism probably was looking for an easy excuse and a fanciful way out.  To make a bad premise (and analogy) worse the story goes on in detail about some pretty boring stuff (especially lots of metaphor relating christianity and fishing).  If you are a fan of bland pretentious post-modern crap then this is the book for you.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I'm a recent fan of Dream Theater (last few years) and actually preferred the heavier stuff they did on Train of Thought contrary to some of the hard core fans.  I was  perplexed by some of the changes in this last CD, but was encouraged by my brother to give it a few listens before coming to any conclusions.  Having done that, overall I'd say it's a good CD, and overall the vocals are more impressive than I remember on other DT stuff.  Track-by-track here's my opinion: <br /> <br />1.  Decent stuff, but nothing spectacular <br />2.  Interesting and not bad (I sort of cringe at the thought of the bic lighters coming out at the concert, though :-) ) <br />3.  Didn't care for it at first and find the lyrics a bit cheesy, but like the chorus melody a lot. <br />4.  Hmmmm...hard to decide on this one.  Not a bad song...just sounds weird to hear it done by DT. <br />5,6,7 - Very good stuff on these tracks.  Panic Attack is really moving and Sacrificed Sons is well done and timely. <br />8.  Wow!  This track alone is worth the purchase.  It is nothing short of spectacular.  Reminds me of old Yes and Emerson, Lake, and Palmer songs at times during the song.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|This is a very fun movie to look at, but they really needed to spend more time on the story than the visuals. Good, but slow story.
B00005JNSK|4.0|When my kids begged me to take them to this one, I had very low expectations.  With Johnny Depp in the lead and the film being directed by Tim Burton, I assumed it would just be a dark and bizarre interpretation of the original, which was already somewhat dark and bizarre to begin with, in my opinion based on a few vague memories.  After reading several reviews, I decided to go ahead and take my three children, aged 9, 6 and 4.  Much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed this movie, as did my kids.  The scenery is a treat, the children were well cast, and although I am not a huge Depp fan, I have to say that I enjoyed him as Willy Wonka.  I think they should have left the  original Oompa Loompa songs in there, but other than that, it is a heartwarming story (in a Tim Burton kind of way...sweet but not syrupy) and it lends itself well to discussions between parents and children about the virtues of manners and kindness, and the importance of family.
0786183101|3.0|I love this book.  It has such a potential for great accents in the reading, but I'm baffled by this performance.

0380789019|5.0|\\"Dear Diary, on Friday I had a job, a fianc&eacute;e, a home, and a life that made sense. (Well, as much as any life makes sense.) Then I found an injured girl bleeding on the pavement, and I tried to be a Good Samaritan . Now, I've got no fianc&eacute;e, no home, no job, and I'm walking around a couple of hundred feet under the streets of London with the projected life expectancy of a suicidal fruitfly. There are hundreds of people in this Other London. Thousands maybe, People who come from here or people who have fallen through the cracks. I'm wandering around with a girl called Door, her bodyguard, and her psychotic grand vizier.\\"<br /><br />So begins a fantastic adventure of four people who find themselves thrown together in the most bizarre of circumstances. Richard Mayhew, the reluctant hero, must summon up whatever strength he possesses to become a suitable companion for Door, daughter of Portico of the House of Arch, after her entire family has been ruthlessly slaughtered as a backlash for Portico's attempt to unite the baronies and fiefdoms of Lower London. Unable to understand the reason for the brutality Door embarks on a quest to discover the murderer and his true goal. After an attempt on her life, Door hires a bodyguard named Hunter, the most famous and skilled bodyguard of all Lower London, and also employs the Marquis de Carabas, a man whom Richard suspects of being in on the plot. Together, the four set out to find the Angel Islington, a man who may be able to guide Door in finding out who is at fault for the murder of her family.<br /><br />The story is one that sweeps you up from the first page. The tragic killing of Door's family by two assassins, Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, and the subsequent chase of Door through the streets of Upper London, is a clever introduction that nicely balances the ordinary humdrum of Richard Mayhew's typical existence. It sets the pulse for the remainder of the book to one of fast paced action, drama, suspense, and dark humour. I had a hard time putting the book down after the first 50 pages, and I was sorry to see it end. The altered world of Lower London made me think a bit of classic fantasy stories of traveling through altered dimensions (such as Alice in Wonderland or The Wizard of Oz), and the crafting of the dialogue and the story made me think a bit of Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast at times, but the story was so originally Gaiman it was easy to overlook some of these literary nods. This is one of those books that once you read it, you may want to read it again as soon as possible, and I think you would not be disappointed in the second read one bit.<br /><br />\\"You must be more careful with your toys, Mister Vandemar\\".humour.

B000002KLP|5.0|With his first two albums, For You and his 1979 self-titled album, Prince, Prince kept expanding his funk and R&B approaches. But it wasn't until he released his 1980 breakthrough, Dirty Mind, that he not only sharpen his sound, but he made his image as notorious as ever. The whole album was recorded at his home studio, with Prince playing almost all of the instruments. The album introduced the world to a man; whose hormones reached an entire new level. The first track, which is the title track, is a new-wave and funk workout that has Prince doing some of the best drumming and playing the best synthesizer lines in his career. The song itself is just as nasty as it wants to be, with Prince saying that he wants to \\"lay it down in his daddy's car\\". \\"When You Were Mine\\" is a rowdy, rock and roll-based track where Prince talks about allowing his girlfriend to sleep around with another guy. The whole production on this track is really underdeveloped with dry metal guitars and unsteady drum work being played throughout the song. \\"Do It All Night\\" is a synthesizer and bass diven, R&B-disco-like number about Prince wanting to make love to his friend all night, at any time. \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\" is one of my favorites on here. It's a light-hearted ballad about betrayal: one of those make-up and break-up songs. Prince jumps back into gear with the funk-rock of \\"Uptown\\". \\"Uptown\\" is really an utopia on homosexuality and identity, where a girl mistakes Prince as being a homosexual and he coldly replies to her with, \\"No, are you?\\". He visualizes Uptown as a society where anyone of any race can have a good time. \\"Head\\" is a tale of a woman giving oral sex and the woman eventually marries Prince. \\"Sister\\" gets the album more intense and shocking, where Prince is talking about incest. He tells a story about him being a 16-year old virgin with his sister, older than he was, introducing him to the world of sex. The song has Prince doing some of the fastest, rocking guitarsolos and rhythms of his whole career. It's probably one of the most scariest and (truest) songs I've ever heard. \\"Partyup\\" is really Prince making a statement about everyone having a good time instead of fighting in some war. It's really like a tossed-up, yet explicit version of his 1982 hit single, 1999. Dirty Mind, as it stands, is the album that not only made Prince the man he is today, but it was also the album that created a whole new revolution. The subject matter which is about politics and sex is even relevant today, as it was back when this piece of naughty funk and rock was released in 1980. The album is just shocking and fresh at the same time, and you just have to love the production. If you don't know, all of the tracks on this album are demos and really that's why the production was raw, rough, and not-so developed like a real studio album would be, but that was what made it as genuine and fresh as possible. Prince plays all of the instruments really excellent here. Overall, this is a landmark record from a 21-year man who put on a speedo and spoke harshly about what was going on in his dirty mind. I think it ranks up there with masterpieces like 1999, Purple Rain, Parade, and Sign O' The Times. Please buy it and listen to it with extreme caution because it will definitely blow your mind. A+
B0009HLDFU|1.0|The DRM is a definite issue. If the Foo Fighters had balls, they'd stand up to this sort of crap, but they're typical mainstream artists now. Their music proves it further.

B0006L16N8|5.0|With their third album, Colplay has officially arrived onto the \\"short list\\" of my all-time favorite bands.  Sure, I really liked Parachutes, and A Rush of Blood to the Head was even better.  But now that I've purchased X&Y, and it's been spinning in my CD player constantly, I can recognize a succession of compelling Coldplay albums, all of which give me tingles up and down my spine.  It is a rare band that produces such an ample selection of songs, spanning across multiple albums, that move me so deeply.  Coldplay is building the precious combination of depth and breadth to their body of music - and that is what makes a truly great band. <br /> <br />As a prior Coldplay fan, I have found X&Y to be faultless progression from the band's last album.  All the Coldplay trimmings are here, enhanced by a refined sense of songwriting born from experience as one of the world's preeminently rising rock bands.  The tracks on X&Y are as stirring, as majestic, and as soothing as anything you'll hear today.  The band seems to effortlessly weave a variety of musical landscapes together, not only across tracks but also within tracks, leaving the listener in awe of the sound as well as the composition itself.  These are qualities you'll find only among the greatest rock artists in the world, signifying that Coldplay possesses the talent to rank with the best of the best.  When this level of talent is paired with enormously increasing worldwide popularity,  you have all the makings of a legend.   <br />  <br />Indeed, if Coldplay continues down the path they're on today, they will be enshrined forever with universal acceptance as one of the world's best bands.  I'd encourage you to buy X&Y and discover what is behind all the hype.  You won't be disappointed.
B000063DS1|5.0|If I were to rate the packaging, I would have to agree with the reviewer who complained about the way it was made, I've had the discs fall out several times myself.<br />But it's a beautifully packaged and recorded document(in its appearance and sound) that I listen to constantly.<br /><br />One problem I have when I look at the roster of talent, is I'm reminded or our own mortality; so many of these people are now dead, and the era that followed can never replace what was here. That could be good, though, they all sound so alive here, enhanced by one of the best bands ever to grace a stage.<br /><br />As an aside, I wonder why people call a death  \\"passing away,\\" or just \\"passing.\\" They didn't \\"pass,\\" they died; there's no shame in saying it. Richard Manuel, Rick Danko, Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, Carl Radle, and Pop Staples are all dead; go ahead, say it. I don't think they'll mind. Nobody flinches at the word \\"suicide\\" when talking about Richard Manuel, but let Rick Danko peacefully drift off in his sleep, and he \\"passes away.\\" These things have always puzzled me.<br /><br />Back to the music; it's all good, so much talent crossed that stage that night, the audience had a real treat. The Band's songs cover such a wide spectrum of topics, and I understand the guys resenting Robertson's appropriation of the writing credits, but these are men who have definitely walked the walk, and because of that, they are certainly able to talk the talk. You can hear the heartbreak in Rick Danko's delivery of \\"It Makes No Difference,\\" and the effects of the hard life in Richard Manuel's voice in \\"The Shape I'm In,\\" and even more so in \\"Acadian Driftwood.\\" His voice here is hoarse and ragged and PERFECT. Levon Helm summed up Manuel's demons quite well in in The Band's \\"Authorized Biography,\\" and in his book, \\"This Wheel's On Fire.\\" He said \\"That's between him and his Higher Power, and I've always tried to keep from having too much of an opinion about it.\\" He is still shaken over it this many years later, you can see it in the video, because here, he just clams up, takes a big drag on his cigarette, and looks off somewhere into the distance. I can see in him a sense of betrayal by one of his closest friends, and the knowledge that it will always hurt.<br /><br />This is relevant to \\"The Last Waltz,\\" because there was a sense of brotherhood with these guys, from the beginning, all the way through, until huge success started to splinter that element.

B0009A40ES|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think the first time I saw this movie, having not then read the book it's based (albeit somewhat loosely) on. I actually found myself grinning and even laughing aloud while watching this movie, which made me feel sort of guilty...was I supposed to laugh when people were getting butchered gruesomely right and left? Was it really a vicious slasher flick? An 80s nostalgia flick? Or was it a social satire?<br /><br />Actually, it is a bit of all three, though primarily it is a very well-done bit of social satire, commenting on the excesses of the late 1980s by examining one man, Patrick Bateman, played with total yuppie abandon by the remarkable Christian Bale. Bateman is a Wall Street high-flyer, completely lacking in importance but rich enough to give the appearance of it. He is a consummate performer, an empty shell of a man clad in expensive Valentino suits and cared for with the finest products pour l'homme. He blithely admits that he lacks any sort of human emotion except greed and ambition, and this becomes fairly obvious almost immediately; his face is usually fixed in an empty perma-grin, and his voice is rather high-pitched, with that hollow sort of forced cheerfulness that self-help gurus and promoters on late-night infomercials have.<br /><br />This is entirely suitable for Bateman; he is the consummate consumer, far more interested in spending time with his daily personal care routine than in developing any real human relationships. He describes this skin-care and exercise regimen in a lengthy monologue, in fact, near the opening of the film. It is one of the film's most entertaining moments: its unabashed, preening vanity is hysterical, and the sequence is not hurt any by frequent displays of Bale's extremely well-cut physique. Bale uses his physicality as part of his roles, and always has: here he has the well-defined, bulked-up body of a Greek god and clearly spends most of his free time exercising to the point of obsession. This enhances the image of Bateman as a total narcissist, and plays along very well with the 80s obsession with exercise and weight.<br /><br />When he is not discussing himself, Bateman talks mainly about music and pop culture. He delivers paeans to the corporate gods of the music industry: Phil Collins, Whitney Houston, Huey Lewis and the News, MOR - anyone whose work justifies the solipsistic lifestyle he leads - but what he says is often so self-contradictory we wonder if he's actually thought about any of it, or learned it wholesale from the album covers and magazines. His monologuing is usually amusing, but we learn fairly quickly that it is not a good sign; people have a tendency to die when Bateman starts talking about music. In fact, people have a tendency to die when they're around Bateman in general, and this only increases in frequency as the movie progresses.<br /><br />There are many murders in this film, but the viewer is gratefully spared seeing any of them in any sort of detail. The book goes into grisly, delighted in an almost Julia Child-ish way, detail about the killings; here director Mary Harron has the good sense to keep much of the gore off-screen. It was not, in fact, for violence and gore that the film originally got an NC-17 rating, but for a rather risqu&eacute; three-way sex scene. Five or six seconds cut from the theatrical release (but restored on this \\"uncut\\" DVD along with eight other scenes, of varying quality and importance) got it an R-rating instead, but honestly, unless you really pay attention you'll never notice the added footage, and it's no more graphic than what was left in.<br /><br />The film definitely deserves its R-rating, but the violence and the sex are done in such a way that they are not mean or vicious towards the victims, only towards Bateman, who is never made to look anything but a total idiot. These scenes are really more humourous than revolting, though that sounds callous to those who haven't seen the film. Batemanis such a priss, such a total narcissist, that it is impossible to admire or sympathize with him. We cannot believe that the murders are going on anywhere except inside his head; we suspect he's too air-headed to really be capable of killing. Harron does not explicitly say this is the case, but it is more than implied: trails of blood vanish miraculously, chainsaws are aimed impossibly well, people who are supposed to have been murdered turn up mysteriously at restaurants, apartments full of corpses become miraculously empty. Bateman has a way of occupying empty space that makes him completely unmemorable even to his own lawyer, and the end of the film is the strongest argument for everything having gone on in his own twisted mind.<br /><br />Christian Bale is a complete marvel in this role. I have been a fan since his heart-wrenching performance ages ago in \\"Empire of the Sun,\\" though here he has clearly grown up and could not be more different. It speaks well for his versatility that he could go from the youthfully innocent Demetrius in \\"A Midsummer Night's Dream\\" the year before, to the utterly indifferent Patrick Bateman here, to the stoic and thoroughly decent Mandras in \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin\\" the year after. This may be because Bale seems to lack any shred of self-preservation, completely giving himself over to his characters.<br /><br />Here, he completely inhabits Bateman whilst simultaneously making him a 24-hour performer himself. There is nothing to Patrick Bateman: he is all posture and gesture, \\"sound and fury signifying nothing,\\" and Bale nails this in a dead-on performance that is far more nuanced than is often acknowledged. This is a role that could easily make an actor look ridiculous, even repulsive, yet Bale manages by throwing caution to wind to make him, if not believable, acceptable in his own peculiar fashion. It takes a very distinct courage to run down a corridor, blood-spattered and wearing nothing but tennis-shoes, bearing a mirror-polished gleaming chainsaw and screaming at the top of one's lungs. Bale has it, and manages to be so ludicrous and off-the-wall in this scene that I had time to notice that he wasn't wearing socks in his shoes, and could be more offended by this than the thought of the chainsaw. This sort of response is essential to the proper understanding and enjoyment of this movie.<br /><br />The film is strongest as a commentary and exposition of the 1980s yuppie quest for world domination, though some may complain Harron is a one-note director and hammers her point home a little too well. The 80s were a decade of total narcissism, when it was \\"hip to be square,\\" greed was good, and one's social importance was determined largely by what restaurants one could get into on a Friday night. (This is, in fact, the inspiration for one of Bateman's murderous rages.) By carrying these themes into the exaggerated, hyper-macho world of corporate takeovers, Harron is able to more fully explore them. Here, Bateman's murders become the logical if radical extensions of Wall Street's corporate aggressiveness, and \\"mergers and acquisitions\\" are not so far removed from \\"murders and executions,\\" and his utter indifference to anyone but himself is the reasonable end of the dehumanizing of the corporate machine.t it is impossible to admire or sympathize with him.

1573223026|5.0|Nick Hornsby's A Long Way Down is a black comedy charmer.  His character Jess, the angry, foul-mouthed and clueless young punk is one of the freshest and most delightful characters to come down the pike in a long time.  Young actresses in Hollywood and London will be fighting tooth-and-nail for the chance to play her in the film because she's the moral center of the novel and a full-on career-maker for the right talent.  And rest assured, this novel will certainly be made into a film.  Like Hornsby's other books High Fidelity and About a Boy, the dialogue crackles and carries the full energy of the characters.  Combine that with the irresistible charm of Hornsby's theme (the redemptive quality of human relationships, particularly among strange bedfellows) and you've got a confection Hollywood can't resist and audiences are eager to gobble up.<br /><br />Nothing wrong with that, I say.  In these jaded days when sentimentality is sniffed out and throttled before it can peek out of its hole, it's good to know that a modern day Frank Capra is at work, producing smile-quirking stories with real characters, contemporary settings and plausible plots.  And Hornsby never takes the easy way out.  From losers laboring in a record store in a pathetic attempt to give shape to their lives (High Fidelity), to a self-centered lothario trying to avoid being sucked into the swamp of genuine human emotions (About a Boy), he gives us characters that are initially despicable, and lulls us into loving them.  With A Long Way Down, he walks further out onto the ledge.<br /><br />The four characters in this book are attempting to commit suicide.  Their reasons range from the understandable to the idiotic to the vain.  It's hard to get close to them; a couple of them are so irredeemable or so damaged they're off-putting, and the other two just seem self-centered.  The gauntlet Hornsby has thrown down is that he is going to make them sympathetic and lovable and charming, and sure enough, he does.  Hornsby has raised the bar and vaulted over it.  This is courageous writing, an author in search of new levels, and he goes right after them, bringing us along.<br /><br />America needs a writer like Hornsby today (even though he is ever so English).  We need to know there's still something charming and delightful about even the most seemingly distasteful individuals and we need to be reminded that the way to discover the richness of our fellow human beings has almost nothing to do with defining moral goodness on our own terms and trying to force people to conform to it, but has almost everything to do with ferreting out the moral goodness as it resides in the souls of some of the most unlikely people and opening our arms to it.  Hornsby understands this and communicates it better than any writer of our time.  His work in necessary and true - which is why so many readers (and movie goers) have flocked to it.<br /><br />I'm reminded of a writing assignment I had in high school.  Take an unlikely situation and see how you can develop it.  If this was Hornsby's first book, it would never have seen the light of day.  Four people who happen upon each other while attempting to commit suicide and become friends and learn how to cope and move on.  Right.  How can you write this so it's not clich&eacute;d and dripping with maudlin sentimentality? How can you write it so it's clever and funny and true with a few laugh-out-loud moments sprinkled in?  How do you write it so it means something, other than the obvious?  Well, ask Nick Hornsby.  He's the artist, in all the best meanings of the term.  Courageous, sensitive and talented.  He's answered all the questions.  All you have to do is read A Long Way Down to find the answers.he does.  Hornsby has raised the bar and vaulted over it.

B00005JLWN|4.0|Yes, the film is a blatant reworking of aspects of Orwell's '1984' and Huxley's 'Brave New World.' However, this does not make it a bad film; it has no spectacular goals, but it achieves what it sets out to do nicely.<br /><br />The story is set in the not-too-distant future, the late 21st century, sometime after the Third World War. The world's leaders, or at least the enigmatic leader of a nation called Libria, have decided that the best way to rule out such catastrophic violence happening again is to eliminate all human emotion. They do this by heavily medicating the entire population on doses of a drug called Prozium. The name bears more than a passing resemblance to certain very popular drugs of our own day, but this is how \\"Equilibrium\\" works: by suggesting things rather than outright saying them. The underlying ideas of this film are rather deep for this sort of action/sci-fi flick: that freedom of thought is dangerous to regimes, that individualism is the greatest threat to totalitarianism, that thinking or feeling too much is the most dangerous enemy of a government.<br /><br />These ideas are certainly an undercurrent in the film, but \\"Equilibrium\\" is by no means a deep, strictly philosophical movie; it is very content to be a fast-paced action flick, and is quite successful at it too. It reworks material that's been seen before, to be sure, but it does so nicely, in a slick, fast-moving package, marrying action with thought to keep both sorts of audiences happy.<br /><br />To keep the drug-induced peace, as well as hunt down \\"Sense Offenders\\" (those who refuse the drugs and engage in feeling, thinking, and otherwise enjoying themselves), the government of Libria - run by the nearly-omnipotent and highly Orwellian figure known only as \\"Father\\" - employs what are known as Tetragrammaton Clerics, who are highly trained in martial arts and psychology, dress in long black coats, and kill without compunction.<br /><br />The principal Cleric, and the most talented, is John Preston, played with fierce inscrutable perfection by Christian Bale, who seems to specialize in off-beat characters who distance themselves from humanity. He does it nowhere better than here: he keeps his features dispassionately cool even as he suggests a growing madness behind his dark eyes. Director Kurt Wimmer says he didn't think of offering the role to anyone but Christian Bale: watching him perform, there is no question as to why. Here Bale's dark good looks and intense manner are menacingly appropriate to his character; in his first scene, we see him surf into a completely darkened room on the door that he just kicked from its hinges, firing off several dozen shots with what turns out to be lethal accuracy. This is an exhilarating sequence, the first of many.<br /><br />Sean Bean plays his first partner, Cleric Errol Partridge; he is only in the film for 15 minutes or so, but he brings a quiet kind of poetry to Partridge that is most impressive. The two soon have a lethal falling-out when Preston discovers that Partridge has become a Sense Offender. Soon, of course, the inevitable happens: Preston misses his morning interval of Prozium and begins to feel. At first he is understandably apprehensive about this; he is, after all, the head Cleric, under a mandate to murder - ahem, \\"summarily combust\\" or otherwise eliminate - anyone who feels. He is very good at this job; indeed, he let his own wife be arrested and killed for Sense Offending. (This is one of the most perplexing bits of the story: given his extraordinarily cold demeanour, it is understandable that she might be driven to such things, but he is also extremely adept at sensing when other people feel...how is it that he never suspected her, especially as sex is clearly not outlawed in Libria?)<br /><br />He intends to reinstate his dosage as soon as possible but finds reasons not to...soon enough, of course, he finds he cannot help himself, and willingly begins to dispose of his drugs without taking them. His new partner, Brandt, played with slick menace by Taye Diggs, is very like Preston, clever and adept at knowing what people are thinking and when they are feeling. He wears an almost permanent grin, flashing blinding white teeth and eyes that sparkle with an ominous glint that makes one wonder what he knows and what he plans to do with it. He is absolutely a match for Preston. All this leads invariably to complications, but to say more would be to reveal more of the plot than I should.<br /><br />The scenes where Preston revels in his new-found emotions are extremely well-done, particularly one in the old cellar of an abandoned house that contains relics of the past that it is his duty as a Cleric to destroy. He discovers an old LP of Beethoven and plays it; it is most likely the first time Preston has ever heard music in his life, and Bale's face is an absolute marvel as he reacts to the passionate strings and brass of the 9th Symphony, a mixture of elation and despair, joy and heartbrokenness and surprise all at once.<br /><br />The visual design of this picture is really fabulous. It is shot primarily in shades of steel-grey, white, and black, providing an altogether drearily futuristic feel. This is particularly effective when shots of color are introduced, such as a symbolic red ribbon or a rainbow seen through a window; surrounded by such  unrelenting colorlessness, they gain far more intensity. Lines are smooth, sleek, hyper-modern. The \\"new,\\" government-sanctioned buildings are large, monolithic cement structures with an almost obnoxious lack of personality.<br /><br />The style of the film has been compared to just about every martial arts/sci-fi flick made in recent memory, particularly to \\"The Matrix.\\" This is largely due to the fight scenes, which are long, choreographed martial arts sequences similar to those found elsewhere. If you're looking for an \\"original\\" martial-arts picture you won't find it here; the only new thing introduced really is the \\"gun-kata,\\" a form of martial arts using guns. However, I find \\"Equilibrium\\" immensely more satisfying than \\"The Matrix\\", largely due to the strong performances of the cast and the far smarter dialogue. The philosophy is actually meaningful in \\"Equilibrium,\\" although it is pop-philosophy to be sure. Still, it is intriguing, and richly ironic in places, particularly the idea that the only murderers left are those who are government-sanctioned; the only people who kill now are those determined to keep anyone else from killing. In perhaps the greatest irony in the film, the Clerics are asked to \\"put their faith\\" in Father, though faith would be a feeling and should therefore be outlawed; they do the Will of the Father based on their faith in him, which sounds very much more like a religion than a government.<br /><br />\\"Equilibrium\\" is not a particularly deep-thinking film, but it is certainly more thoughtful than much of what passes as philosophy nowadays. More than that, though, it is purely entertaining, with fast-paced gunfights, slick swordfights, a funky soundtrack, and an utterly exhilarating climax that will take your breath away. Bale is an absolute pleasure to watch. It is disappointing this film never got a wider release in the States - I watched in dismay as release date after release date got pushed away, perhaps out of fear that the American public at large wasn't ready for such a film - but if you can get it on DVD, by all means see it.

B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's second album, 1984's \\"Ride the Lightning,\\" was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.<br /><br />With 1983's \\"Kill `Em All,\\" Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel \\"Ride the Lightning\\" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was \\"Master of Puppets.\\"<br /><br />\\"Ride the Lightning\\" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than \\"Kill `Em All.\\" James' voice is somewhat lower than it was, and his lyrics are improved. As the above Amazon editorial review mentions, James discusses several different ways to die: Armageddon, capitol punishment, suicide, being trapped under ice, etc.<br /><br />\\"Fight Fire with Fire\\" has the aforementioned acoustic intro, but it's just a tease-it doesn't last. The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed, with rip-roaring, almost Slayer-esque guitar work. Lyrically, this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse.<br /><br />\\"Ride the Lightning\\" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. \\"Ride the Lightning\\" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.<br /><br />\\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" is slower paced, but still loud and heavy. The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental, beginning with a bell ringing, then the heavy, repetitive, churning guitars kick in. This song has another good, winding solo near the end.<br /><br />\\"Fade to Black\\" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.<br /><br />\\"Trapped Under Ice\\" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle.<br /><br />\\"Escape\\" has vocals which make it radio ready (it has good vocal hooks). Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming, but the choruses are slower.<br /><br />\\"Creeping Death\\" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming, before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead. And, of course, there's another stellar solo near the end.<br /><br />\\"The Call of KTULU\\" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as \\"Orion\\" (from Metallica's next album, \\"Master of Puppets,\\") and it's a very good way to end the album. It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes, but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster. This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work.<br /><br />So, this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it's still one of the best C.D.'s of the past two decades. All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here: long songs (about 6 minutes per song), rapid fire riffs, ripping solos, an instrumental track, and even some acoustic guitar licks. In conclusion, if you want a complete metal collection, or if you just like heavy metal, you need this album more than you need your next breath.rning guitars kick in.

B00006JDVV|3.0|Where do I begin? This is a movie whose basic premise is so ludicrous one wonders how the project got off the ground. Its dialogue is mostly uninspired and much of the acting is far more serious than it needs to be. And yet, despite all this it is entertaining, in a dumb sort of way, and has a strangely high rewatchability factor.<br /><br />The premise is, of course, that dragons have awakened from their long sleep to attack and destroy much of Earth. And we're talking a loooong sleep here; the fiery wyrms have supposedly lain dormant but alive in the earth's bowels since the time of the dinosaurs. Why it is exactly that the construction of one particular metro station in London is enough to awaken them all, when they apparently slept through the construction of the entire Underground, is not explained. Nor is how when nuclear arsenals and weapons of mass destruction failed to destroy the beasts the far more primitive weapons of twenty years on are successful. Other concerns, such as what dragons eat and how they breed, are given a cursory treatment, but even this seems to be made up as the film goes along, and they are not at all logically satisfactory.<br /><br />The pleasure of a movie like this does not rest in its logic, however, but on how much we like and are engaged by its leads. Christian Bale and Matthew McConaughey both do their jobs here, though it is clear Bale is the far superior actor; even the utter stupidity of the plot cannot shake his conviction, and the film rests largely on his shoulders. His Quinn Abercromby is a man of resolution and determination, a survivor who has much faith in the idea that \\"he who fights and runs away can run away another day.\\" He has successfully kept a little enclave of people alive for twenty years or so, holed up in a crumbling castle in Northumberland, England, where he has meticulously documented everything he knows and discovers about dragons.<br /><br />There are moments of inspiration despite all the stupidity; one in particular, involving the two main leaders of the little enclave - given the unfortunate names Quinn and Creedy - performing a primitive version of \\"Star Wars\\" for the children, is actually quite touching. Bale conveys an air of suitable weighty responsibility, and makes keeping his people alive look like the tough job it must be.<br /><br />All of this changes one fateful day when a troop of Americans - they're the only thing worse than dragons, we're informed by one British sentry - drives pell-mell into the castle grounds, demanding sanctuary and a place to use as a base while they hunt dragons. McConaughey's Denton Van Zan - one does wonder who came up with the names for these people - is a hyper-macho American military man, whose braggadocio ways are simultaneously repulsive and intriguing to Quinn, who allows Van Zan and his people a place in his castle. McConaughey swaggers about and chews up the scenery, ridiculously overacting. It works, though, particularly as he must deliver some of the innately dumbest lines in the movie, about \\"bringing down the beast\\" and how to \\"kill the male, kill the species.\\" His shaved head, scraggy beard, and bizarre body art definitely make him one of the more memorable-looking movie characters to date. He is a madman to Bale's voice of totally controlled sanity, and the two play off each other nicely.<br /><br />Much action and little thought ensues; the dragons are eventually taken down by means that are not necessary to explain, as they are so very stupid. Let us just say they involve the extremely problematic notion that killing the one male of the species (yes, there really is only one, though according to the dragon-slayers all the females they've ever slain have been pregnant...this also is problematic if one believes their explanation of dragon fertilization, but never mind) will result in the destruction of the whole lot of them. Despite all logic, this plan succeeds, and eventually peace and a modicum of harmonyare restored to the planet, partly, one suspects, due to the absence of Van Zan. One does wonder why the last words in the picture are \\"thank God for evolution,\\" though...wouldn't evolution be the very thing that made the dragons so close to indestructible?suspects, due to the absence of Van Zan. One does wonder why the last words in the picture are \\"thank God for evolution,\\" though...wouldn't evolution be the very thing that made the dragons so close to indestructible?

B00005JNSK|3.0|When I first heard that a re-make of \\"Chocolate Factory\\" was being planned with Tim Burton at the helm, I couldn't have been more pleased. I have long been a fan of the book but loathed the 70's treacle of Gene Wilder's film; the forced, insane cheeriness was highly unsuitable for the strange and somewhat sadistic rages against the evils of sloth and spoiledness that Dahl's book comprised. And Johnny Depp's collaborations with Burton have usually produced spectacular results, so I was very pleased to know that he would be starring.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the combination is less than inspired this time. The film's performances range from sketchy to perfection. Bizarrely, Johnny Depp's lands squarely in the middle of the spectrum, hardly something I expected from an actor I consider to be one of the finest...ever. His Wonka is just...weird. And not in a pleasant way. With his pasty skin, strange make-up, alarmingly perfect teeth, and honeyed, meretricious voice and mannerisms, he conjures up disturbing images of Michael Jackson, or perhaps the bizarre love-child of Jackson and Carol Channing. He is certainly a unique character - I've never seen Depp quite like this before - and it's a brave and risky performance, but it is just too freakish to quite be acceptable onscreen. Wonka would certainly be a bizarre social recluse, perhaps even a compulsive performer, but he is also here so weird and even sadistic that I found myself very uncomfortable at the prospect of him sharing space with children, even those as unpleasant as the four obnoxious miscreants. I was also slightly perplexed, too, by the fact that Wonka is seemingly more comfortable with the childrens' guardians than the children themselves; he cannot even bring himself to say the word \\"parents\\" and his own familial relationships are strained, to say the least. Given the fact that Burton has conceived of Wonka's Chocolate Factory as a child-like wonderland of a playground, and that Depp plays him as a boy who refuses to grow up, it doesn't make much sense for him to be so VERY uncomfortable around the children.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore, however, is absolutely amazing. He is not given much to say, and in fact is not center-screen as much as I had expected, but he steals every scene he is in. Not since Christian Bale in \\"Empire of the Sun\\" has there been such an adorable and absolutely prodigiously gifted young actor. I cannot be over-effusive in my praise. Highmore's performance is easily the most phenomenal and engaging in the film; with his sparkling brown eyes, teacup ears, freckled nose, and boyish grin, he is completely loveable and inspires absolute trust. His Charlie Bucket is ever-so decent, responsible, dependable, and sweet-natured, and yet Highmore conveys all this without ever making him maudlin, obnoxious, or treacly. There is no trace of bathos in his performance, a surprisingly difficult feat which he accomplishes perfectly. We can see why Wonka is willing to entrust his candy empire to Charlie, and why his grandfather would give up what would seem to be his last dollar to buy him another shot at the Golden Ticket.<br /><br />David Kelly as Grandpa Joe is endearing and another of the films fine performances, though sadly he and Charlie are not given much time to interact. Have we not all longed at one time or another for a grandparent like Grandpa Joe? He is old but still retains a rather sharp-edged humour, and his eyes twinkle frequently with delight and kindness. He is a pleasure to watch onscreen, even when he and the other guests are being visually (and otherwise) assaulted by the Factory.<br /><br />The Oompa-Loompas are actually one of the better things about this film, all played by the slightly menacing Indian actor Deep Roy. The musical numbers celebrating (there is no other word for it) the naughty childrens' fates are still here, but their styles range from Bollywood to disco to 80s pop, and are show-stoppers in their own right. They are, happily, not orange, and not particularly pleasant either; one feels slightly uneasy whenever they are around, and it is usually a justified discomfort.<br /><br />The visual design is the best aspect of the film (apart from Highmore). Tim Burton has gone wildly overboard with his fantasy world, but it is here not only justified but absolutely necessary. I particularly loved the Buckets' house: it leans so drunkenly that it could not possibly exist in reality, and bits and pieces of it are artistically missing. Charlie's grandparents all sleep (and apparently live) in the same bedraggled brass bed in the centre of the tiny main room, and Charlie himself sleeps in a nearly-roofless garrett with a view of the great Factory.<br /><br />The candyland of the Chocolate Factory is a child's idea of paradise, with its chocolate river and edible grass and foliage, but it also is appropriately Burtonesque in its suggestion of danger as well as delight: you can eat everything in there, but there is a possibility it could devour you too. Even the peppermint willow trees bend ominously over the riverbanks, stretching their red-and-white-striped branches out like skinny fingers in that peculiar way that only Burton's trees do. The wild ride down the Chocolate River in the flaming-pink candy-Dragon boat (a delight to look at) is inspired and a pleasure to watch, though the suggestion of slave labor (the Oompa-Loompas row the boat to the pounding of a drum strangely reminiscent of Ben-Hur's) adds another appropriately dark touch to Wonka's paradise. The trained squirrels who mete out the spoiled Veruca Salt's punishment were particularly impressive; apparently Burton had some twenty squirrels actually trained for the part and then replicated them with CG, which means these little furry things are unnervingly realistic. As anyone who shares space with squirrels knows, they can be quite menacing creatures, and Burton captures this very well; this sequence is possibly the most disturbing and uncomfortable in its suggestion of violence in the film, but it works. The effects are generally well-used in the film, though always maintaining a certain air of artificiality that becomes the tone of the piece. The opening sequence, an aerial trip through the Chocolate Factory, is thrilling and inspired.<br /><br />Ultimately, there are some very enjoyable moments in this film, particularly the scenes with Charlie and the rest of the Bucket family, but they do not coalesce into a proper whole. One is frequently agape and frequently left staring in slack-jawed wonderment at the Factory and its wonders, as are Wonka's guests, but sometimes it feels like we are not awe-struck but merely dumb-struck. The tone of the film is manic, almost distracted in places (much like Depp's performance) and never lets the audience really become engaged with it.

B0009IW88A|4.0|Wow, After i saw this movie i just had to get the soundtracks, like someone else said aswell, the music really lifts Batman Begins to a higher level, During the action scene's you clearly hear the move of Zimmer, the heavy and fast paced melody, and at the end of those songs, during emotional or dramatic scene's you will hear the beautiful, touching tunes of James Newton Howard which are perfectly played into each other which fits so well! I really started to love James newton howard's work after i saw movie's such as Signs & The village, The music for the village is really a art on its own, and James gets real close by doing it again in Batman begins... As allready has been announced, Batman Begins will continue and i really hope that both of them will sign up again for the 2e project because these two men are creating rememberable score's! Go get the soundtrack!
B0009UC7H0|3.0|\\"Sahara\\" is one of that delightful breed of movies that I like to call a \\"smart dumb movie,\\" because it is stupid, it knows it is stupid, and it revels in its own stupidity. It does not hurt to have significant eye-candy in a Smart Dumb Movie; here Matthew McConaughey fills the requirement nicely, displaying beach-blond locks and a bronzed, buff body that are welcome distractions from the shreds of plot.<br /><br />The plot, from what I bothered to piece together, revolves around ironclad steamboats from the Civil War, one in particular that our hero - bearing the hilariously macho appellation Dirk Pitt - believes crossed the Atlantic bearing a substantial fortune before vanishing into the unknown. This unknown is, of course, the Sahara Desert, but by the time the ironclad makes an appearance again near the end of the movie we are so distracted by all the other plot elements thrown at us that we have forgotten it is supposed to be there, and it is made rather amusing use of.<br /><br />Dirk Pitt is accompanied on his grand adventures - he is a treasure seeker, so his adventures are all grand - by his trusty sidekick Al, who does remarkable things with and to boats. They are joined soon by the lovely Dr. Eva Rojas, who thinks strange and nasty things are happening in the desert. She is right, more than she knows, but this does not really matter all that much as plot is a very insubstantial element in movies like this. Things explode, people run and dangle from very high places, and the usual bits of comic relief are involved, although there is a particular moment involving a jeep, an old airplane, and surfing that is quite outstanding.<br /><br />It is not necessary to divulge more of the plot than this, because there is a lot more of it and none of it really matters at all. Matthew McConaughey brings a macho flair to Dirk Pitt that works in a larger-than-life way, and Penelope Cruz is her usual lovely but unremarkable and somewhat helpless self. It all works, though, and though the result is supremely stupid it is two hours of unabashed amusement that is excellent for summer fare.is supremely stupid it is two hours of unabashed amusement that is excellent for summer fare.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Man this movie was good! I love inspirational true stories that have a huge impact on other lives. Seabiscuit is definately what the doctor ordered.   My Uncle owns a few race horses (my Grandmother as well before she died) and they often took me along for the ride at the Santa Anita race track where I saw George Wolf's and Seabiscuit's statues. I started going when I was 10 and remember them telling the story about Seabiscuit.   This movie (to me) has got to be one of the best I've seen. It has everything you want if you need that uplifting inspirational topic. Go ahead and get it because this is worth the buy 10 times over.

Tupac was a poetic rapper, who had alot of things to say. though he is dead, he still expresses them. This cd  has the classic song \\"Thugz Mansion\\" feat. nas. There is a another version on here witch is just as good. So if you want to get a pac cd that was released after his death, this one is the one to get. RIP 2pac Amaru Shakur.

The drummer is pretty stellar, and so is the singer.  Overall, it comes quite recommended.

Im not saying that you dont have good taste of music at an early age i just think music today was very diffrent from when Pink Floyd was around this is a great piece of work and I find it hard to see someone who thinks that this CD was crap. If you loved this Cd buy The Wall its just as good. A true work of art.

Coldplay is FAR superior. This is not really emotional music.
B000059HB7|5.0|\\"Rio Bravo\\" is a very entertaining and quality film suitable for the entire family.<br /><br />The film boasts an all-star cast that boasts a wealth of talent.  John Wayne is the tough sherrif John T. Chance, who has to hold a prisoner charged with murder in his small jail awaiting the arrival of the territory judge.  Wayne gives one of his best performances.  Dean Martin plays Wayne's troubled  drunk deputy.  Martin surprises everyone by showing just how wonderful an actor he is.  In a difficult role, Martin excels.  Angie Dickenson is Wayne's love interest.  Dickenson's role is also an emotionally challenging bit of acting, but she pulls it off easily with room to spare.  Walter Brennan is Wayne's crippled deputy and he also excels and provides comic relief.  Brennan is so convincing as the crippled leg deputy that many fans of Brennan believed that he was actually crippled in real life.  Brennan walked as good as anyone and it is a tribute to him that he convinced all of us that he had a bum leg!  Rounding out the cast is the very young heartthrob Ricky Nelson, who plays \\"Colorado\\", a trailhand with a good gun.  Nelson is in over his head here as an actor, but was probably included in the film for his ability to bring in the female audience.  Ward Bond and Claude Akins round out the excellent cast.<br /><br />Director Howard Hawks uses the cast to his advantage.  His directorship keeps the film moving along at a steady pace.  Interestingly, the first several minutes of the film has no dialogue at all!  John Wayne speaks the first line about 4 minutes into the film after much action has already taken place.<br /><br />This film represents Hawks' and Wayne's response to the movie \\"High Noon\\", which both men despised.  Wayne and Hawks were disturbed by \\"High Noon\\" as no townspeople came to the help of the sherrif who had to face down a gang of thugs by himself.  Both men believed that the good men and women of the community would rally to the side of good and face down evil.  In 'Rio Bravo\\", Wayne's sherrif does not go it alone, but gets help from several sources.<br /><br />Dimitri Tiomkin's score is a good one, originally made for the classic western, \\"Red River\\".  Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson combine their vocal talents in the duet \\"My Rifle, My Pony, And Me\\".  Believe it or not, Walter Brennan adds his vocal talents in a song that follows!<br /><br />\\"Rio Bravo\\" is a very satisfying and entertaining film fit for the entire family.  There is no profanity, love scenes are done discretely, and the expected violence is not graphic or gratuitous.  As a kid, this was one of my favorite \\"John Wayne\\" movies.  As an adult, it continues to be a favorite, and I believe it will be a favorite of yours too.  Out of 10 stars, I'd give it a solid 9.<br /><br />Jim Konedog Koenigd and face down evil.

B00006JU7T|5.0|Based on the true life exploits of NYC policeman Frank Serpico, Sidney Lumet's SERPICO bristles with intensity and hard-nosed drama.  Al Pacino in one of his many Oscar nominated performances, inhabits the role of Serpico with vibrant purpose and brings home the desperate plight of an honest cop amid such corruption.  Transfer after transfer, Serpico finds himself embroiled in the many money-making schemes of the dishonest cops and has the courage to stand for true justice, even risking his relationships and life.  Many such crime stories that surfaced later all felt the impact of this dynamic movie and it still stands today as an important piece of cinematic excellence.
B0009MDPYW|2.0|Lightweight supernatural thriller that tries to be hip but just ends up falling flat on its face most of the time. Keanu just does not cut it as the main character and he leaves his co-star Rachel Weisz to not only pick up most of his slack in the acting department but to have her hold the movie together by herself because she is the only actor in the film who manages stand over the bad script and flip flop direction to give a strong and compelling performance. Unfortunately, while she is doing her best, the film lets her and the audience down with it's last act which is so painfully contrive that you will be in the doctors office the next day because you would have rolled your eyes once too many times at the stupid plot revelations and really bad dialog that accompanies the film's lackluster climax.  It's a good film too see if you need to fill your night but with out Weisz's game performance to push this film forward, the film would have been as interesting as an late night infomercial.

B0009A1AS2|2.0|Thank God for MP3 downloads. I don't think this will be 1 CD I would buy. What's happening with DT is they're pumping too many albums out. So many in that they really don't spend enough time to thoroughly write the songs.  <br /> <br />Mike Portnoy could of done a lot better in his precussion playing. Just seems like the whole album was based on typical 'Jam Sessions' rather than writing the songs out on paper before playing a note.... The result is a song that simply sounds too generic with little time changes (how can you orchestrate a time change when you jam?) <br /> <br />James LaBrie should really stop singing like Radiohead. Since when Radiohead was considered progressive rock? A very depressing sound. For the other songs that aren't so Radiohead like, his vocal singing sounds much more like mainstream radio music.  <br /> <br />The only decent melody I could get out of the album is Jordan Rudess's keyboard playing (half way into the Octavarium song).  <br /> <br />
B00005JNJT|2.0|This wasn't a bad movie per se, but I was expecting so much more. I would have to rank this as the 3rd best in the series, behind the first two. While it was nice to see the origins of Batman, I think they gave away too much. Because Batman is such a mysterious character, I think it would've been best to have his origins described in vague manner, instead of spelling it out for every first grader to understand. Much of Batman's mystery was lost and because of this, the movie lost much of its appeal. Another thing that bothered me was when they showed him coming back from Princeton, they tried to make him look young a few years younger, however, Katie Holmes' character didn't age at all (I guess she uses Oil of Olay). Contrary to other reviews, I don't think her perfomance tarnished the movie, but I think her not aging whatsoever like Christian Bale really irritated me (you can suspend your belief only so much).. <br /> <br />Then we have the person who played the psych doctor at the hospital (the one w/ the glasses and scarecrow mask) looks like a prototypical  high school drama geek who always got his @ss kicked everyday after school. And how about that ending?? How can there be so much carnage and no talk of casualties. I was thinking to myself when the train flew off the tracks and took out everything in its path that at least 10,000 people died in this one scene. I will say I liked Christian Bale much better than Clooney or Kilmer, but this role was perfected by Michael Keaton. The supporting actors were excellent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, but the one who played the heroic cop was SOO boring. As you can see, casting was a mixed bag. <br /> <br />In conclusion, I expect many people to tar and feather this review or to not pay any heed to it whatsoever, but I have a feeling many of you will agree with me, but will fall in line with everyone else and give it 5 stars.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Tim Burton's movie world is almost always concerned with the dreamer and the dream: think Frank Bloom (Ewan McGregor and Albert Finney) in \\"Big Fish\\" and Ed Woods (Johnny Depp) in the film of the same name. But his films are also often about the search for a father, either real or emotionally as in \\"Big Fish\\" again and \\"Edward Scissorhands.\\"<br />Burton's version of the Willie Wonka story is about both, the dreamer: Willie and Charlie (Freddie Highmore) and the search for a father:  the very strange acting and looking Willie Wonka of Johnny Depp for his estranged father, Dr. Wonka (Christopher Lee). Roald Dahl's source material as well as this film share the common theme of men aching from the loss of and searching for the most important relationship in a man's life: the bond between a man and his father.<br />Burton's world is also one of perfection and beauty: think the Technicolor gone bananas neighborhood of \\"Edward Scissorhands.\\" Philippe Roussellot's production here is likewise blindingly gorgeous and eye-poppingly dense with color and artful design.<br />This version of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" is much closer to that of Dahl's in that it is wittier and likewise naughtily misanthropic than the previous Gene Wilder version. Burton's \\"CATCF\\" is sly and malicious, particularly in his treatment of the children that Willie tours around his factory. As in Dahl's story, these children represent a good part of the 7 Deadly sins: Gluttony in the guise of the chubby Augustus Gloop, Greed and Anger in the perfectly page-boyed and unctuous Violet Beauregarde, Pride in the obnoxious Mike Teavee (to whom Willie is perpetually saying \\"Stop Mumbling, I can't understand you!\\" when his speech is perfectly understandable) and Anger and Envy in the spoiled brattiness of Veruca Salt. Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and his family stand alone as the embodiment of goodness, caring and love and they alone benefit from Charlie's visit to the Factory.<br />Burton and Depp have a great time putting these kids and their parents in their \\"place\\" and though it is a bit cruel, it is fun for us nonetheless: we participate in the action despite our better judgment. And this is the genius of Burton's version of this material: it's dark, it's wicked but it's also full of whimsy and wonder: it's just a hell of a lot of fun.me putting these kids and their parents in their \\"place\\" and though it is a bit cruel, it is fun for us nonetheless: we participate in the action despite our better judgment.

B0002XNT0I|3.0|This movie had the potential to tell a compelling story, but for me it missed the mark. It's not a bad movie, but I didn't think it was so great.<br /><br />The movie had good believable acting from Hanks and Denzel Washington, but the part the movie fails in is the TELLING of the story. There's just too many courtroom scenes and not enough character development, and without that, it gets pretty boring and repetitive. You can't give the movie credit for the story it's TRYING to tell, because as far as I'm concerned, the story it DID tell was not told in an entertaining way.<br /><br />The two main characters weren't developed enough. For one, the transformation of Denzel's feelings about gay people was not believable, there just wasn't enough shown on screen to make the viewer believe that he would have any reason to change his feelings. The way it was directed, it looked as if that opera scene is what changed Denzel's feelings about Hanks, and that's ridiculous to have someone's lifelong feelings that has been etched into their persona be changed almost because of a single incident (like I said, the way it was directed implied this). They should've shown a gradual change and made it interesting, maybe throw in a scene where Denzel protects Hanks from ridicule or something, I don't know, just show some sort of growing relationship to make the viewer care.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Lemme get one thing straitened up with everyone first. I guess there are different opiions but slipknot is NOT friggin nu metal!!! They are not totally metal, i mean you can go way heavier with lamb of god and shadows fall, and go even deeper with death metal bands, but the worst thing you can do is catagorize this as nu metal. Nu metal is usually what gets people into this stuff, so a debt is owed, but cmon. I mean, a kid'll start listening to a limp bizkit song, then they'll hear a nu metalish song like spit it out, then they'll buy a slipnot cd, which is when they'll hear a song like (sic). Then it's the heavy riffs from slipknot that get someone to take two hours to watch headbangers ball and get hooked on something really heavy. Ok, moving on... One thing I found that I could comapre this cd to is the metallica's black album, and in my  opinion, this is slipknot's black album, and the songs can be compared, duality_entaer sandman (the mainstream first single... not the heaviest thing on the album)... vermilion_the unforgiven (the slow heavy song that shows emotion)... circle_nothing else matters (the acoustic ballad)... and i could go on... (don't worry i won't)... umm, i just want to straiten this up with the dude who said slipknot was pointless and satanist and listen to solidstate... umm... sinai beach is with victory ad as i lay dying is with metal blade, and u never mentioned norma jean, who is the best solid state band... and about mhow it makes u want to kill urself? if a song like circle is gonna make you want to kill yourself... i dunno... that seems a little exaggerated. I agree with the dude who said mick and jim arent any kirk hammet or kerry king, but the torch has beenn passed to slipknot, and jim and mick can play ffasssttt... sso they have the potenntial... Here are my song reviews or whatever... <br />Prelude 3.0- took a while to actually listen to all the way, i kinda got bored along with danger and virus, i didnt think of it as an actual song, but once you need a break from everything else these songs are refreshing... <br />The Blister Exists- Good fast song to kick someone into attention for the rest of the album... good show of percussions and snare work and coureys heavy to melodic vocals <br />Three Nil- Not the most unique intro... not that unique at all, but the lyrics are pretty catchy...  <br />Duality- This is the song that gets most people to buy this cd, its not the best song on the cd, but its the most mainstream and like i said its the enter sandman of the album... anyone who didnt think this song was heavy enough, blame society, we live in a metalless world and slipknot was smart to make a song that would get airtime <br />Opium For The People- Intro gets annoying but is pretty good instrument wise, probably one of my favorite chorus's on the cd, and edgy verses that are always fun to listen to... <br />Circle- This is probably my favorite song ont the cd besides Vermilion pt. 2... ( i know that sounds weird cause those happen to be the two acoustic songs, but thats not really why)... this song shows what a TRUE metal band can do though, most bands don't have what it takes to go make a ballad like this, especially with poetic lyrics, where vermilion is more straight up... <br />Welcome- When slipknot makes a song like this you expect better lyrics, like in spit it out, and I think in the back i hear the same sirens that i heard in pulse of the maggots... it is one of the only songs with a solo on the album, but i look forward to when they can play a solo with some meaning and not just speed <br />Vermilion- This song takes hearing a few times to catch on, even though you know it's a full song... I like the lyrics, but he kinda speaks the whole time (which is interesting at a point of view) but with coreys voice, it kinda sucks, another song with a solo though, and a great ending so... <br />Pulse of the Maggots- Aww, how nice, i tribute to us. They must hate their fans... This song is awesome at first, because it sticks out, and its fun to start mosh pits in you basement with a friend to... but after a while you get sick of hearing... WE WONT DIE! considering they alomost killed off theyre fans with this song, in a way, i sound skitzo but i would still give this song an 8... <br />Before I Forget- Sounds like everything else at first, but this has the best bridge on the album by far, and some sweet bends, and a kickass chorus... I would use this song to get someone into slipknot <br />Vermilion Pt. 2- Slipknot has emotions too <br />The Nameless- If you can understand the lyrics and have gone through something similar this song will grasp you, if not, the fast chorus with words that none of us know will grasp you too...(as you grasp a dictionary) <br />The Virus of Life- Great at the end... they could have reconsidered this, I didn't hear a word he said at the begining of this song cuz the beer kegs they were palying overpowered the whispering, but into this song you hear riffs out of some horror movie, which really get your attention if you paly guitar... <br />Danger- Keep Away- I don't get how that title has to do with the songs but whatever... sounds like a church hymm or something but other than that, i don't see anything wrong with it...  <br />and lastly... anyone who dissed slipknot for not being tough enough I'd like to see one of your favorite bands open a pickle jar of dead pidgeon on stage and throw up inside a mask every show....
B0002IVN9W|5.0|...just wow. Imaginative, fresh, colorful, endearing. The Arcade Fire rocks, and then it's barely a whisper. This is one of those \\"under the radar\\" cd's.

0767836286|3.0|What shocks me about many of the movie reviews written on these boards is the apparent blindness to possible political manipulation or propaganda that might exist in any well known movie. Is that to say that hollywood is politcally neutral? Is tim robbins politically neutral? What is the message here? That being white, republican and christian is a dangerous thing? That those who would blow up innocent children are not that far removed from the typical conservative? Certainly. You would have to be an idiot not to see that.    Consider two quotes in this film. One by faraday the bridges character who is teaching a class on domestic terrorism. Referring to the oklahoma city bombing which is depited here as the st luois bombimg faraday puts forth his theory that the killer did not act alone. He says that the killer was a \\"moderate republican.\\" What does that mean? That a real conservative can be expected to kill 300 people? In another quote the robbin's character, the terrorist says \\"there are millions of us\\" and indeed it seems that they are. These pasty faced ultra pale people are everywhere in this film manipulating your children in a boy scout group, following you everywhere you go and listening in on your phone calls. The bad guys are so smart and so large in number that in the end they not only succeed in blowing up a federal building but are able to kill and pin the crime on faraday.     This film a fairly taut thriller with a pleasantly unusaul ending. The good guy doesn't win. Yes it is intense with many ultra close up shots so that you can't see who may be in the background. At first faraday is a little suspicious of his neighbors though he has little reason to be suspicious. And while faraday is far too suspicous it almost seems plausable because of his background as a teacher of terrorists and the fact his fbi wife was killed by them. Still he jumpes to conclusions and finds out what is about to take place but he can't stop it.
0517147688|5.0|...this book includes all of the great Ladies novels, including the often overlooked, \\"Lady Susan\\". Modern readers approaching Austen for the first time are often underwhelmed by the events and the pace of the drama, not entirely difficult to understand given that we need to have our drama so upfront we can smell it these days! Equally just about anything goes in drama today.<br /><br /> There are few taboos and drama reaches us in a multi media fashion. In Austen's time taboo and social order was a plenty and well structured, men and women had distinct roles as did the classes. Society was subtly cruel and unforgiving in it's snobbery and comment upon this was unwelcome. Place these novels in that context and you will love them for Austen is clever and subtle at her sending up and fun poking at this order. Her novels have a sense of justice in which the good triumph and the underhand and sly come undone, whatever their class or station. These kind of novel conclusions seem simple and ideal but it is how she sends up the social order of her time that is her true writIng gift, her tongue was always wedged firmly in her cheek and she can astound, even today, with her wry wit and biting sarcasm. An excellent book and representation of her career.
0765309408|4.0|On his seventy-fifth birthday, John Perry enlists in the army and shortly thereafter leaves Earth forever.<br /><br />Earth is a backwater and the colonies are only interested in new colonists from the countries they prefer-primarily the underdeveloped. The only way for someone from a developed country to get into space is by joining the Colonial Defense Forces, and the only recruits they'll take are people who are seventy-five years old. There's a promise of rejuvenation for all who enlist, and settlement on one of the colony worlds for those who successfully complete their term of service. (The colonies have in some ways much more advanced technology than Earth, and they're mostly not sharing.)<br /><br />The kicker in this wonderful opportunity for ambitious senior citizens is that out among the stars, humanity is fighting for its life. Or at least for its real estate. There are lots of other star-traveling species looking for worlds to settle, and many of them are looking for very similar kinds of worlds. Many of them also have technology significantly more advanced than even the human colony worlds, making life for the infantry pretty much the living hell it usually is.<br /><br />Anyway, John Perry hooks up early one with a few new friends, and they go through the early phases of adjustment to their new lives together. One interesting question that they obesses about for a bit is, how will the CDF rejuvenate their tired old bodies? Everything they come up with just doesn't stand up to close examination, but obviously the CDF thinks they're worth a good bit of expense to recruit and train, so there must be something they've overlooked. The answer comes as a considerable shock to them.<br /><br />The story is basically a foot soldiers in space story, quite well done, and resembling Starship Troopers and Forever War about as much as they resemble each other-amd differing from them as much as they differ from each other. The background is in some ways more interesting: this is a populated and diverse galaxy, with aliens whose motives are sometimes clear and sometimes not, and some of whom  are hostile and some who are friendly or neutral. Even the government they serve is even more of a mystery to Perry and his fellow recruits than is usual for foot soldiers; it's not their government, or wasn't until they enlisted, and residents of Earth never got any meaningful news or information about the colony worlds. This is a fun and interesting book, that comes to a satisfying immediate conclusion, but there are some fascinating questions left hanging, presumably to be addressed in the sequel(s). Some of those questions involve the aliens. The Consu, for instance, always fight at the technological level of the species they're fighting-and if they lose, they leave that planet forever. There are several theories about exactly what they're doing; none of them really make sense, and it's clear that important information is lacking. Other questions involve the CDF and the colonial government. Granted that Perry's fellow recruits can only come from developed countries; why is it that they're all from the U.S.? (There is one semi-exception-a woman not born in the U.S.-but she was apparently raised in the U.S. after certain events in her childhood.) And what's going on with the Special Forces? These are really Special Forces; even the nice, normal ones that we meet are very souped-up versions of human beings, and there are rumors of really different body types and other strange things out there. There's lots going on here, and I'm looking forward to reading more of it.<br /><br />Recommended.interesting: this is a populated and diverse galaxy, with aliens whose motives are sometimes clear and sometimes not, and some of whom  are hostile and some who are friendly or neutral.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|I discovered the song \\"You're Beautiful\\" through some friends in England and I was hooked instantly.  James Blunt has a nice pop-folk quality to his voice who reminds me of 70's artists like Cat Stevens, James Taylor and Jim Croce whom my father listened to often and whose music I grew up with. <br /> <br />My friend from London sent me the CD and it has been on constant playback on my car stereo eversince.  It is totally addicting and I find myself humming the tunes throughout the day. My favorites are \\"You're Beautiful\\" (a lovely song about unrequited love), \\"Cry,\\" \\"Goodbye My Lover\\" and \\"High.\\" In all honestly, there is not a track on this album that I do not like.  The songs are, for the most part, pop ballads with a folk quality about it.  It would be akin to the sound of bands like Travis, Keane and Coldplay though James has a style all his own.   <br /> <br />I hope James Blunt becomes a hit here in the US. He is a hidden gem who has become a hit in the UK and I am pleased to have discovered him.  \\"Back to Bedlam\\" is a superb CD and I highly recommend it!
B000059MEK|4.0|I am personally not really a fan of techno. I am first and foremost a rock fan. However, my girlfriend is in love with techno. So naturally I've listened to some techno since then and then I looked to this album, as I found One More Time and Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger to both be good songs, so I gave the rest of the album a chance and was in for a pleasant surprise, as this ended up being one of my favorite albums.    This album is full of excellent music, both with and without vocals. A great CD overall with catchy tunes.    A song-by-song review:    1. One More Time - The main single of this CD. Everyone's no doubt heard it. And with good reason, a good song overall with well-done vocals. A great song to start off the CD. 8.5/10  2. Aerodynamiac - No doubt the most rock-influenced song on the CD. An excellent beat to start with an amazing guitar solo entering the song to mix in with the beat to make one great sound. No vocals but excellent music. 9/10  3. Digital Love - A ballad, not something you see all the time in techno. This is an amazing song, with excellent vocals to fit the soft mood of the song. The fantasy-romantic lyrics fit so well, starting with \\"Last night I had a dream about you\\" and lines like \\"I don't know what to do/My body's dreaming of you/I hope this dream comes true\\". 10/10  4. Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger - Another single from the CD, a lot of people have heard this one. Excellent song to dance to and one of the most catchy songs on the CD. Just good overall. 9/10  5. Crescendolls - The most repetitive song on the CD, sounding like it came right out of a big party. A decent enough song, but one of the weaker points of the album. 6.5/10  6. Night Vision - Not so much a song as a transition. I don't see much point as it slows down the beat before Superheroes, but eh. 5/10  7. Superheroes - Possibly my favorite song. It starts out slowly getting louder with a drum beat and repetitive vocals. It hits full-force and then goes into an amazing synth beat at the end that is hypnotizing. Great song overall and one of the best. 10/10  8. High Life - A decent song, but too repetitive. Catchy song. 6.5/10  9. Something About Us - Another one of the great songs on the CD, obviously a love song like Digital Love. Excellent bass used in this song with a good use of vocals. It then trails off into a good beat. 9/10  10. Voyager - An instrumental song and an interesting one at that. Very space-y futuristic feel to the song. Good to chill out too. 6/10  11. Veridis Quo - A very soft instrumental that pairs well with voyager. However, at nearly 6 minutes long it tends to get a little boring. 6/10  12. Short Circuit - The best instrumental song on the CD, just sounds very cool. It's one of the more fast-paced songs on the album and just has a cool beat with good synthesizer rhythms. Excellent all around. 9.5/10  13. Face to Face - The vocals sound like a pop song, but that doesn't necessarily make it bad. With an excellent beat and good vocals in the song, this is one of the better songs on the CD. A good song leading into the end and one of the best on the CD. 10/10  14. Too Long - Like Face to Face, another vocaled song that ends the album. The title is somewhat fitting, at 10 minutes long. However, with good reason, it goes on and switches to something different in each verse, giving it an \\"epic\\" feel. A good way to end the album and a great song all around 9.5/10    Bottom line, this is a good CD. If you're not much into techno and want to give it a shot, this album would be a good way to start as it has something for everyone. With 14 songs, it has a good amount of music and is definitley worth listening too. This CD shows the good part of the techno genre.
B00005JNQA|4.0|Despite mixed reviews, I wanted to see THE INTERPRETER as soon as I discovered the United Nations had actually allowed director Sydney Pollack unprecedented permission to film on location in the U.N. Building.  Just seeing the inside of the U.N. Building for the first time since I moved from NYC would have made the film worth the price of admission for me, so I was pleasantly surprised when this story of a South African interpreter (Nicole Kidman) embroiled in an assassination plot when she overhears the wrong thing at the wrong time turned out to be a suspenseful, thought-provoking, character-driven thriller that builds up a nice head of paranoia.  THE INTERPRETER's drama is primarily of the cerebral kind, almost a throwback to 1970s thrillers like THE PARALLAX VIEW and Pollack's own THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR, which is not to say there aren't some suspenseful chases and set pieces.  The jewel in its crown is a nail-bitingly tense sequence on a Brooklyn bus that recalls Alfred Hitchcock's SABOTAGE, even if it *did* beg the question of why an expatriate African political figure (LAYER CAKE's George Harris) involved in hot-button issues would let himself be seen going on a city bus as part of his daily routine, as seen in a newspaper in the film...but I digress... I suspect that most of the negative reviews I'd heard came from folks who resent actually being asked to pay attention to dialogue instead of waiting for stuff to blow up real good.  It was refreshing to see the evolution of the relationship between our heroine and the troubled, all-too-recently widowed Secret Service agent (Sean Penn, reminiscent of a young Marlon Brando here) who's assigned to protect her, their initial wariness thawing into a tender friendship without the pair actually tumbling into bed together.  I've always found Penn a hard actor to warm up to, but Kidman's sympathetic presence has a good effect on him; the two work well together.  I also liked that our heroine, who after all makes her living choosing words carefully, has many fascinating lines about the meaning of words and the nuances of language (one of my favorites:  \\"If I interpreted `dead' as `gone,' I'd be out of a job.  `Dead' and `gone' are two different things.\\")  As Penn's fellow agent, Catherine Keener gets some choice dialogue, too; a scene-stealer in her offhanded way, she's like the Eve Arden of the Secret Service.  If you're in the mood for an intelligent thriller concerned with issues and not just a rollercoaster ride on a movie screen, and filmed in ever-photogenic NYC to boot, THE INTERPRETER is very much worth seeing and hearing. I'm looking forward to getting ahold of the DVD this fall. (For what it's worth, my husband wondered why they didn't cast native South African Charlize Theron in the title role.  I figured it was because she was busy making AEON FLUX, and besides, the role would be a bigger stretch for Nicole Kidman than for someone who already had a South African accent! :-)living choosing words carefully, has many fascinating lines about the meaning of words and the nuances of language (one of my favorites:  \\"If I interpreted `dead' as `gone,' I'd be out of a job.  `Dead' and `gone' are two different things.\\")  As Penn's fellow agent, Catherine Keener gets some choice dialogue, too; a scene-stealer in her offhanded way, she's like the Eve Arden of the Secret Service.

0553062182|5.0|What a blessing, and a relief, to find this book a few years ago.  As a middle-aged adult who always felt herself flawed because of my \\"overly-sensitive nature,\\" this book was like a breath of fresh air.  Finally, I understand why I am so attune to the subtleties in my environment, why I am very sensitive to pain, why I quickly become drained around crowds, why I am uncomfortable with loud noises and why a few hours of daily solitude are as essential to me as food and water.  HSP's intense arousal to stimuli that goes unobserved by others (sounds, sights, physical sensations) isn't due to a personality flaw in our makeup, but due to the way our brain functions and the way it processes information.<br /><br />One particularly helpful chapter is the one on Social Relationships.  According to the book, approximately 75% of the US population is very socially outgoing.  This extroverted population often sees the highly sensitive person as being 'stand-offish,' overly emotional, or afraid of being rejected.  HSPs are generally very loving individuals, who are also very cautious and intuitive when it comes to relationships -- we do not give our affections lightly, which should be viewed as a strength rather than a weakness.  And, while we do sometimes get caught up in our emotions and fear rejection, those qualities are not unique to HSPs.  There are often quite different motivators at work in our actions...such as too much arousal, the need to be alone, etc.  This book explains these facts very thoroughly and delves more deeply into the psyche of the HSP than any I've ever read.<br /><br />This book is also helpful for couples.  As a counselor, I recommended this book to a married couple considering divorce.  The husband, not the wife, was the HSP.  After reading the book, a ray of light broke through for this couple.  The husband finally came to understand himself on a level never before experienced, and the wife came to understand that her husband was not an \\"overly-sensitive wimp just seeking attention.\\"  It made a huge impact on their marriage and they were able to use the book as a jumping off point from the merry-go-round of criticism and pain upon which they had been trapped for years.<br /><br />I once read a quote which said, \\"No one who has not a complete knowledge of himself will ever have a true understanding of another.\\"  I echo that sentiment and highly recommend this book to introverts who may be struggling with feelings of being 'less-than' due to their shyness or heightened sensitivity to criticism or emotional pain.  This book is very capable of changing your life.<br /><br />The only caution I would have is that many of the personality traits described in the book may also apply to individuals struggling with emotional, physical or sexual abuse issues.  If that is your case, I highly recommend you receive counseling from a qualified professional in addition to, or possibly before, reading this book.sitive wimp just seeking attention.\\"  It made a huge impact on their marriage and they were able to use the book as a jumping off point from the merry-go-round of criticism and pain upon which they had been trapped for years.<br /><br />I once read a quote which said, \\"No one who has not a complete knowledge of himself will ever have a true understanding of another.\\"  I echo that sentiment and highly recommend this book to introverts who may be struggling with feelings of being 'less-than' due to their shyness or heightened sensitivity to criticism or emotional pain.

B00005JNSK|5.0|When my husband and I heard that Tim Burton was making a new film version of Roald Dahl's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (C&tCF) starring his favorite leading man Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the world's quirkiest candy maker, we knew it would be a perfect match of filmmakers and source material, and indeed it is! Burton's inventive imagination and dark, twisted sense of humor suits Dahl's gleeful misogyny perfectly, yet still results in a family-friendly film simply because, like Depp's Willy Wonka, it doesn't pander to the young'uns. Indeed, Wonka doesn't even seem to like the golden-ticket-winning kids he invites to his weird and wonderful confection factory (so much for comparisons to Michael Jackson :-), though in his own oddball way Wonka eventually warms up to our hero Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Who wouldn't like the selfless, poor-but-thankful-for-his-blessings Charlie, especially compared to the four spoiled brats competing against him for the unnamed \\"special prize\\" Wonka dangles before them? The kids' acting styles work well, with young Highmore's un-actorish, down-to-earth quality playing off well against the appropriately flamboyant brattiness of AnnaSophia Robb (as super-competitive Violet Beauregarde), Julia Winter (Veruca Salt, the overindulged rich kid with the false sense of entitlement), Jordan Fry (Mike Teevee, who is now an aggressive video game freak as well as a television addict) and Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop, a sweet-faced but selfish glutton). Wonka is also given a back story of funny yet poignant strife with dad Christopher Lee, a dentist (!) who takes his work just a little too seriously. This could have been as overly sweet as a bad piece of candy, but the actors, Burton, and screenwriter John August work it gracefully into the family theme; unlike Wonka, Charlie has a loving relationship with his eccentric family, all played with warmth and wit by a cast of fascinating faces, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor as Charlie's dad, and Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's cabbage-soup-making mom. It helps that Depp and Highmore have good chemistry. (Fun Fact: Depp recommended Highmore to Burton after working with the lad in FINDING NEVERLAND. Another FN veteran in C&tCF: Eileen Essell of DUPLEX fame, playing Charlie's Grandma Josephine.) With Alex McDowell's production design, Philippe Rousselot's lush photography, and Gabriella Pescucci's costume design, the movie is deliriously gorgeous to look at, like a collaboration between Edward Gorey and Peter Max. Thanks to the deadpan performance (or should I say performances? :-) of a CGI-multiplied Deep Roy and Danny Elfman's fabulously fun score -- with songs based on lyrics from Roald Dahl himself, yet stylistically reminiscent of Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo (no cover versions of \\"The Candy Man,\\" sorry! :-) -- the Oompa-Loompas' production numbers are a delight to watch and listen to.

B0002687T8|5.0|UK dancepop duo Moloko are in fine form in \\"Things to Make And Do,\\" their third blend of acid jazz and trippy electronica. The talented Roisin Murphy and Mark Brydon create a charmingly erratic dance album that sounds like nothing else, yet never fails to draw you in.<br /><br />It opens with a peculiar piano solo, before kicking into the sexy sax-keyboard of \\"Pure Pleasure Seeker,\\" and the ominously trippy \\"Absent Minded Friends.\\" A darker note enters with songs like \\"Being Is Bewildering,\\" which is technically a more \\"normal\\" song, a slow and rather melancholy song based on acoustic guitar and organ. Same with the lower-key pop song \\"The Time is Now.\\"<br /><br />There are also some more experimental songs, such as the nonsensical funk of \\"Indigo\\" or the creepy psycho-vocals of \\"If You Have A Cross To Bear You May As Well Use It As A Crutch.\\" \\"Remain the Same\\" is perhaps the most experimental, with the vocal sampling and sound of the organ being overwhelmed and sunk by the electronic bleeps.<br /><br />In this release, Moloko downplays the outright weirdness in favor of a more subtle sound. Call it experimental ultraquirk acid-jazz-funk-house-trip-hop. That more or less describes it. It's not just a fun album, but a richly engaging one with some deceptively simple-sounding songwriting.<br /><br />Roisin (no, it doesn't rhyme with \\"raisin\\") Murphy has an excellent voice for this type of music -- it sounds clear and flexible, while being strong enough to rise over powerful music that could have overwhelmed her. And she brings depth to certain songs like \\"Mother,\\" where she lashes out at her mother in a restrained manner: \\"I know somehow somewhere I'll be bumping into you/you see I'm blameless/I had a mother who was shameless/no wonder my life collapsed!\\" Elsewhere the songwriting is just deliciously bizarre.<br /><br />Mark Brydon takes charge of the musical backdrop for Roisin's voice. And a fine job he does too, blending organic instrumentation like piano, acoustic guitar and rippling strings with some vocal sampling and deliciously wacked-out beats, sounding like anything from a DJ on acid to the funkier twin of Portishead.<br /><br />Erratic it may be, but \\"Things to Make And Do\\" is also fun, wild and extremely eclectic, switching styles the way most musicians do instruments.

0385513755|5.0|From the very first chapter to the last, Dan Brown delivers a tale of intrigue, murder, and suspense that keeps you glued to the pages.  It took me a while to get to this book because I thought it would be too time consuming and require more from me than I was willing to give.  I was wrong, dead wrong.  I actually found it to be a fast and furious read.  Once you start, be prepared to be pre-occupied with the characters and the story's progression until you read the very last word.  My 16 year old daughter read it at my insistence and has been recommending it to her friends every chance she gets.<br /><br />I have found a new favorite author and look forward to catching up on his previous works.  Dan Brown has a style that captures your imagination and brings you so deep within the pages, you end up feeling as though you were an active participant, not just a spectator.

B0001KL5DA|5.0|This has to be my all time favorite TV show. I am counting the days until season 4 arrives on the shelves and it's been a long, hard wait. This family is the epitome of dysfunction and watching their lives unfold can only make you grateful for your own, hopefully more sane life.<br /><br />I enjoyed the first season on DVD having never seen it on HBO and I don't think I ever got up to do anything else. I devoured all 13 episodes immediately went looking for season 2.  I am afraid season 2 wasn't much different.  I had to have it all at once and couldn't stop until it was over.  This could be a problem I'll have to deal with eventually but for now, there's still season 3.<br /><br />With its very adult subject matter, this is not a show for kids. Be prepared to get addicted
630157401X|5.0|I just love this film! It shows the character and theme have been allowed to develope & grow. (Not many \\"series\\" movies are so lucky!)Altogether a great Saturday film! Well done to all hands concerned! I just hope that there is more films of this quality in the pipeline.
0393317552|5.0|Having read his impressive treatise on societal self-preservation, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\", I was immediately drawn to Jared Diamond's earlier book, which has an even more ambitious scope in excavating the roots of civilization and how distinct priorities have defined the differences in societies. Beginning with a survey of human pre-history, covering the spread of humans around the world circa 11,000 B.C., he tries to ascertain which populations would develop dominant high-tech societies and which would continue at a stone-age level indefinitely. It's a fascinating premise that the UCLA evolutionary biologist and molecular physiologist carries off with credibility and aplomb. He effortlessly synthesizes history, archaeology, agriculture, linguistics, medicine and many other fields into an overall thesis that seems persuasive at its core, even if there are several observations that would be difficult to evaluate as completely true.<br /><br />The book's title reflects the three primary factors Diamond identifies as the key differentiators: the military technology to dominate one's neighbors, the infectious diseases that weaken societies not already exposed to them, and the industrial and political technology in areas that include literacy, economic and political structures, and manufacturing. Each chapter would make an intriguing book on its own. In one section, Diamond convincingly argues why domestication spreads more easily in areas with an east-west axis, where latitude remains the same, than in areas such as the Americas where a north-south axis requires domesticated species to adjust to different lengths of day and drastic climate changes. As an example, he states that corn from Mexico requires a longer growing season than the climate of Minnesota provides, and llamas did poorly in the Central American jungles and thus never reached more hospitable regions in North America. In contrast, goats were domesticated early in the Middle East and spread quickly from Spain to China.<br /><br />I was particularly drawn to his theories on social technology, in which Diamond suggests that denser populations required more complex methods of conflict resolution and more efficient means to distribute food. Better distribution and reduced conflict subsequently supported the elite class, who could then develop writing, accounting, and military strategies, consequently passing the learning of one generation efficiently to the next. Probably Diamond's most compelling thinking is focused on innovation, i.e., on how new technologies are put to new uses in a domino fashion. Examples he cites include the fact that the alphabet was streamlined from hieroglyphs and how Gutenberg's printing press was adapted from presses used to make wine. He shows how innovations can be spread through trade, copied by inventive observers, or acquired by conquest. For example, Chinese papermaking came to the Islamic world when an Arab army defeated a Chinese army at the battle of Talas River in 751 A.D. and found several papermakers among the prisoners of war. Obscure historical facts suddenly expose themselves as part of a larger social fabric.<br /><br />What I find most interesting is how Diamond shows how technology did not provide a global sense of manifest destiny, that in fact technology is sometimes abandoned or rejected by certain societies. Japan rejected firearms because they violated the samurai code.  Polynesian settlers lost the ability to make pottery as they scattered across the Pacific islands. Many factors contributed to this loss, including lack of materials on many islands and reduced population densities that presumably made it difficult to train specialized workers. Between this book and \\"Collapse\\", it's impressive how Diamond moves confidently among so many disciplines. However, he does shortchange religion perhaps because the topic does not interest him. He simply objectifies religion as a justification for conquest and a method of inspiring personal sacrifice for the collective good. I just feel he underestimates the impact. But amazingly, this omission is trivial given the breadth of what Diamond presents here as he presents the ultimate differences in levels of development between societies. In his view, the reasons trace all the way back to how the world was built. Strongly recommended.spiring personal sacrifice for the collective good. I just feel he underestimates the impact.

B00009P1O2|5.0|You want real rock and roll?...in your room?...like you have never ever ever seen or heard before? This is the ultimate statement of a live rock concert...it captures you...it holds you...it thrills you...there is nothing out there that can compare to this performance. Absolutely nothing. I noted that a few reviewers had a few nitpiks..all I can say is they were listening on a ghetto blaster and watching on a 12 inch b&amp;w tv or they are deaf dumb and blind...even at that I would give it five stars...but seriously this is a gem...a must have... great sound in DTS...very good video...but regardless the performance takes you...incredible...God save the Queen...we miss you Freddie.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|While it was not a new concept for a band to to put all there best songs on one album, Van Halen certainly did this well. Van Halen Was formed by two brothers, Alex and Edward Van Halen from Holland. They Formed a band called Mammoth after recruiting two Americans after moving there (Pasadena,California), Micheal Anthony on bass and David Lee Roth providing the vocals. They later landed a record label (after floping with a demo produced by Gene Simmons) and they released this album. Read on for my review of VAN HALEN I<br /><br />1  Runnin' With The Devil ***** one of my favourites<br />2  Eruption ***** Does it get any better than this?<br />3  You Really Got Me **** very catchy<br />4  Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love ***** great song<br />5  I'm The One **** awsomeness<br />6  Jamie's Cryin' **** slower than the rest, still kick ass<br />7  Atomic Punk **** very tough, dig the lyrics<br />8  Feel Your Love Tonight *** really poppy, its still good<br />9  Little Dreamer ***** i love this song!, bone-crushing riff<br />10  Ice Cream Man *** my least favourite,the solo saves the song<br />11  On Fire **** a great way to end a great album, i really<br />  like the chorus on this one, 3 words \\" I'm On FIIIYAH \\"<br /><br />A Fantastic debut from a band fortunate enough to be in collaberation with one of the greatest guitar players ever(Eddie)! Check this one out, if you cant afford to buy up Van Halens whole catolouge, dont have a heart-attack and just pace yourself. The fanomanal tracks may begin here but they certainly dont end here so start here and work your way up (all there best are here, its just a figure of speech).<br /><br />Long live a guitar master!
B00005AQE8|5.0|Like many others, I believe that All Eyez on Me is one of the greatest, possibly the greatest rap album, to have been released. This double disc has amazing production with Tupac coming out strong, along with various guests. Songs like How do U Want It, 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted, All Bout U and Ambitionz az a Ridah will keep this album remembered for a long time. The only song I dont like on this album is \\"Whatz Ya Phone #\\". It just has no place on this album. 10/10 album! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNSK|5.0|I was skeptical about viewing this movie. I figured it would either be a real stinker and a waste of time and money or it would be great...this movie was GREAT!! (do you like my Tony the Tiger impression?) <br /> <br />Though the original and this one are parallel and do cross paths at times...really they are truly too completely different shows. The effects are wonderful and the acting is top notch. I laughed and cried throughout the entire picture. <br /> <br />Originally I went to see it because of David Kelly (from Waking Ned Devine...the next movie you should see!!) and Christopher Lee (Count Dooku from Star Wars...plus many many wonderful earlier films.) There are so many actors in it that I knew but didn't expect to see there...WHAT a TREAT! <br /> <br />It is quite dark and scary in parts which is why I wouldn't recommend it for anyone under 10yrs, but if you are older than that run don't walk to the theater and check it out! Preferably at a drive in like we did!  ENJOY!!  <br /> <br />PS. My husband LOVED it (even though he really didn't want to go) I have heard him laugh that hard in months!!
B00005JNSK|4.0|If hardcore fans tell you that it did not live up to the orginal, well their either too upset or they just can not take good remakes. Yes we know its nowhere close to the book, and its a different version of Gene Wilder version. This is a TIM BURTON FILM. Its going to be totally different. The Ending was heartwarming. I had never scene Christopher Lee in a non-villian short role. Christopher Lee always played an absolute evil villian in all his films, but in this he plays the father of Willy Wonka, and a father who felt that he lost a son. The story is fantastic, and Johnny Depp is amazing. He once again proves himself to be a genius. One of the greatest children stories gets a make over and let me tell you, it lives up to the orginal and then some. Please if you have read the book and watched the orginal Gene Wilder film as I did, I advise you to wipe your memory and begin fresh. If you don't you'll JUST START PIN POINTING ASPECTS IN THIS VERSION!!! Please your just upsetting yourself if you do that. Go see it for what it is. Do not expect it to be exactly like the orginal. Its not! Its a different and more heartwarming version!
B0002DB52M|3.0|This film is unlike any other, including any other by Von Trier.  It is deeply flawed in execution but, at the same time, exhilaratingly fresh in inspiration.  I watched it for the first time last night and wasn't bored for a single minute.  Any film that so obviously concerns itself with exploring ideas and which, at the same time, manages to be so entertaining has to command respect. <br /> <br />At the same time, I am convinced that at heart this film has no meaning-or that it has so many contradictory meanings that they effectively cancel each other out.  Is it an allegory of the Last Judgment?  Only if you believe that God is an implacable mobster bent on sadistic sport and Jesus his spiteful emissary-in other words, fallen sinners.  How about a socialist screed revolving around the class struggle?  Only if you're willing to ignore the fact that most of the exploiters are themselves exploited proletarians and that the major character's victimization is often more emotional than material. <br /> <br />Perhaps the film works best as a conservative critique of classical liberalism, with its final insistence on personal responsibility and its insistence on the \\"arrogance\\" of forgiveness, when forgiveness implies the moral superiority of she or he who forgives and the inherent inferiority of the parties requiring forgiveness. <br /> <br />The problem I have with the film is not with its multiplicity of possible interpretations.  It lies in the director's constant confusion of the moral and aesthetic dimensions.  In a film that is so obviously concerned with the human capacity for choosing good or evil, it is disconcerting to say the least to constantly be pulled in the direction of the aesthetic.  And make no mistake, this film is an aesthetic triumph.  The set is beautiful.  The most casual effects, such as the fine dusting of snow or the light appearing through the clouds at the end of the film, achieve visual sublimity occurring as they do in such an austere setting.  The compositions are rigorous and exacting as those encountered in Giacometti's metaphysical palaces and consistently arrest the eye with unimpeded vanishing points and breathtaking arrangements of artfully chosen visual props.  But what does any of this have to do with either/or? <br /> <br />The actors make a brave attempt to cast off their instincts and training to become like Bresson models, so that Von Trier can achieve his Brechtian alienation strategy.  Mostly they succeed.  Nicole is magnificent, as good as Emily Watson in \\"Breaking the Waves\\" and that's really saying something. <br /> <br />Finally, if anyone thinks this film isn't about the good old USA, they didn't stay until the final credits.  The choice of images from the Depression, spiraling downward to racist atrocities in the 60's, was another deliberate aesthetic choice by the director-one of many quixotic choices that will have people discussing this movie for years to come. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNSK|4.0|As I was watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, it occurred to me that this review would basically conclude that this version of the movie adds absolutely nothing to the old version, Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory, starring Gene Wilder and Jack Albertson.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the plot, Willy Wonka runs a Chocolate Factory, but no one has been allowed inside with him for years.  He distributes 5 golden tickets randomly in shipments of chocolate bars.  The children who find the tickets will win a tour of the factory.  Young charlie is one of the lucky kids, from a very poor home, who finds a golden ticket.  The tour commences and the kids - each with one adult family member - see strange and wondrous things inside the candy factory.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is probably the best actor available for the role, almost ideal, some would say - but not better, for this particular role of Willy Wonka, than Wilder.  Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers of movie scores, especially Tim Burton movies, but in this case his music is actually worse than in the old film.  And the dancing rock numbers of the Oompa Loompa's is horrendous.  The old film was in color, had decent art direction and special effects, fine acting, and both films follow essentially the same plot, with minor variations, not much funnier in the new film.  Plus they left out the \\"Candy Man\\" song, one of my favorite parts of the old version. And so I would have given the film only 3 stars, for it's almost as good as the original, though unnecessary since it's not better, and then one less star because I missed \\"The Candy Man.\\"<br /><br />But then the end came, and then they DID add more in this version, and it's good - morally and emotionally satisfying - and it involves Christopher Lee.  So I'm giving it 4 stars and recommend it for the whole family and everybody.  And the old version as well.

B000021XS0|5.0|Well, maybe not.  While the story line is interesting, I often got the feeling that telling a story got in the way of the songwriting.  This is probably the only DT disc where not one song makes sense outside the context of the entire album (a trap that Pink Floyd never fell into, by the way).  But that is probably the only really serious failing here. <br /> <br />Musically, Dream Theater is amazing.  I probably don't really have to say that, but I'll say it anyway.  Every time a new DT album comes out, it makes me really question whether Geddy Lee and Neil Peart are still the best rhythm section in rock (although it will take a lot more combos of the caliber of Myung and Portnoy to knock them out of the top five).  John Petrucci is easily the best guitarist of the last ten or fifteen years, and while he can shred with the best of them he's equally adept at making his guitar sing (check his solo in \\"The Spirit Carries On\\").  And the addition of Jordan Rudess on keys for this album was a smart one; he does a lot more than the standard piano/organ/fake strings tonalities (the ragtime piano break in \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" is among his more whimsical touches). <br /> <br />This CD really requires an album-length attention span to appreciate, so it isn't the best choice if you're new to DT.  But if you've heard them before and have gotten a taste, you owe it to yourself to buy this one.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Wow.  I can't believe how dissapointing this album was.  I thought BYOB was a great song, and I rushed to the store to but this album the day it came out, and even after I listened to the CD for the first time I tried to tell myself I liked it, but sadly I did not.  How could the band that produced Toxicity, a divine muscial creation that seemed to come from the hand of God himself, produce this load of crap?  They definitely slumped into a decline on this latest album.  Toxicity was a masterpiece, poetic and sublime, but Mesmerize seems like  a huge clash of metal thrown together by a band that has gone insane after their previous successes.  What the hell?  I can't believe so many people have given such good reviews to this album.  You all must be a bunch of idiots - either that or a bunch of burn outs.  Do you all really get that excited over a rush of metallic sounds and angry lyrics?  What other crap do you guys listen to?  I can just imagine a group of you morons sitting clustered together in a little room reaking of sweat and pot-smoke just listening to this album and chuckling amidst little statements like \\"Holy sh*t dude!  Do you hear this?  It's totally trippy!  It's all loud and sh*t man!  Holy sh*t we're so bad and awesome for listening to this!\\"  All the while you're all twitching with delight over the thought of how abrasive the music is and how less emotionally pathetic people will cringe from you and the sounds that you assault your ears with.  I didn't mean for this review to end in mass character assasination, but you are all truly a bunch of assclowns.
B00005UEAR|5.0|As much as I love Dream Theater (and the progressive rock genre as a whole), I'm probably not the biggest DT geek here.  So far this is the only DT disc I bought the day it was released, and I still don't own all of their releases.  Don't worry, I'm working on that.  Now let me talk about this album. <br /> <br />For total running time, this is the longest studio set DT has released.  In a way it picks up where SFAM leaves off; SFAM ends with LP record surface noise, 6DOIT begins with a blast of white noise.  The opening track, \\"The Glass Prison\\", is among the most intense songs I've heard from DT (as I said above, I haven't heard 'em all yet).  And on top of the great instrumental performances from everyone, there's some really great writing here. <br /> <br />Honestly, there isn't a single bad song on this entire set.  And unlike SFAM, the individual sections of the title track work on their own (I especially like \\"The Test That Stumped Them All\\" and \\"About to Crash (Reprise)\\").  But if I have to pick a favorite, it would have to be \\"Disappear.\\"  This is one of the few songs I've heard that brings tears to my eyes, particularly after losing my grandmother this year. <br /> <br />Overall, this is another great album from a band that refuses to stand still.
0767821769|4.0|Stepmom can be slated by people who don't have a heart, but this is one of the best Julia Roberts movies out there. Ed Harris, Susan Sarandon & Julia all do extremely well in this, as do the kids. Jena Malone plays the little girl, and Liam Aiken (Object Of My Affection, Sweet November) plays her younger brother.<br /><br />I have to say this movie makes me cry every single time. And once you've seen the movie once, you'll start crying earlier & earlier in the movie each time. It's amazing.<br /><br />Julia & Susan work so well on this film together, that I can't imagine anyone else in their roles. Their love/hate relationship is so good, you actually believe it. The cold stares (something Susan's fabulous at!) make you shiver. And the crying, god, as soon as they start, that's me. Watch out for the conversation about the wedding, if that doesn't get you going nothing will.<br /><br />This is a truly excellent film, and I'm not going to ruin it anymore for anyone who hasn't seen it. Just make sure the tissues are filled up, and you're either wearing waterproof mascara or none at all.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Unbelievable. Simply unbelievable. <br />How talented is Sufjan Stevens? It's awe-inspiring how much heart and human emotion he packs in every single note and word that he writes. <br /> <br />Michigan and Seven Swans were fantastic, but Illinois is an absolute masterpiece. This is the best record I've heard this year. I hope that he gets around to writing about the other 48 states. I'll buy each and every one with no hesitation. <br /> <br />What an artist.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is probably one of the best CD's that she made. I like all the songs on this record. It contains many many ballads and they're all very good. I've bought this cd about a 4 months ago and I've played it almost every day. This CD is a classic, you'll never get tired of it. This is Mimi's best-selling record to date. Maybe \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" could do better, but it will be hard. <br /> <br />My favorite tracks are: <br />1) Fantasy: this is such a beautiful song, MC sounds really good in this uptempo song <br />2) One Sweet Day: this song was a huge hit and it still sounds so good after all these years. <br />3) Looking In: she sings this song so good, it's the best ballad on this cd <br />4) Open Arms: a very beautiful song, great lyrics <br />5) Always Be My Baby: this song makes me happy <br /> <br />The other songs on \\"Daydream\\" are so so good. I will listen to \\"Daydream\\" for many years to come. It's worth your money!!
B0001O3YD0|5.0|At some point, most fantasy movies tend to go overboard with their stories -  you're going along with a great story, able to suspend your disbelief, and then they throw in some of what I like to call, \\"woo-woo,\\" and ruin an otherwise excellent film.  Pitch Black, to me, is a perfect, great movie, and I also completely admired The Chronicles of Riddick.  They are quintessential action-fantasy movies for the thinking person who likes a little butt-kicking in their movies.  However, the Director's Cut of Chronicles of Riddick has some woo-woo and it does not at all improve the story.  When the woman who is the woo-woo consciousness of the murdered babies of Fuyria (sp?) puts her hand on Riddick and causes him to blow up a group of attacking Necromongers, it is silly.  When the Purifier rips open his shirt to show a glowing blue woo-woo handprint to compare it the handprint on Riddick's chest, it adds an unexpected, uninteresting, and possibly unintended homoerotic note to the film.  I didn't check to see whether this Director's Cut Chronicles of Riddick DVD also contains the theatre version, but I hope it does.  Otherwise, I'll be compelled to buy the theatre version instead.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I used these headpones last night. I've been a DJ @ a nightclub for 4 years and these are by far the best headphones I've had that were sub $20. They do well at blocking out outside noise as well as great range response in what you hear and it's well capable of boiling your brain from the volume level it's capable of producing!
B000002HK4|5.0|I have a confession to make. <br /> <br />I originally bought this disc because it contained a cover of Elton John's \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding.\\"  Now, mind you, I love Dream Theater on their own merits, but this is my favorite Elton John track.  The album it appears on (Goodbye Yellow Brick Road) is the only one of Sir Elton's albums I own.  I wanted to see how such a great song would turn out in the hands of such a capable act as Dream Theater. <br /> <br />Well, as it turns out, perhaps DT isn't the most imaginitive cover band in the world.  Nearly all of the live cover versions on the second half of this disc are played pretty close to the original; the only real departure is on \\"Perfect Strangers\\" where they drop another fourth (maybe DP didn't do this because Fender doesn't make a 7-string Stratocaster?).  And, frankly, as much as I love his singing, James LaBrie's wailing over the outro is rather irritating. <br /> <br />But a great original track more than atones for all the sins on the live half.  \\"A Change of Seasons\\" is probably the best long track the guys have done, and despite some amazing instrumental breaks I never got the feeling that they were soloing simply for the hell of it.  It is still one of my favorite Dream Theater songs to this day.
B000002C25|5.0|More and more, I begin to see Oasis as one of the only bands, well, ever, that brings a consistently optimistic message. It's not every day you hear lyrics like: \\"All around the world / you gotta spread the word / tell em what you heard / you know it's gonna be okay.\\" <br /> <br />Mind you, this isn't _why_ the album is good. It's good because it's unique and well-executed, and the songs are great. Overall, it might not be as great a musical achievement as Def-Mab or Morning Glory, but it's a great listen - and the kind of thing that has a tendancy to become a part of one's life. <br /> <br />Be Here Now is over seventy minutes long, with only two real songs clocking in at under four minutes. The long format is usually better suited to either techno or classical, so it's interested to see it attempted here with (admittedly) fairly standard rock, stretching the limites of the traditional verse-chorus-verse-chorus-fade. A few songs drag, but most only grow more powerful the longer they run. They demand to be taken seriously, not as just as music, but as statements on life. In a way, the album is very high-concept. <br /> <br />The definite winners are Stand By Me, and the two long kickers D'You Know What I Mean? and Be Here Now. All Around the World may be too sappy for a few, but I found it heartfelt. After its amazing seven minutes, though, the equally long and upbeat It's Getting Better (Man!) seems almost unncessary, although it's a good song in its own right. Finally you have a two-minute orchestral reprise of All Around, sampling the 1812 overture. If you've been following the album, it's the perfect closer, so deliriously over-the-top it make you laugh and smile at the same time. If you haven't, it probably pushes it hopelessly into the territory of kitsch. <br /> <br />So while it may not be for everyone, Be Here Now is certainly a worthy addition to Oasis' catalogue and a daring follow-up to Morning Glory. Recommended. <br /> <br />
6304806434|5.0|Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it.<br /><br />Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.<br /><br />On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a men on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat.<br /><br />As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.<br /><br />Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there.

B00064MW6K|4.0|Possibly the worst, most entertaining movie i've ever seen.  Seriously, i was on in a fitworks dark room and I ended up going on the exercise machine for the entire hour and a half. Never happened before and will never happen again, but I just couldn't bring myself to leave.  <br /> <br />So, basically, what was everyone expecting?  An award winning Titanic?  I mean, it's called \\"catwoman\\" and has halle berry in a tight leather cat suit.  Give it a break.  It's fun, action packed entertainment with a really really corny plot. So go into it, knowing what it is, and don't be so hard on it.  Unlike some movies that are actually supposed to be all \\"deep\\" and \\"masterpieces\\", this movie was actually interesting, not to say those aren't, but a lot of them can put people to sleep in minutes.  <br /> <br />However, I was impressed by the visual effects of some scenes.  They were like, wow, that's cool.  More if you're an artsy type of person but they were just, very pretty.  And the romance was surprisingly cute. I really liked seeing the two of them on the screen. <br /> <br />My one and only complaint is that i have a cat and this movie had the most uncat like catwoman ever.  Dont know if you've ever seen the batman catwoman, but now that was a cat.  She's like \\"meow\\" and struts around real slow hitting things.  Doesn't move too much.   <br /> <br />This catwoman crawled on ceilings and moved at lightening speeds, hopping on walls.  My cat has still never done that, and I dont know too many cats that do. She also kept jumping around and moving and doing acrobat flips and couldn't sit still for a single second, while my cat just sleeps in a ball for seventeen hours a day, stretches, then moves somewhere else and goes back to sleep.  Cats don't move ever. Make a mental note of that should catwoman ever be reborn for the third time. they also fit like, one half a kitty nibble in their mouth at a time, and lick at the surface juice of a can of cat food. they don't shove in a dozen giant shrimps. They eat.... very... tiny... bits.... at a time. So, all i kept thinking was, this is the worst cat i've ever seen. try harder.  <br /> <br />cute movie though.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a very enchanting, emotional, and fantastic movie. I laughed. I cried.  \\"My heart blew up like a balloon.\\" (I'm quoting a movie there.)<br /><br />Johnny Depp is such an amazing actor, and he brought J.M. Barrie to life in a wonderful way.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Barrie, Peter Pan, and fantastically filmed movies that the whole family can enjoy, rent it, buy it!<br /><br />You will enjoy the journey to Neverland.<br /><br />Eileen Famiglietti
B000002JPA|4.0|This was the album that introduced me to Dream Theater.  Thank you, MTV, for actually playing a video from a band with real prowess. <br /> <br />I don't consider this the best DT album (read the reviews and you'll find plenty who disagree with me).  But it does contain hints of what made their later releases so good.  There's a level of musicianship on this album that is simply astonishing, especially when you consider this album came out during the height of the grunge craze.  Along with that, there are some really good hooks; I can remember hearing \\"Pull Me Under\\" on the radio fairly regularly when this album was released, and it isn't even the ONLY catchy song here.  There's one good epic track (\\"Metropolis Pt. I\\", which was later expanded upon to become a complete album).  And there is plenty of good stuff elsewhere. <br /> <br />Check it out if you've heard of these guys, but haven't actually heard them.
B0006A9FKA|2.0|Just got done watching this movie and I must <br />say it was a real underachiever... Why? I can <br />understand the movie didn't have a deep plot <br />and I wasn't expecting one. But the humor was <br />mediocre to say the least. <br /> <br />The lead guy was ok and the overweight dude <br />was ok, but the rest of the cast was one of <br />the worst I had ever seen. None of the other <br />guys brought anything to the table. They <br />acted very poorly and I was hoping all of <br />them would die. Not any of them were the <br />slightest bit funny. It's about like having <br />sex with a woman that just lays there and <br />doesn't even have any good emotion. That's <br />what the rest of the cast was. <br /> <br />I can't help but think had this been done <br />sorta like Scary Movie it might have made <br />more funny. Nothing againest Brits, but I <br />even misunderstood alot of the jokes be- <br />cause of the accents the guys in the movie <br />had and that ruins the experience. <br /> <br />The movie had chances to be funny and it <br />totally missed the mark. The gore was good <br />and the acting was decent when you consider <br />what type of movie this is and some of the <br />zombies looked cool... It's ashame the lead <br />two guys had such mediocre jokes to work <br />with and such a bad supporting cast. <br /> <br />This is worthy of rental, but don't be a <br />fool and buy this like I did. <br /> <br />btw, You anti British people really are tools.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Lost and Desperate Housewives got all the hype last season. They were supposed to be the pendulum swing away from Reality programming and back to quality hour long scripted drama. But the outstanding freshman drama of 2004-2005 was Veronica Mars.  <br /> <br />Desperate Housewives descended into soap opera. Lost failed to deliver a plot to go along with its pretty and talented cast. Veronica Mars on UPN, on the other hand, proceeded to show the big boy networks how it is done.  <br /> <br />Veronica Mars is a well scripted,  phenomenally acted show that rewarded its viewers with a complete story arc that answered all questions posed in the pilot.  <br /> <br />The cast is mostly young unknowns who proved their talent and ability to engage the audience with an engrossing storyline. The show is smart, funny, tragic, romantic and film noir all rolled into one pleasing confection. <br />  <br />The incredibly talented Kristen Bell (Showtime's Reefer Madness) stars as Veronica Mars. She is a high school student who has lost everything. Her rich boyfriend broke up with her with no explanation. Her best friend was murdered. Veronica's  sheriff father lost his job in the ensuing investigation, while Veronica lost her social status as a result. Her mother abandoned the family. Veronica was drugged and raped.  <br /> <br />In order to make ends meet her father becomes a private investigator and Veronica works in his office after school  All this is laid out in the pilot.  <br /> <br />Kristen makes you believe this character with every frame in which she appears.  <br /> <br />Rob Thomas, a former teacher and creator of the too quickly cancelled Cupid, is the mind behind Veronica Mars. He knows today's high school students and presents them in a fairly matter of fact fashion.  <br /> <br />Kids drink. They do stupid things. There are consequences. And they are cruel to outsiders and Veronica is an outsider. Just not as much as she likes to think. She manages to make quite afew friends along the way, solving cases for fellow students who need her help, as well as helping her dad with his cases.  <br /> <br />Unlike the claustrophobic sets of many high school shows where characters rarely interact with anyone outside the main cast except for the MOTW plot, classmates you meet in early episodes here actually reappear in later episodes and even with limited screen time their stories seem as rich as the main characters stories.  <br /> <br />Veronica is not perfect or always right. She does not give self-righteous speeches. She is all about Old Testament 'eye for an eye\\" vengeance. She is complicated. <br /> <br />She has a loving relationship with her father. A sweetly supportive platonic best friend Wallace. Weevil is the leader of the local motorcyle gang as well as Veronica's muscle when she needs a favor. Duncan is the ex-boyfriend with secrets to hide. And Logan, played by the excellent Jason Dohring, is the snarky rich kid that makes her heart beat faster even when she hates herself for it.  <br /> <br />Veronica, in short, is a self admitted \\"trainwreck\\". And watching her sort out the mysteries in her life while sorting out her place in Neptune high school is a pure pleasure.  <br /> <br />Thankfully the DVD's will be out in October. Unfortunately the second season of Veronica Mars starts Wednesdays on UPN in September. Try to catch the show in reruns to be up to speed for the second season of this wonderful show!  <br /> <br />
B00062ZE3U|5.0|For a \\"Silent Force\\", it sure does pack one hell of a punch. I think this CD is amazing in several ways... Reading over some of the reviews, some accuse Within Temptation of becoming mainstream, or compare Sharon den Adel to Evanescene's Amy Lee. Wrong. Metal can't be mainstream, unless you're Metallica, or System of a Down. People will disagree with me on this, but I only feel this way due to the exposure of the band. As for American exposure? None that I know of... But I just wanted to clear up that Amy Lee is NOT Sharon den Adel, and will never be anywhere close. Within Temptation is NOT Evanescence. It's like comparing Nightwish to Evanescence... Not even of the same genre, therefore comparing is pointless. Anyway, my rating is as follows...<br /><br />1. Intro - 5/5 - Just a brief entry into the CD. Instrumental flutterings that head into a sort of choral sound, not sure if it's just vocalizing, or if they're actually singing something. Then, Sharon den Adel, with her fantastic and non-Amy Lee voice (because her register is much higher), vocalizes for a bit, then transitions into the next track.<br /><br />2. See Who I Am - 6/5 - This is a very strong track. Starting heavy, heads into a mellow verse with the angelic voice. Then, the bridge becomes heavy, and the chorus becomes heavier, with a very distinct heavy balance. Repeat to end.<br /><br />3. Jillian (I'd Give My Heart) - 6/5 - The song starts out slow, which kind of bothers me, because it takes 30 seconds to reach it's point. However, when it finally hits, you know the wait is worth it. The chorus is my favorite part of the song. There are ever-present \\"Ah-ah\\"'s in the background, and I think that adds a little something. With Sharon den Adel's high register, this song is well worth it.<br /><br />4. Stand My Ground - 6/5 - This is where I can see that someone would accuse Within Temptation of becoming mainstream. This song could have very easily became popular in the US (similar to Evanescence's \\"Bring Me To Life\\") because it's not extremely heavy, and not too slow. But considering the genre (whatever it may be), I don't see much happening with them in the US, yet. But this is a very good song.<br /><br />5. Pale - 4/5 - This is a very slow song. It's still a good song (if you pay attention to the lyrics). Her voice soars in the chorus, she lets you know she can belt it out. Some decent drum sounds in the song into the second verse. A slow song with powerful vocals, as always.<br /><br />6. Forsaken - 5/5 - I didn't like this song much at first, it had to grow on me. I liked the guitars, and the heaviness, but her voice just didn't seem to work with the melody for some reason. But repetitive listening of the awesome CD made me think otherwise. Similar background vocals that were in \\"Jillian (I'd Give My Heart)\\" were also present in this song, it really clings well to the music. Towards the end of the song, it seems like it's going to end, but it picks back up and takes the song to the end the right way. (Right meaning how it SHOULD be done) :-)<br /><br />7. Angels - 4/5 - This song is definitely one of those misleading types. It starts out nice, angelic (as the title implies), and the takes a 180 degree turn into a completely different angle. I call it an anger song, because the words seem to be something someone would say to an ex. I don't want to ruin the surprise for any of you, you should just buy the CD and listen.<br /><br />8. Memories - 4/5 - This is the first song on the CD that I heard. I thought, \\"Hey, this sounds kind of like the old Within Temptation stuff...\\" (old meaning \\"Mother Earth\\" etc.) But then I heard the rest of the album and realized they were far from the same. They have changed, and I feel for the better. This song is very slow at first, but moves into a more upbeat pace, but leaves the same thought. Not my favorite, but still a sweet song.<br /><br />9. Aquarius - 7/5 - This song was my first love on the album. I can't really describewhy... But whatever they did in this song just blows me away. It's probably the chorus... or mostway through the song when she vocalizes into a heavier, higher octave chorus in preparations for the finale of the song. I don't know an Aquarius... But then again, I assume she's talking about some kind of water god... Not the zodiac sign (due to the words of the song).<br /><br />10. It's The Fear - 3/5 - I don't really like this song. The string of words in the song that I do like, however, are, \\"...Because my fate, is horror and doom...\\" Even so, I don't think the words fit this particular song... When she says, \\"horror and doom\\" ... The music surrounding her does not suggest that. It's probably just my picky taste.<br /><br />11. Somewhere - 3/5 - This is the only other song on the CD I don't really like. It's slow, which is ok, and the words actually match the music in this one... I don't know, like \\"It's The Fear\\", it just never grew on me.<br /><br />12. A Dangerous Mind - 10/5 - In my opinion, this is the best track on the album. Everything's amazing... The intro, the verses, the chorus, the lyrics. It's just a masterpiece. I don't know what else to say about it really... The only word I can think of is, \\"Perfect\\". \\"I just have to know... While I still have time... Do I have to run? Or hide?! Away... From you?!?!\\"<br /><br />13. Swan Song - 6/5 - Swan song? Better not be. Beautiful song, no complaints... Nothing to really describe... Just another great song.<br /><br />This force is far from silent. Maybe Within Temptation planned it like that. I hope this helps anyone, and that it clears up the Within Temptation/Evanescence confusion.t really describe why... But whatever they did in this song just blows me away.

B00005JMAH|4.0|If youre like me, youre pretty careful what you spend your money one, researching what people have said, what the price is, whether or not youve seen it, read it, or heard about it.  You add it all up.  I do that with everything and usually Im not disappointed.  The DVD of the FRIENDS season was a sure hit, as was the novel THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD and my magazine subscriptions to PEOPLE and SPORTS ILLUSTRATED.  So, as usual, I was right on the target with HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER. <br />In HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN, Harry Potter and his friends Ron and Hermione return as teenagers to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry for their third year of study, where they delve into the mystery surrounding an escaped prisoner who poses a dangerous threat to the young wizard. <br />&quot;We couldn't be more excited about Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban being in the hands of such a relentlessly imaginative director as Alfonso Cuarn and are thrilled about the new actors he has assembled to join our already established cast,&quot; said David Heyman. <br />&quot;To be entrusted with such rich and beloved material, and given the opportunity to collaborate with this extraordinary cast and crew on the next Harry Potter adventure is an honor,&quot; Alfonso Cuarn said. &quot;I look forward to bringing this intricate story to the screen and sharing it with film audiences around the world.&quot; <br />&quot;I'm so proud to have been involved in this truly amazing film series, both as a director and a producer,&quot; added Chris Columbus. &quot;I look forward to seeing it grow as Alfonso and the cast and crew further our imaginations with their truly inspired work.&quot; <br />Gary Oldman plays Sirius Black, the eponymous prisoner whose escape is thought to pose a great threat to Harry Potter; Michael Gambon plays the role of Professor Dumbledore, Hogwarts' venerable headmaster; Timothy Spall portrays Peter Pettigrew, an old friend of Harry'sfather, James Potter, from their days at Hogwarts; David Thewlis plays Professor Lupin, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor who harbors a mysterious secret; Pam Ferris plays Harry's overbearing Aunt Marge; and Paul Whitehouse portrays Sir Caddogan, a Knight who becomes the temporary guardian of Gryffindor Tower.
B00003CXC6|5.0|One of the timeless classics offering a profound insight into the nature of human beings and the stories we tell.  How we see things, the filters we place on our view of the world, say more about us than the \\"truth\\" of the events we \\"witness\\".  This film is a masterpiece - a must see not only for film lovers but for anyone looking to art as a reflection of human realities.
0316168815|4.0|I bought this book because of buzz surrounding the story. It is a story of girl who is dead and watches her family deal with her horrific death. I have passed this book on to friends and some can not get pass first few chapters and then others just love it. Be prepared to deal with some horrific images and maybe some peace about death.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I don't think anything I say here will add or subtract from the success of this CD by Coldplay.  But I will say it anyway.  I read critics here unhappy that they don't sound the same as they did on the first CD's, and some think all the songs sound the same.  It doesn't matter, X&Y is what it is...a great CD!  One to remember to Summer of 2005!
0446607274|5.0|Published in 1998/99, this is Connelly's sixth Harry Bosch story; by now he has twice that many novels, not all in the Bosch set.  \\"Flight\\" is another fine entry starring the intellectual, somewhat reclusive LAPD homicide detective, although in this one Bosch is still married to (gambling addict) Eleanor, the cause of much anxiety as a sub-plot to this tough yarn.  Things get rolling when Bosch is called out late at night -- out of turn and out of territory -- when a black lawyer specializing in suing the LAPD turns up dead on an inclined railway just days before a high profile case against the cops goes to court.  Various police brass and Internal Affairs are at the scene, and all are worried about another round of Rodney King-type riots.  As the teams pursue various issues, the complex plot shifts from one suspect to another, most of whom are fellow men in blue; but Bosch doggedly chases all the clues despite the chiefs wanting this one over and done fast, with Bosch's ex-pard Sheehan on a platter as the bad guy.  The role of a pedophile web site and a young girl's wealthy parents add dark tension to matters as well.  In several twists near the incredibly suspenseful ending, the blame shifts back and forth among perps as fast as one can keep the pages turning!  And the final ironic dispensation of justice is just that.<br /><br />We've read enough of Connelly's work now to rate him very highly in this genre.  He crafts terrific, complicated, and intriguing plots that are difficult to scope out till quite near the very end.  While his leading men and ladies are hardly perfect, we soon care about them; we feel their pain and frustration with not only the quirks of the case at hand, but even just the same life stuff with which we readers have to contend!  His fan base only grows side by side with his booklist.  Enjoy!
B00005JNSK|4.0|Tim Burton has done it again! When the film concluded, little children with their chocolate-smudged faces had nothing to do but stand up and cheer. No kidding. They actually cheered. Parents were satisfied that they didn't drop eight bucks on a chocolatey mess and everyone else, fans of the old movie and the book alike, enjoyed it as well. What's not to enjoy? Johnny Depp is amazing as Willy Wonka, with his broad grin and pearly teeth, displaying indifference toward the five children lucky enough to tour his factory and utter joy at his wonderfully delicious candy. Willy Wonka believes that he knows what is important in life-- candy candy candy. But he couldn't be more wrong. <br /> <br />Unless you've been living under a rock, you should know the story. Willy Wonka, inventor of dozens of candy concoctions, puts five Golden Tickets into the wrappers of his candy and sends them to different corners of the world. The tickets eventually land in the hands of the fat chocolate addict Augustus Gloop, spoiled brat Veruca Salt, gum chewing maniac Violet Beauregard, the violent video gamer Mike Teevee, and of course, the hero of the story, the sweet, innocent, and ordinary boy Charlie Bucket. You will love Freddie Highmore as Bucket. He's so perfect, so adorable, and little Charlie knows exactly what the most important thing in life is-- family family family.  <br /> <br />So instead of bogging this review down with more plot points that you should probably already know, I'll just skip to what makes this such a great film. Tim Burton! He set out to make a version that was more like the book. Well he succeeded plus some! This is not at all a re-make of that fluffy 70s movie. The style, the sound, the characters are all wonderfully different. There's more SUBSTANCE, especially with Wonka's character. And the only singing comes from the Oompa Loompas. Thank God. His style, from the design of the candy room to the crookedness of Charlie's house, is more what I had in mind when Iread the book. One of the toughest things for me to overcome while watching this movie was the Oompa Loompas. Forget the orange faces and green hair. Yes, it's hard to do because the image is stamped on all our brains, but you have to in order to see this movie. <br /> <br />Great movie. Would see it again. Very sweet and, well, sensitive. Sends out a positive message to kids and will hopefully keep some away from greediness and video games... at least for a while. Definitely check it out. Johnny Depp's performance is soooooooo worth it. <br /> <br />
B00009P1O2|5.0|I own both this disc and the \\"On Fire at the Bowl\\" DVD. This is by far my favorite. Everything is done right and to perfection here. There is a majesty in the filming and editing that is missing in the other performance. Maybe it's the energy of this awesome Wembley crowd. Shot just before sunset, the transition to night time is magical and Freddie commands! He is loved by and connected to the crowd like very few performers. The sound is stellar, Brian is in great form, the harmonies are spot on, it is incredible to realize this wall of great sound is coming mostly from a trio. Of the 28 songs on this DVD there are only 8 that are on the \\"On Fire..\\" disc, making this practically a whole different show. I prefer the selections on this Wembley performance and although some reviewers claim the performance on the \\"On Fire..\\" disc was better, I do not agree. The combination of song selection, multi camera filming, sound quality, and a second disc of extras make this the preferred choice for me. An absolute must have for ANY fan of classic rock.

0060556501|5.0|The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis is coming out in the movies in December and I can't wait! If you haven't read this to your kids yet, you'll want to do so before it comes to town.<br /><br />I have been listening to the audio tapes with my granddaughter as we drive around town but I wanted to read her a book version also. Unfortunately, I don't have that much time to read the whole book, so I went to the bookstore and found a picture book version (retold by Hiawyn Oram) that just came out. It's only 40 pages long and is just enough to give her a taste of the real book. Hopefully, I will get to read the real book to her someday. In the meantime, this one is wonderful. The pictures are georgeous! And it tells enough of the story to wet your appetite for more.<br /><br />If you're like me and just have enough time to read a short version or if you have younger children who are able to sit through the real book yet, I recommend this book. Otherwise, go for the real thing
B00006RU5B|2.0|No, not every supergroup fails. Look at Fugazi. And as far as grunge bands go, look at Mad Season, although they were not perfect. Many other bands as well were decent enough. Sometimes making two great sounds can make a bombastic album. However, Audioslave manage to be something that neither Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden ever were: Bland corporate rock. These songs are not all dreadful, but you get the feeling after awhile that all of these songs are too similar and while it's really good the first time, you eventually realize that these songs are all by-the-numbers. The musicianship of each member is just as good as it was before but with Audioslave you get underwhelming results. <br /> <br />Except for the exceptional \\"Shadow on the Sun\\", there isn't really anything worthy of note as far as good songs go. Some of those were already singles. I guess I was expecting a lot more from them. In spite of this corporate rock sound I actually do have respect for Audioslave. I just can't get why I can never get into them, as I have honestly tried. <br /> <br />For a better supergroup album, try the one from Velvet Revolver. For albums of the artists, try Soundgarden's 'Badmotorfinger' and 'Superunknown' (then complete from there) and Rage's self-titled and 'Battle of Los Angeles' albums. I honestly haven't heard their new album but I think I'm not shelling any money out on that unless it's used or strongly discounted.
B0009OPO0S|5.0|It seems that Shakira was in an isolated, and emotionally challenging period when she composed many of these songs. Rich, deep and enigmatic are the words that I feel drive this album. The contrasting styles of reggae, pop, techno, rock and rag time is what makes this album such a delight to listen to, the flexibility and extensive capacity of the human voice utilised across  many musical genre is what I adore most. Dia Enero with its delicate melody, subtly rhythm and empassioned lyrics give a direct insight into personal human love where as Escondite Inglese, with its funky melody, enticing modulations - circus like influence- and  variety of vocal technicality present a quirky and fun rock/ pop insight into insecurity in love. I just want to add here, that it is the depth and variety of Shakiras voice along with the precision of melody and rhythm that evokes such a sensuality across the album.
B00005JNSK|4.0|The first third of this movie, where you meet poor little Charlie Bucket and his family in their dilipidated home, where they are so poor that his grandparents sleep in one bed by the fire, head to toe, is so nearly perfect and straight from the novel by Roald Dahl that I actually got tense as Charlie would open each candy bar and still not find that golden ticket. The disgusting children around the world finding those tickets were spot-on as well, including the best update whatsover in the movie, where Mike Teavee, who in the book dresses as a cowboy and shoots his toy gun at the TV screen, is translated into an expert videogamer playing a Quake-like game while being interviewed.<br /><br />Of course, perfection when it comes to translating a movie from book to screen is something rarely achieved, and I should be grateful for even that first third. Because as soon as Willy Wonka greets the children, the flaw in this movie becomes all-too-readily apparent: Tim Burton repeats the mistake he made in the first Batman film by putting a famous actor in the lead role who doesn't so much play the role as he plays himself playing the role. In Batman, it was Jack Nicholson who couldn't see the movie because of his own greasepaint; here, it's Johnny Depp, who looks the part, but plays it with more ticks than Big Ben. Sometimes, as in Nicholson's Joker, it's funny--but the problem is that it is distracting from the story, and the story should be king.<br /><br />After his introduction, and we start the actual tour of the factory where the children show their true colors, we get back to the story, but every once and awhile Burton highlights Wonka again, with the addition of flashbacks to Wonka's own childhood that are not from the book and were totally unnecessary to the plot.<br /><br />On the plus side, Burton uses Dahl's lyrics for the songs that the Oompa Loompas sing about the bad children. Unfortunately, the songs are so overproduced in both sound (a typically Danny Elfman-type error with movie music--it was fine when he was in a rock band, but in a movie, you only get once chance to hear the lyrics and having the music overwhelm them defeats the purpose of having lyrics) and visuals (the Oompa Loompas are one man, digitally reproduced, and in the dance numbers this becomes so apparant that instead of enjoying the visuals, you are distracted by noticing the filmmaking).<br /><br />All in all, I liked the movie, for when Burton gets it right, such as when the squirrels decide the Veruca Salt is a very bad nut, it captures the book perfectly. I'm just saddened that Burton (or the studio?) felt that they had to insert differences from the book. Danny deVito's Matilda remains the best adaptation of Dahl from book to screen, and that's because he didn't waver from the book, in large part due to his children threatening him that doing so would make them very, very mad. I guess Burton didn't have that type of editor.Elfman-type error with movie music--it was fine when he was in a rock band, but in a movie, you only get once chance to hear the lyrics and having the music overwhelm them defeats the purpose of having lyrics) and visuals (the Oompa Loompas are one man, digitally reproduced, and in the dance numbers this becomes so apparant that instead of enjoying the visuals, you are distracted by noticing the filmmaking). <br /> <br />All in all, I liked the movie, for when Burton gets it right, such as when the squirrels decide the Veruca Salt is a very bad nut, it captures the book perfectly.

B000002N2P|5.0|Get your Green Day facts straight, people! <br /> <br />To all the ignorant (and uninitiated) Green Day fans here (and there seem to be many): Be careful when you say \\"Have a green day\\", because you're inviting someone to go out with you and get blitzed off pot for the entire day. So, if you say that to someone, be sure to have a stash to share. The term \\"Green Day\\" was (and still is) Bay Area slang for laying around all day and doing nothing but smoking pot. Billie and Mike were so fond of weed that they changed their name from Sweet Children to Green Day as an ode to their love of the reefer. <br /> <br />Anyway... <br />In 1987, the band released a four-song Sweet Children EP on Skene Records. At this point, they weren't known as Green Day yet. The first EP the band released under the name of \\"Green Day\\" was 1,000 Hours (which came out in late 1988). The 39/Smooth EP came out in 1990 (months apart from the Slappy EP). 39/Smooth was not a f*cking LP.  As stated by a previous reviewer, Kerplunk WAS in fact Green Day's first LP (long-playing record). Unlike later CD pressings, the original vinyl LP does not contain the Sweet Children bonus tracks from the '87 EP.  <br /> <br />LPs are full-length albums, while EPs are shorter, and contain less than a full album.  <br /> <br />Okay, I'm out of breath.
B00006JJ1O|5.0|The debut album by t.A.T.u. is a very unique album. It cannot be branded into any one genre of music, and it is certainly a far cry from today's mainstream music disaster. This album describes the relationships of two teenage girls in love. This may seem controversial to many people, but the thought-provoking lyrics and instense music really help shape them into a unique and different band. Some songs, such as Not Gonna Get Us, All The Things She said, and Clowns, have pounding beats and meaningful lyrics. Others such as 30 Minutes and Stars show you the more mellower side of t.A.T.u. Every song describes different things young lesbians must go through. Thoughts of running away to be together (Not Gonna Get Us, All The Things She Said), being accepted by other people for who they are (How Soon Is Now?, Clowns), or showing love to one another (Show Me Love, Stars) are all common themes in this album. The only song that does not bare a lesbian image is Malchik Gay, and it still has a theme dealing with homosexuality. Malchik Gay translates into \\"Gay Boy\\" and it talks about a girl falling for a gay boy. If I had to classify this album into a genre, i would call it dancepop. For those of you who think t.A.T.u. have faded into oblivion, don't worry, their english sophomore release, \\"Dangerous and Moving\\", will be released in America October 18th and their russian sophomore release, \\"Lyudi-Invalidi (Invalid People)\\" will be released October 17th. Their first single off of that album, \\"All About Us\\" will hit radios September 1st. I reccommend buying this album. You will not be disappointed.

0142004235|5.0|This is probably my favorite book.  I couldn't put it down!  There were several stories going on at one time, but it wasn't confusing...it was like following a saga of two different families.  Very intriguing!

B000777J2S|5.0|I deeply enjoyed the first album but it had a number of catchy tracks (Hitler in my Heart, The Rapture, Blue Angel) that pulled me in. As previous reviews have mentioned, \\"I am a Bird Now\\" takes a turn to the low-key, but the album more than surpasses his first effort. A skeleton of song and voice, this album is powerful, disturbing and incredibly overwhelming. One listen will not suffice, give it some time, you'll fall in love.
B0002FR07O|5.0|I bought the Signify album a couple years ago and loved it.  Just recently I was in the store and noticed that the reissue was packaged with an entire second album of demo and unreleased material!  That was enough incentive for me to buy this double album, and I was glad I did! <br /> <br />If you have never heard Signify in the first place, I can only say that it is a fantastic album and you won't regret buying it.  If you need more convincing, just look at the reviews for the original Signify album, I don't want to get into that here. <br /> <br />This album is a remastered version of the original.  To be honest the album didn't especially need a remaster.  This version does sound a bit cleaner and has a stronger bass sound, but I haven't compared the two side by side and I don't notice any major differences.   <br /> <br />The real prize here is the second disc, an album called \\"Insignificance\\" that was only available through the PT information service back in 97.  Although it's comprised of b-sides and demos, \\"Insignificance\\" is a better album than most bands would record at all, and a real treat for die hard PT fans who didn't get to hear it the first time around. <br /> <br />\\"Wake as Gun I\\" is just a solid PT song in the vein of the other non-instrumental tracks on Signify, perhaps not as unique as the ones that made the album but still a great track. <br /> <br />\\"Hallogallo\\" features the same tune as the opening of the track \\"Signify,\\" but it is played without the distortion and the feel of the song is much softer. <br /> <br />\\"Signify\\" is close to the album version, but isn't quite as aggressive and actually has some vocals towards the end!   <br /> <br />\\"Waiting\\" is the same as the album version, except not as developed as far as the background and electronics of the track, and the lead and other guitar fills are arranged differently.  Hearing this formative version really makes you appreciate the beautiful phrasing of the guitar leads in the final version. <br /> <br />\\"Smiling not Smiling\\" is another song like \\"Wake as Gun\\" that didn't make the album, but is definitely a good inclusion on this one. <br /> <br />\\"Wake as Gun II\\" begins basically the same as \\"Wake as Gun I\\" but disintegrates into ambience and guitar noise.  Interesting track. <br /> <br />\\"Neural Rust\\" is a very cool instrumental track, but much more upbeat sounding than \\"Signify\\".  Keen PT fans will expect this to be an early version of \\"Every Home is Wired,\\" but in fact the songs have no relation.  I nterestingly enough the opening drumbeat is the same one used to open \\"Dark Matter\\". <br /> <br />\\"Dark Origins\\" is exactly what it sounds like it would be.  The song starts with the beginning of \\"Dark Matter\\" and then continues with that basic pattern and expands it into a great instrumental track, I guess in the same manner that \\"Waiting phase two\\" took the bassline from \\"Waiting\\" and expanded on it.   <br /> <br />\\"Sever Tomorrow\\" is basically the same as \\"Sever,\\" but I think the revised title was a good choice. <br /> <br />\\"Nine Cats- acoustic version\\" is exactly that, an acoustic version of the \\"On the Sunday of Life\\" classic.   <br /> <br />If you never had Signify, this is a great time to pick it up.  IF you already know how great the album is...what are you waiting for?  This is more than worth the purchase.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This past Christmas, a friend with a bit of foresight gave me this recording, telling me that I couldn't be a \\"true theater kid\\" until I listened to it. Being at the time more into Blink-182 than Norbert Leo Butz, I doubted her words, but, upon listening to this album... and then Rent... and Avenue Q... and The Last Five Years, and so on, I can say that Wicked is without a doubt one of the best musicals I know of, due majorly to its cast members but also the music itself's quality. <br /> <br />If you're looking for subtlety, Wicked is not for you. But if you want overblown, soaring, bombastic SHOW TUNES, then buy it right now. There's a reason that a musical is currently in Amazon's top 20 sellers, and that is its pop sensibility, which makes the musical a true standout. <br /> <br />Looking at specific songs, there are the obvious standouts. My personal favorite, the hopeful and exuberant \\"The Wizard and I,\\" the sweet, if unoriginal, \\"As Long As You're Mine,\\" and of course the simply astonishing Act I finale, the indescribable \\"Defying Gravity.\\" Whenever I feel like slamming doors, jumping up and down on my bed and screaming along with a \\"who needs you anyway?\\" song, I always head straight for \\"Defying Gravity.\\"  <br /> <br />And so it is an obvious conclusion to reach that the star of the show is the incomparable Idina Menzel. Surrounded by a cast of amazing talent, she still makes herself stand out. Costar Kristen Chenoweth is operatic, utterly convincing, and devestatingly hilarious, and Norbert Leo Butz as the love interest is used to great, if not enough, effect, in \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and the aforementioned \\"As Long As You're Mine.\\" But Menzel's powerful and unique voice destroys all competition for the spotlight. Her husky pipes turn what would be a good recording into a stellar one. Built on the solid foundation of a plot, which is wholly unlike Gregory Maguire's also excellent book of the same name, the songs are allowed to soar into the stratosphere in a musical that redefines BIG. A must-buy, in my opinion, if only because of Ms. Menzel's amazing talent.
B00095MLGC|5.0|I discovered PT on their \\"In Absentia\\" tour with Opeth and they have since become probably my favorite band and I have bought everything I could find from Steve Wilson.  If you have heard any PT material then you will understand why I could have told you months ago that this was a fantastic album, even though I didn't hear it until now.  Many have discovered this great band from their last two albums (finally some recognition) and it is amazing to see that even on PT's first \\"proper\\" full length they were recording masterpieces.  Al the good things you have heard about this band are absolutely true, and if you are only familiar with their new material I will say that this is quite different but equally good, as long as you don't mind the fact that most of the songs are instrumental jams and there aren't that many lyrics.  I just can't comprehend how Steve Wilson writes stuff like this, it's brilliant. <br /> <br />\\"Staircase Infinities\\" is also included as the second disc and it's great as well!  Now I can only hope for a reissue of \\"Stupid Dream\\" and \\"Recordings\\"!  You won't regret buying this or any Porcupine Tree album.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Being a huge Coldplay fan, I was very excited for X&Y, and songs like the lead-off single, \\"Speed of Sound,\\" as well as probably the next-best-known song on the album, \\"Fix You,\\" do not disappoint. Coldplay is bigger than ever, both in popularity and scope of their music, and everything just feels bigger. On the aforementioned songs, as well as on some others, like \\"Little White Shadows\\" and the album opener, \\"Square One,\\" this works very well, and represents Coldplay on a par with its previous album, A Rush of Blood to the Head, which ranks in my top five favorite albums of all time. <br /> <br />However, despite these highlights, it cannot be said that this album is as good as Chris Martin and crew's prior efforts, for the simple reason that highlights do not a great album make. ARoBttH was a GREAT album. When I listen to it, I'm never satisfied unless I hear the whole thing, and never skip a single song. X&Y reaches the same highs (well, not quite \\"The Scientist\\" highs, but then, that's expecting a bit much), but tempers it with a few lows. I won't mention any specific songs, because I honestly forget which songs I've just been listening to after playing the less-enjoyable (in my opinion) second half of the album. But there are a few that I just don't feel are worth the effort to get through when I can just play the first half over and over again and enjoy it much more. <br /> <br />Fans who were expecting Coldplay to surpass their Everest of a musical peak will be disappointed, but those of us with more realistic hopes will be very satisfied with this effort. Considering the habit that musicians have of following up genius work with pure trash, Coldplay has done much to earn our confidence. X&Y may not be as fantastic as past Coldplay, but there are several more songs that must be added to any \\"Coldplay's Greatest Hits\\" playlist, and overall a very, very good, if not great, album is what Coldplay are happy to provide us with.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This album was pretty awesome the first time I listened to it, but it really grew on me the more I listened to it. I love the album, but it is still my least favorite of their first 6 albums with Ozzy. True it is their last great album, but I actually like Technical Ecstasy. It's a fun album. Sabotage on the other hand is an awesome album, just slightly under the likes of Black Sabbath, Paranoid, Master of Reality, Volume 4 and Sabbath Bloody Sabbath.<br /><br />It starts off with the pretty good opener \\"Hole In the Sky\\". Not one of their best opening songs, but I still really like it. Then it's suddenly, out of no where, interrupted by an awesome, very short instrumental...<br /><br />\\"Don't Start(Too Late)\\". It's very short which is a shame because it's awesome, in that it's really simple, but perfect.<br /><br />Then right after that, like that on Master of Realitys \\"Ebryo\\" going into \\"Children of the Grave\\", Sabotages \\"Don't Start(Too Late)\\" leads into the most fast paced kick butt song of the album, \\"Symptom of the Universe\\"!! Which has an awesome middle section to it, but leads right back into madness!<br /><br />\\"Megalomania\\" is a 10 minute epic full of great riffs and vocals. At first listen I wasn't big on this song, but after a while I loved it.<br /><br />\\"Thrill Of It All\\" is a pretty awesome song with a really cool riff you would easily expect from Black Sabbath. Great Tune!<br /><br />Then comes the short epic wonder \\"Supertzar\\" which I don't know for sure how to pronounce, but that's ok I love it anyways. It's nice, dark and the choir is a nice creepy touch. It has a very epic sound to it, but IMO epics are usually longer songs ranging over 10 minutes. Gorgeous instrumental!<br /><br />\\"The Writ\\" is a great song as well with some of Ozzys very best vocals and a very beautiful middle section to the song! I might consider this to be my favorite songs on the whole album.<br /><br />At first I didn't care for \\"Am I Going Insane(Radio)\\", but I like it, because it's creepy and campy!<br /><br />Black Sabbath fans should own this one already! It's a keeper and it rock! I don't consider it their best by any means, but it is still very much worth getting.but I like it, because it's creepy and campy! <br /> <br />Black Sabbath fans should own this one already!

0385510454|1.0|If the manuscript of this novel had arrived at an editor's desk bearing an author's name of \\"John Smith\\" rather than John Grisham, it would have been rejected out of hand for publication as boring, unfocused, half-hearted, and lacking in suspense.        This is a turkey of a thriller. The plot is that Joel Backman, a former Washington wheeler-dealer, is pardoned from prison at the behest of the CIA so that he can be murdered by whichever assassins hate him most: Israelis, Chinese, or Saudis.  The CIA stashes Backman away in Bologna, Italy and waits for said assassins to find him, but Backman -- guess what? -- manages to escape and lead them all on a merry chase.  Whoopee!     The barest of plots is covered up by descriptions of fabulous Italian architecture, scintillating Italian coffee, sumptuous Italian food, elegant Italian fashions, intriguing Italian women, and endless lessons in how to speak Italian.  Methinks Grisham has a serious infatuation with Italy... and can hardly wait to show us his color slides and souvenirs.      Unless you're really desperate I wouldn't read this, but if you're really desperate you can skip over page after page without missing anything, including a climax that fizzles like overaged spumante.

B000002U9W|5.0|Atom Heart Mother is very obscure. It contains one of the coolest songs ever to be recorded also called \\"Atom Heart Mother\\". It's the first track on the album. It's over 23 minutes and if you're into long epic songs then this is one song you will not want to miss. It's all instrumental, but also contains a choir. It's one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs, since I love long epic psychedelic pieces of music.<br /><br />\\"If\\" is a beautiful song that I really love. Nothing on this album is on their greatest hits package, only beacause I think the band is ashamed of the album. I don't see why though, since they were being different and trying out new things. I tend to like the more obscure stuff of any band. \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"If\\" would be on my best of Floyd any day!<br /><br />\\"Summer of 68\\" is a really good song. Quite the nice tune that starts off nicely then gets quite loud and in your face in a nice way, not a heavy way.<br /><br />\\"Fat Old Sun\\" is just plane gorgeous.<br /><br />\\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\" is long, obscure, weird, nice, trippy, anyways...I like it, but sometimes stop it while I'm listening to it. It's hard to listen to sometimes. I love weird songs, but the guy eating gets annoying. It has some great piano though.<br /><br />You should try playing \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" (The song) to the last 23 minutes of 2001:ASO, it's really cool! It also works with the song \\"Echoes\\", both being the same length and all. The scene where you start it at has something to do with Jupiter. The name Jupiter is in the title.<br /><br />Anyways I love this album. It is one of their more obscure ones. I love it mostly for the first 2 tracks. The first song alone takes up half of the album!
B00004XMV6|4.0|I have owned this movie for more than 3 years and still enjoy watching it. I looked through most of the other reviews and couldn't believe it was the same movie that I have seen. I like Mickey Rourke - he has a quality about him that is incredibly sexy. Kim Basinger is good in this movie. Her hair is a bit messy, but a small detail. Elizabeth (Basinger) is dumb in some parts, she lets John (Rourke) have total, well almost, total control of her life and how she does thinks and dresses. In one scene, when he is feeding her she looks like someone that should be in a hospital. She looked sick. Because it is from the '80s the hair and clothes are a bit too much, but hey that is what was in at the time the movie was made. I enjoyed the sex scenes. I especially like the one in the alley after they fight off 2 guys (one that she stabs in the butt with a knife). I am not sure if it believable having sex while climbing up and down stairs, but I suppose anything is possible. I guess that after thinking about it I wouldn't mind going through 9 1/2 weeks, but I would have to change a few things about it. Hands down I would want Mickey Rourke, probably leave out the prostitute/XXX theater thing, but the rest of it I think I could handle. If you haven't seen it do it now. It isn't a masterpiece, but it is fun to watch.
B000020617|5.0|You would'nt think the Foo Fighters could of topped their last two albums, but they did, or at least they made one just as good. Every track on this album is just great, and each song, rather than sounding like a raw three minuter, like on their debut, sound refined but edgy. <br /> <br />Its one of the best albums you could own, as well as their first two. After this they just went to commercial, for the musics own good.
0060977493|5.0|Arundati Roy presents a great read that explores the many issues revolving around post-colonial India. It holds a hint of sarcasm surrounded by immense sadness. It brings you to a level of feeling where you fell unhappy but can't express it. Through Ammu, Roy explores the position of women in South Asia that fall off the marraige boat. Ammu's dislocation in society, how she is often pitied but never helped. Her love for an untouchable. It's all very touching and expressful. If you're bored of all the this happened first and that happened second, you should definitely read this book. My favorite personal favorite was how Ammu often feared her son's turning into another \\"male chauvinistic pig\\". but it is very depressing, so ignore it if you're already in the blues.
6305535264|2.0|With hysterical dialogue like that, is it any wonder why this movie failed? Yet it has some redeeming values. <br /> <br />Those of you coming of age in the late 70's, early 80's like myself may remember this flick as one of many sci-fi thrillers emerging from the shadows of STAR WARS. I couldn't see SATURN 3 at the time because it was rated \\"R,\\" but I remained intrigued. <br /> <br /> <br />After finally watching it, I will agree SATURN 3 belongs in the \\"Cult Cheesy Sci-Fi\\" drawer. I could easily see this as late night viewing when nothing else is on the other 800 satellite channels. This is a movie that does not challenge the mind but instead puts it in suspended animation. With enough plot holes to fly fake spaceships through, it is best to sink into your favorite easy chair, pop open the Doritos and turn your brain off when watching SATURN 3. <br /> <br />The incredible aspect of SATURN 3 is not the \\"amazing\\" special effects (of which there are none), but the talented filmmakers and actors associated with its production, all of which could not save this movie from being as bad as it is.   <br /> <br />***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*** <br /> <br />No less than the venerable Stanley Donan (SINGIN' IN THE RAIN, CHARADE) is credited as director, and his direction here looks likes he's terribly out of his element. Elmer Bernstein's soundtrack is atrocious: cartoonish and more suited for a carnival funhouse. The screenplay by noted writer Martin Amis comes across like a college freshman thesis project. Why does Harvey Keitel want to go to Saturn 3 so badly, and what is his purpose in manufacturing this eight foot homicidal robot? Don't think too hard; these and many more questions will drive you mad if pondered. <br /> <br /> <br />Kirk Douglas is not bad as the aging scientist who gets to lay pipe with a nubile Farrah Fawcett (although I did not need to see his old flabby ass in one particular scene. Farrah's would have been much better). He spouts ridiculous dialogue created by the aforementioned Mr. Amis through clenched teeth, yet makes it all seem somewhat believeable. <br /> <br /> <br />Harvey Keitel at first seems wooden, robotic, in his delivery and acting, and it becomes clear that it is exactly how his character is: cold, efficient, bureaucratic. Although he speaks his lines in a steady monotone and an unblinking glare, this is a foreshadowing of him later literally becoming a machine. <br /> <br /> <br />Alas, Farrah Fawcett is by far one of the worst actors I've seen. She comes across as a life-size Betty Boop doll, clearly chosen as eye candy, her helium-filled delivery distracting and comical. Her much vaunted nude scenes are seconds long and unfulfilling, and as I've pointed out earlier, we see more of Kirk Douglas' craggy butt than hers. <br /> <br /> <br />The robot, Hector, is actually very interesting. I like how his body is composed of tubes of liquid, much like blood vessels. His body is monstrous and tank-like. His puny head atop this huge structure ruins the look and reminded me of the shrunken-headed guy in the Limbo waiting room from BEETLEJUICE.  <br /> <br /> <br />I remember reading an article about SATURN 3 in FANGORIA magazine when I was a kid, and I recall stills from this movie which depicted some gory scenes. In actuality, there is very little gore or blood, except for a guy at the beginning splattering like a watermelon, and Harvey Keitel having his very fake looking hand dismembered by Hector. Perhaps the gory scenes were edited out. Since the rest of the movie is so terribly edited, these scenes should have remained, and at least we would have had some good gross-outs to compensate for the rest of the dreadful film. <br /> <br /> <br />I did like the production design, which at least tried to make the sets look futuristic, despite the late 70's kitsch. The not-so-special effects are antiquated and cheesy by today's standards (and probably by late 70's standards), with lots of smoke and dry ice to simulate rocket propulsion and cardboard cut-out spaceships against a star-filled black screen. <br /> <br /> <br />One nifty feature (and since stolen by THE MATRIX) is the rear \\"port\\" in the back of Keitel's head from which he can \\"download\\" information and insert into Hector. Even the design of the \\"port\\" itself seems to have been lifted directly from this movie by the Wachowski Brothers. <br /> <br />Overall, an interesting but failed vintage sci-fi thriller that can be watched on a lazy Sunday afternoon or late at night when the brain waves are less active. Worth at least a rental. The DVD transfer is actually pretty decent, but it has no features other than a scene selection menu.
B00005UEAR|5.0|The fact that this album elevates Dream Theater to the same league as Beethoven or Morzart may sound like exaggeration, but it is quite true ....Six Degrees of Inner turbulenece makes bands like Iron Maiden , Judas Priest , Metallica sound amatuerish in comparision.  Indeed ,I would not be going too far in saying that \\"Master of Puppets\\" is a just set of glorified nursery rhymes ... yes , that is just how good this album is. <br />The Glass Prison is probably the best song the band has ever produced , with the possible exception of the 42 minuite long title song. <br />Blind Faith ... another surprising piece of work . The keyboard bit in the middle sends you to heaven. <br />Nothing need be said about the rest of the tracks ....I'd be simply wasting time praising this album to the skies ... words  are insufficient to explain the genius of this album. <br />The bottomline is , if you are an enthusiast of music , this album is a must-have.
B000002LIX|4.0|This was a classic that can never be duplicated. I go back to 1991 when I hear tracks off this album and it gives me goose-bumps. I used to cover the song Three Days in an old band. I prefer the album \\"Nothing's Shocking\\" as a personal favorite but \\"Ritual...\\" is a must-have to your collection as well. I was one of the many deeply saddened by the disbanding of Jane's. Most people are aware of Porno for Pyros (Farrell and Perkins) but Dave Navarro and Eric Avery put out and album entitled \\"Deconstruction\\" that is unbelievable. Eric A. also had a project called \\"Polar Bear\\". Jane's Addiction was one of the best band's of all time.
B000A88F22|5.0|I think we all know by now that the \\"reality shows\\" out there are more show than they are reality. They have producers, writers, and tv execs controlling what we see. Are the Osbournes really that crazy? Is Jessica Simpson really that dumb? Probably not, but they know that what people want to see.<br /><br />The reason I loved \\"Chaotic\\" so much was that it was so raw and real. It was just two people using their personal video camera to get to know each other. Everything that was said and done came from them. There were no writers or reshoots to make something more interesting. I applaud and respect both Britney and Kevin for showing that side of themselves. Not many people are that open and willing to expose themselves that way. I was already a fan of Britney's, but after watching \\"Chaotic\\" I became a big fan of Britney and Kevin.
B00001MXXH|5.0|\\"Oh, I'm sorry. I can't come to the door right now. I'm afraid that in my weakened condition, I could take a bad spill down the stairs and subject myself to further school absences. You can reach my parents at their places of business. Thank you for stopping by. I appreciate your concern for my well-being. Have a nice day!\\" <br /> <br />How funny is that? How was it possible for a 17-year old slacker and his two friends to get out of class and back in one day? That's the whole thing about this funny 80s movie. <br /> <br />However, despite my 5-star rating, there isn't much to do on this DVD - I know it's an old release, but the audio commentary being the only bonus feature and not even a trailer on there? Well, at least Paramount has better DVDs now! <br /> <br />BTW, a couple more things: <br /> <br />1. If Ferris says he doesn't plan on being European, then why does he have a Union Jack in his room? I have one in my room, yet I plan on being European! (Because I care about education more than him, I guess?) <br /> <br />2. Why does Ferris always complain about not having a car when he has all of his cool stuff - a computer, a keyboard that plays puking noises, and a big, expensive entertainment system - in his room?
B0006A9FKA|4.0|As has been noted, SHAUN OF THE DEAD ( R Rated version) is a parody. It works well because it just satirises the genre in detail. Shaun is in every scene except one, and he is the driving force behind this film in terms of characters( His commentary work, he appears on both tracks) is nothing short of great, and as one of the co-writers he basically knows what he wants.  Crafted in a way that only a few British writers can do, the symmetry, and the irony, works well, in fact extremly well in a british context, but may not translate 100%  .... see the deleted scenes, other bits, and hear the main commentary for details on what happened there.  So much thought went into the writing alone of this film, that the commentary does not do it justice; especially things like \\"FOREE ELECTRONICS\\" where Shaun works, and the scene  where Dylan \\"Dies\\", all  have echoes, or are dead ripoffs of George Romero's work( And Very Specifically of the genius of Tom Savini's groundbreaking makeup work), as well as the general makeup work in DAWN OF THE DEAD ( Original  Romero version)[ and a very nice reference to \\"Budd\\" the Zombie ].    This film is a blast, and to top it all off, the extras are total gems, and appear to have fans in mind. Great Value in all respects, and a top notch B Grade film.
B00000I07P|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums to come out of the 80's.Truly a masterpiece and was an awsome concert! Thanks guys!
6305922756|5.0|One word..Classic. Not only will you laugh your a*# off, but the music isn't bad at all! If you can get past lyrics like \\"working on a sex farm....\\" and \\"Big Bottom, talk about mud flaps, my girl's got 'em\\". And the actors play their own instruments!This music has classic lines(anyone remember \\"Hello Cleveland\\"?, and you'll bust a gut counting how many drummers the tap has gone through, and how their music venues somehow get smaller and smaller! Seriously, these guys are genius! And for extra fun and uniqueness, the commentary is done in character, and apparently the band members aren't too happy with Marty! I promise you, buy this dvd, any serious collector must have \\"Tap\\" in their collection!
B000001FP8|4.0|I thought this was a great album also and was a great concert.Good follow up to Slippery When Wet.

Like having 4 bosses \\"remind\\" you about a tiny mistake that doesn't really matter, the doggone fax machine that is your sworn enemy, and of course the office FREAK, who you know is gonna someday show up to the work place armed! This movie has it all, and it's hilarious! So, if you ever get a case of the \\"mondays\\", call in sick,blow off those dang TPS reports, and watch this movie!

B000929AJQ|5.0|If you've heard \\"The hand that feeds\\" the first single from this album well, it would be pretty easy to rate this album off as a sell out album for Nine Inch Nails, but they are to clever for that - or at least Trent Reznor is. <br /> <br />Don't expect something mind blowing musically such as  <br />\\"The Fragile\\" or expect something like \\"The Downward Spiral\\", in its own way this album is a retread musically from the more complex sound of NIN and has a more straight forward appraoch to the songs. <br />Its a great album, and it looks like Trent Reznor is already planning for a another NIN album next year. <br />Thank goodness its not another 5 years.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Or rather, the revitalizing of one. Batman has always been my favorite superhero, mostly for his lack of super-extraordinary powers and the darkness of his image. Unlike the all-American apple-pie wholesomeness of Peter Parker and Clark Kent and their respective counterparts, Bruce Wayne and his alter ego were always far more sinister. Menacing. Sombre. Unfortunately, the previous film renderings - even Tim Burton's much-beloved forays into the franchise - lacked this sense of dark inscrutability, ranging anywhere from the insanely Gothic to the unbearably campy, but always missing the true essence of the character. <br /> <br />Not any more. Christopher Nolan brings new life to the Caped Crusader, along with a more in-depth psychology and more believable methodology than anything seen previously. I cannot think of anyone I'd prefer as Batman than Christian Bale: he has a single-mindedness, a certain ferocity to him, that absolutely works for the driven character of Batman. He is in prime form here, demonstrating his usual dedication to the character and impressive talent, but he has got quite a supporting cast to back him up. <br /> <br />Not since the Lord of the Rings movies has such an extraordinary ensemble of performers been assembled in one film. These people are artists first, before movie stars, and it shows in their careful craft. The performers are not the only great aspect of the film, but they are essential to the mood: always realistic, they are nefarious or idealistic when appropriate. My particular favourites are Liam Neeson, elegant and paternal as always, but here driven by darker motivations than usual, and Michael Caine, who brings a humanity and emotional realism to Alfred that has not been seen before. He too is a father figure to Bruce, a nice touch that has been lacking from his usual function as a crusty facilitator. Also wonderful is Gary Oldman, who does a 180 from his usual slightly insane roles and embodies so much decent normalcy onscreen that it is slightly disconcerting in the midst of such madness. Indeed, the only weak spot in the casting is Katie Holmes as the dewy Rachel Dawes: she is amiable enough, but sorely outclassed in an otherwise exceptionally outstanding ensemble. <br /> <br />The production design is also outstanding. Gotham City is rotten to the core, to be sure, but there are observable vestiges of the grandeur that was, and also of the Wayne family ties to the city: Wayne Tower dominates the city centre, and the Wayne monorail - the pet project of Bruce's philanthropist father - is a now-dilapidated relic of better days. Its destruction near the end of the film is almost poetic. Batman's technology is not as advanced, but this I see as an improvement rather than not. The Batmobile, for instance, resembles an unlovely cross between a Lamborghini and a Hummer - far tougher and less sleek than the others, but practical for the demands of city-saving. I particularly like how it gets in and out of the Batcave. No fancy lifts or hydraulics here; it shoots - with a little help from its jet engine - through a waterfall into the Batcave, which is precisely that: a dark, dank, craggy mess home to some tens of thousands of bats. The Batsuit is something that looks like it might actually be an extant but neglected military prototype. And, perhaps most happily, it is presented sans the molded nipples and thong underwear, and even the \\"six-pack\\" is not ludicrous. The evolution of it, particularly the Cowl, is also entertaining to watch. All this combines to give this Batman a far more realistic tone, something the franchise has long needed. <br /> <br />But now let us return to Bruce Wayne for a moment. This is by far Christian Bale's most commercial film to date (ignoring 2002's largely forgettable \\"Reign of Fire\\"), but the actor gives no sign that he is a bona fide Hunky Movie Star in a bona fide Big-Budget Summer Blockbuster, giving another finely-tuned, pitch-perfect performance. His Bruce Wayne is subtle, nuanced, tormented not only by the demons of his childhood but those of his own dark soul. He is extensively trained but not entirely grounded; there are hints of madness in his dark eyes. Bale is debonair and suave, yes; he is completely believable and appropriately shallow in his playboy persona. <br /> <br />But more than this, he is scary. One would not want to meet him in a dark alleyway, nor would one want to get on his bad side. He inspires fear, not only as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne too; this is something the previous Batmans failed to do for me. Bale has always had an enormous talent for using his physicality to enhance his characters: in \\"Empire of the Sun\\" he went from a skipping, easy-going slip of a lad to a hard-bitten, almost feral survivor; in \\"American Psycho,\\" he was a ripped, six-pack-bearing, body-obssessed narcissist; in \\"The Machinist\\" he transformed into a walking skeleton, haunted nearly to his own extinction by his inner demons. Here, he is brawny, equipped again with a finely muscled physique that looks quite capable of beating the life out of someone. It is more than eye-candy here (although I'll gladly admit I'm happy to see him buff and beautiful again after his cadaverous turn in \\"The Machinist\\"): it makes the persona of the superhero believable when we know there is under the molded latex of the Batsuit a real, honed, physical weapon that could inflict definite and serious damage. <br /> <br />One is impressed, too, in this film that Bruce's alter-ego Batman is more than a way to shoot off steam after the playboy's partying. Unlike Peter Parker, who strives to live a normal life despite his superhero responsibilities as Spider-Man, Bruce Wayne needs Batman: the two are symbiotic halves of the same whole, neither equalling a whole person and neither capable of existing without the other. Bale captures Bruce's essential humanness without ever overplaying the role, bringing gravitas and dignity to the superhero genre.<br /> <br />This is definitely a Batman of the twenty-first century, informed by terrorism and 9/11. Rather than outlandish corporate villains and hedonistic monstrosities, the enemies here are idealists, warriors who fight for ideas rather than power. Ra's al Ghoul and his inscrutable League of Shadows operate covertly, infiltrating hierarchies, quietly sabotaging social structures, utilizing economic warfare. Here, they employ a biotoxin emptied into the water supply as a weapon; it is not to destroy the world, but to save it from itself. This allows for a far greater exploration of human motivation and psychology than has been attempted previously, and is far scarier than anything else I've seen in \\"hero\\" films. The film has received some criticism for not playing up to the younger, more comic-book atmosphere of the others, but this is precisely one of its biggest strengths. It is a very grown-up superhero flick, with adult concerns and adult methods on display. This Batman is part film noir and part action flick, but the two are married gracefully, bringing a long-overdue elegance to the franchise and offering the promise of several more fine outings to come.
B00006LIRI|1.0|Problems?  <br />*Uneccesary remixes of \\"Zooporopa\\" and \\"Pop\\" tunes, quite oviously to tone down the actual musical aspect here and make it fit in with the rubbishy U2 commercial 2000 era sound that is so mainstream accesible. <br /> <br />*Numerous and vital tracks that made U2 so relevant and important musically in the 90s!! This album totally missed the whole point! <br /> <br />How it should of gone. <br /> <br />1. Even Better Than The Real Thing <br />2. Mysterious Ways <br />3. The Fly (missed out!) <br />4. One <br />5. Until the end of the world <br /> <br />6. Lemon (missed out!) <br />7. Stay (faraway so close) <br />8. Numb (commerialised eg. remixed) <br /> <br />9. Discotheque (commerialised eg. remixed) <br />10. Staring at the sun (commerialised eg. remixed) <br />11. If god would send his angels (missed out!) <br />12. Please (missed out!) <br />13. Last night on earth (missed out!) <br />(dare \\"Mofo\\" make an attempt to fit in on this album??) <br /> <br />14. Kite (not on the album) <br />15. When I look at the world (not on the album) <br />16. Walk On (not on the album) <br /> <br />17. Electrical Storm (could of sounded alot better than it did) <br />18. The ground beneath her feet (another vital song that many would of liked had it got the exposure) <br /> <br />So many artists are forgetting music is about \\"actual music\\" not how many an album sells, or how popular it is. <br />Heak U2 are in pop culture territory music wise now in 2005 <br />(or nearly, not quite thank goodness), and the rest of the music scene is as fake as it has ever been, sad ): <br />

B00005JNBQ|3.0|This movie has definitely developed a cult following. My friends recommended that I see it when it was released in theaters, but I never got around to it. They described it as \\"an awkward movie about awkward people being awkward.\\" Basically, I didn't really get it. I kind of understand how other people could think it was the Funniest Movie of All Time, but I'm not one of those people. This movie is by far more fun to quote than it is to watch. It's hilarious out-of-context, but not worth sitting down for an hour and a half to watch. When my dad saw it, he said it was like watching your kids in the school play: cute, but not really entertaining. And I would have to agree. It's funny, but not hilarious. It's good for about 20 minutes, not 90.
B0009KA7BS|4.0|I had seen commercials for the movie Constantine on Tv ad they looked interesting so I rented the movie from my local Blockbuster. Overall I would say the movie was interesting and entertaining. I thought the scenes of Hell looked pretty cool along with those hell-creatures. I also like the gun that Constatine uses. I have never read the comics that this book is based on so I can't really judge the movie on them but I still don't understand why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. It kept me entertained and that is what I want most from a movie even if it isn't 100% loyal to the book or comica that it was based on.
B00007KWHO|4.0|I was just telling my boss about this record today! To be honest with you, the first two Yes albums are better than the more bombastic and commercially-successful records which follow. The original band focused on short, intricately-arranged, pieces. Yes started out thinking \\"How beautiful and interesting a statement can we make?\\" and ended up thinking \\"How can we impress the audience with our musical cleverness?\\" These two records are often compared to the Beatles, but I think they also show the influence of \\"Odessey and Oracle\\"-era Zombies.
006016848X|2.0|I read this when it first came out, mostly because the title was just too delicious to resist. I also liked the prospect of deepening understanding and \\"resentments melting away\\" that the book's cover promised. But when I read it, I found myself more and more resentful with each passing page. It took the laudable promise of bridging the gap and ended up strengthening what I thought were the worst stereotypes about the sexes.  Certainly men and women think and communicate differently, and that is something we absolutely need to remember when we deal with one another. But what those differences actually are do not follow simple little patterns that John Gray wants us to believe. He makes a few valid observations and extrapolates the rest, making stuff up to fill in the blanks.     Gray essentially recommends that you reduce human beings to oversimplified stereotypes and  use these as shortcuts to understanding them. He tells you to condescend to them as a group instead of recognizing them as individuals. What's worse, he tells you specifically not to recognize them as fellow creatures at all.       I do think that he does a decent job --AT TIMES-- of explaining some male behavior that baffles women (I have spoken to men who confirm that some of the explanations were accurate). But he really misses the boat when it comes to women. For example, according to him, it's NORMAL for women to get unbearably depressed on a regular basis and cry our eyes out for no reason and that men should just accept it! But I suppose it was well intentioned!
B00005JNSK|4.0|This movie is great! But who could expectless than perfection <br />from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp? Some scenes might be a little too scary for young children, but overall this movie is a sweet treat for the whole family.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|I am a huge Mariah Carey Fan, I have all Her CD's including this one...After Listening to about 15 times now.  I Never got tired of her voice and the Lyrics.   <br /> <br />The Emancipation Of Mimi really takes me back to my first CD I bought (Daydream) how i can't stop listneing to her and how those vocals just make me feel so calm and forget the stress of the day.  Her voice and lyrics in Emancipation of Mimi really do reminisce on her beginning years (like the first 3 albums).
B0000C0FJB|5.0|A lot of people have complained about the mixing of this CD, and since Rush has always had high quality control standards, I can offer only this thought. <br /> <br />I've never - never - heard a crowd this energized for anyone.  I'm not sure they made this much noise for the Beatles at Shea in 1965.  Listening to this is almost like looking down on the band from the lawn seats, in terms of what I hear, and the crowd noise excites me as much as anything the band does here.  Maybe that influenced the band's decision not to emphasize their parts unnaturally in the mix, and anyway, I have had no problem making out the instrumentalists or what they're doing - particularly Lee, who gets the most clarity and warmth he's ever had on a live album without the benefit of a soundcheck.  Sometimes Geddy's voice and the crowd's tie for volume, but he's effortless and in pitch throughout. <br /> <br />Download Real if you don't have it, and listen to the samples here for a good idea of whether or not their mixing will bother you.  To me, several songs are given what sound like definitive renditions [\\"Big Money,\\" \\"Dreamline,\\" \\"Red Sector A\\"...and even if it's not the clearest recording ever, it's fun to hear Rio drown out Geddy on \\"Tom Sawyer\\"] and it would be a mistake to ignore the obvious exchange of energy and emotion between the band and the audience just because the audience hasn't been muted through the song and jacked artificially for the segues.  Casual fans of Rush might do without, but anyone who enjoys hearing Rush live will love this.
B000003TAW|5.0|Weezer began their career with a bang in 1994 with their self titled debut record. Their fun power pop style has made them a favorite to many people. They seem to get constant play every time they release a new single. So what made these nerdy guys so likable in the first place? It all started with this album. This was actually their biggest selling album to date and is considered a favorite among hardcore Weezer fans. I suppose the hit singles \\"Buddy Holly\\" and \\"Undone\\" didn't hurt either.     We kick off the record with the catchy, and imaginative \\"My Name Is Jonas\\",  which starts off with a nice acoustic riff into power chords and later in the song breaks off into some nice drumming and guitar work. It ends with the same acoustic riff it opened up with.  The next track \\"No One Else\\", singer Rivers Cuomo's lyrics sound demanding yet sung rather sarcastically. I like the short guitar parts that happen toward the middle of the songs. There are quite a few standout tracks on this album. \\"Buddy Holly\\" is defiantly one of note. The sheer catchiness of the song is undeniable. Next we come to \\"Undone\\" which is a dreary song with a catchy chorus. It's slow intro is outdone by the powerful chorus. The lyrics could mean a number of things. The sweater could be a dying relationship, loosing dignity, among other things.     The album is full of carefree moments such as \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Surf Wax America\\". Other tracks worth noting are \\"Say It Aint So\\" which Rivers confronts his feelings about how he dealt with his father's alcoholism.  \\"In The Garage\\" is one of my personal favorites about escaping to the place where you can do what you please without any problems. I can see this actually being written in a garage where the band practiced before actually making it big.  The album ends with the lonely \\"Only In Dreams\\" which is the longest song on the album. It dies down for a while before going into a long solo. It's pretty awesome. It provides a fitting end to a classic album. (41/2 Stars)
B0006399FS|1.0|This album is garbage period. I read a review of someone saying that this is U2's best album. is that a joke or what? I would recommend you Skipping this overrated garbage and buy their only 2 good albums. The Joshua Tree and achtung baby.
B00005JNSK|5.0|this evening i connected with a lot of people. it was not at a meeting of any sort, but at a movie. Movies bring people together. In one movie, people can laugh together, cry together, or gasp together, making a connection if only for a couple hours. Tonight the audience and I mostly laughed together while watching Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I would recommend it to anyone. It has a little bit of everything for any person (except for those of you who only like the movies that include blood, guts and horror). I had heard that Charlie was being listed as a horror movie...one can only guess by the \\"scary\\" previews and the way that Johnny Depp's character is portrayed. All in all, the famous critics did not give this movie a great review, but most of the time i find that if they like a movie, i do not and vice versa. everyone should go and see it, you will laugh and have a smile plastered on your face the whole time.
6304698623|5.0|Nicely done adaptation of the Frances Hodgson Burnett story.  Okay, I know this iteration strays from the book but it IS a MOVIE and a very entertaining one at that.  The story moves along nicely with a great sound track and a beautiful verdant color theme.  The part of Sara is played wonderfully by Liesel Matthews.  This is truly a perfect family film for every family member.
B000002TQV|4.0|Radiohead are one of the most versatile bands you will ever hear and extremely talented at that. From 1993's grungy \\"Pablo Honey\\" to later, more electronically driven albums like \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac,\\" it cannot be doubted that Radiohead have some serious talent. But \\"The Bends\\" is certainly an album that has great musical validity and is the beginning of a journey of exploration for one of the most diverse bands ever to be formed...<br /><br />This album is almost purely an acoustic offering, but has touches of electric guitar and electronic samples that would later become the cornerstone of Radiohead's unique sound. In true Radiohead spirit, this album is beautifully sad, but also expertly executed. Thom's voice is wonderfully clear and really comes through on this album. The guitars are loud enough to be appreciated but do not overpower Thom's vocal performance. The drums are crisp and solid, with the electronics being more \\"carefully\\" blended in this album rather than more experimental work of later albums.<br /><br />\\"Fake Plastic Trees,\\" is a terribly sad song but really touches your soul, and is perfect for easy listening at the end of a long, hard day. \\"My Iron Lung,\\" deviates from the acoustic theme but purely adds to the flavour and experience of this wonderful collection. This song is also a forestaste of later, more liberal experimental work that Radiohead would carry out later on in their career. Perhaps \\"The Bends,\\" could be considered to be the perfect introduction to Radiohead as a whole since the album is not really \\"radical\\" as such, and really shows Radiohead beginning to move into different sectors in their music.<br /><br />To reveal more about this album would most likely ruin it for you. So I invite you to experience Radiohead first hand. Heck, borrow it, buy it, steal it, just give it a listen.

If you don't enjoy experimental and acoustic work, then I suggest you look elsewhere; but personally I believe this album is pure, solid gold...work, then I suggest you look elsewhere; but personally I believe this album is pure, solid gold...
B000A6CLL0|4.0|i have read what many have written about the death of \\"enterprise\\" however i think they miss the mark, but by just a little. what doomed \\"enterprise\\" was not the acting, or directing, or writing of any one episode. in fact i think one can make the valid point that the overall acting and directing, and the writting of many episodes in all 4 seasons was as good as anything in the trek canon. <br />     what undermined the show fron the beginning was the \\"bible\\" <br />on which the show was based. i do not mean that a show that covered the beginning of the federation was a bad idea, just that the way it was done was totally screwed up fron the beginning. the basic idea the relationship between vulcans and <br />humans is more like that between overbaring parents and teenagers who thing they are allready adults. according the the \\"bible\\" the vulcans have spent the 88 years from \\"first contact\\" to the building of the nx-01 impeadind whenever possible, the ability of humans to get beyond the sol system. <br />humans have been denied such things as warp technology, information on the verious political relationships beyond the sol system ( such as relations between vulcan & andor, the very fact that there is a klingon empire - let alone it's size and power, ect, ect, ect...)and even such simple things as a up to date star chart, as well as being limited to what other races humans do come into contact with. because of this commercially operated space freighters have more experience, and their pilots have more flying time than mid 22nd century starfleet. <br />     because of all of this the first 2 seasons of \\"enterprise\\" <br />bumbled, fumbled, and stumbled around the galaxy trying to explore without knowing the rules, while at the same time trying to avoid screwing up so badly as to warrent being called home and proving the vulcan high command correct. and having a first officer throught to have been placed on board to spy on the crew grew boring after a while. in additionthe temoral cold war sub plot was never understandable, because you never did learn who was fighting who and why.   <br />     by the time season two was coming down to its last few episodes, the show had crashed and burned, 75% of the viewership was gone (forever as it turned out) and the network, upn had switched the demographics, it wanted to go after ( let's face it, the type of viewer who would tune in week after week to find out at the end of the season which contestent will end up with the chance to be the next trya banks, most likely does not watch good drama on t.v., let alone good scifi, let alone star trek ) but after realizing their screw up, rick berman & co. decided the the \\"bible\\" was a failure and that if the show was going to be saved, some changed needed right away.  <br />    season three was that change, and by the end of the season the show was finally on track, but running out of time. the idea of a season long story arc was a gamble, which in my opinion worked quite well. the only error in the story arc that i see was the maintaining the temoral cold war sub plot. this season laid the basis for season 4, which forfilled all the  <br />hopes of the loyal viewers.  <br />     as for the future, i fear that the release of \\"enterprise\\" <br />will be the last new trek we will on either the small or big screen for a long time. paramount, as part of viacom, is going through some major changes at this time. and by the time things settle out, the new management may buy into the \\"conventional wisdom\\" that star trek has shot it's wad, that the star trek fan base are nothing but a bunch of over the hill nerds and geeks, and the path laid down by gene roddenberry is as out of date as the hayes code, god/gods/the phophets/the great bird of the galaxy help us all  <br />
0156027321|4.0|Like C. McCallister (review on July 14, 2005), I find Life of Pi difficult to review. I agree that Martel writes exteremely well.  But contrary to McCallister I found the book easy to read after the first couple of chapters. Indeed, it was downright difficult to lay down when I was in its midst.  In fact, this to me is strictly the result of Martel's excellent writing skills: well-developed characters, easy-flowing prose, articulately described settings and character passions.    My problem with the book laid in its storytelling and content. I felt the whole point of the book was telegraphed by the telling. The unbelieveability of the behavior of the characters were at the core my issue. Hence, I found myself deciphering Martel's intentional puzzle from the get go. It was that simple. So for me there was no fear, no shock, and hence no underlying plot that threaded the story from start to finish. Nothing but Martel's excellent sentence-to-sentence and paragraph-to-paragraph writing carried me through from chapter to chapter.     Another measure of a book for me is how I am personally affected by it. In this case, I felt like I had done the reader's equivalent of eating a marshmallow. It was delectible in the reading, but what was the point?
B00003CXPJ|1.0|This movie is just amazingly stupid, which is sad because there were so many great stars in it.  Stay away from it.  There is not a single funny line in the movie.  Really. This movie smells.
1400032717|5.0|When I picked this up, I was in an airport looking for something that I hoped would entertain me during the two-hour filght. I am not a believer in reading best sellers; for me, they rarely make for good reads. But in a pinch, I pick them up on occasion and sometimes friends hand me dog-eared copies while extolling praises. In ths case, I grabbed a book that turned my head. Narrated by a 15-year old with autism, it was easily written. This makes the book's depth especially astounding. That is, the narrator's age and malady lend him an innocence that makes him apparently unaware of the various subplots that are obvious to the reader. This makes the book a masterpiece of sorts. That is, I cannot imagine that Haddon did not acheive all that he set to do in the context of this novel.  <br /> <br />I am not saying that this book deserves a Pullizer or that Mark Haddon should get a Nobel Prize. But there is something in The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time that everyone can enjoy. In fact, I believe that this book could become a Middle School and High School reading favorite. The upbeat tone and outlook of the book (yet narrated by an underpriviledged person) would make an excellent addition to the usual unfortunate conditions yielded in most of the significant reads extolled in schools today.  <br /> <br />The bottom line is that this book was a great treat. I hope other authors learn that you don't need to write in as lengthy and complex a style as John Steinbeck, Wallace Stegner, D. H. Lawrence, James Joyce, E. L. Doctorow, or Edward Jones in order to write a clever and enjoyable book. I cannot imagine, however, how Mark Haddon can top this one. Nonetheless, I will surely read his second novel.
076781326X|5.0|I saw this musical when I was just a kid - about 25 years ago now - and I have NEVER forgotten its' story line, or the great musical numbers it displayed.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is probably one of the last great musicals ever produced (although I also loved Annie!) - and, I must say that I honestly wish musicals had never gone \\"out of style\\", I miss their great scores, voices & dances.<br /><br />\\"Oliver!\\" is about a young orphan who is forced to take to the streets in order to find food & drink.  He's befriended by a pick-pocketer who attempts to show Oliver the ropes - but of course he's just using this young, impressionable boy.  But, even so, this master pick-pocketer is lovable (in his own way).<br /><br />Will Oliver ever find a family who loves him?  One who he loves as well?  These questions will be answered masterfully in the movie.<br /><br />This is one of those great movies that can be enjoyed by the whole family!  Soon both the kids & adults will be singing along to the great tunes!<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys musicals - or even those who don't know what a musical is. Who knows, it may become one of your favorites too...
B00005JKC3|3.0|this film was essentially unwatchable; however, it's worth fast-forwarding through just to see the most successful creation of a realistic, computer-generated human (or humanlike) character to date. the anatomical detail was remarkably well-defined, and although the movement was occasionally puppetlike, it was much less so than in other films such as spiderman. most impressive of all was the facial animation, which far surpassed the work in lord of the rings. the expressions were subtle and natural-looking; only a few contortions of rage seemed a bit artificial and unconvincing.  <br />I'm always mystified as to why these film versions change the most interesting elements of their cartoon sources. the hulk is perhaps most famous for his absurd, bewildered monologues, where he refers to himself in the third person a la tarzan. why make him mute? wouldn't it be irresistably fun just to mess around in a sound studio to come up with a voice for him? it makes me want to whack the director on the head with a rolled up comic book.
B00005JKOI|5.0|I have just pre-ordered this DVD, so I am reviewing the contents of the movie that I saw about 20 years ago (and have seen about 30 times on late night t.v. since then) - I'll review how well the DVD was done once I get it.  But, I just couldn't resist adding this to my Listmania list of \\"my favorite movies\\"!!!<br /><br />I experienced my \\"teen years\\" during the mid 1980's, so of course I saw EVERY ONE of the Molly Ringwald movies when they came out - and I LOVED every single one!!!<br /><br />I often wonder what ever became of her - as she had quite a string of hit movies, and then just disappeared from the radar.  I honestly hope to see her again some day, as I always thought she was a really good actress...<br /><br />Anyway, \\"Pretty in Pink\\" is about a teenage girl living during the 1980's (you can tell by the \\"great\\" style of clothes) on the \\"wrong side of the tracks\\".  She lived with her father, who simply did not like to work, as her mother had left them some years earlier.<br /><br />She spends most of her time with her best friend \\"Ducky\\" - who's a really great guy, also from a \\"working class\\" family.  However, there are 2 REALLY rich, good looking guys who seem to be interested in her.  1 of them is a MAJOR jerk, and all he ever cares about is \\"one thing\\" (I'm sure you know what I mean), so she consistently turns him down - which makes him EXTREMELY \\"pissed off\\".  The 2nd guy seems to be a pretty nice guy, and she becomes enamored of him.<br /><br />Well, the \\"nice guy\\" finally asks her out & she says yes - only to be treated like trash by his friends.  But, they try to continue dating & he eventually asks her to the prom - & she says yes.<br /><br />Will he show up?  Will she be forced to go alone?  Who will she end up with - Ducky or the rich guy???  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you never saw the movie, but suffice it to say that you will ALWAYS remember the ending to this movie!!! (I don't know of anyone who doesn't, and many of them last saw it about 20 years ago!!!).<br /><br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage romance movies in general, or the Molly Ringwald gang in particular.  This is a great movie, and much of it will still make sense to today's teens.  In fact, if you grew up in the 80's, your kids might be around that age now, so you could watch it together - a family movie night...hem last saw it about 20 years ago!!!). <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage romance movies in general, or the Molly Ringwald gang in particular.

B00005JNSK|5.0|im tired of people saying this is a remake of a movie, it is simply Tim Burtons creative interpretation of Roal Dahl's Story and Tim Burton Does it best. Johnny Depp is amazing and completley original, i havn't seen such unusual and phenomenal acting as portrayed by Johnny in this movie. Its hilarious, a feast for the eyes, and its just an overal fantastic movie.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|This is another one of those GREAT Molly Ringwald movies from the 1980's - the ones that show EXACTLY what highschool life was like for us some 20 years ago.<br /><br />\\"The Breakfast Club\\" is about 5 highschool teens who were forced to attend in-school suspension on a Saturday (could you imagine having to be in school on a weekend???  Do they do that anymore???).<br /><br />Anyway, these 5 teens were from COMPLETELY different circles and, although they had seen eachother in the halls, and had heard rumors about eachother, none of them REALLY knew what the others were about.  So, they start off thinking that each one is totally different from them, and so they are each pretty snobby to the others.<br /><br />There's 1 \\"tough guy\\", 1 \\"geek\\", 1 \\"jock\\", 1 \\"glamour girl\\", and 1 \\"weird/loner chick\\".  Due to the fact that they all HATED the teacher who was watching over them, they wound up coming together to go against him.  It's during this process that they come to learn about eachother's home & school life - they learn about eachothers hurts, thoughts & fears.  And, through this, they realize that they're not so different after all.<br /><br />So, will they continue to be friends after this day of in-school suspension is over?  I don't want to ruin it for you in case you've never seen it, but suffice it to say that you'll probably never forget the ending to \\"The Breakfast Club\\" - I don't know of anyone who has - even 20 years later...<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys teenage-type movies - it makes as much sense today as it did 20 years ago (only the styles have changed).  I would also recommend it to anyone who was a teen during the 1980's - it will bring up a lot of great (or not-so-great) memories of your highschool years.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|I will never buy a CD that uses this copyright system again. I just want to put the CD on on IPod. But no, it's not that simple. I have wasted hours trying to get the music on to my IPod with no success. <br /> <br />I heard that David Grohl said that we were lucky that we only had to pay the price for one CD. At the same time he admited that their last CD sucked. <br /> <br />Well if I can't use the CD I purchased, the way I want, the price will never matter!! I will never buy another CD that uses this copyright system.
B000002HRE|4.0|I don't understand why some people dislike Load but quite like Reload. Having owned reload before I owned load, I think Load has some stronger songs on it overall, and less 'filler' than Reload. Note that the songs on Load/REload were all recorded at the same time for the most part. Metallica put what they thought were the 'best' songs on Load, you can be sure of that. Personally I agree with them; there's a lot of quality on reload but its not as good as Load. <br /> <br />I'm not going to bother to excuse Reload from the 80's Metallica stuff. Read my review of Load if you want to know WHY these albums can still be 'good', even in the face of Metallica's incredible 1980's work. Most people that don't like Load/Reload are people who ONLY like heavy music. THere's a lot of good songs on these cds if you only give it a try with an open mind. Be advised though, it did require a few listens for me to get used to this style of Metallica. Sure; classic cds shouldn't require several listens to 'like'. I agree; but this isn't a classic album. This is just an album that you may spend money on, and you may as well see if you can get into it and enjoy what you can about it. <br /> <br />Anyway, there are some outstanding songs on this album. THere's the opener fuel, a nice faster rocker with some good riffs. The Memory Remains is a weird song, with Marianne Faithful doing what my friends and I refer to as 'the grandma bit' at the end of the song. It's weird, but a fun song and not hard to like <br /> <br />Devil's Dance is a pretty good song; it has some interesting guitar effects. Unforgiven II is an excellent song; some may complain 'ehh, songs can't have sequels'. But why not? It isn't the same song remixed or anything, I don't see the problem. Its a good song in its own right. <br /> <br />Better than You is the first average song on this cd. It's not bad, but I find it a bit monotonous and it doesn't 'grab me'. Slither is much the same, I don't find the melody very attractive <br /> <br />Carpe Diem Baby, a weird title (yes I know what it means) but a pretty good song. Bad Seed has some cool riffs in it but I don't think much of the singing. <br /> <br />Where the Wild Things Are is a good track, very strange music but enjoyable nonetheless. Prince Charming is quite average and I can't find much to say about it <br /> <br />Low Man's Lyric is a wonderful song. BE warned, its quite an unusual MEtallica song; there's a 'hurdy gurdy', (i.e. a kind of keyboard/synth) and its a clean (i.e. not distorted guitar) song. But the subject matter is very touching and James sings is honestly. <br /> <br />Attitude is another average rocker <br /> <br />Fixxer IMHO is the best song on this CD. Its almost a companion to Outlaw Torn on Load; an 8 minute progressive song with some great guitar work, and lots of emotion. A great way to finish the album. <br /> <br />Overall, this is about a 4 star album. There's quite a few good to great songs on this CD, but some fairly average ones that drag the quality down as a whole. It isn't as well rounded as Load, but if you're open minded its a worthwhile investment. <br />
B00004Y6NP|5.0|A new 20th anniversary edition is issued in Europe and around the world.  The sound quality is much much better.
B000002HMH|5.0|I was VERY apprehensive about load to begin with. It was the last studio album that I bought, after having acquired all the earlier 80's MEtallica, and the Black album. THe reason? All the negative press from many of the people that loved 80s Metallica; mainly hardcore bogans.. The advice was usually 'don't buy it, its crap'. But when I inquired as to why it was crap, most people couldn't give me much of an answer. 'Its too mainstream' 'not heavy enough' 'sell out' was about as profound as the reasons came. Anyway I had faith in Metallica back then (before St Anger), so I bought Load because it couldn't possibly be 'that bad'. <br /> <br />My instincts proved me correct. There's no reason that I can see to justify viewing load as 'absolute crap' or anything close to that. On the contrary, it has lots of good songs on it. I don't want to be one of those fence sitters who says 'its just different' without accepting that something can be 'different and yet still bad'. Yet this is perhaps the best way to describe this album. Load isn't like older Metallica. It has a lot in common with the Black Album in style, with some more progressive elements and stylistic changes. (eg Mama Said - all acoustic 'country esque' tune) <br /> <br />THere's a lot to like on this CD for the open minded fan. Aint My Bitch, House that Jack Built, Until it Sleeps, Hero of the Day, Outlaw Torn, Thorn Within, to name a few. I'm not really that keen on 2x4 but hey its not bad. THere's nothing on this album that pains me to listen to it, unlike the HORRIBLE St Anger. My personal favourite is the beautiful 'Bleeding Me'. <br /> <br />So whats all the negative press about? I'm not going to justify my view by saying 'bands evolve - this is an evolution so its good.' Evolution can be a BAD thing if the music suffers. St Anger was an 'evolution' again (or more of a devolution) but it was absolute TOSH. Just because Metallica changed again didn't make the album not rubbish. WHats the difference then, between their change to that, and their change from the more complex, 80's style Metal into the style we hear on load? THe answer is simple - on Load, Metallica still demonstrate good songwriting <br /> <br />Ask yourself this - what do you want from Metallica? If you're only interested in really complex instrumentation, then load may not deliver for you. Go and buy music that caters for that; Steve Vai/Victor Wootton etc. Lars has downsized his drumkit and has dispensed with lots of pretty/extravagent tom fills in favour of keeping a tighter grip on things. But there's still a lot of creative drum work, its just more subtle. Listen to all the variations with the kick pedal/splash in Outlaw Torn and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br />Load wasn't meant to emulate 80's Metallica, this much is clear. The band was evidently comfortable with what they'd done prior to load and wanted to keep themselves interested in music. They'd shown what they could do, technically speaking, they probably just wanted to write songs and try and stay relevant in the different climate of the mid 90's. <br /> <br />Load isn't Master of Puppets, and it never pretends to be. It doesn't try to be technically complex. That being said, Metallica really does deliver on this album as far as music is concerned. The boys still deliver some great songs that are easy to like. Again - this is why Load is good and St Anger isn't. Load was an evolution, but Metallica still produced good music and good songs. You'll still see some great songwriting on Load. St Anger was also an evolution, but Metallica decided to attempt to appease all the 'I dont like it if its not heavy' crowd, and so dispense with melody/rhythm and good songwriting in favour of white noise and tin can drumming.  <br /> <br />I know what I'd rather listen to.... <br /> <br />So overall, be open minded. Don't expect another Master of Puppets/And Justice for All. Expect an album full of great songs that you enjoy listening to. Don't expect heaviness for heaviness' sake (*Cough* St Anger) - expect to hear good music, and you may just find that you love this album.  <br /> <br />
0471702188|5.0|This is the best book of it's kind on the market.  Do yourself and your business a favor and read it.
0451199871|4.0|Agatha Christie (1890-1976) is the best known mystery novelist of the 20th Century--and with good reason, for when it came to plots, truly fiendish plots, she could easily out-construct all competitors.  She also had a knack for writing tongue-in-cheek, exhibiting a sly sense of humor for those sharp enough to catch it.  The 1942 THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY is an excellent example of both.<br /><br />The title is a classic cliche, immediately bringing to mind an old fashioned whodunit of the Mary Roberts Rinehart type, the sort of novel in which an improbable victim is discovered in an impossible setting.  But Christie twists the cliche, playing upon the idea in an darkly comic sort of way.  After all, what would you do if you awoke one morning to find a bleached blonde strangled to death and tossed on the library floor before the fireplace?<br /><br />As it happens--and most fortunately--Col. and Mrs. Bantry know an expert in all things homocidal: everyone's favorite spinster lady, Miss Marple.  When the victim is traced to a nearby resort, Mrs. Bantry wastes little time in booking rooms for both Miss Marple and herself and the hunt is on, complete with a series of unbreakable alibis, hidden motives, and a classic Christie plot twist at the end.<br /><br />THE BODY IN THE LIBRARY does not really compete with Christie's absolute best--but then few titles, regardless of author, do.  But it is among her most witty works, a fast-paced read that can be swallowed whole in a single sitting.  Recommended.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
B00000ILDE|3.0|It's funny that I went and saw Aliens when it originally came out and all but forgotten much about it since I haven't seen much of the movie since then. I seem to recall CBS airing the movie seen on this DVD with much if not all of its extended scenes and I don't think that version was ever aired again on network TV. So I'm now pretty glad that Aliens in all of its entirety is now on DVD. <br /> <br />But sad to say, the DVD is a slight let-down. Nothing major, just the sound quality not being equal jumping from soft, almost indistinguishable dialogue to loud gunfire and explosions. I either had to suddenly turn the sound up or suddenly turn it down; there was no midway. <br /> <br />And I was disappointed with the special features-- also because of the sound. There were great behind-the-scenes segments showing how the models were made, showing how the Alien queen was opereated, what when on inside the face-huggers, etc. Great stuff, but there was no sound! You would think there would be a bit of background music or some narration, but we get nothing to <br />show for such great scenes but dead silence, except in just one segment. <br /> <br />If it wasn't for those problems with the sound, I would give the movie five stars, but I can't do that, so I give only three although it really deserves more.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Tim Burton has almost always managed to please me with his directorial turns.  The only film of his that I haven't enjoyed was \\"Batman Returns,\\" because I felt he took a little too much artistic license on that one.  In \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,\\" we have a twisted children's tale that seems to be tailored to Burton's vision.<br /><br />I'll bet that most folks are more familiar with the Gene Wilder \\"Wonka\\" of years past instead of Roald Dahl's wonderful book.  With that in mind, I'll use the Wilder feature for comparison.  First off, Johnny Depp is pretty good as Wonka.  He's somewhat creepy, with a look and tone almost like Michael Jackson.  He doesn't care for families that much, due to his own sick childhood.  In fact, he's more like a grown-up Peter Pan.  He seems to want to live in a fantasy world where he rules with a sugar-coated smile.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is nice.  The kid who plays Charlie has wonderful appeal.  Veruca Salt, Violet Beauregard, and Mike Teavee are also cast very well.  They are brats, and fit this story well.  The only kid I had a problem with was Augustus Gloop.  He almost looked fake.  He had a Wesson-like glow to his skin that made him appear unnatural and disturbing.  The adults were cast pretty good also.<br /><br />The Oompa Loompas were peculiar.  They shared the same face and were much smaller than the ones in the old version of the film.  I did enjoy their musical numbers in this flick more than in the original.<br /><br />The fates of each of the bratty children were well executed, but might scare the little ones.<br /><br />Overall, this is a twisted look at a story that was already twisted.  I enjoyed it, but I don't know how well it will go over with other folks.  For the adults in the audience, it's probably going to be a walk down memory lane.  For children uninitiated, it might be a little bit too different than their modern, politically-correct world where everybody's a winner and nobody's a bad person.<br /><br />Tim Burton is creepy.  I don't think anyone would argue with me on that.  In turn, he makes \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" even creepier.  Recommended for families with older kids(5 and up) since a few of the scenes(especially the demise of Veruca Salt) may come across a little bit too scary for the young'uns.bad person. <br /> <br />Tim Burton is creepy.

B00005JNSK|3.0|5 lucky kids get a chance of a lifetime. They get to go inside Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory by trying to find 5 golden tickets in Wonka Bars. They enter the big gate, escorted each by a parent as they walk closely to the huge factory, the voice on the speaker tells them to come to the big front doors. The door slides open and a cheerful song with dolls and stuff blows into flames...then beside them they hear clapping...they turn as they see Willy Wonka standing there clapping, cheering. Anyway, after this ordeal, he brings them into the factory. He leads them around his crazy chocolate factory where the kids see things...wonderful and strange things. Only Tim Burton can pull this off and who better then to be Willy Wonka then have Johnny Depp (Tim Burton's Corpse Bride, Blow) in the drivers seat. It's hard to compare Depp's with Gene Wilder's performance in the 70's because Depp doesnt even touch Wilder's performance, he makes his own and might I say his performance is demented, dimwitted and fun. Some of the OopaLoompa songs get kinda annoying and their really tiny then the 70s version and their all played by the same guy. I think this movie put in things what the original didnt, like how did Willy Wonka come upon the OopaLoompa world and it even flashes back to his childhood where he has a strick Dentist father played by none other then the legendary Christopher Lee (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy). The cast includes Freddie Highmore (Finding Neverland) as Charlie Bucket, Noah Taylor (Vanilla Sky) and Helena Bonham Carter (Big Fish, Fight Club) as his parents, David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) as Grampa Joe and Missi Pyle and Violet's Mother. I grew up with the 70's version but I like this one too..I cant choose which one I like so I'll just decide on liking them both equally.
B00014K5TQ|3.0|I must say, when I heard that Macaulay would be portraying Michael Alig in the screen version of James St. James \\"Disco Bloodbath,\\" I was a little bit skeptical at what might be found.<br /><br />The movie beings with Seth Green (St. James) and Macaulay (Alig), just as in the novel.  The narraration seems to be more from Alig's view, rather than St. James, but none-the-less is entertaining.<br /><br />Seth Green deserves to be declared genius for his dead on portrayal of St. James.  His quirky, semi-cocky attitude were to a T.  He pulled off the Club Kid clothing so well, I'm surprised he doesn't wear it on a regular basis by this point.<br /><br />Macaulay does better than anyone could possibly expect, considering he's been gone since his \\"Home Alone\\" days.  If anyone has ever seen an interview with Alig (Such as \\"Party Monster: The Shockumentary\\"), his portrayal of the king of club kids was unbelievable.  You could tell he spent hours watching video footage of Michael himself in order to do a convincing job.  After all, if making a true story into a movie, it deserves to be successful, correct?  Not to mention, he looks absolutely fabulous in make-up.<br /><br />And Chloe Sevigny does an amazing job as Gitsy, Michael's young and quirky girlfriend.  She didn't have very many lines, as apparently in reality Gitsy wouldn't speak very much unless spoken to, at Michael's request.  Instead, she gets to look absolutely stunning in her nurse outfit, and make you pity the life she was brought into for fame (and following -- her death by overdose).<br /><br />This movie is a must view, however I only gave it 3 stars because it didn't share the same wit as the book it was based on.  However, any fan of the story will thoroughly enjoy the movie, and should also find the time to read the novel if at all possible.
0792164903|5.0|When I first read that Tim Burton would be doing a remake of 'The Headless Horseman' tale, I couldn't wait. After I found out Johnny Depp was cast as Ichabod Crane, I flipped. THEN, I see a unique and awesome cast made up of Christina Ricci, Casper Van Dien, Christopher Walken AND Christopher Lee in the movie?!?! Truly a slice of Horror Heaven! Exceptional scenery, acting and atmosphere, this is as good as it gets when it comes to modern day horror movies, (eventhough it was set in the late 1700's). One of Johhny Depp's best performances and a one of a kind horror movie. Definitely worth the price of admission and worth watching more than once.

1592400876|5.0|OR - A WOMAN: WITHOUT HER, MAN IS NOTHING <br /> <br />How in the world does a simple book on punctuation get to be a best seller?  I think the catchy title helped attract attention - but the success of this book has to do with the outrageous, irreverent wit and personal charm of the author.  She writes about punctuation the way Erma Bombeck (bless her soul) used to write about being a housewife.  From page one, she points out how horrible life is for a stickler for punctuation, when most people \\"don't know their apostrophe from their elbow.\\"  You squirm with her as she gives unending examples of butchered grammar in public places.  As a teen, while other girls were \\"out getting abortions,\\" she resorted to midnight vigilante activities with white paint and magic marker on incorrect grocery store signs.  This author admits to mostly presenting an apology - a justification for existence - for punctuation.  Punctuation is traffic signs directing flow...If punctuation is the stitching of language; take the buttons off and the sentence falls apart...It's not the fault of the apostrophe that words need help identifying themselves...don't be the guy who believed there was no limit to the amount of clarification that could be accomplished if he just kept adding commas. <br /> <br />There have been great historical moments for punctuation:  The King James committee that allowed for Purgatory (pleasing the pope), or not (appeasing the protestants), by the placement of a comma (page 74, Luke 23: 43).  Apparently it was up for grabs because the Greeks didn't believe in punctuation.  A war was started by a confusing written message that could have been clarified by a comma.  \\"But heigh ho,\\" Truss says.   <br /> <br />Truss finally gets around to giving us some nuts and bolts:  The period is easy because it's so straightforward -  either it's there or it's not.  Apostrophes and commas have a few very definite rules, then a few irregular rules, then it becomes somewhat self-expressive and discretionary.  (I wonder, should I have used commas, semicolons or hyphens to punctuate the previous sentence! And should that exclamation point be a question mark)?  Should that question mark have gone inside the parenthesis?  There are fewer rules for explanation points, parentheses, dashes, elipses (which I like for lists of broken quotes but probably shouldn't use), semi-colons and colons.  In some cases it depends on whether you live East or West of the Atlantic ocean - and a huge faux pax on a seventh grade paper could be a clever syntactic move for Kurt Vonnegut.   <br /> <br />In this read, getting there is half the fun.  Imagine a book where suspense builds, as one wonders if he/she is ever going to get to the rules of punctuation.  For those who say, \\"What's the big deal - if I get my point across, that's all that counts!\\" - don't bother with this little book.  Instead, go wash your pick-up.  But if you're a little of a stickler yourself, you'll like it.
B00003CXCT|4.0|Yes, I'm another old-school fan of the original trilogy.  In fact, I have the original trilogy on laserdisc and transfered it to DVD for my own personal use, but the picture and sound quality is not up to par with modern DVDs.  It's better than VHS, but not quite good enough for the modern audiophile.    The sole reason I bought this set was to see and hear it on my home theater system.  I must say, the picture and sound quality is better than any Star Wars version I've ever seen.  My house literally shook when the Star Destroyers rolled across the screen.  Laser blasts seem to come at you from all directions as you become more and more immersed in the Star Wars universe.  In that aspect, it more than lived up to my expectations, hence the four-star rating. It does have a few audio inconsistencies which I expected since the movie is 28 years old, but it's nothing major. I had to take off one star out of spite, however.  Well-justified spite.    Visuals and acoustics aside, George Lucas killed the nostalgia of Star Wars when he made the special edition changes.  I see many kids writing reviews saying how much they love the changes, stop complaining, and so on and so forth, but many of them had never even *seen* the original trilogy before the prequels were released.  Obviously Episodes I, II, and III created a whole new generation of Star Wars fans.  Good for them; I hope their memories of the version they love will remain as fond as mine have for the version I love.    Therein lies the problem.  George has basically spit on my memories as well as those of other Star Wars purists who made him who he is today through our monetary support.  The ONLY special edition changes I can deal with are the explosions and improved quality of the picture and sound.  Everything else was either totally wrong to change or unnecessary to include.  I literally cringe when I see the special edition version of Jabba's palace in ROTJ.  Aweful.  And what's the deal with that scrawny, misshapen Jabba in A New Hope?  Did he really change that much in 5 years?  Why, oh WHY did he change the song in the Ewok village at the end of ROTJ?  That was the last thing I remembered about the original trilogy as a kid, and he destroyed it.  And I can't even bring myself to discuss how Lucas disrespected Sebastian Shaw (old Vader's ghost) by replacing him with Hayden Christensen during the final scene of the trilogy.  My god.    In conclusion, I'm glad that George finally released the trilogy on DVD, but I believe he should have more respect for his loyal, die-hard fans and release the original, unadulterated version on DVD as well.  If the purists didn't support him back in the day, there would BE no Episodes I, II, and III. There would BE no new generation of Star Wars fans.  Why he fails to realize this is beyond my comprehension.    I may bring out this set in case I'm entertaining a few youngsters or people who don't know much about the original trilogy, but I'll always prefer the 1995 laserdisc versions myself.
B00005JM02|4.0|This is one fantastic animated movie! Perfect for all ages. <br />It looks incredible in HD, if you have a bigscreen t.v.
B000683VI4|4.0|This movie passed me by when it first came out and I admit it didn't really appear on my radar until the 2005 MTV movie awards when Rachel McAdams cleaned up for her performances in both 'Mean Girls' and 'The Notebook'.<br /><br />It's not a perfect movie due to a couple of outlandish and disjointed scenes (the World War II frontline scene in particular) but that's forgiveable since the romantic storyline is timeless. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are well suited to their roles.<br /><br />The strong supporting cast, nostalgic reproduction of a bygone era and beautiful cinematography makes this movie more than worth the time.<br /><br />To the girls I can only say be prepared with the Kleenex, they rarely make them like this anymore.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Ruined THE HULK's character by animating. The television series, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, was much better compared to the movie. This was really disappointing!!! The only reason this was given 1 star because I like the character, The Hulk, but the movie was a total waste of time!
B000003TAW|4.0|Weezer is a trip back in time for me.  I remember my first time hearing Undone- The Sweater Song back in 1994.  I thought it was quirky and cool and promptly went out to get their CD.  And when that one recently got scratched up by my young daughter, I went out to buy another copy.  Yeah, it is that good. <br /> <br />Undone, Buddy Holly, and Say It Ain't So (my very favorite) were the singles and they are great, but so are the remaining tracks.  In fact, if Only In Dreams wasn't eight minutes long, I would have wished for it to be a single.  I love the slow build up and the memorable bass line to this song.  Holiday is another good, upbeat song. <br /> <br />Get this album if you liked any of the singles off of it.  I doubt you'll be disappointed!
B00080ZG1A|4.0|The Aviator was an interesting and engaging movie . Leonardo De Caprio was indeed a talented actor and not just a pretty face. His portrayal of Howard .H was quite realistic and remarkable. The costumes and the setting were excellent. Cate Blanchette played an excellent portrayal of Katherine Hepburn. However, I do not think there was any chemistry between her and Leo. She looks more like his mother than his lover (although, she may be only a few years older than Leo). Kate Beckinsale also looks much older than the 'baby face' Leo. If the casting director wants to make the characters more convincing he/she should have considered a more mature looking actor to portray Howard H. or chose younger looking leading ladies for Leo. Overall, the movie was quite impressive; the strory was not slow and boring,and only significant part of Howard's biography were shown (meaning there were no unnecessary or irrelevant dialogues or scenes in the movie). However, it is possible that the ending might disappoint you.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|It seems 1990's rock and roll has been coming back with a vengeance this year.  The first half of the 2000's saw Hip Hop gaining market prominence even among suburbanites.  Nonetheless, much like disco in the late 1970's, once Hip Hop acts appeared on the front covers of Rolling Stone one knew the Western world would be moving on.  However much you like watching music videos with young women in bikinis dancing around swimming pools while the singer turns out crafty rhymes, after a while it sinks in that these guys are just Hugh Heffner wannabes and/or these gangster bad boys wouldn't last five minutes in downtown Baghdad.  Nothing against the \\"bad boys\\"; but they pale in comparison to the marines who took Falujah in terms of courage, firepower and lethalness.  This is one case where in a battle between fantasy and the real reality wins out.  This a long way to saying that for some reason every time war or national tragedy rears its ugly head rock and roll returns to center stage.<br /><br />Not that Oasis exactly has been away.  With their first album, DEFINITELY MAYBE, Oasis caught the favorable attention of an assortment of critics and tastemakers.  Then in 1995, Oasis released their magnum opus in WHAT'S THE STORY MORNING GLORY.  So powerful was MORNING GLORY that it remains one of the very best albums of that decade.  It was then the Gallaghers' strong affinity for the Beatles became apparent.  Not only did Oasis employ a host of musical \\"Beatle-isms\\" in their songs and their worldview recalled the latter idealism of the Fab Four; but in terms of pattern and feel MORNING GLORY roughly resembled SGT. PEPPER.  It also didn't hurt that MORNING GLORY was very much a GUITAR album.  Instead of being vilified as copycats, Oasis enjoyed a royal honeymoon with critics and public alike for several months.<br /><br />But then Oasis began a series of missteps.  Press members were abused during interviews.  Legendary fights on jet flights got them banned from several carriers for life.  The Gallagher brothers fought with each other in public.  Liam, the lead singer, walked out on the band at the beginning of a major U.S. tour-leaving the much less capable Noel to carry the vocal chores for the rest of those dates.  Original band members either left the band or were fired.  They pissed off George Harrison.  Then came the major mistake of BE HERE NOW.<br /><br />In all fairness, anything Oasis could have done could not have stood next to MORNING GLORY.  But BE HERE NOW suffered from serious alcohol and drug over-indulgence that manifested itself in all the dials thrown to the max and an overblown delusion of grandeur.  It was like a badly intoxicated drunk suddenly deciding to take on Mohammed Ali in his prime.  Oasis simply got knocked to the floor.  The once darlings of the rock glitterati got themselves banished to exile in obscurity.<br /><br />Cleaned up and dried out, Oasis picked themselves up and released one decent album, a collection of their non-album cuts, and an excellent \\"live\\" record-all of which were largely ignored.  All this began to change with HEATHEN CHEMISTRY.  The band came back with a new confidence and aggressiveness that recalled the days of DEFINITELY MAYBE.  That renewed spirit has put itself on the forefront of DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH.<br /><br />As Zak Starkey remarks in the documentary on the dual disc version of DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH., Oasis is a hard working band that shows up at the studio early and leaves late with little in the way of breaks in between.  You don't find a band wondering what to do next as they hold a wetted finger to see which way the wind is blowing.  The Gallaghers are holding to the band's original vision and they've got something to say whether the world listens or not.<br /><br />After first listening to DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH., what struck me was the album's unusual structure.  It is made up of three song cycles with three songs each; then remains two songs at the end that canbe taken by themselves.  Whether by design or it was just easier to program the album this way, it is beneficial to recognize these song cycles as such because several of the songs end oddly unless you understand that musically you are being lead to the next song.<br /><br />\\"Turn Up The Sun\\"/\\"Mucky Fingers\\"'/Lyla starts off with no introduction right into the fray.  \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" is a complex song combining both a pleasant soft minor key progression of notes with a hard edge plea of love and brotherhood.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" and \\"Lyla\\" by contrast have a garage band thrashing with beats like a constant hammer.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" recalls a HIGHWAY 61/BLONDE ON BLONDE era Dylan sneer at what we commonly believe to be the truth.  \\"Lyla\\" by contrast brings the Kinks to mind as an appeal to what appears to be a universal feminine spirit of love.<br /><br />\\"Love like a Bomb\\"/\\" The Importance of Being Idle\\"/\\"The Meaning of the Soul\\" form a humorous trio that makes jokes at different levels.  \\"Love like a Bomb\\" is a largely acoustic song at heart which compares/contrasts love with exploding munitions.  \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" at first appears to be one of Oasis' nonsense songs in which the singer is completely unconcerned with the necessities of life.  (It could also be a wry comment reminding the listener not to confuse living with acquiring the requirements to live.)  \\"The Meaning of the Soul\\" is the \\"flip\\" side of \\"Importance\\" in that the singer romances his love in a rapid almost machine cadence with the ironic promise to teach her about \\"soul\\".<br /><br />\\"Guess God Thinks I'm Able\\"/\\"Part Of The Queue\\"/\\"Keep The Dream Alive\\"  returns to the themes of the first song cycle-in a way.  \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Able\\" is as lovely acoustic ballad Oasis has ever recorded.  Lyrically it lays out choices everyone has before them in love and and hate.  \\"Guess God\\" ends oddly sliding into \\"Part of the Queue\\"-marking the confusions of modern life in the spiritless ness of city life.  The triad ends with \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\"-- a characteristically (for Oasis) dreamy anthem march for peace, understanding and love.<br /><br />The album ends with two songs that for me seem to hang on like appendixes to the main body.  \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" harks back to the Beatles' \\"Rain\\"; while \\"Let There Be Love\\" begins with that lonely hollow piano sound John Lennon used in his early solo career that suddenly evolves into an \\"All You Need Is Love\\" chorus faithfully equipped with slow drums and synth washes.  I don't care for these two songs as much as the rest of the album and they do have a \\"tacked on\\" air about them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good album that holds up under repeated listenings.  I am not prepared to say this CD is essential the way \\"Morning Glory\\" is and was.  But it is far more interesting than 95% of other releases this year.<br /><br />The flip side of the dualdisc version has the entire album in \\"enhanced stereo\\", a documentary, and the music video of \\"Lyla\\".

B00000DHRZ|3.0|ok, I'm not going complain about how this was there major sellout album or whatever. I'm rating this three stars for the music and nothing else. There are a few really good tracks on here, but it doesn't totally make up for the majority.  <br /> <br />Highlights include: No Brakes, Pay the Man, Staring at the Sun, Have you Ever, and End of the Line was pretty decent. Everything else is pretty much the poppy watered down Offspring that we know today. <br /> <br />I think these songs (as well as the rest) would be greatly improved IF, Dexters vocals didn't sound as produced. He used to have such a unique, raw voice, but since Americana, that quality has been lost. I think the main factor was switching to a major label..but whatever. To each their own, right?
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Firstly, to the guy below that commented about what he thought were \\"homosexual\\" references in Sufjan's music, listen more closely next time.  The man is religious, he's referring to God. <br /> <br />That said. <br /> <br />This album is really amazing.  I love Sufjan's music.  He incorporates so many different instruments and sounds into each of his albums that sometimes they can have a certain repetitive nature to them after repeated listening.  As much as I love Seven Swans for instance, a few of the songs linger on at the same pace for a bit longer then can hold your attention each and every listen. <br /> <br />With Illinois, however, he's nailed it.  Even a 6+min song like Chicago moves along with enough momentum that you never realize how long the song actually is until you look at the track time. <br /> <br />All the additional instrumentation blends together beautifully and many of the songs leave you feeling deeply moved. <br /> <br />What state will be next?
0140187537|5.0|Reader seeking to identify fictional people and places here described would do better to inspect their own communities and search their own hearts, for this book is about a large part of America today--Preface<br /><br />  Written in 1961, these words are as pertinent today--perhaps even more so.  A social protest novel like THE GRAPES OF WRATH, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT tackles the moral corruption that Steinbeck perceived in America during the era of the quiz show scandals in the late 1950s.  Reflecting on the recent corporate and plagiarism scandales, readers today will have no trouble relating to Steinbeck's setting.  Just as importantly, however, readers will have no trouble identifying with the book's characters.<br /><br />  Named for the famous speech of Richard III, WINTER takes place during a period of peace following a protracted conflict.  Like Richard Gloucester, Steinbeck's protagonist, Ethan Allen Hawley, gets ahead by betraying a brother.  Driven by the demands of his wife and children that he acquire more money and public prestige, Hawley cheats his closest boyhood friend out of land coveted by developers.  As with Richard's attrocities, each bad deed leads to more (and worse) deeds.<br /><br />  But whereas Shakespeare depicts evil as flowing from the depraved character of Richard, Steinbeck attributes his hero's shortcomings to society itself.  As with his other books, Steinbeck portrays human beings as naturally good individuals  corrupted by their economic and social surroundings.  This idea is debatable to say the least, but there's no question that Steinbeck makes a good case. Reading Ethan's reflections on his own community and witnessing the consequences of all types of greed is like watching QUIZ SHOW, the Redford film depicting the same era.<br /><br />  As with his other works, WINTER is full of characters respresenting various sides of socieity but having sppech and habits that defy any stereotype.  Like GRAPES, Winter combines the best of literary naturalism and romanticism.  But even more than GRAPES, the plot and characters of WINTER continue to be \\"about a large part of America today.\\"ry naturalism and romanticism.  But even more than GRAPES, the plot and characters of WINTER continue to be \\"about a large part of America today.\\"

B00005JNSK|5.0|I thought this movie was magnificent. Johnny Depp does an excellent job playing the role of the brilliant and famous chocolatier, Willy Wonka. I would reccomend that everyone see it, no matter what age, it's a great film that allows your wildest fantasies to come to life!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A western set in space? Is that the most stupid idea ever? That was my first thought, but after seeing the first episode it had me hook, line and sinker. Joss is, once again, king of series tv. Not only because of putting this idea together, but also for finding the writers who can carry it off with the style that is this series. <br />     I am in love with this show so I am trying not to get mushy, but the characters are to die for. They are all so real, yet bigger than life. Captain Mal, while having a hidden soft side, is not someone that you would want angry at you. He WILL get the job done. Jayne is a character unto himself. He is hysterical at times. While he is the \\"muscle\\" in the show and I don't think you are really supposed to like him, he is adorable. Maybe not someone you would want to marry, but someone you certainly would want to date. Book...hummm...you have to wonder about him. Zoe and Wash are great together. A perfect blend. Wash is a scene stealer too. Simon and River are great to watch. You are always wondering what is coming up with the two of them. Inara and Kaylee are beautiful. You never get tired of the two of them. <br />     The main storyline rolls on show after show and never loses your attention. The substories are true treasures. If you have any interest in an engaging story, great effects and pure pleasure, this is the DVD for you. <br />     And a hearty \\"Hurray\\" that Serenity the movie will be coming out in theaters this fall. <br />     I am just thankful that I have DVD sets like this one so that I am spared that horrible reality tv that is everywhere now. Are there so few writers and ideas left that we are stuck with idiots on an island for entertainment?
6305291446|5.0|I avoided seeing this movie for years, appalled at the unpecedented way it just acted like nothing from \\"Halloween II\\" onward ever happened.  It's certainly not without precedent for a series to get its continuity mixed up after a number of sequels, but to actually try and delete several whole movies from the timeline?!?  It was only that trailers for \\"Halloween Resurrection\\" looked so good that I finally had to capitulate and take up the series again, finding to my shock that \\"H20\\" is actually one of the best chapters in the entire run, and, ironically, better than \\"Resurrection\\" would turn out to be. <br /> <br />I was never against Jamie Lee Curtis returning to the series as Laurie Strode, but I don't think it was necesary to skip over the several preceding entries.  As it is, there are now two seperate Halloween continuities - well, actually three because \\"Season Of The Witch\\" is out there on its own with no real connection to any of the others (it's kind of a shame they even called it \\"Halloween III\\"; it was a great movie on its own that probably would have been much more appreciated if everybody hadn't been understandably befuddled about the abscence of Michael Myers et al.).  There's Halloween 1 & 2 plus 4 through 6 (released as \\"The Curse Of The Michael Myers\\" without a \\"Part Six\\" marker) and then we have a second timeline, again starting with Halloween Parts 1 & 2 but not picking up until H20 and those that follow it.  If anybody ever manages to stitch this all back together into a coherent single line God bless them.  To be fair, the H20 makers do make a bit of an acknowledgement to the 'skipped-over' installments - Laurie Strode faked her death in a car accident in this new continuity.  Those who remember the old continuity will recall that in Part 4 (which I believe may be my personal favorite) it was revealed in the opening minutes that Laurie was absent because she died in a car crash.  Couldn't they have gone one step further, made some referrence to Michael Myers copycat killers over the years between Part II and H20 and left us with the impression that the Thorn Cult arranged for things to be covered up so that everybody would believe Michael was dead and his appearances in 4-6 were somebody else (viewers would know better of course)?  But then that would have left the question of why Laurie left her daughter behind when she took up a new identity and life.  Maybe they just really had to go this way to tell this particular story that they wanted to tell. <br /> <br />And that story picks up twenty years after the night on which both Halloween and Halloween II took place, with Laurie, under her new name, well settled into a new life, with a teenage son and a job at a college, but still haunted by the irrational fear that someday Michael is going to return and track her down despite neither hide nor hair (nor Part 4, 5 or 6; but I guess I'm beating that point to death now) of him having been seen in two decades.  And after all those years, he does indeed once again Come Back.  Removed from most of the previous sequels, they've gone back to a Michael Myers not significantly more powerful than he was on the original Night, stronger and more unstoppable than any human should be but not to the extent he'd achieve in the later sequels; this plays well - in both H20 and Resurrection if he was still the force he was by Chapter 6 he'd carve through anything in his path like a hot knife through butter, both movies taking place (especially Resurrection) in a more confined envirornment.  Here that envirornment is an almost deserted college campus when just about everyone is off on an extended break, and because of his still formidable but much lesser power level the other side actually has a realistic fighting chance against him. <br /> <br />Fine cast and fine cast of characters: Jodi Lyn O'Keefe in particular stood out for me.  (While I'm on the subject of O'Keefe, one of horror's best actresses, can some distributor out there PLEASE release \\"Red Rover\\", which stars her,William Baldwin, Brenda James (aka Brenda Lynn Klemme of \\"Cutting Class\\" and \\"The Channeller\\"!) and Charlie Rhindress either theatrically or on DVD?  It debuted in 2003 at film festivals, apparantly impressed both horror fans and non-horror fans, and it's still without wide distribution?  Don't let this be another Sector 13, which we're Still waiting for, after all these years...If Sector 13's copyright holder is listening?....still waiting, it's not too late.....still waiting......waiting....) Back to H20, the characters are all Likable, and all add to the movie with their own personalities. <br /> <br />H20 and all that follows are not a replacement for Halloween Parts 4-6; they exist In Addition to them and I've realized you don't have to choose one or the other.  Anybody still holding off on seeing this because of the continuity issue, don't keep making the mistake I made - this is a great movie no matter what the continuity.  And any newer fans who've Only seen 1 & 2 plus H20 and Resurrection, skipping the others because they're not part of the current timeline, you might want to consider going back and checking them out.  There's not a clunker among them, whether or not they ever end up linked back into the newer movies.  Same for Part III - a great movie that deserves to be judged on its own merits and not summarily dismissed because it's unconnected to the rest.
B0000019PA|5.0|I could be totally wrong of course, but perhaps Mr. Mangum (sp?) of NMH did not make any more NMH albums after this, because, basically, he said something very deep and very eternal with this work, and it was said in i would say a perfect way. Perhaps he saw no more need to do art, which i would understand. There are very few works of art in history that are complete and whole on their own, and mysteriously do the job of going to the center of your being and connecting, strongly and directly. with whatever that is. \\"In the aeroplane...\\" does it. who cares why. it's just completely and utterly awesome! one of the finest pieces of music ever made. i cannot listen to it in the background, i can't turn it off when it's going. i don't know how NMH did it, i am just glad i lived to hear it.
B0000E2FLC|1.0|Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD version of Donington. They aren't overdubbed with other audio tracks. For instance, during Shoot to Thrill, Brian screams something, but his microphone is on his belt. During Back in Black. He says \\"hey mama\\" but his mike is no where near his mouth. One of the solos doesn't line up during Fire Your Guns. Thunderstruck even sounds different. There are lots of differences in the US DVD. I don't have time to name them all. The undoctored versions  of the show also LOOK DIFFERENT. The show took place near a storm, but on the US DVD, there aren't any storm clouds. The sound is great, but its not from Donington. The original video and audio was fine. They should've left it alone. I strongly discourage the buying of this DVD. Buy the VHS or Brazilian DVD to get the full effect of the show.
0060005688|1.0|Choosing can be hard, psychological transaction costs if you will.  But the book concludes that these costs, because they can be high, means that more is less.  As is all too common in these big idea books, there are some interesting ideas but the book fails to move satisfyingly beyond the main idea (say, to the unintended consequences of limiting choice).  Hopefully all the readers that like the book and take its ideas to heart will focus on improving their own lives and not mine.
0156027321|4.0|I thought this true story a work of fiction; it is that real.  The story is told in the first person but is the retelling of a great adventure of a young Indian boy who through ship wreck rides the high seas for several months before being rescued.  Rescued along with his Bengal tiger Richard Parker! <br /> <br />This book has great force through the images it projects and the beautiful details that compose those images.  It is powerful and powerfully told not in its grandness but in its boldness of truth and disclosure. It is like Biology class when you look into the microscope for the first time and see the surprising detail there and think, so this is life. <br /> <br />Such stories can have a very real impact on one's life.  There is enough truth and so well concentrated that it performs the purpose of a lens. Somehow taking you through it, through the story, and transforming things within you as if sifting and shifting light rays. <br /> <br />The story is well worth the reading if only to be in the sea and know it for what it is.  Pi is in the sea for a very long time and describes absolutely everything that goes on while a castaway.  One is reminded of Heyerdahl's  \\"Kon-Tiki\\" or Carson's \\"Silent Spring\\" the science of the sea is so complete. As you read you think you never knew the sea and it makes one ask `what else don't I know'. <br /> <br />Let us not forget the tiger Richard Parker!  It's hard to even imagine being adrift on the sea-close to starving for months.  Imagine now that you had to keep your pet tiger well fed or else he would starve along with you.  Only he would be forced to eat you before he starved-his instincts are wild.  You could swim away I suppose but you would then drown for sure.  The strategies that Pi uses to keep the two alive are as intriguing as any mystery or thriller and so much more real. <br /> <br />The believability of this true story hangs on the fact that Pi grew up working in his father's zoo in India and has encyclopedic knowledge of the ways of animals.  If it were not for this fact it would not be believed so fantastic is the tale.  Don't miss it.  Don't miss the boat, it is sailing into very exotic seas of knowledge about the world and the way we are when all is stripped away. <br />
0385507755|3.0|Below is an Opinion ....which are like noses...everyone has one.    Firsly I think James is a Jerk. And thats exactly what he whats you to know ...that he is a Jerk of the highest order and I think he intentionally writes like a Jerk in that Jerky grammarless style because he is admitting that he is a Jerk that questions why you should follow normal writing procedures normal drug rehab normal everything everything.    Poor little rich kid: Yep, but thats not his fault that his folks are rich.      The Dentist:  I wanna beleive this bit.  I used to get all my dental work done as a youngster, back in the 1970's, without a pain-killer because I was too scared of the needle that administered the pain-killer. Mind you, this was only routine cavity work.  It still hurt like hell, but I was just too scared of the needle, so I put up with the pain.    But Root-canal without pain-killers? I don't discount it - but still find it hard to belevie.    Lilly: I think she is a figment of imagination.    Leonard: see above.    Miles the Judge: see above.    Mind you - one day it might be proven that all these people were real and what happened was real - so I will be prepared to eat humble pie.    In then end - this guy has probably  made alot of money out of his book, and most of the people criticising it are just damn annoyed that they didn't think of it first.    I still enjoyed the book, and would have given it 5 stars with better grammar and if he didn't bs with some of the characters.    I am waiting to eat humble pie ............
B000002P2W|5.0|Surprisingly this album got me hooked on The Who. I only thought Squeeze Box was the breakthrough on this album. The other songs such as How Many Friends and They Are All In Love quickly pulls me in. Red Blue & Grey added a lot of depth as you can tell how the band struts around the Who's Next and Quadraphenia era albums. Success Story and Imagine A Man clearly comes from the bands energy in the lines like smashing my guitar and imagine a man not a child of any revolt. It shows that The Who has come a long way since.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Though not as great as it could've been, this is still a fine film.  The story about man's struggle to survive (indeed the whole world's struggle, really) against these horrible beasts is straightforward but well-executed.  The acting is solid, perhaps a little melodramatic at times, but then again, the movie takes place in melodramitic times.  If you buy into the situation created, you can't help but understand the pressure these survivors must live with.  Melodramatic is NOT the same as over-the-top, and in fact, I found all the characters likable and easy to empathize with because they really don't know what to do except try something and hope for the best. <br /> <br />Of course, the real stars are the dragons, and they are amazing.  Truly impressive.  And perhaps the most dangerous monsters ever to be unleashed in a film.  Once you see them in action, you don't wonder how humanity ended up falling upon such hard times.  These things are that formidable.  It could be tricky to create such great monsters and still make any human resistance seem plausible, but the film does an excellent job by reminding us of the one advantage humans have always had over the rest of nature's arsenal:  Our intellect.  The final confrontation is very exciting, though just a little short. <br /> <br />That's my only complaint with the film.  The dragons just aren't in it enough.  But if they were thrown in more, it could make them seem commonplace, and even weaken their threatening appearance.  And really, they are in it quite a bit.  They're just so cool, I ended up wishing to see more of them. <br /> <br />As a fan of giant monster movies (and that's basically what this film is), I think anyone who enjoys Godzilla, The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms, or Them! will get a kick out of this movie.  Adventure fans should be pleased too.  And I think it'll age very well in the long run.
B00025ETIW|5.0|okay, first off, to ppl like eggplant and that other d00d.... <br />really, not everyone has to be hardcore, i bet you don't even know your roots, like Zeppelin and watnot....BTO and all the classics...but NEVER diss a band because you're too 'hardcore' to be listening to it....and my god, you just overall suck, why are you reviewing it if it's not any good to you, thru all of that, i heard NOTHING about THIS cd, i heard about how ppl are gay for listening to this music, ya well....haha...ur gay too, hate to break it to you :).....you're one of those ppl, who purposefully stops from tapping his feet when listening to Im not okay, i mean....just so ppl won't be like OMG! you like that stuff?!?! ...haha...i hate ppl like you, you're a self-concious twit who doesn't wanna be seen listening to good music just cuz it might make you seem uncool, kinda ironic as that's how you look.... <br /> <br />now, as for the album, gerard's vocals compliment the whole guitar/drums/etc. kinda like stapp did for creed, the whole rough voice against cruchy distortion! i LOVE this cd, not a HUGE fan of ghost of you and in the end? or something like that...and i actually like 'demolition lovers' off the old cd....it's like a harder version of 'the used'(another A+ band) who are a bit more poppier....i like it....gerard reminds me of bert ALOT, and the guitars sound like alexisonfire, this is what alexisonfire shoulda sounded like.....but no...they had to scream....:P....i love this band, also, if you've never heard Billy Talent, d/l some or buy the cd...can't go wrong with them, every single song A++...... <br /> <br />overall, good cd, worth the purchase, i dun buy many cd's...so that's saying something when i tell you it's worth buying...
B0007Y08QA|2.0|Christian Bale carries this movie through his will to play a role no actor would take based on the requirements.  It is a questionable choice however because the movie itself lacks the depth of other dark films such as Taxi Driver and Max.  Reznik, although played to perfection by Bale, is not an unforgetable character like Travis Bickle or Hitler.  I had to give it a lower rating because people have hyped this movie to 4 stars out of 5, which it is not.  It is an entertaining psychological thriller.  The movie is very much about guilt and how it can tear someone up inside and make em crazy.     <br /> <br />Overall, it is a fun movie to watch, but do not expect the greatest psychological thriller ever.
043401155X|5.0|The author calls language an \\"uninvented invention\\". This very engaging book is an attempt to uncover at least some of the secrets of language and to dismantle the stated paradox. By drawing on recent discoveries in linguistics, Deutscher explores the elusive forces of creation, change and the innate structure of language. In addition, he investigates the way that the elaborate conventions of communication develop in human society. This cultural evolution means the emergence of behavioural codes that are passed on from generation to generation.<br /><br />Chapter One: Castles In The Air, takes a close look at the structure of language, whilst the following chapter: Perpetual Motion, demonstrates linguistic development and change with particular reference to English, German, French and the Indo-European language family as a whole. Chapter Three: Forces Of Destruction, is a further investigation of how and why changes in sound and meaning take place, with many examples from Indo-European. Chapter Four examines interesting verbs like \\"To have/to hold\\" and the concepts of space and time in linguistic expression.<br /><br />Chapter Five: Forces Of Creation, is a discussion of how new words and structures arise, how meanings change and how languages are enriched by these developments. Chapter Six looks at the need for order in languages and contains lots of interesting information on the Semitic family and its intricate verbal system. In essence, the effects of erosion interact with the mind's craving for order. There is thus a constant search for regular patterns and spontaneous analogical innovations arise. This is based on erosion + expressiveness and erosion + analogy.<br /><br />The final chapter brings it all together and includes detailed discussions of possessives, quantifiers, plural markers, articles and the various interactions of verbs and nouns. This highly entertaining read is accessible to the non-linguist and explains many fascinating features of language and its structure. There are five appendices, copious notes, a bibliography and glossary of terms. The book concludes with an index.<br /><br />I also recommend On The Origin Of Languages by Merritt Ruhlen, How To Kill A Dragon by Calvert Watkins, and the work of that great pioneer of language classification, Professor Joseph Greenberg.here are five appendices, copious notes, a bibliography and glossary of terms.

B00006AFUR|5.0|I've fallen in love with this band. For those hesitating to buy it, you won't be disappointed. The band is great, the lyrics are great, everything is great. <br /> <br />My favs on the album are Edge of the Earth, Fallen, Buddha for Mary, The Mission and Echelon. Enjoy!
1400032717|4.0|Haddon does a great job of putting you into the head of an autistic child. The simple thought process he describes proves his research of the subject.  The story in itself is predictable, but still enjoyable.  Great for a Sunday on the beach...
B0000025GW|4.0|Slow Train Comming is one of Bob Dylan's 3 Christian/Gospel era recordings.  Even though I am not of Christian faith, I can truly appreciate Dylan's soul searching lyrics.  I Believe In You, Serve Somebody, When You Gonna Wake Up, and most of the others are quite touching especially with Dylan's delivery.  As a matter Dylans vocal performance is near the best of his career.<br /><br />Slow Train Comming stands strong as compared to Saved in its diverse musical arrangements.  Some songs are fast paced and others slow.  Some are more keyboard driven and others feature Mark Knophler's fine guitar playing.<br /><br />Overall this is recording is a true winner.
B000001F26|5.0|Eric Clapton has made many songs, with many bands. But if you want a good taste of what he's done this is the CD for you. \\"Laya\\" in my opinion is the highlight of this CD just because I can't ever listen to that song enough. Cocaine is great too. But there's a lot behind \\"Layla\\". During that time Eric was in love with Pattie Boyd, his friend, George Harrison's wife. That song is a Rock and Roll love song. It doesn't have many lyrics but only because it doesn't need them.  <br />Along with this great song you get some good cover songs including \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" and \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\". Both of those beautifully done. \\"Let it Grow\\" is a feel-good tune. A nice little acoustic clapton song. Every sing on here is worth whatever amount of money you have to pay. Every Clapton fan needs this. Unless you have all the CD's that have these songs on them.
6305181772|4.0|Less an homage to the classic show, \\"Mission: Impossible\\" is more like an homage to cold-war thrillers in general, with international travel, intrigue in European cities and some high-tension excitement inspired by the classic hesit movie \\"Topkapi\\".  MI stars Cruise as Ethan Hunt, the front man of the \\"Impossible Mission Force\\" (which coincidentally shares its initials with \\"International Monetary Fund - interesting coincidence).   <br /> <br />The flick begins in Prague with a mission to nab a turncoat who steals an index of secret agents across the world - the NOC list.  At first everything works like clockwork - then it goes wrong.  Hunt finds himself on the run as his fellow agents die.  Soon, he's the sole survivor, and the disk is missing.  Unable to return home (his superiors think he's the turncoat) Hunt goes after the disk himself.  Following up on some slim clues, Hunt hooks up with a British arch-criminal played by Vanessa Redgrave who has the disk - cleverly convincing her that its \\"tainted\\" (it has a virus that causes whatever computer runs it to emit a distinctive frequency).  What Redgrave's character can't give him, is the identity of the man who gave her the disk - likely also responsible for betraying Hunt's team.  To get that, Hunt will have to steal the NOC list himself - and that will require him to hook up with the darkest agents ever to grace the IMF's \\"Disavowed-by-the-Secretary Agents\\" list\\", stage an impossible burglary of CIA HQ, and download the information directly from the CIA mainframe.  Then he must navigate his fellow thieves, including Jean Reno as a maverick assassin and pilot, Ving Rhames as a master-hacker, and Julie Delpy as the wife of Mr. Phelps. <br /> <br />This was a great flick - at times so incomprehensible you're tempted to write it off all as nonsense.  But Cruise and DePalma miraculously manage to hold your attention for the entire run.  There are so many great momemts that work with subtlety off of DePalma's high-tension direction - as if the director had done his work suspended from the ceiling by wires in some corner of the CIA.  Much better by half than its witless sequel, MI keeps from self-destructing through the end of the movie. <br /> <br />WISH I'D THOUGHT OF IT: The CIA computer room is secured by numerous devices meant to keep anybody from getting to the computer.  They've boobytrapped the walls and the floor to keep the computer safe; there are heat sensors, pressure sensors and sound sensors - everything to keep anybody from getting into the computer when the designated users locks up.  So why if the keyboard is what they're trying to protect, why ain't it boobytrapped?
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd. One of the greatest groups to come out of England. Darkside of the Moon is what most people call \\"their greatest work\\". If you've never heard a Pink Floyd song and wanna get into them, this is the one to do it on. From beginning to end it's a magical journey of what a psychedelic rock band can accomplish.  <br /> <br />This CD, unlike others on here, actually deserves five stars. The first track, \\"Speak to Me\\" and \\"Breathe\\" start the CD out in a slow mellow way. The next song moves the sound up a notch. \\"One the Run\\" has a fast moving rythym to it and with it's eerie voices makes it a good song as well. Then we have \\"Time\\" which begins with many clocks ringing and such. One of Pink Floyd's best works really. The whole band gets wrting credit on this one also. Followed by that, there is \\"Great Gig in the Sky\\". The way that piano and those vocals go together is just beautiful. \\"Money\\" follows this song and it's a good one as well. It's catchy lyrics and cool bass riff make it another one of the band's big hits. Track 6, which is \\"Us and Them\\", is where Dick Parry really shines on that saxophone. The beautifully, haunting lyrics make this an excellent song as well. After that, comes \\" Any Colour You Like\\" and I'll admit it's not one of my personal favorites. It's entirely instrumental and just a little to \\"out there\\" for my taste. Ending the CD are \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\" which are usually just considered one song by most people. Water's lyrics make these last two a great ending to a great CD. And, at the very end, there's a nice little message reminding all of us who don't know that much about astronomy that \\"There's no Darkside of the Moon really. Matter of fact, it's all dark.\\" <br />
0060589272|5.0|Great book, interesting studies of sacred and profane <br />sexuality. I just read another text, \\"The Little Book <br />of He and She\\", which describes in an even more graphic <br />way the total effect of the emotions, both physical and <br />spiritual, that can come to exist between a man and a woman. <br />But this book deserves five stars.
B000024D4R|4.0|As my title says, \\"I bought animals because it was kinda cheap\\" and this is very true. I was in Best Buy and I found this CD for only 10.00 which compared to the Wal*Mart price of $15 something seemed pretty good. So I bought it. I'd never heard of any of the songs before and when I purchased it, I only had \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Darkside of the Moon\\" in my collection. The first and last songs, being exactly the same but with different lyrics create a nice little beginning and a equally nice end. So let me start be talking about \\"Dogs\\" I've only listened to it a few times since 17 minutes is a length of time I don't usually have to spend on a song. I hated it at first. But after listening to it a few more times, I started to like it. \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" is ok but \\"Sheep\\", I just can't really say that much about. I'm not sure how that one made it onto \\"Echoes\\" instead of \\"Dogs\\".  <br /> <br />Pink Floyd's interesting look at the book \\"Animal Farm\\" is not for everyone. I suggest it only if your seriously into this band. Just remember, if it wasn't for this album, The Wall may have never existed.
B00005R8GU|5.0|Every once in a while an artist puts out a recording that transcends it's genre. This is one of those. If you have to own one blues album this is it. When people say I don't get jazz I turn them on to Kind Of Blue by Miles, Somethin' Else by Cannonball Adderley or Take Five by Dave Brubeck because these albums transcend their  musical catagory and enlighten people. <br />When someone says to me I don't get the blues I turn them on to Stone Crazy by Buddy Guy Johnny Winter by Johnny Winter but this album is always the first album I suggest. Also having just bought the extended edition I can tell you the 3 extra songs are absolutely great. \\"Country Boy\\" is my favorite song on this Cd. If you like this then also pick up the extended version Cd of Muddy \\"Mississippi\\" Waters another live set. It contains a whole Cd of new material that is not filler trust me.This music sounds as fresh today as when i used to listen to it in High School. Buy it,don't ask questions and enjoy.
B0006399FS|1.0|Here is what happens when a good band writes a bad record.  Marketing takes over music.  It happens to the best of them.  Let's hope that this is a blip in the system and not the new trend.  The Rolling Stones have done marketing over music for years.  People sadly think they are the greatest rock band in the world.  In reality the Stones are just one band from a long gone era doing greatest hits shows and tricking record labels into giving them large sums of money for the new turds they call albums.  U2 can very eaisly fall into that trap.  Look no further than the IPOD commercial that turned Bono into iBONO...  Better luck next time guys.
0385335482|5.0|My favorite book of all the shopaholic series, very funny and clever. Reminds me of Bridget Jones dairy, but funnier! <br />Cant wait for her next book, The Undomestic Goddess.
B0001AP12G|5.0|\\"The College Dropout\\" is easily one of the best albums I've ever heard. \\"Jesus Walks\\" was a stand-out song for me months before radio and television gave it any airplay. Kanye in ways reminds me of 2Pac, speaking for the people, saying what we talk about on street corners and in barbershops everyday. \\"Never Let Me Down\\" is also a standout track in which the great Jay-Z delivers two of the best verses of his career. \\"The College Dropout\\" gives me some hope for hip-hop, getting away from the complacency of bling, money, and drugs in the genre. Can't wait for \\"Late Registration\\"...
B0007TKNIS|4.0|Seeing the Broadway for the second time only a short time after seeing the movie in the theater I can say the movie and the stage production have their differences. The avid theater musical lover will be distracted by the performance of the phantom. His vocal musical quality leaves something to be desired. Also be prepared for a few changed and all together new scenes including a sword fight. The acting and cinemitography are compelling and amazing. Very impressive and simple to fallow in comparison of the stage production which can leave you lost at times. The interpretation and transition for the character of the phantom from a charming luring individual to pure insanity is a bit of a change for me. All in all I found the film to be a good (not great) adaptation of the classic musical.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I had heard good reviews about the movie but didnt know what to expect.  <br />The movie starts out very \\"dark\\" the cinematography is dimly lit and sort of dirty. I didnt think I was going to like the movie. It was also confusing at the beginning. Then it clicked and I was able to understand what was going on. It was such a neat idea. I've watched the movie 3 times since and have gotten different things from it each time. It doesnt get old.  <br />A great movie. I loved it.
0783226845|2.0|Charlie (Chris O'Donnell), a prep school student on a scholarship, takes a weekend job supervising the blind former army officer Frank Slade (Al Pacino).  Frank unexpectedly takes Charlie on a luxurious trip to New York, where Frank plans to sample the best that life has to offer before taking his own life.  Charlie, meanwhile, is struggling with the morality of whether to inform on some fellow classmates whom he witnessed setting up a practical joke to humiliate the headmaster of the school (James Rebhorn).   <br /> <br />After some truly great performances, it's a shame that this is the film that finally won Pacino his Oscar.  He's effective, as always, but the majority of his performance is over-the-top bluster and shouting of the type that has become almost stereotypical for him.  The screenplay (by Bo Goldman) is strictly formulaic; once it creaks into motion, there is never any doubt about where it is headed.  Along the way, we are treated to ridiculous scenes such as a blind tango and a test drive in a Porsche with the blind Slade hurtling through the streets of New York at 90 mph without encountering pedestrians, other traffic, or drifting off the road.  He even makes some hairpin turns! <br /> <br />The film is also morally confused.  The great dilemma in Charlie's life is whether to become a snitch.  The filmmakers seem to take the position that informing on another is always wrong, no matter how illegal, harmful, or stupid the incident concerned.  Goldman goes to great pains to present headmaster Trask as a dislikeable man so that he will lose audience sympathy.  But that doesn't make him wrong.  Charlie's classmates perpetrated a stupid prank with the sole intention of putting down another person.  Add to this the fact they are perfectly satisfied to sit back in silence to let Charlie take the fall for something he didn't do, and I am at a loss as to why Charlie should be expected to feel any loyalty toward them at all.  The prestigious Baird School willno doubt produce the type of leaders that we have had too many of in the past, men who will stonewall press and public to protect their cronies from facing the consequences of their misdeeds. <br />
B00080ZG10|1.0|Scorsese's best film was LAST TEMPTATION, and nearly everything else that doesn't have Robert DeNiro in it stinks. THis is so dull, only someone from Bryn Mawr would applaud it. Speaking of which, Blanchett's portrayal of Hepburn is cliched. She wears pants, she smokes, she plays golf, her family is brahmin (sounds like every girl that ever went to Bryn Mawr), but there's no insight into what Kate was like. That's not necessarily Blanchett's fault as apparently Hepburn in her autobiography had no insight either. <br />Di Caprio is another stuffed shirt. He couldn't act his way out of a grade school chorus. He kinda looks like Hughes, but he is as convincing as nothing more than someone who got the haircut right and some of the twitches down. It's hard to believe this film was nominated for anything other than the dust bin. The dialogue is pedantic at times, preposterous at others, and has enough gee-whiz in it to make it sound like a bad Mickey Rooney film. <br />Looks nice though. I fell asleep three times trying to get through it. Maybe it's just that it's hard for the rest of us to emotionally invest in the life of HH. Like were they tro make a film about Gates, 1. would anybody care; 2. how good could it ever hope to be? Same problem here. Maybe if they had Depp play Hughes and DiCaprio play Willie Wonka, both films might come out better. But to suggest that DiCaprio be considered a best actor in the same breath as Freeman or Eastwood is the kind of blasphemy that JC himself would find an irresistable temptation to condemn. <br />I couldn't possibly comment on the extras, as I've thrown the movie away.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I was never uncertain of Burton's capability to pull together this movie. The book's satirical and playful twisted ness fits right into Burton's M.O (BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and SLEEPY HOLLOW are some of my favorite movies) It is quite evident that Burton had a vision is his mind for this film and for the most part he delivers a fun and satisfying film that serves for vast escapism, even though we have seen most of the content previous to in the original. While we've heard the story before and know exactly what happens to each character, it is still fun to get a tour of Wonka's factory through Burton's vision. The set crew has crafted some visually astounding sets from the Bucket's home to the colorful factory. Scenes that we will recall from the original, such as the boat ride, are more fun and exciting to watch. The original was very somber, but here things are pretty fast paced.<br /><br />With the exception of Depp playing Wonka, all the actors/actresses are duplicating the roles of the characters in the original. Each child plays up their signature bad character trait and Freddie Highmore is perfect as Charlie. Helena Bonham Carter is always a delight in Burton's films and does well here as Charlie's mother. It is Depp's performance that is significantly dissimilar from his counterpart. I believe Depp to be one of the most excellent character actors in Hollywood at this time. He adapts well and commits to his characters. Depp opted to go for the same sarcastic oddity we found with Wilder's Wonka, and his performance was excellent. Danny Elfman's fantastic musical score drives the film in a way that makes every musical scene even more magical. Conceivably an even more perfect team than Depp and Burton is Elfman and Burton, bouncing personalities off each other to create a brilliant mix of offbeat charm that never fails to amuse.<br /><br />Thankfully, the lamentful singing is replaced by the eccentric Oompa Loompa musical numbers. Each number is different and completely funny to watch. Lastly, what is also fun about this film is that you can see glimpses of Burton's other films on display here. The opening credits, which consist of a tour through Wonka's odd chocolate bar assembly line, reminded me a lot of the cookie maker machine in EDWARD SCISSORHANDS. Also, the Bucket's house looks like it was straightforwardly lifted out of BIG FISH with its odd slant. Just a few things Burton added in to bring together his style. In the end, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY'S plot is reused from the original, but what else did you expect. A few things have been changed to follow more closely to the book. The film is fun, colorful and entertaining. Already pulling in the punters, Willy Wonka is sure to be one of the biggest films of this year.nny to watch.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV and no one knows it. and season 2 is not bad! just because season 1 was more of a soap opera and season 2 is a more mature charecter driven season does not mean it is bad! just because little stupid teens cannot sit on front of a TV and watch charecters grow and evolve and not constantly keep taking their clothes off and and living wildly (even though a lot of the supporting charecters do that, the main ones are a lot more mature, well in some ways! :) ) But what is so amazing with this show is that it achieves a brillent level of high drama and screwball comedy. The O.C. is probably one of the wittiest and most heartfelt shows on TV and still no one knows it. Not even the teens who watch it know it! I hate how this wonderful show is getting trashed but stupid people who can't handle matureity.
B00005JNQA|3.0|Sydney Pollack presents us with a political thriller that is reminiscent of his films that he has graced us with in the past and which all shared one common thread. The personal struggle that leads to the catharsis whether or not the resolution (catharsis) of the political situation is achieved. <br /> <br />The film involves an assassination plot of a African country leader that is accidentally overheard by Silvia Broome, a U.N. interpreter portrayed by Nicole Kidman and the investigation that is carried by Tobin Keller, a Secret Service agent portrayed by Sean Penn. <br /> <br />Personal issues are uncovered throughout the process of the investigation hence the plot pleasantly thickens to a believable level without going overboard. Any, few to mention, predictable outcomes, are overshadowed by the lead performances that convey under toned emotions and maturely balanced issues; issues that would be too vague if one had to carry within and too melodramatic if one had to extend through outbursts of speaking their minds out loud. <br /> <br />Take note of the performances that are carried many times through facial expressions when any single word would be considered overacting. <br /> <br />One point that becomes a fashion in most of the Sydney Pollack films is that even though there is a resolution of personal issues, the people involved, the two lead characters separate their ways, either for \\"good\\" or for a \\"good period\\" of time.  <br /> <br />In the first case the viewer is left at the end with the notion that there is no possibility that the two characters will cross paths. In the latter case the viewer is left at the end of the film with the notion that some further psychological mending needs to take place and then the two characters may take it from there. <br />

B00005YTN5|5.0|After buying the lp, the first cd and the box set, I've been hard pressed at justifying this purchase.  I spotted a used copy at the local swap shop; the guy at the counter asked (in so many words) \\"Is this really going to improve your love life?\\"  No, and it won't get me into a band with Brian Eno either. <br /> <br />But I've always found the standard release of this classic album pretty brittle on the sonic side, especially on Nico's numbers.  So when I read that there was an \\"original mono\\" version of the disc, I've really been curious as to whether this would be any significant improvement. <br /> <br />It is.  Nothing is ever going to turn the original primitive tapes into ECM ambiance, but it is also clear that Tom Wilson's stereo re-mix was enough to edge lo-fi into no-fi back when.  Besides some noticable reduction of distortion, the guitars are now front and center, while the vocals sound stronger. <br /> <br />Is it worth the extra purchase?  Hard to say.  It would be nice if the mono version was available as a single disc, or part of the box set.  If you are a hard core VU fan you should try to hear this version sometime.
B00006D295|5.0|This movie is very funny, very weird, and so much fun! The songs in this movie are great! Tim Curry plays an outstanding  <br />Frank Furter, and Barry Bostwick and Susan Sarandon play Brad and Janet perfectly! This is a great movie!

B000088E6D|5.0|Paige and Frank- <br /> <br />I understand your views completely. For true Sinatra fanatics, Buble may or may not be for you. And that's okay. But I have heard Sinatra. I have a number of his CDs. And since I discovered Buble, my Sinatra CDs now sit tucked away in a box. (Sorry Blue Eyes.) While Sinatra was great, Buble puts an addictive twist on these songs that makes me want to listen to them over and over again. I don't think Frank would mind. <br /> <br />I just saw Buble in concert and it was crazy fun. Besides his overwhelming charm and wit, I adored his music (yes, his music). He sang his own songs from a newer album and almost brought the audience to tears. He also sang his last song without a microphone or his band. It was amazing. <br /> <br />Michael Buble isn't stealing Sinatra's music. He's helping a whole new generation of listeners appreciate those songs. And he's creating his own music at the same time. I can't think of a performer who hasn't sung another artist's songs at some point. Sinatra's estate is getting well paid, I'm sure. The only thing Buble is doing is keeping Frank's songs alive.
0790749815|5.0|Common language philosophers talk about \\"operant definitions\\" in that something is as it operates. While on the outset I never thought of North by Northwest earth-shattering by any means, it must be one of my favorites as I have seen it more often than any other movie I can think of, barring my known favorite - Being There. <br /> <br />Since the movie really snuck up on me as one of my all time favorites it is hard to say just what I like about it. It is a fast paced thriller, sure, but so are many other movies that don't qualify. It is alternatively funny, thrilling, suspenseful, and has good acting and, of course, excellent directing and artful cinematography. <br /> <br />Maybe it's all in a nutshell. The period of Hitchcock from Rope to N by NW all have worlds I'd like to live in, despite whatever \\"bad\\" thing is going on. I would just love to be in any one of the worlds created, the coloring, the pacing, the people - I'd love to be ROT, subtracting the spies. I'd love to live in the house on the cliff side, I'd love to \\"ride the train\\" with Eva Marie Saint. Similarly I'd love to be independently wealthy and living in the penthouse in Rope, or the curious tableau created for Rear Window, or on the Riviera in To Catch a Thief. <br /> <br />So I get drawn in every time. To be witty and urbane and bag hot babes is paid for with some spies and more spies. Hmmmmmm....maybe it is an even trade....
1581804849|5.0|This is my favorite One Stroke book thus far.  However, I had already purchased her video \\"flowers for all seasons\\" and the \\"one stroke painting course\\" and \\"easy murals\\" books, so I had a feel for the basics.  Her books tend to have some of the same information in each (which I find annoying), but \\"flowers A to Z\\" has a lot of variety, so you can learn a lot of techniques just by going through and trying the different flowers. I disagree with the reviewer who claimed the pictures are of poor quality...they look fine to me.  Overall, I think this book is a good value.
0316172324|1.0|What a load of tripe. I quickly figured out that this book isn't worth the money and made a snap decision not to buy it. Come on now, don't be gullible and think.
B00008OWZC|3.0|When judging live releases, one must not be jaded by the material the band is performing or their status as legends. Simply put, this album is not worth the 30 dollars you are planning on shelling out. Disc 1 is fine. It has energetic, though sloppy, performances of their relatively shorter classics. It's OK, but the band never really improves the songs the way the Who or the Stones do. They don't really add anything. Disc 2 is just a disaster. Dazed and Confused goes on for an interminable amount of time. This would be OK if Zeppelin were half the jammers that the Grateful Dead or the Allman Brothers were. But they're not. As an album review site pointed out, notice how quite a few of the sections of Dazed (supposedly, you know, a 'jam song', meaning it's supposed to include some improv) match up exactly with sections on the Song Remains the Same version, which was recorded the next year. It's no fluke, either...he was pulling out the same 'James Brown' and 'punk rock' and 'horribly disgusting violin-bow' sections throughout the Seventies. If you've never heard it before, it's neat, but getting more of the same makes me feel kinda like a chump. What is and What Should Never Be and Dancing Days are decent, the latter actually being an immense improvement upon the horrible studio version. Moby Dick is far and away the worst \\"song\\" on here. Awesome riff wasted on an 18 minute drum solo. 18 MINUTES. Does ANYBODY want to listen to that? There is no melody! Just 18 minutes of pouding! Skip it. Disc 3 starts off with a longer, if somewhat overlong and generic Whole Lotta Love/Blues Medley. The Ocean, Rock n Roll, and Bring it on Home are just like the Disc 1 songs. Energetic, but aren't anything you haven't heard done better before.  <br />Robert Plant is consistently subpar throughout the set. Some songs he can coast along with average performances, but he just ruins others with his \\"BABY, BABY, BABY\\" outbursts. If you want a great live performance of his, check out BBCsessions. And once again, John Paul Jones' bass is criminally buried in the mix.  <br />I know that many of you who started reading this review haven't finished it because you are die hard Zepheads who won't hear a discouraging word uttered against your gods. But for those of you who honestly want a thorough, objective review, save your money. This isn't even the best live Zep money can buy. Their BBC and Albert Hall performances trump this one. Don't shell out $30 for a disc and a half of good performances and a whole lotta generic blues wanking/drum soloing. Buy it used or get it from the library first.
0060234814|4.0|I read this in three days.  The fastest I've ever read a book I think.  Of course, I didn't have much else to do though, so that might be a factor.<br /><br />Still, the book was very enjoyable, especially since I'm not into all of this mythological stuff.  I especially like the lamp-post at the end of the world concept.<br /><br />This book is very descriptive, which I guess is an essential element to the success of a book.  It gives you a sense that the author is actually there and just reporting what happens.  He mentions everything, even how one of the kids during a long journey watches a beaver's feet plod along through the snow, as if in a trance.  Minor details like that seem to confirm the author was really there.  Great for fiction.  I think the Harry Potter books are like that too.<br /><br />I hope this isn't a spoiler, but this book has Santa Claus in it, which I personally thought was kind of lame, but oh well.<br /><br />This isn't my favorite book ever, but it's fun to read.  I don't think I'll get the other Narnia books, but I've got nothing against them.  They're good stuff.  I only got this book because I recognized the book cover.  I believe I saw it when I was a little kid.  These books must have been popular for the past 50 years.  I think Mel Gibson is due to make this particular book into a movie this Christmas, but I'm not sure.<br /><br />I used to think books were always better than movies, because seeing a movie every week cost a lot more than reading books for a hobby.  Now I'm not so sure.  This one cost me seven bucks, and I finished it in less than a week.  Now I think good books are good, and good movies are good, but neither books or movies are better overall.<br /><br />I've noticed that my reviews have been getting poor ratings as of late, so I don't think I'll write as many now.  I'll have to find something more productive.  Like reading Alice's Adventures in Wonderland again.  That's a great book to read by the way.  Buy it with its sequel.Buy it with its sequel.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Honestly, when the show was on tv my husband would watch faithfully but I never did have an interest.  The only thing he wanted for his birthday was this dvd so and it just happened to come out on his special day so I bought it.  In an effort to \\"bond\\" I started to watch the dvd's with my husband and.... <br /> <br />I'M HOOKED!  What an incredible series!  The characters have depth and you can really empathize with them. The storylines are original and well thought out.  This is such a refreshing change from all of the other crap that is out on tv. <br /> <br />I can't wait for the movie to come out and I wish FOX would bring this series back!
B00003CX9E|5.0|I know I may sound \\"smarmy\\" and \\"full of myself\\", but I took great offense to your ridiculing of an art form and an industry about which a lot of people see and hear but few know and understand. Film is an art, but it is also a science. And in any science, not everything is open to personal interpretation. For the most part, summer blockbuster movies are silly and stupid. The only reason they get made is because they rake in a lot of dough for the studios. They entertain on a base level and rarely address the human condition.     What most people are not able to do when they see a movie is separate what they LIKE from what is actually GOOD. Just because you like a movie, does not make it good. \\"Terminator 2\\" is my favorite film of all time, I like it more than any other film I've seen. Do I think it is one of the greatest? ABSOLUTLEY NOT!     And as for \\"smaller, cheaper, seriously minded movies aimed at older audiences\\", they are smaller, cheaper and seriously minded because they are most often a labor of love. An artist who really had something to say (and wasn't just trying to make 500 million dollars for the studios) got his \\"smaller\\", \\"cheaper\\" film made. \\"Alien\\" is your favorite movie...not the greatest! The reason why most people find \\"smaller\\" films boring is because they do not know how to read cinematically! Film is a visual language, and if you cannot speak a language, chances are you can't understand it. CASE AND POINT:  I'm not a mathematician. I can't read math. Some one drawing on a chalkboard explaining theories of quantum physics is likely to bore me. Catch my drift?    Lastly, movies are not just entertainment. They are a means of self-expression. If they can entertain you, that's good. I think it shows a great deal of \\"self-centeredness\\" when we can't look beyond our own desire for pleasure and comfort to recognize what others are trying to say. In your lambasting of movie critics and of this particular film, you may have inadvertently made yourself appear \\"smarmy\\", \\"cynical\\", \\"conceited\\", and \\"full of yourself\\". I don't think you are and would like your feedback.(...)  PS: Orson Welles' radio program was not meant as a prank. It was supposed to be like a TV movie, or in this case, a one-time-only dramatic radio program. The problem was that most people tuned in late and thought it was a news bulletin!
B000068FTS|5.0|This is an amazing album, to compare to sting is just ignorant...I'll admit that I didn't like it at first, it had too much ambient noise; however, after hearing it a little more in conjunction with other wilco albums and other music that is currently being released it is an album that makes you appreciate wilco for being one of the first bands in a long time that actually develops with each album. Unlike every band on a clear channel communication station or MTV, this band actually tries to change instead of sticking with what makes money. As for the themes in the album, there songs and meanings in there that fit the times and can be discussed or listened to several times and only gain significance.
0140277447|5.0|The \\"thin veneer of humanity\\", actually I do not have the book handy, so I really do not re-call her quote. Was Iris killed by the Japanese? Anyway, does it really surprise anyone that this occurred? Many people know deep down, what percentage who knows, if things got really ugly, that you can not trust anyone. That maybe your friend, neighbor, brother, sister, co-worker, will stab you right in the heart, for that last morsel. We do it everyday, in more subtle \\"accecptable\\" ways. So, it is ridiculous to believe that it did not happen, even if the numbers are lower, or even if it did not happen in Nanking, we all know it happen in other places, at other times. And if you do not know that, you are either an idiot, or someone who would fit right nicely into the Japanese army and government. Anyway, humans are animals, as such, our greatest instinct is to survive. Most people naturally do what their leaders tell them to do, because they instinctively know this will help them survive. This is why many follow President Bush today. In other words, people instinctively know what side their bread is buttered on. This is why people follow monarchies. Here, I define monarchies as governments, where most of the people in government spend more time doing their own bidding, and not the peoples. The people who deny this are simply reacting to survival instincts, follow the leader. It is not a question of will this happen again, but when. This may not be clear, but I hope people get the point.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I waited for the release of this movie with mixed feelings as I adore the first one...however I could think of NO ONE better suited to the role of Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp, and still can't!  His performance was BRILLIANT and FABULOUS!!  He in NO WAY compares to Michael Jackson!!  I mean REALLY...where ever DO people come up with such idiocy!  I thought the other actors were fun and really good in their roles, and the music?  Oh my GOODNESS; it was GREAT!!!  It was FUNNY!!  Thank you Mr. Elfman!!!  See this movie!!  You will NOT be disappointed whether a fan of the old or just a fan of the story!!
B0000542D2|2.0|Since I originally saw this movie in the theater in 1964 and really dug it, I regretfully have to agree with Pete and David's reviews.   Whatever was done to this movie on DVD took away the quality of the original.  Perhaps this is the reason that you don't see interviews with any of the Beatles.  The interviews that are on the second disc are very much meaningless and don't add to the flavor of the movie.  It was cut badly in places that were not cut in the original, and I don't understand what was done with the soundtrack.  In a single word the soundtrack is \\"CRAPPY\\"!  Perhaps if the entire movie would have been redubbed in Dolby 5.1 surround sound, it might have been better.  This issue on DVD is not gear!  So please, give us back the original and add the trailers.

And OK Computer is so beyond anyone has done that the nay-sayers and clones still have to try and reproduce the sound, they can't quite \\"put there finger on it\\"...but that's just it, radiohead isn't calssified, they are so genre-less, every song can create and fit into it's own genre, that's how diverse theye are, that's how they choose to break there mold time and time again with every new track. OK Computer is so righ in variety, in incongruent beauty...in melodic chaos that yorkes voice creates. The blips and beeps that come out of nowhere to transport you to other realms....it's amazing the level of trance and inspiration these guys instill.....nothing alse like it. nobody, and I mean nobody around right now can compare, not Muse, Coldplay, travis or anyother cold hearted wannabe copy of a copy...OK Computer, buy it..listen to it...let it seep into your life...it's more then music, Radiohead is more then a band, they've become part of Life itself..they stand for something more then a mere band. prophets,masters, gods..they rule the sound waves...and they do it for no one but the music itself...
0345440900|1.0|I was given this book before the birth of my daughter, and dutifully read her descriptions of personality types, etc.  Ms. Hogg attempts to present herself as the reasonable \\"medium\\" in a sea of extremes in baby care advice books.  However, don't be fooled.  Her descriptions and techniques are just as rigid as any out there; she just disguises them well by applying them differently to her subgroups of children and throwing in what she must think are charming 'British-isms,' which I frankly found irritating and distracting. <br />So, at best, it's not worth your money.  At worst, however, it can be very detrimental to the honest efforts of those mothers who want to give their babies the best nutrition possible:  Breastmilk.  The schedules she describes, and her appeasing of those moms who want to give up breastfeeding because they don't want flabby breasts and \\"shouldn't be ashamed of it,\\" do nothing but undermine the efforts of these moms in what is a beautiful but sometimes difficult process.  Though she says that formula is \\"chock full of good things,\\" here's the reality and the science:  it is NOT as good as breastmilk.  The epidemic of childhood, obesity, asthma, allergies, ear infections, etc., should be obvious enough to someone who calls herself a lactation consultant.  The scheduling she describes can and does cause women to decrease their milk supply, thereby creating reliance on formula. <br /> <br />And finally, seasoned mothers will know that, despite what \\"her nan\\" says, carrying a 2 month old baby who you soothe to sleep does not mean you're going to be carrying a 25 pound old toddler around.   <br /> <br />I too once believed that children should be encouraged to be independent at a very early age, often heralded by their ability to sleep alone on a parent's schedule.  Then I got 13 years of experience working with babies and their families, and quickly learned that 1) babies are not built to be independent and it's ludicrous and harmful to your relationship to think they should be, and 2) the most independent and courageous children, who can be alone and happy later, are those who had parents who Ms Hogg would find too nurturing, too placating, etc.   <br /> <br />The research is out there: babies who are responded to when they need it have improved brain development in the first 6 months, compared to children who are not.  Rocking a newborn to sleep doesn't cause needy toddlers. Feeding on demand is the best, most consistently effective way to ensure adequate nutrition in babies, because they are hardwired to get the amount of breastmilk they need.  That's how humans are built, and it's a beautiful thing.  Too bad Ms. Hogg didn't do her own research before doling out unhelpful, and frankly harmful, advice to parents obviously in need of help.
B0007P3582|5.0|It came of no surprise to me when i pressed play on this CD. I do not buy a lot of CD's but i knew this would not disappoint me. Maybe the weakest song on this album is 'This Is 50' or 'God Gave me Style', the rest definitely make up for it. At first 'I'm Supposed to Die Tonight', 'Piggy Bank', 'Gatman & Robbin' and 'Outta Control' stood out because they have catchy beats but i soon realised that 'ski mask way' and other similar songs also are very good tracks. I personally dislike Fat Joe and 50 would clean him up in a rap battle, also because 50 has been rapping for quite a long time now. I think the Intro was done very well and fits in nicely with the album.  <br /> <br />Ratings:       ( /10) <br /> <br />Track 1 - Very solid intro (no rating) <br /> <br />Track 2 - Great song, good beat, good song to begin with (9/10) <br /> <br />Track 3 - Not really a stand-out but alright beat and chorus is quite well done. (6/10) <br /> <br />Track 4 - This track is very catchy and has a nice flowy beat. Good rapping. (9/10) <br /> <br />Track 5 - Awesome beat, flows in well with 50's raps. Very nicely done dissing Fat Joe, Jadakiss, etc. (9.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 6 - Average on 50's behalf and not great on Em's behalf although somehow it makes a great song. Fast and catchy (8.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 7 - Beat is very good on this track (one of Dre's), i think it was good that it sounded like Magic Stick yet it is still so different. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 8 - Probably best song. This didn't instantly catch my attention but the rap ties in very swiftly with the beat. Good on Dre's behalf once again. Good rap by 50. (10/10) <br /> <br />Track 9 - Great song, good concept and rapping done very well. (8.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 10 - Did not really like this song, extremely average. (6.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 11 - Although reasonably slow still a great chorus and rapping. (8/10) <br /> <br />Track 12 - This track is one of the best 'slowish' songs. Very good chorus. (7.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 13 - I was surprised how this was fast and did not catch my attention majorly but nevertheless great song. (8/10) <br /> <br />Track 14 - Glad this one came out on radio, love the rapping in this. (10/10) <br /> <br />Track 15 - Love the rapping in this, wicked chorus as well (9.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 16 - I luuurvd this song, great idea with Tony Yayo being a toy soldier, I'm glad Yayo was on this album. Love the fast beat. (10/10) <br /> <br />Track 17 - A bit higher than average song, nice chorus but beats are once again average. (7.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 18 - An OK song, but extremely average again, good on 50's behalf (7.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 19 - I really dislike this song, i don't mind the rapping but the song as a whole is a let-down. (4.5/10) <br /> <br />Track 20 - Average, Slow ones let 50 down on this album (5/10) <br /> <br />Track 21 - Did not grab my ears at first but now i find it is a great song. (9/10) <br /> <br />Track 22 - I knew this would be a great song before i listened to it. Very good job by all of G-Unit, Young Buck did very well as he only raps for about 30 seconds or so. I'm happy this was on here. (Easy 10/10)
B000001TVD|2.0|The guitar parts on the instrumental 'Maggot Brain' are overrated, i found personally this track boring ; in the overall picture, this is not a totally bad album, there is a couple of good songs, but this is in no way a masterpiece; i bought this album after having read some very positive reviews on amazon here, so my expectations about the quality of the music were high, i must admit i have been disappointed.
B00005JNSK|5.0|Forget Gene Wilder. Forget Jack Albertson. Forget Michael Jackson. <br /> <br />Just go to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory with NO preconceptions -- and no \\"baggage\\" -- and you will have a wonderful time.  The direction, the music, the acting (everyone), all facets of the production were great fun and very entertaining. <br /> <br />Before I saw the film, I had read every critique and interview I could find and the ONLY valid (in my mind) criticism I found was that the music during the Oompah-Loompas (sp?) songs was a little too loud to hear the words. <br /> <br />So to reiterate: Go to this movie to enjoy THIS movie -- NOT the movie others would have you see.
1401301363|1.0|I was enjoying this book until I reached page 176 and read the foreword to the Haroset recipe: \\"I suppose it's as well to start with the premise that there is no such thing as Jewish food.  This of course begets the wider political assertion that there is no such thing as a Jewish race.  Faith is not the decider, and culturally, geographically, physically, Jews are too dispersed and just too different to be contained within any one definition.  But perhaps it's simpler to stick with the eating...\\"  I could not continue reading after I read this passage.

B000002UA2|5.0|Ten good selections by one of my all-time favorite bands.<br /><br />I don't know why, but for some reason, I think of Summer when I hear this; bright sunny days, warm nights, all the good things.The opener, the title track, has a sound that seems to fly through the stratosphere, parting the clouds. You almost feel airborne while listening. And it keeps up the high quality throughout, with melodic ballads  (\\"Burning Bridges\\", \\"Wot's The Deal,\\" \\"Stay\\"), harder edged rock (The Gold, is in the...\\", \\"Childhood's End\\"), the emotional instrumental \\"Mudmen,\\" and a lot of folks don't agree, but \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" is absolutely beautiful. The second half is a little strange, the tribal voices just go on, but diametrically opposed parts make interesting listening. Two examples of this working elsewhere, would be Fleetwood Mac's \\"Oh, Well,\\" and \\"Mother People,\\" by The Mothers Of Invention. Parts that don't seem to belong together, sometimes do work well together, as is the case here. You hear droning keyboard chords, somber melodies, cymbal rolls, light guitar notes, the sudden release of melodic tension, and a seemingly eternal fade-out, and then these hideous voices start to sing this apparent gibberish, a little unsettling, but somehow complimentary.<br /><br />And I really do like it.
0671015206|3.0|This book is chock-full of  details that make up the lifestyle of those who succeed at accumulating wealth, as opposed to \\"earning\\" lots of money.  They are contrasted against the habits of over-consumption of those who perhaps, gross more, but clearly fail at the bottom line.<br /><br />At its best you get a clear picture of how the simple choices we make separate us between have and have-nots, although some of those specifics are quite repetitive...
B000006TRV|3.0|First, let's be clear; this is not a Pink Floyd album, per se. OK, Waters, Wright, Mason, and Gilmour performed on this, but so did many others, not as auxiliary players either, like on \\"Dark Side\\" or \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\", no the \\"extras\\" here often played in place of the Floyd. But that ties in with the concept as a whole, because one of the major themes of \\"The Wall\\" is one of alienation.<br /><br />Compare this, if you can, to other Floyd works, the better ones. The sound always had an ambiance that's missing here. One strong point in vintage Floyd, was the \\"melodic\\" vocals were done by Gilmour and Wright, and the \\"eccentric\\" vocals were done by Waters. The one exception is Nick Mason's only recorded lead vocal, that evil voice in \\"Meddle's\\" opener, \\"One Of These Days.\\" He had a few spoken parts in \\"Corporal Clegg,\\" but that was only in the background noise. He's just a drummer here, and didn't even do all the drumming, he shared it with Willie Wilson, among others. Most of the bass playing was Andy Bown, and since Rick Wright was all but out of the band at the time, most of the keyboard parts were played by Peter Wood. Most of the lead vocals are tuneless histrionic whining, for lack of a better word, by Waters, with lots of cliche'd \\"OOH, BABE\\"'s and such, it's really ear-rending. Bob Ezrin got a songwriting credit for \\"The Trial,\\" but he wrote a lot of other material, with credit appropriated by Waters, as part of Ezrin's contract. A lot of the guitar parts were provided by outside talent like Lee Ritenour, with Waters strumming acoustic guitar on parts of it, and the orchestrations were Michael Kamen's work.<br /><br />Apart from some fine guitar solos by David Gilmour, and his unmistakable voice here and there, this monstrosity doesn't even remotely resemble what so many earlier fans, like myself, have always loved about Pink Floyd records. And it's a shame, because it's obvious that a lot, and I mean A LOT of hard work went into this.<br /><br />Another misconception is the idea behind \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2.\\" A lot of the themes of \\"The Wall\\" are Waters' own sore points, with some classic misbehaviors that can be traced directly to original Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett for fright and shock value. Scaring the crap out of a pretty groupie by destroying a hotel room, the catatonic trance-like dazes, the persecution complex, are all well-documented Syd Barrett episodes, and the bitterness of losing a father to the war, a dominating mother, having your creativity ridiculed by your teacher, and marital heartbreak are all things Roger Waters dealt with in his own life, and \\"The Wall\\" is a roll-call of all the things he has to blame in life for it being as miserable as it is. Back to \\"Another Brick...\\" . The education that he claimed to not need, is the poor quality indoctrination that the schools have always churned out in place of a real education; who would be against a real education? I don't care who you are, it's a nice feeling to learn something. \\"Just another brick in the wall\\" becomes self-explanatory, and it's two-fold; No brick in a wall is any different from any other, isn't that what all schools seem to want? And this wall is also the wall that the protagonist here is building up around himself to shut everything and everyone out. \\"The Trial\\" is the equivalent to a total breakdown, facing one's own deepest fear, in this case, the human inside being exposed as vulnerable. The wall was invulnerability.<br /><br />This didn't get the full five stars from me, because it's just not a Pink Floyd record as I have come to expect, and that voice can be a little too much sometimes.ehind \\"Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2.\\" A lot of the themes of \\"The Wall\\" are Waters' own sore points, with some classic misbehaviors that can be traced directly to original Floyd guitarist Syd Barrett for fright and shock value.

B000002JS6|5.0|I remember putting this album on the record player the first time - I was around 15 at the time and had just bought this and Sabbath's Heaven and Hell.  It really was a defining moment in my life.  Having listened to both albums I immediately ran into the garage, hot wired my Dad's Harley and sped off down to the nearby liquor store where I bought a litre of bourbon, picked up a nearby hooker and made love to her whilst wheelying down the highway.....ok so I didn't do that but it made me want to!  With corrupting powers like that it had to be good and 20 years down the track I still get the same adrenalin rush I did the first time, particularly on tracks like Shoot to thrill.  Unfortunately, the lifestyle didn't catch on and I became an accountant - but hey life is full of dreams and I can only thank AC/DC for making my life's journey that little bit richer.  Sounds ridiculous but sometimes music has the ability to do that for you.  P.s.  Has anyone noticed the similarity between Brian Johnson and Andy Cap - separated at birth or what?
B00097A5HW|5.0|Before buying this CD, I looked at the reviews people left here and was a little hesitant. I decided to purchase it anyway. I am glad I did!! If you are a real fan, and loved her previous cds, than I cant understand why you cant support Shakira in her need for experimentation and versatility. If she recorded the same songs over and over we would eventually get tired of them, do you agree? I could understand if maybe some songs were good, than I wouldn't feel the need to write a review (my first). But all the songs, in their own unique way, are really pleasant and addicting. I cant stop listenening to \\"La Pared,\\" it is captivating and very passionate and powerful. I like the aucustic version better, because you get to listen to her voice without the interruption of musical instruments (other than piano.) I loved the first song, with its French sound. Her voice is especially soothing and pleasant in this one. I love dancing to \\"Las de la Intuicion\\", the chorus is especially body moving. I just can't stop dancing. \\"Obtener Un Si\\" has an old jazzy and romantic sound. Each song, however different, has an edge to it. I rarely (once in four years) buy cds. When I listen to an artist on the radio and love their songs, I decide to get their cds from the library just to see whether or not it is worth purchasing and I am always disappointed by the artist. Shakira and Matchbox 20 are the only artists who's cds I buy because they don't disappoint. Don't get me wrong, I am not so much a loyal fan as I expect the artists I love to make great music. Shakira's new CD made me very happy. I listen to a lot of spanish music, but no artist matches or comes even close to Shakira!    This cd has only 12 songs on it, including two remixes of \\"La Tortura\\" and \\"La Pared\\". But if you have Shakira's previous cds, than you know that it is typical for her to come out with 11 songs.    Also, there is a lot of influence from other artists' melody and music. That is obvious from the first song andevident throughout the cd.    Who ever wrote a review comparing Shakira to Britney (or other pop music artists who cannot even sing much less write their own lyrics or play musical instruments)should be ashamed to even think of the comparison.
B00005JNEI|1.0|One of Moore's main points is that the Bin Laden family was ushered out of the country after 9/11. Then, he goes on to treat Richard Clarke like a celebrity guest, the very man who approved the Bin Laden's to leave!    (...)Great Americans have always been those who exercize discretion for their country when also exercizing their freedoms. Just because you have the right to be a swindling jerk doesn't mean you should be celebrated or are patriotic for it. Nobody is saying Moore is un-American because he speaks. They say it becaue of what he says.    It's truly reprehensible that Moore reaps profit from a film that positions himself to be the spokesperson for the troops. Troops who, the majority of, are supportive of Bush and certainly the mission.    The Democrats would really do themselves a favor to regain some dignity and distance themselves from such characters. I recomend that, if you must watch this film, make it productive. Go down to the local library, find some documentary or better, footage of Democratic conventions from pre-Kennedy days and make a comparison. What kind of people lined those halls then and what kind now? The difference is striking.
1400031354|4.0|I really am enjoying this series so far. The stories are very simple while at the same time they read as monumentally as end of the world thrillers. It's a real achievement to tell such quiet tales while pulling the reader in and keeping them at the edge of ones seat.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about these #1 Ladies Detective Agency books is plainly how it allows for an outsider, an American, to see Africa through the eyes of one who knows and loves their land. I realized while I was reading these books so far that I have never really thought of Africa in any other light than The Gods Must Be Crazy/Colonial superiority mindset, or through the lens of the evening news. I have long thought that Africa is a never-ending series of disasters akin to one of the levels of hell. Reading such a relentlessly positive and upbeat take on Botswana will surely help change ones opinions of Africa if you have not been there like myself.<br /><br />At the same time, I have to judge this story on its merits if I am going to be fair with my review. If I were to set this tale in the States for instance, would it be as engaging? I don't think so. I would give the mysteries and stories with in this book only a couple of stars. The originality of the writing and the unique mystery protagonist along with the setting and place on the other hand deserve five stars. So head into this book not expecting Agatha Christy. Instead think of it as if you were reading `A Year in Provance' and that this other travelogue book were laced with an amusing mystery or two.<br /><br />Enjoy
B00009Z574|2.0|This WAS the worst Yes production ever made (at least at the time it was originally put out). It is preachy, political and lacks much of the genuine drive and magic of the albums that preceded it. Rick Wakeman's keyboards sound like a child's toy in timbre and in musicianship. It appears that he put very little thought or creativity into the project. Steve Howe, virtuoso guitarist seems to have relied on regurgitating chops from all of his previous works, yet in no particular order and with little finesse or taste. The album is obviously most strongly influenced by Jon Anderson's vocal and lyrical tastes, which can be far too fluffy at least for my taste, unless balanced by some good old fashioned jam - of which there is not enough here. The one small treasure from this mush is \\"Onward\\", composed by Chris Squire, and a very nice love song at that. However, even that is ruined by Steve Howe's choppy guitar work. The song is much better executed on their \\"Keys to Ascension\\" CD where Howe shines once again and plays the song with much more sensitivity, relying on a nylon string guitar and newly refined flamenco like technique. In short, I would strongly avoid this album unless you really like the Jon Anderson ethereal sound buffered only by some nice Chris Squire bass sounds. Circus of Heaven: is that Picadilly or poppycock?
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have never had the opportunity to see the Broadway production of this amazing musical and I think that is to my advantage, as so many can't seem to stop comparing the two versions.  I have, however heard the original soundtrack with Brightman and Crawford.  So on that note, I found myself completely lost in the music and vocals of this movie.  Butler is an amazing voice for the Phantom.  No, he doesn't have all the finesse of Crawford, but the emotion that pours out of him is overwhelming.  You find yourself so caught up the power of his singing (\\"Music of the Night\\" and \\"Point of No Return\\" for example) you completely forgive a barked or strained note or two.  I actually think that Crawford sounds very effeminate next to Butler -not a characteristic I would associate with the Phantom!  Emmy is also perfect.  As many have said, she sounds like a sweet, young, innocent girl.  Wonderful to listen to.  Wilson doesn't disappoint in any way either.<br /><br />As far as the actual movie is concerned, I don't think I can get enough of it.  I was totally blown away when the chandelier was raised and the opera house was restored to its former glory.  The Mirror/Phantom of the Opera scenes are gripping and mysterious.  Masquerade was a joy to watch.  The dancing was choreographed wonderfully, the entrance of the Phantom was exciting.  Nothing in the movie tops the ending scenes.  The \\"final battle\\" is thrilling, the singing flawless.  It's very easy to get caught up in it.  I have been moved to tears nearly every time I see the Phantom singing \\"hide your face so the world will never find you...Christine, I love you.\\"  The pain and agony that you can see on his face is heartbreaking.<br /><br />This DVD is one complete package, well worth the money.  The movie is amazing, packed with love, loss, and lots of music.  The extra disk has a very cool \\"making of\\" feature, as well as a history of the Phantom clip (very interesting, but I felt like it was a little long and slow in some parts).  The cut scene \\"No One Would Listen\\" is also very, very good.  My only regret is not seeing this masterpiece in the theater!in some parts).  The cut scene \\"No One Would Listen\\" is also very, very good.  My only regret is not seeing this masterpiece in the theater! <br />                  <br />
B000002KKS|5.0|All of these ozzy d*ck suckers need to go jump off a very high cliff with lots of sharp jagged rocks at the bottom. They fail to realize that Tony Iommi was/is the real sound behind Black Sabbath, and Ozzy was only a mouth piece for lyrics which he didn't even write, so he was really only along for the ride any way. This album is always going to be overshadowed and neglected in favor of the earlier 70's works simply because ozzy isn't on it, what a shame, because it is arguable the best album Black Sabbath ever cut, period. Everything came togeather so perfecty here, The songwritting, arangment, production, musicianship, i can't think of a finer classic hard rock platter then this. <br /> <br />This was my second Black Sabbath album, before this i had owned a tape copy of \\"We Sold Our Souls For Rock 'n' Roll\\" which i quickly upgraded to disc. \\"Heaven and Hell\\" was played on the radio alot back in the day so that was what prompted me to buy it. Most of the reviews (good and bad) here are both right about one thing; this sounds nothing like the traditional \\"doom and gloom\\" Black Sabbath which oozed out numbers like \\"Sweet Leaf\\" and \\"Iron Man\\", this is more energetic and inspirational, and a hell of a lot more technical. <br /> <br />Dio belts out the best preformance in his career on this, Rainbow was great, and even his solo stuff isn't bad, but i belive he never topped this. This album also shows  much more developed and mature guitar work from Tony Iommi, one of my all time favorite guitar heros. It is much more layered and well thought out then  preivious albums, the solos are exetremly well placed and emoptional, i get chills when ever i hear the twin solos at the end of the song \\"Lonley Is The Word\\". Geezer Butler is just all over the bass neck on this as well, the bass guitar is very audible (like on most BS albums) and very bombastic and catchy (listen to that bass intro on \\"Lady Evil\\").My only complaint is Bill Ward (a small one), he seems to have calmed downa bit and become a more conventional \\"drummer\\" instead of his original style. <br />Bill Ward has learned to becaome a more solid timekeeper behind the drum kit on this, he is not as wild as he was before and has seemed to have droped the whole \\"chaotic jazz beat\\" thing in order to fit the overall faster tempo of this record. <br /> <br />Every song on this thing is like a 10, except for the title track which is a 12.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNSK|5.0|Although the first version of the movie was good for a musical, this version is absolutely wonderful!  Johnny Depp makes this movie!  I can't see anyone else playing the role of Willy Wonka anywhere near as good as Mr. Depp.  I'm glad that Tim Burton decided to stay faithful to the book by Roald Dahl.  I laughed through almost the entire movie as did my three children.  This movie will definitely be added to my DVD collection when it is released!
B00005JNSK|5.0|On a lighter note, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is WONDERFUL! Despite knowing what it entails, it's still brilliant in my eyes! And Johnny Depp is nothing short of AMAZING in this film. I now think Willy Wonka is Hot and I WOULD indeed marry the man! All in all, Great movie!
0316666343|3.0|I'd heard a lot of hype about this book, and saw it for $1 at a thrift store, so I decided I might as well check it out. I'm glad it wasn't more than a dollar, however. It's not that it was a terrible book, but it definitely wasn't the best book I've ever read. I don't really understand what all the hype was about. Alice Sebold is a very good writer, but some parts of the book were a little ridiculous. I understand that the narrator, Susie Salmon, is watching from heaven, and that Alice Sebold hasn't been to heaven, so she doesn't know exactly what it's like. So obviously, there is going to be some fantasy mixed in with the dramatic-ness of the story. However, there were just some things that I was like, \\"WHAT?\\" after I read them. I don't want to give anything away, but there is a part where Susie comes back to earth, just for a few hours, and lives in her friend's body as her friend hangs out in heaven for a few hours. It was just...weird. <br /> <br />Besides that part, and a few others, it was a pretty decent book. I wouldn't exactly recommend it, but if you're bored and happen to see it being sold for a dollar, go ahead and buy it. Or, borrow it from the library. Just to warn you, though, it is really depressing, and although all the critics talk about all the \\"hope\\" that there is in the novel, it really doesn't get positive until maybe the last chapter.

B0001AP12G|5.0|I have been a hip-hop/rap fan since I was baby, and I have to say that this album is the greatest that I have heard in a long, long, LONG time. Kanye West delievers soulful music and plenty of humor on this album, he brings music that you can FEEL and issues that everyone can relate to. Many rappers LACK the ability to talk about topics other than women, cars, and jewelry but Kanye talks about topics that are rarely mentioned in rap music; religion, slavery, struggles, education, working at the GAP, etc. But on the real, Kanye's music is something that everyone can relate to.. if they HATE their job at the mall, or if they want to just make a change. My personal favorites are \\"We Don't Dare\\", \\"All Falls Down\\", \\"Spaceship\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"Jesus Walks\\", \\"School Spirit\\", \\"Two Words\\", \\"Family Business\\", \\"Last Call\\" and all of the skits on the CD.

B00005JNSK|5.0|I didn't want the movie to be bad.  I love Tim Burton and think Johnny Depp is the riskiest actor we have an screen.  I also loved the original movie for it's own merits, and at it's first viewing thought Gene Wilder was a genius.  Can these two movies exist on their own merits...certainly I think they should.  The origina; had it's flaws...the musical numbers had high points(Candy Man, my Imagination...and the oompa loompa songs) and low points(Cheer up Charlie)...the look is pretty dated.  The new version has it's weirdnesses as well.<br /><br />But is it a watchable movie on it's own merits???  Absolutely.  If you want Wilder, rent it.  No one is taking away your nostalgia by putting another slant on it.  I feel the movie was very funny, certainly no more sick and twisted than the source it was created from.  In fact, the tone of the movie, especially at the beginning, is very Dahlish.<br /><br />There are diversions, Dahl himself wrote the first screenplay and managed to divert it as well, such as the Wonka father subplot...but I feel like the movie creates a world and joyously romps around in it.<br /><br />As for Depp...he is fearless.  Only he would delve into such an iconic role with such quirkiness.  Michael Jackson...I don't see it.  I feel like that is cheap.  He is funny, a little demented, and there are hints at him being premeditated...but he does a fantastic job..<br /><br />The other actors are well suited, Highmore is great and David Kelly is especially good in the first half.<br /><br />It is a very well done film...and worth a view....But not if you're going to hate it right off the bat....why spend your money to hate something.
B00005JNSK|4.0|There is something intrinsically magical about Roald Dahl's book \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\". The story of Charlie Bucket, a little boy who lives with his dirt poor family in a shack near the famous Wonka Chocolate Factory, Charlie is lucky enough to win one of five golden tickets offered by Willy Wonka for a one-time visit to tour his amazing factory. Each of the other four children is the very embodiment of a problem common to young people; Augustus Gloop is a greedy kid who eats all the candy and chocolate he can get his hands on, Veruca Salt is a spoiled brat who gets everything she wants, Violet Beauregard is a little know-it-all who simply has to be best and Mike Teavee is obsessed with all things television. And then there is Charlie. Charlie is so poor that he doesn't want anything that he doesn't already have, and all he has is the love of his family. Arriving at the factory, the five children and their parents, meet Willy Wonka, the eccentric, strange chocolatier, and their lives will be changed forever.<br /><br />That we all know from the book, which I will venture to put forth, may be the best children's book of all time.<br /><br />Previously made into a film in 1971, \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\" stars Gene Wilder as the strange man who lives in a large factory populated by pygmies. The film is well - remembered for its fanciful, day glow renderings of the interior of Wonka's factory, Wilder's tour de force performance and the other elements faithfully recreated from the book.<br /><br />Tim Burton's new film, \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", starring Johnny Depp as Wonka and Freddie Highmore as Charlie (both in \\"Finding Neverland\\") will also be remembered for it's fanciful, vivid renderings of the interior of Wonka's factory, Depp's tour de force performance (for both good and bad) and all of the other elements faithfully recreated from the book.<br /><br />They sound similar, don't they? Yes. I wouldn't classify \\"Willy Wonka\\" as a classic, it's more of a cult classic. And Burton's version is very good, but not great. The major improvement between the two is the improved production design.<br /><br />Depp's performance is good. Wonka is a strange guy and Depp seems to be channeling the spirit of Michael Jackson for the role, which is actually more than a little fitting. Both characters were deprived of a childhood and now spend every moment of their adult lives trying to recapture it. I wonder if Jackson will consider the performance a compliment or an insult. Like Michael Jackson isn't going to see the film?<br /><br />Wonka's bobbed hair, porcelain face which never seems to age and odd clothing give him a slightly effeminate look. Depp uses this as the first step in recreating the role. As Wonka, Depp imbues the character with a childlike sensibility and vocal pattern. As he speaks with his five invited guests, he seems most comfortable when they are acting like children. This also means that he is most comfortable around Charlie, because Charlie hasn't had had the influences the other kids have had. When they aren't acting like kids, he becomes bratty, belligerent and confused.<br /><br />Freddie Highmore is the real standout of the film. He seems to completely get the character of Charlie; despite the odds of finding one of five golden tickets, throughout the world, he still holds out hope.

Living in a one -room shack that appears it will blow over, the family subsists on a diet of cabbage soup but the important thing is that they have each other's love, which helps them get through. Mom (Helena Bonham Carter, with a dental prosthetic) and Dad (Noah Taylor) care for their parents, all four of which spend every day in one bed. Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) and the other three grandparents provide Charlie with the love and support he needs. All of this helps Charlie become a pretty fantastic kid.

B000001FRY|5.0|I can remember when I was a casual fan, first researching U2's back catalogue, and I wondered if Boy would be worth my money.  Sure, the Best Of collections, The Joshua Tree, and All That You Can't Leave Behind were great, but would this album of obscure tracks from 1980 be anywhere near as good?  You may be wondering a similar thing, and let me give you a simple answer: YES, Boy is worth your money; YES, Boy is extremely good. <br /> <br />I've been a U2 fanatic for a few years now, and Boy is my fourth favourite album.  For good reason too: it is consistent in quality, contains some U2 classics, and is full of the passion of a youthful band striving to make a name for themselves and establish their career.  On this album, you will hear the sounds of a band who possess a true energy and love for what they are doing; this isn't the sound of four pretentious Dublin punks or a pack of guys just looking to score girls and money, but the sound of four enthusiastic Irishmen coming to grips with the transition from childhood to adulthood. <br /> <br />Bono's vocals are less refined and Edge wasn't yet a technical wizard with the guitar, but that in no way should be taken as a slight against the album.  It opens with what has become a U2 classic, I Will Follow, an energetic post-punk rocker written by Bono about his mother's untimely death when he was fourteen.  This song has gone on to be the only number played on every single U2 tour, and thus it's no surprise that it currently holds the record for the song played the most live.  The other well known song on the album is track five, Out Of Control: this was U2's first single in 1979 and was penned by Bono on his eighteenth birthday.  It is another upbeat, exciting number with a fun, short solo by The Edge, and is followed by another song about adolescence, Stories For Boys, which contains a line of \\"hello, hello\\" that will remind you of U2's recent hit, Vertigo.  Next comes The Ocean, a short, somewhat meandering and atmospheric number that U2 brought back on this tour (the Vertigo Tour) as a nod to the wide-eyed idealism and naivety of their beginnings. <br /> <br />Also brought back into the setlist this tour after an absence of more than seventeen years is track ten, The Electric Co.  This may be my favourite song on the album: it is aggressive, passionate, and rocking, and is one of U2's first serious attempts at social commentary.  It remarks upon a violent form of electric convulsion therapy given to mental patients in Ireland in the late seventies, and the outrage of the entire band is evident in this song, from Bono's angry vocals and confrontational lyrics to Edge's aggressive guitar and the powerful rhythm created by Adam on bass and Larry pounding the drums. <br /> <br />My second favourite song on the album co-incidentally happens to be the second track, Twilight.  This is another one of Boy's darker songs, which Bono described as being about the \\"grey area of adolescence\\", where, to quote the song itself, \\"in the shadow, boy meets man\\".  It is followed by another darker song, An Cat Dubh, this time touching on the dark side of love, though it can feel almost sensual at times before it segues smoothly into Into The Heart, a tender reminiscence of childhood. <br /> <br />I'll leave the remaining three tracks a mystery, even though I think A Day Without Me is one of the best on the album.  You need to have some surprises left on the album, some hidden gold to uncover, and I've written quite enough already.  The only negative about Boy is that it fails to include 11 O'clock Tick Tock, a non-album single from that era that became one of U2's most popular and scorching live songs. <br /> <br />This album is a cunning mix of both youthful optimism and realisation of the darker side of life.  It encompasses a diversity of moods with a consistent quality in the music.  Boy is a worthy addition to any album collection. <br /> <br />By the way, if you can, get a copy with 'the boy' (Peter Rowan) on the cover.  The 'stretched faces' cover was used in the US as the record label didn't think the American public would approve of an obscure band putting a boy with no visible clothing on their cover, but I feel the cover featuring Peter Rowan is much better and more appropriate to the album.  It will also go nicely with a copy of the War album that you should have in your possession.
0226264211|5.0|Referring to one of the previous reviews of this book, yes, it indeed is still relevant after 40 years. Every socialist lie that people have accepted as truth just because it sounds great is blown to bits in this book. If you want to know what real freedom means and how to achieve it, this book is a great start. Just like the other great economists of the 20th century, whose words and ideas keep on reappearing as new long after their death (Hayek, Hazlitt, Nock, Fisher), this book is one for the ages.
B000001F3C|5.0|Sunday Bloody Sunday.  New Year's Day.  Two of the greatest political rock songs ever written.  What I'm sure any prospective buyer would like to know, however, is whether the rest of the album is as good.  Simply put: yes! <br /> <br />I admit to a little bit of bias - I consider New Year's Day to be one of the ten greatest songs ever made, featuring Adam Clayton's most distinctive bass line, quality drumming by Larry Mullen, soaring vocals by Bono, and most notably, Edge performing triple duty on guitar, piano, and backing vocals (a pleasure to watch live!).  And yet track five, Drowning Man, is almost as good.  This is one of the most beautiful songs U2 have ever made, with touching lyrics, epic vocals, and perfect instrumentation.  This is one of those lovely, soothing songs full of hope that can pick you up out of any bad mood. <br /> <br />Larry's famous drumroll opens both Sunday Bloody Sunday and the whole album, and what follows is one of the most passionate, earnest, and famous political rockers of the last two decades.  Next is Seconds, a song that may seem a little lyrically dated, but features a neat breakdown: the entire band stops and a clip known as 'Soldier Girls' plays, but if you listen closely through headphones, you will hear another voice, and its most notable remark is that \\"I can't give nothing to anybody else any more; it's been stripped, it's been taken\\".  Vintage U2, cleverly and subtly making a powerful commentary. <br /> <br />Wedged between New Year's Day and Drowning Man is Like A Song, one of U2's hardest rockers that vehemently answers their critics and criticises what the punk movement became - in Bono's words, it became \\"dressing up\\".  Track six, The Refugee, is unpopular amongst fans, but I rather enjoy it, especially Bono's passionate, urgent vocals.  The next song is a more popular one, Two Hearts Beat As One, though I don't consider it overly spectacular.  Tracks eight and nine are Red Light and Surrender, and the two are thematically connected - they are both social commentary based on an experience Bono had meeting a woman for whom everyday life was not sufficiently satisfying.  This can be summed up in a verse from Surrender: <br /> <br />Sadie said she couldn't work out what it was all about <br />So she let go <br />[...] <br />She tried to be a good girl and a good wife <br />Raise a good family, lead a good life, it's not good enough <br />She got herself up on the forty-eighth floor <br />Gotta find out, find out what she's living for <br /> <br />The songs are musically different, and Red Light not only sounds cheesily eighties but features some poor singing from Bono, but they are interesting thematically and Surrender features Edge trying out a lap steel. <br /> <br />We now come to the final track, 40.  From the beginning of the War Tour on 26 February 1983 to the final Lovetown Tour show on 10 January 1990, this song closed all but twenty U2 concerts, and in the process, gained an epic reputation as one of the greatest closers of all time.  The studio recording doesn't equal the live versions, especially as it was hurriedly recorded on the final day of the War sessions, but the seeds are there, and it is still a beautiful prayer to end the album, in contrast to the forceful introduction. <br /> <br />The only negative in my opinion is the song selection: why was Red Light included at the expense of New Year's Day's b-side, Treasure (Whatever Happened To Pete The Chop?), and why did U2 release A Celebration as a single instead of holding onto it for War?  That's only a minor point, though, and doesn't stop the album from receiving the five stars it deserves.  It's passionate, political, and demands your attention.  Rock music for the thinking and politically-conscious person.
B00005B58Y|5.0|This is an amazing Miles record I find myself constantly listening to.  It features the same line-up from KIND OF BLUE, and we get to hear the true potential of this sextet. <br /> <br />There are three tracks that really stand out for me on this release.  First of all, we hear a clean, crisp recording of Dizzy Gillespie's 'Two Bass Hit' - I enjoy this version a lot more than the bonus track on the ROUND BOUT MIDNIGHT remaster.  There's a little reverb on the recording and it features some of the most well constructed soloing I've ever heard from Miles. <br /> <br />This is also a landmark album because of the title track.  This is the first time Miles experimented with the modal playing that would turn KIND OF BLUE into the highly acclaimed masterpiece it is today.  On the flip side, we can hear a hesitant Coltrane who would not develop that style of soloing until later releases.  However, once Coltrane would learn to master modes, it would prove vital in later trane works like GIANT STEPS.   <br /> <br />Another favorite track of mine is 'Sid's Ahead', clocking in at over 10 minutes in length and featuring some beautiful solos from Adderly and Coltrane. <br /> <br />If you're looking for more Miles featuring the KIND OF BLUE lineup, look no further than MILESTONES.  I actually prefer this to the latter simply because of mood.  I find KIND OF BLUE to be stagnant and bland at times, especially when comparing it to this record, which is more energetic and upbeat.
0440418569|3.0|Significant questions seem to be dutifully answered in this last book of the series. It carries on Will's and Lyra's journey in \\"The Subtle Knife\\" with a beginning of scores of happenings from different angles that may cause a mild confusion. The numerous types of life forms are sometimes exhausting to comprehend. Yet, Mr. Pullman, being a good story teller, successfully enchants his readers with a highly imaginative turbulence in the middle chapters that prolongs to a safe conclusion. Will's and Lyra's adventures have progressed into a more mind-boggling quest. With each experience they become more courageous. I regard \\"The Golden Compass\\" as the best of the three books. Coincidence or not I suspect a trace of Tolkien's influence in the heart of the story. And, the ending admirably opens up possibilities of sequels, if need be.

B0000CABBW|5.0|I never liked and still do not care for the cover art of this movie.  Even the title turned me off... it looked like \\"Free Willy\\" or some kid/animal movie which I had no interest in.<br /><br />Somehow this movie made it to my DVD player, and it has become one of my top 10 movies of all time, and I'll tell you why.<br /><br />Powerful Drama.<br /><br />Incredible Story.<br /><br />Stunning Performances.<br /><br />Cultural Experience.<br /><br />It's that simple, really.  Without getting into the plot and all that has already been written, understand that Whale Rider is a deep, powerful story (I'd say for ages 12 and up) and is NOT a \\"kid's movie\\"; it just happens to center around a child.  Whale Rider is about familial relationships, trust, respect and honor.  As composer Lisa Gerrard put so well, \\"A sometimes dark but self effacing world of young Pai's (the main character) beautiful and difficult relationship with her grandfather that is heart rendingly defined by her awareness of her own identity, the depth of which we so often underestimate in our own children.\\"<br /><br />The cinematography is incredible... beautifully shot, and CGI-free.  Lisa Gerrard's score is not just an added layer or an underscore, but it becomes an integral part of the movie's power.<br /><br />Take a journey into this magical adventure you'll never forget.  Congrats to Niki Caro on taking a story I had never heard of, and bringing this fascinating cultural history to life.  Thanks also to all the people involved in the movie (the majority of the cast were the actual people from New Zealand with no acting experience).  Hats off to Keisha Castle-Hughes, the new young actress who truly made the picture believable.<br /><br />The DVD has an informative behind-the-scenes documentary worth seeing as well.

0449227421|3.0|There was a professor, a politician and a businessman. They were evil old Republicans, and back in Nixon's time they worked out how to clone people. Being Republicans they wanted to perfect the white American race. I think the idea was to create a WASP master-race and abolish welfare, possibly replacing it with slavery. They were even against gun control.<br /><br />Fast-forward twenty years. Here comes a six-foot young woman with big hair - a world-class tennis player as well as brilliant scientist, expert in psychology, genetics, computer science, you name it. Wow, this has to be Jolie McGillis. Her taste in underwear is lovingly described. Surprisingly she isn't a clone but she takes up with one, who happens to be nicely brought up. The rest are degenerate sadists, rapists and murderers. I told you they were WASPs.<br /><br />Now our girl finds out about the other clones, partly through being such a brilliant scientist but mostly by nearly getting laid by them. Naturally the evil GOP-men can't let any of this get out, especially as the aforesaid politician is about to run for the White House and has plans to rename Washington Berchtesgaden-on-the-Potomac. (I exaggerate - a little.) So we have toing and froing and cliff-hanging, 500 pages of it, until at last the bad guys get their comeuppance and the heroine fades into the sunset with her favorite clone.<br /><br />This is not exactly trash. Follett is a fluent writer and capable of better than that. He makes the pages turn as well as anyone and one or two of his characters are fairly memorable. (Aside: some reviewers seem to think he's American. He's British and a buddy of Tony Blair, which makes him a buddy-at-one-remove of ... ahem.) I suppose he intends us to take this story somewhat seriously, but I can't do it. I've seen more plausible scenarios on the back of cereal packets. Whether you think the pages are worth turning is up to you.

B00005JNSK|4.0|Ok...so basically most of you reading these reviews, most likely already know the plot of the story. If not, here goes: Fifteen years after shutting done his factory, Willy Wonka invites the public by means of inserting 5 golden tickets in random packages of chocolate bars. Whoever, gets the golden ticket is entitled to bring 1 person with them. The first winner is Augustus Gloop who had a sure shot at winning the ticket since he eats so much candy (that he inadvertantly bit into the golden ticket as he was eating a candy bar, then we have Veruca Salt who is obnoxious as ever and won by means of her \\"daddy dearest\\" buying up boxes of the sweet chocolately goodness and having the nut shellers at his factory rip open candy wrappers until they found the golden ticket. Then, we have Mike Teavee who does just that, watches tv and plays video games. He actually managed to crack the system and figured out how to get the winning ticket, only bought 1 candy bar and insists that he doesnt even LIKE chocolate. Next is Violet Beauregard, self proclaimed \\"champion gum chewer\\" (who's got a trophy and many others to show for it) who decided that when she heard about the golden tickets, would temporarily switch to chocolate and was determined to win. Then we have Charlie (who we get introduced to early on in the film as a sweet boy who lives in a tiny home with his 4 grandparents and his parents. He happened to win the final golden ticket by chance soon after it was announced that a fifth winner turned out to be a hoax. We then see the kids go to the factory on the next day and one by one (excluding charlie) meet their fate in a fitting manner. This one was different in a few points from the gene wilder version , but it was great just the same. This time around, wonka was still creepy but more so in a way that brings a disturbing image of michael jackson to mind. (maybe its the pasty skin,i dont know? but depp was great anyway). charlie was just as sweet as the original kid who played him, violet looks like a younger version of mary kate and ashley with her wide eyes (cute kid and was believable for the role), veruca is still obnoxious, however the orginal veruca did better for the role, augustus gloop, (as mentioned elsewhere by another reviewer) does look a little fake like he's not even human, and of course...there's mike teavee, who in my opinion this time around was nowhere near as obnoxious as the original and actually came across as a smart kid who I actually felt bad for when he was shrunken.  The oompa loompas look creepier this time around (prefered the original oompas) and in my opinion the original songs were better. (it seems that in this one the music tended to drown out the lyrics and i couldnt hear the words at times). you could tell the effects in this one were computerized whereas in the original it was a set that was just breathtaking. But... put all this aside about it being a remake and just go see it. It's very nicely done.
B000002GBJ|5.0|Yeah, it's dated, it's all over the place, it doesn't have any link to it's subject, but it has so many great musical moments I forgive every fault it may have. <br />The themes, tones and timbres explored were revolutionary at the time and to me as a keyboard player, it was the Sgt Pepper of it's day. <br />On a par with his later Criminal Record for compositional merit, it wins for it's lack of vocals or Rick's mediocre lyrics.
B00005JNJT|5.0|Batman Begins is the long awaited fifth film in the Warner Bros.Batman Series.This series started off strong with Tim Burton's first film Batman with Kim Basinger as Vicky Vale,the love interest for both our hero and our villian,Jack Nicholson having a field day as the psychotic Joker,and in one of the strangest casting decisions ever that actually worked,Michael Keaton played Batman and Bruce Wayne and he played both roles brilliantly.After three years,Tim Burton returned to Batman in Batman Returns,where Batman(once again Michael Keaton,playing the role sadly for the last time)fighting the powerful duo of Catwoman(played by a amazing Michelle Pfiefer) and the Penguin(played by Danny DeVito,who really didn't do that great)while Bruce Wayne is falling for Catwoman's alter-ego,Selina Kyle,who wants revenge on her boss for killing her.While Returns is a good chapter,it was called too dark and depressing,which is true.It was decided that the series needed to become lighter.    Three years passed and Batman returned in Batman Forever.A new director in Joel Schumacher made things more colorful and a little cheesy.Batman(now played by Val Kilmer,who was better than Keaton,IMO)now taking on the sinster Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones)and the insane Riddler(played by a absolutley hilarious Jim Carrey)with the help of his new found ally,Robin(Chris O'Donnell).All this is happening while Bruce has found a new love interest in Dr.Chase Meridan(Nicole Kidman).All in all,Forever was a huge hit,despite not being a favorite in the series.Next,Batman & Robin.Batman(now played by George Clooney)and Robin(Chris O'Donnell,again)take on another group of villians:Mr.Freeze(Arnold Schwarzenegger),Poison Ivy(Uma Thurman),and her flunky,Bane.With the help of Batgirl(Alicia Silverstone),our heroes must stop the villans before it's too late.Although I enjoy this film,many people hate it and it's okay.It was considered to be the worst Batman film ever and the worst of the Schumacher films.    Anyway,the series was considered dead.......until now!!!!!    Batman is back in a big way in this amazing film directed by Christopher Nolan.This film gives the resons of how Bruce Wayne  became the Dark Knight.Bruce Wayne(Christain Bale,who is the best Batman EVER)is in the Himalayas where our story begins in a prison cell where a man named Henri Ducard(Liam Neeson)offers Bruce a chance to join the League of Shadows,where Bruce can be taught how to fight against injustice under the leadership of the mysterious Ra's Al Ghaul.After he learns some incredible skills,he decides to return to Gotham and do something about the criminals who run the streets.With the help of his loyal butler and friend Alfred(Michael Caine),a man named by Lucius Fox(Morgan Freeman)who makes his equipment,and Defense Attorney and childhood friend,Rachel Dawes(Katie Holmes),he will battle the psychotic Scarecrow(Cillian Murphy),evil crime boss Falconie(Tom Wilkimson),and the ruler of the League of Shadows himself,Ra's Al Ghaul.    This is the most intelligent and best of the series.The plot is great and has several twists and turns.The cast is great:Morgan Freeman,Michael Caine,Liam Neeson,and Tom Wilkimson are great in the roles they have been given,especially the first three I mentioned.Katie Holmes does decent in her role,just don't expect anyting groundbreaking.Cillian Murphy is terrific in the role of the Scarecrow and is downright scary.And Christain Bale IS Batman and makes you forget Kilmer,Keaton,and especially Clooney.He is amazing in the role and he is the best Bruce Wayne,too.    So,if you weren't satisfied by the first four,Begins will be the one you'll enjoy!!!!!! See this as soon as possible!The Ultimate Batman movie is here and it's Batman Begins!!!!!!
B000092ZYX|4.0|I don't know if my fellow Kid A and Amnesiac fans liked this more or less than the two I just mentioned. Even thought I liked the album, I liked this album less.  <br /> <br />2 + 2 = 5 - Nice rock...but it's even nice before it gets to the big rock part. Old school (albums before Kid A) Radiohead fans as well as new-school (Kid A, Amnesiac) ones will like this. The beat in both parts are well done.  <br /> <br />Sit Down Stand Up - My favorite off this whole album (or maybe a tie with The Gloaming)and I love eveything about it. The song goes from slow and quiet to loud and fast paced. The beginning just sounds magical and the piano work is subtle and \\"story-tale\\" like. I love the effects they did on Thom's voice when he sings \\"weeeeeeee can wipe you out anytime\\". The ending \\"the raindrops...\\" gets much more rowdy and more electronic and the drumming is excellent. It seems that this song is ignored by most people. I can understand the ending might grate peoples nerves, but I love it. <br /> <br />Sail To The Moon - quiet...pleasant. I don't listen to it much. Not electronic-y or fast paced but calm. <br /> <br />Backdrifts, Go To Sleep, Where I End & You Begin - I can see a lot of people liking these songs. I don't listen to them very much. They are not electronic-y and more band based here. <br /> <br />We Suck Young Blood - slow...strange...a little creepy. I don't like this one at all. <br /> <br />The Gloaming - My other favorite on this album. I do not hear too many call this a favorite or many that say they like it. It starts out with noises that sound almost like you're crumpling up a peice of paper with an electronic effect on it. Then there is a pulsing beat to it. I just love the vocals on this one. It is very electronic based.  <br /> <br />There There - another nice rock song...you can really appreciate the guitar work done in this one.  <br /> <br />I Will - mmm...mellow...nice vocals. I like the song much better backwards...Like Spinning Plates style.<br /> <br />Myxomatosis - the style and beat might confuse you a bit when you first hear it. Some of the instruments sound a bit abrasive, but it works. I don't listen to it as much, but I do like it. It's fairly loud and moderate paced. The lyrics are rather fun. <br /> <br />Punch Up At A Wedding - another slower paced song...a song many will appreciate. <br /> <br />Scatterbrain - a softer low key song...really pleasant to listen to. What I like most about this song is the drum work and the mellow guitar. It's a relaxing mellow song. <br /> <br />A Wolf at the Door - It seems that every Radiohead fan likes this one and I know that non-Radiohead fans would like it too. There is also a message in the song that I think I might understand, but it's something interesting to figure out. It's a slow song with no electronic influences used. The whole song is well done, not just the chorus or verse.  <br /> <br />Pablo Honey, The Bends and OK Computer fans may not love this, but I think they would surely find some tracks on here worth their time. This is less electronic based than their last wo albums. Amnesiac fans might like this a little more than Kid A fans. Overall...I think that Radiohead fans would find this album listen-worthy. For non-Radiohead fans, well I'd say it would be something new, but I think there would be some a bit dissapointed. Like I said with Kid A and Amnesiac, it's not an album to dance in the club with, play at a party or to headbang or mosh to. I tried to describe the songs because I tend to love the songs that most of the fans don't, so I figured it would be fair.

B00005B4GU|5.0|I am a big Radiohead fan...a bigger fan of their latest more electronic driven work. I've been listening to these songs since the album first came out and I am still listening. I loved Kid A, it's one of my top 5 favorites and so is Amnesiac. This album is one of the few I can listen to and not skip any tracks. This is an album qute tricky to describe. For those who loved Kid A, would most likely like Amnesiac. Amnesiac seems like a darker version of Kid A...not quite the same, but similar in terms of the experimental feel. People who listen to Pop, R&B and rap the majority of the time, I would listen to clips before buying this because it may certainly not be your cup of tea. Old school Radiohead fans might be a bit dissapointed, but there are some songs on here that they would like. I'm not one to worship and fawn all over celebrities, but Radiohead has a talent that surpases not all, but many of their current industry peers. The artwork in the album is also similar to the one in Kid A. <br /> <br />Packt like sardines in... - The title alone is intriguing. This song starts out kind of subtle with a metallic type of beat and it spawns into something not to racous but there is a collection of instruments and thom singing. You can tell it's electronic based.  <br /> <br />Pyramid song - Whoa...pay attention to the arrangement of music here. You start out with the piano, the vocals then it turns out to sound like some type of soundtrack music with a killer arrangement with strings at the end. I actually think this is one of the best songs on the album. Even if you aren't a Radiohead fan, you'll most likely like it. There is no electronic feel to this one. This is my second favorite song. <br /> <br />Pulk/pull revolving doors - I've seen a lot of reviewers say they don't like this song, whether or not the were a Radiohead fan. I like it! It starts with some choppy beats and a strange type of electronic drum n bass (but not quite) feel to it.  <br /> <br />You and whose army? - A lot of people who liked the more old school Radiohead would like this. Nice music arrangement and vocal work.  <br /> <br />I might be wrong - More old school Radiohead...not one of my favorites, but I will still listen to it because it is pleasant.  <br /> <br />Knives out - Not too electronic-y...not too mellow...I think a lot of people will like it.  <br /> <br />Amnesiac/Morning bell - This is one of the songs on this album that I think define the album. It's not just because of the title, but because it is so eerie sounding and dark and dreamish, and it fits with the artwork in the album. It is hard to explain but it is basically a new version of \\"Morning Bell\\" off of Kid A. You hear the strange vocals in the background. The lyrics are pretty much the same except they left the \\"walking walking\\" part out of it. The only thing that is the same of the two versions is the lyrics...the songs do not sound the same, or at least very little. My favorite on here. <br /> <br />Dollars & Cents - I like this chilled out mellow song. Not electronic sounding, relaxing and the music (just like always) works well together. Even though it doesn't have electronic genre qualities to it, it fits on this album for sure. <br /> <br />Hunting Bears - It's interesting to think why they called this track what they did. It's basically mainly a guitar driven song...and it's short. I would say it would be a favorite to very few because it's not really built into a developed song really. However, I still find it interesting to listen to. <br /> <br />Like Spinning Plates - I think my second/third favorite on the album. It's built on a backwards version of \\"I Will\\" (another radiohead song). The song reminds me of the Amnesiac Morning Bell because of the actual music. It sounds dark and a little creepy and I absolutely love it.  <br /> <br />Life in a Glass House - This song is more jazzy. I don't really like it, but it works out fine because it's the end of the album and I don't have to listen to it. <br /> <br />I saw that some reviewers said it was the return of old Radiohead...I honestly don't think that is the case...and there will be some old school Radiohead fans that are going to be upset because they expected something else. I also hope no one said that Radiohead sold out because that couldn't be any more further than the truth. I tried to explain the genres of each song because a lot of people tend to gear to certain genres. I'm more of a rock and electronic listener, so it wouldn't help if I said \\"all of them are good!\\". Hope it helps.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This movie is throughly enjoyable! Very funny! Both males and females can enjoy this, and any age group as well! I get a kick out of it, every time I watch it. If you haven't seen this movie yet, definitely go out and purchase it! However don't buy the 2nd one with it!
B00004XONN|5.0|5 stars, and I'm not playing. This is the first Radiohead album I've bought and I knew it was money well spent. I STILL listen to the album after the years I bought it when it came out. I love everything from the artwork in the booklet thing to the music. Now before I get labeled as a Radiohead groupie or a \\"blind-Radiohead fan who praises everything they come up with\\" at least hold on. I mainly listen to rock and electronic subgenres (Alec Empire, Aphex Twin, Bjork etc.), so when I found out about Radiohead's latest style, I knew this would be for me.  <br /> <br />Everything In Its Right Place - Love the mellow it is so rich with. This is no headbanging song but it's intense for sure. It sounds like a rhodes keyboard or a softer piano sounding keyboard. The vocals by Thom are soothing and you also have the occasional electronic effects on his voice. <br /> <br />Kid A - Another fairly soothing atmospheric song.  <br /> <br />The National Anthem - more rock in this one and intense too. There is nothing too mellow about this one. You have the occasional loud horns playing some melodies and you have the addictive bass guitar on it. It's a favorite to many. <br /> <br />How To Disappear Completely - More of an old school radiohead type of song. I like it a lot...calm and soothing. Thom's voice sounds a little sad. The guitar work is nicely done. <br /> <br />Treefingers - very atmospheric...experimental...relaxing...again, no headbanging or fast dancing here. This is a song you just simply listen to. If you just feel like chilling out or lying down, this could be a good candidate. Certainly not on the same mood level like the next song... <br /> <br />Optimistic - THE rock song of the album. No lack of guitars here...there's plenty of them. This is one that I'm sure even non-Radiohead fans would like. No electronic traces here for those who don't like the electronic route Radiohead went on this album.  <br /> <br />In Limbo - !!!!!!!It's my favorite song on this album, probably my favorite Radiohead song ever. It starts out with an echoing sound and transforms into this beautiful guitar work and beautiful overall music. Nothing here is to be ignored, I love all of the music and vocals that each musician in the band contributed. Its's a slow atmospheric song that you fall into (or at least me). It sounds nice on headphones but even better when you play it loudly. The ending is a little strange but nice as it fades into a \\"wish-wash-wish\\" type of sound. The song itself is pretty much indescribable...I did the best I could.  <br /> <br />Idioteque - It's almost on every Radiohead fan's at least top 10 favorite. A moderate tempo techno beat with Thom's vocals (they sound a little whinny, but still good!) I like this song, no doubt, but I found two other songs on this album I found my favorites.  <br /> <br />Morning Bell - I love the \\"music/sound\\" that left off from idioteque and leaded into Morning Bell. The drummer has again done a fine job. The drum work on this song shines and it's the most noticeable in my opinion. This is my second favorite on this album...it's just so pleasant and different I can't ever get sick of it. I like the little guitar sounds around the middle of the song.   <br /> <br />Motion Picture Soundtrack - this song, I admit is a song I never payed much attention to. The song sounds like there is a type of organ played. Not rock-ish or electronic-y... <br /> <br />my favorites: In Limbo & Morning Bell <br /> <br />If you don't have this album and you liked Amnesiac's electronic based songs, then I think you would love Kid A. Kid A isn't as dark as Amnesiac, but it has some of the properties in Amnesiac that are worth listening to. This is NOT old school Radiohead (The Bends, Pablo Honey, etc). I'll make it clear...this is not the type of album you want to play at a baby shower or a party. You play this with your headphones, in your room, or with fellow Radiohead fans or electronic fans. It's not club music. It is not headbanging or social music! Don't even look to this album if you cannot stand electronic music. It is surely ear candy to those who can also appreciate less commercial music.
B00003CXI1|3.0|If you had read Harry Potter before, you should know how bad the movie is. I really like the each and everyone of the charactors. The person that chose the actors did a good job. But it was very disappointed how the movie ended. I don't mind at all if other part of the movie is not accurate to the book, but the end and the conflict is a MUST!!!!! I was all good untill the end. shame shame
B0006L16N8|2.0|I've tried to hear through both types of hype for this third Coldplay release.  Yet with the media buzz, the band itself touting its (playful) competition with U2, and the full ubiquity of their music everywhere, it's near impossible to hear X&Y on its own merits.  So let's say this:  the lyrics are hopeless, mostly built on cliches and the ache in Chris Martin's voice (their secret weapon, I say); there is a ballad or two that will definitely light up a Bic (\\"Fix You\\", for sure); the best hook on here is appropriated from Kraftwerk (\\"Talk\\" -- best song, worst lyrics).  And I think it was all a bit fresher when it was more unassuming.
B000068FY1|5.0|The first few times through, this CD made little impression on me.  Then, I really listened to it.  I was on a road trip, it was a CD I picked up on the way out the door, but it and Buddy Miller's _Universal United House of Prayer_ were the only ones I played.  And both were worth the time and attention.  At least one of these cuts--\\"Nevada, California,\\" \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" or my favorite, \\"Crowded in the Wings\\"--will eventually get to you and draw you in.  It might take a rainy-day road trip to set the mood, but the Jayhawks will eventually make you glad you listened.
0385503954|5.0|This is a brilliant piece of writing; considerably better than McEwan's Booker prize-winning Amsterdam.  Not only is the story a fascinating one but also it is structured in a very clever way that gives the reader emotional satisfaction as well as a bit of shaking-up.<br /><br />The first part of the story goes as follows: in the years before the Second World War Robbie, a brilliant young man, the son of a charwoman, falls in love with the elder daughter of his mother's employer, Cecilia.  They don't know how to communicate with each other but a wayward letter reveals all.  Unfortunately, the letter is intercepted by the younger daughter, Briony, who is a daydreamer (future writer) and is shocked by what is happening.  When a young cousin turns up raped, Briony uses the letter and a convincing lie to get the innocent Robbie sent to prison.<br /><br />Though interesting, the first part of the story is nothing compared to what is to come: Robbie out of jail and fighting in France, unable to be more that a grunt despite his education because of his conviction.  Cecilia remains loyal to Robbie, becomes a nurse and cuts herself off from her family.  Briony, now older and wiser, follows her sister into the nursing corps and tries to make-up for the disaster she has caused.  Thus, the title of the novel.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal too much but, needless to say, it's incredible.  Experiences are had and many truths are revealed and many truths the reader seems to be sure of are shown to be false.  McEwan is able to manage this feat through a constant shifting of points of view--we see the same event constantly reinterpreted and motivations we thought we understood are re-evaluated.  In the first part we see the story unfold through the eyes of Briony, Cecilia, Robbie and Mrs. Tallis (Briony & Cecilia's mother).  The second part we see through Robbie's eyes and the third part through Briony's.  Part four (London, 1999) is also seen through Briony's eyes but it is in this brief epilogue that our final certainties are shaken-up and we are made to reconsider everything.<br /><br />It has been a long time since I've read a novel that I've enjoyed so much.  Not only for it's clever, well-told story and brilliant characters but also for the technical achievement in the prose.  McEwan shows himself to be a true literary master with this book.s in this brief epilogue that our final certainties are shaken-up and we are made to reconsider everything. <br /> <br />It has been a long time since I've read a novel that I've enjoyed so much.

B000294SFW|5.0|This has to be one of the best metal albums in 20 years. Lemmy is showing the kids how metal should be done. No rap or ballads. Just one driving riff after another. If you are having a bad day throw this in and the day will instanly get better. In the Name of Tragedy ROCKS.
B0007MVXQG|5.0|This album is right up there with \\"Painkiller\\" definitely beats the crap out of all those lame MTV approved rock bands of today.
B000002GQG|5.0|After Days of Future Passed had become a success, the Moody Blues were faced with the daunting task of following up such a ground-breaking work.  They did so in 1968 with In Search of the Lost Chord, which saw them further develop their mind-expanding sound and immerse themselves in psychedelic culture.  This is probably the Moodies' most experimental and unusual album, but while it is very much a work of its time, it is full of songs which still sound great today.    Like Days of Future Passed, this is a concept album, but this time the concept sees the band on a quest for the mythical Lost Chord.  There is no orchestra this time, but the Moodies decided to be their own mini-orchestra, with each band member playing a wide variety of instruments.  Once again, every member of the band took a share of songwriting duties.  I can take or leave Grame Edge's two pieces of poetry here, (although Departure melds quite nicely into Ride My See Saw) but everyone else is on great form.  John Lodge contributes Ride My See Saw, an excellent rock number with some fine guitar from Justin Hayward, and also House of Four Doors parts 1 and 2, a haunting and unusual pair of songs; part 1 features some enjoyable musical interludes as each door in the house is creaked open.  Mike Pinder contributes to the psychedelic mood of the album with the druggy Best Way to Travel and with the sitar-drenched OM, which turns out to be the Lost Chord, while Justin Hayward is responsible for another beautiful pair of ballads in the shape of the gentle Voices in the Sky and the powerful, dramatic The Actor.  The hippy vibe which suffuses the record is also in evidence on Visions of Paradise, a lovely Hayward/Ray Thomas collaboration with some atmospheric flute work.    The finest song on the album, however, is Thomas' epic Legend of a Mind, about the LSD guru Timothy Leary.  Once again featuring some excellent flute work from Thomas, this complex song is performed by the band with utter conviction, andbuilds to a pulsating climax.  Listening to Legend of a Mind and the other songs on this album is to hear a band in the full flow of creativity and experimentation, and while in some ways the album has dated, the quality at its core makes it ultimately timeless. Listen and enjoy!
B000957O82|2.0|This movie could have been much better if it didn't all depend on Will Smith. If Kevin James was in more parts, this movie could be funnier and more entertaining. This movie had too much dialogue and that made it boring. I almost fell asleep 10 times. Do not see this movie.
B000001FO4|4.0|Long Cold Winter was released in Hair-Metal Heyday, but you can listen to this in the present without being embarrassed. Like almost every other reviewer of this album here, Cinderella headed towards a bluesier side that would become more apparant with their third album. However Long Cold Winter rocks and has some real gems.<br /><br />'The Last Mile' is probably my favorite. 'Gypsy Road' is very good also, but with MTV overkill, I really can't sit through this song too many more times. Which is not fair to say, it's an excellent song, but too much of a good thing can have it's drawbacks and MTV played the hell out of this.<br /><br />The title track is possibly the only song I was never really that crazy about. It's very long and too slow it seems. I can see how Cinderella was trying to make this their Swan Song, but to me it just didn't quite work. However rockin tunes like 'Fire and Ice', 'If you don't like it', and 'Take me back' will keep your feet tapping. Not every album from the 80's sounds as fresh as this, thanks to the lack of synthesizers. If you have worries about discovering 80's 'Hair Bands', Cinderella is not to fear. They had a lot more substance than fluffy Bon Jovi garbage.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Got the pleasure of seeing Robert Plant perform material from this album live last week in Denver, CO.  I must say that the album is not only solid but it's even more compelling performed live where there is no chance to remix or re-do.  Robert Plant continues to evolve as a performer and a person. Those stuck in Zepdom can go fly a kite. Any true Zep fan would be thrilled to see one of the boys continuing to evolve and produce music even if it diverges from that which they produced 40 years ago.  They are older, wiser, and better people and musicians...their music should be as well.  Mighty Rearranger is RPs best.  As such, I have great hope that RP will continue to produce music and tour. I'll be in line to buy the CDs and tickets!!!!
B000096I9G|5.0|While I enjoyed everything I knew from the Cure thoroughly, this DVD really put them higher as far as my respect for them than ever before. Part of the greatness is in that these already-wonderful tracks are put in the DVD, especially how they performed three albums in entirety, and what's even better is the other stuff, like the explaining of what they did. Also, the encore gave me a better appreciation for those two songs than ever before. <br /> <br />This is especially great if you like the theme of the albums. Each of these are done greatly. While The Cure was just a trio in the 'Pornography' era, there is more emphasis with more musicians in this rendition, full of nothing but strongpoints. I especially liked the performances of \\"One Hundred Years\\" and \\"The Hanging Garden\\". <br />The longest and the best is the 'Disintegration' set, which is done a bit different. I love the way that \\"Lullaby\\" is performed (in part to bassist Simon Gallup) and especially what's done in the first minute of \\"Pictures of You\\", one of my all-time favorite songs. \\"Love Song\\" has a nice guitar solo added as well as having more emphasis of keyboard than the album version. Which is good with me, since to me I feel that the keyboards make the song. He adds some German lingo in at the end of the already-wonderful \\"Fascination Street\\", particularly because it's the Berlin show of the trilogy. <br />The 'Bloodflowers' material is done well too, with super long songs that were in the set to begin with. I always loved \\"Watching Me Fall\\" so it was nice to see that one done. And Robert does use the 12-string on that track. Many other great things. <br /> <br />To me, this shines in two moments: Both 'Kiss Me' tracks, \\"If Only Tonight We Could Sleep\\" and \\"The Kiss\\". Seeing this DVD and being a guitar player, the Cure have given me a lot of ideas on that since this. Especially the former, with a classical/gothic style in its first two minutes. As well as Robert's guitar playing, with that cool scratching/sliding. \\"The Kiss\\" is a nice, agressive song and has the energy done right. <br /> <br />In the extras is mainly the inspiration of why they came up with the trilogy idea, if that's the end, and what the direction of the Cure's future would be. While some of that seems to be answered, it's nice seeing what they say on this. <br /> <br />I don't know how a Cure fan could not want this, as it's something to be proud of. It transformed me from thinking that they were great legends to a band that will always matter to me because of good talent and guitar.
B00022M518|5.0|I discovered this album at a garage sale thinking, this looks like a David Bowie knockoff.  Turns out it was all original and ahead of it's time.  Added to Robert Fripps excellent guitar playin on \\"Baby's on fire\\" & \\"Blank Frank\\" and the ear shattering(no matter how loud the volume is) guitar solo on \\"Cindy tells me\\".  Overall this album rocks more than you bargained for.
0582434068|4.0|I checked out this book from the library because I'm trying to read all of John Grisham's book and unless I see one at a garage sale, I don't have an extra $20 for a book when I need gas...Anyways, I loved the book and could never put it down. I forced myself to stop at 2AM. Even though Patrick's tricks and easy manuevering may be unrealistic to everyone, everyone likes to read something like this. It's a book. Something to take you on far away adventures that you or people you know would never begin to go on. I love how Grisham can make you feel as if you are right there hearing the characters and hopping on airplanes or looking behind your shoulder to see who is following you. The closest people can get to that in real life is knowing some local loser drug dealer who should be watching his back.<br /><br />  Sorry to say though, the ending was a bit nerve racking. I flipped through the last few pages of the book when i was finished to find an explanation of why Eva never shower up. Is someone still wanting the money who was mentioned? I just hope Mr. Grisham does not do any more endings like this. UNLESS, he has a sequel to this already long book or have an explanation on his website.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|If you like south park this movie is for you. It has a lot of comedy. If you are a person that cannot stand a lot of violence and foul language you will not like this movie. This movie is just fun and really has no point. If you like movies that you could just kid around you will like this. Recommended
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The visual images although very creative, will literally make your skin crawl. If you can't handle the grim reality of addiction, this movie is not for you. Set near the Coney Island boardwalk of NY with the backdrop of the world famous Cyclone Rollercoaster, this movie takes your senses along for a thrill ride on an emotional Cyclone as you watch it. This coaster ride of addiction is a one way ride to hell and you have a front row seat.<br /><br />Although the outcomes of the addictions are the same, I like the general contrast between the young people using the street drugs and the older Ellen Burstyn hooked on her more \\"socially acceptable\\" diet pills (which are portrayed as nothing more than a legal form of speed because \\"the Docta prescribed them!\\").<br /><br />Kronos Quartet with their hypnotic fusion of classical, jazz tinged compositions add immensly to the sensory experience of this movie. In addition, excellent acting, especially by Ellen Burstyn, and the creative but graphic & disturbing visual images make this an intense cinematic experience.
B000002AZ8|3.0|This album is one I m always ashamed not to be able to like anymore than I do.  I mean I really, really want to, but there is so much material here that is easy to skip over and just listen to the better tracks.   <br /> <br />\\"Better Man\\" is the easy highlight for me, with several other good cuts as well.  However, there are many tracks on this albume that seem to go nowhere or really do nothing melodically.  I understand this is the direction and evolution the band wanted to take, and probably the reason theyre still around today (finally playing the Gorge again this Sep!) but I prefer their two albums before this one any day of the week.   <br /> <br />The actual album is gorgeous though, made like it was for an old school vinyl and loaded with tons of interesting stuff inside.  Definately a major plus and something I appreciate. <br /> <br />Any fan of Pearl Jam needs this album and if you have any interest at all get it.  You will at least appreciate it above all else, if you end up not listening to it all that much.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|Just wanted to know if the albums for sale in the HMV stores still have the Coldplay wristband available with it ... thanks !
061301328X|4.0|I've only read several hundred pages so far.  In my opinion the attention to detail from the author is superb.  My only complaint is that there are too many damn pages!  Is this an Ayn Rand book or something?
6305949980|5.0|Though a Gothic style children's movie, I quiet enjoyed this movie emensly! The characters are gorgeously created with plastacine and movie with qualities. My favourite character is Jack Skellington. Whom wants to change his same old, boring routine of being King of the Pumpkin Patch and ruler of Halloween to something new, and stumbles upon Christmas Town. Jack soon deciedes, in his good of heart, to rule over this holiday as well and brings it home to his ghoulish friends, which has horrid consequences. It is a wonderful movie and everyone I shown it too loves it as well. Though me and alot of my friend, hate Sally, we all know Jack has such better taste. This movie is my all time favourite christmas story.
0312323859|5.0|Before you read Something Blue, you really should read \\"Something Borrowed\\" which tells the story, through Rachel, of the friendship between her and Darcy, and what happens to the three of them during that summer before Darcy and Dex are to be married.  This is just an excellent continuation, told through Darcy this time, of what life is like for her after losing both her best friend, Rachel, and her fiancee, Dex, at the same time.  Darcy is a self-centered, spoiled brat, used to being the center of attention, the beautiful one, the stylish one, the one who always landed on her feet, who led a charmed life.  Now she finds herself pregnant after a fling with Dex's friend, Malcolm, and she's alone for the first time in her life. She decides to leave NYC and head to England to hook up with a friend, Ethan, and decides to create a new life for herself, thinking that she will have a better life in England.  Poor Darcy is so dilusional.  She thinks that she will be living a stylish life with a handsome refined Englishman, living in a beautiful flat in London.  Her friend Ethan brings her to reality and tells her that she has to stop thinking of herself and start thinking about her baby.  Author Emily Giffin does a wonderful job of transforming this selfish person into someone that we begin to care about, just like Ethan does, and we want her to realize that life isn't just about shopping for Blahnik shoes and getting praised for being beautiful.  It's really a great book, and one that I read in one day.... Enjoy it, but please read Something Borrowed first.  You'll be glad you did.
B000050FEN|5.0|This movie is not for everyone. But for those willing to take the leap, it affects you in ways you cannot imagine. The portrayal of characters in this movie, and the events that occur are so real that it's scary. Right from the opening credits, you know there's something special about this movie. First, I'll give a short description of the amazing storyline that is Se7en.    The movie is set in New York City. Detective Somerset, a man who has been in service for a long time, feels that he has seen too much violence and hatred in the world. He is about to retire. His last case however, intrigues him. He believes that it is a start of a serial murder. Detective Mills, who was just assigned to the department, is a young and eager detective. He helps Somerset with the investigation. The first murder was in fact, the start of a serial murder. The murderer is committing the murders based on the 7 deadly sins; namely gluttony, greed, sloth, envy, wrath, pride and lust. It is then a cat and mouse game between the detectives and the murderer, known simply as John Doe. The movie spirals to dizzying heights and ends with a stunning albeit demented plot twist.    This movie is special in so many ways, its context transcends time. It actually speaks to you. The difference between the 2 detectives alone, speak volumes. It's not just a pairing of young and old, white and black. They are very different men, having experienced different things in life. One is an optimist, and the other a pessimist. The interesting thing that separates them is their opinions and views on life, and on everyday crimes. The place, New York City is shown as a dark and decaying city. It rains everyday, the future seems bleak. And the act of murders is supposedly sermons from the man behind it. It is not random, it is planned. He wants it to be studied and analyzed, for the meaning of his act to reach people. Many things said in this movie really made me think. I found the dialogue between characters fascinating and creepy at the same time. At one point, the murderer says \\"We see a deadly sin on every street corner, in every home, and we tolerate it. We tolerate it because it's common, it's trivial. We tolerate it morning, noon, and night. Well, not anymore.\\" In some aspects, he was right. We read the newspapers everyday. Reports of murder, robbery and abuse. Crimes that are committed by men, people die everyday not of natural causes but by us. Do we even think twice about it? We just move on to the next story. It is sad that humanity has come to this. And that is what I mean, the movie touches your soul, questions the harsh reality of life. You realize the world is not as wonderful as you've imagined.    Rarely does a movie like this come to be made without a group of talented people behind it, and watching the movie, every one of them should be complimented. It takes guts to make a movie like this, it is definitely not mainstream, nor will it make anyone leaving the theater feeling good about themselves. But we need this kind of movies once a while to remind us, that movies can be great, it can affect people and make a difference rather than just entertain us. The writer does a tremendous job with the script. It is so profound and disturbingly real. Directing from David Fincher, a man I have huge respect for, is also flawless. And the acting from every one of the characters couldn't be better. Morgan Freeman is dead-on as Detective Somerset, as is Brad Pitt as Detective Mills. They both deliver what I believe the best performances of their career. And the murderer...aahh, the murderer who is left uncredited practically adds the finishing touch to an already great movie. He is so convincing, every word he mutters sends a chill down your spine. And the scary thing is, I was actually nodding to certain things he was saying. \\"Wanting people to listen, you can't just tap them on the shoulder anymore. You have to hit them with a sledgehammer, and then you'll notice you've got their strict attention.\\" To me, everything in this movie came together so well, it is so much more than \\"just a thriller\\", and the 5-star rating I give it is definitely justified.    So, if you want to be surprised, if you want to break out from the usual trash Hollywood dumps on us, if you're willing to take a risk...watch this movie. Yes, it is surreal and it does contain graphic images. But my goodness, this movie is so much more; it reflects our life and questions your conscience. One of my all-time favorites.

B000001F26|3.0|Simple...it's obsolete. THE CREAM OF CLAPTON (ASIN B000001EEA) covers a longer time period (1966-1981) with more songs (19 compared to this set's 11), it's remastered and with a better selection of great tunes from the Slowhand.<br /><br />PROS:<br />If your two favourite Clapton tunes are \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\" and \\"Swing Low Sweet Chariot\\", buy this one.<br /><br />It's really, really, really cheap used if you don't have a lot of $$$ to spend on your music.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Shorter run time, inferior sound quality, no songs from Blind Faith or Cream. No songs from after 1978<br /><br />Except the 2 mentioned above, all these songs are on THE CREAM OF CLAPTON and then some.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />Don't buy this one...save up your money and get THE CREAM OF CLAPTON instead.
B00005QXDD|1.0|I'm sorry Jack Black but you were a good actor in school of rock. But music is just not your area. This Cd is completely the worst thing i have ever heard. If you want to hear some real music that Jack Black was in then listen to the song in the movie: school of Rock, in the beginning of the movie. That's music, but this is just filth.  <br /> <br />If this is supposed to be rock like one reviewer said then why dont i hear any rock and roll riffs. This is horrible. Whoever gives this more than 2 stars has no taste whatsoever in music.  <br /> <br />Please Jack Black, come to your senses and make some real music. This is not living up to your potential. I've been playing guitar for only a year and a half and i can say this as a fact that i have more talent than everyone in this entire band. Its sad but its true. Guys come to your senses and stop jerking around. Make some real music for christ sake!!
B0000025JT|5.0|I have almost all of Streisand's Albums and I can say that Guilty  is one of The  best ones period.The Album has Barbra's great voice plus a great tempo to all the songs and a good contemporary pop feel to it.The Album was a smash hit when it was realesed making more then Triple Platnium on The Charts. With big hits like \\" Guilty , Woman in Love , And What Kind of Fool\\"  <br />On The Whole Album i dont think there is one bad song with a catchy feel and you will even catch yourself singing or humming them sometimes. With Two of my Favorites from The Album \\" Guilty & Woman in Love\\"you cant go wrong with theses songs and I think you will like them too. \\"Promosies\\" is also a very good song with a Club kind of feel. <br />Finally i suggest you not to buy this Album \\"Guilty\\" I suggest you buy the 25 th Anneversery Edition of Guilty Duel Disc out This August 23rd. And Also The Sequal to Guilty comes out in September with 12 new songs on a Duel Disc  including the song Letting Go. Cant wait till it comes out !
B0007GAEW6|5.0|The Mars Volta was the first Prog-rock band I had ever listened to (two years ago)and when I heard them I thought wow, these guys are the most amazing psychopathic people I had ever heard. My teacher gave me a mix CD of a bunch of songs, included 5 from De-loused In The Comatorium, The Mars Volta's debut album, and I basically have been listening to them ever since, not because I was listening for Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's stellar guitar parts or by Cedric Bixler-Zalava's super high voice, but their high energy and emphasis on rhythm got me alone. After exploring into the Indie/Progressive rock scene, I have come to realize that this band is definetly the most talented band out there. When I got this CD, I was expecting the spacy rock sound that I had heard with De-loused, but in return I got more of the high energy that filled their debut album, except for The Widow, which is more melody driven than other Mars Volta songs. The instruments are accentuated and the songs have more structure then De-loused and Cedric voice is as crazy as it was with De-loused and At The Drive-In, but I kind of miss the spacy, reverbed guitar parts that I had come to love. It's sort of like Frances the Mute came before De-loused. But, hey. I am not complaining about this. This is pretty much just as good.
B00005JNSK|3.0|I walked out of Tim Burton's remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory amused, but unsatisfied, and certainly not how I'd expect to feel after eating one of Mr. Wonka's scrumptdiliumptious treats. Sure, there were moments of crunchy goodness, but most of the experience involved the fancy wrapping.<br /><br />Mr. Burton's hit or miss storytelling (he can be terrific, as in Big Fish, or horrific, as in Planet of the Apes), mainly misses here. But that isn't the worst of it.  The biggest failure of the film is Willy Wonka himself. He is a character of little or no substance, inexplicable and odd for the sake of being inexplicable and odd.  As if in a last ditch effort to give the guy some depth, this hackneyed backstory about his father (who, irony of ironies, was a dentist) was spliced in through flashbacks that might be interesting if they weren't so one-dimensional.  Instead, they do little more than interrupt the flow of the story and set up an anti-climactic ending in which Willy resolves his issues with his father by visiting him.<br /><br />I must confess that I really like the original film version of the story. And it is in contrast to that gem of a film that the weaknesses of Burton's version stand out.  The Charlie of the first movie isn't a uni-dimensional angel (selfless, unflappable, never tempted), and his character is defined by a remarkable ending that offers him more temptation than even the best child ought to be able to resist.  The new Charlie, well, is perfect, start to finish.  Where's the challenge (and character development) in that?  Burton eschewed the important story features (the Slugworth bribe offers) that made the trip through the chocolate factory a rolling moral conundrum.  Burton offers no replacement story device to preserve this important subplot (instead, we get the Wonka backstory). One point of dissonance, though, is the scene in which Charlie finds a ten dollar bill in the snow and, without a second thought, uses it to buy candy. With the set up that Charlie is completely selfless, and that even a thin dime might help his starving, destitute family, his decision to keep and use the money was jarring. What lesson are we to take away from this?  Finders keepers?  (In the original film, Charlie finds a coin in a gutter ... a coin is one thing; a ten dollar bill quite another. Inflation isn't the answer. If Burton had thought about it, he might have had Charlie give the money to the candy store owner to await a claim by the real owner, and perhaps been given a candy bar as a reward.)<br /><br />Wilder's performance was one of depth and substance. Even without a backstory, you come away knowing exactly who Willy Wonka is: an extremely smart, wise, and artistic man who is on a mission to find a truly good kid.  Not a perfect one, mind you (Charlie, after all, stole the Fizzy Lifting Drinks, another episode that doesn't make it to Burton's film), but one of solid, core decency.  Wilder's character's sly comments, his fluency in multiple languages, and his knowing disdain for the creeps who've found his tickets present the picture of a person who ought to be telling us a story of right and wrong, of good kids and bad.  (Burton doesn't even have the sense to realize that it is better that we not know the fate of Charlie's competitors, leaving us to wonder whether they made it or not, and not really caring.  Instead, he leads them out of the factory like a parade of CGI.  Did we need that?  Of course not.)<br /><br />Depp's Wonka doesn't even come close to Wilder's.  He's an empty, Michael Jacksonesque misanthrope without a clue.  He doesn't seem particularly interested in Charlie, or even to recognize what makes Charlie special. They just seem to end up together because everyone else gets taken away. Even at that point, there is no meaningful interaction between them.<br /><br />There were moments of charm and humor in Willy Wonka; a twisted sense of humor infects some good scenes.  But the storyis weak, and Willy himself is weaker.  Add to that genuinely uninspired and forgettable songs and dialogue that attempts to \\"explain\\" too much, and you have another remake than ought to have stayed unmade.Add to that genuinely uninspired and forgettable songs and dialogue that attempts to \\"explain\\" too much, and you have another remake than ought to have stayed unmade.
0425043819|4.0|Why do all the ancient prehistoric religions have so many similarities? Time after time we find the same basic stories.  Gods came down from the stars in great, fiery chariots. These gods taught primitive barbarians how to build a civilization, gave them a set of rules or `commandments' concerning proper behavior, then returned to the stars with the promise that they wouldn't be gone forever.<br /><br />Why do so many ancient civilizations have cultural similarities? Time and again we encounter records showing that this or that dead empire knew more about math or astronomy than we do today. Pyramids are not exclusively Egyptian. Nor are mummies. Both have been found on nearly every continent. Pyramids around the world show similar advanced architecture and mummies often show similar methods of preparation.<br /><br />Did all these ancients have some way of communicating with each other? Unlikely. So how did all these prehistoric cultures come to bear such resemblance to each other, as if they al had the same influence or inspiration? Perhaps they did all share the same source of inspiration.<br /><br />Erich Von Daniken suggests that those gods in their fiery chariots were, in reality, advanced beings from other worlds. Yes, this is an old idea, maybe even a tired old concept. But this book was published in 1969 and this was a fairly new idea back then. And Daniken argues his case quite convincingly. Bit by bit, piece by piece, he presents his evidence and clearly ties it all together into a conclusion which is hard to refute.<br /><br />Is it science fiction or science fact? Decide for yourself. One thing is certain. There are many questions about our human history that need to be answered. The answers Erich Von Daniken presents may or may not be right but they are certainly thought provoking.
B0007OCG56|2.0|It was good in the begining but got VERY boring in the end. The whole movie was slow pacing without much excitement. I even fell asleep close to the end!
B0000TB01Y|3.0|Wicked has fast become a favorite among casual Broadway fans and theatre teens. After a brief skim of the reviews here on Amazon, it's got no shortage of supporters, so this review isn't going to bring down the star average or whatever else would compel fan-girls of this show to give me a \\"no\\" for whether this review was helpful or not. <br /> <br /> That aside, full disclosure: I have not seen Wicked. However, I'm not reviewing the show. I'm reviewing the Original Broadway Cast Recording and the songs on it. For someone who cannot go to Broadway often, reading synopses and buying cast albums is my way of keeping up with what's on the Great White Way. I bought Wicked about a year ago and have enjoyed it off and on. There were a few tracks I just bothered to listen to today, so I figured it was safe to review it now. <br /> <br /> Let me get my main complaint out of the way first: The lyrics in 'Wicked' range from clever on the level of Stephen Sondheim (\\"Popular,\\" one of Glinda's key songs: 'It's not about aptitude/It's the way you're viewed/So it's very shrewd to be/Very, very popular, like me!') to deserving of ridicule (\\"Thank Goodness,\\" another of Glinda's numbers: 'They couldn't be goodlier!' Also \\"What is This Feeling?\\" in which the chorus sings: 'She's a terror, she's a tartar/We don't mean to show a bias...Poor Galinda, forced to reside/With someone so disgusticified). Stephen Schwartz seems to have been half-hearted with half of his material. But I can praise 'Popular' endlessly for it's coy melody mixed with insanely witty lyrics. <br /> <br /> So Stephen Schwartz has a tendency to make up words. So sue him -- he can only write one clever song per musical. That doesn't matter, he's got some fantastic melodies. Schwartz' ability as a composer comes out if you stop paying attention to his elementary-level lyrics, he's a fantastic composer: The tunes to \\"As Long As You're Mine,\\" \\"For Good,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"Thank Goodness\\" are all commendable. <br /><br /> The booklet that comes with the disc has some nice color photos with brief descriptions of the scenes, a list of who signs what song, a cast list, a foreword by Gregory Maguire, author of the original book \\"Wicked,\\" and the lyrics to all the songs -- not quite a synopsis, but still helpful. <br /> <br /> Making use of Schwartz' hit-and-miss material are two excellent leads: The can't-knock-her Idina Menzel, whose Broadway celebrity now defies gravity, and Kristen Chenoweth, who skyrocketed to Broadway stardom with 'Wicked.' The supporting cast is mostly passable but no one truly stands out. <br /> <br /> Is it worth buying? Yeah, sure, if for no other reason than seeing what the hype is about and to own the songs \\"Popular\\" and \\"Defying Gravity.\\" Maybe a few songs will stand out to you, like they do to me. But overall, judging strictly by the music, Wicked in no way at all deserved that Tony it's fans claim it was snubbed. <br /> <br /> - Alex Knepper, July 7th

B00004ZD69|5.0|Godspeed you black emperors second full-length album is a double disc set that clocks in at over 60 minutes while containing only four true instrumental tracks.  Lift your skinny fists like antennas to heaven brings the band to a whole new depth in structure and composition.  While the trade mark sound is still evident, the songs on this particular album seem to all work with each other to form a series of movements not unlike a symphony.  The rise and fall of the guitars, cello, and violins swelling in and out cause an ambient drone wall of sound. <br /> <br />Each song on this album is over 20 minutes in length.  All four tracks though contain from three to seven movements within themselves.  The group comprised of 9 people use multiple guitars and basses, cello, violin and two percussionists to create their ever building epic sound. Adding to the transitions of the music they fade in and out sound recordings of random people and urban noise that feels like spoken word propaganda. <br />The album after many listens could almost be compared to the way a storm builds and then settles. Each song starts with a slow build over several minutes that eventually swells into an enormous peak and then settles back down to a calm floating sound. The most impressive part of their musical compositions is the fact that they use no lyrics or vocals but yet still convey intense emotion. This is by far the group's strongest release and is highly recommended. <br />
B0000VD04M|4.0|So many Tim Burton movies have great ideas and beautiful visuals, but somehow go a little flat in the telling.  For example, BIG FISH had some great things to look at, along with a some fun performances...but in the end it was too pleased with itself to make an emotional impact and the ending was muddled.  BATMAN was a visual and acting delight as well, but had absolutely no suspense because the action sequences were dull...it was clearly not what interested Burton, but it meant the movie never got the pulse racing.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, with another quirky Johnny Depp performance, again never achieved any real suspense because it was too busy dwelling on cool sets and sweeping camera angles.  Burton is the master of visual flair, but he sometimes lets the \\"fun\\" of a good story get forgotten in all the fussiness. <br /> <br />ED WOOD, I'm very happy to say, does not fall into this trap.  It's one of his best two or three films (I'm thinking EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and the new CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY belong up there too.)  He's got the help of telling a story packed with off-the-wall (but real) characters, just like he loves.  Ed Wood, universally acknowledged as the worst director ever, is brilliantly played by Depp.  He brings an ebullience to the part, a joyful cluelessness, that really makes it work, and explains how Wood didn't quite get the fact that he had NO TALENT! <br /> <br />We basically follow Wood and his troupe through the making of his three \\"greatest\\" films...GLEN OR GLENDA, BRIDE OF THE MONSTER and PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  We see how Wood attracted investors, how every scene only needed to be shot once, because it was \\"perfect\\" and how Wood's personal obsession with cross-dressing and Angora sweaters affected his \\"art.\\"  But mostly we see his funny and very touching relationship with Bela Lugosi, a sad old man passed the end of his career and near the end of his life. <br /> <br />Unlike so many Burton films, we actually feel real pain and emotionfrom the brilliant Martin Landau as Lugosi.  His pain at being a \\"has-been\\" and a drug addict is palpable.  His thick Hungarian accent drips with the pain and the self-awareness.  Lugosi is enfeebled, but his mind is always lively enough to appreciate what a wretch he has become.  Wood is just so thrilled to be close to a \\"star\\" that he creates the most ludicrous dialogue and characters for Lugosi...but eventually we see that Wood truly sees Lugosi as a friend too.  A hero.  Their scenes together are always interesting...and Landau steals every moment of the film he's in.  His Oscar win was richly deserved. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of Woods' bad movies, you'll really like the incredibly faithful reproductions of scenes from his films, particularly PLAN 9.  It's obvious that while Burton, Depp and the rest certainly realize how bad the movies were, they also understand how making those films was a small break from the sad realities of life for the crew that made them.   <br /> <br />As I said...Depp is very good in the film.  He's a huge bundle of energy and vocal tics.  His head is constantly nodding and shaking at the same time, as he's forced to compromise this \\"ideals\\" again and again and again.  I've heard it suggested that he should have been nominated for an Oscar for the part...but as much as I like him in the role, I can't quite agree.  It's a very mannered performance...trying to be realistic and also evoke some of the bad acting of the films that Woods made.  In later life, Woods became a big alcoholic and the maker of soft-core adult movies.  He obviously had a dark side, but Depp has pretty much chosen to leave that out.  It's not a BAD choice, but it limits our connection with Woods as a real person just a little. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is very good. Bill Murray is droll, and also has the single best line in the movie.  That line is the word  \\"Sure.\\"  You'll have to see the film to get it, but you'll know just what I mean.  Sarah Jessica Parker and Patricia Arquette are quite fine.   <br /> <br />The film, in lovely black and white, is a humdinger.  It's rated \\"R\\" for some outbursts of very coarse language (pretty much from Lugosi) which are very funny, but in general, the movie is not for kids.  And if you can possibly see PLAN 9 before ED WOOD, I would recommend it.  It gives you all the context you need!  Enjoy!!! <br />

B0007XT87G|4.0|After having released their major-label debut \\"In Absentia\\", Porcupine Tree happened to receive major accolade from both fans of the earlier days of the group and which attracted more new listeners as well, like me. \\"In Absentia\\" was a brillant progressive rock/metal hybrid that featured intelligent songwriting, a great blend of hard rock and soft elements while remaining inventive and memorable. So, it is safe to say that Steven Wilson and company took their time crafting the follow-up album, which is Deadwing. <br /> <br />Deadwing had received rather mixed reviews so far, some people thought that Porcupine Tree went soft and released a by-the-number rock album or some even linked Porcupine Tree to nu-metal esthetics (blasphemy!). Well, rest assured that Deadwing is nothing like this. Like all other PT releases so far, it's chock-filled with ideas and intriguing textures that can only be noticed on repeated listens. The clear thing about Deadwing is that it's not as accessible than \\"In Absentia\\" so don't let your first listen make your final opinion of the album.  <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree still show off their progressive influences aplenty on the album, with the opening title track delivering crushing riffs amongst an eerie, repeating keyboard figure. The song has no traditional structure, jumping from one part to the other in an arbitrary way, never repeating lyrics at all (the song also incorporates lyrics from none other than Opeth's frontman Mikael Akerfeldt, by the way). The song also features an rather tense part in the middle where the instrumentation gets really sparse with the dark keyboard riffs carrying the tune on it's own before the other instruments slowly force their way back in before launching into a spastic, howling guitar solo. <br /> <br />\\"Arriving Somewhere but Not Here\\" is Porcupine Tree at it's most progressive, clocking over 12 minutes, featuring a lot of parts and psychedelia galore. This would be easily a track to send over to Porcupine Tree newbies in order to initiate them to this incredible band as it contains all the band's trademarks: interesting textures and structures, soft and mellow parts combined with bone-shattering drums and riffs at the same time. <br /> <br />\\"Halo\\" is a incredibly catchy bass-driven song with a memorable chorus and which happens to critise people that allow vices of our society to happen by linking their ways of action to God (\\"God is in the trigger, God is in the lead\\" and \\"God gives meaning, God gives pain\\"). \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" (which oddly don't feature any Mellotron playing) is one of the softer moments of the album, featuring a clunky, sparse beat playing over soft melodies and incredible vocal harmonies through the chorus and the outro. The ending of the tune really gives me the chills. \\"Lazarus\\" is radio-friendly maybe, but damn isn't this song gorgeous nonetheless. A definite warm song where Wilson's lyrics just shine through their fragility and beauty. <br /> <br />However, the album also has it's share of letdowns, albeit minor. \\"Shallow\\" is pretty much what the title says. It had been labelled by the band itself as a big dumb rock song. While it's countless times better than the tripe hearing on radio these days, this is a track that just finds itself below Porcupine Tree's standards and feels like an open bid for radio-playing. \\"Open Car\\" shares a similar fate, featuring a rather plain guitar riff as it's main structure. The part-acoustic, part-rock chorus  cranks the song up a notch, but in the end \\"Open Car\\" just isn't very interesting. \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" is a pretty, although rather aimless closer that only feature some moments of brillance  toward the ending. <br /> <br />In the end, Deadwing is an uneven album, yet it is a satisfying one that will justly reward those who dedicate enough listening time and attention to it. Porcupine Tree doesn't break new ground with this album, but they continue to solidify their song structures and songwriting abilities. They seem to become more confident with their newly-found heavy side and are as capable than before to merge styles and create something which can't be classified (labelling PT as a prog-rock or metal band is lazy and doesn't do justice to these guys). After close to 15 years and 8 full-length albums, Deadwing is another great notch for this intriguing and still growing band. <br /> <br />Oh, and do yourself a favor and see these guys live. I've managed to see them live in Qubec lately, they put on an awesome show that night. You really haven't lived in you didn't see them perform \\"Trains\\" from \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Lazarus\\", \\"Deadwing\\" and \\"Halo\\". That was breathtaking and a definitely unique experience.
0670033375|3.0|Diamond's _Guns, Germs and Steel_ and his earlier _Third Chimpanzee_ were both masterpieces of popular science writing: they brought home truths unfamiliar or not-fully-accepted even to people who followed science, and did so in a manner that was brisk and readable without seeming _too_ brisk. <br /> <br />_Collapse_ is not brisk. And it's message, while perhaps far more important that the message of the earlier books, is not news. There are interesting bits: the stuff about the struggles in Montana amongst miners, ranchers and newcomers is well-observed and surprisingly balanced. <br /> <br />But other parts of the story drag: for instance, do any general readers need to know this much about precisely how the Easter Island ecology was depleted? One begins to lose patience with the theme with only the second illustrative case of environmental collapse in the book! <br /> <br />The fascinating question for me is NOT whether environmental collapse is possible or precedented or whether we may be headed for it (I'll give my assent to all three propositions, and Diamond will win over few deniers regardless of how voluminously he writes on the subject).  <br /> <br />The question I find fascinating is the one touched upon in the Montana story. Here we have a bunch of people, all of whom have understandable motives for what they are doing, who are collectively destroying their environment. <br /> <br />Diamond's thesis emphasizes the cultural factors that have led to collapse in the past. What I wonder is whether we aren't more or less doomed to destroy and over-exploit our surroundings if left to our own individualistic devices. In other words I wonder if the \\"invisible hand\\" of capitalism inevitably leads us to use up all we can lay our hands on. In the 18th century one of the first capitalistic thinkers (Mandeville) argued that individual vice providentially represented a collective benefit. In the 21st, that is no longer true. Perhaps the only solution to our long-termenvironmental problems is a solution imposed from above, autocratically. <br /> <br />One of the great advantages of technology is that I think this sort of solution would be do-able. Society could be compelled to do other than what individualistic economic sense drove them toward. Not a pleasant thought, but more pleasant than some of the options we see in Diamond's book. <br /> <br />_Collapse_ is thought provoking, but not as good a read as his earlier works, and not at all as challenging.  <br /> <br />OPK

Yes I would do that first. Then.....um....I'd probably change the language and add subtitles so I could be sure to not let insipid dialogue get in the way. This would also mask the poorly written script. Now what else would I do......I'd probably change the location to Japan and add the unique cultural aspect to help reinforce the esscense of the story.

B0001MDP3G|4.0|Cold Mountain is the story of love, hardships, and about one man travelling hundreds of miles to return to the one woman who he loves dearly... <br /> <br />Jude Law stars as Inman, a man who was a confederate soldier during the Civil War. After witnessing too much death and despair, he realizes that he does not believe in the war and what the South is fighting for. After recieving three letters from the woman he left behind, named Ada, he decides to desert the war and sets off on an adventerous quest to come to the aid of Ada, who is facing lots of hardships. <br /> <br />Jude Law's character was well done. He portrayed a man who is good natured in his heart and does the right thing after seeing so many cruel people in the world... <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman stars as Ada, a young woman who leaves the busy Northern cities to come down to the quiet town of Cold Mountain. Despite knowing how to cook and mend clothes, she faces extreme hardships after her father dies of old age and she is left in this huge farm all by herself. While I did like how she portrayed Ada, I thought she was rather old to be exactly like her. [But besides that I thought Kidman did a fantastic job.] <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger costars as Ruby. A sort of Tom boyish girl, who shows up on Ada's doorstep asking for a job in exchange for food and a place to sleep. I also thought Zellweger was good, as she plays a woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind and does what she wants. Both Ada and Ruby made a great team. <br /> <br />As I said in the title, the book is just a little bit better, going into more detail about the adventures of Inman. From meeting a preacher who was going to kill a slave girl because she was carrying his child, to a young woman whose alone in a cabin with a pig as her only food source. [In the book she didn't kill the pig because she was afraid she couldn't do it.]  <br /> <br />Although some of the movie is twisted into a new Hollywood style [Another example would have to bethe start of the movie compared to the book, as the book starts with Inman in the hospital and his conversation with the blind man much longer.] I found the movie entertaining and the romance between Inman and Ada believable.  <br /> <br />Once last thing was that in the book, Cold Mountain was about the Mountain that Inman always looked for because he knew Ada was on the other side, waiting. I thought the movie did not dwell into how important the mountain was for Inman in the movie as much as it could. <br /> <br />Other characters add to the drama and emotion [The Home Guard and Ruby's father are perfect examples.] and many great action moments [Although the battle at the beginning might not be suitable for all children if you are watching with the kids. Plus there is some nudity, but besides that this movie is a solid remake of the book, and definately should be viewed at least once.

This DVD tops them (and that's saying a lot, because the others I own are high quality and energetic).  This is one of the best live DVDs I own.  A lot of songs and the musicians just won't quit, with an amazing energy! <br /> <br />Oh...and just in case that doesn't sell you on this CD, it's Chicago and Earth Wind Fire TOGETHER, playing several songs, BOTH BANDS TOGETHER! <br /> <br />Don't think a second more....ORDER IT!
B000055WIQ|4.0|This is about a riveting supernatural experience that is full of suspense with a corresponding ominous build up. Simply a classic, basically in a realm of its own. I feel the extras are fairly horrible, (I mean that in a 'good' way). <br />       I believe that someone must comment to an extent in it's defense toward certain types of reviews that the Catholic church isn't necessarily the whole 'Christian church' as far as the majority of Protestants are concerned and drownings, burnings at the stake and inquisitional-type tortures were not meant to exorcise away demons as much as gain a confession and/or punishment. How absurd is a theme that is supposedly based on a true story, while embellished with head spinning and buckets of slime, etc., are hardly a recognised psychiatric disorder,(and not intended to give that appearance). Of course this is not the proper place for a discourse on the percieved merits, faults or even past hypocrisy of the Catholic church's practices and I DO NOT want to do a spoiler here in any way, so...just consider something rarely mentioned about this unique movie but rather contoversial at the time- <br />---was the exorcism successful or not?  <br />Still gives shivers-a sheer terror!
B000957O7S|4.0|I have noticed a trend  with will smith movies, mostly every one of them grosses over 100 million in the box office. Is it that Will chooses the right films or is he's hollywood's wonderboy?(Well Friend, can i call you friend? thanks)I am here to tell you that \\"Hitch\\" is a very good romantic comedy and you will enjoy it, especially with your Spouse.    The Premise of \\"Hitch\\" is Alex Hitchens(Will smith) is one of the top if not the top dating consultant in manhattan.If your a dud with your date and you seek alex for help you will be like Fabio after Consulting with Alex.  Then he meets albert(kevin james) who seeks Alex's help to get noticed by a a hot rich, celebrity type woman.  During Alex's time training albert, Alex meets Sara(Eva Mendez) a spunky gossip columnist who puts her defenses up even as alex tries many ways to get her to fall for him.    This movie has 2 stories, you see the hilarious ways that Alex and Albert interact during their times together as Alex teaches albert how to dance, kiss, be suave, cool, be a ladies man and a overall good date to try to catch the attention of the rich woman. And you see Alex who for other people is a good advice giver but for his own love life he can't seem to do anything right.    Kevin james plays a great supporting role alongside Will smith,As his On-Screen Chemistry with Will is top notch and Eva Mendez plays a very spunky hard to catch Female and i see Eva playing more roles like this in the future.      The Comedy-\\"Hitch\\" delivers different types of comedy here, you get some \\"laugh at white man trying to be hip\\" comedy, some bad allergy reaction comedy, some Accidental hit comedy and in this movie you get very smart punchlines which are funny as well.      The only negatives about \\"Hitch\\" is there are sometimes the movie can drag a little especially during the ending BUT this movies humour and charm comes through to pick it right up.And sometimes the movie can get a little over-dramatic but nothing too bad.    Hitch is a Very Smartly written movie, it kind of feels like your watching a \\"Dating for Dummies\\" movie with all the tips you get from Alex but it's one of my favorite for 2005.    Conclusion-Atleast Rent \\"Hitch\\" and see if you like it(which you probably will) and if you liked it, then purchase it or whatever you want.      Positives  +smart written script  +Good on-screen chemistry between Kevin and Will  +some hilarious moments  +Will Smith at his best    Negatives  -Lagging moments at times  -Over-dramatized lines  -sappy ending    DVD bonus features:    3 deleted scenes   Blooper reel   \\"Dance Steps Made Easy\\" featurette   \\"Hitch Style\\" featurette   \\"The Dating Experts\\" featurette   \\"Love in New York\\" featurette   \\"Will Smith's Red Carpet Ride\\" featurette   \\"1 Thing\\" music video by Amerie    4 stars out of 5!

B0000027RL|5.0|Seriously, do you have a life? All you ever do is bash great talented bands with bad reviews and praise MTV-friendly generic garbage just like that other blonde blue eyed s***bag Fred Dursts Numba One Fann. Pearl Jam are an awesome band. Eddie Vedder is an awesome vocalist and a good songwriter as well. \\"Jeremy\\", \\"Alive\\", and \\"Evenflow\\" are three of the best songs on this album, and they're still being played on rock radio stations to this day forward. Creed just flat out suck, and I'm glad they broke up. Seriously go drink some napalm, and let us listen to what we want.<br /><br />Now as for the album, I don't own it yet, but I've heard samples of it, especially \\"Alive\\", \\"Jeremy\\", and \\"Evenflow\\" which I mentioned are three of the best songs on this album, and I like what I've heard. I'll give you the full review when I get this.
B0000025JT|5.0|I can't wait for the Dual Disc of this cd! This is a classic pop album, and a classic from Streisand! She worked with the Bee Gees on this album, who produced and wrote the album. Two of the songs were duets with Barry Gibb. That includes the title track which was a big hit, and the ballad \\"What Kind of Fool\\", which was a #1 on AC. The biggest hit though was the first single, \\"Woman In Love\\", one of her biggest and best hits ever. The rest of the album is just as good, with nice ballads like \\"The Love Inside\\", as well as other pop songs like \\"Run Wild\\", \\"Promises\\" and \\"Life Story\\". The album closes with a 7 minute ballad called \\"Make It Like A Memory\\". Barry Gibb and Streisand have reunited for a new album due in September 2005, and the Dual Disc of this album comes out August 23 2005!
B00005JNSK|5.0|Absolutely awesome. I have been waiting for this since they announced that Nicholas Cage would play the part of Willy Wonka. But, I'm much happier that they went went with Johnny Depp. <br />This movie is more faithful to the book than the original 1971 movie. It is not a musical exactly but, the Oompa Loompas do sing everytime one of the four children do something wrong. This <br />film is destined to be a \\"one-liner\\" film. The movie has some of the funniest lines you've ever heard and much more hilarious situations than the original. <br /> <br />If you don't like Tim Burton, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. Tim & Johnny is a match made in Heaven, as well as all of the other movies they've made together. <br /> <br />The entire audience was cheering at the end...as was I.
B00005Q4CS|1.0|I saw this film a while ago, and still have nothing good to say about it.  I almost didn't bother even watching the whole thing, it had me yawning.  The music is repetitive and annoying.  The focus was on the character's downward spiral thanks to drug use, and didn't accomplish portraying the tragedy that is the death of dreams well at all. The characters failed to move me.  It seemed to me they never had anything going for them to begin with, and thus not really anything to lose.  It just seems like a film you'd show someone to scare them away from drug use.
B000003TA4|1.0|What's up with Nirvana?  I don't get it.  Not a single shrieking, whammy-bar afflicted guitar solo.  No operatic metal vocals.  Sorely lacking in their repertoire of songs relating food items to female reproductive organs.  No super-model girlfriends.  I don't think Curt Koburn's guitar was outfitted with a Floyd Rose system or a locking nut.  Christ Novorselack didn't play a Warlock bass, and Dade Growl never broke for extended drum solos (although he had an awesome last name).  And, as far as I know, that untalented hack Kurk Coblain never even used hairspray (!).  They never had a video with Tawny Kitaen doing cartwheels across luxury European automobiles.  Seriously, not a single one.  Shocking, I know.    These guys killed real rock!  You know, since real rock music requires a metric ton of makeup and hair accessories after all.  Just like Buddy Holly, Chuck Berry, and Elvis Presely envisioned it.    All kidding aside, I'm a musician and I like Nirvana.  Plus, I don't suck if I say so myself.  I use the solo from \\"Another Brick In The Wall Pt. II\\" to warm up, for one.  Nirvana's music couldn't be easier to play, but it doesn't change what I think about them.  I love Nirvana because I'll be damned if Dokken, Malmsteen, Whitesnake, Vai, Satch, Cinderella, or Twisted Sister ever excited me the way Nirvana did.  If they're so worthless, how come blowhards like Vince Neil hate them to this day?  I bet a lot of the hair metallers were probably just bitter about the fact that a visceral, powerful (ie \\"real\\") rock band was causing them to lose money that would normally be going straight up their noses.  Wow, what a shame.    Oh, I almost forgot.  \\"Nevermind\\" is a great album.  There, that's my review.
B000002549|4.0|At this time in her career, she was pushing boundaries, and basically recording various albums that represented many styles. It just goes to show her talent, as she showed her diversity as an artist. She sounds beautiful, her voice is crystal clear and as difficult as it is to sing opera, she makes it sound like it comes naturally for her. She sings songs composed by Schumann, Debussy, Handel, and others and sung in French, German, Latin, Italian, and English.

B000002IOJ|3.0|Testament is a very talented band, and while I think the songs on this recording are great, it does have some major flaws.  The recording sounds very flat, which robs this band of much of it's energy.  There's very little variance in dynamic, and the mix lacks richness. Unfortunately a lot of metal bands don't exactly have great production. <br />Still the songs on this CD are quite good, I am especially fond of The Ballad.
0393057658|5.0|Where does one start with the excellence of this book.  From the stories of Billy Beane's playing days in the minors with Lenny Dykstra (the dude) to the inside view of a MLB draft and the role of a GM of a team at the deadline in July.  This book delivers like no other, with one chapter after another, one subject after another, with no let up in interest or intensity. <br />Fascinating is the info on Bill James and baseball statistics and the engaging stories about Chad Bradford and Scott Hatteberg, and other Moneyballers.

B0007Z4S4C|4.0|\\"Mighty Rearranger\\" has that close-miked, stripped-down electric sound that seems to be increasingly popular in the studio (the Jon Butler Trio's latest CD comes to mind as another example).  It doesn't bash you over the head with a wall of sound - it worms its way into your psyche instead.  Mr. Plant doesn't have the pipes he once did (actually, he sounds better than he has in years), but he makes the most of what he's got with an impassioned delivery that's almost as impressive as his Zep days.  The instrumentation is key, here, too - it evokes the old Led Zeppelin better than virtually anything previously heard in Plant's solo work.  Guitarist Justin Adams, in particular, fills Jimmy Page's shoes rather admirably.  There are echoes of \\"IV\\" and \\"Physical Graffiti\\" all over the place, yet it's not \\"Zep Part Deux\\" - it has its own character, and doesn't fall back on hard-rock nostalgia.  Still, Plant's musical traditions are evident: the Middle Eastern rhythms and modalities that made songs like \\"Kashmir\\" rock classics; some lovely, folky moments (\\"All the King's Horses\\"); a nod or two to the blues, and songs like \\"Somebody Knocking\\" that successfully blend all three of those influences.   The \\"hidden\\" track, a radical remix of \\"Shine It All Around\\", is not such a strange choice considering the current popularity of remix projects.  All this adds up to a recording that acknowledges its personal and musical history, yet feels fresh and adventurous.  It's one of the best releases so far this year.
B00005JNSK|5.0|\\"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory\\" is impressive! Johnny Depp is eccentricly brilliant as Willy Wonka and Freddie Highmore is an impressive Charlie Bucket. Tim Burton's directing is excellent. The visual effects are impressive and Oscar-worthy. The screenplay by John August, based on the novel by Roald Dahl, is excellent. The music by Danny Elfman is excellent and stays with you even after the movie is over. The cinematography by Philippe Rousselot is excellent and remarkable. The film editing by Chris Lebenzon is excellent. The casting by Susie Figgis is excellent. The production design by Alex McDowell is impressive and a feast for the eyes. It is also Oscar-worthy, as well. The art direction by Francois Audouy, Sean Haworth, James Lewis, Andy Nicholson, Kevin Phipps (senior art director), Stuart Rose, and Leslie Tomkins is also impressive and a feast for the eyes and is Oscar-worthy, as well. The set decoration by Peter Young is just as impressive and is also a feast for the eyes and is also Oscar-worthy, as well. The costume design (Oscar nominated) by Gabriella Pescucci is excellent. This is one of the year's best! It is also an excellent remake to the original \\"Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory\\" (1971), as well.
B0001611DI|5.0|If there was one thing Romero could've done after making Night of the Living Dead to make himself a totally awsome person, that would be making a sequel.  This sequel continues the story of the Earth and it's little problem.  Dead people are coming back to life and eating living human flesh.  If a person is bitten, their process to being turned into a zombie is drasticly sped up.  4 people manage to escape a populated city (VERY SMART IDEA) and take refuge in a deserted mall, well, deserted by all living beings.  This is drama in it's highest form, accompanied by horror, which is equally great.  I still prefer the awsomness of Night of the Living dead to this, and the gore in Day of the Dead (but not the rest of the movie) but people are right when they say this is the best movie in the series, I just don't agree.  I advise everyone to see this, and the makeup is from 1978, so shut up.  I must say though, avoid the Dawn of the Dead remake AT ALL COSTS!  It's terrible and a disgrace.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When I first heard it back in 1997, I didn't even know what to make of it.  It was the strangest thing I'd ever heard. <br /> <br />At the time, I was still coming out of my Nirvana phase (Yes, even 4 years after Kurt Cobain's death), and would have been pleased to listen to grunge for the rest of my life.  This album changed all that. <br /> <br />It changed the way I looked at music.  It showed me just how beautiful it could be.  Yes, it can be a downer at times, but that's simply because of how potent it is, it changes your mood no matter what. <br /> <br />Its got a very unified theme that goes brilliantly with the stark white and blue cover, belying the fear, anger, sadness, and love contained inside.   <br /> <br />Paranoid Android and Electioneering in particular still, to this day, make the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end. <br /> <br />Before I got my Ipod, it had the longest reign in my regular cd rotation than any other cd I owned.  Now that I have my Ipod, I may not listen to it quite as often, but it's got much more impact because of that. <br /> <br />I even bought it again after I thought I lost it.  It turned out that I didn't loose it, so now I've got two copies, but that doesn't disappoint me in the least.  And if I could part with one of them and take it to the used cd store, it would be sold before I left. <br /> <br />In short, just buy it.  You won't regret it.

B00097A5I6|4.0|1990's rock has been coming back with a vengeance this year.  The 2000's saw Hip Hop gaining market prominence even among suburbanites.  Nonetheless, much like disco in the late 1970's, once Hip Hop acts appeared on the front of Rolling Stone one knew the Western world would be moving on.  However much you like music videos with young women in bikinis dancing around swimming pools while the singer turns out crafty rhymes, after a while it sinks in these guys are just Hugh Heffner wannabes and/or these \\"gangsters\\" wouldn't last five minutes in downtown Baghdad.  Nothing against the \\"bad boys\\"; but they pale against the marines who took Falujah in lethalness.  This is one case where reality wins out.  For some reason when war or national tragedy rears its ugly head rock returns to center stage.<br /><br />Not that Oasis has been away.  With their first album, DEFINITELY MAYBE, Oasis caught the favorable attention of an assortment of critics and tastemakers.  Then in 1995, Oasis released their magnum opus in WHAT'S THE STORY MORNING GLORY.  So powerful was WTSMG that it remains one of the very best albums of that decade.  It was then the Gallaghers' strong affinity for the Beatles became apparent.  Not only did Oasis employ musical \\"Beatle-isms\\", their worldview recalled the latter idealism of the Fab Four and in pattern and feel WTSMG roughly resembled SGT. PEPPER.  It also didn't hurt that WTSMG was a GUITAR album.  Instead of being vilified as copycats, Oasis enjoyed a royal honeymoon with critics and public alike..<br /><br />Then Oasis began a series of missteps.  Press members were abused during interviews.  Legendary fights on jet flights got them banned from several carriers.  The Gallagher brothers publicly fought with each other.  Liam, the lead singer, walked out on the band at the beginning of a major U.S. tour-leaving the less capable Noel to carry the vocal chores for the rest of those dates.  Band members either left the band or were fired.  They pissed off George Harrison.  Then came the major mistake of BE HERE NOW.<br /><br />In all fairness, nothing Oasis could have done could have stood next to WTSMG.  But BHN suffered from alcohol and drug over-indulgence that manifested itself in all the dials thrown to the max and overblown delusions of grandeur.  It was like a badly intoxicated drunk deciding to take on Mohammed Ali in his prime.  Oasis simply got knocked to the floor.  The once darlings of the rock glitterati got themselves banished to obscurity.<br /><br />Cleaned up and dried out, Oasis picked themselves up and released one decent album, a collection of non-album cuts, and an excellent \\"live\\" record-all of which were ignored.  This began to change with HEATHEN CHEMISTRY.  The band came back with a new confidence and aggressiveness that recalled their early days.  That renewed spirit has put itself on the forefront of DON'T BELIEVE THE TRUTH.<br /><br />As Zak Starkey remarks, Oasis is a hard working band that is in the studio early and leaves late with little in the way of breaks.  You don't find a band wondering what to do next and holding a wetted finger to see which way the wind is blowing.  The Gallaghers are holding to the original vision and they've got something to say whether the world listens or not.<br /><br />After first listening to DBTT., what struck me was the album's unusual structure:  three song cycles three songs each; with two songs at the end that can be taken by themselves.  Whether by design or accident, it is beneficial to recognize these song cycles as such because several of the songs end oddly unless you understand that musically you are being lead to the next song.<br /><br />\\"Turn Up The Sun\\"/\\"Mucky Fingers\\"'/Lyla starts off with no introduction right into the fray.  \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" is a complex song combining both a pleasant soft minor key progression with a hard edge plea of love and brotherhood.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" and \\"Lyla\\" by contrast are garage band thrashings like a constant hammer.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" recalls a HIGHWAY 61/BLONDE ON BLONDE era Dylan sneer commonly believed truths.  \\"Lyla\\" by contrast brings the Kinks to mind as an appeal to the universal feminine spirit of love.<br /><br />\\"Love like a Bomb\\"/\\" The Importance of Being Idle\\"/\\"The Meaning of the Soul\\" form a humorous trio joking at different levels.  \\"Love like a Bomb\\" is a largely acoustic song at heart which compares/contrasts love with exploding munitions.  \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" appears to be one of Oasis' nonsense songs with the singer completely unconcerned with the necessities of life.  (It could also be a wry reminder not to confuse living with acquiring the requirements to live.)  \\"The Meaning of the Soul\\" is the \\"flip\\" side of \\"Importance\\". The singer romances his love in a rapid almost machine cadence with the ironic promise to teach her about \\"soul\\".<br /><br />\\"Guess God Thinks I'm Able\\"/\\"Part Of The Queue\\"/\\"Keep The Dream Alive\\"  returns to the themes of the first song cycle.  \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Able\\" is as lovely an acoustic ballad Oasis has ever recorded.  Lyrically it lays out choices in love and hate.  \\"Guess God\\" ends oddly sliding into \\"Part of the Queue\\"-marking the spiritlessness modern life.  The triad ends with \\"Keep the Dream Alive\\"-- a dreamy anthem march for peace and love.<br /><br />The album ends with two songs that hang on like fillers.  \\"A Bell Will Ring\\" harks back to the Beatles' \\"Rain\\"; while \\"Let There Be Love\\" begins with that lonely hollow piano sound John Lennon used in his early solo career that suddenly evolves into an \\"All You Need Is Love\\" chorus faithfully equipped with slow drums and synth washes.  Unfortunately, they do have a \\"tacked on\\" air about them.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good album that holds up under repeated listenings.  I am not prepared to say this CD is essential the way WTSMG is and was.  But it is far more interesting than 95% of other releases this year.are garage band thrashings like a constant hammer.  \\"Mucky Fingers\\" recalls a HIGHWAY 61/BLONDE ON BLONDE era Dylan sneer commonly believed truths.  \\"Lyla\\" by contrast brings the Kinks to mind as an appeal to the universal feminine spirit of love. <br /> <br />\\"Love like a Bomb\\"/\\" The Importance of Being Idle\\"/\\"The Meaning of the Soul\\" form a humorous trio joking at different levels.  \\"Love like a Bomb\\" is a largely acoustic song at heart which compares/contrasts love with exploding munitions.  \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\" appears to be one of Oasis' nonsense songs with the singer completely unconcerned with the necessities of life.

0156027321|5.0|A post-modern masterpiece of faith, hope, love, friendship, and adventure featuring Pi Patel, a 16 year old Indian boy adrift in a lifeboat with a 450 pound Bengal tiger and a small menagerie of expatriated zoo animals. Almost impossible to put down, I found myself turning page after page well into the night. Life of Pi is well written with each chapter finely honed to razor sharpness. Although absolutely unique, I found it to be reminiscent of a tasty dish prepared with ingredients from Moby Dick, Robinson Crusoe, The Old Man and the Sea, Calvin and Hobbes, and the Voyage of Saint Brendan; and liberally spiced with the Koran, the Upanishads, and the Bible. Martel's characters are well constructed, all very real and believable. And the ending has just enough of a twist to be quietly troubling to the soul (but only if you have trouble believing in miracles). It is an enchanting story, to be sure, but author Matrel forewarns his readers that this is a \\"story that will make you believe in God.\\"
B00005JNSK|1.0|I was anticipating the release of CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY for months!  I mean the combination of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp is usualy cinematic greatness...  not to mention, this movie came out the day before my brithday AND was said to be the last great box office money-maker this summer.   <br />I saw this movie on opening day, with a huge audience!  I was expecting a dark, yet slightly comedic movie - along the lines of LIMINY SNICKET or HARRY POTTER. I was impressed by the creepiness of the grandparents, the honesty of Freddie Highmore's performance, and the hard-working Oompa Loompas (considering that they used one actor to do all the Oompa Loompa moves, I figured he was the hardest working one in the movie).  There is no mystery to Willy Wonka - he reminds me of a cross between Michael Jackson, Mickey Mouse, and The Cat In The hat.  I didn't find Johnny Depp's performance believable. The kids playing Veruka Salt and Mike TV are forgetable. The girl playing Violet & the lady who played her mom seem like Barbie dolls with beauxtox (more perfect than perfect)...but the supposedly \\"bad kids\\" in the movie gave me the impression that it was just an image they were putting on.I was unmoved by any of the movie's comedic attempts.  The ending, I thought, was an even bigger let-down than everything else in the movie.   <br />What I was impressed with, besides the guy acting as all of the Oompa Loompas, was the parents of Mike TV (they seemed as if they'd been ravaged by years of watching TV and that it had worn them down and stripped them of their souls).  I also liked the score, but I felt like the 'kiddie' songs that Danny Elfman wrote, are very forgetable.  I don't see this movie as being one that will hold its own for generations to come, as the original will.
B000001Y42|5.0|Aah, what a terrible fate Limp Bizkit has succumb to. I used to have huge respect for these guys (which I still have for members like Wes Borland) before \\"Results May Vary,\\" came out. But despite Limp Bizkit's demise as a group, we can always remember 1997's fantastic, gritty, underproduced, and absolute gem of an album, \\"3 Dollar Bill Y'All.\\"<br /><br />Call them whatever you like - sellouts, losers, morons. It doesn't matter. Sometimes I think we all hop on the bandwagon with other fans just for the hell of it sometimes, but anyway...Limp Bizkit were once a band concerned with music. Not cash or sales or winning support - but real, true music that came from their souls. \\"3 Dollar Bill Y'All,\\" was and still is a great album, with crunching guitars, inspired riffs, anger, sadness and complexity. It had and still has it all. Wes has some really awesome riffs on this particular album that creep into your mind, and mostly you're unaware of his guitar sound. It's just that hypnotic and incredible. The record scratching is masterful and well placed, Fred shouts, screams, raps, sings - just because he wants to, not because he needs more money. The production as aforementioned is very raw but provides a real soulful, deep, resonating sound that gets lost and finally destroyed on later albums.<br /><br />\\"Leech,\\" is an awesomely heavy, grinding riff with some excellent vocal work and killer basslines. \\"Sour,\\" is a funky, groovy and strangely sad song, yet full of anger and hatred. \\"Pollution,\\" begins with talking and Wes playing his guitar, then exploding into an all out barrage of sound. Yes, there was a time when Limp Bizkit were pretty heavy and raw and real, and most fans (or ex-fans) seem to easily forget that. Just because a band turns crappy on 1 or 2 albums doesn't automatically make other awesome albums like this one crap! Come on! That's not a fan, that's a poser who just hangs out with people who force them to think everything they think. Sure, slate me for that if you think that I'm wrong, but at least I'm not a hypocrite.<br /><br />I know this may be a bit out of context, but even Jesus was loved by all in the beginning of his life. But by the end just about everybody hated him, not because they had a reason to hate him, but because everyone else thought it was a good idea to hate him. Maybe you could apply that to Limp Bizkit somehow too. Yes, I'm not a heavily Biblical person, but that is the truth.<br /><br />Whatever you think, Limp Bizkit were real and original once. Maybe they're not anymore, but just because they aren't we shouldn't just bury all their work and term it \\"garbage.\\" But it is true, whether you like it or not, that Limp Bizkit changed the face of Nu-Metal with this album...10/10, no doubt - Y'All!that if you think that I'm wrong, but at least I'm not a hypocrite.  <br /> <br />I know this may be a bit out of context, but even Jesus was loved by all in the beginning of his life. But by the end just about everybody hated him, not because they had a reason to hate him, but because everyone else thought it was a good idea to hate him.

Maybe they're not anymore, but just because they aren't we shouldn't just bury all their work and term it \\"garbage.\\" But it is true, whether you like it or not, that Limp Bizkit changed the face of Nu-Metal with this album...10/10, no doubt - Y'All!
B00080ZG10|2.0|I desperately wanted to like this movie.  In the end, I cam away unsatisfied.<br /><br />Martin Scorcese is an interesting filmmaker.  I would love to rave at his brilliance, but I have always found his movies since the late 80's to be stilted, stylized and extremely violent.<br /><br />Yet, I loved Gangs of New York - perhaps more for the history involved.  The Age of Innocence is simply a lovely and very good movie.  The Aviator is just mediocre.<br /><br />My first impression is that the film crew knew nothing about aviation whatsoever.  In an early scene, Hughes flies the famous H-1 at 350 miles per hour in an open cockpit without goggles. Unless there is direct evidence that this happened, I find it hard to believe.  The CG graphics look very fake to me as well.  The scenes of filming Hells Angels are clearly what I call digital masturbation.  Just not as great as the real thing.  The planes look clearly fake.  The scene where Hughes is filming from the plane seems more incredible then reality.<br /><br />As far as the acting, the actors seem stilted.  I frankly didn't think very much of Cate Blanchet's portrayal of Hepburn.  I know it is a stylized version of Hepburn, but it just didn't grab me.  Alec Baldwin makes Juan Trippe (the founder of the now defunct Pan American, and an incredible and far more important figure in aviation who deserves his own movie) is made out to be a egomaniacal freak by Baldwin.  Baldwin seems to be miscast in Pearl Harbor as Doolittle, and hear he brings a evil patina to Trippe.  Was Trippe evil because he wanted to use everything in his power to stop other airlines?<br /><br />To me DiCaprio seems unconvincing in this role.  He is a very good actor, but this role required someone with a more menacing and rugged personality.  To me, DiCaprio seems like a little kid in this role.  He doesn't even resemble Hughes at all.<br /><br />My other peeve with this movie is the subtle portrayal and foreshadowing of Hughes upcoming mental breakdown - it is a shock - shock! - to see him lose his mind.  NOT.  Here the entry of Hughes social phobia is so thick you would need to be a moron not to see it.  It just distracts from the movie.  Hughes was making decisions and running his business until the mid 70's.  In this movie Hughes seems to become Jekyll - paralyzed by madness one moment, and Hyde in another moment fighting for his business interests or whatever else without any hint of real madness.  Somehow it seems very iffy.  And this film offers no real answers.  For crying out loud, my mother told me about germs and I drink milk, I am not living in a Vegas hotel naked and refusing to cut my nails!!  Can we have some subtle suggestion of why he was so paranoid about disease?  Also, the scene of Hughes as a child with his mother seems to have incestual implications from the suggestive way its filmed. There are other very odd suggestions in this movie as well that I felt really bogged the movie down with a strange quality.  Is Scorcese putting these things here on purpose, or does he not realize they are there through his overly thick eyebrows?  Yeeesh.<br /><br />In short, this movie is worth seeing on several levels.  It is not a bad movie by any means despite my two stars. However, I wouldn't say that beyond some terrific costuming and recreation of scenes in the 30's and 40's will you be given any idea of Hughes contributions to aviation (rivets - that was it Martin? A monoplane?), filmmaking or anything else.  You are left with a lot of thoughts of themes that may or may not be there, undeveloped characters, and a whole lot of weirdness.  For a real descent into weirdness, may I recommend this movie and Howard and Me? I still laugh at the weirdness possible - Howard, would you like my used Kleenex to use?  How about an open bottle of milk?<br /><br />Frankly, the movie made me curious about the real Hughes.  Having seen Hells Angels, it seems Hughes was not such a bad filmmaker.  In fact, Hells Angels is a very entertaing movie! The Outlaw seems tame now, because of Jane Russell's ahem overdeveloped breathing ability, but in the 1940's it was smutty as smutty can be.  I think the movie would have been better if Hughes had been remembering the different episodes of his life all while lying in his bed in Vegas wondering how he ended up there. It would have been a much more effective device for telling a very wothwhile story.  But, hey who am I?  I don't have an American Express commercial nor a constant blather on TCM about letterboxing.  If there is any cosmic justice however, Martin will end up in heaven with Howard blabbering about the tiny tv screens and the lack of letterboxing.  Well, my sick thought, but frankly, you may some sick thoughts too after watching a movie that doesn't live up to the potential of it's very worthwhile subject matter.because of Jane Russell's ahem overdeveloped breathing ability, but in the 1940's it was smutty as smutty can be.

B00007L4MJ|5.0|One of the most important things regarding a remastering of a film onto DVD is that 1) if it is a film, such as Metropolis, that has existed in scratchy and truncated prints for decades, that it becomes completely realized and cleaned up, and 2) the special features are adequate.  This film does both in an exemplary fashion.  I had seen Metropolis before this KINO DVD version, but the print was scratchy, the music wasn't totally appropriate (not the bad 80's rock score, but cheap classical stuff), and the story didn't make much sense.  This time, with the use of intertitles to fill in the story gaps (though, sadly, one wishes to have seen everything), and a finite transfer cleaning up every speck and sratch on the original film negative, it's like seeing a film of today's caliber.  Onlt the criterion DVD's have as high a standard as the Metropolis DVD does, and rightfully so- It's Lang's silent-film masterpiece, and hopefully this DVD will stick around for years and years to come, so future fantasy/sci-fi film fans can come to this and see where almost all of the influence for films in the modern genre came from.  Good job.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|Great live performance, Brian Johnson sounds great, great sound, check out the Live At Donington DVD also, same tour, GREAT stuff, my only complaint, should have played more stuff off of Let There Be Rock and Powerage, but still, killer.
B00003CXCT|2.0|Computer generated imagery looks great in lots of recent movies, but it just looks stupid inserted into 20 year old movies.<br /><br />Editors are supposed to piece together films so that they flow smoothly and create a seamless story.  The CGI additions to this version only remind you that you're watching a movie.  Not only that, but you are reminded that you're watching a movie that's been \\"enhanced\\" twice now.  It just doesn't fit together.<br /><br />I could understand George Lucas' desire to clean up some of the special effects from episodes 4-6.  There were always some scenes that needed work.  Tie fighters with obvious dark squares around them during the death star battle in ep. 4 and the annoying little black \\"slugs\\" noticable on the emperors head in ep. 6 were always annoying.  I would want to fix those too if I were George Lucas.  Unfortunately, he didn't bother fixing the glaring errors like those.  Instead, he decided to change the dialogue and voice acting, added scenes that don't belong, and exchanged good songs for stupid CGI music videos that completely destroy the integrity of the films.  (Dancing bugs singing \\"Rock the Jedi\\" belong in a Disney cartoon, not Return of the Jedi)  I won't even get started on my disappointment at seeing Hayden Christiansen (as Anakin) standing with Yoda and Obi Wan at the end of Ep. 6.  That's too much.<br /><br />I could write a too-long list of reasons to reject this version of The Star Wars Trilogy but the best one is this.  I'm considering throwing away this version and buying a bootleg of the original movie on dvd-r.  Shame on you George Lucas.  You've let your fans down.
0515123447|1.0|It's clear that, since this book has garnered so many rave reviews on Amazon, it appeals to a niche of people that are easily impressed when they read thrillers. But, not to sound condescending, don't read it if you're a serious reader who expects something more than a book written by someone with an eight-year-old's understanding of the world. <br /> <br />I am a big fan of the mystery and noir genre, but I was not able to suspend my disbelief for this book. The hero, Jack Reacher, is basically a perfect human being. The worst part about it is that, even though he is a retired MP and has no authority whatsoever, he somehow manages to take complete control of a police investigation, WITH THE COPS' COOPERATION! The characters were so unbelieveable; as if any real cop would let some yahoo off the street, who was only recently cleared of being a murder suspect, handle their investigation.  <br /> <br />Also, the plot was completely ludicrous, the mystery turning out to be a conspiracy that nearly everyone in town was involved in. I also grew extremely tired of the love affair between Reacher and the female cop Roscoe, who had sex no less than twenty times, in explicit detail. I normally like the main character to have a romantic interest, but Lee Child's incessent descriptions of their sexual exploits did nothing but bog the story down. <br /> <br />I was thoroughly unimpressed with this novel, but I guess it's what you can expect from an British author who clearly has little to no understanding of the American military and legal system. If I could give this book a rating lower than 1 star, I would in a heartbeat.
B0000DIXDR|3.0|Okay, this movie is popular enough that we all pretty much know the storyline, so let's cut to the chase.  While I admittedly like this 80's hit, predictable storyline and all, I can understand why there are people who don't think it's so hot.  Oh, the dancing is excellent, the soundtrack is pretty good, and Patrick Swayze is hot.  What's not so good?  That little snot Jane Brucker has to play, Baby's sister Lisa.  Also, why does the cast all look so 60s, and yet Jennifer Grey has same big 80s hair she wore in all her other films back then?<br /><br />Also, whoever wrote the dialog did a pretty subpar job:<br /><br />Penny Johnson to Baby when she finds out Robbie knows about her pregnancy:  \\"Go back to your playpen...Baby.\\"  It makes me laugh.<br /><br />Kellerman's nephew:  \\"I love to watch your hair blowing in the breeze.\\"  *Snicker.*<br /><br />Lisa:  \\"I don't hear an apology, Robbie!\\"<br /><br />Robbie:  \\"Go back to mommy and daddy, Lisa.  Maybe you'll hear one in your dreams.\\"  *Chortle.\\"<br /><br />Lisa:  \\"Where is my BIEGE...IRREDESCENT...LIPSTICK?\\"  *Aw, shut up, ya primadonna!\\"<br /><br />Johnny:  \\"Nobody puts baby in the corner.\\"  *Histerical laughter ensues.*<br /><br />Okay, so I have a problem with the script, but I really do like this movie occasionally; I just don't love it.  It's good, but too flawed to be a cinematic classic.  And for the love of God, would somebody else notice what a great big bundle of energetic and underrated talent Cynthia Rhodes is?  I found her to be one of the most likable cast members in the film and she fit her part perfectly.  Not only can this girl act, but she can really move!  Jennifer Grey is a good actress, and she plays the young impressionable plain Jane who blossoms under Johnny's mentoring skills to the hilt.  This is a decent movie one gets into the mood for now and then.<br /><br />Now, as for the \\"ultimate DD features,\\" I can tell you right now that the interest level and quality is virtually nonexistent.  Most of the interviews are long and boring, the screen test is okay, and the videos of three of the songs really blow.  They only serve to remind one of just how bad most of the 80s portion of the soundtrack was, particularly that snivelly, whiny theme song that was penned by the equally snivelly, whiny Franke Previte who wrote similar drivel in the early 80's Foreigner wannabe rock group Franke and the Knockouts.  The only truly appreciable feature on this \\"ultimate\\" edition is the thoroughly enjoyable trivia track, but that's on the movie DVD anyway.  This two-disc set is unnecessary, so unless you're nuts about  every single aspect of this movie, my advice is to just go straight for the single DVD and leave this one to the die-hard collectors..

B00000064G|5.0|I was first turned on to Nick Drake by the VW Cabrio commercial from awhile back. I kinda forgot about it after awhile, but the haunting melody definitely stuck with me after all this time and I eventually got around to buying it back in April. All I can say is that it took my breath away... initially some songs more than others... but it is truly one of my most treasured albums in my music library (besides my mass collection of Moody Blues albums). Although all the songs on this album are GORGEOUS, I have picked out my favorites.  <br /> <br />PINK MOON - This song still touches me even after listening to it so many times. The meaning to this song has been interpreted by some as a reference to the apocalypse, since a pink moon in the dark ages symbolizes chaos and destruction (\\"None of you stand so tall, pink moon gonna get you all\\"). Despite the fact it is under 3:00 in length, that truly does not matter. A truly beautiful piece of music. <br /> <br />WHICH WILL - Another beautiful song. Drake's smooth but... undescribable (???) voice is the only voice that could truly pull off this song with the beauty and grace it possesses. Beautiful lyrics which help to contribute to the overall tone of the album... of dreariness and sadness. <br /> <br />ROAD - I absolutely adore this song. The beautiful guitar work in this piece is what really makes it stand out. The opening movement in the guitar grabbed my attention the first time I listened to it, and that's why I consider this among my favorites. Once again... his voice here is perfectly smooth. <br /> <br />FREE RIDE - In comparison to all his other songs on the album, this one (and Pink Moon) are the more lively numbers. His voice gracefully flips through a weave to create a beautiful tapestry of sound. Excellent piece. <br /> <br />FROM THE MORNING - This is the final song on the album. Again, the guitar work is what really grabs my attention. It flows and soothes the listeners ears. Absolutely beautiful. Upon hearingthis song, provides a sense of closure to the album... certainly not a happy closure... but of one that will linger in your thoughts for a very long time. This song seems to close out the beautiful life and career that Nick Drake; we see them flash before us and know that one truly talented individual was lost well before his time. <br /> <br />I own all the albums that are out there by Nick Drake, and I must say this is my favorite. The feeling it instills tends to stick with you for a very long time. All of his recordings are wonderful, but none of them truly grabs the soul and refuses to let go quite like this one. But I recommend anyone who truly appreciates this album to check out all his other albums too. His ballad \\"Northern Sky\\" is absolutely breath-taking also (from Bryter Later) and there are various other gems on his other albums. <br /> <br />Overall, this is an excellent album. If you are looking for something to make you to help create a happy and fun atmosphere... I would not recommend this. But if you truly want to listen and think about your life and experience art and music like no other... this is absolutely an excellent CD. Anyone who truly appreciates beautiful and good music should enjoy this.
B000002H70|5.0|I was never a huge fan of The Cure.  I remember when Disintegration came out and I liked a few songs.  Well, I have reacquainted myself with the band over the past few weeks.  I am angry with myself for not fully appreciating the greatness of this cd many years ago.  There are very few perfect albums out there, but this may be one of them.  The lyrics are wonderful.  Robert Smith's voice is perfect for this music.  The bass, guitar and drums are exactly as they should be.  The lush keyboards help create the entire mood of this cd. <br /> <br />From the beautiful \\"Pictures of You\\" and \\"Lovesong\\" to the more haunting \\"Plainsong\\" and \\"Prayers for Rain\\" to the great \\"Fascination Street;\\" this cd has it all. <br /> <br />Even if you normally do not like this \\"type\\" of music, you will most likely appreciate the beauty of this cd.  I listen to a lot of rock, progressive metal, and I grew up on 80s hard rock.  This cd makes my \\"10 cds to have on a deserted island\\" list.
B000002KKS|3.0|They are NOT Black Sabbath if Ozzy isn't in the band. They should have changed their name. It's not that bad of an album, but nothing at all compared to classic Sabbath. Ozzys vocals were perfect for the type of band they were, dark, heavy and down right scary at times. Dios vocals are neither dark or scary. I was never big on Dio. Too be fair, Ozzy solo wasn't nearly as good as when he was with Sabbath.<br /><br />They really should have changed their name and started fresh as a new band, because Black Sabbath is suppose to be dark and they are suppose to be scary, which is Ozzy and Iommi. Theres nothing scary or dark about Dio.<br /><br />Black Sabbath is  War Pigs, Planet Caravan, Children of the Grave, Sweat Leaf, Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Fluff, Laguna Sunrise, Changes, Black Sabbath, The Wizard, NIB, Iron Man, Supernaut, Symptom of the Universe, Fairies Wear Boots, Hand of Doom, After Forever, Solitude, Snowblind, Warning etc...<br /><br />Don't forget the CLASSIC Black Sabbath!!

B00006M183|5.0|Despite the 2003 tour supporting this album being anything but exciting and looking like this band were a spent force, this album makes up for it. <br /> <br />This is their best album since Vitolagy and a much nicer listen than the last album \\"Binuaral.\\" <br /> <br />If you don't like it at first, give it a few plays, and don't expect it to sound like anything they've done before, because Pearl Jam are a band who (thankgoodness) does'nt repeat itself.

1582403589|3.0|Something about the zeitgest these days has made the lowly zombie newly popular. I can't quite figure out why. I'm sure that more cerebral theorists will say this has to do in some way with the currently triumphant strains of evangelical Christianity and the dominance of the Republican party. Or possibly rap music is to blame. In any case, in your hierarchy of classic monsters (vampires, werewolves, Frankenstein creatures, and mummies), zombies don't even make the A-list. Perhaps this is because your old-school zombies can be stymied by the simple expedient of breaking into a slow jog to get away from them. <br /> <br />Of course, in the last couple of years we've been greeted with the spectacle of buffed-up aerobicized speed zombies in the movies \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" (the remake) and \\"28 Days Later\\". These voracious brain-eaters may not be much for endurance, but they're deadly in the sprint. <br /> <br />This first collection of the ongoing comic book series \\"The Walking Dead\\" does share one plot point with \\"28 Days Later\\": the hero awakens from a coma INTO A WORLD GONE MAD. Which is to say, one where roughly 99.9% of humanity seems to have been either turned into zombies or consumed by them. However, fortunately for him, these are standard-issue slow zombies. And they can easily be dispatched by dealing out traumatic head injuries. But of course, their bites are 100% fatally infectious. And they still slaver for brains. <br /> <br />The present volume is a lot of set-up for what will follow in subsequent collections. We get introduced to our primary cast, and it's rapidly made clear that life in the Zombie States is nasty, brutish, and short. The zombies have nothing but time on their undead hands, so sooner or later one of the survivors will slip up out of terror, stupidity, or carelessness, and then the feast of flesh will commence. <br /> <br />Kirkman is establishing here the conditions in post-disaster America. Where will the survivors get weapons? Food? Gasoline? Where will they find shelter? The cities are packed with zombies and it would be fatal to go more than a block or two into any of them. Can people with few wilderness skills teach themselves to handle guns and to hunt and forage? What happens when people begin pairing off and someone is left out? How do people deal with the still-fresh horror of having seen their loved ones torn limb from limb? And what happens when the toilet paper runs out? <br /> <br />As yet, no explanation for the zombie plague is offered, but these undead seem to be here to stay. The prospects look bleak and the remaining humans are few in number. It looks like Kirkman has an interesting long-term storyline to play out, and it's readily evident that the cast will be ever-evolving and that we'll be following as the action moves from one place to another as our rag-tag band looks for a place to call home. <br /> <br />One thing's for certain, though: zombies really need to work on their conversational skills. While \\"Rrgh\\", \\"Guk\\", and \\"Blargh\\" do serve to get the point across, they really could use a little more eloquence. And improved personal hygiene. Zombies, man...they creep me out.
B000A1ENCU|5.0|\\"Quo Vadis\\" is a great film Directed by Mervyn LeRoy, Starring: Robert Taylor, Deborah Kerr, Leo Genn and Peter Ustinov with splendid cinematography, fabulous sets and costume designs, magnificently photographed by Robert Surtees. \\"An Spectacular True 1950Th's Classic.\\" <br /> <br />This jewel of a movie \\"Quo Vadis\\" whose copyrights are owned by \\"TIME-WARNER INC.\\" it's nonetheless still sitting idle at their MGM/UA Turner Collection's Library without any official restoration on DVD, even when released in 1951, it did became the 2nd highest box office take in \\"Hollywood's Film History.\\" Surpased only by the epic \\"Gone With The Wind.\\" <br /> <br />The restoration should be presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition. But unfortunately right now, only some appalling import copies of it are circulating the internet, selling some for over $35 a piece. <br /> <br />I can't comprehend why Time Warner Home Video have not noticed this problem and take some action to correct this oversight sooner rather than later. So at this point, that \\"The Studio\\" is about to re-issue in September 13, 2005 the \\"Collector's Edition of Ben-Hur.\\" We feel that \\"QUO VADIS,\\" which also was produced by Sam Symbalist, could become a very profitable asset, if only this film that deals with \\"The First Judeo/Christian Holocaust\\" is put on a fast track by Warner Brothers for a late 2005 release in conjunction with the \\"Collector's Edition Ben-Hur.\\" <br /> <br />Ideally along also with two other classic films that are at Warner Brothers Film Library Vault. The first one \\"Land of The Pharaohs\\" by Director Howard Hawks, Starring: Joan Collins and Jack Hawkins (who also starred in \\"Ben-Hur.\\") This film screenplay was done by no other than the great American writer William Faulkner. The second feature is \\"The 4 Horsemen Of The Apocalypse,\\" Directed by Vicente Minnelli, Starring: Glenn Ford, Ingrid Thulin, Charles Boyer, Lee J. Cobb and Paul Heinreid, Co-starring:Paul Lucas, Yvette Mimeux and Karl Boehm. It's a searing drama, in which the Nazi monster set brother against brother following the family's destructive linkup to the sinister horrors of Nazi Germany. A perfect match for another very profitable Warner Brothers DVD release dealing whith this Nazi subject matter: The legendary Luchino Visconti's \\"THE DAMNED.\\" <br /> <br />All these Great Classic films of \\"Hollywood's 1950Th poque\\" should already have been released on anamorphic widescreen or presented in a format preserving the aspect ratio of its original theatrical exhibition on DVD. Unfortunately, perhaps due to an oversight by someone at Time Warner Studios, all of them are still gathering star dust at \\"Warner Brothers Film Library Vault.\\" Without generating any revenues for The Studio or otherwise providing to us some pleasurable joy when we add them to our \\"DVD Home Video Collections.\\" <br /> <br />Can somebody please remind \\"TIME-WARNER INC.\\" that they still got \\"These Three Golden Classic Movies\\" waiting to be released on DVD, which also can be very apropos films for the times we live.
B0000255CL|5.0|At the Heart of Winter; the shiniest gem of Immortal's impressive icy cold catalogue. Mere words truly cannot describe what will be experienced when the play button is pushed for the first time. Since its release in 1999, this CD has remained one of my all time favorite albums.    There is such a juxtaposition of sound when compared to Blizzard Beasts. (Its predecessor) While Blizzard Beasts was fast and raw with short songs, this song ups the ante with long, technical masterpieces, all ranging up in the 8 minute range. Unlike some CD's where the length of the song drags on and on, these songs never become stale or repetitive. It is amazing that this was put out by only two metal machines. (Or gods as I like to call them) Abbath and Horgh composed and performed a CD that will be nigh impossible to topple from its lofty mantle.    While Abbath handles the Bass, Guitar, and Vocals flawlessly, this CD gives Horgh his first chance to really shine behind the kit. Unlike Blizzard Beasts, which was full of hyper speed blast beats, this album gives him a chance to display his technical genius on more epic songs. From varying cymbal crashes to snare and tom fills, the drums on this album are really something to behold.     I may be a bit of a `mark' for Immortal, but with good reason. My list of metal idols includes Abbath and Horgh, but can you blame me? I will let you judge this CD for yourself, but more often than not, you will agree with my much deserved five star rating.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Okay, even thought I'm probably the biggest fan of \\"The O.C.\\" in the world, I will admit that season one was like 8100 times better than this one. The plots were not as deep as in the first season. Also, in this season they abused the Seth/Zack who wins Summer thing. Like, when she went back to Cohen from the damn airport I was hoping Zack would be off the show. The season started off okay and then went into a bit of a mid season slump, but during the last 5 or 6 episodes I was like, \\"YES! The old O.C. is back.\\" And I was right! The show ended with such an awesone cliffhanger that leaves so many unanswered questions, like... Is Ryan gonna be angry at Marissa for killing his brother.. Is Trey going to actually die...Will Marissa do jailtime.. Will Seth and Summer stay together (I love them both but really give it up who cares anymore..).. Will Kirsten give up her lame-ass drinking problem.. Will Julie and Jimmy last?.. So, in conclusion, I say that anyone who loves the sex, the scandal, the beach and the skin of \\"THE OC\\" they should definately buy this DVD set!
B00005JNJT|4.0|BATMAN BEGINS scraps the previous four execrable movies and returns to Batman's roots, with this coming-of-age tale of Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale), brooding vigilante hero.<br /><br />Bruce, who blames himself for the death of his parents, seeks to understand the criminal mind by recklessly throwing himself into crime as another man might drown his sorrows in liquor. He eventually ends up in an Asian prison where he is found by Ducard (Liam Neeson), who takes Bruce on as an initiate of the League of Shadows, vigilante ninja society extraordinaire.<br /><br />In the end, Bruce cannot embrace the League of Shadows' strictly black-and-white view of crime and criminals, destroys their stronghold, and returns to Gotham to clean up the place.<br /><br />It is fun to watch Bruce and his faithful butler/surrogate father, Alfred (Michael Caine), assemble the Batman gear from the forgotten store of military prototypes at Wayne Enterprises.<br /><br />When the League of Shadows returns to Gotham to finish what they started, Bruce must fight and overcome his former mentor to save his not-so-fair city.<br /><br />Christian Bale gives a performance which makes all the previous Batmans laughable. Fans of the graphic novels will applaud this latest addition to the Batman series, and be more than willing  to overlook (or be unaware of) the plot holes, scientific impossibilities, and historical inaccuracies.<br /><br />I, however, am too much of a science and history geek to suspend disbelief and simply enjoy a movie like this. I think anyone with a basic knowledge of how their home microwave oven works will think \\"Wait a minute...\\" when the bad guys stand blithely around their microwave superweapon as it cooks Gotham's water supply. (The human body is 90-what percent water?) And the League of Shadows takes credit for introducing the plague rats to Europe (which time?), burning London in 1666, and sacking Rome (which time?). Claiming credit for the Nazis would be just as ridiculous.ust as ridiculous.  <br />

Martin fully succeeds in this respect primarily through his use of perspective; he draws us into his imaginary medieval world and holds us there with the force of his characters' personalities.<br /><br />Martin employs a number of techniques that you are not likely to expect from fantasy, but the most obvious and substantial of these is the point of view through which the story is told. Each chapter simply holds the name of an individual character in the novel; and accordingly, each chapter follows the title character through one portion of the overall tale. The perspective is third person limited omniscient--meaning that the reader is privy to only the thoughts of each chapter's main character, but all of the actions surrounding them. So what? Well, Martin uses this approach to generate one of the few character-driven fantasy novels ever made that still brims with plot.<br /><br />From the prologue of A Game of Thrones on, it was almost physically impossible for me to close the book. Not only does Martin orchestrate the novel so that the reader shares the thought processes of his characters, but he seems to formulate a core moral structure for each character--their values, hopes, dreams, and fears--and then manipulate the plot until a point is reached where they must choose what truly matters to them. The result is that the reader gains insight into the thought processes, ethical fibers, and inner pains of every character: each is flawed, but real.<br /><br />Reality is the key aspect often forgotten in science fiction and fantasy; it does not come from the plausibility of fictional technologies or mythical creatures, but from the humanity of the characters. Martin could place Tyrion Lannister, for instance, in any setting and he would be compelling. Westeros is real place in this respect: imperfect, immoral, honorable, and idealistic people inhabit it--sometimes all in one character.<br /><br />Ultimately, if you are a fan of fiction, you owe this book your attention. It draws from a core of British history and ancient Celtic myth; fusing them more artfully than Hardy or even Yeats, and in a manner nearly as inventive as Joyce. However, unlike these authors, Martin has designed A Game of Thrones almost purely to entertain. Consequently, it possesses the capacity to satisfy both the most analytical and the most wistful of readers. Do yourself a favor: try fantasy, try Martin, and enjoy.creatures, but from the humanity of the characters.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|The original Matrix should have been left as a classic, stand-alone movie. Is there any effective follow-up to a messiah tale? (I know Frank Herbert fans would argue vehemently against me.) But Hollywood always wants to capitalize on commercial success and squeeze every dollar possible out of a concept. So many story arcs and sub plots started in the second movie are abruptly dropped or never pursued in this final installment of the trilogy. It is as if the movie makers suddenly said \\"Oh @$%, we gotta finish this movie - QUICK!\\" The plot shift is so drastic and unbelievable as to be almost comical.<br /><br />My Advice: See and love the first Matrix, then never, ever watch the following two movies. You'll be happier.
0060392886|5.0|Saw the band in 1985 when I was a 10th grade high school student, they were awesome.  Saw the band in 2005, 20 years later, now married with two daughters of my own, and they were better now than they were in 1985...unbelievable.  How many bands can you say that about...only the legends like the Stones, U2, and Motley Crue.   <br /> <br />The book was great and didn't hold much back.  Motley Crue is an in-your-face band and their autobiography was an in-your-face book:  you can love 'em or leave 'em, but you can't ignore them when they are right there in front of you, either on stage or on paper.  True Crue fans want to roll around with them and be a part of their Dirt!     <br /> <br />Guys, bring us some more, we're all aging right along with you and stickin' by ya through the process.

B00005JNSK|4.0|I remember the first time that I saw a trailer for this; my friend showed it to me on my computer, and it absolutely freaked me out.  It was colorful, it was trippy, and it had a VERY annoying song in the background.  Yet, I still was drawn to it.  For one thing, Tim Burton was directing it, and I have liked most of the Tim Burton movies that I have seen (let's not go into a Planet of the Apes discussion).  And while Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me, Johnny Depp took the role, made it his own, and did a very good job with it. <br />Seeing as how most people already know the ending, I am going to be a little more open with spoilers than I normally am.  Anyway, the choclateer Willy Wonka owns an amazing chocolate factory that churns out some of the best chocolate in the world.  Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy living with his parents (Noal Taylor, Helena Bonham Carter) and his grandparents (David Kelly, Eileen Essell, David Morris, and Liz Smith), most of whom have personalities in this film.  In the original, only Grandpa Joe was fleshed out as a character, but in this version, the only one without a distinct personality is Grandma Josephine (Essell).  Joe (Kelly) is an ex-worker in the factory, George (Morris) is a bit of a cynic, and Georgina (Smith) is a bit senile.  But they are all a very loving family. <br />After years of shutting himself off from the outside world and not allowing anyone to visit his factory due to past spies, Wonka has decided to allow 5 children to visit his factory.  They will be chosen through the use of Golden Tickets; 5 tickets are randomly placed into Wonka Bars going all over the world.  The first 4 children to find them are rich, fat, or have some special means to get the ticket that most children, especially Charlie, don't have.  Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) is an overweight German boy who could (and probably does) eat his weight in chocolate each day.  Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) is an over-spoiled girl whose father (James Fox) gives her whatever her heart desires (and the desire is fleeting; the moment she receives the ticket, without even saying \\"thank you\\", she asks for a new pony).  Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb) is an overcompetetive gum-chewing champ who feels that if she doesn't win the ticket, she fails.  It doesn't help that her mother (Missi Pyle) encourages the behavior.  Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry) is a video-game playing genius (with anger issues) who devises a mathematical formula to track down the ticket.  He only bought one bar (and didn't even eat it because he dislikes the taste of chocolate, which begs the question why he wanted to win a trip to a chocolate factory).  Charlie finds the ticket based on pure luck.  But soon the five children are off to the factory. <br />Once there, they meet the Oompa Loompas (all of them are played by Deep Roy), see fantastic machines and gizmos (such as a waterfall that exists to mix the chocolate), and meet their demise.  Yes, meet their demise.  Each character is done in by their flaws (gluttany, competitiveness, greed, and pride).  And with each loss of a child, Wonka seems almost elated. <br />This movie is a lot truer to its source material than the original (I mean this neither as a compliment or a jab, I am merely stating a fact).  The fact that Charlie's dad is alive, the Indian palace made of chocolate, and the departing view of the other four children after their mishaps (which I was very happy to see) were all in the book, but not the original film.  Although, the fact that the movie explored Wonka's childhood was both a blessing and a curse.  It was very interesting to see where Wonka came from (and it's always great to see Christopher Lee), but the whole point is that we don't know why Wonka is the way he is. <br />This movie definitely won't appeal to everyone, and I can foresee some Wilder vs. Depp fan arguments on the horizon.  But check it out, it's worth it.
B00005JNEI|2.0|I have questions about the Moore bandwagon, but NOT as a Bush supporter. I mean, like Alex Jones asked in his video, why didn't Moore talk about Norad standing down in his movie. When Moore was asked this by Jones he just shrugged and said that would be un-American. <br /> <br />How is that consistent with someone who is supposed to be investigating the real facts? I really don't get it.  <br /> <br />So with that in mind, I think there are a lot of better movies out there on the subject.
B00005JMXX|2.0|The Day After Tomorrow is silly good fun.  Great visual effects despite the silly plot line based on a book by Art Bell and some other guy.  That said Dennis Quaid mushing his way from DC to NYC is exciting, though how did he drive in a blinding blizzard from DC to Philly in 30 minutes?  And that is the problem with this movie.  Not only bad science, and I certainly adhere to the Global Warming theories, but oversights of the obvious.  A giant tidal wave hits the East Coast and all the phone systems work.  Yeah, that's believable.  The cell system even works after the electric grid fails.  Also, while they are burning books in the NY Public Library to keep warm can anyone explain why they were not burning wooden furniture first?  This movie gets so silly at times that whatever message it is trying to convey gets lost in all that silliness surrounded by special effects.  This one barely rates 2 1/2 stars.  Watch in the middle of winter I say.

B00005JMFQ|4.0|There are several moments in \\"Love Actually\\" which make it clear that this is a British movie and not an American one. It's as if they combined \\"Notting Hill\\" with splashes of \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" or \\"Monty Python\\" and maybe even a drop or two of \\"Benny Hill.\\" For an American audience this means that the movie will be at times funny and romantic, at others perplexing if not even offensive (to some).<br /><br />Many of the criticisms of this movie seem to be coming from the American perspective. It's true, the whole faux sex (while naked) thing between one couple is something you wouldn't see in American film. The art gallery with sexual images is yet another example. It's hard to believe that Americans would find any of this even remotely romantic.<br /><br />A lot of \\"Love Actually\\" is a statement about the British feelings toward the US. It's obvious that quite a few Brits find it amusing that some American women will go ga-ga over a British accent, regardless of the attractiveness of the bloke speaking.<br /><br />The most ignorant criticism of this movie, however, is the anger about what some think is an \\"anti-Americanism\\" because the prime minister (Hugh Grant's character) stands up to the US president. Some have foolishly suggested that this was some sort of of left wing agenda on the producers part. I can only assume that such viewers don't access the news beyond Fox or their local paper.<br /><br />Several polls have shown a majority of people on the planet, including in Britain, do not trust Bush. More importantly for this film, soon after 9-11 the British public, while sympathetic to US citizens, believed that Prime Minister Tony Blair was like \\"George Bush's poodle.\\" A majority of British citizens did NOT support Blair and saw him as a kiss-up to Bush. The director of \\"Love Actually\\" was no fool. He or she knew that British audiences wanted a leader who would stand up for Britain and not blindly follow the US. So the director simply gave them what they wanted. (Btw, it's not that Thorton is supposed to be Bush.  Rather, he simply represents US arrogance.)  If some viewers don't like that, well, maybe they need to figure out why British citizens feel that way. You can't blame the director.<br /><br />\\"Love Actually\\" is a very funny movie and it is, at times, romantic. However, it is a movie with British sensibilities.  It is not for those with conservative tastes regarding sexuality (especially interracial) or those who can't deal with how many people in the world view the US.
B00005JNJT|4.0|Batman begins is a good movie.  It answers several questions for those who have not read the DC series (i.e. Why \\"bats\\"?, Why are all the bad guys escaped from Arkam?,  Where does Bruce Wayne get his cool crime fighting gadgetry?, etc.).<br /><br />The stunts are great.  The bat-suit and utility belt are still imaginative.  The bat-cape is still too cool!  And, I want to park my '70s muscle car and drive this bat mobile (unlike the tiresome cars in the previous 4 flicks)!<br /><br />Bale is great as the Caped one.  Caine, Freeman, and Hauer are memorable in supporting action.<br /><br />The movie really takes off after the first 30 minutes of Zen-Judo weirdness.  The prison and ninja fights scenes are dull and boring- bordering on silly (as usual with martial arts stuff).<br /><br />Take a Date to this movie, you'll both enjoy it.

It's the fun- swash-buckling gold seekers, humanitarians feverishly working to save the world, despotic bad guys trying to knock off everyone- film of the year.<br /><br />Set in the Shara desert the heroes go after Confederate gold, while attempting to save the world from a life-threatening plague.  The 3rd world dictator interferes creating a great battle finale.  In the end, the hero saves the day and gets the car and girl.<br /><br />The stunts are great.  The flick features a Cairo class Civil War Iron Clad ship (the CSA \\"Texas\\", aptly named), a ton of gold, a Miami Vice style speed boat chase (complete with rock music), and a high altitude fist fight between McConaughey and a sinister terrorist-looking bad guy.  You know who wins this one!<br /><br />This movie proves that movie-goers still want high octane action! One hopes there's sequel in the mix.<br /><br />Buy this one... it promises be an action adventure classic.

0790729628|5.0|...even before many \\"johnny-come-latelys\\" came to love it over the years as a cult classic. <br /> <br />Personnaly, I never thought there was anything wrong with the Harrison Ford narrative voice-over.  It gave the film that classic 1940's film-noir feeling, kind of like hearing Fred MacMurray narrate DOUBLE INDEMNITY. <br />And as far as the original happy \\"Hollywood\\" ending through the mountains, isn't it nice to know that in the bleak, grim world of 2019 Los Angeles, there are still some places where the sun shines brightly? <br /> <br />That aside, this is a great movie to have on DVD, regardless of which version it is.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I have to say, first off, that if you're looking through random cd's, looking to spend some extra cash on something new, do so now. Don't even hesitate or think twice. <br /> <br />Simply put, Sigur Ros' ( ) is perfection. It is my favorite album, and probably will be for a long time. I must admit though, when I first got it and opened it on the way home from the store, layed back in my seat to listen, i wasn't stunned at all. The songs seemed to linger on forever, and not get to any solid point. But I noticed one thing, the lingering, was actually just beautiful. Over time, i'd throw it in the cd player and listen for a little while, and It started to grow on me, I started to see what everyone was talking about. Then one night, i put it in the cd player, listened to the whole thing, and then suddenly, and quite literally, it clicked. It was absolute genius. I understood what they were doing completely, and it overtook me. <br /> <br />The album, whether intentionally or not, is separated into two sections. I'd like to think it was intentionally, and that the two parenthesis represent the two halves of the cd. The first half are tracks 1-4. This half seems to soundtrack a frosty winter night in the woods. Full moon, brisk wind. Snow falling very slowly. The second half, tracks 5-8 (obviously) seem to soundtrack the morning after the first section. The sun coming up to bathe the land in glorious light.  <br /> <br />The last track ends with the same sound that the first track begins with. It ends in a sweeping epic that contrasts the beauty and subtle elegance that the album begins with. <br /> <br />Just buy the album, you know it sounds great. Go ahead.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is by far the funniest book I've ever read.  The humor is truly original and creative.  The dialogue is priceless and some of the situations Yossarian and some of the other main characters get in hit home in a chilling way. <br /> <br />Catch-22 has by far the best structure of any book I've ever read.  The book isn't in chronological order, but instead structured by theme.  The product is a realistic but specially sequencial order of events. <br /> <br />Catch-22 is by far the best book I've ever read.  From the beginning to the end, I was blown away.  I've reread it several times the same year.  The only drawback about Catch-22 is that it's not completely accessible.  Many people I've talked to hated the book. <br /> <br />But for someone whose pretty picky concerning books, I absolutely adored it!
B0007TKNII|1.0|This is a dark, brooding, depressing take-off on the popularity of a stage show. <br /> <br />Everything is mysterious . . the Phantom, the girl, the Opera House, his savior . . everything.  The backdrops are not only remote from reality, they are remote from any meaning whatsoever.  A walk through the dark cavernous halls of the Opera House ending on the roof in a snowstorm . . . another trip through the Opera House and we are led into a stream with grillwork that traps the hero.  In another scene the Phantom appears outside the Opera House . . did that really happen in the novel?  I thought that a major issue in the book was that he never left once he took up residence there.  Also missing was a cogent reason for his existence as the Phantom.  Wasn't that because he was a composer whose works were stolen and he plotted his revenge after everyone thought he was dead. <br /> <br />The same musical themes throughout the movie created its own version of Chinese water torture. <br /> <br />All in all, a terrible movie.  It is no substitute for the show. Nor is it a substitute for a worthwhile movie experience.. <br />
B00082ZS5W|5.0|Having released two albums that have sold by the truckload - \\"No Angel\\" and \\"Life for Rent\\" - this is Dido's first live offering : a DVD and a CD looking back to three dates played at London's Brixton Academy in August 2004.  <br /> <br />The DVD features 17 tracks - 9 of them lifted from \\"Life for Rent\\" while the remaining 8 appeared on \\"No Angel\\". With the exception of \\"This Land is Mine\\" and \\"My Lover's Gone\\", all my favourite Dido songs appear are here. It opens with \\"Stoned\\", and the Roswell High song, \\"Here With Me\\". The stories behind \\"See You When You're 40\\", \\"Life for Rent\\", \\"Mary's in India\\" and \\"Sand in my Shoes\\" are briefly told - though, where appropriate, the names have been omitted to protect the 'innocent'. Unfortunately, nothing was said on the story behind \\"Isobel\\" - I've always been curious about that one. Meanwhile, the famously sampled \\"Thank You\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"White Flag\\" get the 'big song-along' treatment.  <br /> <br />It may seem an odd thing to say, given that she is a professional performer, but Dido does seem to be very comfortable on-stage. Unlike some artists I've seen, there's no obvious signs of ego, general vanity or grumpiness - the intros and links between the songs seen more like an informal chat. The camera work and the lighting are excellent, while there are a couple of characters in the band - Keith Golden, the bass guitarist, appears to be one of those kids who likes doing his own thing. There's also (if you look closely) an appearance by Animal from \\"The Muppet Show\\"... <br /> <br />The CD features 12 of the tracks from the concert, and lasts for nearly an hour. \\"Don't Leave Home\\", \\"Do You Have a Little Time\\", \\"Hunter\\", \\"My Life\\" and (oddly, I thought) \\"All You Want\\" are the five songs that were dropped, while the intros also missed the cut. Without the 'distractions' of the stage show, the CD emphasises just how good Dido is live.  <br /> <br />Neither the CD nor the DVD contain any new material, so I wouldn't expect this release to win any new fans - if you hated \\"No Angel\\" and \\"Life for Rent\\" there's really no point in buying this. However, if you're a fan, it's definitely recommended. Slip it into your DVD player, rest your feet on your coffee-table and enjoy ! <br />

And I seen it was compared to many of the other bands I liked so I dieced to check them out. I knew I like the \\"heavens a lie\\" song was good so I thought the other songs would be just as good or better. But man was I wrong. The other songs just sound the same. You wouldn't know if the changed the beat of the song because you feel so exhausted from hearing it. The male vocals screws up the material completle. The band sound like a new garage band. The only part of the band is that it makes me laugh =). And P.S this band isn't in the catorgory of \\"gothic\\". I know what gothic music sounds like and this isn't even close.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|This is a movie with superb special effects, the visions of Hell are especially slick.  This movie makes you think.  I normally dont like movies that are based even loosely on religion, but this one crosses over into science fiction mixed with the religious theme and totally holds your interest through the whole film. <br /> <br />Casting is very good, and this is a dvd that will look and sound great on a big tv with a good surround sound system in your house.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I personally was siked about seeing this movie.  I couldn't wait, because as a kid I loved watching the original with Gene Wilder.  So I drug my wife who wasn't so thrilled and her kid-brother to the movies.  I personally loved this movie, beggining to end.  I thought that it was beautifully shot, complettly draws you into each frame, and although I had read numerous reviews that mentioned Depps performance to be 'over the top' and very 'jackson-ish' I thought he was perfect.  He really made the film enjoyable.  He may have been a little creepy and or corny at times, but thats what made it so great.  Johnny Depp is one of those great entertainers, like Crowe, who is never the same.  They completly morph into a charactor and thats what Depp did here.  Another rising star is young Freddie Highmore who played Charlie.  He is the next Haley-Joel Osmand I guerenty it.  Maybe this time the kid won't dissapear after he hits puberty.  Anyways, the movie was a refreshing taste of holliwood, a great little escape into the weird and yet complete fun.  Tim Burton will get an oscar nod I'm almost sure of it, and for that he deserves it as well as little Highmore...be nice to see him get recognition as well.  Anyways...see this movie..you will be pleased, I promise.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|The screenwriters of Van Helsing set out to roll all the old Hollywood monster flicks into one, linking Frankenstein, Dracula, the Wolfman, The Hunchback, Dr. Jeckyl, and a few others.  Somehow they made it work in Van Helsing, turning a creepy genre into an adrenaline-paced Transylvanian romp.  This film is fun, fast, and fictional.    Don't watch Van Helsing expecting great acting or tremendous subtlety.  Like the modern Mummy movie, it's more fun and adventure, with a touch of evil.  Hugh Jackman, in the title role, plays an enigmatic Van Helsing with memory loss.  He works for a secret anti-evil Vatican order.  Of course, for modern PC sake, the order has some token Muslims and Buddhists tossed in, but the Cardinals run the show and give the hero the best technology the late 1800's can provide.    Kate Beckinsdale is a delightfully curvy, assertive heroine, and the supporting roles are well-done, especially a particularly wormy Igor, very reminiscent of the wormy Bennie in The Mummy remake.    Go get this and settle in this the popcorn and pop for a fun good time.  Suspend disbelief and enjoy the action.  This film has a great dark, chilly look, and nice, snippy/snappy dialogue.  Worth owning and watching more than once.

Enter Anna (Roberts), a photographer who takes pictures of Dan for his novel...as you may have guessed (as did I) the time has passed years maybe and Dan and Alice are now an item and Dan has published his book.  Well, heres the problem.  Dan falls for Anna but she won't have him, you know, she won't bring herself to wreck what he has going on with Alice, but Dan is insistant.  In an attempt to exact his revenge on Anna, Dan goes to a sex-chat room and finds Larry (Owen), a sex hungrey Doctor with a few fetishes up his sleeve.  Well, Dad is under the ID of Anna and he describes himself to Larry and asks to meet him.  How Dan knew where Anna would be is beyond me, but by chance he was right and Larry meets Anna, and Larry likes Anna, and surprisingly Anna likes Larry and soon the two are engaged.  Now it's time for the fun to begin.  See now we have the affair that stirs up between Dan and Anna, the illicit afair that should have never happened.  The affair that tears apart a marriage and Dan's healthy (if you could call it that) relationship with a stripper (did I mention Alice was a stripper?  don't get your hopes up boys, no boobs).  Anyways, I have this to say...it's not the act of cheating on your partner that makes this whole movie so, how do I put this, demoralizing, because everybody knows that a lot of people cheat...it's the lack of compassion these people have for the ones they are hurting.  The way they talk to each other shows nothing but disgust for their supposed mate...the one they vowed to love forever.  As a married man I can honestly say that I could never talk to my wife the way these people communicate, but then again, I've never been in this sort of situation and I guess if my wife slept with some other man and told be she liked the taste of his seman better than mine I'd probably have a word or two to say to her as well, but other than that, lets be real here...These people seem to have no respect for themselves, but then again it's as if they really don't even know who they are...To tell you the truth I honestly thought this movie would be different, but thats not to say I didn't like it...I gave it four stars and thats mainly because it was so different than anything I've seen and it took a situation and made you look at it in a way I've never looked at it before...it really made you think...Believe me, there are no role models here, and despite how things end up it's really less than a happy ending...especially for Dan, but what the heck...I mean, he deserved it...Right?
B0006399FS|3.0|U2 has been a big break through with this big commerical album of their singles \\"Vertigo\\", \\"All Because of You\\" and \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\". Yeah i like the singles but after that their is some other goods I like but this isn't their best effort.
B0002KQNL8|1.0|I made the mistake of not listening to other reviewers comments about the change in soundtrack and bought this DVD anyway because I really wanted to own this movie.  The new soundtrack that they have added makes the film completely unwatchable. I will now be selling my DVD and looking for an original version with the original background soundtrack on VHS or laserdisc. The studio then had the audacity to give the viewers a real kick in the groin by adding the original soundtrack on to the film IF you watch it in the French Language track. THAT IS UNFAIR and the studio should fire everyone assosciated with the release of this DVD. If you needed more time to acquire whatever rights there are to acquire for a 20 year old horror movie's background soundtrack, then you should have done it before releasing this to DVD.  The movie, as it is on this DVD, is unwatchable and the music is GARBAGE.  If you are a fan of this movie, DO NOT BUY THIS DVD UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. If you do, I guarantee disappointment.
B000008EXZ|5.0|When \\"Come Taste The Band\\" reaches it's final tracks I feel like crying, and I'm not sure if that's because the music is so deep on those tracks or because I know the album is almost over... <br /> <br />This album is one of those one-of-a-kind masterpieces. And just in case you're concerned about it, Tommy Bolin is an excellent replacement for the unreplaceable Ritchie Blackmore. He also sings on \\"Dealer\\". I can pretty much say that if you like MkIII Deep Purple, you'll like MkIV as well. <br /> <br />If you are a Whitesnake fan, you'll also notice the influence this album had on the early Whitesnake material that has been written right after. <br /> <br />I think \\"This Time Around/Owed to 'G'\\" is also one of the most interesting musical experiences you can get from this album, since it's a very deep and soulful medley. Of course, most \\"headbangers\\" won't like it, but mature music appreciators are sure to love it. The other tracks are, simply put, the hard-rock excellente you'd expect from any early Deep Purple album. (This is the last Deep Purple album before their long retirement until \\"Perfect Strangers\\") <br /> <br />Last, but not least, the cover artwork is one of the coolest around. In the front cover, you see a glass filled with wine and the faces of the band members within the liquid. In the back cover, the glass is almost empty with a lipstick mark on it.

B000002H6C|5.0|And JUstice For All is Metallica's most musically technical album, with guitar-solos, riff-changes, complex intros/outros a-plenty. Lyrically it tells of a wasted and dark society that we as humans must live in. Songs such as \\"One\\" (limbless soldier who has to still live), \\"Blackened\\" (\\"death of mother earth/never a rebirth\\"), and \\"And Justice for All\\" (rant against U.S. justice system) epitomize the overall feel of this album very well. <br /> <br />From a metal point of view, this is easily Metallica's heaviest album. However, unlike their previous efforts, Justice is not heavily laden with thrash metal tracks. Most of the songs on the record are slow, brooding, angry hard rock numbers, filled with spiteful lyrics.  <br /> <br />The thrash-metal pioneers' fourth effort has more complex song strutures than any of their previous albums, which explains the fact that the shortest song is \\"Dyer's Eve\\" at 5:12 and the longest is \\"To Live is to Die\\" at 9:48. The average songlength is probably somewhere around seven minutes. <br /> <br />Metallica's fourth album also features their most sophisticated instrumental, \\"To Live is To Die\\", sort of an ode to their fallen bassist, Cliff Burton, who wrote the spoken word section of the song before he died in a bus accident. If you want to call Bon Jovi and Van Halen songs power ballads, then go right ahead. If you want a ballad that is actually powerful, then go for \\"To Live is To Die\\". It really is wonderful when music can speak for itself and a song can be a tear-jerker without having any sung words to it. It opens up with an acoustic guitar playing a pretty tune, and then fades out to a heavy metal riff. The rest of the song is primarily metal-based, but there is an extremely beautiful interlude in the middle featuring violins, non-distorted guitar, and a pretty, sorrowful riff being played. <br /> <br />\\"To Live is to Die\\" is an excellent song, however, the masterpiece of the album is \\"One\\". It begins with one of the best guitar solos ever concieved, played by a near-acoustic undistorted guitar, with a strong feeling of pain to it. Once the lyrics begin, they are filled with just as much agony as the solo that precedes them. \\"I can't remember anything/can't tell if this is real or dream/deep down inside I feel the scream/this terrible silence stops me\\" laments James Hetfield in a melodic and yet somehow menacing vocal tone. \\"Hold my breath as I wish for death/please god wake me\\" makes up the short but intense chorus of \\"One\\". The song towards the end turns into a thrash ballad, with two paragraphs of misery described in Hetfield's rough, angry scream.  <br /> <br />\\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" is anotherm highpoint of the album, featuring a great opening riff, and very well-written lyrics about a suburban man driven to the edge. \\"My life suffocates/planting seeds of hate/I've loved, turned to hate/dropped far beyond my fate/I give, you take/this life that I forsake/been cheated of my youth/you turned this lie to truth\\" makes up the first verse, along with the bridge \\"Anger, misery/you'll suffer unto me\\". One of the heaviest songs on And Justice for All but also easily one of the best. <br /> <br />The only lowpoint of And Justice for All is the anti-censorship rant \\"Eye of the Beholder\\". Mainly because the verses are so good and then the chorus just musically doesn't flow at all with them, and also because the chorus's lyrics aren't all that well-written. \\"Independance limited/freedom of choice is made for you my friend/freedom of speech is words that they will bend/freedom with their exception.\\" No clever metaphors. No interesting poetic phrases like in \\"One\\". Instead Hetfield decides just to go for flat-out explanation, which is kind of boring to me. A much better anti-government track on the album is \\"The Shortest Straw\\", which actually uses catchy phrases and metaphors and has a good verse AND chorus. <br /> <br />However, \\"Eye of the Beholder\\" isn't bad enough to bring the whole album down with it, and so And Justice for All still towers and a hateful, angry, searing metal masterpiece.
B00005JNJT|5.0|A dark and forboding film with a serious Noir twist, as Gotham tends to be. For Me, some of the most profound scenes commenced in the beginning sequences of the movie during the temple scenes, wherein it is established that the caped crusader did indeed train with Ninjas, and is in fact, a Ninja himself, which explains much of his exploits from agility to ingenuity, amazing strength to stamina and boundless energy, the skill and the training, the expertise in weaponry, the self-discipline and determination, the psychological projections and invisibility - all of these and more, taught through Ninjutsu. Here, Ninjas represent a balancing force in nature, the \\"legion of shadows\\" who go forth into human civilization when excesses are reached.  Ra's Al Ghul {Ken Watanabe} is present here, the veritable Shidoshi, and Ducard {Liam Neeson}, Wayne's mentor and sensei who rescued him from the clutches of a filthy prison, which was the result of his own fiece self-exploration.<br /><br />For those familiar with the origins of the Batman chronicles, we know how The Dark Knight originates, through unfortunate and tragic events concerning the rotten dregs of the underbelly of society - and this adversity caused the inspired greatness of this tenebrious form, eventually leading him upon a personal journey to find his place within nature and to plunge the darkest recesses of his own shadow side, as Shadowmancy is accessed and utilized, one's inner monsters employed towards beneficial endeavors.<br /><br />His primary foe herein is The Scarecrow, a mental health professional who has developed a psychotropic narcotic in aerosol form, which bestowes hallucinogenic torment upon those so afflicted, combined with his fear mask, essentially, a blank slate, a veritable canvas for the victims to paint the gruesome forms of their own horrors. Quite ingenious, actually.<br /><br />The ever-carnal Bruce Wayne arrays himself with fleshly pleasures when not in his alter-ego, indulging in superb women, and finery of all sorts. He surprised the residents in his own company when he one day returned from the frozen tundras of Tibet to Gotham City, feeding his demonic appetite when opportunity allowed. He does have somewhat of a love interest in Rachel Dawes {Katie Holmes} , a childhood sweetheart, yet their extreme professions frequently take them in sweeping dramatic directions.<br /><br />There is a clue at the film's conclusion which opens for the idea of a sequal, and even the probable character...<br /><br />I found the film's primary focus to be that of a shadowmantic nature - that is, accessing the primal fears buried in the subconscious and surfacing them to either terrify or edify, according to the fortitude of the subject.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a welcomed evolution in the Batman Saga, considering the former two jokes previously produced which obviously catered to the slovenly herd; and although this chraracter is one of comic book legendry, the personality absolutely displays de-facto qualities of the Satanic mindset, and has remained a prototypal Devil throughout.superb women, and finery of all sorts.

B00005JNSK|4.0|Ok, Johnny Depp has an underniable talent in acting. He can magically craft himself into any role he needs to do. So can he morph himself into the already made Willy Wanka? Yes and no. His characters works, being a nice comic relief for the movie. But you can't help but feel that he basically ripped his character off of Michael Jackson, which he can swear up and down he didn't do but the audience has eyes and wont be fooled.<br /><br />You are taken to a strange world, which ranges from the chocolate palace, to Charlie's deformed house, to the inside of Wanka's factory. Many will quickly take a liking to Charlie, a polite yet poor boy who miraculously got into the factory. And accompanying him are four other brats adjoined with their own type of sins. Veruca is a snotty spoiled brat, Viola being a competitive twit, Mike is another brat living his life through videogames, and Augustus makes a pig out of himself. Each end up getting what comes to them, which stays loyal to both the book and movie.<br /><br />The acting is done wonderfuly, even so with the questionable Johnny Depp. It also branches out from the original in true Tim Burton style to prevent it from being a clone of the book and previous movie. The visuals are stunning, and the oompa loompas' musical scenes are humorous and left me with some laughs. The only draw back is that the ending was a tad rushed, and Johnny Depp doesn't seem to do the role justice. But other than that, the movie is clever and creative.
B00005JNSK|4.0|The book as well as the original cinematic presentation holds a special place in My heart, and remains an occasional pleasure for evocative entertainment. I wrote a review for the original film with Gene Wilder here, which remains the optimum adaptation, in My opinion. There are certain noticable comparisons that can be made, however. While Gene Wilder portrays Wonka as more of a misanthropic mad scientist-type of personality, Johnny Depp portrays the \\"Candy Dandy\\" character in an effeminate and androgynous manner {somewhat reminiscent of Michael Jackson, sans the perverse connotation; almost like what Jackson wishes he was} with a rather dubious overbite, sometimes even getting in the way of speech leaving him with a slight lisp. Still, that observation matters little in the overall manifestation here, as it was quite enjoyable for its own sake, although I found the one actor used for the Umpah-Loompahs rather pugnacious to be honest, even though Umpah Land is said to be located in some tropical location - I could definitely see the need for makeup here. This may have been an opportunity for Gary Coleman, Emmanuel Lewis, or \\"Wee Man\\" to become involved. Also, instead of the flute to call them forth, he utters some sort of amazonian call, and does not sing a bit.<br /><br />Included in this version, the origins of little Willy Wonka as a stuffy dentist's son who refused him sublime Halloween treats - ALL candy in fact, to preserve that bleachy smile encased in a metal contraption reminiscent of the one used in Marilyn Manson's \\"Sweet Dreams\\" video. The personal identification opposing his oppressive father is obvious, in his subsequent obsession into the candy fetish.<br /><br />The other actors seem well cast, and the underlying message still gets across. The soundtrack is splendid, rendered marvellously by \\"Red Wolf\\" himself, the erubescent Danny Elfman, with vocals included! Actually, I could see him depicting Willy Wonka quite nicely.<br /><br />Overall, a bit 'softer' than the original, but a charming and fun presentation nonetheless.al, but a charming and fun presentation nonetheless.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|I bought the DVD and also watched the live concert in Atlanta but the Eagles are not the same without the best guitarist in the band, Don Felder. No comparison with Hell Freezes Over granted they played 30 songs here.  Don Henley sounded tight (I guess since he's older...) The replacement for Don Felder is never a comparison. 'I can't tell you Why' was different without Felder's accompaniment (Timothy Schmidt did a great job but his performance at HFO is better). Felder's rendition of Hotel California was awesome at HFO and the guy that replaced him just did not hit it off....this concert was good but HFO was far much better.  Jow Walsh was great but jamming with that new guy is not the same as when he's jamming with Felder...Good concert in general but the originality (without Felder) was missing! Not an original band anymore....
B00005JNSK|4.0|For those of you who are not avid fans of the movie Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, a little history.  Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory featured Gene Wilder as Wonka, an eccentric entrepreneur fond of candy of all stripes. The movie was based on a book for children, titled \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" by Roald Dahl.  The change in the title is telling, as it explains the focus of both the book and the movie.  When the movie came out, it didn't do very well, but has slowly achieved cult status on DVD.  Of course, it was only a matter of time before someone remade it.<br /><br />And that someone is Tim Burton, master of the wacky, whimsical, and macabre.  Having matured somewhat from the days of Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas, Burton has begun to imbue his films with more focus.  Big Fish was evidence that something has changed, and Burton is less willing to leave his characters bizarrely and endearingly mysterious.<br /><br />That leads us to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  You might assume that the change in the name means an emphasis once more on Charlie, but that's not really the case.  This movie, while truer to the book that inspired it, is still all about Willy Wonka.  Wonka's story seems a bit dated when you consider the plot: Wonka is an enigmatic and eccentric millionaire who decides to invite five children to tour his chocolate factory.  One of the five children will win something very special.  The rest...well the rest don't deserve it.<br /><br />But as an adult, the film has many other levels.  For example, Charlie's (Freddie Highmore) father, Mr. Bucket (Noah Taylor) puts caps on toothpaste and barely scrapes by at that.  His family is dirt poor; all four of his grandparents sleep in the same bed in the same room, where his mother and father live.  They don't even have a full roof over their heads.  And every day they eat cabbage soup.  Then one day, a robot replaces Charlie's father. And suddenly we realize, Charlie's father is representative of the employees sent reeling by the industrial age, from manual labor in the fields to manual labor in factories...to automation that ultimately makes manual laborers obsolete.<br /><br />Wonka decides to get rid of all the workers after too many of them end up selling his company's secret recipes.  Frustrated by the security breaches, Wonka fires all his workers.  And yet, the work continues.  How?  Wonka journeys to Loompaland, where he recruits the Oompa Loompas.  They all look the same (because they're all the same actor, Deep Roy).  They worship the cocoa bean, making them perfectly suited to working for Wonka. He can even pay them with cocoa alone!<br /><br />Or to put it another way, Wonka outsources his workforce.  They're from a \\"warm country,\\" industrious, and work for far less pay.<br /><br />The children are all mirrors of different parts of society, and Burton can't resist poking fun at simultaneously updating them and poking fun at modern tropes.  We have the gluttonous Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), the greedy Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the violent Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry), and the overachieving Violet Beauregarde (Annasophia Robb).  Who isn't concerned about children becoming an Augustus Gloop, in a world of Supersizes where children stay inside all day? Who isn't concerned about spoiling their children rotten like Veruca Salt, where every kid has more than his parents ever dreamed of? What's to keep a Mike Teavee from using his superior, angry intellect that he vents on a videogame on his playmates...with a gun?  And isn't every Violet Beauregarde representative of the all-singing, all-dancing bleach-blonde cheerleaders-in-the-making that their parents trot out for beauty pageants? These children aren't horrible...they are a walking ghoul show of every adult's worst nightmares.<br /><br />It goes without saying that all these children fall victim to their respective sins and are cast out of Wonka's factory.  This sort of blatant retaliation against kids is rare these days, and it's a little shocking to see them get their just desserts.  Each departure is accompanied by an Oompa Loompa song, which went from cutesy Wizard of Oz type dances in the original movie version, to pure MTV/VH1 schlock rock.  I've never imagined Oompa Loompas in a swim routine, retro-80s dance off, acid rock antics, or Weird Al-style video montages.  It's deliriously funny and more than a little confusing at times.<br /><br />Through it all is Wonka himself.  The excellent Johnny Depp plays Wonka as a cross between Walt Disney and Michael Jackson.  This mix makes him alternately creepy and comical; Wonka is not always a sympathetic figure, but then you get the sense that perhaps he's not supposed to be.<br /><br />Wonka's story is fleshed out a bit more to explain who he is and how he came to be such a freak.  Additionally, the ending has been tweaked to leave everyone with a better conscience, which isn't such a bad thing.  However, the film has enough disturbing moments that it's not for young children...whimsy does not mean immature, and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely aimed at adults.<br /><br />In summation, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is actually a very basic morality play.  By keeping it simple and yet poking fun at political mores, fads, and icons (even shifting from 50s-style dress to 80s-style music), Burton creates a tale that's alternately funny, heartwarming, and a dire warning for parents everywhere.  Don't let your kids eat too much, spend too much, play too many games, or try too hard to be a winner.<br /><br />With standards like that, perhaps none of us deserve a visit to Wonka's Chocolate Factory.onka's factory.

B000067CPX|5.0|I swore this band was dead after One Hot Minute and I was very glad when they came back with Californiacation which was a very good album but not my favorite. Then By The Way came out. I got it two years later then everyone else but that doesn't matter. This record shows they've matured a lot in the last few years, transforming them from gritty punk-funk rockers to sunny California-style rockers, and honestly there are few bands out there who sound like this.  <br />    The music is rich and textured, leaning more towards grooves and mid-tempo tracks rather than truly rocking out, though \\"By The Way\\", the radio staple \\"Can't Stop\\" and \\"Minor Thing\\" with its hard-hitting surprise rap verse show it's not because they can't anymore. But they are most effective on slower grooves like \\"Universally Speaking\\" and \\"Dosed\\" and when they stretch out musically on the Spanish guitar romp \\"Cabron\\", the string-laden, and somewhat haunting \\"Midnight\\" and the horn-tinged pleasant ballad \\"Tear\\".  <br />     This CD is so good that only a couple tracks can be considered filler but even they (\\"Throw Away Your Television\\", \\"Warm Tape\\", and maybe \\"On Mercury\\") are listenable, as the band has made sure each song has a well-written memorable chorus and some sort of hook, and give something to the album's overall cohesion.     <br />     They are still that gritty band from the LA streets (though they really only sound something like it on the two darkest tracks \\"This Is The Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\", which are both solid cuts) but now have evolved into something greater. <br />    Sure, people might yell about how the cheery \\"Zephyr Song\\" and songs like \\"I Could Die For You\\" and \\"Universally Speaking\\" sound like attempts at just grabbing mainstream radio success, but that's not necessarily true. The songs may be appealing to that audience, but outside of this CD and maybe college radio, I've never heard them get airplay(only \\"By The Way\\" and \\"Can't Stop\\" get real airplay and now are being added to the dying world of FM radio's playlists a.k.a. List of Songs To Play Till They Die With Our Ever Diminishing Audience).  <br />   So all in all it's hard to argue that the RHCP haven't turned out a fantastic album that defies the idea that talent diminishes as bands grow older, rather that they have aged gracefully, wisely have put their wildest funk-rocking days of their youth behind them, and show it well here. The evolution that began on their comeback of sorts Californiacation continues on By The Way with euqally dazzling results.

You have to be an ostrich living in the sand to not realize we are radically altering our environment with some chilling possibilities for weather shifts in the next couple of hundred years.  If we care about our grandchildren and great grandchildren, we should ponder the possibility that man is having an effect on his environment in subtle but dangerous ways.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The Force is used to create things. Life... indeed, creativity is the force itself. What I fail to recognize in these posts by others who have watched the movie is their own creativity in response to the movie. Not all things have failures. <br /> <br />The creation of cities started under water; the creation of states started in space. These things are majestic. <br /> <br />What we fail to understand here is like episode ii, where the force is boring. At times this movie drags on so long you can't naturally get the plot, nor are you interested in things like evil. <br /> <br />Some points: <br /> <br />; Darth Sidious has been taught by Darth Plagus and then murdered Plagus sometime in an attempt to usurp his position and power. Sith deal in extremes, eternity, and absolutes. <br /> <br />; The Jedi study what Qui-Gonn believes is the \\"Jedi Arts\\". This means they pursue the human character more than the violence of forcing others to be moral and correct. In fact, not only would this destroy the human character of beings who pretend to be superior, but would naturally cause others to attack it. The force cannot be attacked. It is a concept that is reiterated over and over again in this film. <br /> <br />; Darth Maul is the definition of real magic power, which is why it is hard to understand the beliefs of the movie. Darth Maul smiles at all fake magic power and real magic power combined. So he's the meaning of life and meaningless magic power together. An intriguing character, to say the least. <br /> <br />; It is very ethical for the trade federation to own droids with weapons, because in this universe, the freedom of trade (contraband and illegality) across planets, and greed, cannot be protected. Trade has a natural ally in the unwise. So \\"Greed can be a powerful ally\\" is a healthy quote, reflecting maturity. Another thing is that the power of conglomerates across planescapes that occur in natural settings would require the formation of armies, not organic orliving or sentient at all, to protect them. If they were sentient, they might resolve to smuggle or steal the shipments. This is the Star Wars universe. Hopefully when we go out into space, we'll be wiser and not be as judgmental or harsh with our laws that this would be required. But according to the Star Wars universe, this is possible. Perhaps it is a statement against galactic government across planets? The ego is not wise enough perhaps. <br /> <br />I also believe that if this were a movie not about Anakin, but about pure morality, it would not really create the imaginations you would come to expect from Star Wars. At least this was formulaic, if you think so, and generated a lot of sympathy. It would feel more like death. Someone telling you what to do but not being able to do it. That's not the force, nor a good definition of that spiritual concept. <br /> <br />Try to imagine what others may have expected. Jedis destroying racism.... Jedis destroying all inhuman acts of goodwill... Jedis making judgments and resolving things... if you have read some books in the Star Wars universe, you know you dread these moments and want to get back to the points where they're fighting and losing and escaping, much like this movie was. <br /> <br />Pretty soon, you have a barren planet, and nothing on it but junk. Kind of like Tatooine. So the Force creates complexity.
B0007P3582|1.0|So, here it is. The follow up to that damned trash heep Get rich or Die Trying' (Funny how he cant spell anything). I thought it couldn't get any worse, but how wrong I was...This has to be one of the crappiest \\"albums\\" (I refer to it as a frisbee) I've ever heard. I was at my dads house one day, and my sister Ashley was blasting this crap through the radio. I said \\"What the hell is that noise\\". She said \\"It be da new fiddy CD\\" (Yes, she is white). I got so sick of it in 3 seconds that I got a headache, and I just decided to go to my friend Vince's house. We were going to play frisbee because there was nothing else to do, but alas, no fribee. I knew what I had to do. I went back to my house and stole the CD from my sisters sterio, she was watching The Wrong World in the living room. When I made it back to Vinces he had found a basketball, so I just decided to frisbee the plastic in the garbage. It makes a GREAT frisbee! But I now use it as a coaster, because I ended up breaking the edge and now it wont fly straight, dammit. Oh well, if you want to spend $15 on a really thin, 6 inch plastic frisbee, then this is what to buy, but DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT put this in your sterio/CD player/radio/anything that plays plastic such as this.    Update 7/22/05  That guy \\"MTV Rocks\\", yeah what a stupid f**k. I normally dont make fun of peoples opinions because they do have a right to believe what they want. But this guy insults great bands like Van Halen, Megadeth, and Steve Vai while worshipping godawful crap such as \\"fiddy\\" here. Sorry \\"MTV rocks\\" but you, Bush, and eMpTyV are why most countries hate the USA. (this used to be a great country in the 60's - 90's, what happened?)
B000020617|4.0|Foo Fighter's continue to shake and move the rock scene with this their third album release. This album from 1999 called 'Nothing Left To Lose' has 11 tracks and a special enhanced section for PC users to get to special webmedia and also the video of 'Learn To Fly' that made No 1 on the US and Australian charts between 1999 and 2000. The video clip accompanying this song is one hilarious plane trip ride where everyone except the band becomes drug induced and high.<br /><br />The other great songs on this pure rock with some deeper moments are; 'Aurora', 'Headwires' and 'MIA'.<br /><br />I have become a proud fan now of the Foo Fighters.
B000059TEQ|3.0|Perhaps the best moment associated with the infamous, slightly different version of this tag line came in another movie: What's Up, Doc? with Ryan O'Neal & Barbra Streisand. She says the line; he uproariously replies: \\"That's the dumbest thing I ever heard.\\" And that's true: love does mean having to say you're sorry to the other person, out loud, and meaning it. The expectation of sympatico silent udnerstanding doesn't and shouldn't always work.<br /><br />But to the movie in specific: it was great for its time when moviemaking was far less sophisticated than now, and audiences less demanding of actual plot, dialogue and acting. Ryan O'Neal's acting here is barely servicable at best; Ali MacGraw could NOT act and this movie gave immense testimony to that fact, which was further bolstered by her subsequent movies. The acting from the rest of the cast members was stilted, and the dialogue was never free-flowing or believable. The film was ok for its time and if viewed that way, but if you are going to watch it with a 2005 sensibility and set of cinematic expectations - be prepared to say you're sorry you spent the time.
B00005JMXX|3.0|WEll After seeing the movie the first time I loved it. I decided to listen to the commentary. This turned the movie into a complete joke. I could care less to hear about how many times the director or writer got tanked and worked the next day. This whole movie seemed to have been CGI'd or some type of work. Not the flood and frozen parts with the statue of liberty but even the simple stuff. It was like thye spent their whole time in front of a blue screen and pasted everything else in it. Why not just go and past in the actors too? It was just a real letdown listening to the commentary. If I had heard it first I would have never bought the movie.
B000002UAX|5.0|Any Beatle fan will tell you that it's hard to narrow down one specific album as their greatest but this one is in the running. Having just come back from the hills of Tibet with the Mahirishi in 1968, the Beatles were flowing with musical ideas, including George, who was suddenly writing as much as Lennon and McCartney. The result was the bands' first two record set,a potpourri of musical styles and influences. It's less produced and more earthy than the somewhat self-indulgent Sgt Pepper and it's even a bit dark at times. All in all, another Beatle masterpiece! A must for your Beatle collection
B000056IKS|5.0|Astonishing record from german group Neu! The discs very very long difficult to find but now they have been reissued and are absolutely indispensable to any collection...
B000002MFE|5.0|When this album came out in the early 90s I was thrilled. MTV Unplugged had opened the door to acoustic mainstream music again and Clapton stepped up to crown this genre with the perfect performance of classic tunes, even stepping back to the Delta with two great Robert Johnson songs. Claptons' band is at its' best and the moving version of Tears in Heaven is unparalled. As much of a fan of Claptons' electric playing as I am, I still prefer his acoustic work and if this music was the kind he did for the rest of his career it would suit me just fine. In fact I was a bit disappointed last year when he put out Me and Mr Johnson because it was electric rather than acoustic. After hearing his versions of Johnsons' Walkin' Blues and Malted Milk Blues on Unplugged, I was eager to hear other Johnson tunes covered this way
B00005MAM2|5.0|This ambitious, multi-million dollar animated adaptation of Katsuhiro Otomo's best-selling graphic novel series is spectacular, both on a technical and visceral level.  A lot of effort was obviously put into making the animation as fluid and lively as possible, with stunning results that rivals Disney's finest.  Most Japanese animated films tend to have a somewhat stilted frame rate (for economical reasons), but one look at AKIRA and you would definitely think otherwise.<br /><br />It is important to note, however, that this is NOT a Disney/family-friendly kind of film.  Neither is it for the squeamish of viewers (or the shallowest of minds, for that matter).  This is a gritty, futuristic, post-apocalyptic tale involving juvenile delinquents, corrupt government politicians, and a cautionary message about the misuse of supernatural powers.  Trying to describe the plotline may be a bit of a challenge, because at times it comes across as convoluted and difficult to follow.  (This can mainly be attributed to the fact that Otomo was trying to compress his 2,000+ page graphic novel into one two-hour film.)  It will take more than one viewing to make any sense out of this labyrinthine story, yet there are cautionary messages that one can ultimately take away from the experience.<br /><br />AKIRA is obviously not targeted at young children, but at a more mature audience.  Good thing, too, because the film contains an extreme amount of intense violence (and very graphic at that) as well as one brief but very disturbing scene where a female character is almost raped.  The really gruesome stuff occurs in the last thirty minutes in which a young teenager (who happens to be the angst-ridden anti-hero of the story) has his arm amputated by a space satellite (with bloody results), gets a metallic replacement, and transforms into a gross, indistinguishable mass of flesh and gore.  The latter sequence is one of the multiple \\"bizarre\\" set pieces present in the movie (others which include a nightmare in which cuddly, innocent-looking toys grow to enormous size and threaten a medical patient).  The obviously frightening aspects of such moments will obviously alienate family-friendly audiences, yet at the same time explode with imaginative, grotesque visuals rarely matched in other films (unless you count Hayao Miyazaki's works).<br /><br />Also worthy of mention is the background music by the Genioh Yamashiro Gumi, an eccentric concoction of percussion, electronics, chimes, and chanting.  Like the movie, it thunders through the speakers with an aggressive, fast-forward pace and bizarre, surreal tones, ranging from energetic to mellow.  It sounds like an unconventional accompaniment to such a movie, but it works.<br /><br />The film is considered the pinnacle of Japanese animation, yet, as with many of the greatest films of our time, it has had its share of detractors.  In particular, it took me more than one viewing to finally accept AKIRA.  I first saw the movie when I was thirteen, totally unprepared for such a violent, confusing yet beautiful animated movie.  To be honest, I disliked it.  When I saw the movie again five years later, it wasn't the bloodletting or the plot that offended me, but the dubbing (not produced, but released by Streamline Pictures), which grated on my ears and ranks as the worst English Anime dub I ever heard.  (To those of you who are fans of that dub who may be reading this, I'm sorry, but I absolutely can't stand listening to it again.)  But after obtaining this more polished, professional sounding version by Geneon/Pioneer (more on that later), I at last came to accept AKIRA as a remarkable achievement in animation with strong, universal messages resonating within its turbulent, gory nature and multi-layered storyline.  Even so, I wouldn't recommend this movie for the casual fan, but for animation buffs and as an exercise in artistry, action, and morality for adults, few films match AKIRA as a worthy contender in that category.<br /><br />As for this Special Edition DVD release, I have to tip my hat off to Geneon/Pioneer for putting a lot into remastering (and retranslating) this controversial classic.  The video quality is amazing, but not quite perfect; there are still some specks I could spot on the print, but these are very insignificant considering how gorgeous the print looks.<br /><br />The biggest improvement, however, has to be the English re-dub. Produced by the folks responsible for top-quality productions for shows such as COWBOY BEBOP and OUTLAW STAR, this new version is superior to the original in every way. The new English cast is talented and give it their all, and their efforts are amply supported by a script which is not only more coherent but faithful in spirit and meaning to the subtitles.  (Using a direct literal translation in a dub can sometimes result disastrously, but this happens to be an exception.)  The only weakness is that the spoken lines do not always mesh with the moving mouth since AKIRA's original Japanese dialogue was, unlike most Anime, recorded BEFORE animation began (hence why the animation is obviously synched more to the Japanese language track).  While this new version may not be perfect, it certainly comes close, and everyone involved obviously cared about this legendary film to do it justice.  The Japanese language track is included on the DVD set as well, but it's in 2.0 and not 5.1.  (Note: A recent re-release has the Japanese track remastered to DTS 5.1.)<br /><br />It's the special features, however, that make this edition of AKIRA deserve its subtitle. There's absolutely everything you'd want to know about this film -- a \\"making-of\\" documentary, a 20-minute short on the creation of the music, an interview with Otomo, three excellent featurettes about the remastering process, and a very helpful, informative glossary. There's also a \\"capsule feature\\", where a capsule appears once in a while on the screen, and you can highlight it to learn even more interesting facts on the film.<br /><br />Bottom-line:  even if you are a non-fan of this movie, you are invited to check out this DVD release.ial Edition DVD release, I have to tip my hat off to Geneon/Pioneer for putting a lot into remastering (and retranslating) this controversial classic.

B00005JMYI|5.0|Anchorman is definatly not for everybody's tastes. Rauncy, wild and completely out of control, it's nothing like Elf, nor half the innocent romance of Bewitched. Rather, Will Ferrell parades, struts and otherwise flaunts himself at the idea of being serious. Thought to be immature, this comedy can only be enjoyed if you are prepared not to sit down to a very intelligent and sophisticated movie. If you already know that, you're now ready to watch this movie.<br /><br />Will Ferrell plays Ron Burgandy, a anchorman who is insanely vain, and loved by the people.Its more of a boys club in the news room as his three other buddys Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd,Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and Champ Kind( David Koechner) do everything except blatantly make fun of the rest of their coworkers. All is fun and games until the boss hires Veronica Corningstone (Christine Applegate.) Its open war between the sexes, a war which becomes even more heated when the unfortunate Veronica finds herself the sole object of adorations from the infatuated Ron Burgandy. But love will have its speed bumps, and this perfect couple is no exception. What happens is comic magic.<br /><br />With Cameos from Ben Stiller, Luke Wilson, Danny Trejo, Jack Black, and Vince Vaugn there is no stopping the hilarity. If you love Will Ferrell, then I highly recommend this movie.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|When I first watched \\"Van Helsing\\" my initial reaction was that it wasn't that great, it was just average.  Upon thinking about it, and rewatching the film, I have changed my opinion to some extent.  While still not the best movie ever, but for a monster movie it does a very nice job.  Plus the idea of bringing together iconic film monsters, such as; Dracula, the Wolfman, Frankenstein, and even Mr. Hyde making a cameo, was a unique idea and one that director Stephen Sommers pulled off magnificently.    \\"Van Helsing\\" follows the adventures of a vampire hunter named Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman), who first appeared in Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula.  Now Van Helsing hunts more than merely vampires, as he takes on various monsters for a secret organization within the Catholic Church that seeks to rid the world of evil in all it's forms.  Through his journey he comes across the lovely Anna (Kate Beckinsale), a kindred spirit for Van Helsing, and together they must stop Dracula and his minions from destroying anymore lives than they already have.    The concept of bringing together so many of Hollywood's classic movie monsters in one movie seemed like an idea that would never see fruition.  As cool as the idea was there just didn't seem to be a director, let alone a special effects house that would be able to do justice to so many epic characters.  That is, until director Stephen Sommers resurrected the classic monster, the mummy, for his big budget films \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"The Mummy Returns\\".  The films did so well that they even spawned a spin-off that served as a prequel of sorts to the franchise, called \\"The Scorpion King\\".  With a director that was adept at reinvigorating classic monsters, Universal Studios saw the chance to bring more of their classic monsters to life, thus \\"Van Helsing\\" was born.    With the enormous success of `The Mummy' franchise and now with \\"Van Helsing\\", director Stephen Sommers is proving himself to be Hollywood's go-to-guy for monster movies.  With good acting and a good storyline that blends so many of Hollywood's classic monsters together without rushing any of them, this really is an enjoyable monster flick.  Now that the origin is essentially out of the way for this updated version of Stoker's classic vampire hunter, it will be interesting to see where this franchise will go in future installments.  Since, \\"Van Helsing\\" was successful, it is conceivable that Universal Studios would move forward with a sequel, so here's hoping for another great adventure in \\"Van Helsing 2\\".    \\"Van Helsing\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, language, and minor sensuality.
055357342X|5.0|Many of the preceeding reviewers have mentioned and praised this book as the best example of greatness in the fantasy genre, but to me, this book transcends the genre and is one of the best books written by an American author. As heartbreaking and tragic as this book is, it's also amazingly rewarding, often hilarious, and brutally mesmerizing. The battle scenes are ferocious but they are also terrifying because every time one happens the reader is transfixed and hoping that his/her favorite character will not get killed: in this book it is entirely possible. Do yourself a huge favor and read the first 2 books before this one as you will know the character as well as your best friends. While A Game of Thrones and Clash of Kings are also amazing novels, Storm of Swords beats both of them in terms of sheer emotion and memorable scenes.         The last chapter (slight spoiler) in which Sansa (a girl who has been apart from her whole family and had all she loved basically destoyed) builds a snow castle  that represents her ruined home is as touching as anything I have read from the great classics. And the notorious Red Wedding makes you want to scream and cry at the same time. (end spoiler)         Sometimes people say that all the characters are ambiguious and way too grey. You simply do not know whom to root for. Well this is true to some extent, but there are still characters you smply fall in love with. Jon, for example, is a character who clearly represents all that is good, and while he has some flaws, they are nothing compared to some other characters that populate this book. He (and a few others such a Dany) becomes almost a shining light amidst a dark and stormy sea.                  Read these books, love these books.
B0001MDPVS|4.0|...If you've only recently become a Nas fan, and you don't own Illmatic, this album is a must-buy. After 10 years, Illmatic is still the blueprint of east-coast rap. Nas has been, and still remains one of the best lyricists in the game. It's true this album is very short, but in most cases, long doesn't always mean GOOD, and Nas keeps it short and sweet here. If you haven't heard classics like 'Life's a B****' (featuring AZ), and 'The World is Yours', you haven't listened to real east-coast hip-hop.<br /><br />Like I mentioned earlier, this album is perfect if you don't already own Illmatic for some reason, because it's the original album, with upgraded sound quality. The remixes and unreleased tracks could have been better though, but they are still a nice addition. So spend a few extra bucks and pick this one up instead of the original, it IS worth it.
B00005JK8K|3.0|Not a bad movie but not a great one either. Nicholas Cage was totally over the top as Hollywood demands. Adam Beach was handsome of course, but with only three facial expressions - grimace, smile and grimace. <br /> <br />The most significant line in the whole movie, about the Japanese on Saipan, was set in the briefing room in the presence of the two Native American codetalkers, \\"It's their country and we're gonna take it from em\\", which was acknowledged by the cheering soldiers. <br /> <br />The sickening Irony was not lost on me. I wonder if anyone else noticed? <br />
B00005JNSK|2.0|The biggest mistake I made in preparing myself to see this movie was incorrectly assuming that it would be a remake of the Wilder movie, rather than a fresh interpretation of Dahl's book.<br /><br />Understand that I feel the Wilder version of this movie is an absolute classic.  This movie failed for me in several large aspects.<br /><br />The first problem I had was the lack of music; I greatly enjoyed the songs in the previous movie- all of them, not just the often over-played Oompa Loompa theme.  This movie does not contain ANY of the songs from the prior movie- \\"The Candyman\\", \\"Cheer Up, Charlie\\", and \\"I've Got a Golden Ticket\\" are all missing.<br /><br />The second problem I had was the changes in the plot.  Don't misunderstand me- the problem is not that there were changes, because the Wilder movie was not entirely faithful to the book, either.  For starters, Burton tries to explain Wonka's estrangedness with an odd backstory based on his father being a dentist, but it simply wasn't enough for me.  Wonka as played by Depp is absolutely twisted, but the backstory explanation is not believable for the amount of twisting it seems to have done to Wonka (more on Wonka's character soon).  In addition, the ending is significantly changed, but it becomes cheesy and feels like it was added on as an afterthough.  Finally, early in the trip through the factory, Wonka hints at something much more sinister going on when he refuses to properly answer the children's questions concerning how the Oompa-Loompas already had a choreographed song-and-dance for the first child's demise.  I assumed that this addition would lead to an appropriate revelation much later in the movie, but none was ever given.  This was a huge disappointment, because the story options opened up by this idea were fabulous, and I felt they were largely neglected.<br /><br />My biggest problem, however, is Depp's performance.  I understand that Burton is a dark producer- I like Burton, and I have seen his movies before.  But the interpretation given here of Depp is entirely unsatisfying.  Depp is cold and detached, and he displays no love for any of the children.  Wilder played a saviour to poor Charlie Bucket in the old version; in this version, I feel more pity for Charlie because I am disappointed to see his hopes for the golden ticket wash up with a sad, lonely, and depressing Wonka.  Wilder's portrayal of Wonka was a friend and a warm character; Depp is just disturbing.  I have seen many people say he is reminiscent of Michael Jackson, and I could not agree more.  I wonder, really, if Depp took his inspiration from MJ.  Frankly, I find it hard to fall in love with the character of Michael Jackson and I miss the whimsical yet friendly Willy Wonka of the Wilder movie.<br /><br />Despite all of this, the movie has good points.  The scenes leading up to the chocolate factory (around the first half of the movie) are tremendous.  I actually teared up for Charlie on several occasions, and I had very high hopes for the rest of the movie.  I daresay the first half of the movie is near perfect, but things really begin to go awry when Depp steps on-stage.  That is painful for me to write, because I feel Depp is a wonderful actor, but I am afrad that he ruins this movie.  I would have greatly preferred, in retrospect, to see Robin Williams in the role of Wonka.seen his movies before.  But the interpretation given here of Depp is entirely unsatisfying.

My husband kept hearing me laugh out loud and got interested.  I then found myself reading passages...then chapters out loud to him.  I am off to find the next book to see how Becky continues on her crazy journey of shopping and utter madness! <br /> <br />Buy it!  You will not regret it.  Then pass it along to a friend!
0380807343|4.0|Neil Gaiman has written another great book.  This one is about a young lady, Coraline, who has moved to a new house in London with her mother and father.  You find out the young lady is bored because both of her parents are too busy to play with her. Coraline finds a door that has been bricked up and she is told that it leads to nowhere.  Except that the door leads to an alter world that looks just like her own except something is not quite right.  The house looks the same and the people that live in the house are caricatures of the her true house.  There is also a secret Coraline has to figure out. <br /> <br />Gaiman has written a childrens book in the style of both \\"Narnia\\" and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\".  The \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" theme has also shown in his book \\"Neverwhere\\" and has some of the same flavor as this book.  The difference is that \\"Coraline \\" has been written for children.  It is a very good book for the kids and it is quite enjoyable for adults.  The story line and character dvelopment is not quite on the level of adult books, but the sketchiness also leaves open to broader interpretation for the reader.  The book is both simple on the surface and yet full of deaper meanings.  Coraline is a hero seen through the eyes of a child.  That is how this book should be judged. Throught the eyes of a child on its own merits.  Coraline is both scary and yet it is also fun.  Give this good book to a child if you want them to enjoy what they will read.  Highly Recommended.
B000002G89|5.0|I really like this album, I used to not but I grew into it. The album opens with the rockin' cover Motherless Children. Give Me Strength is alot softer, but just as good. I also like Willy and the Hand Jive, but don't think much of Get Ready, a worthless duet. I Shot the Sheriff proves that Clapton can play some good Marley, too. I Can't Hold Out is a nice blues-rocker. Please Be With Me and Let It Grow make up the album's one-two punch, both fine songs. Steady Rolling Man proves Clapton's love for Robert Johnson, and Mainline Flordia is a winner. Great work by Clapton.
B00006HBUB|3.0|This was not a great movie in any way, yet somehow there was something appealing to it which made it not the worst movie I have ever witnessed.  You walk into this film with a level of expectancy.  You want to see the same characters, stories, and clich&eacute;d moments that you did while watching the television show, and you do.  The characters are creative, the story is very similar to the cartoon, and the clich&eacute;d moments are there in full force.  Coming from a household that used to religiously watch this cartoon, I wanted this level of security, and I found it in this film.  As a film watcher, I don't want to see the director of this film taking too many original risks and really destroying the culture of the cartoon.  It stayed true to its roots, and for that you cannot fault this film.  There were some humorous moments that made you think back to the cartoon, there were silly times where you just had to shrug and breathe in deeply, then there were some horrid moments that really just made you reach for the STOP button on your DVD player.  Yet, I was expecting this.  So, coming from an expectancy perspective, it was perfect.  Coming from an entertainment value, it could have been a bit tighter.<br /><br />To begin, the actors.  I agree that a remake like this may not have garnished the cream of the crop of Hollywood hitters, but I believe we could have done a bit better than Freddy Prinze, Jr. and Matthew Lillard.  Sarah Michelle Gellar, I believe, could have been better as well.  Here we have some \\"C\\" level players who are a huge hit with the teen audiences, bringing to life characters, which were created during an older generation's time.  It just seemed a bit jumbled to me.  Then, to make matters even more confusing, we had the famed Rowan Atkinson as the sneaky Spooky Island owner.  Disappointing acting coupled with the great Mr. Bean doesn't quite fit for me.  He should have been used so much more to his potential.  He could have stolen this film from the others and made it into his own, but for some strange reason, bland acting breeds more bland acting, so you can't expect much.<br /><br />Outside of the acting, there isn't much else going on.  Nearly everything that happens we have seen time and time again through the cartoons.  Not much originality was brought into this film, while it felt like the money that should have gone to the creative department, was spent instead on sub-par CGI.  Scooby looked horrible.  I believe there was one instance where I could literally see right through him.  Then, you have these un-storied creatures that look like Donnie Darko's rejects.  Coupled with an annoying Scrappy-Doo.  There was potential in the CGI, but it seemed as if they low-balled and went with cheap CGI to appease the smaller child audiences.  The jokes needed to be planted deeper into the series.  I remember watching The Brady Bunch movie and laughing because the jokes just seemed to play off the taboo of the series.  I believe more focus on this with the Scooby-Doo movie would have raised this review another notch.<br /><br />Overall, I felt cheap after watching this film.  It wasn't a horrible film (though there was quite a bit of poor graphics and acting) because it gave you what you wanted when you walked in.  It gave you a mystery, the clich&eacute;d and overused structure of the original series, and that final moment when the true villain is revealed.  It followed a structure that I wanted, and I am \\"ok\\" with that for this film.  Normally, I would have asked for better, but there are some cartoons that do not need their internal structure tampered with.  Scooby-Doo was worth the one viewing, but I cannot say that I will ever be pleased to see it again.  The fact that there was the horrendous farting contest in the center of the film destroyed the entire experience for me.  That was the kind of humor I was not prepared for, nor did I feel it best represented the series.  The Mark McGrath cameo also did it in for me, but that my friend ... well ... is another story.  If you have never seen this film I suggest it once, but I do not feel that it needs a second viewing.  Scooby-Doo is alive, but in an animated version that continues to create laughter and creativity ... unlike this shoddy film.<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****but that my friend ... well ... is another story.

0930289528|3.0|With a fictional \\"hero\\" based on the 17th century terrorist Fawkes, this comic book novel has now been turned into a multi-million dollar special effects movie from the same production team that brought you the \\"Matrix\\" movies (the film is to be released in November 2005 to correspond with Fawkes [failed] November attack on the British Parliament in London).   The timing for the release of this movie is simply amazing, right after the \\"real world\\" terrorist attacks on London. <br /> <br />In the \\"real world\\", the fascist/nazi regime of Adolf Hitler (WWII) also believed in terrorism and vengeance.  In fact, Hitler named his flying bomb missiles, the ones that hit London day and night, V1's and V2's.  The \\"V\\" stood for \\"Vengeance\\".  Hitler's strategy was to \\"terrorize\\" the British people with his \\"V\\" weapon attacks.  Of course, as we know from history, Great Britain did not surrender to Germany.  Hitler's \\"terror war\\" on London failed. <br /> <br />So, in this comic book novel the tables have been turned.  The fascist/nazi types now rule Britain, Hitler has won WWII, and from within Britain comes the anarchist \\"hero\\" of the story, the modern day Fawkes, who bombs the Jordan Towers in London, etc.  Of course, as we've heard so many times, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter, etc.    <br /> <br />How will this story of terrorism be received on the big screen in today's post \\"9/11-Madrid bombing-London bombing\\" world?  <br /> <br />Will the modern day audience admire and cheer the terrorist \\"hero\\" of this comic book novel or not?
B00003CXB2|5.0|A great film that shows the world one of the real odd birds that the British Military puts out every once in a while. Men like Gordan, Wingate & Clive who you don't really know where to place them. But none the less they are very valuable men to have around in a tight place. This film takes the story of Lawrence as he goes from a raw junior Officer to Desert Legend. While it could of been very easy to make it one of those Ripping Good storys about one of the lads winning the war by themself in Arabia. The story resists this impluse and so makes itself a legend in itself. I can not praise this film too highly!
B000000WA2|5.0|This album was quite good, yet in my opinion not quite as good as Blur's self-titled album. A number of songs on here discuss the life of a fictional character, some being rather childish yet at the same time likeable. Many tracks also feature some sort of horn, also. I would most recommend the song \\"Fade Away\\", which has a unique beat and an almost circus-like off key horn melody which is slightly eerie yet enjoyable. Aside from this song, there are numerous other great incomparable songs, a strange booklet, and interesting lyrical features. I would recommend this album to any Blur fans out there, as well as those of any rock genre. <br />I recommend: <br />Stereotypes <br />Country House <br />Charmless Man <br />Fade Away <br />Top Man <br />The Universal <br />Mr. Robinson's Quango <br />He Thought Of Cars <br />It Could Be You <br />Ernold Same <br />Globe Alone <br />Entertain Me <br />

B000003TBP|5.0|I fully agree with those that say this album is one of Beck's best. Although this album has an overwhelming amount of `a' words (which I sure ain't a fan of), the sampling skills of Beck are colossal, with harmonica patterns, echo-drums, funky voices, and soulful saxophones being blended into his music. The song that I like most on Odelay is actually not one of the three hits, but one called \\"Hotwax\\". This song features a lazily played string instrument, distorted harmonica noises and vocals, the famous senseless Beck lyrics, a piece from what would seem to be a 40's movie, and other neat sampled rhythms. This album has a lot of variety, from country to hard rock to laid back peaceful melodies. I would recommend this album to Beck fans especially, but also to rock fans. Odelay is a very well constructed C.D. in my opinion and is certainly worth checking out. <br />I recommend: <br />Devil's Haircut <br />Hotwax <br />Lord Only Knows <br />The New Pollution <br />Novacane <br />Where It's At <br />Minus <br />Sissyneck <br />Readymade <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So.  Firefly?  Not your typical sci-fi.  Not even close. <br /> <br />This show may have been promoted as a \\"space western\\", but that has little to do with why I love it.  Forget any preconceptions you might have about its premise -- what's important is that this show is a storehouse of wit, drama, great dialogue, and gorgeous cinematography.  Best of all is its ensemble, which is possibly my favorite out of all the shows that I have ever watched.  Here, Whedon has developed nine compelling characters whose relationships and intentions are never black-and-white.  I cannot say enough about them, especially the siblings -- fiercely protective Simon and his damaged sister River.  Their ship Serenity is all about the unexpected -- it's a place where the mechanic is a cheerful prairie girl and the onboard Companion (aka prostitute) has the most class of the entire crew.  Together, their heists and exploits make for an expert mix of comedy, action, and mystery.  Additionally, the show leaves room for romantic pairings: the ups and downs of Zoe and Wash, tension between Mal and Inara, and the burgeoning relationship between Simon and Kaylee. <br /> <br />The season gets off to a modest start, and the first few episodes might strike viewers as nothing special.  In fact, I think the weakest episode of this set is Bushwhacked, simply because the plot is not compelling enough to fill an hour and ends up dragging.  It says a great deal about the quality of this show, however, that I have nothing but praise for the rest.  Just keep watching -- it's the later episodes following Shindig that truly distinguish Firefly as brilliantly written and plotted.   My favorites include Out of Gas, which contains flashbacks to how Mal chose his crew, and Objects In Space, a dreamlike episode that centers around River.  And even after the series is over, the special features are just as entertaining.  It's immediately evident how much the cast and crew enjoyed working on and discussing this show, which makes the features and commentary more than just a few perfunctory exercises. <br /> <br />My only major criticism of this series is that the Chinese pronunciation (a result of the futuristic premise) is atrocious, which can be very distracting.  And while nothing integral is said in Chinese, it can be aggravating for both non-speakers and speakers to miss some dialogue.  I'm a native speaker, and even I wish this set had been accompanied by a translation guide.  Even so, that's a small price to pay for 14 hours of solid television. <br /> <br />If you're still hesitant, borrow the DVD's from a friend, rent discs from Netflix, etc.  Leave your preconceptions at the door, and there's a good chance you'll end up buying this set.  (That or singing rounds of \\"The Hero of Canton\\" all day.)   I know that Firefly might not be the show for everyone, but it certainly deserves that chance.  And with Serenity's upcoming release and the reairing marathon on Sci Fi, there has never been a better time to give it a try. <br />
B00001SIES|5.0|This C.D. at first did not appeal to me past two songs, but it grew on me eventually until I loved almost every track. The songs on this album have obviously been very meticulously designed, for there are so many effects of sound, complex backing patterns, and the lyrics are articulated to often be eerie and make you want to ponder their meanings. Also, it is spectacular how high vocalist Matt Bellamy's Voice can go on the song Showbiz; he's like a banshee! The tune, anyway, that I would most recommend on this album is \\"Muscle Museum\\", which has a Greek-sounding instrument, piano, hard guitars, an eerie raindrop instrument effect, and a simple but catchy vocal pattern. Showbiz is the best I've heard from Muse yet, and I would recommend it to all of the band's fans, alternative rock fans, and plain old rock fans. It's great! <br />I recommend: <br />Sunburn <br />Muscle Museum <br />Fillip <br />Cave <br />Showbiz <br />Uno <br />Sober <br />Overdue <br />Escape <br />
B0001ZX0OW|2.0|PLUSES: Tim Robbins throroughly deserved his Oscar as this was the best character and on screen performance of his career. The movie was 130 minutes and for 120 minutes it was riveting, emotional, AND had you on the edge of your seat.  I was fully enthralled with all the characters and the plot development.  All the performances were excellent (with the exception of Laura Linney -- see minuses) and it was a great cast. I liked Laurence Fishburne's portrayal, as he was the extreme opposite of Kevin Bacon, being the unbiased, hard nosed cop, while Bacon had emotional ties to the case and his old friends to deal with. Sean Penn was superb, but I'm not sure about him being Oscar worthy. <br /> <br />MINUSES: Laura Linney's Boston accident was horrible!! Also, in my opinion, her character turned out to be the coldest of the entire movie. Her speech and scene with Penn at the end was utterly unwatchable, disgusting, and revolting! The 120 great minutes of this movie was rolling along and going to be in my top 50 movies of all time. Then I got to this scene and the movie went to not even making my top 500 list. This scene, her character, and her performance were all UTTERLY UNFATHOMABLE!!! Highly unbelievable and contrived! The rest of the movie kind of fell apart in a bad way after that scene, and never recovered. The amount of cold people and cover-ups (7 people involved??) that happened in the last few minutes was completely implausible. <br /> <br />Boom, then it's over. Recommended, but not one to cherish, re-watch, or keep in your collection.
B000003TAW|1.0|It would seem that Weezer's recent track \\"Beverly Hills\\" is one of few I like from the group, for this album didn't really appeal to me at all. In many cases, especially for track #9 (Holiday), the lyrics are hugely lame, sometimes trying to fit the word \\"anyway\\" into one syllable, or choosing the topic of destroying sweaters. Despite this, I was able to mildly enjoy two tracks on this C.D., one of them being \\"Buddy Holly\\". This tune is a blend of hard guitars and a melody somewhat similar to Waltzing Matilda. Once again the lyrics are pretty uninteresting, but the progressions and all are fairly good. This song  and many of the other tracks are actually very similar to The Ramones, for the chord progressions used are often simple, and when combined with the vocals have a very comparable feel. I would definitely not recommend Weezer's blue album, for what this band is doing on it isn't all that exciting. <br />Recommended tunes: <br />Buddy Holly <br />Undone- the Sweater Song <br />
B00001OH7G|5.0|Rory, Rory, Rory - stunning, stunning, stunning.  And the remastered CD is a champion job, just like all the other original album refreshers.  All the moods are here - slide rock, slow blues, reflective sadness, acoustic tenderness.  And some blistering solos.  Try the blazing soulfulness of Tatoo'd Lady, or get lost in the delicious meandering (in the best sense of that word)of the solos in Walk on Hot Coals. Or the slow intensity of A Million Miles Away.  Nice one Rory, nice one son, let's have another one, as the fans chant at the end of Who's that Coming?  If you like 70s blues rock, and want to find a timeless live album - here it is!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|If Mr. Plant would have produced this masterpiece as his first solo effort after the awe inspiring Led Zeppelin, I believe it would have been more consistant with his roots, growth and more of what I would have expected. Having said that, THIS record is too far ahead of THAT time so he couldn't have done it then, thus it did not happen that way. So, here we are with one of the best cd's to come out in some time. My copy has the \\"Shine it all around\\" remix on it and is the coolest 7 minutes I've heard recorded in awhile. The innovation, experimentation and experience that shines through on this effort by Mr. Plant is just what I would expect from a man of his talent and experience. Mature, well written, amazingly diverse and full of texture keeping my interest throughout. Energetic rock tunes, deep thought provoking tunes, soundscape tunes. It's all here. Probably not much you're going to hear on the top 40 local station, but we all know what a compliment that truly is (although it could and should happen). This is not a cd that a musician rushes through to meet contract deadlines or to try and bring back a burned out career. This is a cd that shows what a muscision of skill and experience can do when he/she gives a damn about what it means to be call a musician. Folks, I believe numetal and copy cat bands with shallow lyrics and music straight from the cookie cutter record company money machine of late are on their way out. We've got some heavy hitters giving us what we want and need. Quality rock music. Mr. Plant if you ever happen to read this humble opinion as regards your CD \\"Might Rearranger, I'd just like to say. Thank you.
B00006JDVV|4.0|Very few movies tackle the subject of dragons due to the costly expense of making the creatures come to realistic life.  However, a couple of movies have succeeded in doing this, the first movie to successfully bring a dragon to life was the somewhat campy, action-fantasy \\"Dragonheart\\", starring Dennis Quaid and Sean Connery.  The second film to succeed with the subject of dragons is \\"Reign of Fire\\".  \\"Reign of Fire\\" takes a more realistic, less fantastical approach to the subject matter, therefore lending a sort of credibility, and real-world feel to the film. <br /> <br />\\"Reign of Fire\\" is set in London, at some point in the not-so distant future.  12 years before the events that dominate the story, a dragon was awakened from its slumber, unleashing a reign of terror that has not ceased for over a decade, bringing us to the present day where a man named Quinn (Christian Bale), whom along with a group of refugees fight the dragons to stay alive.  Joining them in the fight against the firebreathers, is the mysterious and hot-headed military man, Van Zan (Matthew McConaghey).  As a power struggle ensues between Quinn and Van Zan, the humans must attempt to defeat the dragons, without killing each other. <br /> <br />Director Rob Bowman (director of Elektra) delivers what is probably the best dragon movie to this date.  With stunningly realistic CGI dragons that will leave you breathless.  This film has solid acting from all of the actors, the two leads in particular, and a very good story tying all of the action together.  \\"Reign of Fire\\" is a non-stop, explosive thrill ride that never lets up.   <br /> <br />\\"Reign of Fire\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B0000AMJED|1.0|This movie was really bad.. The worst part was when the main character attempeted to use some urban slang. I damn near broke my remote trying to turn it so fast.
B00005JKCH|5.0|After almost a decade of legal battles, Sony Pictures was finally able to move into production the comic book adaptation of Marvel's popular hero Spiderman.  Though once the legality was straightened out, a new problem presented itself, leaving Sony with the question of \\"Who will direct and star in this picture?\\"  The answer took some time, and while the question loomed in Hollywood, the rumor mill was going crazy.  For a while most of the rumors surrounded who would star in the film, since James Cameron was tapped to direct for the longest time.  Names for who would star ranged from Leonardo DiCaprio to Luke Perry, I believe even Kurt Russell was rumored for a little while (though he would be too old).  Frankly all of the rumors for the cast stunk, I figured that Hollywood was just going to screw up what could possibly redeem the comic book to film genre, a genre that hadn't existed since it's untimely demise at the hands of \\"Batman & Robin\\" and \\"Spawn\\".  Thankfully, God had to have been smiling on this movie, as all casting rumors were debunked, including James Cameron as director (though I would have been happy with him behind the camera).  With this announcement it was revealed that director Sam Raimi (director of the `Evil Dead' series) would direct the movie, and Tobey Maguire would fill the dual role of Peter Parker/Spiderman (this choice scared many comic book fans, there was no doubt that Tobey could fill the geeky shoes of a pre-Spiderman version of Peter Parker, but once he got his powers, Tobey's weak, thin frame would not do the trick).  Needless to say all concerns were soon swept away when Spiderman was released to theaters amidst considerable praise from critics, movie audiences, and comic book fans alike.  With the success of \\"X-Men\\" and then \\"Spiderman\\" we had entered a new era in movie history, a time in which comic books could be adapted to film and treated with realism and respect.    \\"Spiderman\\" as both comic and non-comic book fans know, is the story of mild-mannered nerd Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spiderman), who during a science class gets bitten by a radioactive spider.  This spider bite sends the radioactivity into Parker's system, giving this puny man of science the proportionate strength and abilities of a spider.  Peter discovers his newfound abilities and embraces them, he sees them as a means to which he can win the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and also improve his lot in life.  However, Peter's hopes and dreams would soon come crashing down around him, when after competing in a wrestling event for money, Peter chooses not to stop a thief that ran right by him with the victim in close pursuit.  Unfortunately for Peter this decision will haunt him for the rest of his life, when his beloved Uncle Ben is shot down in a carjacking by the very same thief that Peter could have stopped.  This action causes Peter to learn his most valuable lesson, \\"With great power comes great responsibility\\", and also leads to Peter becoming the web-swinging, wall-crawling hero, Spiderman.  As this all occurs, billionaire industrialist Norman Osborn (Wilem Dafoe as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin), is being forced out of his own company, Oscorp, by the board members, due to his failure to snag a multi-billion dollar weapons contract with the U.S. military.  The cause of the failed agreement was an unstable strength enhancing drug, Osborn overwrought with hatred and self-pity for being forced out of his company tests the drug on himself, creating the deranged, psychopathic Green Goblin.  With Norman as the Green Goblin he sees the need to eliminate those who wronged him and his company and then take control of New York City.  However, Spiderman isn't about to let this happen, not without a fight.    After the huge success of Fox Studios' \\"X-Men\\", Sony Pictures really had their work cut out for them, as all eyes were on whether or not another comic book adaptation could succeed.  Needless to say Sony Pictures' \\"Spiderman\\" passed the test with great ease, giving audiences a thrill-a-minute adventure that they would not soon forget.  With an impressive story, superb directing, incredible casting (Tobey Maguire's awesome performance of the dual roles of Peter Parker/Spiderman, being the biggest surprise), and a great soundtrack, \\"Spiderman\\" was an incredible comic book adaptation and heroic origin tale, that did what all movies (comic book and otherwise) should do, that is, leave the audience craving more.  As I said earlier, \\"Spiderman\\" praised, not only by critics and general audiences, but also the ever-so picky comic book fans, which is not an easy task.  If you enjoyed \\"X-Men\\", or the `Superman' films or the `Batman' films, then this movie is a definite must-see.  I guarantee that you will enjoy \\"Spiderman\\" over and over again.    \\"Spiderman\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B000002UDB|3.0|If it weren't for John Lennon's three brilliant compositions (I Am the Walrus, Strawberry Fields Forever & All You Need Is Love) and Paul's Penny Lane, this would be the worst Beatles album out there. I don't care how much fans like it, to me it sounds extremely dated. Whereas Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band all sound like they could've been recorded yesterday (As does Abbey Road, for that matter), Magical Mystery BORE sounds like...well, a 1967 recording. For example, listen to Fool on the Hill, Flying, Blue jay Way & Baby You're a Richman, none of which have held up well.<br /><br />But there are good moments. As I said before, John throws in two of the three best with Strawberry Fields and I Am the Walrus, not to mention All You Need Is Love, while Paul rises to the occasion with Penny Lane and (to a lesser extent) Hello Goodbye. Magical Mystery Tour is one of the few inessential Beatles albums, seeing that the five good songs can all be found on the Blue Album (1967-1970).
B000957O82|3.0|I went to see the movie in the theater.  Since I don't copy videos, I purchased this one (of many).  The credits, deleted scenes and other extras were skipping.  I could not see or hear what I missed in the movies.  Otherwise \\"Hitch\\" is a great movie. My husband told me not to bother sending it back, but I'll know better next time.<br /><br />Thank you,<br /><br />Mrs. Victoria J. Poller
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I am going to keep this short and sweet. Some well known critics have given Troy the \\"thumbs down\\" because of historical inaccuracies. To this I say \\"So what?\\" It isn't a PBS documentary...it is a huge, spectacular, and often thrilling epic movie, and how many people are devout students of Homer's Iliad anyway? If you view movies for entertainment, then give this one a try....you won't be disappointed. Brad Pitt portrays Achilles with a level of charisma and athleticism that will make you believe he truly is \\"the greatest warrior of his time\\". Huge amounts of talent, money, and effort were heaped upon this project, and it shows. The detailing of the city of Troy, the choreography of the battles, and the spectacular art direction...including the darndest Trojan Horse you will ever see, built exactly as it would have been. Rent it...buy it...borrow it...but most of all watch it. Don't let some critical snobbery keep you from an excellent movie.

1883217040|5.0|As a beginner jazz pianist, I have found this book really useful.  I also own Mark Levine's Jazz Piano book and another jazz piano book but have found this to be the most helpful.  I would greatly recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn more about jazz, it can be applied to any instrument.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|WOW...........what a great CD. I have been a fan of the book and was surprised to hear it has been turned into a Musical. <br /> <br />As we Australia do not get most Broadway production I was nervous to buy this CD, as I could not for the life of me work out how the great book could becoma a musical. <br /> <br />This CD has not been taken out of my player, and the transition of the story from book to music was so clever. <br /> <br />The songs and voices are great and really pulls you into the wonders and enjoyment of this great witty story. Lets hope us here in Sydney get the chance to see this show live......but hey we only have just got \\"the producers\\"....so a few years maybe
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I have always been a very devoted Phantom fan, so when i heard there was to be a movie i was concerned hollywood would ruin such a wonderful piece. when i first saw the movie i was foolish enough to try and compare to the original cast (which i was fortunate enough to see twice) but now that i have watched a few more times i have come to accept that they are very different, not necessarily making the movie bad. I am quite glad they did not completely change the story (like hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for example).... for those of us who need a release between theater seats this will be good to have in the collection.
B00001QGPS|4.0|meth and red can rip it.A lot of people at my school say they can't <br />rap but what do they know they think 50 cent can rap.But this album <br />could have used some better beats no diss to eric,rza,math,or rock <br />but they need better beats but go pick this up
B000059TFO|5.0|Excellent depiction of race problems in the south during the 1960s. Gene Hackman and William Dafoe would, at first, seem an unlikely team, however, it is their different personalities, as well as their different approaches to the situation, that give the movie a human touch. The dialog is crisp and original, especially between Mr. Hackman and the townspeople.
B00000255F|5.0|No-one in rock, and I mean no-one, writes stories to song like Springsteen. He's still doing it of course, with his brilliant new album Devils and Dust, but Born to Run reminds us that this has been his style for over a quarter of a century. What he does better than anyone else I can think of is draw you into the story, and make you really FEEL what's going on. The emotion on this album is unbelievable, from the youthful desperation of Thunder Road, to the triumph of the title track, to the utter, complete brilliance of Jungeland, which in my opinion is not only the best track of the album but a clear contender for 'best song ever written', (I know, I know, everyone goes for Born to Run and I perfectly understand why, but it only really reaches it's potential on the live album, whereas Jungleland achieves perfection on this studio recording). \\"Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge, drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain...from the churches to the jails, all is silence in the world...in the tunnels up town, the Rat's own dream guns him down...the poets down here don't write nothing at all, they just stand back and let it all be...they wind up wounded, not even dead, tonight in Jungleland\\"; did even Dylan ever write lyrics like this?<br /><br />This is one of those very few albums you never really get over hearing for the first time. It just changes your perception of what rock can do, and also of what life can be like. It draws you into its world and makes you want to be there, to know the people the songs are about. In fact, it makes it feel like you were there, like you do know them. If you have not got this album, you're missing out on something that stands shoulder to shoulder with Sargent Pepper, Blood on the Tracks, the fourth Led Zeppelin album, etc etc. (Actually, there aren't that many etceteras - not many albums make it to this level). Buy and enjoy!
B0000039PW|5.0|Anyone who doesn't acknowledge that this CD defined an era of hip-hop is foolish. Top to bottom this cd is incredible; beats, lyrics, prodcution, delivery...all top notch. <br /> <br />A very good place to start with rap if you want to give it a chance
0786856297|5.0|I just finished this book a few minutes ago.  It was wonderful.  I seemed to really connect with the characters, even the gods.  It will be exciting to see what this author does with the next book.  My favorite parts were when Perseus finally found a place where he felt he belonged, when he sent Medusa's head to Mount Olympus, his encounters with Ares, when he realized who his father was, and all the parts of his quest I haven't mentioned yet.<br /><br />This book is worth a read, it reminds me a bit of Harry Potter, but I feel anyone could enjoy it, even if they don't know much mythology(like me).
1572814349|5.0|This deck is soft, beautiful and absolutely worth the price. I was stunned by Kat Black's work on this deck: so fine, so careful, you can tell she just loves what she does. <br /> <br />I agree it is annoying seeing the \\"USGames\\" words in every card, it takes a little from the work Black has done, I wonder if they coulnd't find any other place to put their brand on. It seems a little disrespectful of the artist's work to me too. <br /> <br />In sum: it is a beautiful deck, with powerful symbolism, and definetly not a \\"flavour of the month\\" deck. This one's a keeper. <br />
0060989157|5.0|This book is AWESOME. Tommy was probably my favorite to read, because of his stories and such. I don't really have much to say, but if you are a fan of Motley Crue, I definitely reccommend this book. It's raunchy, rude, and worth the read.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album without a doubt, a Highly polished, Hardcore, Progressive Metal Gem that stands up to the grace and passion that great bands like Pink Floyd have commanded for years. <br /> <br />Not every person will have the same impression of this true piece of art, but it is a Fierce and Sturdy message that can both powerfully move you or just offer killer metal songs to enjoy. <br /> <br />Personally, I've had a very in depth experience with the album, but TOOL has always wanted you to take it in your own way. The album really is fabulously creative and I'd most definitely recommend this CD to anybody that appreciates metal or deep and influential experiences. <br /> <br />Lastly, Stinkfist probably won't be your favorite part of the album. In fact, it's all so good that most people don't have a favorite....but I do. It's Intermission/Jimmy. <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000066744|5.0|what a story...........magic...............great music.....heart-warming....one of the best films I ever saw and I am 49 years old!
B0000025RI|5.0|As a kid I listened to this album at least twice a day, everyday, for 5 straight years. I was 6 years old, and this all began in 1989. My point is that Thriller, hands-down the greatest album ever, is timeless. Artists in our era should note that Thriller only had nine tracks. We've all purchased albums with 20+ tracks, one amazing single, and the rest of the album isn't even listenable. Thriller proves the point that quality is much more important than quantity. \\"Billie Jean\\" could arguably be the best dance song ever. It was the song in which MJ debuted his gravity-defying moonwalk, and \\"Billie Jean\\" perfectly compliments his efforts.  Even though its difficult to choose, \\"Human Nature\\" is my favorite track on the album. MJ's lyrics are amazing, his pitch and tone are perfect, and the beat reminds me of Marvin Gaye's \\"Sexual Healing\\".    Its MJ's mix of upbeat pop hits, hard rock anthems, and sultry r&b ballads that make Thriller the best album ever. I recommend that any person who owns music should add Thriller to their collection.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This dvd is fabulous!  It is the greatest. I enjoyed this because I am a huge Eagles fan. I am so glad they produced the dvd for all to enjoy!  I would highly recommend this to all that love the eagles!  I have played it several times and enjoy it every time.
0671027387|2.0|Dan Brown seems to be on a crusade. First was his smash hit, the Da Vinci Code - a stunning example of market savvy, and, it seemed, an inside joke on his target audience: a clever way of \\"outing\\" wannabe, theophobic intellectuals (and there was no shortage of these) who gullibly swallowed his claim of investigative accuracy, not knowing that Brown had fudged numerous details, much in the way (one supposes) detectives withold key evidence to filter out crank callers on their tip lines. The spectacle of critics hailing his \\"impeccable research\\" must have given him many a chortle.<br /><br />But this book reveals the author's owned skewed reality, infused with what seems to be a frothing, partisan hatred that has blinded him from a key issue of the book. His venomous bent has resulted in one of the most ham-fisted portrayals I've ever seen: One of the key villains is a gay-hating, misogynous, adulterous, child-sacrificing ... Republican. Yes, once you've grasped the impossibility and utter ridiculousness of this one-dimensional character, everything else in the book takes on a cartoonish quality. Likewise the unquestioning special ops team which murders civilians willy-nilly. Of course, one must keep in mind the gullibility of his intended audience.<br /><br />Which is a shame, because in his naivete, Brown seems to have an ability to grasp some good technical detail, affording us some scientific detective work. Strangely, though, most of it is done by his female protagonist, who is singularly unqualified, but puts the true scientists to shame. Perhaps Brown's commentary on the state of the scientific enterprise. At the same time, he gives her the lamest, most puerile dialogue I've seen in a while. Brown just can't pull off smart, snappy, human banter. It's not all bad, but she just seems to be fed the worst of it.<br /><br />There is some interesting plotting, but halfway through the book you just want it to end, even the action and the Delta teams grisly comeuppance, which is all foreordained. The evil Republican continues to lie and generally disgust us throughout, while the Democratic president is the model of goodness and innocence. It's sad that Brown just couldn't resist this tirade of wish-fulfillment. Be assured, though, that this bad man gets his just desserts, o yes.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Brown is able to grasp specific areas of scientific knowledge, but seems unable to grasp the implications. One of the biggest holes has to do with the idea of panspermia, or the seeding of life on earth from space. He portrays this as the end-all of the question of life's origins, seeing as how conditions on earth could not have reasonably given rise to life spontaneously. But his scientists neglect to wonder how life arose elsewhere in the first place; it's just a non-issue for them. Apparently \\"from a rock in space\\" is good enough for his audience. However, if his success in \\"Code\\" was any indication of how much he has to worry about the possibility of critical thinking and fact-checking from his readers, this will indeed be a non-issue.<br /><br />Some of his descriptions of weapons and technology are interesting. Are they factual, as he claims? Who cares. I give him two stars for trying to write what could have been a thoughtful book, and only two stars for his partisan ranting.ppance, which is all foreordained.

B00005JNSK|2.0|Gawd that movie was annoying. I blindly thought it was a sequel where Charlie had grown up and was ready to pass the factory on to someone else. That would have made perfect sense a generation later. But no-- it was a freakin' remake of a classic. And a sad one at that. Johnny Depp's performance was stilted and lifeless, unlike Gene Wilder who was eccentric and endearing. No wonder he's bitter!  I guess the original had some deep meaning to me as a kid, and probably most of the kids today won't know the difference. But man did I sit there bored stiff. In fact the best part was the preview for Tim Burton's Corpse Bride.
0684857219|5.0|I don't understand people who say that his program doesn't work.  Muscle is muscle, and if you exercise it and rest it, it will grow.  It's also hard to argue with his results.  Sure, he might have a genetic advantage, but that doesn't mean his program is inferior.  And for $16, it's a great deal.   <br /> <br />Having said that, the book does have a few limitations.  For example, he recommends for your fat content to consist of only 20% of your calories, but his diet recommendation approaches 55%.   <br />Also, when looking for examples of exercises in his routine recommendation, you have to look in the index to find them.  He is also vague and/or contradictory about a few other subject matters, as well.  He states you should exercise aerobically a minimum of 30 minutes a day in one place, and then states that is the recommended maximum in another.   <br /> <br />However, for the vast amount of information for such a great price, it can't be beat.  Like any advice, take it and modify it to your personal goals and available schedule.  Even if some of it is questionable, it's still good to hear such a valued opinion.
B00097DX3U|1.0|If you liked their last album, I'm sure you'll like this one. But if you like rock music that makes you feel something, you already know that Audioslave sucks. This band is a painful reminder of what happens when artists get old and lose \\"it.\\" Anyone who listened to Rage Against the Machine or Soundgarden should clearly be able to tell within five seconds that this band is either phoning it in or has nothing left. These guys were talented and original - now they churn out radio-friendly fluff. I knew Tom Morello was on his way out since the Rage albums got progressively worse, but I really had hope for Cornell. Then his solo album came out, and after hearing that disaster, I guess Audioslave makes sense. Well, they're making money, so I guess hooray for them. Yay rock music industry.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|If you love the Eagles you love this show. I saw this tour 2 years ago and wanted to see it again and again. Now I can. The energy is great. The only criticism is that they are not as tight and polished as the Hell Freezes over DVD. But they still Rock! 2 DVDs. They are having so much fun and it shows. I love this DVD.
B000929AJQ|3.0|Not bad. Definitely some good moments, but it's missing the darkness and despair of The Downward Spiral. And that's natural, since the guy obviously has fixed up his life, grown up, has a few bazillion dollars and probably isn't completely miserable anymore. The production is excellent at always, but a lot of the songs don't really go anywhere interesting, and some of the choruses are pretty crappy. It's not a bad album, but it does have some of that tired aging artist feel to it.

B000000H5K|5.0|Even though \\"Chaos A.D.\\" was Sepultura's bravest and most innovative album (because it premiered a song which was an instrumental consisting entirely of acoustic guitars and tribal drums), I still consider \\"Roots,\\" Sepultura's sixth, their most experimental and creative work. This 1996 album was also Sepultura's last with frontman Max Cavalera; he would leave the group and go on to front a solo band, Soulfly. And, until 2004's \\"Prophecy,\\" \\"Roots\\" was also more experimental than anything Max would make in Soulfly.<br /><br />In addition to the aforementioned tribal drums and acoustic strumming, this album also features a Jew's harp, maracas, a Brazilian tribe, tin drums, and DJ scratching. But creativity came with a cost. \\"Roots\\" is still a heavy metal album, but the death metal is long gone, because (as was the case with \\"Chaos A.D.\\") these riffs are tinged with punk. Plus, since Max adopted Korn's downtuned guitars and had guest appearances, some fans think this album helped usher in nu-metal. I, however, still believe that the experimental aspects of \\"Roots\\" made it innovative. And Max may have been partially influenced by nu-metal, but he was equally as influenced by his own heritage/upbringing. (Max is from Brazil, thus explaining the Brazilian tribe, maracas, and tin drums.)<br /><br />\\"Roots, Bloody Roots\\" is the first single, probably the heaviest song on \\"Roots,\\" and is one of Sepultura's best known songs. It remains a staple of their live shows, and the success of this song has influenced some Soulfly songs (like \\"Prophecy.\\") Plus, Max has even adopted this song as his own, and played it during some Soulfly concerts. The album opens with the sound of crickets chirping, then this song launches into heavy, de-tuned guitar bluster. These guitars, which make a heavy churning and humming noise, are a big part of why this song is so heavy and catchy (even though there are some good vocal hooks, here, too). I enjoy how the beat comes down, then Max comes out of no where to let out one of his loud, ascending yells.<br />\\"Attitude\\" features guitars which are at first flamenco, then punching and pounding.<br />\\"Ratamahatta\\" is the song with the Brazilian tribe. It begins with what sounds like maracas and tribal drums. The guitars kick in and there's some catchy, aggressive scat in the background. The verses on this song are soft and restrained, making a good friction between the verses and heavy choruses.<br />\\"Breed Apart\\" has tin drums at the beginning, before turning to chunky, chug and churn guitars and vocals that alternate from supple growling to raging yells. The Jew's harp comes aboard and plays briefly over the beat, and the song ends with some static-sounding white noise.<br />\\"Spit\\" starts with (what sounds like) guitar feedback and some distant yelling (of \\"Un, dos, tres, cua!\\") The crunchy guitars eventually come to the front, and there are a few more of Max's heavy yells.<br />\\"Lookaway\\" has an instrument that could be a flute and a catchy drum beat, followed by DJ scratching (compliments of DJ Lethal-a DJ who would later join Limp Bizkit). Even though there are some guitars, this song's pace is about half as fast as the others. Two guest vocalists, Faith No More's Mike Patton and Korn's Jonathan Davis, make an appearance and sing/whisper over distant, dreary, ghost-like noises.<br />\\"Dusted\\" begins with a banging of the drum sticks, then the guitarists (Andreaas Kisser and Max Cavalera) make some of the heaviest and fastest guitar riffs since track one.<br />\\"Born Stubborn\\" has a beeping guitar noise which becomes increasingly fast and heavy, but some more tribal drums and Brazilian chants are tossed in near the end.<br />\\"Itsari\\" mixes more South American chants and maracas with acoustic guitar strums and soft hand percussion.<br />\\"Ambush\\" is highlighted by a nice breakdown of heavy, groove-y guitars, which comes after the song veers into soft, serene territory.<br /><br />So, this album further expanded Sepultura's innovation and it helped prove that these guys can do more than pound power chords and double bass drums. With \\"Roots,\\" Sepultura really came into their own, after stepping out of the shadows of other death metal bands, like Morbid Angel and Slayer.<br /><br />If you collect everything Max Cavalera or Sepultura, \\"Roots\\" obviously needs to be apart of your collection. And you should also check this album out if you're a diehard heavy or nu-metal fan. If you're new to the band, even though this is a great C.D., I wouldn't start here; I'd pick up \\"Chaos A.D.\\" and \\"Beneath the Remains\\" first.<br /><br />When Max was apart of this group, Sepultura were headed in quite a curious direction. \\"Roots\\" was their least heavy album, but it was also their most imaginative and experimental. One can't help but wonder what the next Sepultura album would have sounded like; would it have been a return to their death metal roots, or would it have been a straight forward, unapologetic nu-metal album? I don't know the answer, but whatever the case, I think Max, Andreaas, Igor, and Paulo would have had a hard time outdoing themselves and making an even more creative album than this.guys can do more than pound power chords and double bass drums.

B000002UVX|5.0|Hendrix was the great artist of our time. Sounds like he poured everything into these concerts, like Picasso must have when he created his masterpieces. Blistering, funky, loud, beautiful and above all unbelievably creative and inspiring. Band of Gypsys is awesome music.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I must confess that I didn't watch Smallville when it first premiered.  I thought, \\"another show about Superman.  Geez!\\"  There had already been Lois and Clark which I could never get into.<br /><br />I've always liked Superman, but part of what didn't appeal to me about him is that he's just too powerful.  I had wished that he was more vulnerable, more human, to make him a bit more interesting.<br /><br />My best friend, who had been watching the show faithfully from the beginning told me to give a try.  I did.  And wow, was I surprised, most pleasantly!<br /><br />Here, I'm exposed to Clark Kent as a young teenager (even though it's obvious that Tom Welling is not a teen) who hasn't even reached the pinnacle of his powers yet.  In fact, he's a young man struggling to cope with these strange abilities.  We find that he has strength and speed, but that's about it.  He has an invulnerability that isn't quite at full strength yet.  Bullets bruise him, and he can feel the heat of intense fire.<br /><br />Exploring the early years of Clark Kent is more compelling than I thought it would be.  How does a teenage boy from who knows where (since Clark doesn't know where he's from) cope with the mysteries of his origins and his upcoming powers.  We find that as with any young teen, Clark struggles to do what is right, live a \\"normal\\" life, trying to fit in socially with his friends while trying to maintain his secret.<br /><br />Still this series is about \\"believing to disbelieve.\\"  I mean, Metropolis in the middle of Kansas?  Clark grows up with a young Lex Luthor?<br /><br />Yet somehow, the writers make this work.  The meteor rocks effects upon the populace of Smallville was a great idea (even if they do overplay this card quite a bit as the series goes on).  It gives Clark some interesting people to fight who have been infected by the rocks.  Ironically, most those infected are teens as well.  We are able to draw comparisons of how a \\"normal\\" teen copes compared to how Clark copes.  As one may predict, the teens often find that too much power corrupts and they quickly begin to misuse their new-found gift.<br /><br />The cast is great in this show.  I do find Chloe a bit annoying and also the most unrealistic character.  How much access to information can a high school teen have?  She spends more time working on her paper than she does doing school work.  However, I find that Michael Rosenbaum brings a side of Lex Luthor that I've not yet seen on television or in the movies.  Lex is a good guy.  We find him battling his father, Lionel Luthor (and brilliantly portrayed by John Glover), and helping out his best friend, Clark Kent, even if he is also curious about the origins of his friend.  \\"The road to evil is a journey, not a light switch,\\" says Lex.  We see this a great, insightful line about how Lex will ultimately fall from grace.  Part of the appeal of the series is to see how the inevitable rift will form between Lex and Clark.<br /><br />There is also a great supporting cast in John Schnieder, Annette O'Toole, and Kristin Kreuk.  My only complaint is of the ill-used Sam Jones III as Pete Ross.  It appears the writers began to have a difficult time writing him into stories as Clark seems to have his hands full with Lex, Lana, and Chloe.<br /><br />If you're interested a fascinating \\"take\\" on the Superman saga, Smallville is a great place to do it.  Second and third season appearances by Christopher Reeve are treats indeed, as he also found an interest and fascination in Smallville.ften find that too much power corrupts and they quickly begin to misuse their new-found gift.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|As a former Napoleon Dynamite of my junior high and first two years of high school, I find this movie hysterical! For anybody who tried so hard to be cool (especially around your family) and look back now and cringe at the way you acted, you should get a kick out of this movie. Be advised, the humor is very dry...nothing like the comedy you find in Adam Sandler or Ben Stiller movies. Another huge bonus is that it is family friendly and people of all ages seem to enjoy it. <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale's jaw dropping performance in the Machinist is reason enough to see this film, which is undoubtadly one of the most haunting and unforgettable films to hit mainstream America in quite some time.  Bales' transformation from the buff, he-man-esque physique that those expect from seeing him in Batman Begins, Reign of Fire, or American Psycho, to the incredibly gaunt, emaciated Trevor Reznick is on par with the transformations that Robert De Niro went through in Raging Bull, and more recently Charlize Theron in Monster.  Reznick is a factory worker who hasn't slept in over a year, and feels a nagging sense of guilt.  His links to reality include a hooker (Jennifer Jason Leigh) whom he frequents, and an airport waitress (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n); and his relationships with both take a nose dive soon after there is a crippling accident involving a co-worker (Michael Ironside) that Reznick is responsible for, and a mysterious man named Ivan (John Sharian) who is following Reznick around and can't be seen by anyone else but him.  As the Machinist unfolds and it's secrets are gradually revealed, it's clear that not all is going to end well for Reznick, and as he spirals towards his breaking point, it's one hell of a trip going down with him.  Director Brad Anderson gives the film a gray/blue-ish, almost metallic look, masterfully weaving the lonely world Reznick lives in with little to no human contact.  Bale is masterful in both his performance and getting into his character, and the man well deserves an Oscar nomination.  All in all, the Machinist is a haunting film that is definitely not for everyone, but for those looking for a mind bending trip, look no further.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|The is one of those rare movies that uses incredibly imaginative characters, story, and setting to convey an extremely important message of environmental awareness. The scope is enormous, and at times hard for western minds to comprehend. The message is universal and so strong that is just adds to the beautiful animation and deeply artistic story.

And despite his pain and constant hunger he managed to wonder at the worlds he passed through and faced ongoing challenges with an almost cheerful logic. A wholly amazing and beautiful story.

0804102988|5.0|I am reading this one for the second time right now. This is an incredible, interweaving of British history and fiction, tracing five families that began at the end of the Ice Age, continuing on through the growth and evolution of England.  Though there are certainly some eras and characters one will like more than others, and for me, the best parts centered around the Black Plague, it is thoroughly readable, and perfect for the person that is interested in history, but not interested in poring over ten dry volumes of it. At the same time, a boring history buff like myself can turn to this for light reading and not feel like I have to pick over minor historical points. Rutherfurd put a lot of research into this and it shows. <br /> <br />Rutherfurd is easy to read despite the length of the book, and he really puts you there. Don't miss this one.
0788815490|4.0|<br />  This film ranks high in using great camera work, directing as well as color.

She is very perfect in the role she plays as well as a great actress. I have seen her performances in many excellent films.
B000083C49|5.0|Picking up where Star Trek III ended, our familiar space heroes are forced to use a Klingon Rust-bucket to once again fool Father Time. A space probe that looks like an upside down mechanical whale - from where-abouts unknown - threatens to annihilate Earth, and maybe Starfleet itself, unless the Earthen creature \\"Hump-back Whale\\" can adequately respond to the probe's emissions. Thus, go back in time to the late 20th c., return with a Hump-back whale in hopes of satisfying the probe, and order will be preserved. Captian Spock remains a bit under the weather, having died in Star Trek II, only to be resurected in Star Trek III, and seems rather confused by all the goings on. On Earth, the Enterprise officers, split into teams, each with a different task. When the tasks are completed, the crew returns to thier home century having once again saved the world. THOUGHTS: no one has ever belived the Premise of the Star Trek franchise has anything to do with science, or even science fiction. Star Trek is phantasmogorical at best. Spock results from his Vulcan father, and Earthen mother, marrying each other and biologically producing Spock. This is as likely as a horse succsessfully mating with a mermaid. Then again, Star Trek has never pretended to be what it's not. Very pretty actress Catherine Hicks plays a 20th c. Marine biologist, and that character provides the solvent to keep the plot together. In the first Star Trek film, one of the lead characters is \\"Decker\\". Both of these actors show up later in 7th Heaven. In ST-IV, Scotty tells Kirk that the Klingon food reproducer is giving him a belly-ache. Kirk responds by whispering to no one, \\"Oh so that's what it is\\". This clearly is a slam at James Doohan who, along with Nichele Nichols, have claimed that Shatner had been selfish, dictatorial, and treated the lesser stars like they were nothing more than props. None-the-less, Voyage Home is cute funny, and tense.
B000000XB9|3.0|I first heard the band CCR play their music in late 1970 on the old LP records. I was especially moved by one song. That song was & still is, WHO'LL STOP THE RAIN. Although all of the songs on this CD are very good & easy to listen to.  <br />People back in the 60's & 70's thought CCR made a lot of noice when they were playing. They now can experience some really awful music performed more for their stage presence than for their musical ability.
B00009W0WM|5.0|This review is for the two-disc 2003 Special Edition DVD by Warner Brothers.    I've probably seen this movie six times in the last 25 years and it still never grows old.  This Special Edition DVD is heaven sent with all the extra features plus the outstanding image quality.    The story is about an American named Rick (played by Humphrey Bogart) who owns a popular cafe/casino in Casablanca during World War II.  The significance of Casablanca, which is in Northern Africa, is that it is a popular place to come to for refugees who are fleeing from the Nazi occupied European countries and will hopefully find political asylum in America.  Crooked law enforcement officers have corrupted the town and now the Nazis have now just started arriving in Casablanca.  The central plot deals with a beautiful wife named Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor Lazlow, who are both trying to leave Casablanca but need exit visas, which are nearly impossible to obtain.  Since the Nazis want Lazlow, he needs to leave Casablanca or possibly face prison or even death.  Most of the movie takes place in Rick's Cafe with many memorable lines and scenes.  The thing that sets this movie apart from all others is the tremendous ending.  It's truly the consummate love story and exemplifies what true love is.    As for the DVD, the picture quality is perfect, if not stunning.  There is not a single sign of film deterioration or graininess during the entire movie except for some war newsreel scenes, which I assume they chose not to restore for the sake of authenticity.  (My personal feeling is that I wish they did restore the war footage). The contrast of the picture quality is outstanding and the black and white tones are tremendous.  The Special Edition version is well worth the extra money compared to the previously released versions.      Movie: A+++    DVD Quality: A
B00005JNSK|1.0|As a huge fan of Tim Burton films (Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice, Batman)I had high expectations for Charlie & the Chocolate Factory. But Burton/Depp/Elfman just fail to deliver on this one.  <br /> <br />The first thing that caught my attention was the very blatant over-use of computer generated special effects. Lots of Burton's earlier films (Beetlejuice, for example) boast \\"old school\\" special effects, which I think are awesome.In the opening scene in the factory I couldn't help but think \\"My god, this is so computerized it's pathetic.\\" And it didn't stop there...the whole movie was pervaded with CG CRAP.  <br /> <br />The movie adds NOTHING to the original 1971 Gene Wilder classic. \\"Charlie\\" only serves to destroy the mystery surrounding Willie Wonka's character in the original--there are just some things that should be left to the immagination. Tim Burton had the perfect chance to increase the aura of mystery and enigma of Willie Wonka, but he fails to do it. Instead, Depp comes off as a sort of extremely messed up Michael Jackson case. I mean, really? What's up with all the wierd flashbacks? Psycho! <br /> <br />But the worst part is: The Oompa Loompa(s). The computer generated oompa loompas are played by the same little guy that played Devito's attorney in \\"Big Fish\\". Well, it's just horrible, they all have the exact same facial features, and you can only understand a few words in the horrendous songs. I started to dread the demise of each child because I knew I was going to have to endure another one of those incomprehensible songs! <br /> <br />On a positive note: The parents and grandparents are great, the squirrel scene was awesome, the shack was cool. That's about it. <br /> <br />Overall I think this movie was just a project to make some quick money. Everyone is starting to catch on to the idea that to make a load of money in Hollywood quick, you have to appeal to kids. Especially those who haven't seen the original! <br /> <br />I agree with anotherreviewer: The best part of this movie is the preview for \\"The Corpse Bride\\". Everything is downhill from there!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is by far the most hilarious movie ever made. At work, we all keep saying quotes from the movie and talking like Napoleon. However, my boyfriend hates this movie. Therefore, based on others' opinions, I have come to the conclusion that it is not for everyone, although for most. Get this and laugh!!
B0000JCFPE|4.0|Spicey...well, just balls (pun intended) <br />yeah, this movie is good...yeah, half is \\"porn\\" <br />Watch it [the unrated version]...and read Douglas king's review...[oh, and btw- in one way, you can say it is \\"mysogynistic\\" in another, it exposes it, and in another it is \\"misandrist\\" as well as \\"gender-bending\\" which i reallly like (*Catherine Trammell) <br />
B000929AJQ|4.0|I recieved \\"With Teeth\\" in a two week time from purchase. It was brand new and was another birthday gift for my wife. Sadly they personalized message added to it did not arrive. Other than that I highly recommend this album for the ladies.
B0002V7OI8|1.0|This movie was terrible. It built up all this emotional stuff just to get your tear ducts going. I thought it was soooo cheesy. I felt exploited. At least with Armageddon, I knew it was a Bruckheimer with all the macho stuff and the great explosions. This movie started out to be serious and then melted into runny cheese.
B000050XEI|5.0|I just love this CD. I purchased it with a gift certificate for my birthday just before my son was born. It was one of two CDs that I took to the hospital to listen to during labor and recovery. It was so soothing and calming. It was just perfect. I received a lot of compliments on my taste in music from the hospital staff, too! Now, 18 months later, we still listen to it very often. It's perfect for company or dining music as it's pleasant but not so obtrusive that it interferes with conversation. We all love it! I think this is Enya's best album to date.
0316776963|5.0|I read this back-to-back last fall with Sedaris' then new book, DRESS YOUR FAMILY IN CORDUROY AND DENIM, mostly because I didn't want the first one to end as quickly as it did.<br /><br />They're both wonderful books, full of the same universally-appealing quirkiness, biting humor, and gym-regular prose. It's really hard to know where one ends and the other begins. I've yet to read a third David Sedaris, but when get to it, I now know enough to go ahead and buy number four at the same time, because I'll likely finish my third one after the local Borders has closed, but have a strong desire to keep reading.
B0000026WD|5.0|This cd or album is one of my favorite of Michael's 'cause ever song has a different mode to 'em.Bad shows that just because he might talk a lil' soft don't mean he is goin' to cramp.Also he shows his \\" mo' sex appeal \\" and he is BAD!.I like Thriller 'cause it makes u wanna dance and he changes to a great sing'r and an idol or African - American Idol. I like Dangerous 'cause he goes and show set different songs fo' different modes.Like 'Remember The Time' lovin', happy, 'Jam' to dance, let loss, everythin', 'Black or White' a song that tell it don't what color of the skin u r he will love u.My favorite song on there is ' Who Is It?' 'cause of the bet of the song, rythm, and the word come out u like BAM!. I think it is good 'cause people might say it is white and everythin' but it is 1000% B.E.T , black OK!
B0002Y4T92|1.0|A very dissapointing lack lustre performance from Mr Clapton, who decided to dress like a beach bum, and plays equally badly. Ommissions like Jeff Beck, from the concert are not acceptable. Larry Carlton did a good job but one short song, is far too short. Buddy Guy and Hubert Sumlin showed what real blues players can do (take note Eric you have so much to learn). The inclusion of obscure unknown artists, inplace of major players is a waste of time and money. <br />I suggest saving your money on this DVD, and getting something else. Eric and his new multicoloured strat guitar are sounding tired and boring. He is poor to average in his playing ability, and is now living on a former reputation, he can not replicate these days.
B000000WF9|5.0|To be honest, I didn't get this movie the first few times I saw pieces of it on television (I never had a chance to see it in the theaters). But once I saw the complete movie, my feelings about it changed. It's a movie about hope, about never giving up, about not saving anything for the way back... Michael Nyman's score gives depth and poignancy to the story and characters, and a resonance. During the viewing in which I was finally reached by this story, I started hearing the music for the first time. It's incredibly moving and strong.  I had to order the album online, as the record stores don't seem to carry it anymore. I'm so glad I did. The music is affecting, sorrowful, uplifting... perfect. And I'm glad the soundtrack only includes Michael Nyman's music-- it's the emotional core of the movie, and what I hungered to feel inside. A masterpiece of human feeling.
B000002H33|5.0|I know what people say about metallica now but if they listen to this album they will change thier minds. this album surely is one of the best albums ever made and their best album next to ride the lightning. <br /> all the songs are great and lyrics are special battery is very good opening and then master of puppets that i can't tell how great is this song one of the best songs off all times great solos drums lyrics and bass another special song is sanitarium that is damn hot and is one of the best lyrics of james the instrumental song of the album is orion uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuffffffff it's great and all the other songs are great and different. <br />james shows in this album that he is unique in heavy metal <br />kirk is very good and plays the best solo <br />this is the best drums  i have ever heard by lars that showes he is one of the best drummers of history <br />and... cliff i don't know what to say about this man all i can say is that he is surely the greatest bassist of all times  <br />rest in peace man!! <br />i think this is the best metall album of the history great great!!!!!!!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Out of all of the concerts I've ever seen live or on TV I would have to say this was my all-time favorite. This is no surprise, taking into consideration that the Eagles are not only one of the BEST musical groups ever, but they are also one of the top-selling groups. In one word: Amazing.
0743454537|5.0|This is an amazing story. It stirred up a lot of emotion and debate within myself, as I have no idea how I'd react in a similar situation. I couldn't put it down and finished it in two days. I loved how the story was told from different points of view. We were allowed to get to know each of the characters on a deeper level. I'd recommend it to anyone.
0451197968|5.0|Excellent book! When I picked up this book, I couldn't place it down until I was at the last page.
B000A59PMO|1.0|This show is slow, ignorant, and doesn't deserve to stay on the air. I urge people to stay away from this show and watch good quality shows such as The O.C., One Tree Hill, Law and Order, or some other show that is worth watching. The only words that describe this show is TOTAL CRAP.
B00005JNSK|3.0|I went to see this version this past weekend and needless to say i love the original the best,because it kept up with the book!!!!! I was surprised to see that this one was dark and Tim Burton made Johnny Depp look creepy and evil looking willy wonka and i didn't like that too much!!!!! I love the story,but i wanted this to be a movie for all ages instead of it being for us adults!!!!!! If i was you i would rent the original and then go see this version and you decide which one you like the best!!!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|<br />This is a CD that wakes up your love or real music and gives you a rush to sing, dance and simply feel good.  \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\", a lovely samba duet with Nelly Furtado has become my favorite song on my now favorite CD.  Michael Bubl is an absolute find and while he is easily compared to Harry Connick and Frank Sinatra, there is an intangible energy  and life to his music that makes everything feel resounding fresh and  sound incredibly good.   <br />
B0009HLDFU|4.0|Disc 1 (the hard rock side) - \\"In Your Honor\\" employs a faded three chord change progression under Grohl's passionate vocal delivery. The track kicks up the distortion and fury during its final minutes. \\"No Way Back\\" is stacked with hard-charging rhythms and Dave's angry, yet tuneful vocals. A repetitive riff and catchy chorus helps drive \\"DOA\\". \\"The Last Song\\" has leading drum beats and fuzzy guitars to help drive its tale of frustration about a relationship gone south. Grohl really gives it his all by challenging his vocal range. \\"End Over End\\" mixes clean riffs with heavy riffs as it builds to a powerful chorus, that's emphasized even more by pounding drums.<br /><br />Disc 2 (the mellow, singer-songwriter side) - \\"What If I Do\\" starts off at a good pace, but builds emotionally as it reaches its peak. \\"Miracle\\" is another acoustic tear-jerker that's accented by pleasant violin work. \\"On the Mend\\" has more guitar layers and texture than the other songs on the disc. Nora Jones makes an appearance on piano and vocals on the duet \\"Virginia Moon\\". It's a touching ballad of love that's more along the lines of her work rather than the Foo's. \\"Cold Day in the Sun\\" has guest vocals by Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme. Grohl finds himself in familiar territory behind the drum kit on this up-temp track.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Nothing notable<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Disc one isn't exactly the hardest rocking disc (as advertised), but it is certainly a solid rock disc. Disc two displays a softer, more emotional side of the group that just as enjoyable. As a whole, In Your Honor nails down the Foo Fighter's maturity as musicians and songwriters.
6305508550|4.0|This is a very funny movie, we make reference to it a lot at work like \\"What would you do with a million bucks?\\"  The movie is just very funny -- it fades at the end a bit, but it is still good stupid fun.  Also,if you have ever had to suffer really stupid jerk managers at work you will more than likely find the movie very funny.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I wanted to start off by telling you that these DVDs run over ten hours, so you better have some spare time on your hand. You won't be disappointed. What can really be said about the performances? They used the best of the best for this collection. Although there were feedback issues for some artists (Judas Priest, Duran Duran), it doesn't damper the over all presentation.<br /><br />All of the superstars of music (from 1985) are here, plus a lot of others we have never heard from again. On all of the discs you get the option of searching by artist, so you can go right to your favorite. Anther cool option is that you can pick to watch just the Wembley Stadium performances or just the JFK Stadium performances (with the exception of disc four).<br /><br />Disc 1 does an excellent job of setting the stage (no pun intended) for the huge event. Be sure to watch the `prequel' feature. It includes all the events that led up to the Live Aid concert. Various news clips are shown that describes what exactly was happening in Africa. The footage is followed by Band Aid's video for \\"Do They Know It's Christmas\\" which was created to raise money for Africa. Next up is the Untied States contribution to the cause, the video for \\"We Are The World\\" by USA for Africa.<br /><br />After this, it's on to the big event that kicks off in England with Prince Charles and Princess Diana in attendance. The disc is headlined by U2 performing \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"Bad\\". You also get performances by Bryan Adams, Elvis Costello, Sting, Phil Collins, Howard Jones, Paul Young, The Boomtown Rats, and many others. Phil Collins also begins his journey from England to Philadelphia to be the only artist to play both continents.<br /><br />Disc 2 is all about Queen. They steal the show with their high-energy, emotionally-charged performances of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Radio Gaga\\", \\"Hammer to Fall\\", \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\", \\"We Will Rock You\\", and \\"We Are the Champions\\". Another British favorite, David Bowie, woos the crowd with four songs of his own. Sting returns to collaborate with Dire Straits on \\"Money For Nothing\\".<br /><br />That's not the only collaboration though; the disc's headliner Elton John brings out Kiki Dee for \\"Don't Go Breaking My Heart\\" and George Michael for \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me Now\\". There are also performances by Simple Minds, the Pretenders, The Who, Kenny Loggins, and more. I was surprised to see that Jack Nicholson was the host of the Philadelphia show.<br /><br />Disc 3 has Phil Collins arriving in the U.S. for a rousing performance of \\"In The Air Tonight\\". Phil shows us that musicians make mistakes too when he hits a bad note and reacts to it. This disc is headlined by Patti Labelle, but has much bigger artist on it as well. Madonna chimes in with a few hits, and so does Eric Clapton. Freddy Mercury and Brian May return for \\"Is This the World We Created?\\"<br /><br />The Wembley show signs off with all of the artists that played that day getting together for a choppy version of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\" The metal-heads are represented by Judas Priest and Black Sabbath featuring Ozzy Osbourne. Performances by Neil Young, The Cars, Paul McCartney, Tom Petty, REO Speedwagon, and Crosby, Stills, and Nash are also highlighted.<br /><br />Disc 4 raps up the performances in the U.S. with soulful performances by Hall & Oates. The group brings out some rhythm and blues legends to help bolster their set. Mick Jagger takes the stage for two solo songs and a duet with Tina Turner. The other members of the Rolling Stones team up with Bob Dylan on \\"Blowing in the Wind\\". The Philly show end with another choppy finale of \\"We Are the World\\". It's kind of funny watching people fight for time on the three microphones.<br /><br />This disc also houses the bonus features. You get two performances of INXS from Australia which was hosting OS for Africa. A broadcast of B.B. King from a Jazz Festival is included as well. Various overseas artists gather for a charity relief song about Africa, which is thoughtful, but when translated seems a little mean. Run DMC and Ashford & Simpson's performances are here too. The oddest inclusion by far is the video for \\"Dancing in the Streets\\" by Mick Jagger and David Bowie. Why?<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />There's six hours of footage that wasn't included.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />An unbelievable, ground-breaking event for a good cause. Even the sales of the DVD go toward the effort in Africa. An event that will never be duplicated.as well.

B0000DBJ2B|3.0|I first saw this film in theaters and I didn't know what to expect from Henson. I was In awe at first of the sets and the epic feel it had at the begining, but It never delivered.<br /><br />The mystics are beatifully designed and a delight to watch, the skeksis on the other hand are a mess and seem more like cluttered lumps of cloth and hair.It's to much!<br /><br />Henson at the time was trying to brake out of the kiddie films he had done with the Muppets and I suppose when Yoda became a popular \\"seriouse\\" character in the Star Wars films (which Yoda was voiced and operated by non other than Frank Oz-the very director for this film!) I suppose Henson saw this as his effort toward the adults.<br /><br />But it didn't work, a majority of the reviews found here support this film as a kiddie film and it was never intended to be that. Even the fans of this film missed the point!<br /><br />I realy wanted to like this film way back when I first saw it in theaters, and I wanted to like it after I purchased the collectors edition-but I can't say I enjoy watching this film. The story just isn't a good one. There is no pacing at all and It doesn't pull me in by having me believe what is happening on film, everything looks and feels fake.<br /><br />Comparing this film to The Lord of The Rings films is also grossly unfair so I will not even go there as other reviewers have.<br /><br />I respect Hensons effort, I like what he was TRYING to do, but in the end this film is just OK.It's not good, It's not bad, It's OK.<br /><br />*The so called \\"rape\\" scene BTW is not a rape scene at all as one reviewer commented but a Skesis being stripped of his robes, It was meant to be a punishment for losing a challenge and this scene WAS in the Theatrical release of the film.If you don't understand whats happening don't make unfair comments.<br /><br />If you want Hensons version of fantasy check out Labrynth, he was in much better form!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Disc one packs a punch with its twenty songs. You get a nice mix of Eagles hits; \\"The Long Run\\", \\"I can't Tell You Why\\", \\"Lyin' Eyes\\", \\"Tequila Sunrise\\", \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive\\", and Take It To the Limit, and a few solo hits; \\"The Boys of Summer\\", \\"You Belong to the City\\", and \\"Sunset Grill\\". If that's not enough for you, the Eagle's if shell out a few new tunes. Joe Walsh contributes a song he wrote about being sober called \\"One Day at a Time\\", and Glen Frey & Don Henley chime in with a song they wrote the night after September 11th called \\"Hole in the World\\". An interesting note about this song is that the group was sent to enter the studio on that day.<br /><br />Disc two is a ten song set that serves as a best of the best as the concert nears its conclusion. You're still getting the solo songs; \\"Life's Been Good\\", \\"Dirty Laundry\\", \\"Mountain Way\\", and \\"All She Wants to Do is Dance\\", and now you're getting the mega-hits; \\"Heartache Tonight\\", \\"Life in the Fast Lane\\", Hotel California\\", \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Desperado\\". The second disc also contains the only bonus feature which is an interview with the group. There's not much to it, but the Eagles talk about their sound, each other, and what's changed. Be sure to find out what the `circle of fear' is.<br /><br />Now that I've talked about the content, let's talk about the show. If I had to sum it up into one word, it would be sensational. Every member's performance is damn near perfect. I mean, even the solos are note for note. There's no denying their talent and musicianship with this performance. Frey sound wonderful vocally and nails down all of his piano and guitar parts with ease. Don Henley is the consummate frontman who also shows that time has not conquered his voice or drumming skills.<br /><br />Bassist Timothy Schmit's falsetto is still as pleasant and soothing, and Joe Walsh (still wacky) displays his knack for the fretboard without breaking a sweat. The group's five part harmonies are the heart and soul of the music, and despite different music styles and voices, manage to make it sound exceptional. The stage is rather large with a decent amount of back-up player in the shadows. The brass and string section really add texture to the music. The Eagles really know how to work the crowd by bringing the energy up for the up-tempo numbers, and bringing it back down for the ballads.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />It's sad that I know a few of the Eagles songs from television commercials that they've appeared in.<br /><br />The Verdict<br /><br />Whether you buy a ticket to their live performance (cha-ching) or buy this DVD, rest assured that you won't regret spending your hard-earned money.

B00005Q4CS|3.0|Well, this is going to sound clich&eacute;, but this movie just didn't have enough substance. Well, the right kind of substance for me anyway. I wasn't necessarily bored by it like I am by a lot of other so called great movies, this was actually pretty fun to watch as it was visually captivating, but unfortunately in the end ended up being a pretty average story.<br /><br />There wasn't enough for me to care about, it's \\"just\\" a story about the consequences of doing drugs, there weren't really any interesting subplots or anything that was explored. With a premise like that, I would've preferred seeing how destructive drugs could be to friendships, relationships, etc.<br /><br />I can just add this to my list of over-hyped movies I've seen that was supposed to be amazing, but only succeeded in mildly entertaining me. Unfortunately, this list is growing at an alarming rate.
B00005R1N3|5.0|When I first saw this flick, I was home alone, it was all dark and snowing outside.  It freaked me out.  The final twenty minutes or so made me quite uneasy and I found myself shouting at the screen, telling the girl not to go upstairs, and this is something I never do.   <br /> <br />Black Christmas is one of those rare slashers that puts the accent on tension and athmosphere.  There's no real blood to speak of here, rather through mood and lighting the film reaches near unbearable tension.   <br /> <br />It's great to see some classic elements from the horror genre presented here for the first time.  The obscene phone calls coming from upstairs (later utilized to brilliant effect in When a Stranger Calls) and it looks like Halloween may have had some inspiration from this little gem. Bob Clark's direction is nothing but superb, he had the feel for the genre, most definately.  God only know why he opted to leave it completely.  Performances are good; Hussey, despite being a total eye candy, is very convincing as the damsel in distress, Keir Dullea very creepy as her boyfriend, Kidder deliciously nasty and Saxon reliable as always. <br /> <br />A horror classic in every sense.

B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen (1978.) Van Halen's first album.<br /><br />Just before recording this album, brothers Eddie & Alex Van Halen formed a band with two friends by the names of David Lee Roth & Michael Anthony named Mammoth. Just when they recording, they decided to change the name to the more honest name for the brothers of this new band, Van Halen. They were ready to make an impact on the Rock Music world, and would also become one of the bands that destroyed Disco in the late '70s. And this, their debut, is concidered their best by many fans. Does it live to the hype, or is it just an Overrated Debut? Read on for my review.<br /><br />First things first, this record IS overrated, but it DOES live up to the hype. Isn't that just great? Lolz. Anyway, out of all the songs on here, SIX of them were huge hits! First off is the classic \\"Driving Rocker\\" Runnin' With the Devil, which has become an ultimate VH classic over the years. Next up is the song that revolutionized Guitar Finger Tapping by EVH himself, Eruption. Then, there's the awesome cover of a Kinks' classic, You Really Got Me, which VH even made more popular themselves! Now, there's another classic rocker by the name of Ain't Talkin' Bout Love, which is my personal favorite Van Halen Song. Then, there's yet ANOTHER classic rocker about a One-Night Stand, Jamie's Cryin'. Last, there's a catchy classic little blues-rocker by the name of Ice Cream Man, which is another favorite of mine, as well as a cover. Now, I'm gonna get onto the Song Review part. Read on for my opinions, folks.<br /><br />Runnin' With the Devil- What HASN'T been said about this one? THE Perfect Opener to a great album. Starts off with a pretty creepy intro, then explodes into a classic Eddie Van Halen guitar riff. David Roth sings his ass off like a banshee's falssetto in the middle of the song!<br /><br />Eruption- What Hasn't Been Said About This One, either? Easily one of the best, if not THE best Guitar Instrumentals of all time. Eddie just taps perfectly. Though a bit overrated, it's still a perfect song.<br /><br />You Really Got Me- Like a said, a Kinks cover, but made even better! To this day, this version of a classic STILL gets played 24/7 on Classic Rock and other Rock Radio. If you don't like this one, skrew yaou!<br /><br />Ain't Talkin' Bout Love- My favorite Van Halen song, as of now. Eddie's opening riff is yet ANOTHER great one, and Alex's drum beat goes PERFECTLY with the entire song. DLR also sings some humorous lines.<br /><br />I'm The One- A swingy type of song, which also tends to be somewhat overrated by some people, that doesn't mean it isn't Awesome, though! It just goes totally crazy during the chorus! Mr. EVH does some more fast pickin in this one as well.<br /><br />Jamie's Cryin'- You've all heard this one as well. Though not quite as popular is it's preceeders, it STILL gets plenty of airplay today nontheless. \\"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Jamie's cryin'...\\" The drum intro is also sampled by Tone-Loc in his hit Wild Thing, and made this song even more popular by using it!<br /><br />Atomic Punk- Eh, not too crazy about this one, it still is a good song, but pales in comparison with the rest of the disc.<br /><br />Feel Your Love Tonight- A minor hit from this album, this song was one of the preludes to forge the Hair Metal sound that would dominate most of the '80's, yet it's not a Hair Band song at all. A bit on the poppy side though, but one of the catchiest tracks Van Halen has ever done.<br /><br />Little Dreamer- An underrated song, this one's got a great melodic-speed drum beat, as well more catchy DLR styled vocals.<br /><br />Ice Cream Man- Didn't like this one much at first, but it grew on me fast and became another one of my favorites. Starts off with an acoustic bluesy riff along with some bluesy vocals from DLR himself, then turns into an awesome Rockabilly-sounding catchy rocker with another awesome solo.<br /><br />On Fire- Grew kinda tired of this one easily, but it's still acatchy number with a Red Hot chorus. Nice way to end the show.<br /><br />Well, there you have it. Van Halen is easily one of the greatest Rock & Roll bands of all time, and their debut is easily their best. If you're looking for a flawless hard rock masterpiece, don't look any farther. These guys would mature and grow their sound eventually, as well as finding some commercial success, but THIS is them at their prime, right where they started.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECCOMENDED TO FANS OF HARD ROCK, CLASSIC ROCK, HEAVY METAL, LED ZEPPELIN AND SOME GREAT ROCK AND ROLL GUITAR PLAYING! THIS DEBUT IS STILL VAN HALEN'S BEST AFTER ALL THESE YEARS!<br /><br />Also reccomended:<br /><br />Led Zeppelin- In Through the Out Door<br /><br />AC/DC- Highway to Hell<br /><br />Aerosmith- Rocks<br /><br />Guns N' Roses- Appetite for Destruction<br /><br />Ta-ta!one easily, but it's still a catchy number with a Red Hot chorus. Nice way to end the show. <br /> <br />Well, there you have it. Van Halen is easily one of the greatest Rock & Roll bands of all time, and their debut is easily their best.

0966638328|5.0|I bought this book yesterday, and I can't put it down! As a designer, I tend to lean toward the same colors or hue. This book has MANY color combinations to choose from and it has a great amount of information about color and they way people subconsciously see color.... <br />I disagree with the review about it just having ads and not really a book to read the whole way through... it's really a little of both! <br />Filled with a lot of useful information, colored ads/packages/examples to back it up, and the actual pantone colors for you to use! <br />Great Buy!

B0006A9FMI|4.0|Unfortunately, I rented one of those \\"captioned\\" subtitled DVDs, so the presentation - while not ruined - was subducted.  But I guess Dreamworks is working on fixing the problem.    This one should've been rated \\"R\\" for violence, but was lacking any real foul language.  I'm amazed this got by with \\"PG-13\\", to be honest.    Any of you seen \\"X\\" The Feature Film?  Same chronic illness plaguing that film also plagues this film: lush, mind-blowing visuals and high entertainment value... centered around the exact same plot you've found recycled in numerous \\"anime\\", including \\"X\\".  Batou and Togusa are detectives in the far \\"Blade Runner\\" future tracking gruesome murders, a couple of those involve seemingly suicidal cyborgs, could have a connection to an important ghost residing in The Net, they go after it...  That's it for plot, folks.      As for droning philosophy about man's curious want - ney, NEED - to recreate himself... this film has that in spades.  Maybe a little too much.  \\"GITS2\\" could've easily been trimmed 15 minutes, and lost none of the impact.    It never aspires beyond that.  Good thing it doesn't matter, since Mamoru Oshii wrote this film to basically feast the visuals.  And, oh, what visuals there are.  CGI&2D layering, 3D computer models, all the trick sh-t.  Dimensions are continuously flexed amidst a broad earth-tone-based color scheme.  There's a parade as a set-piece in here that renders you... for lack of a better term - hypnotized.    Action sequences are definitely manga-savvy, skewing camera angles right against the ceiling, zooming lightning fast into a cyborg's facial protuberance.  These folks are getting REALLY GOOD with digital and 3D matte lighting.  A couple shots to an untrained eye could pass as real.    One last thing: the sound is designed by \\"The Incredibles\\" Oscar-winner Randy Thom.  His crew at Skywalker Sound, in conjunction with the boys from Nippon, fabricate every single auditory impulse with machine-like precision.  Listen,the film has BEAUTIFUL sound in it, but you most likely won't realize it readily, because it blends into \\"GITS2\\" so seamlessly.  Lotsa gunshots.    All garnish, unfortunately no porterhouse.  Since the garnish is of such quality, I don't grade down.  It's fun... just grab your Thai Stick.    p.s. Watch out for the funny angle when Batou pulls on his basset hound's upper lip, stretching it to the camera.
B00005UKE0|5.0|There is a certain feeling you gain while listening to this CD.  It is magical, it is unexpected, it is spiritual.  George plays the guitar and sings with great confidence and professionalism.  The edition is also fun to look at and to read George's introduction.  I love this CD!  Buy it!

B00008977N|5.0|I am a live music fan and have been to several concerts in my years. One problem with video performances is that you lose some of the concert feel and stage effects. There are few concert videos that I will purchase - this is one of the exceptions. This performance is absolutely amazing! From the stage and lighting effects to the amazing vocal performances this concert was excellent! If you are a Peter Gabriel fan in any form this concert is a must have for your collection. You know the songs, you know the videos, I recommend you get to know this concert.
B0009I7O7U|5.0|It's official...John Legend is PHENOMENAL! He has got to be one of the best artists in modern times! He can sing, he can write, he can play instruments; I mean, is there anything he can't do?! I strongly advise anyone who lives in a city where he is touring that you definitely go see him perform.  But first, buy the cd.  He is remarkable! I can't wait for his next album.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|Calling this movie a \\"comic book\\" movie is almost a lie.  This movie relates to the Hellblazer comics about as much as \\"Batman and Robin\\" related to the Batman comics.  If you don't believe me, John Constantine is supposed to be a Brit with blonde hair.  Does that description match a very American, brown haired Keanu Reeves living in Los Angeles?  No. <br /> <br />Once you get past the fact that this movie is NOT a big-screen adaptation of the Hellblazer comics, I thought it was a fairly enjoyable movie.  It's basically the Matrix only in modern-day L.A. and Hell.  Keanu does a perfectly Keanu-rific job of moping his way through a movie being angry that he is going to die and go to hell because of the sins of his early life.  The difference between Keanu's John Constantine and the rest of the world is that HE KNOWS there is a Heaven and a Hell and he knows where he's going when his time is up (which is quickly approaching).   <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie and thought it was worth buying for anyone who is a fan of Keanu Reeves or Heaven/Hell mythology.  It was better than earlier \\"comic\\" movies that dealt with this dark subjects (ie: Spawn) but not as good as more recent \\"dark\\" comic flicks such as \\"Batman Begins\\" and/or \\"Sin City.\\"  If you want to watch an effects driven film, this could be for you, but if you want pure Hellblazer in movie form, don't keep your hopes up, this movie will let you down.
B0000509C4|3.0|Although CREEPSHOW 2 has the Stephen King/George Romero connection, it doesn't quite have the flair and fun of its predecessor, nor as talented a cast.  King's stories are adapted by Romero, but Romero didn't direct, so these three tales don't have the finesse one would have expected.<br /><br />The first one revolves around a bunch of nasty youths who rob a kindly storekeeper and his wife, and then kill them.  The storefront wooden indian takes revenge, but it's all pretty lame and George Kennedy and Dorothy Lamour are virtually wasted.<br /><br />The second story, \\"The Raft\\" has some moments of suspense and tension, but the cast are virtual unknowns and can't carry it as well as more seasoned actors.<br /><br />The final segment features Lois Chiles as a lawyer's wife who on the way home from a dalliance with a male prostitute hits and kills a hitchhiker and tries to get away before she's caught.  Of course, the hitchhiker keeps popping up, and she keeps killing him, and you know where it will all end.<br /><br />Although mildly entertaining, CREEPSHOW 2 pales in comparison to its progenitor and one wonders how it would have turned out if Romero had directed and a more potent cast in place.
B0002I831S|5.0|Any fan of the original Trek series will love this compilation.  The video is of highest quality, and having the beloved series on DVD is long overdue to diehard fans.  The packaging, while cumbersome to get into for your DVDs, is appropriate and elegant. The hard plastic case is very protective also.  I can't wait to get the 2nd and 3rd seasons! This product has renewed my love for the original Star Trek, its optimism and hopeful outlook for humanity.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|There are a number of MJ compilations out there, but this is by far the best one.  It features a nice sampling of Jackson 5 and 70s Jacksons hits, as well as all the major solo hits.  The only major omissions are the Jackson 5 hits \\"I'll Be There\\" and \\"Dancing Machine\\", the Jacksons \\"State of Shock\\" and the duet with Janet Jackson, \\"Scream\\", but considering this is a Michael Jackson compilation it's not that detrimental.   <br /> <br />I'm impressed at the scope of this collection, and all of MJ's major albums, \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad\\" are well-represented here.  The underrated \\"Dangerous\\" is also well-represnted including songs that were not on \\"HIStory\\" or \\"Number Ones\\", including the hypnotic \\"In the Closet\\" and \\"Who Is It\\".   <br /> <br />Invincible is only represented by \\"You Rock My World\\", although I think \\"Butterflies\\" and \\"Cry\\" would have been good additions.   <br /> <br />But, it's hard to complain when you have 30 years of some of the most incredible pop music ever made.

B0007Y4TVU|1.0|I must say, to have heard all the amazing reviews on the \\"creative genius\\" of this album I was excited about this. Remembering Toxicity from my middle school days, and realizing that it was one of the only nu-metal albums I ever enjoyed, I figured that Mezmerize would offer some good material at least. I certainly enjoyed the first two songs, but the rest of the album just went downhill. The \\"creativity\\" and \\"genius\\" just doesn't seem to be there. I think that the true downfall of the band came with Malakian's total takeover of the band. He wrote nearly all the music himself, and I don't condemn him for that, but the inclusion of the other guys would have improved the material substantially. I realized that the songs I favored most on the album were the ones in which Serj was involved in the writing. Malakian also does a ton of vocals, the majority of which just flat out suck. He needs to leave that to Serj. <br />There were only a couple of standouts to me, which were the first two tracks and \\"Question!\\" Even those seemed laking after a couple of listens. So do yourself a favor and don't waste your money on this piece of overrated crap from the Malakian Show.
B0000VD04M|4.0|Famed director Tim Burton directed Johnny Depp in their second collaration, the biographical Oscar winning triumph; \\"ED WOOD\\" <br />the story of a director's unforgettable passion for movies and his dreadful vision on directing movies and how his awful films have still been a inspiration. Martin Landau brilliantly and terrifyingly portrays the legendary Bela Lugosi, which got him the oscar for best supporting actor. Sarah Jessica Parker as Eddie's girlfriend Dolores Fuller. One of the most extrodonary biographical films among \\"Chaplin\\", \\"the Aviator\\" and \\"Cinderella Man\\" Johnny Depp's second best film after \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" Everyone is very good.

A Film of a young man whose has stood the test of time as the worst director of all time, but hes honored for his dreadful filmography with Tim Burton's triumph.
B000001Y42|1.0|Oh how I loathe this band... <br />Just when i thought popular music might start getting better... <br />No, really this is total bullsh*t. These bastards along with Korn, Slipknot, and all the other Nu-Metal clones have made it cool to take away the very fundamental elements of good true metal and replace them with rap and other garbage, just to market them to the streamlined, hip-hop happy MTV generation. There is precious little talent on this piece of \\"metal.\\" The musical growth of this band cannot even be charted, as it doesn't exist. Songs are formulaic, repetitive, and just simply boring. These guys should hang it up now. The fans, though, are just about as bad as the band, claiming these guys are \\"real metal.\\" You want REAL METAL? Emperor, Morbid Angel, Death, Cryptopsy, Symphony X, Megadeth, Pantera, Bathory, Venom, Dream Evil, Exhorder, Sadus, Necrophagist, Opeth, Iron Maiden, Gorguts, Edguy, Immortal, Meshuggah, etc. <br />Now don't buy this.
0446608955|2.0|I'm guilty, I love Nicholas Sparks' books, particularly The Notebook. I don't believe this book to be one of his best. <br /> <br />There isn't any real chemistry between the two and I began to feel that Landon was just some confused boy with a deadline to meet. The ending was endearing and leaves you with an unexpected glow but it was too little too late. <br /> <br />Maybe I'm just growing cynical but this was certainly no book to be remembered. For a fool-proof all around winner of a romance buy The Notebook!
B0006A9FKA|4.0|If you are a fan of The Newsroom, The Office or John Cleese's Clockwise, then you are the sort of person who should enjoy the dry British humor of this film gem. <br /> <br />Shaun is an uninspired stiff.  He likes his beer, his music, his friends, his girl and his pub.  This is not enough for his girl so she calls it quits.  But while this is going on we see small flashes that all is not right in the world.  The dead are starting to walk and civilization is falling.  Most of this is lost on Shaun and his obnoxious roommate until they find a zombie in their back yard.  After finally paying some attention to the news channels Shaun comes up with a plan. <br /> <br />Armed with a cricket bat Shaun is going to rescue his mother, his girl, and hole up in his pub.  Suddenly Shaun is motivated although his old self keeps showing through. <br /> <br />I won't tell you were his plan and battles lead as that is part of the fun of this movie.  But remember that this is a zombie flick so there is some gore (one scene in particular).  But unlike the Films of Romero and imitators the zombies are not central, Shaun is. <br /> <br />I found the cast to be strong and well chosen.  Acting was pretty solid and better than most horror, and probably all zombie, films.  The humor was good (if you like the dry style) and I particularly liked they way the coming menace was hinted at in the beginning.  A very good film.  Check it out.
B000002U82|5.0|The title came from the question-and-answer sessions that provided the selection of voices that are scattered throughout this experience. One of the questions involved the other side of the moon, \\"Dark Side\\" wasn't even the title yet, and the answer was, \\"There is no dark side of the moon, really; matter of fact, it's all dark.\\" Who would've known those would be such immortal words?<br /><br />This classic is about life, and all its pressures, and sounds REALLY good while telling of them. The beginning track, \\"Speak To Me,\\" starts with a lone heartbeat, all you have at the beginning of your life, and the sound effects are sort of an overture to the main body of work, clocks ticking, voices speaking, talking about insanity and whatnot, a creshendo, climaxing with a truly creepy scream; is it panic? Fear? Pain? I guess it could be anything. This segues into \\"Breathe,\\" an overview of life's pressures, toiling endlessly until death, \\"balanced on the biggest wave, you race toward an early grave.\\"<br /><br />\\"On The Run\\" is about paranoia, the term itself is British slang for such a state, the running footsteps, heavy panting breaths, the airport voice a reminder of always having to keep moving, and those swells that the synthesizer lets out, overbearing pressure to never stop, or they'll get you. The explosion toward the end is one of the most awesome things I've ever heard, worthy of a subtitle itself. And as the rumbling dies down, more footsteps and panting, the paranoid never rests, he is forever persued, often by his own imagination.<br /><br />\\"Time\\" is rather self-explanatory, the passing of time is an awful thing, if looked at in hindsight, there's always something that should've been done, and at the end of each day, the sun and the earth are still the same, but you are \\"shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.\\"<br />\\"Time\\" includes \\"Breathe Reprise,\\" a break, a chance to relax at home, and shut out the world, if only for a short while.<br /><br />\\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\" is a highlight, featuring the wordless, often imitated vocal of Claire Torry, the song about the Spectre of Death, and the almost universal fear of it. Listen closely, and you'll hear the aside, \\"I never said I was afraid of dying.\\" Although the original is always better, if you can find the video of \\"The Delicate Sound Of Thunder,\\" pay close attention to this song. The part that Margaret Taylor sings, will raise the hair on your neck.<br />This track was also called \\"The Mortality Suite.\\"<br /><br />\\"Money\\" is the biggest hit from this collection, but remember, \\"Dark Side\\" is about life and its pressures. Most marital problems stem from financial hardship, money problems will keep you awake at night. It's just about opulence and materialism.<br /><br />\\"Us And Them,\\" is Waters' indictment of political power, especially behind any act of war; the strongest line being, \\"'Forward!', he cried from the rear, and the front rank died.\\" It's like the pawns in a chess game, these men are expendable, they occupy the enemy while the \\"important\\" people play from the rear. Very deep.<br /><br />\\"Any Colour You Like\\" is just a loose jam, like they used to do when playing London's UFO Club. It's just do as you feel, ad lib, and as they said to denote it, \\"Any colour you like.\\" It's an ideal intermission between \\"Us And Them,\\" and the next selection.<br /><br />...which is \\"Brain Damage.\\" It was originally to be called \\"The Dark Side Of The Moon,\\" and I think they should've stuck with that. I guess they have their reasons. It's about an impending breakdown, the \\"lunatic\\" getting closer and closer, until \\"I see you on the dark side of the moon.\\" Not of this world, not of this life, \\"spaced out.\\"<br /><br />\\"Eclipse\\" is the epilogue, a finale, the summing up of life, all that's in this life, all that was, is, and will be. I must admit to not paying attention to how deep the last line is, until many moons later; \\"Everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun iseclipsed by the moon.\\" The sun is the source of light, energy, our livelihood. Ancient people thought it was God, because it is life-sustaining. Being in tune is just that, the harmony of everything working together, a finely-tuned machine, or more appropriately, a musical instrument. But the moon, here, is discord, the dark side is madness, stress, pressure, and insanity. During the eclipse, it's the dark side that faces us, all we can see and we are faced with all that makes us crazy, at least for a while. And the sun is eclipsed by the moon, regularly, fading into the lone heartbeat that began the piece, taking the listener back to his or her beginnings, with the reminder that \\"There's no dark side of the moon, really; Matter of fact, it's ALL dark.\\"Ancient people thought it was God, because it is life-sustaining.

1400032717|5.0|Although there's plenty of reviews of this book, I had to write about some of my highlights because I enjoyed the story so much. <br /> <br />I checked the author biography about 10 times while reading this book, wondering if he was autistic or if he specialized in the field of autism. He appears to be a neurotypical guy who teaches creative writing in England. <br /> <br />The mind-bender for me was I fully believed the story to be written by a 15-year old austic boy, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Haddon blends the plot, characters and point of view to perfection. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to grade-school teachers. I think they will enjoy it to the fullest extent, not because of the autistic POV, but to see how the boy thinks and learns (and trusts his teacher).
B00002E23E|4.0|I am a Huge Zeppelin fan. I like this film alot,  it has tons of good shots.  The newer Zeppelin film is definitely better.  It covers the early career of the band.

0694003611|5.0|I read to my daughter regularly, and without a doubt this is her favorite book.  She is  17 months old, and I think something about the rhythm of the language lulls here right to sleep.  This book is a classic, and I'm sure it will be a staple in my home for a long time.
1400032717|4.0|This book, less about the mystery behind a dead dog, but more about the inner workings of an autistic child is a rather charming story.  I had read a few reviews before reading this book and most of the reviews promised a funny novel, but I found it far more heartwrenching than humorous. <br /> <br />The complexities of this book, and the way that an autistic boy sees the world add up to make a good read.  This book read quickly, partly because of the brilliant simplicity of the writing, and partly because it is just an interesting story.  Well worth the read, but not as funny as some had promised.
B002NZV68U|2.0|First off, the movie is more of a drama than a comedy. I was hoping to be laughing at Johnny Depp's comments, but was dumbfounded.<br /><br />The movie begins with Wonka closing the factory and years later reopening the factory to the public. Unfortunately, only 5 lucky children will be allowed to enter. We have kids from different parts of the world winning including Charlie, who is lives in a run down cottage but has his family. The group is given a tour of the factory by the eccentric, but disturbed Wonka. Johnny Depp is a little too weird as oppose to Gene Wilder's sacastic, but lovable Wonka. This new Wonka is too strange and I don't think I'd feel comfortable with him giving me a tour. On the other hand, the factory itself is so imaginative and truly represents Burton's strange mind. The Oompa Loopa's is played by one person and the songs, clearly by Danny Elfman, sounds like he can't change his 80s new wave sound. In addition, it was hard to hear the lyrics, therefore the lesson to be learned was hard to understand.<br /><br />The relationship of family is explored throughout the movie from Charlie's relationship to his family and Wonka's relationship to his father. The movie seems to be Tim Burton's way of teaching children the dangers of overindulgence and love of family. Unfortunately, the movie, although imaginative, was not very entertaining. I was hoping for more, especially with the combo of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, but was left disappointed.
0375701427|4.0|I stopped reading Phillip Roth after Portnoy's Complaint, a decision which I must now revisit after reading American Pastoral.  This is a wonderful (if at times difficult) treatment of how a national \\"falling from grace\\" telegraphs through all our lives and  intersects with personal responsibility.   <br /> <br />Why only 4 stars?  It probably deserves 5, but at times Roth meanders more than I would have liked. <br /> <br />A well earned Pulitzer.

The characters are wonderfully rendered, painted in both broad and detailed strokes. It takes a few pages to adjust, as most spanish language novels that are translated into English do, but stick with and be rewarded with a feast for the senses.

B0001NBMBC|5.0|Ok, I hate to burst EVERYONES bubble, but most of you are actually wrong, Slipknot is a mixture of many genre's if you go by present and history genre's, Corey Taylor's vocals are great for their style, I dont think the lead singer of Murder Dolls who indeed sounds like a little girl when he/she/it yells, Corey Taylor's yelling is deep and I will go as far as saying \\"manly\\" I don't know about anybody else but I'm quite sure I would go on a date with him or another group member, back to my exact point. Slipknot has been called numerous things, anywhere from anti-christs to lousey people with lousey costumes. My personal opinion to everyone is, the music is great everything is set the way it needs to be set, but if most people can get their heads out of lala-land, maybe they can listen PASSED the music and straight to the Lyrics. yes the vocals are hard to understand in some songs, but I understand them perfectly. As far as genre's go, if you date into history the sound didnt make music, it was mostly the lyrics that had done all the work for everyones professional careers, I as you can tell I am an all round Maggot. A bit of Inf. if you are smart enough to understand what Inf. means it stands for Information ^-^, but the people who rag Slipknot, for their Information, EVERY Band EVERY Genre and EVERY Singer, has their ups in music and their downs.....now nothing is perfect, and if you are going to rag on Slipknot on a Slipknot review, then I would say you are the ones who are actually childish immature dingbats who dont know no better, if you dont like the music, then dont listen to it. not liking Slipknot.....then coming to a Slipknot board.....and complaining like little 3 year olds is like, getting caught cheating then telling your boyfriend/girlfriend that they were seeing things. My opinion, if you didnt like Slipknot then you wouldnt have listened or bought their album or albums.

B000006OBQ|5.0|Here you go...Sinatra at the Sands...every wished you could be there in Vegas?  I know I do, and this record is just about the closest you'll ever get to that dream.  Not only do we hear Sinatra performing at the peak in his career, but we also get a heavy dose of Count Basie and his orchestra backing him up.  The sound quality is crystal clear, and the historical significance of this recording is not measurable.  Sinatra and his friends OWNED and RAN Vegas in the 50's and 60's, and this album takes a peek into that world of glamour, fame, money, booze, cigarettes, and an infinite supply of beautiful women. <br /> <br />Probably the most noteworthy element is the commentary and monologue by Sinatra.  He jokes with the crowd, hits on women, and tells stories about growing up in Hoboken, NJ, as well as parties with Dean Martin.  Frank even ranks on Dean:  \\"Dean Martin has been stoned more times than a United States embassy; (applause and laughs); I don't know what you were applauding for...did you want to stone more embassies?  I don't know about this bunch!\\"  Sinatra is totally calm and cool and we can hear just how comfortable he feels as a performer in this specific setting.  We don't hear this with most modern acts as they tour from city to city.  Rarely, except for some moern jazz, do we hear something from an artist who regularly plays a specific venue.  I feel this adds a strength to the music. <br /> <br />As far as the songs go, we a great mix.  There are a few hits such as 'I've Got You Under My Skin,' 'My Kind Of Town,' 'Luck Be a Lady,' 'Fly Me To the Moon,' and 'It Was a Very Good Year.'  To newcomers, it is apparent that Sinatra doesn't necessarily sing the same song in the same manner during each performance.  He adds in new words, or begins phrases at odd times, but the personality he puts into the vocals make up for what would otherwise be out of place.  There are also some less popular songs here that are definitely worth checking out like 'Where orWhen' and 'The Shadow of Your Smile.' <br /> <br />In general, this recording serves two major purposes.  First of all, it's just about the best Live Sinatra you'll ever hear, and secondly, it is an important piece of history...almost like a scene in a comic book of a snapshot in time.  This album will bring you back to that place.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|I think people who diagnose a movie based on director, actor, and comparative story line need to get a life. ITS A MOVIE!!! It's not based on real characters or events, exaggeration of life is expected when seeing a movie. This movie is based on a comic book, A COMIC BOOK, not real, doesn't need to be real. The movie does not need to be compared to its previous counterpart, its a movie version so it will be different. To anyone reading the one star reviews, tell them to shut up, this is a good movie if you are open minded and enjoy relaxing in a place besides reality on any given evening. If your intelligent and enjoy entertainment, then see this movie, it is really good. Oh, don't worry about the actors, after all they are only acting, right?
B0001WTVUW|4.0|I was only ten years old when this aired on public television, but can say in all honesty that this movie scared the living hell out of me.  Not only did this movie leave a lasting impression, it was also the foundation for more than a few \\"disturbing dreams\\" that would follow for literally decades.  These weren't necessarily \\"nightmares\\" (which I never really have had; at least ones that I can remember) but dreams that provoked intense (and very vivid) perceptions of a nuclear conflict.  This has been a subject of fear since the 1950's, however I think people of my generation (growing up in the 1980's) had a different perception on it.  It seems in the decades prior to the 1980's, people (Americans) feared the Soviet Union society more than they feared their weapons.  This would especially be true during McCArthy's \\"Red Scare\\" 1950's.  For us (growing up the 1980's), it was the weapons and \\"system\\" that was to be feared.  To us, the notion of a nuclear conflict wasn't about two conflicting ideologies but rather a humanless and automated \\"system\\" intended to destroy civilizations.  The \\"system\\" was machine, automated, computer controlled.  America's nuclear infrastructure made up half of the \\"system\\", while the USSR's nuclear infrastructure made up the other half.  Both were disturbing.  Together they were frightening.  Perhaps, this is why the scene in \\"The Day After\\" where the outbound ICBM's are shown ascending into the sky is so memorable.  Thats one of the few scenes that I can remember from this movie.  With the launch of the missiles, you sense the \\"breakdown\\" of everything human.  Machine and computer have taken over and is intent on full destruction.  You are at the mercy of automation -- a slave to it even.  At that point, you know nothing is ever going to be same again.  You are horrified even thinking about what events might begin occuring in only half an hour.  The \\"other side\\", you are well aware, is responding in kind to those missile contrails you see streaking into your sky. <br /> <br />I just ordered this DVD for \\"nostalgic\\" sake.  I'm hoping it doesn't appear completetly \\"cheesy\\" though, as a lot of stuff does years later.   <br /> <br />By the way, it is *really* interesting to read the user reviews for this movie on here from folks who watched this movie in the (then) USSR.  One Russian reviewer even stated that he watched it in Moscow only a few days after it aired in the US.  I would not have known that it aired there had it not been for this review forum.  Even more interesting, is the fact that these reviewers stated that it generated parallel emotions with the general Soviet public as it did with us.  That can only be a good thing.  Actually, that can only be a wonderful thing.  I don't know how much a role this movie had (if any) in helping to formulate a US/Russian friendship, but I'm definetly all for combined US/Russian shared ventures (i.e., space exploration) that benefit all of humanity over maintaining a \\"Global Doomsday Machine\\". <br /> <br />

B00005JNTX|4.0|Movie - ***** <br />DVD - *** <br />Unfortunately, this movie will be the victim of a studio \\"double dip.\\"  This first release is just a bare bones DVD with no special features.  In various interviews, Robert Rodriguez has spoken of the upcoming Special Edition (most likely to be released for the holiday season).  As you know, the movie Sin City was created from three of Frank Miller's Sin City books, \\"The Hard Goodbye\\", \\"The Big Fat Kill\\", and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\".  Rodriguez shot these stories in their entirity and spliced them together for the theatrical version of the film.  In the upcoming Special Edition of the DVD, these three stories will be recut separatly and include footage that was cut for release.  The DVD will also include the theatrical version, and the next installment in Rodriguez's \\"10 Minute Film School\\" series.  My advice is to save your money and get the real Sin City DVD when it is released this Winter.
B000000OSE|5.0|Use your Illusion 1 is filled with some of Axl's greatest vocal songs and also some songs that rock harder than Appetite for Destruction. I would still most recommend AFD for the best GN'R.  <br /> <br />Right Next Door to Hell- 5/5 Great way to start an album, I especially like the beginning of the song. <br /> <br />Dust N' Bones- 5/5 Awesome- Cool lyrics especially, and also good piano in this piece. <br /> <br />Live and Let Die- 4/5 Good Song, but not originally from GN'R.  <br /> <br />Don't Cry- 4.5/5 Good song, a little slow, but Axl's voice is great in this song. <br /> <br />Perfect Crime- 4/5 Good song but Axl talks too fast. <br /> <br />You Ain't the First- 5/5 This is not typical Guns N' Roses music, but I love how they  play together.

B0001IN080|3.0|M. Buble is excellent in his singing! It looks like the producer had tried hard to promote the artist or to lengthen the recording time by adding many minutes of blah blah fillers in between songs which break the listensers' attention. The recording quality is a bit better than the sixties. At times, the brass sounds are not as clear and as sharp as the rest of the orchestra. As sound quality, it is around 3/5 as compared to Diana Krall's Live in Paris. Regrettable! I hate to press the fast forward button. In constrast, I have often used the repeat chapter button when listening to &quot;Live In Paris&quot;!
B00005JNSK|4.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Tim Burton's make on the book by Roald Dahl and his remake of the 1971 classic: \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\\"<br /><br />Johnny Depp plays Willy Wonka, a strange man who lives in a factory that makes lots of candy.  Some of it is strange candy at that (an everlasting Gobstopper and a piece of gum that holds breakfast, lunch and dinner).  Well, Wonka has decided to put Golden Tickets in his bars, five in total.  Five lucky children will be able to tour Wonka's factory.  Charlie, a poor boy who can't really afford any chocolate bars, stumbles onto the Golden Ticket after having a third bar.<br /><br />The other children who got these bars: A husky gentleman named Agustus Gloop, a rich snob named Veruca Salt, a champian named Violette and a boy who loves science named Mike Taevee.<br /><br />The movie isn't bad.  It's fairly good.  Johnny Depp makes a good Willy Wonka, but you can't replace Gene Wilder.  Johnny Depp is only good because he's good at playing strange characters, and Tim Burton often makes strange and dark films (films we love, no doubt).  Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka in my eyes.<br /><br />The look of the film is incredible!  Well, to put it simple, it's an update to the 1970's version.  Some parts look abosolutely stunning.  The special effects are top notch, and the Oompa Loompa's are pretty cool (considering only one person played all of 'em).  The songs the Oompa Loompa's sing are very good and very well choreographed.  They're NOT better than the songs in the original.  The original was more interactive and more riddle like.  This one is just here to be upbeat and \\"keep up with the times\\".<br /><br />However, the problem with this film is simple: It's virtually the same thing we saw in the 1970's version.  Some words of dialogue are almost exactly the same (Violet's monologue when she finds her golden ticket is word-for-word the same).  Everything that happens to the kids when they're \\"bad\\" is the same.  The only difference is that we get to see the kids afterwards, unlike the 1971 original.<br /><br />The changes in the story (which weren't a lot, but some were big) can sometimes be pleasant.  I didn't much care for Wonka's past, but they threw it in this film, and it made the ending a bit... stranger.  I was pleased that we saw what happened to the kids as well.  Wonka, is totally different than what he was in the original, and in the book.  Courtesy of Johnny Depp.  In the original he was a lonely guy but was testing to see if the kids would steal his greatest invention, the everlasting Gobstopper.  In this, there's no real test to see who should keep his factory.  It's all based on who the last kid left is (the one Wonka will say is the \\"Least rotten\\").<br /><br />It's a good film.  The look Tim Burton gives it is nothing short of brilliant.  The children who visit his factory are forgettable, except for maybe Charlie who manages to be BETTER than the original Charlie (although I was disappointed that the song \\"I got a golden ticket\\" didn't play when he got it).<br /><br />There are funny moments, some you'll die of laughter.  Johnny Depp delivers the character of Wonka very well, but as I stated before: Gene Wilder WAS Willy Wonka.  Filling Wilder's shoes is hard, and not even Johnny Depp (who after Pirates of the Caribbean seems to be the guy to get for your \\"strange\\" people) could surpass him.<br /><br />Before I close I will say one other thing.  The music is perhaps one of the best musical scores I've ever heard in a movie before.  Most Tim Burton films have excellent music, and this is no exception.  Each track goes along quite well with the situation.  The opening theme is the best one!<br /><br />Will fans of the original like it?  More than not.  Some will abosolutely hate it!  If you loved the original for it's characters and such: you probably won't like this one.  But if you enjoyed it for the story... it's nothing new, virtually it's theexact same as the original with an extended ending and update in it's look to make it more \\"modern\\".<br /><br />I'd say the original is better, but this one is just as good.  The characters (with the exception of Charlie) aren't really anything to write home about, but overall this is a good film.'s nothing new, virtually it's the exact same as the original with an extended ending and update in it's look to make it more \\"modern\\".   <br /> <br />I'd say the original is better, but this one is just as good.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I was one of the first few who actually liked Coldplay when they first released over here in the US, but I never knew anything about them. Then, almost all of a sudden, their popularity spread like a wildfire, and were followed by other British sensations. I found out more about them, got their albums from \\"Parachutes\\" to \\"Live 2003,\\" and I counted the days until this came out. Boy, was it worth the wait. <br /> <br />Of course, not just because they happened to be one of my favorite band, I waited until I heard the first single off their new album, which is \\"Speed of Sound.\\" Already, I was about to pee my pants for June 7th to come.  <br /> <br />Because of my lack of funds, I finally was able to purchase it (well, my bf got it for me). I opened it as fast as I could without breaking anything, put it into the car CD player, and I sat up with perked ears to listen to the sounds. I fell in love with it after the first thirty seconds!!! The lyrics are just as meaningful and infectious as they were before, as were the melodies and tunes.  <br /> <br />Coldplay still manages to keep its authenticity and roots as a deep and harmonious music group. I hope they continue to grow and create the art they paint each time they make a new song.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Nominated for 6 Golden Globes and 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, The Aviator wows audiences with its breadth of scenery and vivid realism. Director Martin Scorsese, known for a host of excellent films such as Raging Bull (1980), Goodfellas (1990), Casino (1995), and Gangs Of New York (2002) - not to mention the highly controversial The Last Temptation Of Christ (1988) - by no doubt turns out his best work since Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci) sought to become a made man. The Aviator springs to life with nostalgic settings and a lavish tapestry of color and form, evoking all the enthusiasm indicative of Howard Hughes' unique lust for life. John Logan, known for such films as The Last Samurai (2003) and Gladiator (2000), presents a screenplay that provides some insight into the enigmatic Hughes and captures the mannerisms of those who shared that life with him. In short, the film is a masterpiece of visual imagery and first-rate cinematography few movie lovers can afford to miss... <br /> <br />The Aviator focuses on the early life (1930-1947) of America's most eccentric and bewildering billionaire playboy, Howard Hughes. Know for his seemingly erratic business dealings and fearless sense of adventure, Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) turned a small inherited fortune into an enormous corporate empire. And along the way, he captured the imagination of those around him with an attitude that embraced risk and life itself. Inheriting a majority interest in the Hughes Tool Company (founded by his father), Hughes embarks on a career in Hollywood where he produces a number of notable films including Hell's Angels, The Front Page, and Scarface. Hughes' obsessive dedication to perfection makes his stock rise in Hollywood and even helps launch the career of Jean Harlow... <br /> <br />But Howard Hughes is not just a one-trick pony, and his interest soon turns to the flourishing aviation industry where he becomes an integral part of TWA and pilots his own planes on a regular basis. His driving energy would lead Hughes to enter the defense industry, the electronics industry, Las Vegas casinos, and numerous other activities in the years ahead. But along the way, he deals with a cast of characters colorful in their own right. Romances with Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsale) and Katherine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett) provide insight into Hughes' personal life, while Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly), Hughes' assistant and right-hand man, sacrifices much in his own life to enable Hughes to live out his latest visions and inspirations. When Hughes makes the bold move of constructing the Spruce Goose - the largest airplane ever built (and able to land on water no less) - Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda) accuses the billionaire of war-profiteering. Hughes takes on the Senator full-force and with all the zest that marked his previous ventures. Vowing that the Spruce Goose will fly, in the face of highly publicized claims that it will not, Hughes proves his critics wrong, and the Spruce Goose rises to the occasion... <br /> <br />Despite its loss to Million Dollar Baby at the Oscars, The Aviator can take pride in being nominated as one of the best films of the year (along with Finding Neverland, Ray, and Sideways). And the film is certainly deserving of that high honor. Few films better illustrate the beauty of America, or more importantly, the mountains that can be moved when a single individual lives his life with ambition, drive, inspiration, and a naked enthusiasm for all that life has to offer. Overall, The Aviator is among the best films of the past several years, and movie aficionados would be well-advised to watch every last minute with same enthusiasm of a young Howard Hughes... <br /> <br />The DVD Report
B00000J7SS|1.0|Forget this nightmare! It's like a bad acid trip.  First of all, I promoted Miles Davis in a Tampa concert on August 6, 1973 along with Stevie Wonder and found him to be the rudest, meanest and downright nastiest entertainer I've ever done business with.  This album typifies his demeanor. After the concert, I asked Miles, \\"Would you like a beer, Miles?\\"  He rasped at me with the press in the room, \\"I tell you what I really want...I want my money 'fore I rip your hair out!\\" That's no way to treat your employer.  That's no way to treat a fan since 1959. Yes, fans the stories are true, Miles at one time was the paragon of jazz creativity.  But by 1970, being always a bitter man, he felt threatened by Sly Stone and created this pseudo-intellectual exercise in doom, gloom and depression.  Anyone who finds this CD beautiful or a \\"work of art\\" must have velvet paintings of Tom Jones in their living room.  The cover art is awful too.  Let's face it, by 1970, when this album was recorded, Miles was a physical wreck, due to years of heroin abuse, and his mind was gone.  Even Herbie Hancock around 1963 took abuse from Miles when as a 19-year old he joined his band.  Even though Miles was a major league jerk, I still admire his early stuff from 1957 to about 1965, but this overrated crap should be sent to the \\"grooveyard\\". R.I.P.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Nominated for 3 Academy Awards and 3 Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy, The Phantom Of The Opera is one of the most talked about movies of 2004. Taking the smash commercial success of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage production to the big screen is no easy task, but long-time Hollywood director Joel Schumacher is more than able to get the job done. He takes an otherwise poorly written screenplay (minus the awe of a live performance no less) and manages to thrill the audience with the visual aspects of a film chiefly intended to rehash a successful stage musical. The costumes and set are simply magnificent, and Art Director John Fenner (Raiders Of The Lost Ark) helps Schumacher put together a fabulous production that's well worth a movie-goer's time... <br /> <br />The Phantom Of The Opera centers around a mysterious character who dwells underneath the Paris Opera House, imbibing himself on the music that emanates from above. Known as The Phantom (Gerard Butler), he wears a half-mask to cover the hideous facial scars that have plagued him since birth. A musical genius, the phantom is infatuated with the opera, and when he falls in love with the voice of a young chorus girl named Christine (Emmy Rossum - The Day After Tomorrow (2004), Mystic River (2003)), this love of the opera morphs into an outright obsession. The phantom provides Christine with one-on-one voice lessons, while during his spare time, he terrorizes the opera house in an effort to land his protg the opera's leading role. When Christine finally rises to that position, however, she is reunited with childhood friend Raul (Patrick Wilson), and the two begin a torrid love affair. Vengeful and jealous, the phantom kidnaps Christine and holds her prisoner in his underground lair, and Raul is the only one who can save her... <br /> <br />Onscreen, The Phantom Of The Opera is weak by the standards of a traditional film. The cast does its best to make the most of a screenplay peppered with rigid dialogue - a script designed to sell \\"the music of the night\\". The supposed magnetism between Christine and Raul is non-existent and not really believable. As such, the audience is forced into believing that the phantom (who, by contrast, is quite charismatic in this rendition) would end up playing second fiddle to a man who makes Al Gore seem animated. Overall, however, other aspects of the film make up for this flaw... <br /> <br />Based on Gaston Leroux's 1925 novel of the same name, The Phantom Of The Opera loses much of its original edge given the phantom's transformation from a frightening and mangled lunatic to a watered down half-scarred/half-babe-magnet figure complete with likeable characteristics. But inevitably, that's the mark of an enduring franchise - its malleability in the realm of numerous genres and the public's willingness to embrace such changes. But arguably, the small changes in the original novel's plot were necessary to achieve Lloyd Webber's goal of a melodramatic and stirring Broadway musical boasting mass commercial appeal. In a year in which the Oscar nominations were mostly dominated by lower-budget, surprise hit films (such as Sideways, Million Dollar Baby, and Finding Neverland), The Phantom Of The Opera holds its own in many aspects (given its pre-production designation as a commercial success). But those who have not seen the stage version are unlikely to be won over to the ranks of the franchise's numerous fanatics. My advice is to definitely see the film if you've ever seen the stage performance or listened regularly to the soundtrack - otherwise, you might be disappointed. After all, no matter how good The Phantom Of The Opera translates to the big screen, there's a reason musicals are not the dominate genre in Hollywood... <br /> <br />The DVD Report

B00006RCNW|5.0|Nominated for 4 Emmys and 4 Golden Globes, including Best Television Series - Drama, The Shield is one of the top police dramas of the past decade. The brainchild of creator Shawn Ryan, writer for such hit shows as Nash Bridges (1996) and Angel (1999), The Shield made history in 2003 by becoming the first basic cable series to win a Golden Globe for Best Drama Series (in the past, only non-ad supported shows such as The Sopranos and Sex And The City have done so well). The hour-long drama boasts a strong, well-rounded cast who, along with the writers/producers, have managed to make The Shield the longest running series on the FX Network... <br /> <br />The Shield centers around an inner-city Los Angeles police precinct where the lines between right and wrong are often blurred. An ongoing power struggle between a group of corrupt, yet effective, cops and their new boss, Capt. David Aceveda (Benito Martinez), remains the focal point of the show. Det. Vic Mackey (Michael Chiklis, of The Commish) heads up an elite unit known as the Strike Team. An effective leader who bends the rules when they fit his aims, Mackey often butts heads with the by-the-book Aceveda who weighs his own political ambitions against the cost of bringing down Mackey and his associates. Veteran Det. Claudette Wyms (CCH Pounder, of ER) knows the ropes, admires Mackey, but also knows how to play sides of the game. For the 2005 season, Glenn Close - star of such films as The Natural (1984), Fatal Attraction (1987), and Air Force One (1997) - joined the cast as Capt. Monica Rawling. Together, this celebrated cast maintains an internal tension among themselves while carrying out a unified fight against the criminal element - a fight that keeps the streets of L.A. safe... <br /> <br />The Shield (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the season premiere in which the Strike Team has tightened its stranglehold over the precinct. Capt. Aceveda tries to crack down on the corruption in his force by recruiting an insider (Det. Terry Crowley) to help take down Vic Mackey, but the operation only results in the Crowley's death. In the interim, Det. Wyms and her partner Det. \\"Dutch\\" Wagenbach (Jay Karnes) investigate the murder of a woman only to discover that her missing daughter was sold off to a child molester by her drug addict father... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include \\"Dawg Days\\" in which Mackey attempts to establish a cease-fire between two rival gangs whose ongoing feud threatens the peace, and \\"Dragonchasers\\" in which Mackey tries to help a crack addict quit so she can maintain custody of her son while Dutch tracks down a serial killer... <br /> <br />Below is a list of episodes included on The Shield (Season 1) DVD: <br /> <br />Episode 1 (Pilot)  <br />Episode 2 (Our Gang)  <br />Episode 3 (The Spread)  <br />Episode 4 (Dawg Days)  <br />Episode 5 (Blowback)  <br />Episode 6 (Cherrypoppers)  <br />Episode 7 (Pay in Pain)  <br />Episode 8 (Cupid & Psycho)  <br />Episode 9 (Throwaway)  <br />Episode 10 (Dragon Chasers)  <br />Episode 11 (Carnivores)  <br />Episode 12 (Two Days of Blood)  <br />Episode 13 (Circles)  <br /> <br />The DVD Report

The album appears to have a little satire (Death on Two Legs - Lazing on a Sunday Afternoon, Good Company, & Seaside Rendezvous) to great story telling of love and adventure (I'm in love with my car, You're My Best Friend, '39,) with a touch of the dark (The Prophet's Song and Bohemian Rhapsody) thrown in. A great album for the ages!!
1400076943|5.0|I began this book while traveling and found it in the bedroom of a friend. She had good taste. Upon returning home I bought the book, and finished it in record time. In the end, to sum it up, it was the sweetest and most endearing book I've read in years. I plan to send it to my 14 year old and my 31 year old sisters. The characters are complex, dimensional, realistic and cunning; the plot is ironic, keen and engrossing; the writing is phenomenal. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B000000JO3|5.0|While some are quick to try to compare this album to Fugazi, there was no Fugazi when there was Minor Threat. Instead, this was the beginning of D.C. hardcore punk done at its best. That would seem like a stretch to some, but the tracks were not even meant to make a difference, yet did somehow anyway. If it were all about not having casual sex, drinking, smoking, or drug use, it wouldn't be the full mile of what makes it so great (although that's one factor that does). Minor Threat are capable of good songs, and you get 26 of them on this disc.    And only a handful of tracks are about what's mentioned above. What's misunderstood is that \\"Straight Edge\\" was not even a scene until people liked the message so much in the song. Only forty-five seconds, it was moving enough anyway. Many of the really short songs are also the easiest to get into. And then, if you live in D.C., you know how racially divided it is there, so it's nice to hear a track like \\"Guilty of Being White\\", which is an ode at being blamed for being racist (and causing slavery) for simply being white. And you get one that they even kid themselves on the band's antics, \\"Cashing In\\", something people have always wanted to accuse Ian's future band of doing. It also is a no-BS record, which makes me love it so much. You don't even have to be punk to like it, I know that I am not!    It is a compilation which was created so you could buy all of this for a low price as opposed to having to still cash out money for the two EPs (tracks 1-8; 11-15), Out of Step (15-23), and the \\"Salad Days\\" single (24-26). You get it all here, and the records are still sought after, since they've since become the punk thing... vinyl format. To me, that's what also makes it five stars is that Minor Threat have a lot of greatness in that it's just about enjoying the music. Not to mention both songs from the Flex Your Head compilation album appear here.

This book told me that the longer I hold on to the hurt the more damage I do to myself.  What happend back then happend and that's all there is to it.  Letting go of the memories is quite a blessing.
B00006LI4S|5.0|I cannot believe I passed up chances to see this live.  Why?  Why?? <br /> <br />This DVD... is amazing.  I don't live and breath Pink Floyd, though I certainly think they made some grand music.  But after listening to this DVD I certainly put David Gilmour in the top echelon of rock guitarists.  He's up there with Clapton, Hendrix, anyone.   <br /> <br />My wife doesn't like Pink Floyd.  At all.  Hates 'em as a matter of fact.  But she listened to this DVD (didn't watch it, she was just in the room while I watched it) and afterwards when I asked her why people don't respect Gilmour as a guitarist as much as they should she said \\"I don't know, he's really damn good.\\". <br /> <br />That from someone who does NOT like Pink Floyd, after hearing this DVD. <br /> <br />I'm going to watch this again tonight.  Awesome.
B000002NAK|3.0|First, I have to say that to those who say that this musical made them into Eva Pern fans... PLEASE go rewatch it, because you totally missed the point.    Anyway, I come from an interesting POV on this soundtrack: the \\"Evita\\" movie was one of my first exposures to musicals.  I think that a part of me loves it just because I grew up listening to it.  However, as I grew older and got more and more into musical theatre, \\"Evita\\" sort of faded into the background.  My friend has the OLC and he had me listen to it once; I found myself preferring the movie soundtrack.  This made me feel quite guilty.  I mean, what kind of a theatre fan did THAT make me?      But then when I saw the musical onstage, I realized how much the movie was missing.  I decided to check out the OBC, which is supposedly the best; though I was apprehensive because I am really not a Patti LuPone fan (I suppose that's musical blasphemy, but it's how I feel.  I saw her as Fosca in a filmed stage production of Sondheim's \\"Passion\\" and thought she was terrible)  So I now consider myself educated enough to make a solid judgment on this recording.    For starters, I love \\"Evita.\\"  It is one of four ALW shows that I actually like, and my favorite non-JCS show (I consider JCS in an entirely different league)  It's very unique to have a show include such intense politics, and also have a main character whom the audience is supposed to somehow like despite her being a total manipulative (...).    The instrumentals in the movie soundtrack are quite lush, probably because it's newer than the OLC and OBC.  I don't like some of the rearrangements, though.  But I do like how they actually give transitions in between the songs because the OBC tends to just jump into songs with absolutely no lead into them, which is a bit jarring.  Also, it annoys me how they cut out some of the coolest bits of the show.  Like the \\"Ride on my train, oh my people\\" line in the beginning that is so pretty in the OBC, it always takes meby surprise no matter how often I've heard it.    Madonna as Evita... I have never heard an Evita that I've loved.  Not even when a singer I normally love, like Marla Schaffel, does the role.  Everyone plays her as such a showy (...), singing very hard; it drives me crazy--I especially despise Julie Covington's portrayal.  Madonna doesn't, but she plays her too softly.  There must be a happy medium somewhere!  Vocally, she's okay.  Her breathy style gets on my nerves; she merely treads lightly when she should be pounding.  Because of this, she's unable to form an emotional connection.  She shapens up around when Eva gets sick... probably because her weak singing fits that of a sick person... but by then it's too late as there is no emotional connection.  I like \\"You Must Love Me\\" but the fact that it's there is sad.  It shouldn't have to be there.  Patti LuPone, probably my favorite Eva, actually had me almost crying without having to sing some simpering, out-of-character ballad.  Don't get me wrong, I like the song.  But not for Eva.    Some of Eva's good parts were removed too; a lot of her snippy lines were transferred to other characters, which took the edge off of her character.  Like many others, I was also upset by the decision to make Magaldi leave Eva instead of the other way around.      Antonio Banderas... I am going to come right out and say that I HATE how Che is always played by an old white guy onstage, like the type who plays Jean Valjean (I have yet to find more than one Che who HASN'T played Valjean at some point) when he's supposed to be this young, fiery Argentine.  Despite his lack of singing ability (though he is AMAZING in his original language of Spanish) and tendency to hiss out words instead of sing them, Antonio Banderas captures Che perfectly.  I didn't like Mandy Patinkin much (he sings like a 1930's salesman, he sounded bored throughout the OBC, and his Spanish pronounciation was TERRIBLE) and Colm Wilkinson, though I love him, just doesn't have the feel for Che.  I also like how the movie doesn't portray Che as Che Guevara; I think that ALW's making Che into the communist revolutionary was a ridiculously bad mistake; it ruins the character and isn't even historically accurate, as Che did not develop a political conscience until long after Eva's death.    What is unfortunate is how many of Che's great parts were removed.  Like the \\"What's new, Buenos Aires!?\\" part of \\"She is a Diamond\\" that I've always loved.    As for the minor roles... I've never much liked Jonathon Pryce; in this he is mediocre as always.  Of course, in the production I saw Pern was even less memorable; maybe it's because Eva totally upstages him.  And at least he doesn't have the horrendously fake Spanish accent the Pern in the OBC does.  As for Magaldi... he's not supposed to be amazing (\\"You'll never be remembered for your voice!\\") but he's supposed to be believable as a tango singer who makes all of the girls swoon.  This Magaldi did neither.    I agree that this version of \\"Evita\\" is a little too pro-Eva.  But, for a musical movie, it's actually pretty good.  ALW likes to sell out (coughPhantomcough) so we should be thankful that we got as good of a cast as we did. I think that overall though I prefer the OBC just because the movie soundtrack cut out so many of the good parts... and, of course, the singing is better.
B0000025HG|4.0|WET is a nice album from Barbra Streisand. It was the third album in her career produced by Gary Klein. There are 9 songs, 6 of which are ballads. In my opinion, the album would have been stronger without the uptempo songs. Those songs include \\"Splish Splash\\" (one of the weaker songs), \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\" and the smash disco hit \\"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\\" with Donna Summer. The duet is a great song but it seems out of place on here. The songs have an aquatic theme, all about water in some form, so it is a concept album. The ballads are nice and Barbra sounds beautiful. My favorites are \\"Wet\\", \\"Niagara\\", \\"Kiss Me In The Rain\\" and \\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\".
B000002B5L|5.0|And one of my top thirty, maybe even twenty favorites of all-time. I used to be more of a fan of the subgenre until I started getting disappointed in some of it and I was getting into more alternative/rock stuff. Even with that it has not waned my interest of this album. While there's some rapping from all of them, you also hear some hints of reggae and soul, both done well and with some excellent production. I was so glad when I heard that they were reuniting. While I like Wyclef's solo stuff alright and enjoyed Lauryn's album, it would be nice to hear more from them. The covers of Roberta Flack and Bob Marley are nicely done, but you should also listen to the original songs that they do hear; all are presented well. <br /> <br />The skits are not really my favorites but seem to serve a purpose, and are usually just put at the end of most of the songs anyway. Discussed in most of these songs are social issues, and this record is kind of a commentary of that. It doesn't come off as pretentious in the least bit, which makes it nice. The two remixes of \\"Fu-Gee-La\\" are okay with me, particularly because that's my favorite song from the album. Then there's \\"Mista, Mista\\" which is mainly just Wyclef and the guitar. The instrumentation on this album is nice; I wish that was how it was more often (although the instrumentation of \\"Killing Me Softly\\" in parts is not all that different from what A Tribe Called Quest had several years back on the classic \\"Bonita Applebum\\"). Even the samples are nice, like the Enya one that others are also trying to sample in their songs. Pras has good rapping skills as well in spite of the fact that he doesn't generally stand out to the people as much as the other two. This album still is frequently repeated by me even today.
B000001E18|4.0|It's easy to see how \\"Zooropa\\" might have gotten lost among other U2 albums, especially when following \\"Achtung Baby\\". However, I believe \\"Zooropa\\" is almost as perfect, and it's one of my top U2 discs. Even when compared to a much different album like \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", it's hard to choose a favorite. The title track is one of their best openers ever, and has an energy that just grabs you and shakes you. \\"Numb\\" is one of those risks that paid off well, and is as catchy and unique as anything they've done, much like \\"Lemon\\". \\"Stay (far away, so close!)\\" is a classic U2 ballad, and while it seems simple, is quite emotional and moving. \\"First Time\\" and \\"Dirty Day\\" are both moody tracks, and \\"The Wanderer\\" with Johnny Cash is quite possibly one of the coolest things they've ever done. Similar to both \\"Achtung Baby\\" and \\"Pop\\", \\"Zooropa\\" isn't just a 90's must, it's an essential U2 album, for me anyway.
6305692572|5.0|I am a recovering alcoholic. My husband & I first saw this movie June 12/05 at a detox center in Alaska where our vacation was cut very short due to my nervous system shutting down, due to several years of alcohol abuse. This movie was used in one of our classes in rehabilitation. We were facinated. It told our story. The movie is for the struggling alcoholic & for the loved ones involved. Everyone one is affected by this most crippling disease. This movie is a must \\"tool\\" for anyone especially new to sobriety. I even still watch it when I feel a need to. It is very real & most excellent. <br />          Thank You <br />         Bernadette <br />
0064431622|5.0|This is a great book that reinforces a strong message to children. I read this book every year in my classroom during the first week of school. I do not focus on the colors in the book - I feel that the story's value lies in the message that everyone is unique and special. The kind of responses that children offer in response to this high-quality piece of literature is amazing....a great read, in the classroom and at home.
B00000JAXT|5.0|In sharp contrast to the debut self-titled \\"Matching Mole\\", there's a great deal of evidence - to the ear alone - that each band member collaborated and contributed throughout the process from song-writing to final product.<br /><br />Robert Wyatt's presence, as always, obvious ... one very tall man regardless of his stature or, later, wheelchair.<br /><br />Bill McCormick: a soloist, a tunesmith, and a solid reliable Canterbury sound.  And that's precisely what a bass player should be in this context.<br /><br />Phil Miller always seemed to have to suffer pain to play.  He puts an incredible amount of effort into doing what he does, and it showed when I saw him live.  I was happy to hear him more to the fore, both playing and writing.<br /><br />Dave McCrae. He's no Joe Zawinul, he's Dave McCrae.  This album made his mark for me.  He pushed the early 70's gear further than it was designed to go, and without him this album would not be so remarkable. As good as Dave Sinclair was, I don't think he could have managed the same effect.<br /><br />Miller and McCrae give the whole direction of the album more of a fusion sound than the first album had, and although some feel it doesn't work too well, I disagree strongly.<br /><br />The most notable difference, however, is the atmospheric contribution of Brian Eno on VCS3.  Don't expect to hear something of what might now be called the \\"Eno sound\\", though. This was before digital, where synth players had to know about the construction of sound as well as the construction of music.  Eno gives an air of Morton Subotnick, The Twilight Zone, and inhaled surrealism to this album.  Not Roxy Music, not Music For Airports.<br /><br />The same goes for Bob Fripp's production ... this isn't Swastika Girls, not Septober Energy (although it comes close). There's an occasional production glitch - most notably with keyboards being a little too hot (to my ears, perhaps not yours), but without detracting from the music.  I'm glad that's all he did; his guitar is not what I'd want to hear on this album<br /><br />All together, the tracks form a whole experience.  Of course the original was on vinyl, two sides with the natural break between each.  But played on CD, straight through from beginning to end, it's more of a journey.<br /><br />I've read that one reviewer discarded this album after one listening.  Only one!!!  So much music has been rejected without effort!<br /><br />It's not only the reviewer's loss, but also a loss for you if you follow his advice and not bother with this album.  Sometimes good music takes more than one handful of hearings to make itself clear.  And that's true for most of Robert Wyatt's work until you accept him as he is.<br /><br />Wyatt has the rare ability to create poignantly serious lyrics and music that are filled with humor and romance with a tinge of surreal strangeness.  In that, he's a poet and an artist.  But in all the covers of his songs that I've heard, the elements only come together when they are sung in his unique voice.  That was true for the debut album, and it's no less true for the second and last release during the band's lifetime.<br /><br />Put that together with the obvious skills of the other musicians, and what have you got.  It's probably \\"Music for musicians\\" more than it is \\"Music for the masses\\", which seems a little out of place given the album title, and Wyatt's burgeoning political voice.<br /><br />Take the time, make the effort, and you will be rewarded.  Sure, it's a typical example of 1970's progrock in some ways.  I bought the album when it was originally released in the UK, and it does begin to sound a little dated.  But there is still an overwhelming uniqueness to the whole thing.  There wasn't anything exactly like this before, and there hasn't been anything exactly like this since.  For me, it will always be a landmark in my musical journey. Listen to it, and find out where it takes you.  Explore.<br /><br />Choice picks: GloriaGloom, God Song, Righteous Rhumba, Nan True's thingy (virgin sex!!), and of course SITMOTDWCDOPA.  Hahahaha!  Darn it, the whole album. Sex, laughs, music, drinking, politics... what else is there?  Religion.ong, Righteous Rhumba, Nan True's thingy (virgin sex!!), and of course SITMOTDWCDOPA.  Hahahaha!  Darn it, the whole album. Sex, laughs, music, drinking, politics... what else is there?  Religion.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay's dangerously close to being a victim of its own success, and X&Y embodies this tragic development in their overreliance on formula, demographic hippieness and industry presssure to be BIG, big, big--the next U2!!--most of all.  The brilliance of Coldyplay's earlier albums lay in a quirky sensitvity; with X&Y, every single track is overengineered, overly measured, and too self conscious of its popularity to make the listeneer want to actually listen.  martin seems to rotate between a prozac-improved Bob Dylan and nicer but just as egotistical version of Clapton in his lyrics and singing style, and the songs, many of which have potential to be great, get lost in the band's tendency towards anthemic display of synthesizer grandiosity.  \\"Fix You\\" for example, could be a beautiful little song if they had some creativity with the actual music--Speed of Sound, which so many people rave about, was entirely disappointing--a monochrome of obnoxiousness--as though the listeners are so stupid as to not need a little variation in the music.   They seem to be unsure of whether to become a band known for performance, or for artistry.  As a result, they deliver very little, and I was left feeling as though each song came close to something interesting, and then lost it in its own anxiety of itself.  Perhaps if they hadn''t become so popular, they might have traveled down different paths creatively.  As it is, it's become a band that seeks a cult following--which is to say, a following that blindly follows.
0743487478|1.0|I was disappointed in this book. There is a little information that is useful that could be contained in a 2-3 page magazine article, but it is buried in a lot of repetitious fluff.  <br /> <br />Several things irritated me: 1) how he projects adult feelings onto children too young to think that way, as in the child wanting to watch the same TV show as peers--sorry, they are not thinking of it in terms of a \\"cultural experience\\"; 2) assuming that \\"natural consequences\\" is always practiced without any concern for mitigating circumstances--most parents would ask why a raincoat was left behind, and THEN do something, or not, depending on the answer; 3) the teenager missing dinner. Is he kidding? I don't know anyone who does that--the teen heats up his own leftovers; 4) his insistence that any form of \\"time-out\\" is actually \\"love-withdrawal\\".  Good grief. <br /> <br />The way he deals with tantrums (well, in his case, a \\"sit-down strike\\" by his child, hardly a \\"tantrum\\" judging from what I've seen in stores on occasion) by essentially waiting them out works for him because he apparently is self-employed and can make his own schedule--he probably does have lots of spare time. Many parents are not in his situation--they have appointments, are maybe shopping with two or more children at the same time, etc.  <br /> <br />Bottom line: read this book at the library first. This is the second book of his that I've read, and he seems to be long on complaining about the problem but short on real, workable solutions.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I love Coldplay!  I can't stop listening to them.  X&Y takes you on a musical and spiritual journey from beginning to end.  In a day when most bands just offend you, Coldplay actually takes you to a wonderful place that you don't want to leave.  My advice on this trip is to start at the beginning and listen all the way through.  You'll be breathless when it's over.  \\"Fix You\\" is almost a religious experience.  Buy this album and buy one for your friends.  You won't be sorry.  I wonder if some of the critics know what it's like to have music inside you.  It seems like the songs Coldplay puts out are already written in the spirit realm - Coldplay is just the vehicle that brings them to us.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I know, I know.  People use this phrase all the time, but I absolutely mean it.  No movie I know is more charming and wacky than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  The acting is top-notch.  Each character lives up to their potential.  The screenplay is superb and Burton's directing is perfect.  I am 100% honest.  This remake, or reimagining, is in all ways better than the original.  Danny Elfman's music is astounding.  Whether it's the song about the downfall of a naughty child or the intro(that gave me the chills, by the way)to this work of art is enchanting in every sense of the word.  If you haven't seen this movie already, see it as soon as possible.  Very likely the best and certainly one of the most memorable movies I've ever seen.

B0002OERI0|5.0|I own four Green Day albums. By far, this is one of the most masterful. In fact, this was the first Green Day album I owned. It encouraged me to listen to their older music, which was great! American Idiot introduced me to the whole hard rock/punk rock scene. I have never left it since I heard this album. <br /> <br />This is a true work of art.
B00006ADFL|5.0|What can I say about this movie?  It really touched me.  It's about two girls, Juliet and Pauline, who become friends and face several hardships which eventually lead them to murder one of their parents.  There's more to it then that though.  The two girls, they make up their own world, with their own characters with their own rules.  They eventually depend on each other.  I guess what gets to me about the film is about how real it felt.  What the girls do, they run around, play about, write stories, idolize the teen idols of the day (Including Mario Lanza and James Mason.  Orson Wells is excluded from their idols because Juliet calls him hideous.), they way they interact with each reminds me of what I do with my friends, and that one friend in particual.  Of course, I'm 15 the age of these girls so I relate to them much more then an adult would, I believe.  It's a darker tone film with some quirky effects that one expects from Peter Jackson.  Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey give stunning performances, especially since this was their film debut.  It doesn't contain the gore that one would expect considering Jackson's previous works like Braindead and Bad Taste, but there is one murder scene but it's truly chilling, ranking up there with one of the worse murders to be filmed, on my own opinion.  I love this film to death and it makes me cry every time I see it.  It just feels, so real.  Even when clay figures come to life in the girl's fantasy, it doesn't seem to break any barriers, it feels with in reach of reality.   <br />I highly reccomend at least one viewing.  If you're under 18 you may find a few things hit a bit closer to home then you'd like...

B00006LFGD|5.0|This Cd is really great to have if you like Barbra alot ! or if you like her occasionaly.This is a perfect Cd with all her great Duets with people like Sinatra , Ray Charels , KIm Carnes ,Celine Dion , Donna Summers ,Judy Garland ,and Barry Gibb. <br />First of all every duet on this Cd is great having some great Duets with Barbra's great Voice like \\" No More Tears , One Less Bell To Answer , Tell Him , Guilty , Get Happy/Happy Days are here agian. The New Duets are also great with Barry Manilow & Josh Groban , In my opinioun the Barry Manilow one was better then the Groban one is becuase of the song writing for \\" I wont be the one to let go (with Barry). IF you own The Esstential Records .. this would be also great to have with it , So buy this Album you will love it also if you like Streisand consider buying Just For The Record 4 Cd Set or The Esstential Recordings
B00005JKC3|4.0|This is a mindblower.... some external reviwers have panned that the Hulk got a serious treatment, but to my mind - it`s all for the better:-))) The only letdown is that I do miss TV`s Lou Ferrigno in the titlerole(although he is a trifle old to have played the role, though he DOES make a walk-on in the film as a securuty-guard early on in the film)..<br /><br />The Hulk is unfortunately a bit too unreal, you don`t achieve the sympathy for the character,  Lou`s Hulk received...<br /><br />But all in all; a GREAT movie and a great experience.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Octavarium shows a break on what was DT main goal on the two past albums: dark and fast, mostly metal-oriented, song-writing. Of course those elements are present on this album as well, but only as a couple of tracks. Octavarium opens with \\"The Root Of All Evil\\", yet another element on the never-ending saga that started with \\"The Glass Prison\\"  and later continued with \\"This Dying Soul\\". Musically speaking, the song remains pretty much on the vein of the above mentioned, that is...a clear, well delivered and powerfull metal sound. As a part of Dream Theater's conceptual continuity the song does a clear reference to the its immediate predecessor phrasing: \\"I can feel my body breaking, i can feel my body breaking...\\" with a nice slowed-down version of its guitar riff. This time I think the lyrics are just fine, though i'm never pleased with Portnoy's. 4.8/5 <br />Next track, \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" is a \\"slow\\" song, very beutifull, very similar to \\"The Spirit Carries On\\". 3.5/5 <br />Third one, \\"These Walls\\": Horrible. Starts with guitar sound very similar to Tool's \\"Prison Sex\\", not a bad thing. Except for the clean guitar passages, \\"These Walls\\" is pretty much a Nu-Metal track, with a catchy chorus with a couple of power chords. Clean guitar and all keys are great, otherwise this song will be completely pointless and boring. what about the Lyrics? suck. next! 3/5 <br /> <br />\\"I walk beside you\\". mmm...yes, it is clearly U2 influenced; yes, is somehow similar to other \\"simple\\" Dream Theater songs like To Live Forever. Boring lyrics: 2/5 <br /> <br />\\"Panic Attack\\". Great!!!, another metal-oriented track, just great. 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Never Enough\\", another good one, i really, really love the vocals on this one, a little bit of experimentation from mr. La Brie. congrats!!. 5/5 <br /> <br />\\"Octavarium\\", wow, a refreshing, prog-rock epic song. Almost no metal riffing. Starts with a loooooooooong sort of \\"Shine on crazy diamond\\" keys intro. Clean guitars, nice smoothvocals, fast keys-guitar scales, all of what is Dream Theater about but this time packed as a 70's epic prog rock classic. Worth enough for a EP, like A Change Of Seasons. 5/5
B000002KDS|5.0|As a 14 year old kid in 1971 I bought this record because I liked the sound of \\"Be My Lover\\". I'm amazed today thinking back to that era that it got any radio play at all. Mostly all you heard on the radio back then was the bubble gum crap those of us from that generation had to endure. But anyways, I can't begin to describe how Alice Cooper changed my life. Suddenly I was a man. No longer would I be a zitty faced kid listening to the likes of Elton John and the Raspberries. That was kiddy stuff! But this here...This was a young mans ticket to the bigs! He made me cool, and popular with the chicks. I exhibited a newfound confidence as well as a raw edginess that lifted a young man up and smacked him in the face with reality.  <br />     All of that from one album!?? Not really. But it was the beginning. There was nothing at the time to compare Alice Cooper to. Many have followed his footsteps. Most have failed miserably. If you never listen to anything else by Alice Cooper, listen to the \\"Killer\\" album. Of course, you can't be wisked away to the early 70's, nor can you expect life changes from a 34 years old album any more...But \\"Once upon a time\\"...
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This movie is interesting and worth watching, but maybe a little over-hyped.  I bought this movie just reading the reviews from here and thought I would be blown away.  I did like the movie and felt bad for the characters sometimes and other times thought they deserved what they got for doing drugs.  Overall it is a very tragic movie with no happy ending.  I think the woman who plays the mother does an excellent job and I was really surprised that Jennifer Connely played the role she did.  She played it well but I am suprised to see her like that.  So check out the movie it is good, and don't do drugs.
B00004W52U|5.0|While relatively well-known within the confines of the punk genre, Operation Ivy never really got the same kind of publicity Rancid would achieve later on during the 1990's. I think it would be a bold statement saying this, but Operation Ivy completely surpassed anything Rancid has ever accomplished in their career... and they did it with this very album.<br /><br />It's not hard to point out why this album is such a hit among fans of third-wave ska and punk rock: the energy that flows from vocalist Tim Armstrong's voice is unparalleled. The whole band is on fire for the entire span of the album, and each song has a unique feel to it. Operation Ivy were known for their two-minute numbers dealing with numerous kinds of topics: from anti-war (\\"Unity\\") to discipline (\\"Gonna Find You\\"), Operation Ivy covered it all and went to show that even \\"punks\\" had brains of their own. In many ways, this self-titled album is proof that even punk rock can be smart. While not nearly as political as predecessors The Clash (another important punk band), the genius lyrics of Operation Ivy are one of these reasons I enjoy them so much.<br /><br />Another thing I'd like to point out: it's very evident that Operation Ivy had many different inspirations while recording this album -- and no, I'm not referring to drugs. The bluesy nature of both guitar and bass lead me to think that the guys all grew up listening to blues. The punk and ska roots are also very evident, more so in select songs than other. These three genres combined form one very likeable song, and the (although brief) solo's on this album is where the boys shine the most. Whether it's the bass is pumping out or there's a guitar riff screeching its way into the mix, it goes to show that the guys were comfortable with their respective instruments. Armstrong's voice isn't the high point of Operation Ivy, but I find that it fits quite well with the punking feel Operation has going on.<br /><br />Overall, this truly is one of the greatest punk rock albums ever.

B00078XGRO|5.0|There are no deleted scenes included in this dvd, which makes sense, because this is the only film besides Forrest Gump which test audiences said was fine as is. I read another review of this which consisted of a list of complaints abotu the film. That being said, anyone who really appreciates movies will love First Contact, both in the context of Trek, and as an action/scifi/drama movie.
B0002EXH54|5.0|<br />  In my opinion, this album is in the top five thrash albums of all time and tied at first place with \\"Rust in Piece\\". So, listen to the guitar solos, bass lines and the drum work and you will agree with me. Just buy it or die!!!!
0930289455|3.0|I read this book shortly after finishing Jeph Loeb's \\"The Long Halloween\\" and \\"Dark Victory.\\"  While both were good, they relied more on the \\"detective\\" side of batman and his confrontations with the mob.  As I was reading \\"The Killing Joke,\\" I thought to myself \\"this is the kind of story I wanted to read.\\"  A dark and twisted Joker with a little origin was very interesting.  However, the end left me desperately looking for more pages that I hoped could have just gone missing.  I'd hoped that was the case but after coming to the realization that it had in fact ended, it took me a while to accept it.  So, I hopped onto to Amazon.com to see if I was the only one that reacted this way.  Thankfully, I'm not.  Overall, a great story that I may read again because of it's short length and many strong points.  It flows beautifully.  Unfortunately, the ending pulls the plug and suddenly the bright lights cut completely off, leaving you disoriented and in disbelief that something so good could end so poorly.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|To this day, The Clash have remained one of my favorite punks bands to listen to. However, don't be so fast to label them \\"punk\\" in the same sense as other legendary bands like the Sex Pistols and The Ramones. The Clash, aptly known as \\"The Only Band That Matters\\" courtesy of Rolling Stones magazine, are anything but your stereotypical punk rock group. They bring to the table almost every genre of music possibly imaginable, and they do so superbly and better than anyone else. Whether it's jazz, ska, good old-fashioned rock n' roll, reggae, punk, hip hop, blues, etc., The Clash put it on display in London Calling.<br /><br />London Calling first came out sometime during the month of December in 1979. This was one of the years when punk rocks flame was clearly beginning to burn out. With this release, the light definitely flickered at least once or twice. This was The Clash's third record, and has been considered by many to be their greatest achievment. In fact, London Calling was given the honorable award of \\"Best Album of the 70's\\" by Rolling Stone! With all of this in mind, I think you should already be sold on the idea that maybe this double-disc album really is something special.<br /><br />For those of you that are not yet sold, however, I'll go song-by-song and give you an idea on why I highly recommend London Calling. It all starts with ringing guitar strums, followed by a deep bass line. These chords of course being the introduction to not just the CD, but the CD's title song, London Calling. Twenty-five years later, this track is still being called one of the greatest songs ever performed. The legend that is Joe Strummer makes his presence felt by churning out some awesomely political lyrics, aiming right at The Clash's hometown of London, England.<br /><br />London calling to the faraway towns<br /><br />Now that war is declared-and battle come down<br /><br />London calling to the underworld<br /><br />Come out of the cupboard, all you boys and girls<br /><br />London calling, now don't look at us<br /><br />All that phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust<br /><br />London calling, see we ain't got no swing<br /><br />'Cept for the ring of that truncheon thing<br /><br />The ice age is coming, the sun is zooming in<br /><br />Engines stop running and the wheat is growing thin<br /><br />A nuclear error, but I have no fear<br /><br />London is drowning-and I live by the river...<br /><br />Following up is two of the more bluesy, rock-a-billy songs, Brand New Cadillac and Jimmy Jazz. Both have a very retro 1950's style, especially taking into consideration the way the bass is incorporated into the songs. Brand New Cadillac is particularly simple, which makes it so much more fun to listen too. Sometimes the simplicity of certain Clash songs overshadows the more complex ones. This definitely holds true in the second and third affairs.<br /><br />From the 1950's to a less distant sound, the 70's own ska and reggae, The Clash pull out two more familiar sounding numbers, Hateful and Rudie Can't Fail. Hateful is one of the faster songs on London Calling, and I can't help but say that I really enjoy the chorus in it. Call it what you wish, I say it's catcy as all hell.<br /><br />Oh, anything I want he gives it to me<br /><br />Anything I want he gives it, but not for free<br /><br />It's hateful<br /><br />And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere<br /><br />Rudie Can't Fail gives me a very Jimmy Buffet-like impression, and it's quite obvious that The Clash were heavily influenced by reggae artists when they were either much younger or while they were writing songs for London Calling. Rudie Can't Fail is also very positive sounding, and the chant of \\"Ruuudie can't fail!\\" is loads of fun.<br /><br />Spanish Bombs returns to the more punkish side of the boys, and politics are again throw into the mix. It also includes the chorus being sung in Spanish, which is really cool. This is a very monumental track, and it hasa unique punk sound while again still maintaining a positive sound. If there's anything that The Clash don't do, it's write extremely depressing songs. Spanish Bombs is one of the better songs on London Calling.<br /><br />Spanish weeks in my disco casino<br /><br />The freedom fighters died upon the hill<br /><br />They sang the red flag<br /><br />They wore the black one<br /><br />But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill<br /><br />Back home the buses went up in flashes<br /><br />The Irish tomb was drenched in blood<br /><br />Spanish bombs shatter the hotels<br /><br />My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud<br /><br />The only song I don't really connect with is The Right Profile. It goes more along the lines of sounding like earlier song, Brand New Cadillac, than anything. But opposed to its predecessor, the song is just no fun. The only good thing I can think of it showcasing is the ska-based instruments in the background, which don't really do much for the song in the longrun.<br /><br />Song number eight is another classic, Lost In The Supermarket. As the quietest song on London Calling, it puts to use some unforgettable lyrics and musicianship. The chemistry between the band shines in this one, and Strummer's voice only adds to it all. Definitely in contention with Spanish Bombs and London Calling...<br /><br />The rest of London Calling more or less follows the ways of the tracks I just talked about. More than anything, I loved Death Or Glory, Lover's Rock, and Stand By Me. Death Or Glory was the very first song I connected with from The Clash, and upon listening I'm sure you'll see why. Another song, suitably titled Koka Kola is about - you guessed it - drugs, and it's very fast demeanor is sure to leave you dizzy and trying to keep up.<br /><br />In the end, The Clash's London Calling is perhaps the greatest album I've ever had the privilege of hearing. With comparison to a lot of other punk bands, The Clash really was the only band that mattered.

B0007Y08PQ|4.0|It was a nice change of pace to have another comedic Star Trek movie, in the spirit of Star Trek IV. The special features were impressive, especially the deleted scenes. I'm also glad that they included the featurette from the original dvd release, which was the only special feature on the first dvd. Typically, when a superior dvd is released, any special features from the original release are excluded. But I don't think the subtitle fit, it's really just Picard rebelling against Admiral Dougherty. A better one would have been, \\"Prime Directive.\\"
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is an excellent DVD. I enjoyed the interviews with the members and feel the Eagles sound even better now. This was a great purchase and encourage anyone to buy it. The delivery time was great!
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Bad special effects movie that has possibly the worse performance ever by Keanu Reeves, who almost makes the movie as bad as his performance. I don't know why Keanu was cast in this role but he's the worse actor in the entire movie and Shia LaBeouf is almost as bad as he is and gives a very annoying performance that reeks of stupidity. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare are able to give good performance in this bad movie and for that, I will not totally thrash this movie but its still not very good and you should wait for cable. <br />
0783229364|4.0|This is a classic 80's film. It's charming and fun for the whole family. Michael J. Fox does a great job as does his supporting cast. This is no epic movie, no special effects wizard, just a good old fashioned comedy about a man and the search for his dreams. Everyone should see it once. I'd reccommend it to anyone. It's clean and fun. THE PLOTLINE: Brantley Foster from Kansas travels off to the big city of New York after college graduation. He seeks a career in big business. After finally landing a job in the mail room of his uncle's billion dollar corporation, he decides to assume the identity of a big whig in the office to prove his worth and show his uncle he's capable of making great decisions and being an asset to the company. Brantley soon discovers that working two jobs at the same time takes it's toll. It's a classic Clark Kent/Superman situation. After a few key twists and turns, Brantley finds the 'secret' to his success in life. COMEDY.
B000002LJW|3.0|There's no denying that all of Clapton's best albums come from the 60s and 70s (his work with Cream, Derek and the Dominoes, Blind Faith, and his early solo albums). That being said, there were times after that when he didn't totally give in to tendencies to pap and this is one of them. Producer Russ Titelman updated his sound for the 80s with keyboards and drum machine but did it tastefully so that the album doesn't really sound \\"dated\\".<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />The song's writer Jerry Williams joins Clapton for a harmony vocal and additional guitar on \\"Pretending\\". EC lets go some nicely restrained guitar and the chorus is buoyed up by peppy synth horn along with Chaka Khan's guest vocals. Extremely 80s keyboard pads start \\"Bad Love\\", briefly leaving you to fear you're in for a power ballad..that is until Clapton unleashes the most potent riff on the disc. Phil Collins guests on skins and harmony vocal as Clapton howls \\"Had enough bad love/I need something I can be proud of\\". It's punctuated by a stinging solo at about 3:25 in and it's one of the better ones written by EC here (with help from Mick Jones of the Clash).  Robert Cray joins Clapton for a bluesy shuffle on classic \\"Before You Accuse Me\\". It's one of the more \\"organic\\" numbers here with only a trace of synth. \\"No Alibis\\" gets help from Daryl Hall and Chaka Khan on vocals.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />\\"Hound Dog\\" is nondescript: it could really be anyone playing it. To his credit, EC takes his inspiration from the Big Mama Thornton version rather than Elvis' cover. \\"Running on Faith\\" is an overstuffed faux gospel number. The lyric for \\"Lead me On\\" is pallid. (\\"Lead me on,lead me on/Lead me on,lead me on/I'll play along and along and along/Baby lead me on\\").<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />It's not a \\"must have\\" Clapton album, but any Clapton fan will probably enjoy more of it than not. It's aimed at the charts but not the sappy adult contemporary fare he'd head toward later. If you're just dipping your toes in, though, and want to find out what Clapton's all about, pick up THE CREAM OF CLAPTON (ASIN B000001EEA) as your primer.<br /><br />3 1/2 starsClapton's all about, pick up THE CREAM OF CLAPTON (ASIN B000001EEA) as your primer.    3 1/2 stars
B0007YXREA|5.0|Best Puppet film ever! Most would find no humour in it because well, they have no humor what so ever! Great peice of work! It should get a oscar! The jokes are well done, the facial features are hilarious, the voice overs are just too grand. Music is well done aswell. I must say, if you are a fan of South Park or any other film by Matt Stone and Trey Parker you'll drool all over this one!
0393312836|5.0|To the reader who declared, \\"The theme I'm told is, 'is it better to choose evil than to be forced to do good,'\\" I have to point out that this is a misreading of Burgess' intent. The problem, or question, posed by this \\"nasty little shocker,\\" (as the book was called by Burgess himself, if I'm not mistaken), comes down to \\"what does it mean to be human, to be a moral creature?\\" In other words, why did God create humankind with free will? Why would He allow His creatures to commit evil? Wouldn't He have preferred His creatures to act peacefully and benevolently, such that he would have made them incapable of choosing malevolence and violence?    The title itself, \\"A Clockwork Orange,\\" refers, according to Burgess, to something which has the appearance of life, but which is mechanistic, its actions predetermined. An orange is an organic object, which grows naturally, while a \\"clockwork orange\\" merely apes the appearance of an organic, growing object: it is a construct, a machine which cannot change and which cannot act other than how it has been designed to act.    As a catholic, Burgess wanted to demonstrate that God gave his creatures free will--choice--in order that they come to moral behavior out of their own reasoning and spiritual/moral maturation. In other words, had God's creatures lacked the capacity to behave brutally and with evil intent, they could never become moral creatures, as they would only have been machines, capable only of acting as they had been designed. Such creatures are not alive in a spiritual sense, but are windup toys which simulate the activity of life but which are dead. Machines have no morality, and neither do creatures who cannot choose their actions. Each major section of the novel begins with the question, \\"What's it going to be then, eh?\\" A machine cannot ask or answer that question, but can only hum along performing its limited, thoughtless reflex actions. Animals, similarly, despite being organic creatures, behave largely mechanistically, in that they do not have a morality, but behave according only to instinct and inborn impulses which allow them to survive in an unforgiving but morally blank environment.     It is our capacity for free choice, even when we choose to behave evilly, which allows us to develop a morality, and this distinguishes us from animals and machines, and it is what makes us God's creatures. That Alex appreciates music and adores Beethoven indicates he has an aesthetic, a capacity to enjoy that which is not merely related to the brutal imperatives of survival, and it is this which signifies his potential for deeper human growth.    (I must point out I am an atheist, but I am speaking via the terms of Burgess' own thinking.)    The final chapter of the book, which was truncated from the original American edition of the book, and likewise from Kubrick's film, illustrates Burgess' point: in it, Alex has grown a bit older, he's perhaps in his early 20s. He's married, has children, and looks back on his career of teen hooliganism with a nostalgic enjoyment, but he's also grown out of it, and he realizes that one cannot always live such a life. He has grown in years, in experience, and he has developed a morality. Had he not been \\"cured\\" of the government's behavior modification treatment, he might never again have behaved violently, but it would not be because he had grown out of it, had CHOSEN to leave it behind. It would have been only because he could NOT have acted in any other way. He might have always harbored violent desires, or he might have had NO desires, but he would not have been a creature of God, a moral creature, because the chance to grow into that state would have been denied him. He would have been a \\"clockwork orange,\\" and not a human being.

Whats with those stupid lyrics. Then Mr.Brightside was featured on the o.c, and i loved it. The first 6 songs on the album are really good then it kind of drags out a bit.  I cant get enough of that wierd spacey tune called smile like u mean it though. great song. this is also not an album that everyone should be praising like it should be on the top 10 albums of all time. p.s i meant to give it 3.5 stars.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I'm giving this album 4 stars only in comparison to their first.  Otherwise it would get a 5.  Once again, Audioslave has put together an album that is great from the first to last track.  You can just put the CD in and listen all the way through (unlike most CD's).  But, I'm not sure I'll listen to this one 5000 times, like I did with their first CD.

Chloe Agnew start the concert a beautiful young lady only 15 years old at the time set in motion a singing event that the heavens themselves stood still to listen to. The full orchestra that played while these lady's sang gave a sound that put the angels in heaven on notice that you can be replaced. Lisa Kelly's \\"May It Be\\" was so great I do not even have a word to describe it.

0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is the best book I have ever read.  From start to finish it kept me wanting more.  The story of Charlie, with new friends Sam and Patrick was happy and sad.  It was a story with diversity, not everyone was perfect.  The book was easy to relate to.  I never wanted it to end and when it did, I cried too because I felt that the characters were leaving me too for college.  I loved the chemistry between Sam and Charlie and how they became such good friends, and Charlie just put his feelings aside.  I loved the leasons the book taught me.  It was the most powerful and meaningful book I have ever had the pleasure in reading.  It is a work of pure genious.
B000935UGM|4.0|Ryan Adams is an overblown egomaniac. Ryan Adams is an underrated musical genius. Most listeners of his music fall into those camps, and the debate lives on. But one thing cannot be denied: Adams is a very good musician, and his brand of whiskey-soaked alt-country is in good form in \\"Cold Roses.\\"<br /><br />The two-disc album not terribly new territory, with echoes of \\"Heartbreaker,\\" albeit more subdued. And as the first of three scheduled albums this year, with his new band the Cardinals, hopefully \\"Cold Roses\\" representative of what Adams is going to stick to in future. It's certainly what he's good at.<br /><br />The songs here tend towards bluesy, midtempo rock, with countryish guitars and solid drums. The Cardinals are definitely a band that suit Adams' style, and they have a comfortable feel, as if they have been playing with him a long time. Songs like the gritty country song \\"Cherry Lane\\" are among the highlights of the album. There are also some slower, softer numbers like the poignant \\"How Do You Keep Love Alive,\\" which balance out the more robust songs, and show the softer side of Adams' music.<br /><br />Like many other two-disc albums, \\"Cold Roses\\" does suffer a little from double-disc syndrome, wherein some of the songs feel like they were put in to flesh out the tracklist. Fortunately, this is restricted to only a couple of songs. The majority of songs are strong and solidly written, with a well-worn sound like that of a comfortable slipper.<br /><br />After a few years of experimentation -- through the deeply forgettable \\"Rock'N'Roll\\" and the lovely acoustic \\"Love is Hell\\" -- now Adams is back at his roots. The Cardinals are guitarists J.P. Bowersock, Cindy Cashdollar, bassist Catherine Popper, and drummer Brad Pemberton. They all do marvelously, especially since they are an experienced band, with prior work with people like Heather Nova, Hem, and past work with Adams himself.<br /><br />Adams's voice is scratchier than in his past albums, but except for a few strained vocal moments, he sounds a bit world-weary but pleasant. He also gets joined by singer-songwriter/pianist Rachael Yamagata on three songs on the second disc, playing her instrument and lending her pretty voice to Adams' older, rougher one.<br /><br />Bluesy country-rock is where Ryan Adams belongs, and he does well with his new band the Cardinals.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Now we've all seen this plotline before, Robots created by humans start killing mankind to take over the world. However don't let that scare you away from this great movie. All the characters show how they each shine in this sci-fi thriller.  <br /> <br />Will Smith stars as Del Spooner, a cop that seems to think that the robots made for humans to help with labor will somehow turn on mankind and start thinking for themselves. The only problem he has is that everyone thinks he is just being paranoid, which just proves he will be right as the movie continues.  <br /> <br />When a roboticist, a guy that designs the robots, is found killed after being tossed outside the ledge of a huge building, that is all it takes for Spooner to believe the, \\"Rise of the Machines\\" will happen. The robot being questioned denies any involvment with the doctor's death, even though he was found at the scene of the crime.  <br /> <br />Its not long before more robots start turning bad, you can tell right before they are by the red lights that flash on inside them. Spooner just somehow always seems to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, as he fends off at least a few dozen at a time when they attack, once in a freeway tunnel in a thrilling car chase that involves two trucks that have sliding doors and at least 40 robots. <br /> <br />While the acting may not be the greatest, I found that the robot, Sunny, was really good at trying to express human emotion as all he wants to do is be free and live in a quiet life. Will is good most of the time, as the tough cop who is the one that really knows what is going on as eveyone else thinks he is just stupid at times. <br /> <br />And it was the visual effects that made this worth it. The robots are great, as more and more start making an army of renegade robots. As Spooner and his partner, Susan Calvin [played by Bridget Moynahan] are on top of a huge building, trying to shut down the robots, I found it quite dizzying from seeing it at a birdseye view.  <br /> <br />Another great scene is when the robots manage to get inside the police station in the city, and the lieutenant who is always on Spooner's back fends them off with a shotgun. Great action, sounds, and vivid color all add to the suspense. <br /> <br />The big twist on who the real bad guy is in the movie is surprising [At least I thought it was] and if you are the type who likes to just watch the movie instead of trying to figure out the ending then this is great fun. I definately reccomend this movie.

B00092ZMDY|5.0|This dvd is a follow up to the Hell Freezes Over dvd and loses nothing in the 10 years since that release. <br />For those Eagles fans who want what the Eagles provide i.e. perfect reproduction of songs in concert then here you have it. <br />The best thing about the concert is the input of all of the major players. They provide examples of their own music in this concert and seem to have at last come to appreciate that each other has had a solo career and they are willing to share these songs as the Eagles. Highlights are the almost perfect renditions of most of the Eagles favourites and the harder edged sound with Jo Walsh on lead guitar. The Eagles best is interspruced with favourites from Don, Glenn and Jo. From someone who has collected their individual albums over the years it is great to hear their own songs incorporated in this concert. Great concert great sound sit back and enjoy
0743435729|4.0|In my opinion, this second book is better than On Basilisk Station. Weber seems to be more confident in his characters and his writing style. The dialogue and the story unfold at a much more natural pace and there is hardly any techno-babble (which was the biggest sore spot for me in the first book). <br />  <br />I don't read book summaries anymore (they give as much away as theatrical previews, if not more), so I had no idea what the plot was about. When it became obvious that Honor would be dealing with a backwater planet full of sexist religious fanatics, I groaned. It's become pretty standard fare for SF/Fantasy to take real world examples of religious fools and use a broad brush to paint all religious people as such. Fortunately, Weber proves to be more subtle than that and goes to great lengths to demonstrate how having misguided notions (fostered through many generations in isolation) doesn't necessarily make one a completely worthless individual. There are good men on this backwater planet who are trying to do their best according to the ways they've been taught. In fact, he even turns the tables just a tad and shows how arrogant and self-righteous those who are \\"enlightened\\" can be. He's not afraid to let his hero, Honor, make stupid decisions based on her own pride and preconceived notions. <br /> <br />Of course, this does not even touch on the overall plot, which I won't bother to summarize, but I liked it. The continuity with the first book is there but not off-putting and the characters actually appear to be changing in realistic ways. Still wouldn't rank him up with Bujold (while Weber's plotting and characterization are fine and he builds realistic characters, his use of language simply doesn't compare), but there's nothing wrong with that. He writes a good story and, ultimately, that's what counts.

0823016714|3.0|Every artist should have a facial expression book on the shelf--but maybe not this one. The most baffling deficiency of this book--and it's a biggie--is that the faces are organized by age, not emotion!! Maybe someone can convince me that a 33-year-old face differs from a 34-year-old face in displaying emotion and that should be the basis of organization in this kind of reference book. So each age-identified model gets a gallery of random mug shots which are unlabeled to emotion. Apparently the author \\"inspired\\" each model with a laundry list of emotions and they twisted their faces this-way-and-that before the camera and you can make of the results what you will. So if you need a quick facial reference for \\"thinking\\" or \\"rage,\\" for example, you have to thumb through countless pages until YOU believe you've spotted the correct visage. The author then throws in a \\"kissing gallery\\" out of the blue as the only pages on two-person interaction. (Why not a \\"fist-fight gallery\\" instead?) What maybe salvages this haphazard work is the phonemes gallery of mouth shapes from speech sounds if you're into animation. For better books on this subject, I recommended, first off, the great Stephen Roger Peck's Atlas Of Facial Expressions. Peck not only organizes his book by emotion, he elaborates on the elements that go into each facial expression. Also worthwhile is Illustrator's Reference Manual Hands & Faces which presents the material in color and from different perspectives. And you can never go wrong with Jack Hamm who covers the subject in his typically succint and understandable way in Cartooning The Head And Figure.
B000286RNY|5.0|This movie was like a dream came true, a Captain Tsubasa live! I couldn't believe how well the special effects were used to render the action sequences. Even seeing the bonuses explaining out how the effects were made up, I was still amazed.  <br />Stephen Chow really has a universal sense of humour, as well as a feeling for narrating pace, which makes the movie easy to follow. Music, acting, picture quality, everything blends into a perfect entertainment!

B0002EXH54|3.0|This is the only Megadeth reissue I did buy (with money) and I don't regret it. Along with \\"Killing Is My Business\\", this is the only new version worth buying. The drums are generally more thumping than before. Dave Mustaine cut back on the reverb but unlike \\"So Far, So Good... So What!\\" it doesn't sound that bad. The bonus tracks are quite interesting (altough you wouldn't want to listen to them again and again)... For example you can hear the chorus of \\"Peace Sells\\" as it was before the band decided the have the guitars muted.  The only thing that prevents this new version to be perfect is the god-awful mix of the title-track... The drums used to be so powerful, now you can hardly hear them.  Another complaint I have is that stupid \\"PARENTAL ADVISORY\\" sticker that's f*cking up Eddie Repka's masterpiece. Do they really think Megadeth fans are all fragile youths who need to be protected from foul language that they will learn eventually. Anyway, what else did parents expect when they saw a skeleton in front of a ruined U.N.?!  Overall, this remix is almost brilliant, but I recomend that you listen to the original mix of the title-track which is a million times better.

0805076476|5.0|This book was made for certain people. If you like violent movies and harmfull activaties you would like this book. It is about a man that cannot sleep and goes to support groups to help him sleep. He then sees Marla and can't sleep. He goes on buisness trips and meets Tyler Durden on a beach and then again on a plain. They then start fighting behind a bar and they make a fight Club. This is a American Classic!
B0002EXH5E|2.0|The \\"Risk\\" recording session went terribly wrong (nothing to do with the songs, they're great). The original producer went on to do things his own way and used all the wrong parts and the album came out nothing like what the band had intended. I suppose that's why it had such a negative impact, it sounded nothing like what Megadeth had done in the past. It had loads of interesting effects, instruments and even some electronic sequences. These ingredients made \\"Risk\\" a diverse, very rich album.  This re-release was Mustaine's chance to finally get it the way he wanted it. He got rid of all the bogus parts and reinstated the \\"proper\\" ones. But when you press play on the new version of the album and hear all the stuff that made this album interesting deleted... No more fiddles, no more tabla drums, very minimal electronic sequences, and so on... it is no longer a great album.  But did Mustaine forget that the fact that he replaced some of Marty Friedman's parts his own was one of the reasons why he quit the band? In this new mix he removed even more of Friedman's parts like the intro to \\"Insomnia\\" which he was especially fond of...  Conclusion: This was remixed to sound more Metal so it would appeal to all those who hated the original album... As a fan of the later, I don't believe that an album, that was perfect to begin with, should have been altered just to suit all those music fachists who can't accept changes. I love the original as it is, and not because it's by Megadeth like most people would say. I hope you enjoy this \\"improved\\" version.

0465011020|4.0|I have just finished reading, The Aquariums of Pyongyang by Kang Chol-Hwan. Kang Chol-Hwan is one of the first survivors of a North Korean concentration camp to tell the world his story. The author is sentenced to Yodak, a reeducation camp run by the socialist dictatorship of Kim Jong-il. The crime that Kang is punished for is that his grandfather dared to criticize the government. By the way, Kang is ten years old when he is sentenced to the camp. <br /> <br />The story tells his life growing up in the camp and the way he sees his government oppress its own citizens. He eventually escapes the oppressive socialist regime after ten years in the camp and makes his way to freedom in capitalist South Korea. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the world of politics today. It accurately portrays the path that many socialist governments follow. It also shows why we should be ever vigilant about a heavily militarized North Korea. When one understands the cold blooded ruthlessness of the North Korean socialist government, it is quite chilling to know that these crazed socialists are developing nuclear weapons with launch platforms capable of reaching the west coast of the United States.  <br /> <br />

B0009MDPYM|1.0|Pretty bad and confusing horror movie that has Keanu Reeves trying to come across as an man with a holy mission but only ends up making an fool out of himself though out the entire film with a character that has no redeeming qualities what so ever. You don't really give a damn about him or his problems and you actually want him to get hurt because he's such a jerk. The female cop (Rachel Weisz) who is following him during the course of the entire movie is a better character than he is and a much better actor as well. She's at least made me want to sit though the entire movie to see what will happen with her character while I was hoping for Keanu to get killed off in a very brutal way. Shia LaBeouf is also good and that's because he's not in the movie that much and he's not as annoying as he was in I Robot. The guy who played Papa Midnight was also good but he's not in the movie that much as well. The bad guys did not do much other than try to look menacing in all their digital glory and the pay off of the film is rather hooky. The story is good but the screenplay feels like it was rewritten several times because some of the actions of the characters seem sporadic in certain scenes of the film and the film is just way too dark to see a lot of what is going on right in front of you. The visual effects are good for what is expected and certain scenes do hold a resonance but that's really it. I hold much respect for the efforts made by Rachel Weisz, the guy who played Papa Midnight and to a lesser degree Shia LaBeouf (a little of him does go along way) But Keanu Reeves fumbles really bad in his role and let them and the audience down with a performance that will probably be a pinnacle of his career. <br /> <br /> <br />

B00007BK2N|4.0|SOMEWHAT OF A SPOILER NEAR END - The item may be common knowledge to fans of this music scene (or may not).  It is also presented pretty early in the movie but it the weight of it is not actualized until the end of the movie.  So it probably isn't really considered a spoiler, but I am giving the warning just in case.    ********    The time period was the greatest time period in underground music.  Hardcore punk and extreme metal underground was at it's strongest before degenerating into a sub-genre of pop music as it now stands.    As always happens, bridges are always being built joining popular culture and independent cultures.   The extreme music scene of the 80s unfortunately had spawned more than it's share of these musical bridge culture experiences.    Nu Wave - bridging punk and pop  Grunge - bridging punk, extreme metal and pop.  Alternative - bridging punk and pop.  The Sub-pop bands - a particularly annoying subsection of alternative.  Industrial - bridging extreme metal and pop.  Nu Metal - bridging death metal and pop.  and a whole slew of \\"edgy\\" mainstreamers such as NIN, Marilyn Manson, White Zombie.    All this watering down of genres does is to dilute it to the point that it no longer effectively exists, minimally affects pop culture, and can no longer regain its purity due to the ever dilluding association.    This movie describes itself at looking at the Manchester \\"punk\\" scene which shows how the word punk has lost every aspect of it's definition in use today.   This is alternative pop clear and simple.    This is a scene I totally despised back in the day and still hate now.  But I was surprised at how much I liked this movie.    This movie has a lot of bad reviews and I see a lot of bizaare criticisms of it.    One said it was a \\"mockumentary worse than Best in Show\\".  This is not a mockumentary.  It is a true story and quite an interesting one.    Others complained that Tony Wilson was a despicable character.  This is utter nonsense and showsthe vicious twisted values of pop culture.  Quite the opposite, this movie presents Tony Wilson as an angel of person giving entirely of himself for the sake of the music and the artists.  If this movie is an accurate portrayal of him, Tony Wilson self-destructed by his own extreme generosity and authentic love for the genre.  I still view it wasted being in the service of garbage music but this movie shows Tony Wilson of holding extreme virtue.  The total opposite of a despicable character.    This movie shows Tony Wilson falling in love with the sprouting alternative scene in Manchester and investing himself totally into it and its promotion.  It shows his creation of the Hacienda Night Club and Factory Records.      It presents this in a unique stylish manner (which probably appears similar to the Spinal Tap style confusing the other reviewer that this was a mockumentary) that actually works for the movie.  It is also one of the few movies that properly utilizes self-reference by introducing information while reminding us that it's main purpose is to tell a real story.    I didn't know the story of these events before but I assume the main points are correct.    You will see the sincerity of Tony Wilson as he gets run over by the very bands he is promoting, his many struggles, and the many unique situations in the music business.  The music exploded but Tony's mismanagement in business structure caused Factory to struggle along financial always near collapse.  For Tony it was all about the music.  He had great skill in promoting the scene but almost no skill in taking the money out of it for himself.    Finally, Factory failed and Tony would have then been able to cash in for big money by selling the entire business to other more business focused parties.  THE MILD SPOILER>  However, if the movie is correct, the only contracts Factory had with their bands was that each party had \\"the freedom to f**k off\\".  They were free to take the spoils of Wilson's labors without dealing with Wilson.    Despite hating this music scene, I recognize it is a great story of the independent do-it-yourself spirit as exhibited in the Tony Wilson character.
0793518326|5.0|The accuracy and authenticity of this collection is outstanding.  The collection is complete and will certainly help musicians re-create the Beatles' distinctive sound.  Different parts for other musical instruments are included as well as the vocals.  Tablature is also included.  This is a must have!<br /><br />Despite the complaints other reviews have made, I did not find that the print size was too small.  I also like the way the book showed which strings were being played on guitar for some of the chords for the music.<br /><br />Since NONE of the Beatles ever learned to read music, the inclusion of tabulature is most welcome.  Tabulature provides a \\"picture\\" of the guitar chord, the fret(s) and strings that are to be played.  It is an alternative method to reading music and is darned effective.  I can read music and I can read tabulature and am \\"bilingual\\" in that musical sense.  Providing both forms of musical language make this a much more inclusive work.<br /><br />If you want an outstanding, top notch book of Beatle songs with accuracy and good explanations, then you want this book.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest Rock CD's in my collection to date! I can't stop listening to them! It's the only CD's I'm playing right now, and I believe it will remain that way for a good while. <br /> The Foo Fighters finally nailed it this time around! They granted us the privledge to listen to a 2 disc CD set titled, 'IN YOUR HONOR'.  The first CD is the harder one, packed with powerful guitars, dynamic drumming and exhilarating vocals from Dave Grohl and Taylor Hawkins. They really out-did themselves on that one! <br />  <br /> The second CD is much softer, yet, not a bit boring. The second album, I believe, really shows how very talented and versatile the Foo Fighters really are, and it also happens to be my favorite of the two CD's. The lyrics are inspiring and  beautiful,as well as the melodies which are sometimes very  surreal,which is what I love!(Still, Razor, Miracle) Not one song is lacking anything.  <br /> <br />If you don't have 'IN YOUR HONOR', and you love or really like the Foo Fighters, love hard rock and ascoustic guitar  melodies, then do yourself a favor and buy this treasure! You won't regret it.

006441034X|5.0|Being one who knows only 1.05 languages, American English and a little bit of Japanese, it was difficult for me to read through the thick Brittish English that was in this book. The language and word choice tried to throw me off at times, but for the majority of the read the language made perfect sense and caused me to laugh out loud. <br /> <br />Howl's Moving Castle is an excelent novel, and I can see why Hayao Miyazaki chose to animate it, as its story fits in quite well with his other works (unexpected situations and/or twists in the story). The characters are awesome, and the description is beautiful. <br /> <br />This is a story unlike any other. I highly recommend it.

B0009XNUK0|4.0|This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo.  There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future.  But as of 2005 there are none on the market.  But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits.   So, why isn't this a 5 star package?  For one there's no \\"Dancing Machine\\", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it).  The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time.  And they included \\"Dangerous\\" a decent album cut that's not essential.  Better choice would be \\"Working Day And Night\\". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need.

0345409671|2.0|Fifty pages into the novel, I was thinking it's very much like \\"Body Thief\\" with Lestat having a stalker and obsesses with a mortal woman.  And then I was thinking Anne Rice wouldn't repeat herself and was confidence that she had something up her sleeve.  Well, the good news is that she does have something different in store for the plot.  The bad news is that what she has is mundane and now all the mysteries of the series have been irrevocably shattered! <br /> <br />One of the many elements I enjoy on the first four Vampire Chronicles is her discourse on theology.  However, she kept her views oblique and didn't try to explain anything explicitly.  She kept the proceedings mysterious and that is what novels about vampires need-a sense of mystery and the unexplainable.  Well, in this volume, Anne has the audacity (and this is not a good thing here) to unburden her views, through the voice of a character, the Devil, no less, on the mystery of life to the readers in minute details: the existence of God, the workings of heaven, the different castes of angels and supernatural beings, and even the creation of life itself is lovingly explained in dry textbook fashion.  So, Anne is a devout Catholic girl after all.  From the first few novels, I thought she might have some interesting, dare I say, heretic notion of god and religion.  Not so, it seems.  She just fleshed out the same stories that are part of the Judeo-Christian tradition.  I was bored to tears and disappointed at her lack of imagination.  Moreover, I resent that she shortchanged all the other religions since the ultimate god is very much a Christian one and if she is to tell the story of the one \\"true\\" god, she should reconcile the theology from other religions as well.  Just to be fair.   <br /> <br />I can't wait to finish this drudgery and get to the next book on Armand.  Hopefully, she had gotten it out of her system and could get back to some sensuous, exciting, and imaginative storytelling unencumberedby her religious belief.
B000148KK2|2.0|My Diana Krall collection might end with this one.  I am a big fan, but this one was a disappointment.  The songs are so slow and draggy.  After listening to some of the lyrics though, it sounds like she recently lost her mother so that could explain it.  I don't find myself reaching for this one to play again and again.  It's always a good idea to listen to something before you buy.  If you like to cry with your wine, you might go for this.

B00005JNSK|3.0|Its that time of the year again just as the summer is hurricane season its also that time of the year for hollywood to throw out its recent remakes. I must admit i had my doubts after seeing the fiasco that was Burton's Planet of the Apes but Burton proves himself in this movie and despite being a ardent fan of the origional it won me over. Its ending is sure to the please better than the original, and despite what people said about Johnny Depp's performance he was my favorite part of the movie. His Wonka was weird and socially awkward as any man who had been locked away for so long would have. In general they improved a lot, added backstory, dropped slugworth and the terrible tunnel scene but i still couldn't help myself waiting for those choice lines from the first movie by Gene Wilder that were never said in the remake. The \\"stop, wait, comeback\\", \\"no i won't hold you responsible\\" and \\"you stole fizzy lifting drinks!\\" which goes to show the strength of the original and the hold which Gene Wilder had over the movie and the story.  <br /> <br />All in all it wasnt bad and will please most people, however if they could just get rid of those dreadful oompa loompa songs....
B000002LTU|2.0|Man, I had no idea music still sounded like this. This sounds like it comes straight from 1985. You know, I admire Miles. He's a great musician, and there ain't nothing me, or anybody is going to say that is going to change that. But after he turned to fusion, it sounds like he wanted to be hip with the popular crowd much more than he wanted to show off his music talent to people that actually cared. You see, the general pop audience doesn't care about complex harmonic changes, odd time meters, complex rhythms, new things. Whatever's in is in and what's out, well........ <br /> <br />Even though I'm not a fan of his later stuff, (post 1975) I still admire him for his early days with Bird, Dizz, Trane, and Cannonball, but I also admire the fact that he went his own way, even though that way was trajic, for us listeners who really appreciated his music.  <br /> <br />Well was it worth it? 80's pop music is now over, but somehow classic 50's and 60's jazz classics are still being enjoyed. Did Miles really gain the success he wanted? Well, if he were alive maybe he would be playing death metal. Or gansta rap, who knows...
B000001FS3|5.0|JT is my favorite U2 album for many reasons, but mostly because it sounds totally different every time I listen to it. It is a statement about the band's mastery of their craft that even relatively simple songs like \\"Trip through your wires\\" and \\"Red Hill town\\", being the most straightforward songs on JT, reveal new sounds, connections and melodies each time I hear them. Of course, the lion's share of praise for this CD has gone to the three absolute blockbusters, \\"With or Without You\\", I Still Haven't Found...\\" and \\"Bullet...\\", but they are only three of the eleven powerful, gripping songs here. My personal favorites on the CD are \\"One Tree Hill\\", \\"With...\\" and \\"Red Hill...\\". Somehow the song I like least is \\"In God's Country\\" - maybe it is just TOO MUCH Edge going on... but it is still a better song than most other band's highlights. All this to say that JT is very enduring, very engaging and not a bit worn out. Bono has recently become something of a caricature of himself, but 18 years ago (!!!!) when JT came out he was hitting the stride that gave us two of the most visceral, emotional albums in rock... JT and Achtung Baby. U2 took the emotiveness of Bruce Springsteen and married it to a driving, thoroughly modern musical powertrip on JT... and it still sounds incredible.

B00070Q7VO|4.0|Apparently, a Boston cabbie sees and hears lots of things.  One night, picking up a fare outside the Wang Theater, some women (of varied ages) got in and announced that they were wearing no longer wearing their panties. The reason?  They had tossed them up on the stage adorned by Canadian sensation Michael Buble.<br /><br />I heard this story on a recent trip to Boston, where I also heard this CD.  Buble, I was told, is a dynamic and sexy singer, and he's got the everyman good looks and the stage moves (he's great with a microphone) to whip his public into a frenzy.  His repetoire reflects a penchant for standards, old and new, and some experimentation.  Buble is described sometimes as \\"middle of the road\\" and \\"smooth jazz,\\" but I think he's more  inventive and talented than those words imply to the jazz fan.  This is a guy whose grandfather encouraged him to listen to vocalists of the 1940's and 1950's, and on his better songs this tradition is evident.  His New York debut was in 2003 at the jazz-oriented Blue Note club, but he's been successful in more pop-oriented venues as well, notablyy in movies and TV.<br /><br />Buble's choice (and most singers probably wish they had this problem) is whether to lean more towards jazz or pop, or to stray towards some flashy jazz/pop commercial fusion that fails his early promise.  On his best songs his clear strong voice radiates superb phrasing and inventive dynamics--reigning in his vocal when you expect a punch (e.g., the dynamics on \\"You Don't Know Me By Now\\"). He gives a heartfelt performance on \\"A Foggy Day (in London Town),\\" and surprises with his rhythm and tone. Despite the frequent comparisons to Frank Sinatra and arranger Nelson Riddle, only \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" uses Riddle's score.  It's a tribute, not an impersonation.  He can sound like Sinatra at times, but it's not a slavish devotion. To me, the album's highlight is \\"The More I Want You,\\" he tells the story with believable emotion, not just relying on that freshly groomed voice.<br /><br />Yet, Buble clearly goes for some easy (some might say cheap) home runs, most notably on the undistinguished (except for the trumpet) \\"Song For You,\\" and the crowd pleasing \\"Latin\\" rhythms injected into \\"Save the Last Dance For Me.\\" There's also the obligatory duet, \\"Quando.\\"  The latter is pleasant enough, he and Furtado curve around each other's voices, but a listener won't develop a longterm romance with it. Similarly, on the opening \\"Feelin' Good,\\" he does a faithful reproduction of a brassy Las Vegas crowd pleaser, but its appeal is limited--you appreciate that he knows the tricks, but he's not adding much new.<br /><br />However, Buble's talent and musical savvy is just too deep, because he also hits you with interesting versions of \\"Can't Buy Me Love,\\" playing with the tempo, and \\"How Sweet It Is,\\" where his nicely messy voice mixes it up with some startlingly fresh blues guitar, harmonica, and organ. Although his one original number is somewhat disappointing, Buble's musicianship, originality, and appreciation of the total sound blow away most of his competition. He knows enough to let the instruments stand out, and his accompaniment is excellent, especially on bass and the trumpet and guitar solos. Overall, the youthful Mr. Buble has too much of a young man's voice; the timbre and shadings haven't had enough cooking time yet; however, this heartthrob has the potential for a longterm musical relationship, not just a one-night fling.oomed voice.

B0009XNUK0|2.0|I gave this album 2 stars not for lack of how brilliant all the music is on this compilation, but the fact that this is how many Gr. hits albums now? We first get HIStory, thin the first disk alone, then the #1's then the box set and now this. They are all great songs, but in this day with online downloading and so many previous \\"hits\\" albums in the can what do they expect out of us. Anybody that is a fan of MJ's music already has whatever songs they want already, and if they are new fans they are just going to download them anyway. It is no longer a market for Gr. Hits albums, when an artists entire library is available at the click of a button. Besides who doesn't own billie jean somewhere on some form in there collection. Hey MJ why don't you put some new material out, that I might think about buying.
B00006AUIG|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in many.   The director tries to actually create something never done before (as far as I can tell) and succeeds marvelously.  The tension builds from the beginning...and builds and builds and then the climax is kaboom!  Satisfying, intelligent.  What more could you want from this type of movie?  PLUS it has little teasers, nifty little contrasts and not a few red-herrings to keep your mind wondering.  Most movies lay it out in dumbed-down focused detail so you couldn't possibly miss the point. Session 9 is art.
6305181810|5.0|This is a great movie!   Matt Damon is so great in this part of a Southern Lawyer starting out, and Mickey Rourke and Danny Devito are perfectly cast as the supporting partners to Matt's role.    I love this movie and have already watched it over and over.     A must see.
B000053V7Q|5.0|This is in my opinion the best dvd available of the King of Rock'n'Roll : Elvis Presley. All shows were filmed during his 3rd Las Vegas season in August 1970 at the International Showroom. This is absolutely wonderful work from the world's greatest entertainer. <br /> <br />The second edition won't show the talking fans anymore, only Elvis. You'll see Elvis rehearsing in Culver City with the TCB band, and then the show will start in Las Vegas. Nothing but powerfull rock'n'roll songs, classics and new ballads. <br /> <br />The show is digital remastered, which makes you wonder if it was yesterday instead of 35 years ago. 5 stars for this dvd. Even if you're not a fan, you will be one after seeing That's The Way It Is SE. <br /> <br />Sven Vandermaas <br />

B00092ZMDY|5.0|Since seeing the Eagles live on the Columbia River in Washington in 2002, I have hoped for a DVD release of their concert.  This is definitely a quality recording, with great interviews from the band.  The video and audio are very well done, they have mellowed with age a bit, but, still put on a close to perfection performance.  Includes a couple of new tunes to enjoy as well.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This is an excellent album!  Many here have given very intelligent reviews of this wonderful work, but I thought I would add my voice to those proclaiming this a valuable piece of prog-rock history.  The opening track 'Going for the One' hits pretty strongly right out of the gate, although a bit raucous at times, it still conveys a positive message through its lyrics.  Parallels is another favorite, I heard the live version of this song long before the studio version, and let me say that the studio version is superior, the addition of the church organ adds the missing element, Wakeman just plain rocks!  Wonderous Stories is a classic, and Awaken is purely outstanding, and my favorite track off the album.  It moves from more rocking segments 'Gentle, Mass, Touch' to the light airy passages, to the powerful conclusion.  I would agree with those who've said this may not make a good 'First' Yes album.  Close to the Edge gets that vote, but this one is definitely not to be missed.  A great album!  Outstanding!
B0002O0CM0|5.0|I remember reading some reviews for other Doors CDs a while back, and one of them made a reference to these two albums that the Doors recorded after the death of lead singer Jim Morrison.  So I was naturally curious to see what that would sound like.  I bought the CD expecting to be let down, but after listening to it I feel just the opposite emotion.  The other three can do just fine on their own, with songs like \\"In The Eye of the Sun\\" and \\"Variety is the Spice of Life.\\"  My attitude toward this CD is similar to my attitude toward the Who continuing to tour with two of their members missing.  No it will never be the same, but that in no way means it's bad.
B000002ITM|5.0|I was given this album a couple of years ago (in 2001) and at first I only really listened to a few tracks. I didn't really appreciate Testament at first, but after some time and maturing in my \\"Metal Ear,\\" I really got into these guys; and man is \\"The Ritual\\" a brilliant CD...<br /><br />Although recorded in 1992, this album has a strongly classical 80's Metal sound. The production is very good and well produced, but not overproduced. The production creates a wonderful synthesis of sound that really allows all the instruments and vocals to be heard clearly and no single element overpowers another except when needed i.e solos. Speaking of solos, Hot Damn! Some solos on this album like on \\"So Many Lies,\\" are so enthralling and ghostly as a sound sample of a priest preaches under the piercing guitar solo. The riff on this song is also really impressive and carries the song along its dark path. \\"Agony,\\" was one of the very first songs I immediately loved on this album. Fast but not too fast, this song kicks some serious ass! The lyrics totally rip and the instruments play in perfect unison.<br /><br />Altogether the album is a really solid, strong offering from Testament. Some songs are much slower and paced like \\"The Ritual,\\" (the song, not the album) which is dark, haunting and foreboding and echoes all the traits of true classical Metal. \\"Return To Serenity,\\" is also a much slower song that seems alot sadder and introspective, but still has killer riffs and beautiful, resonating guitar parts. The vocals are also deep and penetrating, and the drums keep the overall rhythm and feeling of the song through a rather simple yet effective beat. This album offers quite alot of diversity and covers a number of topics like religious beliefs, pain, sadness, loneliness and life after death.<br /><br />What keeps this album so interesting is the various paces, effects used (i.e a flanger with distortion is used in \\"The Sermon,\\" which brings waves of tension and anxiety to the song) and extensive topics covered by the band. In fact, \\"The Ritual,\\" is far from ritualistic and offers a fresh, unique topic on every single track. The guitar sounds are tight and well created, the drums pound, keep rhythm and guide the songs and the lyrics growl, move and keep you interested.<br /><br />\\"The Ritual,\\" is a fantastic, amazing and impressive album. I strongly recommend it for fans of classic Heavy Metal as well as newer Metallers. If you enjoy diversity, complexity, pain, anguish, sadness and beauty, \\"The Ritual,\\" will definitely keep you entertained and enthralled...covered by the band.

B0009I7NNA|5.0|I really can't understand how anyone can say Avenged Sevenfold is done. While I am a big fan of today's metal and classic, I have to admit I'm drawn more to the retro rock (and I'm only 18, so it's not just me longing for the old days). A7X has always been great at blending modern and classic metal, and this CD proves it.<br /><br />I have to admit that the first time I listened to City Of Evil, I really couldn't wait for it to be over so I could go back to listening to Waking The Fallen. But after a second play-through, I realized that the music on this CD is amazing. Strength Of The World has to be the best A7X song I have heard (except for I Won't See You Tonight Part 1, of course), and yes kiddies, I have all three CDs. The Wicked End has the best orchestral interlude of any metal/orchestra blend that I've heard.<br /><br />While initially disappointed by the fact that there is no screaming except in the beginning of a couple songs, I came to realize that it only allows Shadows to be even more emotionally involved in his singing.<br /><br />All in all, Avenged Sevenfold still has it goin' on. All three CDs have shown their endless supply of talent, each in different ways. And I commend them for not caring what the closed minds and critics would think about this album.
0312323859|5.0|I enjoyed Giffin's previous novel so much that I thought Something Blue couldn't live up to it. In fact, it may have surpassed the prequel. <br /> <br />Something Blue picks up where Something Borrowed left off. Darcy has discovered her best friend and her fiance together, and storms off in a huff. When her relationship with her ex-fiance's roommate peters out, she finds herself pregnant and alone, with no real friends. <br /> <br />Determined to make a fresh start, Darcy cajoles Ethan (her fifth-grade boyfriend) into letting her stay with him in London. He is reluctant, but agrees. <br /> <br />What follows is a personal journey, bumpy and engaging, as Darcy evolves from an extremely self-centered person into someone who can take part in a real relationship. The book, like its predecessor, is deeper than the pink and blue covers imply. <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.

B00070DK14|3.0|I've seen all the very positive reviews for this album and I'm afraid I'm going to have to be in the minority when I say that I'm not terribly fond of this album and think that it's a bit overrated, especially by Ian Anderson himself. I really liked the previous album, \\" A \\". Yes, it was somewhat of a departure from the traditional Jethro Tull sound, but I thought it was an exciting and dynamic departure and very welcome, in my opinion. Very heavy and progressive and electronic. I also thought it was cool that Eddie Jobson was in the group, especially since I was a big U.K. fan.<br /><br />So what happened on \\" Broadsword and the Beast \\"? Looks like Anderson and company tried to both take a step back and take a step forward at the same time and other than four tracks that I really love, I would say it did not work.<br /><br />Broadsword certainly SOUNDS more like a traditional Tull album than \\" A \\", with the return of more rustic and acoustic instruments like mandolin and a bit more acoustic guitar and flute. This is probably due to the fact that the songs on Broadsword were written for a Jethro Tull album, while the tracks for \\" A \\" were written for a possible Ian Anderson solo album. Anderson had let his hair grow back ( and how!), so he was looking more like his younger self. Broadsword, with it's cartoon front and back cover, certainly LOOKS more like a traditional Tull album, too. And, alas, these are some of my problems with the album. I almost feel Tull became caricature's of themselves on this, CARTOON caricatures, in reference to the cover. I think they should have either stuck with the progressive, electronic rock of  \\" A \\", or gone back to a more traditional hard rock sound.<br /><br />My other main gripe? The songs themselves. Of the ten songs found on the original album, I only liked ( or loved) four of them. Those songs include the opening track, \\" Beastie \\", which has some very dangerous sounding synthesizers at the beginning and great lyrics and singing from Anderson. My favorite song is \\" Slow Marching Band \\", which was the last in a trio of wonderful, heartfelt ballads from Anderson, which began with \\" Home \\" from Stormwatch and continued with \\" And Further On \\" from A. I particularly love the refrain for  \\" Slow Marching Band \\". It also showed that while Anderson's voice was getting a bit weaker and more stratchy, he could still sing them acoustic guitar songs and the ballads. My only gripe about this wonderful sad, melodic song is the cliched drum entrance on the bridge. \\" Broadsword \\", which may be the heaviest tune on the album (or maybe not) is also quite enjoyable, with it's slight Indian style drum beat and them beautiful sounding synthesizers. I also really like \\" Seal Driver \\" for some reason. It rocks out a bit, gets a bit jazzy in the middle, probably one of the more tuneful and at the same time most progressive numbers on the album.<br /><br />I really don't care for the other six songs on this, unfortunately. As a an anti-matter of fact (or fiction), this was the first Tull album since either Songs From The Wood or Too Old To Rock-n-Roll that contained a song or two that I outright HATE! The song on Broadsword that gets that vote is \\" Watching Me Watching You \\". It's a stupid, little electronic piece with some ridiculous lyrics and even more ridiculous singing. IT'S RIDICULOUS, I TELL YOU! With it's heavy reliance on drum machines and synthesizers, it was also an indication of the musical path Tull would follow on their next album. And \\" Cheerio \\"....what a weak, closing track. At least it's the shortest song here.<br /><br /> I must say that I DO like the sound of the synthesizers and I like the fact that guitarist Martin Barre is heard from more on this. And I DO like the front and back cover, by the way.<br /><br />The remastered version comes with two pages of liner notes from Ian Anderson and eight bonus tracks. Contrary to what it says on the CD wrap, these eight songs are not ' previouslyunreleased ' ; they stopped being previously unreleased when they first appeared on the 20 Years Of Jethro Tull Boxed Set back in 1988. Nevertheless, their inclusion here makes perfect sense, since they were recorded during the sessions for Broadsword. While none of these eight songs are not that bad ( I actually think they are better than some of the songs that originally MADE the album), they are nothing very special, either. Perhaps they catch on after a few listens.<br /><br />So, as I said in the opening paragraph, I guess I'm in the minority here in my opinion of the album, which nonetheless I'm sure will appeal to some Tull fans.nreleased when they first appeared on the 20 Years Of Jethro Tull Boxed Set back in 1988.

So it seems appropriate that Mule Variations has traces of warmth and family all over it. The sad lament of House Where Nobody Lives. The dusty, tired reflections of Pony. The tender crooning on Picture in a Frame. The bittersweet ruminations in Georgia Lee. The unbelievable sweetness that makes up Take it with Me and the reassuring phrases of Come on Up to the House. Waits and his co-writer/wife Kathleen Brennan fashion exquisite tales of loneliness, loss, redemption, and deep love.     In addition to doing that well, they can also turn out stuff that's all dirty and bluesy (Get Behind the Mule, Cold Water) funny and clever (Big in Japan, Chocolate Jesus), downright odd (Lowside of the Road, Eyeball Kid), or dream-like and totally eerie (Black Market Baby).  What's He Building? and Filipino Box Spring Hog were penned by Waits alone - the former being a cryptic, clanging spoken-word poem and the latter being just completely outrageous (did the title give it away?) And of course, the voice. Whether it be a low, scratchy growl or insane, crazed shouting, the singing fluctuates wildly from song to song.    It's a schizophrenic collection (the sequence is strange and great - an abundance of stomp and noise is immediately followed by a soft ballad), dominated by piano, guitar, percussion, harmonica, sax, trumpet, even turntables. The musicians are fantastic (Marc Ribot, Greg Cohen, Ralph Carney, Smokey Hormel, Les Claypool, Charlie Musselwhite, Larry Taylor, John Hammond, etc). The album has a weary, \\"home-y\\" feel to it; wise and vulnerable and very, very endearing. Tom is amazing and Mule Variations is plain beautiful!
B000002GYN|4.0|In 1972 Glenn Frey and Don Henley's band The Eagles released their debut album, simply self-titled, The Eagles. While the bands debut may not have legendary status as some of their feature albums do or the great claim that other debut albums by Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith have but this isnt a bad album either! No I dont pull out this one and listen to it as much as I do One Of These Nights or The Long Run, but this is still a good listen every once in a while.<br /><br />The album features some of the bands biggest and best hits, The Jackson Brown co-written gem 'Take It Easy' apears here, the slower 'Peaceful Easy Fellin' also arose on this album, as well as the rocker 'Whitchy Woman' which I think is one of the bands all time best songs.<br /><br />But this is a album of more then just a few hit singles. With 'Take It Easy' opening the album and 'Whitchy Woman' following your set for a great album, or so you'd think. 'Chug All Night' while very catchy and a decent song, can get old and worn out after a while. While The Eagles usualy made beautiful ballads on this album they obvously hadnt found thei nitch as ballader's. 'Most Of Us Are Sad' is a decent ballad but nothing like the band was capable of. 'Nightingale' is a good little rocker featuring that signature harmonic vocals we came to love from the band, while 'Train Leaves Here This Morning' is a nice little country flavored song bidding farewell to a lover. Next is what has to be my favorite song on the album, 'Take The Devil.' It is  simply one of the best songs the band has ever written and recorded! The whole general feel of the songs is amazing, and everything I love about this band can be sumed up in 'Take The Devil!' 'Early Bird' is another little country-rocker with good guitar and selfreflective lyrics. 'Peaceful Easy Feeling' was never one of my favorite Eagles songs but on a hot summer day it can be the perfect song! The album ends with 'Tryin' which is a cool song to end the album with and really the best song to have ended the album, they song leaves you wanting more and was a sign of things to come from the band.<br /><br />All in all this is a pretty good album, not classic or essential by any means but still good. Glen Frey and Don Henleys song written and vocals are great here. But what has always been my favorite thing about The Eagles is the guitar playing, the band has always featured great guitar playing, and it's not in short supply. So to all country fans, I would recomend this album, as well as to all Eagles fans, Casual or Diehard.

B00092ZL80|5.0|During the EWF set, Philip Bailey asks the audience how many have been with them for the 30 years they've been around. Well, I was into them before then, back when pretty much only R&B or FM college stations played them, and later on watching Verdine 'levitate' onstage, so I guess I've seen and heard enough of them to know that they aren't fakin' the funk 30+ years later. <br /> <br />Also, thanks to an extremely hip, musically adventurous young deejay on Detroit R&B radio in the late '60s/early '70s (Donnie Simpson, who went on to become instrumental in the formation of BET), I became an avid fan of Chicago's early music. The arrangements and the horns just blew me away, and Robert Lamm could sing to me anytime he wanted to.  <br /> <br />Putting these two bands together on the tour stage was a stroke of genius. While both individual sets were very good (the music was extremely tight, the instrumental solos were killer, especially Walt Parazaider's flute on \\"Just You and Me,\\" and the vocals were, for the most part, on track (some age was showing -- but isn't that to be expected?). Robert Lamm is STILL in great voice, and Philip's range is still quite remarkable. As a diehard EWF fan, I selfishly would have liked more of their lesser known hits included, but I realize that this was a joint concert. <br /> <br />The opening and the finale, however, are worth the price of either the live ticket or the DVD. In the finale, six amazing songs (\\"September,\\" \\"Free,\\" \\"Singasong,\\" \\"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is,\\" \\"Shining Star,\\" and \\"25 or 6 to 4\\") seamlessly woven in one right after the other, with the only real break in music being after \\"Shining Star,\\" as the crowd is screaming for more. They aren't disappointed... \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" totally rocks the entire house! You would think these guys had played this music together for decades. They did not play as two awesome bands, but as one band that NOBODY could touch! They seem to really feed off of one another, and looked like they loved every second of it! <br /> <br />My kids range in age from 21 to 4, and they play this DVD as much as I do!

It is subtitled but the story is easy to follow without reading the subtitles.

B0001GH7KY|4.0|House By The Cemetery is another fine film that is often missed among horror lovers. While it's not a masterpiece, it is a very satisfying killer flick.<br /><br />Trimming down the movie's plot to it's essentials, HBTC presents the story of the horrifying legend of a man, Dr. Freudstein, who has been living in the basement of a creepy house for many years -- surviving off of the cells of living humans he captures. The Boyle family, who've just moved into the house, are the most recent unlucky bunch to meet the zombie Doctor and face his diabolical intentions. Will they escape? Or will they just become a few more bodies in Freudstein's mass grave of a laboratory?<br /><br />Fulci attempts to throw in a little \\"twist\\" for the ending, and I suppose he succeeds, even though I, for one, was a little confused by the ending. It seems interesting, but the meaning of it is not too clear. Nonetheless, you can be assured that even if you miss any underlying cleverness, you should still be able to enjoy this good old-fashioned piece of horror. The only complaint I have is of the english overdubs. I warn you: the vocal actors are horrible. But hopefully you can ignore it and only use it as hate for the victims. Mwahahahaha...
B00005M91K|4.0|I think Ron Fricke accomplishes exactly what he set out to do:  to let places and people in places speak for themselves without having to say anything.  This movie easily opens up the mystery and wonder of so many of the things we take for granted, or that have become \\"mundane\\" during the course of our life.  I recommend this movie to anyone.  Drawback...sometimes, for me, I have to be in the right mood to watch it because of it's level of intensity.  It isn't like popping in \\"Ace Ventura\\" and letting yourself go brain dead for 90 minutes!  An awesome piece of work.

Will her lies catch up with her? Will the life she strived for from a young age, law, call her back to London? The book was not too predictable, which I really liked. The narrative was good, and I really got into the storyline and hoped Samantha made the right decisions in the end.
0783230079|5.0|this movie has been a favorite of mine since I first saw it at the theater.  Robert Downey Jr is great in this movie, as well as Elizabeth Shue and others.  Great storyline.  Just loved it.
B0002234LS|5.0|Do any of you recall when Johnny Depp was on 21 Jump Street?  All refined, and cute, playing cops and robbers.  Seriously, I didn't think Depp had distance downward.  Sure a handsome face that you would like in whichever peculiar film he was featured in.<br /><br />Obviously, I misjudged the packaging.<br /><br />Mort Rainey, a writer struggling for an idea, suggestions- something to help him get the keys clicking on his lap top.  As he naps in his tattered robe, with his wild hair Mort revisits his wife and her adultery.<br /><br />Mort is accosted by John Shooter, he's alleging that Mort is a plagiarist.  He gives Mort the story he's written with his ending, and challenges Mort to prove who wrote which story first.  Then demands that his ending is to be written, and published.<br /><br />If that isn't bad enough Mort has trouble hiding the fact that he's dealing with a painful divorce.  Can he alleviate the pressure by refuting Shooter's claims?<br /><br />I'll admit, for a minute I was shook.  As we watched this film the obvious didn't seem to fit, and just as I started to put the puzzle together the movie ran its course.  The intensity alone keeps you guessing.
B000002H6C|4.0|...And Justice For All is one of the greatest metal albums ever made.It has superb fierce guitar play,smashing drums and great lyrics.Songs like Blackened,the title song and To Live is to Die are all brilliant metal tracks to which the latter one is almost like a metal symphony.It starts off with a riff that ressembles the riff of Nothing Else Matters and then goes into metal overdrive for about 8 minutes and finally returns back to the quiet riff. <br /> <br />Still,the true classic on this album is of course One,an epic anti war piece that combines great lyrics,beautiful metal melodies and a striking heavy finale.One alone makes this a historical metal album,but the other songs are also of high quality. <br /> <br />A must have for every metal fan or music fan for that matter.
B00004THAY|5.0|since the first time i listened to this album it has been in heavy rotation.  the guitar work is consistently impressive throughout and is understated in that it is more about flawless execution, inflection and tone than it is about blistering and technically challenging solos.  it is also the best collaboration of two such peers, both axemen and both estemeed vocalists, both parties do what they do best and serve as complements vs. substitutes or competitors to one other.  i enjoy trying to figure out what guitar parts are being played by who and i can almost see BBs hand working his famous butterfly tremolo.  this album is pure, clean, pristine and hard driving blues by a couple of the Kings. <br /> <br />Guy Smiley signing off
B000002ACR|3.0|Mixing several musical styles this is quite a good record.Standouts like Have You Seen Her Face,C.T.A. 102 and Mind Gardens make it a satisfying record.Maybe not top of the bill,but The Byrds were never my favorite band of that era.Still,these songs outclass Turn Turn Turn which I've heard too many times. <br /> <br />Listen to C.T.A. 102 especially,a great track with quite a brilliant psychedelic mid section and a freaky ending with an \\"alien\\" talking to us.There's also a pretty good cover of Dylan's song My Back Pages.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Sure, this isn't The Fragile, it's not The Downward Spiral, it's not a lot of things. But you just appreciate the songs on this CD, it's still a great work from El Rezzo. <br /> <br />I've heard pretty much every NIN song, excluding a few remixes, and I can safely that With Teeth is still a damn good record. There's familiar strains coming through from previous works - as everybody as pointed out - the piano-tinkling of The Fragile puts in an appearance at the end, for example. But Only, for example, is something new to NIN. It's pretty much unabashed disco, and the closest we've ever seen to that was something from the PHM era. It's also the first spoken word-ish thing since Down In It, which wasn't a shining star in Reznor's song library. <br />I have to dock points simply because WT hasn't got the same perfectionist skill as Reznor's previous releases. But then again, that's not what he was aiming for. So I rate for sheer quality of song, for catchiness, and for energy.  <br /> <br />Give the man credit - he's 40 now, and still making industrial anger-anthems. That's quite something.
B000002UAU|3.0|No doubt about the relevance and importance of this Beatles record,but it's not the greatest album ever made.Still,it is a very good album with some beautiful songs.The Lennon songs(written by the man himself)are the greatest songs.Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds(the LSD song)is truly stunning as is Day in the Life.My favorite song is Within or Without You with that Sitar sound,which came from the Beatles trip to Sitar legend Ravi Shankar.The McCartney songs are not even close to the Lennon tracks since they are pretty cheezy and not experimental. <br /> <br />Important,very important,but not a masterpiece.It is also not a typical Beatles record,cause if you listen to their best of records(I've got the album 1)not a single Sgt. Pepper song is included.Not that that's a problem though.For Beatles starters I would recommend the great 1 album that shows a more recognisable Beatles sound.
0060594888|5.0|This book is not your typical \\"self-help\\" \\"how to get rich quick\\" type of read. Rather it is a blueprint of how to add purpose, meaning, and direction to your life so that you might \\"get from where you are to where you want to be.\\"<br /><br />Ralph Waldo Emerson once said that the \\"masses of men lead lives of quiet despairation,\\" and it is because \\"where there is no vision, the people perish.\\" In order to experience success, one must understand the principles of success. In order to understand the principles of success, one must learn them from one who has experienced success, as well as failure.<br /><br />The appeal of this book is that it is simple, yet not simplistic; it is common-sense, yet not common, that is not trite. Jack Canfield draws from a diverse wellspring of sources, personal experiences, and knowledge basis to illustrate that whatever you define as success, if you the reader want to experience this success, you can. \\"The Principles always work, if you work the principles.\\"<br /><br />This book is not a book one will read, then go on ones merry way to live happily ever after. This book is more like a \\"pocket consultant;\\" I have found myself referring to various chapters in this book on an as needed basis and will continue to do so as the wisdom contained therin is truly timeless.<br /><br />Mr. Canfield has given humankind a gift and this book makes a great gift to oneself, or to anyone you feel could use affirmation.<br /><br />A truly life-impacting read in every sense of the word.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|This record is a superb glance at The Beatles.Sure,a lot of songs are missing(these are number 1's)since for instance not a single Sgt. Pepper song is included,but that doesn't make it a bad record at all.The first 16 songs are the greatest,all of very high quality(Paperback Writer,Yesterday,Eleanor Rigby to name a few)but then it slightly falls apart.I don't like the late Beatles era with(my taste)bad songs like Let It Be,All You Need Is Love,Long and Winding Road. <br /> <br />Still,only the first 16 songs alone make it a good buy.Great Rock 'n Roll songs for everyone to love!
0671004107|3.0|This book has good ideas and characters as well as a nuanced story, but for some reason I just didn't think it was all that good.  I liked Ellie, the chief protagonist, who was psychologically complex and a striver for discovery - she had a funny relationship with her father and step father, which influenced her ability to get close to men, perhaps focusing her on the search for intelligent life.  Of course, she makes a great discovery and then fights the bureaucracy to get a chance to travel to the new beings with the technology that they transmit.  Then of course there is the journey and the disappointing reactions of mankind, etc.  THis is a solid and believable plot.<br /><br />That is fine so far as it goes.  Somehow, it just felt static to me, rather than pulsing with the life that a novel by Octavia Butler or even Frank Herbert does.  Perhaps it is because I regard the best hard scifi as genuinely great novels that I found this so mediocre.  The characters are more vehicles for ideas than living beings, perhaps, or they just weren't all that interesting outside of their amazing adventure.<br /><br />Tepidly recommended.  Go elsewhere for great hard scifi.
B000059MEK|3.0|Discovery has some really fine moments:Digital Love(probably their best track),Nightvision,Superheroes and High Life show Daft Punk at their creative best.The big hit One More Time is of course also very good,a true sing along. <br /> <br />But there are some tracks that are kind of a waste.Crescendolls,Face to Face and Too Long are just not good enough.Too Long is of course funny when you hear it the first time but it gets annoying after that. <br /> <br />Still,an above average dance album.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie speaks for itself, I've never understood why the cover is loaded with so much ridiculous hype. Easily one of the best movies ever made. And made with an exceptionally limited budget too!
B000024KBA|3.0|The Madcap Laughs is a sad record really,since it was made by one of the greatest musicians in rock history but it was made in a time when the musician was already in Section 8.Syd Barrett's solo record has some great moments though.Terrapin, No Good Trying and Octopus are all songs that typify the great ex-Pink Floyd front man.Weird lyrics, strange musical loops and surprising twists.The greatest on the album is a slow song though.Golden Hair is a true masterpiece and it is almost a shame that it only lasts 2 minutes.Anyway,the rest can't compete and that makes it a must have for every Floyd/Barrett fan(which I am)but for everybody else I would suggest The Floyd's debut Piper At the Gates of Dawn which has Syd's autograph written all over it.
1932100385|5.0|This is probably the BEST nutrition book that I have ever read.  Prof. Campbell has distilled a 35-year career in nutritional research, governmental advisory boards, expert panels, epidemiological study and survey into a readable, cogent and clear statement on the root causes of most of the chronic and degenerative diseases that we suffer from.  He lives what he preaches, and is healthy and active at age 70, running 6-8 miles a day.   <br />In extremely careful and thorough research, Campbell has proved that he can turn the growth of cancerous tumors on and off simply by altering the nutrients he feeds his subjects. <br />If you have any thought of keeping yourself healthy simply by changing your lifestyle, this is the book to read.  Campbell backs up his assertions with careful and thorough scientific and epidemiological data gathered around the world by many scientists over the course of decades.  I hope this becomes a best-seller! <br />
