B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was so good. I can't wait for the next one to come out. I can't decide  if this was better than fifty shades or grey or not. I'm thinking right now that it is.
B00005ABTT|4.0|This went well with the rest of our collection that i bought my husband for xmas this year thank you

B0082RX1P4|5.0|I didn't think I really needed to read this book because I had read The Zappos Experience earlier in the year. That book did such a great job describing the culture of Zappos and how it was created that I wondered what more this book could add.<br /><br />The short answer: A great deal.<br /><br />The long answer: The Zappos Experience concentrates on the concepts and ideas implemented at Zappos which created the culture and success there. Delivering Happiness talks about Tony Hsieh's journey and why what he created at Zappos is important to him. Most importantly, Tony Hsieh is open about the challenges and failures he experienced on his life path.<br /><br />As an entrepreneur, I found this book to be inspirational. It places the many challenges I face on a daily basis into perspective. As a values based consultant, facilitator and small business mentor, I found proof that the things I talk about make companies stronger and more profitable in the long run.<br /><br />Finally, let me share with you that this book is an enjoyable, and quick read that is filled with many great ideas. However, they are not mainstream. As Tony Hsieh says in the preface, this book is for those \\"who want to defy conventional wisdom and create their own paths to success.\\"<br /><br />Karen L. Jett, CMA<br />Creator and Facilitator of Strategic Plan-ting(TM) Workshops
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I started reading the series about a month ago. I got sucked into them first as anyone else who read them did. I think these books are purely perfection. With each page a new emotion overcomes you and that's something of amazement. The books are my absolute favorites. I can't wait for the next movie to come out yet I know that they won't even touch the books.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|I played and beat World of Goo years ago on the PC and not only is it an excellent and very fun game in general, but this port keeps most of that intact. I do have problems sometimes picking a specific goo ball, but I think that's because this port was probably primarily made for screens larger than the 4&quot; screen of my phone. I feel like this would have to be amazing on the larger screen of a tablet. Still though, no slowdown at all and everything looks great.<br /><br />That said, my one real complaint is about the (admittedly pretty great) sound. Everything sounds great and there's a wonderful soundtrack, but every app should have a mute option. I shouldn't have to turn down my phone's volume manually every time I enter the app and turn it back up whenever I leave. So one star down there.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|THIS WAS SUCH  A GOOD BOOK! I had heard the great reviews, but never bought it. When it finally went on sale I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! I read this book all today,  laughing, tearing up, and relating to it. I would recommend it to all of my friends. You so won't regret this buy!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very interesting report on Dr. Alexander's experiences. While we may see things differently this is a valuable account on what we all will enjoy sometime.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I mean it's a dictionary and very informative. There's really not much I can say about it.  I guess I approve.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My son love it nice game lots of fun, keep him busy all the time, is different and the part that he have to draw the hero and his friend is awesome more games like this please
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing I absolutely love them. Thank you so much for writing these amazing books. I can't wait to see the movie even though it's never as good as the books
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Strong vocals all around for the exception of Russel Crowe, who seems a little thin for a booming tenor that usually fills Javert's role.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Having heard great things from others about Downton Abbey we watched a couple of episodes and were hooked.  Once we got the whole series we sat and watch 3 or 4 episodes at a time.  I would recommend them to anyone who enjoys history and especially British history.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game. I have been playing non stop since I down loaded it. Best free game I have ever played.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|From the start I didn't want to stop reading.  Really enjoyed the book start to finish.  I recommend this to read.
0307276902|2.0|A Million Little Pieces never finished. Slightly disappointed in this book after oprah recommended it to everyone to read. Then later changed her mind.
B00005QGAZ|4.0|Not much to say here, my son is a big Jackson fan so I picked this up as a Christmas gift, it is obviously a Jackson classic.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|Sons Of Anarchy Season 4  where has the time gone can't wait for season six. This is the best way to view.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|Recently, we ate at a Bubba Gump Shrimp restaurant (which I also recommend).  Our young son had a lot of questions about the movie, Forrest Gump.  We struggled to accuratly answer the questions since we had not seen the movie for a long, long time.  So, the next time we settled in to watch a movie as a family, we chose Forrest Gump.  Our son, loved the movie and my wife and I admitted we had forgotten what a great movie it is.<br />Tom Hanks is at his best, which is saying something.  The movie is sweet, but not syrupy.  If you have never seen the movie, you owe it to yourself to see it.  If, like us, you saw the movie several years ago, you owe it to the movie to see it again.
B009KZMFOA|4.0|Kaas makes the Piaf tunes her own--beautifully--now I regret not going to her Carnegie Hall concert in New York City.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|Nelson DeMille USED TO BE an excellent writer -- a true story teller.  I could not wait to finish The Panther.  I early caught on to the incessant wisecracks of John Corey and skipped paragraph after paragraph to avoid them...so high school.  The story itself was interesting.  I doubt that I will ever ever read another DeMile book.  So sad.  The early books were really gripping.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Monica bellucci is gorgeous. Gasper noe is a master filmmaker.  The story is heartbreaking.  Would be nice for a special edition version.
B0053O89JM|3.0|I don't have a racial axe to bear but I did think I might point out that the writers of House Season 8 left Omar Epps/Dr. Eric Foreman in charge. When all was lost and after the series-- the writing and the stories--- had gone into the crapper, then a black man was left in a position of authority. I'm not bothered by this and I don't think it was planned but if I was a black person looking for a chance to gripe then I might have noticed this. By season 8, oh hell, let the black guy be the head honcho. The show was by then scheduled for cancellation. Lisa Edelstein/Dr. Cuddy the old boss of Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital (PPTH) in New Jersey, was gone. In fact Edelstein's character was so far gone to where she wouldn't even make a cameo in season 8. If I was a critic I might think that Edelstein  didn't want to be associated further with a show which had become a joke and if not a joke but a caricature or a shadow of itself. Season 8 had no future, it was all about the exit plan.<br /><br />Season 8 is marred with so many episodes of some patient spitting up blood. And then there was the paralysis of what seemed like every other patient. Then there were the mindless and pointless head games that House played with himself and with his staff of doctors. Greg House just came off as some sort of crank, some sort of nutjob who was constantly acting like a nutjob because he could, because he was a brilliant doctor. And because Greg House was a brilliant doctor the hospital was going to bend over and give the man everything that he wanted like a wall that lifted up so he could see his buddy Dr. James Wilson/Robert Sean Leonard. And because House was brilliant the hospital tolerated it when he shot at his doctors with a paint gun, a squirt gun, when he tossed soda balloons, when he stole an expensive medical machine. The hospital also tolerated his war with the prosthetics department, and as House interviewed prostitutes. The prostitute idea and theme was in bad taste in other seasons but was over developed and overdone to adnauseum  last season. But once again people who tolerated Greg House had to sit through more of this. But in season 8 House just went nuts as he tried to strangle a patient which became just another behavior that one must tolerate when in the company of a brilliant doctor.<br /><br />In this last season the writers saw the exit of Dr. Pretty Boy Chase played by Jesse Spencer. I was glad to see Dr. Pretty Boy leave because as a mediocre boy I get my fill of these perfect sexy guys that get all the girls in real life and on tv. Of interest this season was Charlyne Yi, who played the Asian Dr. Park. I at least found her to be entertaining even though she didn't have a future on the show. And finally for Season 8 Dr. James Wilson developed cancer and after failing chemo therapy was left with about 5 months to live. Greg House goes out and takes heroin with a patient. He wakes up in a burning building, which is on fire and he has visits of dead or previous doctors from the hospital. Greg House supposedly dies in the burning building. But, SURPRISE, the burned dead body was not Greg House but it was his patient. Apparently all you have to do is to switch dental charts of a person and you have successfully faked your own death.<br /><br />So it is in this unbelievable scenario that Greg House takes off and onto the road with James Wilson via motorcycles.<br /><br />My problem is the ending was a joke and it just couldn't hold up to any scrutiny. And long gone was most any respect that many of us had for the character of Greg House. Greg House showed himself to be a selfish, egocentric JERK. And I think it was sad and rather telling that James Wilson rode off into the sunset with House the idiot. Really, was House any kind of a friend and if so did James Wilson really respect him and if so why?<br /><br />A lot of us in the real world have problems but we don't start going to prostitutes, drugs, alcohol, etc. Manyof us are also smart but we don't ruin the lives of everyone around us just because we are so brilliant. I'm sure a lot of brilliant men and women brought a lot of people into their lives of pain but never perhaps in the history of television was their ever such an indulged and self absorbed character who had so many people bending over and bowing down to his eccentric behavior. Greg House might as well have been King Greg House. I mean this character was allowed to do just about anything that he wanted. Thus the stories just became more and more RIDICULOUS over time.<br /><br />I used to respect the show but now I'm just glad that it is off of the air. And Season 8 was as others called it, A MISTAKE.<br /><br />Lisa Edelstein, kudos to you and your character for not coming back in season 8, the worst season of House.
B006XBSC8C|5.0|Great Katy Perry cd, was unsure about it at first but it is great.  it came in a timely matter and was everything that we expected.
B005MJDJQQ|4.0|If you like Mankell's Wallander novels, you will like this one too.  Perhaps one of the more twisting plot lines of the Wallander books (I haven't yet read quite all of them), I found it a bit plodding at times.  If you do like his portrayal of step-by-step detective methods, you will certainly enjoy this one.
B004JXXKWY|4.0|I found this compelling reading, the more compelling because it was true.  We all love to 'bank bash', and this book gives us good reason to keep on doing so.  The writing is good, and the content is terrifying.  I think you all should read it and then lobby to get yourself onto a bank board - any bank - lots of banks - and change the culture.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|My wife and I loved the TV series; we got this as a gift for our grown son who became intrigued after hearing us go on and on about the improbable story lines.
B007T99ENE|2.0|This was a much anticipated read, but sadly, I was left unsatisfied.  I think Mr McEwan has lost his way with this one.  Trying to be too tricky, too smart, but missing the spot for this reader.  My expectations were high, but even if I had not read 'Atonement', I think I would still give this low star rating.
B008QMMEOE|1.0|This app only has 4 free puzzles then asks the 3 or 4 year old to purchase other apps at a cost of $1.99 each.  I'm amazed at how many positive reviews this app received.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|This is a book I can unreservedly recommend.  Read it now!  It is thoughtful, human, and explains so much of our recent history and mores and relationships.  Enjoyed the use of 'the repeat' - made a big impact on me.  Splendid writing.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The story in engaging and the puzzles make sense in the context of navigating through the game. This is my 2nd G5 game purchased in just the last few days.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|This was bought as a gift for someone for Christmas. He loved the CD and is on continuous play right now! :))
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|The hints were helpful and the variety of games was really fun. I recommend this but with it was clear from the beginning that I had to pay to continue.
B002BWP49C|5.0|good movie arricved quickly and is something that I have wanted a long time.  Seems to be the same thing as in the stores
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Gave this too my son for Christmas and decided to watch it myself.  I great movie but quite long too!
0399226907|5.0|'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' is a staple for any child's book collection. All of Eric Carle's books have beautiful illustrations.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Love this show, and season 3 does not disappoint. I would definitely recommend it for anyone who likes entertainment and horror.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|It was disgusting!  My husband and I are too embarassed to even tell anyone we saw the movie.  The language was filthy.  Can't they make a funny movie without the filthy language!  I don't mind a couple of &#34;f&#34; bombs, but this was horrible!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really enjoyed it. It was the best hidden object game I've ever played. It loaded really slow in the beginning and I had to contact Amazon to actually order, but well worth the price and extra work
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Only took a few short hours to beat game wish there was more to it but it's addicting. Hopefully it get new updates for it to extend game play
B005I4JG80|5.0|Loved this book. It was entertaining and i enjoyed reading about one mothers view of raising her three young children in Paris.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Not like the original but it gives you a few Easter eggs from the old game. I like it but wait times are to long and you use energy to quick. Not a game for the waiting room but if you got a few mins every 30 mins. Do like seeing other people towns and the ability to help them and yourself. Got a lot going on but never enough resources or money.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I researched for hours for the best kindle fire case and this is what i found. I love this case! It holds the kindle very securely and the stand feature is very useful for watching movies.
B0047BBWFK|5.0|got this recently...great album..i have all of sade on vinyl..she is great..the lp is recorded very nicely and is a pleasure on vinyl..great buyer i got this from
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I got this set as a gift and i am very impressed. The packaging is great and comes with an informational book that the disks and tucked into. Perfect for any Alien fans!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|A touch slow,  but worth visiting the game twice a day.  It'd be nice to see the enemies ' cities.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|I love this charger for the magic mouse that comes with the iMac. It is so complementary to apple products and works perfectly!
B009CG2YDE|5.0|I like this little game a lot.  The difficulty level is good, the power ups are fun, and the story and cut-scenes are quirky and fun.  The 8-bit retro art is great.  I've played through it twice now.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|My toddler son loves this movie. Got a great deal on this dvd and we have been really enjoying it!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Worked no where near what was promised. This app was difficult to install and hard to use. Other applications do a far better job.
0375507256|5.0|This novel addresses the best and worst of humanity as experienced by a single soul over 6 lifetimes. Each storyline is interrupted by its succeeding storyline until the middle of the book. At this point each of the interlinked storylines concludes anti-chronologically. That may be confusing, but the overall story reads better this way. You'll get the gist as you read.<br /><br />The book itself is beautifully written. I recommend it to my friends and family ad infinitum, but I don't expect everyone to like it as much as I do.<br />Some parts require an open mind while others require a strong constitution. You will laugh and cry. You will be enraged at the human race's penchant for cruelty and overjoyed by our capacity to do right by each other. You will lose as much faith in humanity as you will find in it.<br /><br />Skip the movie and read the book. You'll be glad you did.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Awesome interface, lots of tools, easy to export drawings. This application allows the user to draw on the entire viewable area without closing the application or bringing up other menus (a feature that most other kindle drawing apps is lacking).
0375842209|5.0|You're not likely to forget this story!  A young girl, Leisel, is placed into foster care by her mother to give the child a chance to escape the poverty and cruelty that awaited her otherwise.  The death of her little brother causes Liesel to turn to books for comfort. When the war begins, books are being burned and are forbidden but Liesel begins to take extraordinary risks to steal books in her efforts to deal with the cruelty of the world around her.  Difficult to put down!
B0085YNML2|3.0|Fun at first, gets old pretty quick. Controls are pretty lame and basic. It is hard to get very involved or absorbed in this game.
030758836X|5.0|An interesting story that kept me constantly changing my mind about who the 'victim' was in this story of manipulation, treachery and revenge!  Not a book that can be put down easily!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Had to find out what came next.  Don't start these books unless you have nothing else to do for a few days.  Read all 3 in 3 days getting little sleep!  just couldn't put them down.  My husband and I had to fight for the kindle so glad I have app. on my iPod, too.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|Excellent, Excellent, Excellent. This shows why they have been, and still are, simply the best.<br />Right from the first chord to the last drum beat they play like they played in their heyday.<br />Many will pick a fault or two. I simply enjoyed a GREAT concert.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Had to find out what came next.  Don't start these books unless you have nothing else to do for a few days.  Read all 3 in 3 days getting little sleep!  just couldn't put them down.  My husband and I had to fight for the kindle so glad I have app. on my iPod, too.
6305308659|5.0|A movie that could easily become one of the great classics in only more people knew about it.  This movie provides a different view of issues such as racism, societal changes, and personal growth.  Provides good laughs with a look at 1950s TV shows view of life.
B008OE05IG|4.0|I enjoyed it quite a bit, but this word count for the review is really pissing me off, really! What Now?! I corrected the spelling on a work NOW! I have to add 20 more words? Screw doing reviews for these guys ever again.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time. Highly recommended this book to any one not just runners.
0545425115|5.0|Promptly send, couldn't be happier.  The ending of the book is much BETTER than the film! So if you saw the film first, like I did, don't cheat yourself out of this great book...especially from this dependable buyer.  I am now looking for the two follow up books to the series.<br />Thanks so much.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I put this book at five stars because there are no more. There is always a huge shock at the end of every winding road traveled in this book. You never see it coming. Absolutely breathtaking.....
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This show is very funny, I first watched one episode while visiting family and afterward decided to order the first season to try it out.  No regrets,  it is even more funny when you get to watch it over and without interruption. At the end the writter leaves comments you have to pause to read, some are strange, but most are funny.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Makes shopping for the wife a lot easier. Just about every thing  is there at your fingertips. You just need to do a little hunting and playing around till you find the info you want
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I enjoyed this book , it had a good story to it . The sex scenes were awesome . I would recommend the book to others .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book, I was in the story as a person watching the screens feeling the emotions the  characters had. To be honest I understood what was going on without having to think about it I will ALWAYS LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|One of my favorites, Glad I got it. All star cast, and always gets me right there. 3 more words needed
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Hope Springs , in my opinion, would be suited for mature audiences because of the context which is discussed. I thought  &#34;Hope Springs&#34; was slow at times.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this wireless remote for my 13 year old son as a Christmas present.  He hasn't gone one day without using since he opened it up.  He is very pleased with this purchase and so am I.
B005VPRFSY|2.0|Great marketing strategy to try and sell their product but what has happened to the quality. I would recommend this for the figurines but Lego has become cheap quality. No Lego products I have bought recently stays together. My son would rather use the Legos I still have from when I was a child then use this new Marketing junk.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I enjoyed the book even though I knew how it was going to end.  The love scenes were hot but a bit over the top and corny.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Game is very challenging using the smaller size pieces.  The only problem that is very irritating is where the ads are located next to the pieces. Always hitting the ad button when moving pieces.<br /><br />Very good gs<br />Avery good game using the qsmaller size pieces<br />A very good game using<br />A very challenging game when using the smaller size pieces. Enjoy very much. The only problem I have is the ad button being so close to the pieces. Very easy to touch the ad button when trying to move puzzle pieces which becomes very irritating at times. I thought about deleting it at one time but I invested in the horse puzzle. I still enjoy it I will have to be more careful.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I have only just started this game but so far it is really fun to play and it has good game play.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Enjoyed the movie and the Amazon Instant Video worked very well.  This was our first time using the Amazon service and for $3 less than Comcast, it will not be the last.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|As usual excellent story with twists. Nesbo always delivers an excellent Dectective Harry Hole my rider mystery this time in Australia
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|hi peeps I always wanted to get angry birds star wars I really want to get it but it always say this game cannot be download on your device but I see staff on YouTube about angry birds star wars and it looked awesome and it jaded these big monsters that you have to destroy this game looks fun and awesome but some day I will get this game and I am going to love it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Finished it the first day. Perfect combination of comedy and romance.  Will be reading her other books next.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Although the Stones have released many &#34;Hits&#34; packages over the years, I think this one is the best cross section<br />of their long careers.  Beware however:  There is a two disk version of this 3 disk package.  It has all of the same<br />packaging and graffics but omits 15 or so of the tunes from the 3 disk set.  Many major hits are missing from the<br />two disk version.  If you think your getting a price break, better check the content first.  Too bad the producers<br />chose to fool the fans and consumers.  They should never have realeased the inferior 2 disk version.  Hopefully<br />Amazon will not sell the 2 disk GRRR!  or will at least attempt to label it as less than the full version.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game to play. A very fast paced game! Keeps you on your toes.<br />If you like adventure, challenging, fast paced games. This is definitely the one to play.<br />I love it!<br />  -Chris
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great to have. comes in handy. bright and easy to use. plus its free which is nice. I have nothing else to say. its a calculator.

B008ELUEQC|5.0|i bought this for myself. i have been listening to rod sence the 1970s he is one of my favorite singers i am so glad that he is still making music
B008458O3S|1.0|Game will not launch, receive error &#34;Unfortunately, Trainyard has stopped&#34;. This on Nexus 7, Android 4.2. Game had initially worked, but failed on second launch.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I've been a fan of Chris Colder for a while and I saw the movie and just had to read the book. Although it didn't have Carson's commentary at his funeral (which was hilarious if you haven't seen the movie!) it was just as funny and I-don't-give-a-damn as I hoped. Five stars.
B00009R86L|2.0|I bought this to go with my new Domke shoulder bag, and used it for a month-long trip through central Mexico.  After a month of traveling with this shoulder pad, I'm ready to throw it away.  It's too heavy and cumbersome.<br /><br />Perhaps that's partly because it does it's job too well.  There are times when I want my bag resting on my hip.  Other times, I want to push the bag behind me, and out of the way.<br /><br />I found myself constantly adjusting the position of the shoulder pad to accommodate a simple 2-inch adjustment in bag placement.<br /><br />With a much heavier bag over my shoulder, I might find this pad to be more useful.  But if you're just carrying a standard camera bag, don't bother.
1419705849|5.0|Bought for our grandson, who needed this to complete his series.  He just loves this book and I'm sure he will reread them all again.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|Easy Buy. I recommend it to anyone who was a fan of the saturday morning cartoon. This is a living breathing cartoon :) awesome.
B0002DB0FO|2.0|I have raised 3 children to adulthood, 2 boys and 1 girl. Never, ever would I have allowed them to treat me like those children in the \\"highly acclaimed Everwood show\\" treated their parents. I wonder what is wrong with the parents of America these days that they think this is acceptable behaviour?<br /><br />My husband and I will give this series away, it is not worth watching a second time!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|If you haven't played any of these type games or if you've tried some but got confused  than this is an excellent beginner game.  I enjoyed it and will definitely try some other games from this company.  As a newbie to these games, this is the first I've tried that I didn't need to find an Internet walkthru to finish - and has given me a better idea - by guiding me a bit - of how these games work.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this app and so does my 5 year old son.  It's a challenge for him, but he definitely doesn't give up!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So i read the book first so it would make more sense. Good stylized read. Collins provides an interesting first person female narrative that I found enjoyable.
B005NFWCSK|5.0|It was a very good movie, and very entertaining. The plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole movie. Plenty of action.
B000VWYNNW|5.0|I had this album years ago and lost it somehow. Well, I wanted to get another copy and this one exceeded my expectations with new songs that were added!
B004SOR4H6|1.0|This is just another one of those Internet/Social Media holes that so many people are sinking into. It's not for me.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD and DVD! I wish I had been at the concert when it happened. However, the DVD was one heck of an experience!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|It was a good movie, and very entertaining. The plot keeps the viewer engrossed for the whole movie. Plenty of action. Much better than the Thor movie.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Angry Birds Seasons Free has Halloween and Christmas venues! It has about 10 venues and tons of levels in each one. It's easier in the beginning levels of the venue, but it gets harder, but not impossible. Very fun and appropriate for the holidays. Family time is important in the holiday season so take turns playing levels, laughing at the weird noises that the birds make, and still spending time together!!! I am not allowed to buy apps with money so I mostly only get free apps. Free is great!!!!!
B001F12J0C|5.0|I bought this for a friend for Christmas as he is a avid Bourne Movie fan.  He enjoys watching them more than once.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds Space Free isn't HD, but it has lots of levels and new actions for the birds. The background effects are very cool and are spacey. It's awesome and recommended! If you like Angry Birds, you are sure to like it in space!!!
B0052TDGQO|5.0|I bought this for a Christmas for a friend who loves his music.  She said it is great and happy I got it for her.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Saw it in the 70's.on our Honnymoon. My wife is a long time fan of Streisand and loved it. Where di all these years go.
0345803485|5.0|I highly recommend these books to anyone who wishes to live out a fantasy by reading these books.  My gosh!  Don't think I'll let my 83-year old mother borrow them - think of her heart!  Only complaint - the series has ended and now I am seeking out suggestions for similar books.  I've read all 3 books twice, and will read them again.  The second time around was better than the first, because I knew what was gonna happen next, and little things made more sense.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's. fun but it could use some improvements I like it but Jetpack Joyride tops it. As I said fun but not fun enough.
B004QBWU02|4.0|good movie. no skips and 2nd disc interview the actors and writters about making the movie.interesting story there also.enjoy that as much as the movie
B001F12J48|2.0|My expectations were dashed after viewing on my new Sharp Aquos 70 inch 3-D TV 20 min. into the movie. NOT 3-D at all. My grandchildren took off their 3-D  glasses to watch the movie. Viewing  was a hassle, as well as ruined the original color graphics by making everything look red and blue. Just terrible.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|i love it. i still have it. i would recommend for people to get the movie. i liked everything about it. i have nothing negative to say.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was an enjoyable read.  It lived up to the hype it's gotten.  It worth reading if you have the time.
B002BWP49C|5.0|i love it. i still have it. i would recommend for people to get the movie. i liked everything about it. i have nothing negative to say.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Best movie ever and amazon gave it to me at an unbeatable price with their lowest price pre order guarantee or whatever. So besides saving money it was also shipped the day of the release which was perfect (this part doesn't apply anymore but thought I'd include it). The quality was the best I had ever seen (played on my ps3). Everything was good so that's why I am giving this five stars. If I could change one thing about this product it would have to be the case. I dropped mine and it a small chip came out of the side fairly easy. Other than that five star quality!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|While I understand that movies based upon books cannot truly capture the full story due to time and medium constraints, I expected this movie to do more with the themes of Philip K Dick's source material of questioning Identity and the nature of reality. The original Total Recall I thought did a better job at this, as you were always questioning who Quaid truly was, a spy for the rebels, a spy for the corporations, or some schmuck sitting in a chair dreaming this. This remake teased and made a few references to it, but I think lacked the immersiveness in the theme I would have liked. Quaid in the remake seemed to come to grips much to fast with who he was and what the &#34;truth&#34; was.<br /><br />I did like the references to original movie and I don't think the removal of Mars from the plot hurt it. It was a good pace, and Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale were fabulous in thier roles (Kate a little more so than Jessica).<br /><br />Colin Farrel did a good job in his role, though I would have liked to see more range between who he was before Recall and who he was after. Arnold did a great job with this in the original. The video of him talking to his future self shows different linguistics and even a &#34;happier&#34; Arnold. Colin didn't quite pull that off here.<br /><br />One of the better &#34;action&#34; flicks in terms of plot and character development, but its lack of full immersion caused me to only give it 3 stars.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|Poltergeist is one of the best ghost films ever made.<br /><br />It has all the ingredients to back this up.<br />-----------------------------------------------------<br />The acting is top notch and the script has at minimum - great writing.<br />The SFX are rly good for it's time, and the bathroom/face scene is simply awesome!<br />Setting, sets and background shots are done very well.<br />Camera work, cinematography and lighting here are flawless.<br />The storyline is not 100% original, but it improves on what other movies of it's kind have done of the same in the past;  and also awesome with a remanu'd plot - much improved.<br /><br />This movie was well casted and the director, and the rest of the crew outdid themselves.<br /><br />Hats off to this great 80s ghost classic!<br />Brings back memories.  :-)<br /><br />Buying this movie is a no-brainer.<br /><br />5*
B002XHNMVM|5.0|My cup of tea!<br /><br />I love the concepts Sir Ken Robinson explores!<br /><br />He provides great insight and powerful examples to bring the points home.<br /><br />To me it relates with my own passion which is developing people's natural gifts and potential through coaching and training..<br /><br />Very valuable book!
B0091Q3254|5.0|Awesome DVD. Great concert at O2 plus bonus features, video trilogy and the acoustic show in Toronto. A must have for a Noel Gallagher fan.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Nothing fancy just Phillip Phillips being himself....great album.  Nice arrangements in each and every song.  This young man has a bright career ahead of him.  Way to go!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|So addicting!! One of the best free apps I have ever downloaded. The graphics are fantastic on my sanding s3 and my kindle fire. Hi5 on this one. o/
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Had to add this DVD to the Holiday collection my daughter is building. She loves the oldies and Jimmy Stewart is one of her favs. Shipping was quick, price was reasonable. I was able to take advantage of the free super saving shipping through Amazon as I purchased this along with another DVD set at the same time. A great bonus!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|Most of the songs are great. As Usual the &#34;Stanley&#34; songs are better than the &#34;Simmons&#34; songs. Thayer plays an important part on this record. Singer not so much and that's a shame. If the drums had been a bit louder in the mix this album would be worth 5 stars!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great time waster... the first levels were too easy for me but there were a couple kind of challenging ones towards the end. :) fun!
B004LROUNG|5.0|Finally back on his game! Not just the same old story, different day, different title! Good read , ESP if you had become bored with his recent (10 yrs) books!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game! I couldn't put it down! I loved the story line but some of the puzzles were kinda hard.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Extremely well done and exciting series!! Cannot wait to watch the next episode . Actors are suberb and make every scene authentic
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This was a great conclusion to the series, but I wondered (especially in the beginning of the book) whether a full third book was necessary. It drags on a bit with detail and a few plot deviations that seemed unnecessary. I think two longer books would've been a better option. And maybe I'm a bit slow but I still don't understand the title of this one!
B0076DELIG|4.0|Not best of Connelly's books but still entertaining.  I had to stop and start  a lot because of outside interruptions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My pulse raced from start to finish. Very well-written and imaginative. I was unsure of the premise, as the thought of kids killing other kids was unsettling, but it is written with a survivalist's twist and made it easier to read.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Always liked hotmail. Never had any problems with hotmail always works. Contacts and emails always secure. Shopping and bing easy to use.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Works much better than the browser. I have not had the trouble with the timeline that others have reported. I am using the kindle fire hd.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Trilogy is a must have, great story line and action.  Can't wait till batman and robin come out.  Best movie
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game allows my family to connect and laugh with each other on our portable devices. In these days when everyone seems to be so busy it gives us all a fun family moment, even if we can't be in the same room. Great game!!!!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I would recommend this for someone who wants all the movies in a small box set! The movies are all fantastic as they have always been. The bluray adds a nice shiny coat to the movies, and the bluray case is much smaller and takes up as much space, as 2 bluray's.<br /><br />Great product!!!! :-)
B005WUHAX8|1.0|first time i have ever written a review.  this case made my daughter's new iphone 4s impossible for either party to hear the other.  it was a gift for her away at college.  to make matters worse, by the time she received her phone and we realized the case was not going to work, my window for returning it had expired.  i am very dissatified.
1451688091|5.0|Loved the book for the insight to how Lincoln accomplished his political goals & made our country a better place for all Americans.  Very pertinent reading for today's political situation.
1419705849|5.0|This is the best series for the young readers.  My 10 yr old son loves to read them over and over again.
B009ANP48G|5.0|muy buen 3d la peli y el cover genail, recomendando para todos los fanaticos! no lo duden un minuto !
B007PT1PEY|5.0|The Complete Sherlock Holmes (the Heirloom Collection) Excellent readability for the Ipad 3.  The use of the Kindle store for outstanding older books for IPad use is outstanding.  Good selection of stories,  Conan Doyle was an excellent story teller of another generation.  Reading these Sherlock Holmes stories gives one a sense of 19th century Britain.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. Its very good. I could play this for hours.In the next update iwould like roller coasters and water and lava buckets.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|I recently watched all seven seasons of this series, and was caught up again in the loves, laughs and heartaches of the Gilmore Girls.  It's a fast paced, well written, and well directed series.  I bought the last season to find out what happened as I'd missed all of the last season when it was on television, and was curious.  Well, my curiosity was satisfied beautifully.  Although I admit I hated to finish such an enjoyable series.<br />Lauren Graham is Lorelai Gilmore the mother of lovely Rory Gilmore, played by Alexis Bledel, a brilliant girl who dreams of Harvard.  Lorelai is the manager of a lovely little inn snug in Stars Hollow, Connecticut. She started working at the inn when she was sixteen, having left her wealthy Hartford family due a never ending quarrel with her parents.<br />The series picks up with Rory in highschool, and Lorelai in her never ending quest for good coffee. Sookie the inn's chef,  is played by Melissa McCarthy, creating meals and laughs in her kitchen, and Luke Danes, played by Scott Patterson, is creating laughs and meals in his diner. What with all the other quirky characters in Stars Hollow, the series is irresistible.
B0095R6OBS|3.0|I thought this was a cute short movie.  Could have been a little longer.  Loved Sparky.  I would not recommend this movie.
1423389409|5.0|Beautifully written and having &#34;read&#34; the audiobook, Nick Podehl does a wonderful reading. I also found myself not wanting to put the book down and with the audiobook, I rarely did. I so look forward to the next book but until then I will just practice spinning leaf.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Even though it's not their best work, it's good to have No Doubt back together. Settle Down is an awesome song that has been stuck in my head for weeks.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|so much fun. someday maybe my kids will get a chance to play. LoL. but seriously its so addictive. get the game!!!!!!
1600597963|5.0|I love this book so much and accidentally ordered 2 but sold one to a fellow beader.  Now the holidays are over I am hoping to try many new projects.
0307269981|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this series of books!  I could not put them down!  Love when I get into a series that keeps my interest!!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Lots of fun to play very fun you should play this game it's fun it is really awesome I recommend this fun game
B003SI05PG|1.0|Neither the teenage kids nor parents liked this one at all. It was just weird and not entertaining at all
B008X8P8A8|5.0|The game is very cleverly built combining depth with simplicity. All battles are fought in a small hexadecimal grid, yet you simultaneously need to control your troops, built your buildings, manage resources and select reinforcements. The end result is a very engaging experience very you have mere seconds to think about tactics.<br /><br />The graphics are beautiful as well as the sounds. More artistic than stunning.<br /><br />The AI in the hardest level is moderate. It doesn't use precise tactics, yet due to the nature of the game it can manage things faster. You can outsmart it yet while you do so the AI is just preparing another wave. It's built mostly to make the game fun than challenging.<br /><br />The campaign is not too short but not vast as the original series. There is no selection of factions or even really anything you do on the map. It is simplistic in that sense, the whole gameplay is on the grid. The interest comes on slowly exploring new units that offer new solid tactics.<br /><br />The units are really nice, both in gameplay and feel. There is a big selection and every unit gets 4 soldiers. Melee units, your typical sword and spear soldiers. Archers that are quite devastating. And matchlocks that are even more devastating but need their space. Range units fire only straight yet melee attack sideways as well.  This you could say is the core of the tactics since you cannot change rows at will. Cavalry is very fast, yet weak. No charge bonus, but good for blitz tactics. Then there the monk versions of those that give a bonus to nearby units adding to the choices and tactics. And  there are ninja which are brilliant. They can simply avoid any unit except monks, though they get revealed when attacking. They are excellent for counter attacking offering yet another angle. Last, there are cannons. Deadly with a ridiculous range, but stationary. Since you have a limit of the amount of units they balance offset and defense.<br /><br />The building are justperfect. You built them in the same grid you fight effectively and they need to be positioned near sources and somehow tied together. They help alter the terrain while offering cover or a strategic target.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game that requires little actual thought. Everyone in my household really enjoys it.<br />We take turns playing and leveling up.
B005HZN082|5.0|Great quality, and the pictures, oh they left me speechless, all my friends loved them, they are reserved for the major poker nights, for regular poker nights we use common cards.
0451232852|5.0|Can't put it down.  As good as Pillars of the Earth, if you are famliar<br />with Ken Follett.  Good stuff.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Great item, functions perfectly, of course, it's sony brand, long lasting battery, it fells great to use new controllers, my previous controllers run out of life after 4 years.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This really was a good movie. Glad I added it to my collection and I'll be watching it again real soon.
B002N7CTKM|4.0|I love Community - I've seen the entire series more times than I should admit.  In addition, the price for this was excellent, compared to the DVD release.  That said... I'm a bit disappointed.  One of the reasons I like purchasing shows is instead of just watching them on TV or Hulu is that I don't have to deal with logos for the network popping up.  It's generally just the clean picture.  On these releases, I don't get that.  It's like somebody videotaped the show on their TV and then sold it to me.  I got a good discount, yes, and I get to watch it, but it's a slight annoyance.  I ended up getting this on DVD, though I still use this version when I'm somewhere where DVDs aren't as usable.
0385523912|4.0|\\"What [Mi-ran] didn't realize is that her indifference was an acquired survival skill. In order to get through the 1990s alive, one had to suppress any impulse to share food. To avoid going insane, one had to learn to stop caring.\\"<br /><br />Nothing to Envy  follows the lives of \\"ordinary\\" (i.e., suffering, i.e. everyone not Kim Jong-Il) North Koreans. The title comes from a North Korean propaganda song. When it comes to patriotic songs in the hermit kingdom, what's featured of it in the book seems fairly tame when it comes to xenophobia. Others, not so much:<br /><br />\\"One of the songs taught in music class was \\"Shoot the Yankee Bastards\\":<br /><br />Our enemies are the American bastards<br /><br />Who are trying to take over our beautiful fatherland.<br /><br />With guns that I make with my own hands<br /><br />I will shoot them. BANG, BANG, BANG.\\"<br /><br />The author does a fine job in setting up the most horrifying aspects of life in a country whose ruler proclaims that his people live in paradise, a paradise in which they must grind treebark until it's edible just to have a meal that day. The enforced belief in this place is that they are not unlucky -- quite the opposite, they are taught that they are the luckiest people in the world:<br /><br />In the years before her defection, [Mi-ran] had worked as a kindergarten teacher in a mining town. In South Korea she was working toward a graduate degree in education. It was a serious conversation, at times grim. The food on our table went uneaten as she described watching her five- and six-year-old pupils die of starvation. As her students were dying, she was supposed to teach them that they were blessed to be North Korean.<br /><br />There were a few moments, here and there, which it seems the author is dramatizing. Hard to say, since she is apparently taking these stories from people who have defected, and was not present most (if anything) that happened.<br /><br />A minor issue with an otherwise fine book. Iwould have been interested in a longer exploration of the problems North Korean refugees face when integrating to the South, as well as the attitudes South Koreans have towards them.<br /><br />Highly recommended. 4/5 stars.
1594487154|5.0|What goes through your mind when you think of someone who works in sales? Why is there still a need for the salesperson? What if I (or better yet Dan Pink) told you that not only are we all in sales but it is a crucial part of your job? Dan Pink's new book To Sell Is Human: The Surprising Truth About Moving Others may turn your idea of what selling is upside down. And you will thank him for it. Dan Pink (author of A Whole New Mind, Drive) shows how the old sales idea of Always Be Closing is now replaced by Attunement, Buoyancy and Clarity. The author points out that 1 in 9 people are actually in sales but the other 8 out of 9 are in what he calls \\"non-sales selling\\"; moving or influencing others to benefit all involved. Dan does a wonderful job of taking data and information from science, research and statistics and synthesizes it into relevant advice for the CEO of the office and of the home. An important message from the book is why the warmer, compassionate personal and social skills are more advantageous to have in today's world than aggressive cold-calling techniques. He'll discuss why the \\"elevator pitch\\" used during our fathers' time is as outdated as our fathers' ties, and the six successors of that type of pitch.<br />I work as a doctor of physical therapy in my spare time from being a dad, husband, brother, son and community member. As a treating therapist, director and co-owner of my clinic I interact personally with patients, their families, physicians, employees, colleagues, vendors and the public. I use 2 techniques Dan discusses in the book - make it personal and make it purposeful-to \\"sell\\" the importance of my skills and experience to improve others. Dan Pink's books have had as big an influence on my daily doings inside and outside of work as any other author. At the end of To Sell Is Human Dan asks 2 important questions: (to paraphrase) 1. Will what you're selling improve the buyer's life? and 2. Has your interaction served its purpose to make theworld a better place? In regards to this book, with clarity I can definitively answer for myself \\"yes\\" and \\"yes\\".  This book is worth the read.<br />Please note: I received a copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own. They haven't been edited or approved by anyone.
1608871088|5.0|This was a christmas gift to a special young lady. She absolutely adores it! I can't ask more than that! Great product and it arrived well before Christmas.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|This album is touching, moving, beautiful and speaks to the soul.  For $5 this album is a steal.  Fiona Apple is an original artist that has really come into her own style.  Her songs and lyrics are raw emotion and you feel privileged to sit in and experience what she is sharing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is really fun.  Works great on Kindle Fire HD.  Would recommend if this is the type of game you like.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|She LOVES IT!!  I think she has listened to this everyday since she opened it.  We went by her house the other day to see her and it was playing.  She has been a Rod Stewart fan for as long as I can remember.  I'm glad that she is enjoying the music.  You gotta love you some Rod!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I play this often. It's much more polished than Adele 19. I'm glad she got her voice back. It would have been a big loss if Adele could not sing anymore.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Needed something to play my iPod in my ride (we don't have a AUX input in either of our vehicles). This works very well. Sound quality more than sufficient. I had to send the first one back because when I took it out of the plug after a few uses it fell part. Probably just got a slightly defective unit or maybe just the way I twisted it when I pulled it out. Amazon was fantastic on the return and I've had no problems at all with the replacement. Worth every penny.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Adele 21 is much better. Adele 19 is not as pleasing to listen to. It's a bit amateurist- not as polished as 21.
B00461BQC0|5.0|Love the album - it will definitely be in my long-term rotation. Probably my favorite KOL album even though the others are very good.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|This book is a wonderful story that illustrates the love a mother and father have for their children regardless of how they were conceived. It also sheds light on foreign customs and traditions and how they affect family dynamics and relationships. I enjoyed how the story was told from many different perspectives.<br />I wished it had ended differently because although it was realistic, I wanted more closure for the characters that I had come to love and care about.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|What a story!  Like they said, not just another gangster story, but a family epoch.  A riveting page-turner that will live for decades!
B009B2U73I|5.0|A bit different from the Krall we know and love, but it's still D. Krall, smooth, silky, sexy Krall.  Worth the price !
1608871452|5.0|What a great item to have around the house.  Everyone loves it and spends time looking at it.  Great for fans of the show and really peaks the interest of those who haven't watched it, after telling them about the show, I think I have started new fans!!!
B00APUQJLO|3.0|I wanted to see this movie because I like Robert Pattinson.  But this movie (and his acting) didn't meet my expectations until Robert & Paul Giamatti started interacting towards the end.  (I think I was happy to finally get out of that limo...)  If you haven't read the book and/or you're looking for a movie that's to the point - this is not for you....
B0000AUHOH|1.0|What a clusterf—! With William Shatner directing, and ILM dropping out for effects, the best parts of this movie are Spock singing campfire songs and Uhura showing us some hidden talents.<br /><br />Rather annoyed I had to get this movie to complete my collection, but oh well.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|It's like Family Guy on the big screen.  The drug humor is starting to get old for me...  But still very funny.  I do recommend.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I really like it a lot. SLR Camera and Video camera will fit in this bag so I only need one bag. Having a baby I will need both with me at all time.
B0053O89WY|5.0|In the fifth season Big Bang is still going strong. Characters that could be bad stereotypes continue to delight! This season includes some important (and hilarious) changes for Sheldon and Amy as well as more of the trials and tribulations of Leonard's love life. If you liked the previous four seasons, you will love season five as well!
B009OA57MI|5.0|this is a very fun game to pass time it is a reasonable price too I think that they put more time into the graphics than F/A18 carrier landing so I give this rating 5 stars GOOBYE EVERYONE!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The author really keeps it going and difficult to guess what happens next. I like the love triangle and can't wait to see what happens in book 3.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Awesome Game to play great for the entire family this is one of the must haves our kids love it,I love it and my husband love it as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|From the time I read the first book, I couldn't stop<br /> until I read the last page of the last book .....only to want more!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book brought me to tears more than once. It was so much to take in, but it was well worth the read.
B009H442DG|5.0|I have always been a fan of John Trvolta and Olivia Newton John, and was so happen they reunited to record This Christmas.  Also, enjoyed the other celebrity singers who joined them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved this book,I could not put it down! Can't wait to read the next one ! Love the hunger games!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Just as Mitch Albom' s other books, this is a quick and easy read and provokes thought while reading.  Highly recommended.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I bought this DVD on recommendation of a friend. This is a good movie with several unexpected twists that make it a very interesting story. The DVD I bought is used. It was in like new condition with the original case and everything. I would be comfortable buying more things from this seller.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie is a must see and enjoy for everyone over 40 that sees the past more than the future.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Talent, some great commentator dialogue and the &#34;feel good&#34; vibe of an uncomplicated storyline make this a feel good film.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Great addition to the Bourne trilogy! Entertaining and worth the $.  Would recommended to everyone on the fence or just wanting to watch an section flick.
B003PTP4S6|5.0|Really lovely CD. Found this by mistake, and after samping it, had to have it. A must for soundtrack lovers and classical collectors as well.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Fun easy to play game.  This game works really well to keep my kids (and me) occupied.  Would recommend for any age.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Perfect for whole family. Best line: Santa, if you are real, why can't I see your house on google earth?
B008NB0SQO|5.0|My 5 year old niece wanted this movie for Christmas the price was right and the shipping was super fast. Couldn't be happier with this purchase, now I want to watch the movie with her, love the Muppets! Thanks Amazon for a convenient shopping experience.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great story, effects, and camp! And, that whole space-time continuum/paradox thing? Don't worry about it. Even non Trekkies will like.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is addicting; a favorite of mine. Playing online is so much more satisfying than the old- fashioned way.
0425263916|5.0|I love the series and am looking forward to the next book.  The condtion of the book was excellant, just like all the books I have purchased through Amazon.
0345803493|5.0|It was a great follow up to the first book.  I absolutely loved it.  It takes a surprising twist towards the end and it keeps you on the seat of your pants wanting more.  I can't wait to read the final book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The harsh realities shape a young girl as she fights to survive.  Katness is the perfect innocent survivalist who makes this coming of age story pop.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I luved the first book, but the second and third books in the series do NOT do the BDSM community justice and seem to imply that we all need fixing. Not happy with the rest of the trilogy. Could have better spent my money on a different series.<br />Definitely not the &#34;flavor&#34; of storyline I was expecting after such a dynamic first book.<br />Very :-(

0547995660|4.0|Short but thought-provoking.  I picked it up because I've seen this title every time I read a review on an utopia/dystopia young adult book and was curious. I've read various books with very similar ideas (Delirium and Matched) of a society where everything has been decided for them to avoid suffering, wrong-doing and chaos; but is that a life worth living? No uncertainty but also no control. No suffering but also no passion. No choices, no freedom.<br /><br />Jonas was selected to be The Receiver of Memories of everybody that has ever existed so that people don't have to carry their burden.  Only he will learn from these experiences and will have the wisdom to advice society on unprecedented matters.<br /><br />&#34;The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories are meant to be shared.&#34;<br /><br />I had this interesting thought that this is how I feel about reading books. I experience someone else's memories or stories and it makes me wiser although they are situations I've never been through.

Jochum BPO also good. Jochum Dresden also great and because it is a shorter version (Nowak), fits on one CD  while Wand and Karajan are on 2 CDs.

B005LAIII0|5.0|I'm one of the few people that couldn't get into the book this movie is adapted from. Try as I might, I thought it moved extremely slow and it had a hard time holding my attention. With this in mind, I went into the theater for the film expecting to feel the same way when it was over. Suffice to say, at the end of the movie I felt emotionally rewarded and thoroughly entertained.<br /><br />In fact, it was one of the most visually pleasing films I've seen in a while and I was very impressed with the cast. A lot of credit has to be given to newcomer Suraj Sharma as the title character, who brings a lot of passion and emotion to the screen. His performance was top notch and I look forward to seeing him in future roles. I was also impressed with Irfan Khan who plays the adult version of Pi, whose role in the film is the retelling of his story to a novelist. Equally impressive was Ang Lee's direction of the film. Many critics described \\"Life of Pi\\" as the \\"unfilmable\\" book but Lee does a magnificent job with the task and doesn't waste any opportunities to wow the audience with breathtaking visuals.<br /><br />This movie more than exceeded my expectations. If you enjoyed the book, you're sure to enjoy the movie. If you're like me and you just couldn't enjoy the book, give the movie a shot. This may be one of those rare occasions in which the movie is better than the book it's adapter from. Highly recommended.

B0068MNO4S|4.0|Anonymous is a smart, intriguing tale that introduces a complex conspiracy regarding one of the world's most renowned writers. The bare-bones gist of the plot poses that question of whether the man known as William Shakespeare was really the man who composed the plethora of plays and poems that he was given credit for. There's mystery and conspiracy abound, and enough twists and turns to please any fan of the genre. I will say that the movie can get a little muddled and confusing if your attention wanders for a minute, and the story jumps between multiple time periods quite frequently. While this isn't necessarily a caveat of the film, it does require the viewer to put everything aside while watching it. If you're able to do that, you're in for a fascinating, if incredulous, movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A heartwarming read from a dog's point of view.  As a dog lover and owner, I can only hope my dog has such thoughts.  If you don't believe in reincarnation, put your disbelief aside and enjoy the story.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|The anticipation and buzz surrounding this adaptation of the beloved book and musical has been extremely high since the first trailer came out and we heard Anne Hathaway's beautiful and haunting voice for the first time. Since then, it's been on many critics lists as an Oscar favorite. While moving and emotional, for me, the movie fell a little flat.<br /><br />First of all, there's no denying the talent attached to this film. Tom Hooper, following up his critically acclaimed and brilliant film The King's Speech gives the film great direction and captures the look and feel of 19th-century France. Likewise, the cast is on the top of their game here; Jackman is great as Jean Valjean and utilizes his previous Broadway experience here very well. I was also impressed with Seyfried, as I didn't know she had such a lovely singing voice, as well as newcomer Samantha Barks, who is sure to benefit greatly from her breakout role here. The true standout however, at least for me, was Hathaway. Her performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is truly moving and was my favorite song from the film. Though she isn't in the movie as much as I would have liked, I think her supporting role is more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. The one actor whom I felt was out of place was Russell Crowe. While he has a decent singing voice, it didn't blend with that of the other actors. I don't know if it was lack of stage performance or what but his performance just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest caveat I have with the film is the length. I know this was adapted from one of the most critically acclaimed plays in history but with a running time of nearly three hours, it overstayed it's welcome. It may be that Hooper was scared to leave anything out for fear of upsetting the fan base, but surely there could have been some scenes that shouldn't have made the theatrical cut.<br /><br />Finally, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the fact that the actors sang their parts on camera instead of recording beforehand. Call me crazy but I actually prefer the prerecording method. Not to say it isn't impressive that this was done but there were a few lines I couldn't understand because the actor singing ran out of breath or was singing so softly. It may be nitpicking but there it is. I feel like touching up some of the songs could have added that much more to the film's power and majesty.tead of recording beforehand.

B00A0ABQLM|5.0|[Design: I like it.]<br />The design is very minimalistic with 1 feet length, which I like. There are three LED lights, red LED indicates it is connected to USB 3.0 (if you connected it to a USB 2.0 port, then you won't see this red light), green for data transmit, and blue to show it's connected/recognized. It would have been better if the description was marked net to the LED, but it is written in the manual. (I know, who reads the manual these days? I had to read it just to make sure I'm not passing wrong information.)<br />Cable being 1 ft, it is perfect for laptops, although you can let it hang on the desktop's USB port too.<br /><br />[Performance: Awesome - Much better than intel's gigabit on my intel DH67CF motherboard.]<br />My desktop has the Anker USB 3.0 to gigabit adapter plugged in a USB 3.0 port, and acting as a host. The client computer is Thinkpad x230t (IvyBridge) with intel's gigabit ethernet.<br />When copying huge movie files from the host, it starts transfering at over 100 MB/s (about 95% gigabit utilization) for a while until my laptop's memory fills up, then it slows down to about 75 MB/s (about 50% of gigabit utilization). This is pretty darn fast.<br />I tried this test using my desktop's integrated intel gigabit port (motherboard is intel DH67CF board, SandyBridge), and I only got about 45MB/s. I couldn't believe the Anker is almost twice as fast! I checked both adapter's settings, and jumboframe was not even enabled, everything was at their default settings.<br /><br />I also tried moving the device on to a USB 2.0 port now on my desktop. It still shows I'm connected at gigabit speed, but transfer speed is now capped at about 29 MB/s (25% utilization), which is the limit of USB 2.0. It's still much faster than 100 mbps ethernet (which gives 10 MB/s), and faster than 300 mbps wireless N (5 MB/s - 15 MB/s)connections.<br />When I tried this adapter on my Windows 8 tablet, it automatically picked up the drivers, and installed with no problems. I did get good results again for a USB 2.0 port. This will be my primary media transfer mode for the Atom tablet now.<br /><br />[Compatibility: Great - Windows 7 requires driver CD, Windows 8 just plug and play.]<br />The driver CD includes drivers for the following: Windows XP, Vista, 7 (x86/x64), 8, OSX.<br />I tried it in Windows 7 x64 on my desktop, and it required the driver CD. I had no problem installing the driver. When I tried it in my tablet which has Windows 8 32bit, it automatically picked up the driver so no driver was needed. I only have Linux in a virtual machine, so I wasn't able to test if it also works in Linux or not, but I read it works well without a problem.<br />OSX Maverick: Works perfect. You do need to install the driver, but it's really easy to install, and then you are set. I bought a retina MBP13 2013, and it's doing wonders! I get near 100MB/s transfer speeds (transferring between SSDs over gigabit lan). Google for \\"ASIX AX88179 OS X driver\\", and get the driver from the manufacturer.<br /><br />[Reliability: Great]<br />I had this plugged in and used it as a main network device for 24 hours x 2 days straight, running a online game that I play, just to test for problems or anything. Had no disconnections, almost no heat (can barely feel it), no wacky behaviors during the whole time.<br />On my rMBP13, I did several TimeMachine backups which takes a long time because my NAS only gets about 30-40MB/s, and it never had any problem.<br /><br />[Summary]<br />Performs better than I expected.<br />I got this mainly for my Samsung XE-500T (Atom Z2760, Windows 8) tablet, which doesn't have wired ethernet jack. This is probably the case for most of the Ultrabooks that are being released in the market these days.<br />I would also recommend this for people with Macbook Air, or Retina version Macbook Pro 13/15 which doesn't have the ethernet jack. Apple sells ethernet adapters that use Thunderport, but that's $29, and Thunderport is hard to find on PCs.<br />This will be handy for my x230t laptop even though I have integrated gigabit ethernet since I can now plug all the stuff in to one of those 4 port or 7 port USB 3.0 hub. Even if you only have USB 2.0 port, this will be three times faster than competitor's USB 2.0 100mbps adapters.<br /><br />Review edited on 2013/11/13 to reflect my experience with rMBP13 2013.<br />Download Maverick drivers by searching for \\"ASIX AX88179 OS X driver\\".

B009VSW15Y|1.0|O.K. The first thing you need to know is that you DO NOT need this app as I discovered by accident today. The features this app unlocks are already there as a hidden app in the Kindle HD, it's just that there is no short-cut to it! Crazy but true.<br /><br />This camera is meant for use on Skype, hence the forward facing only and there are two ways to get to the app. Unhappy with the limitations of managing apps when I have lots of them, I downloaded an app called GoToApp Demo, available from the Amazon App Store, (don't be fooled by the Demo part, it's not, it's a fully working version, the company that produces it is actually called Demo), it's a great programme and finds ALL your apps and puts them into suitable folders for you, like Games, Tools etc. After it had done it's job, I had all my apps in folders with the exception of BBC News, Google Earth and an app called \\"Camera\\" it seems that was included in the Kindle Fire HD 7.2.2 update on the 7th Dec 2012, these it had put into the Main Section.<br /><br />I tapped this and was amazed to see not only a camera function but also one for Panorama and for Video. The camera has lots of features such as altering White Balance, Exposure, Scene Mode, Camera Settings and a Zoom Function.  Haven't worked out how to use the Panorama yet but the Video element has Zoom and White Balance like the Camera, it also has Background Effects, a Time Lapse Function and Video Quality, 480, 720 & 1080 but BEWARE, choosing 1080 causes it to crash and you are unable to change it back to 720, instead you will have to go to Settings/Applications/installed Applications/Camera and then Clear Data which will reset it to 720. Hopefully they will fix this in the next update.<br /><br />The other method of accessing the Camera app is to use a file manager (I used ES File Explorer) to find your app manager and then category, then system apps where you will find Camera and be able to open it up, there isn't a way to create a short-cut to the app. I would need to go into ES File Explorer each time to access it, the  GoToApp Demo app is so much easier.<br /><br />So it's already all there waiting for you to use it, just update your software if you haven't already done so

1451695195|3.0|This was a pretty good read. I soaked it up until about 2/3 of the way through when it became apparent that he had no new insights to offer on spiritual truths and his general reasoning seemed flawed.<br /><br />My first unease occurred when he described a skydiving incident in which a fellow diver who was below him deployed his chute. This was a very dangerous situation since the author could easily have plunged through the top of the opened chute dooming both of them. He states that he was able to instantly maneuver out of the way because his external mind (not his brain) did the necessary thinking to accomplish that difficult task, and prior experience from many jumps wasn't involved. Now come on! If that was the case, no one would ever have an accident, our external minds would always understand how to avoid them and we'd always do just the right thing to avert disaster! Let me assure you, if I was the one in the authors situation, with my total inexperience skydiving, I would have plunged directly into the other chute and I wouldn't be writing this now. My \\"external mind\\" wouldn't have been there to save me!<br /><br />The only \\"message\\" comes on page 46: \\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever. You have nothing to fear. There is nothing you can do wrong.\\"  That's it. Supposedly he had multiple encounters with God in the \\"core\\" where God taught him many things, much faster than could possibly happen on earth. But what were they? He says God, or \\"Om\\" as he calls Him, told him of many universes (anyone heard of the mult-universe theory in physics?). He says that evil is necessary for free will and is sprinkled throughout the universes, though earth has an extra share (of course). He says that explanations will be found for dark matter and dark energy (couldn't we all have said that?). At one point he says that it will take years to unpack all that he learned with Om. Can we expect future volumes where he dribbles out rediscovered tidbits? I'm groaning at the thought.<br /><br />He attaches much personal importance to the revelation of the identity of his female guide during his journeys. Supposedly, he recognises this person who he has never seen before, when he sees a family photograph of his unknown-to-him deceased sister and realizes that she was his guide. (Big emotional tear-jerking moment here.) Nice story, but his own writing refutes this. By his own admission a few pages before, he had PREVIOUSLY seen this same photograph not long before and had NO RECOGNITION of this person. Suddenly this sounds not like an amazing revelation but simply an implanted memory. One day he sees the photo and recognises no one, a few days or a week later he sees the same photo and low and behold the young woman is now his spiritual guide! Sorry, it just doesn't work for me.<br /><br />Finally, I don't think any of his musings on possible explanations for his experience, and his \\"refutation\\" of them, in any way constitutes scientific proof. I find it amusing how physicians think of themselves as scientists. Learning some chemistry and biology and how to apply that knowledge to the human body does not by any means produce the skeptical and critically thinking mindset of a scientist. The man who fixes my car knows about materials and forces and electronics. But he's not a scientist or an engineer; he's a mechanic. In the same way, a physician is not a scientist or an engineer, they are mechanics, they fix the human body. I don't mean to detract from the knowledge and expertise necessary to be a physician, only that physicians have the fundamental mindset of a mechanic, not a scientist, and that is what the author exhibits.<br /><br />So, by the last 1/3 of the book, all hope of any interesting insights was dashed and I ended the book feeling generally disappointed.  Still, it was a pretty good read and I did enjoy much of it.
0307279189|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews on this book and found good information in most of them, ranging from one star to five. The book motivated many 5-star reviewers to purchase and run in the Vibram Five Fingers minimalist shoe. Some took it a step further and began running barefoot.<br /><br />Perhaps this is the way to go, but I'm not convinced. I run about six marathons a year - in times generally fast enough to win an age bracket award but nowhere fast enough to come close to finishing near the leaders. After having suffered a non-running accident several years ago, I wear orthotics, which work well for me. (I damaged tendons on the bottom of my foot and dented the calcaneus bone - from a silly fall in my kitchen.)<br /><br />Now, I understand the concept behind the minimalist movement but am waiting for some studies to be released by podiatrists on injuries associated with wearing these shoes. I walk once a week with a friend of mine who is a podiatrist and an accomplished runner. He was a high school star and ran for four years in college. He understands the biomechanics of running and can evaluate gait and posture very well. And he treats a lot of runners.<br /><br />He tells me that he now sees, on average, two new patients a week who have metatarsal fractures as a result of wearing minimalist shoes. Perhaps these fractures were caused by the runners being overweight. I don't know. But I've got a suspicion that we'll see articles and studies in the next few years documenting more injuries from this style of running. Time will tell. In the meantime, be careful ... unless you restrict your running to the beach.
B00006FM77|5.0|Most of you reading these reviews already know what a great album 'At Carnegie Hall' is. If you're still on the fence as to whether or not to spend money on this remaster, SPEND THE MONEY! The painstaking amount of work that went into this remaster makes for a jaw-dropping, goosebump-filled listen. Yeah, the scaled-down replicas of the original posters are really pretty cool. Yeah, the extra disc of alternate and left-out versions of the performances is interesting. But buy it for the beatiful sound quality  contained in the first three 'original concert' discs. It's like listening to it all for the first time again. This package makes me feel like I'm 16 again.

B00000D9TQ|3.0|Some songs are good, but some I don't like that much. In general some of the songs are my old favourites.
0446547646|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of the best authors and that I have read and  I have never had a bad book from him. Ever!!!
B000BBOV8U|3.0|I like many of Bryan Adams songs and therefore I bought this CD. There are some songs there I don´t like that much, but in general this is a valuable CD
B0086700CM|5.0|It has intuitive controls and engaging gameplay. It is kind of strange to be able to make the gesture for a command and then see it happen a moment later, but I'm guessing the absence of that with an instantaneous-only input would get hair-pulling. Temple Run is a quality game that is easy to pick up. My niece and nephew---the youngest nephew isn't yet old enough to understand video games---introduced me to the franchise, and it is a good one.
1594744769|5.0|This book was so unique and well writen I hope there is a book two and it seems that it was left open for one...heres hoping.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I'm pleased with it so far ( Have only had it 3 days). It works with my contacts and allows me to use the contacts folder to send emails.  The only problem I had is that the Contacts application won't allow me to import distribution groups, but that isn't the fault of K-9 Mail.<br /><br />I would recommend this application to my friends.

B00A80SHFM|4.0|I got sucked into buying the \\"highlights\\" version for \\"Dreamgirls\\" when that first came out, then a few weeks later out came the complete soundtrack. I've been told by multiple people that the complete soundtrack for Les Mis will be out around the middle of January.

B0076DELIG|3.0|Sorry, but this was not up to MC's standard , in my view. Stuff just happens, but there are few surprises or Ah Ahs.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Even though I choked away the tears through the first sentence of chapter 21, it was worth it. This is the best book I read in 2012 and I'm hoping that l will soon get to be a reader of another fantastic book such as this one. My vocabulary has recently expanded as well being only a seventh grader. I would read this again any day.
0312360258|1.0|I can not say how thoroughly disappointed i am with this series. I have patiently read nine books in this dreadful series hoping for it to get better. To put this bluntly- it doesn't. I- as a teenager myself- find it to be ridiculous. Zoey, the main character and voice of the story, is lacking in personality and depth. She's everything to be expected in a main character- beautiful, moral, has parent problems, and she's \\"special\\". I didn't appreciate how her character came across. She's gets involved with so many guys at one time but always finds a way for it to be okay for her to do it and she's not sleezy.<br />Her friends especially annoyed me. They act like she is so amazing and they practically worship her and everything she does from the moment that she arrives at the House of Night with them. I would have liked to have seen some struggle to fit in like the authors tried to portray. At her old school she was dating the star quarter back and went to parties, which is definitely not something someone would do who was \\"struggling\\" to find a niche. Once being Marked she is able to take of the school's most illustrious club and date the most popular guy in the whole school, obviously another factor that points to her not having any struggle fitting in.<br />Also her use of vocabulary annoys me, \\"bull poopie?\\" Really? I found that to be unsettling. I have never once heard a teenager speak like that. i thought the purpose of the younger Cast was to bring a fresh take to this and not make it more ridiculous.<br /> The authors' constant slander toward Christianity and God was also very disrespectful. They try to paint people of the Christian faith to be judgmental, sexist, and not accepting of anyone else's beliefs. If you're religious i would definitely leave this book alone, it's blasphemous and cruel in that sense.<br />The only redeeming character in this entire series is Zoey's grandmother, other than that, i hate every aspect of these novels.Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I highly suggest for no one to waste time or money on this garbage.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love the gameplay and the new towers it is a lot of fun ! ! ! ! ! ! !! ! ! ! !

B003VANOFY|3.0|My son has had the wired version of this headset for a couple of years and really likes it.  I decided to get him this wireless version for Christmas and he really like the freedom of the wireless headset but it has a problem.  The microphone is very scratchy sounding and his friends complain that they cannot understand him.  I am going to return this one and order a new one and just hope it's a defect in this particular headset.
1451695195|5.0|I could not put this book down until I finished reading it. It is well written and among the most interesting NDE experiences I have read. I highly recommend this book for all, but especially those who do not believe in a life after this physical form.
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|As usual, lyrics are Dylan's strong point. Melodies weak but work for the limitations of his aging voice. Backup musicians superb.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|i bought this movie for 9.98 they should have paid me 9.98 to watch it !!!!not for family my advice keep your money and spend it on something else
0446554995|5.0|After 'Cold Vengeance' was a bit of a let down, Preston and Child have come roaring back with its sequel. You know when P and C are good; you can't put the book down and go to bed. Two Graves creates the same multilevel intrigue and excitement that can be found in Brimstone and Book of the Dead. Pendergast is back on form-hooray!
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|If I were able to completely suppress all my critical thinking skills and accept whatever is happening on the screen, perhaps this would have been an amusing movie for me, instead of a maddeningly frustrating one. But I am not able to do that.<br /><br />Can you accept the premise that a super-rich mogul would spend a \\"trillion dollars\\" to finance an expedition to an earth-like planet in search of ancient astronauts who might, just might, have been the parents of the human race? Fine. Then can you accept that for this trillion dollar mission they would pick the most unprofessional, unscientific, incautious staff who proceed to ignore every sound principle of archaeological investigation, lab quarantine, and common sense?<br /><br />If you can't accept supposedly educated, trained, technically skilled people doing one moronic and dangerous thing after another, then about halfway through this film you just might be fighting the urge to throw heavy objects at the screen, or bang your head against the wall.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you enjoy typical horror films where people, through their typically unthinking behavior, put themselves in greater and greater danger and end up running from said danger until they meet with dismemberment and death, this is the sci-fi equivalent.<br /><br />This is a blot on Ridley Scott's filmography. Also, the slipcover on the DVD claims that Roger Ebert rated this four stars and called it \\"magnificent.\\" If this is not an out-of-context quote, it is another sign that Roger Ebert's opinion is no longer of any use to the movie going public.<br /><br />The special effects are indeed magnificent. If that's all you're interested in, Prometheus is five-star material. For me, it fails to meet even the lowest standard of suspension-of-disbelief necessary to enjoy a proper science fiction film.
B0086700CM|5.0|Be warned - horribly addictive!!! Easy controls, great responsive graphics.  It is very difficult to put down because that &quot;one last game&quot; can quickly turn into twenty.

B00280LYIC|5.0|This book gave me more education in Greek mythology and its that kind of book that you don't want ever to end
B005H9B2CE|1.0|The story told doesn't match any myth I've ever heard of, but the tropes are extremely well known. The tripartite structure of the play; the \\"othering\\" of non-white, non-male characters; the good versus evil struggle; the obviousness of its ending. Verily, it's crammed with unexamined tropes of Hollywood. Why do gods always speak with a vaguely British accent? Why can there be just one female warrior? Why does the director shoot at women's faces to illustrate emotions that are being felt by the male leads around which all action centers? Because that's how it's done, that's why. Don't ask yourself why you've never heard this goofy mythology before. Ask yourself why any story, whether it's a classic or a dud, deserves such hackneyed treatment, and so expensively. CGI and pretty actors and sword fights on rainbow bridges through the cosmos, magic that is explained as science and looks just as awesome as what Arthur C. Clarke was talking about, don't come cheap.<br /><br />Perfect for enjoying while under the age of 13, or while really tired or drugged. Unwatchable by cultural critics.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love this app  tells me everything I need to know at sight.  one of those things that should be considered essential.  pretty, too.
1451638450|5.0|I had been anxiously awaiting the story of Ivan Vorpatril ever since he rescued Dono and helped Miles get his bride. Bujold has done a great job of settling Ivan with a plot that I found completely satisfying. This is worthy addition to the Vorkosigan Saga.
B0036T31YY|4.0|Wow they actually made something new & refreshing in horror!!! Great JOB!!! This is a very different kind of story & nothing is as it seems. Very Creepy & Mind bending!!!

B0035XVVDY|3.0|It's a decent distraction, nice to see Jamie Fox in something decent outside of Ray...The acting is pretty good, but the story has way too many plot holes.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Looking for something new to listen. It's time for Kelly Clarkson!! If you are a fan of Kelly Clarkson, you will not be sorry for getting this CD. I'm so happy for her, for coming out with all these great songs. Job well done!

B003SPCYP8|4.0|Don't be scared, give this movie a try. A very great film showing how it feels to be Muslim in a post 9/11 World...Finally a positive film about Muslims!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|It's good to hear a firsthand account of what happened over there. The writing style is easy to follow, and it was interesting to see how SEALs feel about life and their operations. I'm in the Navy, but I'm no SEAL. The things those guys do for their country amaze us regular squids all the time. It took real balls for this guy to write this book, and I truly appreciate that he did. Every American should read this, to know what these guys go through to take out these sick bastards that hate us so much. At least to show some respect. Oh, and while you're at it, go pick up Lone Survivor too...

B00APUYN0I|4.0|Good movie to watch as a family with our teenage daughters. Perfect timing with popularity of Glee. Loved Rebel Wilson!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The author did a great job of researching the many different sources of information. I was curious about the relationship which William Stoddard had with the president.  She really didn't shed much light on his part.  I wondered about this because in my research about my family tree, I found that I might be distantly related to this person.  I wanted to see if it may be true.  I'll have to keep searching I suppose. I recommend the reading of this book - thanks. D.E. Young
0982954352|5.0|An inexpensive gift for everyone.<br />Even if you have seen every movie this is much better!<br />Keep a few on hand to put on house guests night stands.

B003UBTX6S|4.0|Although I don't think that this book was as good as the first one, it was still fun to read. Lena is very unlikeable at times in this book, and some things get a little overly drawn out at times, BUT if you enjoyed the first book this one is worth a read.

B009MF56GC|1.0|It's basically Twilight for redneck good ol' boys. I can't believe all the good reviews people are leaving. No wonder hollywood makes so many crap films these days. The mindless masses are actually willing to pay for this drivel.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|this was a perfect gift for my dad for Christmas.  He was so shocked and loved it.  It came fast and in perfect condition.
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|Always loved this one. Bought it for another grandson and his siblings.  They loved it.  It is timeless and kids can relate to it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Back and forth chapters between husband and wife.  Facts left out until later to hold interest.  Book somewhat too long.  Strange ending after spending time reading 400+ pages.  Glad I borrowed it from library and didn't spend money on it.  I don't understand all the hoopla about it honestly.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Loved it can't wait for the next one to read. Great author and story. Really kept my interest and left me wanting more.

0486290492|5.0|It took me a lot longer to finish up Sense and Sensibility than it really should have. There are several reasons for this and not one of those reasons is that the book is not very good or engaging- in fact, it is monstrous both. The school year started back up for me on Wednesday which took a lot of wind out of my sails and a lot of reading time out of my days. About a week before I decided to participate in the Austen in August reading even over at Roof Beam Reader's site I had purchased a copy of the Masterpiece Theatre/BBC version of Sense & Sensibility. I simultaneously watched the episodes while reading the book. I believe that this helped me to get a visual of what was going on as well as assisted in deciphering the prose of the time that the book was written in. I had seen this version a few times on PBS and I loved it very much so there were no spoilers for me, though it would have been nice to not know that Willoughby was such a scoundrel and that Elinor was going to marry Edward after all.<br /><br />Mmmmm.... Edward Ferrars....<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensly, and I am almost ashamed to write this, but it is the truth and I'm striving to be more like Elinor in my life, which in one respect is to say more honest and so I must confess: I prefer the movie version better (the Masterpiece version, as I have not seen the Ang Lee version, yet.).  I truly believe I prefer the screen version over the print because it was my first involvement with the story of the sisters Dashwood. If I had read the book first, I surely would prefer it.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this story is the fact that I could have easily been Marianne (or to a lesser degree, Elinor). Even in the 1800′s in England, girls still fancied boys who are jerks and girls still had a tendency to slight the good guys! When it comes to the opposite sex I have made numerous mistakes in my years of dating. I tend to choose the Willoughby over the Colonel Brandon and then rue the wasted timeand the heartbreak caused by my own dumb choice. So, I didn't feel as embarassed and I didn't cringe as much regarding my past mistakes in dudes since Marianne was doing the exact same thing I did at her age: impulsively falling in love, flaunting it all over town, ignoring common sense, getting the short end of the gossip stick, you know, just basically acting in love and then getting dumped for the rich (in modern language: popular) girl and mooning over it for months. However, one part made me feel a little old maid-ish and a little pissed off-ish at Marianne:<br /><br />\\" `A woman of seven and twenty' \\" (Egads, I am 27 years old!) \\"said Marianne, after pausing a moment, `can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small\\" (very small, I work in public education), \\"I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.'\\" Gulp!<br /><br />I love Marianne because she is me, but my favorite characters were definitely Elinor and Mrs. Jennings. These two women are as opposite as night and day but I love them both for who they are. Elinor is so reserved and calm and cool and collected and everything that I just am not but that I strive to be. I love her for always keeping her cool and never going nuts and silently suffering heartbreak for MONTHS just to spare her sister and her mother from feeling heartbreak for her. If I'm heartbroken, I'm taking out a billboard and begging for sympathy and pity. Now, Mrs. Jennings, she is a hoot and a holler!! This is a sassy, brash little old lady that I pictured as Sophia Petrillo from the Golden Girls!<br /><br />The brashness, the sauciness, the rudeness, the likability of these two ladies is what makes them the bitchin' characters that they are. Neither of these ladies is afraid to lay on the innuendo and offend those around them, especially when it comes to relations! In addition to the talent of genuinely writing two such different characters that both become so love-able and appreciated and necessary to the rest of the story and the other characters, Austen also portrayed my favorite kind of character: the strong female. In an age of weaklings (see Bella Swan in Twilight) I am of the opinion that showing female characters, especially in this time when so much of their worth was dependent on the men in their lives. Austen blows that out of the water, and as the case with Willoughby shows, the MEN sometimes must be dependent on the WOMEN for money and status! Hu-zahhh Ms. Austen, Huzzah! Though each of her female characters are bad-ass women (even the deplorable Fanny- she knows how to turn John Dashwoods head and get EXACTLY what she wants, when she wants it, and how she wants it) they still find classy ways to tell each other to get bent, especially Elinor when dealing with that despicable Lucy Steele. This is what all women in every country and in all times should aim to be like and I am so thankful when I see these types of characters in books. So, thank you Jane for writing these characters into your works, and like Sophia would say, thank you for being a friend!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|So far pretty cool. I like the mystery and story plot. Looks like a lot of fun and lots to do. I would recommend this game to everyone. This one is a lot better than some others that I got.
0545265355|4.0|In the spring of 2009 I arrived early to a class on The History of the Book. I always arrive early. To class. To work. To anything, really. I got there to pull out my Harry Potter that I was currently reading and found that for the first time in a long time there was someone who had arrived before me to class. She was a girl that I had had a few classes with and I knew her well enough to strike up a conversation. The Library Science program is small enough at UNCG that everyone knows everyone else and what they are doing at any given time. So, I asked her what she was obviously so engrossed in reading. This girl worked at the on campus Teaching and Resource Center that provided materials to those who may be seeking a degree in K-12 education. They got in tons of YA and children's books and those that worked there got to read them before anyone else did (jealous).<br /><br />The book that she was so into, she told me, was called The Hunger Games. She proceeded to give me the gist of what was going on in the plot up to where she was reading. It sounded just plain awesome. Cut to Fall 2010 when I am working in my first real, full-time, library job. I get some cash to order some books for the library and one of the books I pick is The Hunger Games. I will admit that one of the main reasons that I purchased this specific book was because I had been wanting to read it for so long. So, when the order arrived in November I took the book home with me for the weekend where I proceeded to do nothing but lay on my parents couch and read the whole book. It was just that good!<br /><br />What I adored about this YA novel was how strong the main character was. Katniss Everdeen lives in a futuristic world in which the districts are ruled by an evil Capitol who forces two children \\"tributes\\" to play in an annual Hunger Games. During the games the children (one boy, one girl) are thrust into a thematic environment and forced to kill each other off until only one survives. When Katniss's younger sister, Prim, is called forth to be District 12′s tribute Katniss immediately jumps to take her place. Katniss is a powerful female protagonist which I think that YA literature has been missing lately. The first comparison that comes to mind is Isabella (Bella) Swan in Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series. Now, I want to say that I adore Twilight, like it or not, I do. I am in line at midnight for the opening of each movie and I've devoured the books and I loved them before they became pop culture phenoms. However, my one major complaint with that series was how weak and Edward-obsessed Bella was. As soon as she met the vamp, she lost all ability to think for herself and to consider her own dreams for the future. Everything became about a man (undead, but still) and she was willing to die for him. Katniss Everdeen is the anti-Bella Swan and that is exactly why I love her. Like in the quote I chose, she does NOT have time for kissing, this girls got more important things to think of, like leading rebellions, fighting wars, surviving, providing for her family, and taking care of everyone around her.<br /><br />I know, I know I know. You can't really have a YA novel without a little romance now can you? Enter Gale and Peeta- the two young lads who are vying for Miss Everdeens affections. Gale is the friend that Katniss has hunted with since Katniss's father died in a mining accident. Gale is that first love, childhood friend character that the reader just roots for to win. Peeta is the artistic and articulate son of a local D12 baker. Peeta is the male tribute opposite Katniss. You see where that leads, right? Katniss must either kill Peeta or be killed by him. I won't ruin the books for those of you who may have never read them, but Peeta AND Katniss are both in all three books. As is Gale. Triangle much?!<br /><br />The love story is not the  main theme of the book though. It's not just juvenile sappy romance. It's about survival in the most chaotic, frightening, and evil of times. Children are killing children in gruesome ways here. The death scenes are amazing and creative. Katniss is a hunter, as I mentioned earlier. She has an acute ability to hit any target be it moving or still, human or not. The fact that this young teen girl has to provide for her poor mother and sister and does so without hesitation is what young girls should be reading about. They should be reading how a girl can beat the boys in something as fierce as a hunger game (spoiler: not once, but TWICE!). They need to be reading that boys are not the be all and end all of life. They need to know that they can all be a kind of Katniss and beat the boys and be in control of their own lives and survival. Are you reading this, Bella and Stephenie? I sure hope so!<br /><br />My one complaint was completely about the last book. It didn't read like the first two did. And perhaps this is because this is the only book in the trilogy that does not have a Hunger Games in it. This book felt rushed somehow to me, as if Collins was under an intense deadline to get this book written. It didn't have the same feeling as the first two. I wasn't as compelled to read this one. This one was more somber in tone. This one was about nothing but straight up war and revenge. There is an epilogue at the end of this novel that I could have so done without. We find out which suitor Katniss ends up with and what becomes of them. I don't want to spoil anything, again for those of you who may not have read it all yet, but the future that Katniss has is not one that I envisioned for her. Reading the epilogue and how Katniss talks about her future, I also get the feeling that this is not a future that she envisioned for herself. I wanted Katniss to be out of the games and out of the control of the district and happy. I didn't get the feeling that she was very happy. I would have rather had the book end open-ended so that readers could envision their own futures of happiness and hunting for Katniss.<br /><br />This review was originally published at bookjackets.wordpress.com

B00A2IUDO8|4.0|I missed TED during its original theatrical run, but I'm glad I finally got to watch it as a rental -- this is a movie I'll definitely buy on Blu-ray or DVD for the permanent collection.  I'm not a huge fan of FAMILY GUY and other Seth MacFarlane productions -- he's *way* too hit-or-miss, IMHO -- but he got things *really* right with TED.<br /><br />There were moments during this movie that had me laughing so hard I couldn't breathe or see through the tears in my eyes.  Furthermore, anyone who was in grade school at the time FLASH GORDON: THE MOVIE came out in the late 1970s/early 1980s (and loved it, un-ironically!) will *treasure* TED for reasons I won't go into any further here (but trust me -- for those reasons alone, this movie is worth watching).<br /><br />This might not've been a home run in any other ballpark, but in Fenway Park with its short left field, MacFarlane hits a home over the Monster.  :-)
B00A861QMM|5.0|Loved what I played. Di not like to have to purchase to play rest.  Would prefer told up front that only part of game is free to play.
B009VB97EY|1.0|This was a sorry movie - if they couldn't say f@#% and s*&? there would be very little dialogue.  Didn't expect it to be intellectual or uplifting but at least expected entertaining and it wasn't.
B007N85POS|5.0|grandkids love it.The oldest can get to the levels but poor grandma has a hard time. makes the kids think
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. It's a classic and always will be.  One of my favorite features is being able to customize the card and the background; it adds nicely to the fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much better than temple run my younger doesn't agree he says temple run is the best running from big things games. I just wish they make something to disable my Facebook's friends scores in the top right corner<br /> over all its great runs fine as well
B007X16GFC|2.0|Watch Shooter instead. It has a better plot line and story. This story line dragged out and became too predictable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! Very well written and not your typical love story. Didn't expect the little twist at the end. If you're not a Nicholas Sparks fan then you will be after reading this book.
B00AMBLDEE|2.0|It was okay. It does try to set the stage for a new thread of stories, but I was disappointed that it seemed to drag on many times.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|have always enjoyed conan doyle as an author and loved getting all this for my reader at such a good price.
B004F1F32A|5.0|As a Dad, it is a very scary movie to watch, but it is action-packed and thrilling. You find yourself on the edge of your seat hoping that it will all turn out okay. Well worth a watch!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app and Pinterest!  This app makes pinning from my Kindle do much easier.  If you have a Kindle and Pinterest you must have this app.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I had actually picked up this book at local bookshop before and decided then against buying it; It was not before I saw the trailer of the upcoming movie -based on this book - that I finally ordered the &#34;World War Z&#34;. I am happy I did.<br />During the recent years zobies have become popular in movies, games, books - you name it. While I enjoy a good &#34;Z&#34; movie or book one is starting to get a bit fed up with this topic.<br />So I must say that Max Brooks' approach was a refreshing one - the book is kind of scrap book that features interviews of various characters that have participated to the WW &#34;Z&#34; . First I thought that this might result in loose and unconnected story - however this is not the case. Instead Mr Brooks succeeds in creating a vivid and credible cronology of the events that nearly exterminates the human race.<br />Highly recommended.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|So happy to know this was based on a true story.  It's a great example of true love and committment no matter the situation.
B004HGBUVG|5.0|I have loved her songs since the day I first heard her. This recording offers something special, the same songs two ways. The way they are recorded in the studio and the raw songs recorded in her kitchen. I have a hard time deciding which I like best. They are different and wonderful in their own way.
B008JEJVXG|5.0|How can a album make me this nostalgic for the best of the '80s yet feel so fresh ? If this had been released back then they would have stolen a lot of \\"in touch\\" fans from the Smiths, Cure, and Breathless. A melancholy sound that makes you feel good. One of my favorite albums of the year.
1932735410|5.0|PMBOK is simply not enough to pass. This book will let you to prepare even if you have limited practical experience of PM
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So funny. Interesting insights and the great,specific humor you expect from Tina Fey. If you like her in general, you will love Bossypants.
B006YXTRHY|1.0|We were ready to shut it off 28 minutes in, but gave it the benefit of the doubt.  i probably won't even bother with part 2.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Loved this movie in the theater.<br />Gave it as a xmas gift to a teenager.<br />She loved it.  Yay!<br />Mission accomplished.
B0045XICB2|1.0|I had to get a case of Rainier to get through this movie.  I figured if Bellas dad had to drink tallboys to get through it, my friend and i would need a case.  We were very correct.
B0051OZ564|1.0|I would rather just give it one star and move on; I've already suffered enough for this movie.  300 was a crowd pleaser so I organized a group of friends to all go see this, his follow-up. I'm still apologizing.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|I absolutely loved this book/series. I fell in love with each character and just overall really enjoyed reading it. When I was done with all three books, I was left wanting more.<br /><br />I felt the same about this awesome book that I just completely fell in love with and everything about it - The Star-Crossed Series by Rachel Higginson. The first book, Reckless Magic, can be found here [[ASIN:B004S7EUJ8 Reckless Magic (The Star-Crossed Series, Book 1)]]<br /><br />You will NOT be disappointed!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great Read. Typical Clancy a fast start and then once you complete the learning process, off you go it's real
B003SNKBXW|1.0|The novel in itself is fine, and I would probably rate it a 3.5 stars.  It is a book lover's book, clever in places, somewhat self-satisfied (and then lengthy) in others. Two recommendations:<br />- read the book first, see the movie after<br />- avoid the e-book like the plague. I can see that given the book's number of languages and the abbreviations they had to disable the spell check for the OCR to work at all, but the result would have needed significant manual correction before being released on an an unsuspecting public. Try to look for &#34;Paris&#34; among the many &#34;Pan&#34;'s (?!?) or the &#34;rain&#34; in the many &#34;ram&#34;'s. Once or twice, hey, life ain't perfect, but this is a mess.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This was a true picture on what our men in the Pacific went through.  Very graphic!  It's a series that would be watched once.than once.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I'm not a computer geek, but if all the info in this novel is true it's just amazing how hackers can get into your system especially if they have unlimited resources like the PRC would have.  Really enjoyed the book & couldn't put it down.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Perfect calculator fro the simple applications used in balancing your checkbooks.  Easy to use.  A nice addition to my Kindle Fire HD.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I know I'm going to enjoy these books.  Loved the shows and books are always better.  Love the convenience of reading on my Kindle.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!! 15 min. ONLY! that's tottaly messed up wow give me like a half hour here! but other than that its really fun
B003V9OCS8|5.0|Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Everyone who watched it found it intense. Wish it did not have a sad ending.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the. game is great it took a while to carch on but now i m hooked looking forward to exploring new rooms
B004QOB8SO|5.0|This is what television was meant to be: artfully scripted, impeccably acted, both faithful to the original and also breaking new ground.  Unlike American detective stories which focus on weapons and muscle, this is a cerebral detective story at its best.<br />My guess is I'll enjoy watching it the 10th time as much as I did the first time---as a blessed relief from grading finals.
B0054R6BFM|4.0|This book is interesting.  I like the way it is written and think that it is an interesting topic since bullying is such a big topic now days.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it. Great picture, great game. Everyone should download this! You can change the look of your deck of cards too.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I don't find it very interesting. This game is not for me.Just not exciting for me .It's boring. Don't like it.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|After years of wanting to finish this book, I finally did and it was so good! Makes me appreciate life a little more too.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Good book really good book you will be amazed with it it is a super duper duper  duper really good book
B005K17RU0|5.0|It covers most of the weather sites I was interested in having available quickly and accurately, much better than other sites I have tried...
B004LWZWGK|5.0|We love Christopher Nolan movies (well, just this one, Inception, and the Dark Knight.) This movie reminds us of the Dark Knight (vs. Batman Begins.) Although it's not as good of a movie, overall it is thrilling, action-packed, and has a really good ending. It's a movie that you can continue to watch over and over again, with each time being able to pick up something new from it.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|fun game to play.  Granddaughter asked for this app and played it for hours.  Kept her busy and entertaining for her
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book was suspenseful until the last 1/2. It took a turn that was predictable then unpredictable and went totally out there. Was completely disappointed.
B004FS27JK|5.0|This Album brought back all of my childhood and teenage memories of listening to and watching Whitney Houston as one my favorites ever and one of the best singers with an amazing voice ever !!!!!  It just makes you smile listening to this Album and remembering a Music Legend...................
0316228532|1.0|I read a lot.  I couldn't finish this book - it was extremely dull and gratuitously filthy. Frankly, if the author wasn't already famous, this would be a non-starter.  I tried, really, but finally happily put it down about one-third through with complete lack of interest.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Every author tends to deal with a sophomore slump, and while this is technically Miss Rowling 's 9th book, she's spent all her time in one universe that the jump to a brand new one is a little shakey at first. This story really does seem like it's The Dursley's own book, everyone is a tad boring in that charmingly English way. The best review I can give this book is that I had to finish it,for good or I'll I had to finish
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I don't use facebook very often but it is nice to have it available while traveling, so I can see what is going on with family.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|The LEGO Super Hero series of toys are great for little boys and their imaginations! Easy to assemble which allows childrend to learn how to be independent.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I have not used it much yet but as I get better at my new toy I feel that this will come in handy while traveling and going to new places.
B005KELW26|5.0|This was ordered for my daughter for Christmas and she was very happy with color and make.  Fit Kindle<br />Fire perfectly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play and fun. The advertisement before each game is anoying but the app was free. Would recommend to others.
B009P5K4HK|4.0|This album features a few songs I hadn't heard before, and the sound quality on the live tracks is extremely good. And of course, the vocal performance is stunning.
B0000029DD|4.0|and my son loved it!  I was so glad that I was able to find it and get it shipped in time for Christmas.
B0076XIS4O|4.0|Great sound, the vocals are whispy and gorgeous, perfect for relaxing and chilling. Definitely lives up to all the hype.
B0098Z64US|5.0|I had to wait a couple of extra weeks to get the deluxe edition.  But waiting for a new David Garrett album is a necessary pain!  The tracks are varied, and each has his special twist.  I never get tired of listening to it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Works great everyone will have one, why wasn't it available on the kindel in the first place, at leats it was free
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Not As Good as 1 & 2 I'm glad I did not see this in the movies and waste my money
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes of the movie, before we decided to turn it off.  The language in this movie is absolutely ridiculous!
0553801473|5.0|The book is awesome.<br />Hope the author doesn't die before he finishes the series.<br />If you haven't read the previous books be warned that a lot of the characters that you will fall in love will be killed, Horribly. I nearly stopped reading the series after one of mine was killed.<br />lots of plots, counterplots, and twists to keep you guessing.<br />I personally liked Harry Potter and Twilight series and find this series to be probably even better, just not for children.<br />Definite Recommend
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|Film works on many fronts; there's something about Tom Hardy that's hard to pin point. It's all acting and make belief but one can't help by being immersed in the rawness. I appreciate when several story strings are interwoven and tie in together at the end. Nothing complex but again, it works.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Cromwell does it again! She continues to keep me on the edge of my seat. Another thrilling Scarpetta novel. Hopefully, another one will be out soon....
B005P1YCNK|5.0|Fabulous book!  The lessons and ideas can be applied to any area of life you're working to change or improve.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Great movie for the kids in the family,,, best for the GIRLS, to booster there minds and make them BRAVER to face todays world!!
B000AGTPUU|5.0|It is a wonderful movie.  It capures the essence of the Christmas spirit and Christmas magic that children need.  Believing.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I have all  the Resident Evil movies and this one is as good as the first one. Lots of GREAT ACTIONS with the ZOMBIES!!!!!
B0083I90HU|5.0|The structure of this story is incredible.  The story itself is a familiar and sad account of the holocaust and the impact it had on one particular family.  De Rosnay evokes a high degree of emotion for the reader by connecting the lives of the characters from the past with those in present day.  It can be a tear jerker.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I saw this movie at theater and it was amazing, I have the first dvd, but to own this one will blow your socks off ,with unseen parts!!!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game will definitely keep you occupied, it is very addictive. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys playing cooking games. Its truly worth the money.
B005LAII3A|4.0|Recall the first and times it by 10x. Action ,Adventure,and a lot of kick butt.We found this movie most enjoible at time!!!!!!!!!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|My daughter and I both downloaded this game on our s3s. We have been playing it all day. Very addictive.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|If you have a Batman movie , than you should have this one too!! It will BLOW your mind. Lots of GREAT ACTION!
B009PNQUXO|1.0|it's ok but personally I don't like it you might but I dont like it at all one bit so I hate it
B005GFPZYK|5.0|One bad ass SEAL. Thank you for being our warrior, Chief Kyle. An excellent read. Honest and insightful. Your first-hand accounts in combat were incredible.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I love the book if you like easy books this is a good game for you I l love it you should really really test it out
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Very entertaining but for Adults only, thus the &#34;R&#34; rating.<br /><br />Lots of wonderful stars, great music, and timeless.<br /><br />Good Fun!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|not only does the game not save the money you work so hard for but the joystick freezes.. during gameplay! there r limited amount of guns and the sniper classes are completly useles. ive never seen a sniper get nerfed this bad in my life its sickening. if u dont update anything ever again update the money scamming craps everyones loseing hard earned cash i lost over 70k and hhours of my life. otherwise the games pretty epic. also add a kick option for the  loser hackers<br />and WHEN you fix this money issuse everyone deserves 150k. we pay good money for fun that we are partially recievingrecieving. i cant even kill anyone cause i dont have money to upgrade guns
B008Z9L94O|1.0|The sound near the inner grooves is godawful.  It's a nice $80 mantle piece.  That's about all it's good for.  Pass on this one, trust me.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Talking Ben is to much fun I tell u.U can slap him back and forth he won't care at all. U say something to Ben he says it back.Go in his lab and u can make some potions with Ben.Touch Ben's tummy his eyes pop out.Also touch his picture it breaks in pieces..
B006LSZECO|3.0|I haven't finished the book yet so I don't think I can give it a proper review.  When I finish it I will be happy to give it a proper review.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Clint Eastwood always seems to make a great film. Hope he stays at it for a long time to come
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book just kept throwing the unexpected with every next entry and you can completely fall for the characters and feel their emotions throughout the whole book.
B000CDIOYO|4.0|Overall I was very happy.  The soprano voice was very beautiful and she actually smiled.  I don't know how the narrating tenor could be so precise and good.  The director was quite good and I liked his interpretation.<br />I was not happy with the bass and one of the tenor's singing.  It was out of tune.  The singer portraying Jesus was not convincing to me.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Great read.. Not my usual Choice of subject but had to read it as everyone else was!.. Only downside was I read in three sittings.. Not long enough!<br />Definitely recommend
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci  continues to write the BEST novels of this genre. I continue to be amazed by his imagination and writing skill. I especially appreciate his ability to include human relationships, including sexual intimacy, without being vulgar, to engage the reader into the lives of his characters.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|One episode of Glee is better. The singing is just average and that's why I watched it. The storyline is predictable. But there are a few funny moments.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I love this app. I love it because it helps if you are stuck it can teleport you back to spawn.  it can give you items in case you can not find any.
B00004W510|5.0|The Band was truly original and each member was a great musician, no wonder they performed so well on stage.  This album, recorded in makeshift studios with great production, exemplifies the true spirit and mood of the Band.
B0020VKZ4I|5.0|love this one.  got me on the krall kick.  real music kids for the young an old.  buy this one

B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it is a funny book.<br />Also this book isn't just for boys or girls.<br />Don't forget that this is a great  book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book by an American hero. He was just doing his job. Great reading.. couldn't put it down.<br />Thank you Mr. Kyle for your service.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my wife and she is enjoying it very much, having only see some of the previous segments.

B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great and a must have to get dolphin browers for kindle fire hd, so you can use adobe flash player.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Super entertaining and just the right amount of difficulty. The graphics are fun and smooth and the game play provides  a satisfying ballgame. Also, the Facebook page provides great tips when stuck.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Didn't like it was not very accurate on my  kindle fire hd<br />Got another program and it works a lot better
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|As a gift for my dad you went through a 16 pack of AA Batteries a month, it was totally worth it. Great look and convenience. Sits at the base of the iMac and just blends in. Very satisfied with my purchase.
B00845PRDS|5.0|Great movie. Makes me realize just how Evil these enemies are.<br />The sooner people realize this this the better off we will be.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Yes I said that the 11th. Doctor Matt Smith was the BEST Doctor Who. BUT after watching David Tennant in series 4 well It's too close to call. The man is really a magnificant actor. And you all voted Catherine Tate as the BEST companion. So as of this point due to the companion I'm forced to give David a razor's edge. And the episodes End Of Time were works of pure art. It's hard for science fiction to get mainstream respect because many sci/fy productions lack emotions. Well BOTH David & Matt score A+ in my book in range of emotions. Add series 4 to your collection too.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|No thanks to Adobe for NO flash player for the knidle fire hd. I had to download this browser. I t works fine<br />And runs good on the kindle fire hd.
B008FQ1O1K|2.0|A clever idea to give Father Time a character and story but, for me, wasted by turning it into a simplistic morality tale where two self centred people learn the obvious lesson that is not about you and your delusions.  Imagine what could have been done with this concept if it had explored how not only the measurement but also the theories of time have developed over human history.  Nothing wrong with this book, and I have friends who love it, but I would have preferred not to have been handed the ending  but to have had the option of thinking through some of the dllemmas posed by the fourth dimension.
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|Eastwood was great as usual. Hatred the way it ended. But still a great movie.<br />Acting was good by everyone.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Ms. Goodwin can certainly weave a good story...very interesting approach to getting the facts out there.  I'd recommend this to every history buff or those who just &#34;love a good book&#34;!  Loved it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love the book. I think that it had the right amount of romance, sadness and danger. The plot was amazing and she brilliantly wrote the Hunger Games. I think that anyone ranging from teenagers to older adults would love it. The Hunger Games is totally appropriate for anyone, my mom, my brother,my older friend and I read the series and we all adored them! The Hunger Games are my second favorite book series (and I have read a LOT of books)! You are going to fall in love with the Hunger Games again and again.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Love it! But it's addictive!!! I really enjoy playing when I have free time!!! So glad I got this app would recommend it to anyone who loves spider solitaire!
B007SGM084|4.0|I gave it 4 stars because I liked the story. It was entertaining, and would still have without a sexapade every other page. That was my only complaint about the story.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|My friend introduced me to this fabulous little tool for uploading pics right to your iPad from your memory stick taking out the camera/adapter/computer step!!! Wow!!! What a convenience!!! If you like instant gratification of seeing your pics, then you won't be sorry w/this purchase!!! Enjoy!!! Cheers!!! :-)
0143122061|2.0|Early on, Niall Ferguson provides an outline: \\"what distinguished the West from the Rest - the mainsprings of global power - were six identifiably novel complexes of institutions and associated ideas and behaviours....<br />1. Competition<br />2. Science<br />3. Property Rights<br />4. Medicine<br />5. The Consumer Society<br />6. The Work ethic\\" (p. 12)<br />Unfortunately, I did not find this work sufficiently readable to get any further than 75 pages. In those few pages, I did find myself disagreeing with routes which the author was taking.<br /><br />Eminently more readable is [[ASIN:1596983280 Thomas Woods]], as well as [[ASIN:0345373162 Charles Van Doren]] to a lesser extent
0142501123|5.0|Every little kid recognizes this book already.  Great pictures, fun story and predictable rhymes.<br />Good for early readers.  They'll soon be reading it to you.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I like the game but it freezes if I am connected to the internet. It would also be a better game if all the good stuff didn't cost diamonds which you have to buy with real money.
0446567337|5.0|It took this man years to feel the type of love for himself or someone else.  With the love of his father.

0446618322|5.0|True love sometimes takes a long path.  But sometimes that is what it takes.  I really recommend this book to read.
0060574216|5.0|I'm a 65-year-old woman and have been married all my adult life. There are aspects of the way that my husband acts that I've impatient with for years. I never realized until reading this book that these were characteristic behaviors unique to men but not at all unique to my husband. For example, the disinclination to talk about what is upsetting him and his enthusiastic (and unwelcome) jumping in to help solve my problem when I have one. &#34;Men Are From Mars and Women Are from Venus&#34; identifies gender differences and makes them understandable. It also provides workable steps to address these issues. This book has a fun read and helped me to improve my marriage.
B000085RPU|1.0|I loved this movie that's why I ordered it.  But it won't play in our player, it says something about a code.
B0070ZLZ1G|3.0|Interesting book, but has some major flaws, both in the writing and the message. In one word- disappointing.<br />The big, important takeaway is the need to redesign what we teach and what we prize in our developing children, and the notion that valuable life skills are indeed teachable.<br />In reality, this book is a data dump of whatever the author wanted to write about with a thin thread of the importance character in the development of successful adults going through it. The message could have been powerful but it was weakly supported and not at all driven home. The book too many flaws for me to recommend it to anyone I like:<br />1-The portion on chess is random, long, boring and never ties back to the importance of character in a successful life. Are chess masters happy and fulfilled? Do they contribute to society? Are they successful at anything else?<br />2-There's much more retrospective evidence presented than actual employable techniques that work. Of the few techniques mentioned, none have been actually proven successful. What can individual parents and teachers do? The book really left me hanging here.<br />3-None of the ideas here are new. NurtureShock presented most of them much more clearly and in a more digestible language.<br />4-It simply fails to prove that kids who were raised in a certain way are indeed more fulfilled, successful and of higher value to society.<br />5-It includes random rants and heavy opinions that are unsubstantiated and unclaimed as opinions.

B00005JPS6|5.0|My wife and I love this movie.  Now our one year old loves it too.  He watches on his portable dvd player.  It never fails to make him laugh.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This really is an nice game and it is filed with fun. I love this game because those little monsters speak gibberish.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|When I first saw the trailer, before it's release.  I thought, what is Pixar up to?  They always come through with a beautifully animated, well executed story.  I Love this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book kept me reading. I recommend it to anyone who likes a good love story and makes your jaw drop.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Robots is soo beautiful to watch.  I love Robin Williams and Ewan McGregor.  I can watch this movie over and over and not get bored with it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I really wasn't one of Phillip Phillips fans when he was on American Idol. In fact I voted for someone else on the final, but this collection is better than I ever expected from him. When he was on American Idol he reminded me so much of another well known performer that I kept comparing him to that other artist in my mind. His range was a problem for me, but here his music has a life of it's own and his range isn't an issue.I still think his range is limited but the way he expresses his music here proves I was wrong about his talent and he deserves a spotlight on his work.<br /><br />On this collection of songs he shows a diversity I didn't expect from him and most of if not all of the songs are a welcome addition to my collection.<br /><br />Over all I found this collection of material to be fresh, with a sound more akin to Alt-Rock than Pop but this is one persons opinion so take this for what it's worth. I honestly feel that at this price you really cannot go wrong with this purchase and it's a great way to see if you would want to follow him or his material in the future. So far I'm sold and will probably purchase future releases. The clips you hear on Amazon give you just a taste of this recording and if you like what you hear you will not be disappointed.
B00003CXRM|5.0|No matter how many times I watch this movie, I still Laugh Out Loud!  This movie is a classic.  Glad I finally purchased.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Suspenseful, enlightening, Well written script. This movie keeps one wondering if this can truly happening real life.  It's an eye opening reminder to be guarded while traveling. Great acting.
B000002J1U|5.0|Yes, yes I would recommend this. Why? Hmm... Let's see: Immigrant Song, Celebration Day, Since I've Been Loving You, Gallows Pole, Tangerine, That's The Way, and Bron-Y-Aur Stomp seem to be rather persuasive. If you like music when the good stuff was still coming out, and you don't already have this, you should consider it... Or at least go to youtube to check these songs out... Of course for the tone deaf, and those who have no clue what good music is, there is always some s*** out there, like justine fkn beiber, and all that waste of air play known as s***, I mean pop...<br /><br />(Come on people it's all subjective, grow some skin, and possibly a spine before getting all bent over about my opinion)
0761171703|5.0|I have not given it to the person I bought it for yet, so it has not been taken from the shrink-wrap. Looks wonderful, though.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|After seeing previews of the movie, it seemed like it would be a very interesting and exciting book, It took a few chapters to get into the book. It started getting interesting when I got to the chapter that started the story of his journey in the life boat.
B000002PCS|5.0|Heard this quite a few years ago...along with the sound track from Out of Africa. A perfect twosome...lovely, lilting romantic music.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|This show is excellent! It's a drama and a thriller.  Probably the best show on TV, and buying it on amazon avoids having to have a Showtime subscription.  Just try not to watch all the episodes at once.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I'm not a fan of musicals, but I did catch Les Miserables and The Phantom of the Opera when I visited New York City back in 2001. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed this one the most. The music was great and the story, while quite depressing, was well done.<br /><br />The big screen version did not let me down. Anne Hathaway is only in the movie maybe 15 minutes, but she steals the show. Her singing of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" in one take is almost too powerful. Her acting in this scene alone adds layers that the stage production could never achieve. Hugh Jackman makes a wonderful Jean Valjean and Russel Crowe has the presence of a good Javert, but he is the weakest singer in the cast. Not as bad as I had heard, so he was really better than I expected. All of the singing was done live while filming, so it's brave, but maybe the wrong choice for Mr. Crowe. Great visuals round out a film that no theater lover should miss.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is breathtaking, riveting, and will keep you on edge long after you have finished reading.  I love this book.
B00849CADE|3.0|I bought this and a Spanish / English dictionary for my Kindle fire thinking I could use the dictionary function like I do with the other Kindle books.<br /><br />Kindle fire doesn't allow you to switch dictionaries.  Rats.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy the game as a wind down before bed.  Easy to play.  I like the fact I only have to touch the card and it automatically moves it.  Fun to play.
0689815816|5.0|I ordered this for my granddaughter for Christmas.  So cute and it brought back such good memories of doing this with my own daughters.  It's small for small hands and a sturdy board book.
0452295548|4.0|It is great way to understand a stroke, the time and tips for recovery.  Oh 4 more words are required for this review.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of those games you just can't put down!  Fun for any age, great visual colors, and totally addictive!  A must have for your mobile devices.
B008B68IEA|5.0|This bed was more awesome in person. When it arrived it was 30 degrees outside so my little girl thought it was really supposed to be cold...perfect timing. Easy to put together too.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Bought these books, Only Time Will Tell and Sins of the Father, as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in law who reads as much as I do!  Also gave my sister the first book and she's going to get the second one.<br />Got \\"into the wild\\" for my son  since I'd enjoyed that one alot.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I had no idea he sang all these songs. I had to buy this. It's a great cd, my young girls really like it too.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I typically enjoy sci-fi and odd/original movies, and I thought this movie fit this category but I was wrong. Very slow, and from the beginning you keep asking yourself, &#34;should I just turn it off?&#34; The answer is yes. Wait until it's free to watch, for maybe a select few will enjoy this film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me wanting more couldn't put it down definitely one of the best I've read in quite some time. One word great
0060825219|4.0|Paulo is a truly gifted writer that helps us all to think outside the box.  I enjoyed this book and read it very quickly.  I finished the book in a few days.
B00304RMFE|5.0|my son has watched this a few times and wanted it as part of his collection. I cannot comment on it really as I have not seen it,
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I started watching this show during the 2nd season and fell in love with the characters and the writing.  So I purchased the first season for my 2 sons, my husband and my sister.  And all love it.
B001KZG99A|5.0|however this is one of those super hero movies that little boys love and will watch over and over. purchased as a gift for my 11 year old son.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so much more funner then temple run and ummm I'm speechless so yep love this game
B00003CXIP|5.0|my husband likes to quote from Movies and this is one of them. we both remember it from our childhoods and wanted to share it with our kids. a story about being 12, two days out of a life adventure and heartache.I highly recommend it for anyone that wants to teach thier kids about friendship.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|I decided to give this a try as it was a rainy, dismal day and AZ.com had it on sale for $1.99. I watched it... it was not nearly as funny or interesting as the first two Ice Age flix. A few new characters and a brief appearance by Sid's family was good for a few chuckles but I would not care to see it again. Kids will probably like it... my advice rent it yes, buy it No Thanks..
B0002V7ODI|5.0|it is a bit of a different take on being a hero. But my son loves monkeys so I think to him, this fits the theme.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|A friend recommended this movie and said I would either love it or hate it. As it was on sale for $1.99 I decided what the hey and watched it. It is basicly a rude, crude not politically correct romantic comedy. I enjoyed it, but this is NOT family fare, if you are a prude or easily offended by \\"cuss\\" words this is not your movie. If you want a good laugh and are prepared to suspend your sensitivity for a few hours you may well enjoy it.
B003V2HWP0|5.0|I got it to see the clothing, I am interested in historicle fashion, but found a beautiful story about love in a difficult situation. If you like historical movies this is for you.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|doesn't have same feel as pc version or my android version.  Hope it gets upgrade soon.  okay but that is about it.
B0000524E5|5.0|my husband loves this movie, so I bought it for him as a christmas present to add to his dvd collection
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My only complaint is that it is so addictive I play it way too much.  it is great on the kindle fire - I just need to read more books and play less angry birds. :)
B000ECXWVI|5.0|My son loves this movie so I bought it for him. a bit graphic, but he is 14. If you are a world war two buff or a nicolas cage fan, I can recommend this movie to you.
1400067820|1.0|It's not so much that the emperor is naked as that he's mincing down the promenade in a glittery g-string with somebody else's socks stuck down the front. Yes, this is an ad hominem attack - but, given the number and spleen of Taleb's own attacks, he more than deserves it.<br /><br />Taleb argues that nothing was ever invented by academics except maybe nuclear fission. Is there an award for the howler of the twenty-first century? If so, this one certainly deserves nomination. Given that there are 88 years left to run in the century and an awful lot of silly people in the world it will probably be beaten, but it still deserves the nomination.<br /><br />I shall, of course, be happy to publish an apology on the day that the Levantine traders of Beirut bricolage a Large Hadron Collider or a Square Kilometre Array.<br /><br />I also look forward to seeing how ancient heuristics will solve all our current problems. Will that be the heuristic about dunking witches or the one about big cannon balls falling faster than little ones? And of course I have no doubt that Taleb's granny has a handy heuristic in her apron pocket for dealing with climate change.<br /><br />It's just possible that there was some value once in the fooled by randomness/black swan idea but this book is an insult to the reader - utter self-indulgence and paranoid irrationality. The literary precedents are Aleister Crowley and G. I. Gurdjieff (though this book is even more turgid and irritating) and the end result is much the same: a great deal of time wasted and a bad taste left in the mouth.
B001HQZJPM|5.0|I love the first two movies and had not seen the third, so the three pack was a great investment
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|Nothing happens after I draw a stickman. App force closes whenever I try to play. Can't use it at all, but I really would like to try the game.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|this is one of those movies that just catches your attention. My 5 year old watches it over and over beginning to end and loves it everytime. a story about a young boy who lost him mom is estranged from his dad, but find a friend in a robot that no one believes in, and ends up a hero. If you liked Iron Giant, you love this
0307352145|5.0|This book has changed my thinking about myself. All our lives we, who were born in this industrial age, are taught about \\"communication\\" and \\"negotiation\\" skills; everywhere, in schools, at home and at work. \\"A team player\\" has been the biggest cliche on resumes. The author very convincingly makes the argument that these industrial/sales era skills will become obsolete in forthcoming knowledge/innovation driven era. This book should be read by at least 50% of the population.
B00005RHGK|5.0|My husband and I saw this together in our dating years, we are scary movie buffs and this is one of the good ones.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am 41 and I could make it thru level 1. It is both cardio and strength training. The moves are not hard to do.
B008476HBM|5.0|Great read, and the plot is just so easy to follow, the romance and wit is what sealed the deal for me.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Great movie!  Not appropriate for children.  Mostly it is a light story about love and all the problems love causes.  Highly recommended.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|broke within 3 days.  Of course I bought it for christmas, and now I've had it too long to return
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Best game I ever for the family my kids are a handful trying to get them off  my phone. So I think your family should get this app
B000N3T0DW|5.0|a story of the secret and lies that many families can relate to. almodovar does it again with this tale of family life in spain! Enjoy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved the books and so glad I read them before I saw the movies.  As with any movie, you loose so much of the book.  The book goes so much deeper into the relationships and decisions she has to make and how she deals with them.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I wanted to love this movie.  Unfortunately all of the parts that I loved, I had already seen in the trailer. Still cute, but I was a little disappointed.
6305428042|4.0|My wife and son love this movie and it has continued to grow on me as well. It is an entertaining holiday movie following the story of a kid who moves to a new town and accidentally brings back 3 witches.  The witches will stop at nothing to get the essence of a child prior to sunrise or they will turn to stone forever.  Funny scene is seeing the mom dressed up as old school Madonna.
B009329Y30|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it. If you liked the trailer, you will like the movie.  Better than i expected.
0061438294|5.0|I LOVE this book.  You can breeze through the photos and captions and get a ton of information.  I found a photo of a stance a fellow keeps taking with me in office meetings.  It made a huge difference in my ability to evaluate the motives of others in their body language.  When I went through the airport security, the fellow shared they used the book for training their reps.  I have recommended it to several an shared what I learned.  Not a huge reader so this is a big deal to me.  It explained the stance my ex husband was doing and will help me stay well away from that type of person in the future.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|I laughed out loud during moments of this movie. Unfortunately, those moments were few and far between.  I wanted to love this movie!  It had too much seriousness thrown into what I thought was going to be a laugh out loud, vulgar movie.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Jillian is the toughest trainer.  I have to do other tapes and get really fit before using this one.  I am in my fourties and do the January diet exercize thing.  It takes a couple of months with biggest loser tapes to work up to jillian's tapes.  I have jillian in the second level of the biggest loser tapes.  She is just tough.  However, If I work out for the first few months of the year, I get it all off so bottom line, it's worth it.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|To hear your kids belly-laugh is one of the best things in the world, but it's a bonus if a kid's movie makes you laugh too.  This was a fun movie.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This was the free app of the day, and I would have gladly paid for it sooner had I known how awesome it is! Highly recommend!
B009VB97EY|3.0|I expected a fun movie full of hot guys, but i was a little disappointed in the serious nature of the movie.  Still enjoyed the hot guys, but was hoping for a little more fun.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Very entertaining!!!! I watched this several times.  The humor was very adult but all in all I thought it was a great movie!
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|Bruno Mars sings so simply and beautifully!  You will love this CD no matter your music interest.  If you have any love for Michael Jackson, Bruno Mars will sing to you!
B00005OM4K|5.0|This is very very good music that I love to listen to when ever I get a chance. It's just good old rock and roll.
B0098WWEH8|1.0|I bought this because they were on Steven Colbert and got the Colbert bump.  There is only 1 good song on this CD.  Buy the single!!
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What can you say about the trilogy of movies Christian bale has acted in, awesome, great the whole family enjoyed them.
0345529057|5.0|Whether or not you've watched any of the HBO episodes based on the books, this is a great read for any ADULT fan of science fiction novels. Excellent characters and story line. Martin's writing style makes it very easy to get sucked into his medieval world.<br /><br />This is coming from a guy who RARELY stays entertained through an entire book, much less a series of books.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|Loved this book, great reading, a must read in every school and every home, higly recommend it for everyone thanks
B001NHNG64|5.0|I recommend this author.  I COULD NOT PLACE THIS ONE DOWN.  I hope the rest of the books are THIS good.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|The whole series of the Bourne movies are well done. We were looking forward to watching this one and it didn't disappoint. Will there be another?
B00371QQ2U|1.0|I originally bought this about a year ago from Best Buy. There were a few critical reviews regarding incredably long load times and problems with playing the disk, but I had a relatively new Panasonic player with the latest Firmware update so I took a chance. That was my first mistake. It sure did take a long time to load, and about midway through the movie I decided to finish it the next day so I hit \\"Stop\\" and figured I would simply go to the main menu the next day, find the \\"Chapters\\" section and simply resume where I had left off since most blu-ray discs don't allow you to automatically pick up at the exact point where you left off when you turn off the machine because of the encoding on the disc. The next day I again waited a very long time for the disc to load, and every time I attempted to go to the \\"Chapters\\" part of the main menu it would go to a blue screen and re-boot the disc. Finally I just let the movie start automatically (This movie does that without first going to the main menu)and figured I would simply hit the chapter advance on my remote until I was back where I left off the night before but no, -now it would allow me to skip maybe one or two chapters before again going to that blue screen where it would once again shut down to take forever to re-boot the disk, and on and on this went. I tried exchanging it twice at Best Buy, and finally just ended up returning it. -Fast forward to this year and all the good deals around Black Friday. I saw Amazon had Apollo 13 for a great price, and I thought that by now Universal Studios surely would have fixed this major problem. This was a very poor assumption, and my second mistake. My player again had the latest Firmware update, but there were the same exact problems as the first time! -After all this needless aggravation I felt like the lowest portion of my alimentary canal needed to be looked at by a specialist due to this interminable pain in my a**!!! Save yourself a LOT of frustration and DON\\"T buy this movie till Universal fixes this!!!!!
B004TI5N38|5.0|I am almost through with this book and have trouble putting it down.  I had just read ' The Forgotten' and was once again reminded what a great writer David Baldacci is!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book was amazing just like the first one. I was skeptical about reading the series but I am so glad I did. I can't wait for the movie!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Good story line. Didn't want to put  it down.  Everyone wants that special connection and the forever love.  Would recommend to others who want the \\"happily ever after\\"
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I have loved this movie for as long as I can remember. My mom & I would watch this EVERY YEAR !! I STILL watch even though my mom has passed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I can't decide if this book was better than The Hunger Games. There were definitely lots more action in the arena than in the first book, but the story in the first book had so much more oomph. Whichever way, I enjoyed this book immensely and I can't wait to get started on Mockingjay.<br /><br />Again I was so impressed with the author's creativity and that she doesn't shy away from the darker elements that are necessary to develop the story and draw the reader deeper into Katniss and Peeta's world. New characters were introduced, some of which I liked as much as familiar characters from the first book. I found this arena far more interesting and dangerous than the one in the first book, as Katniss, Peeta and the others were more in danger of elements in the arena, than against their opponents. A lot more imagination went into the creation of this arena and it upped the suspense a lot. For that alone I give Catching Fire five stars.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of romance, but I do agree that the love-triangle in this series is necessary for plot development. I'm still Team Peeta, but I'm hoping more focus will be  placed on Gale in the third book, so I can get to know him a little more. This was another excellent read that kept me up well into the early hours of the morning. Five stars and two thumbs up!
B003F3PMYI|5.0|Too long, our society has focused on the negative behavior of our culture. It's refreshing to hear someone emphasize the positive and awesome potential we were endowed with at conception, by our Creator.<br />I would recommend this read to all desiring to live out their dreams, based on their purpose, and stemming from a grateful heart
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was a heart pounding movie without a moment to catch your breath.  This on the edge of your seat thriller kept me engaged the whole time.  I recommend this as one of the best Bourne movies yet.
B007THA4FI|5.0|I like the idea of how you can change the format of the font.  It is easy to read on one's eyes/
1609613937|2.0|This starch solution diet has to be categorized as an extreme diet - all vegan with no added oil at all except very limited fat from nuts and seeds. Just like any kind of diet, it will work for some dedicated people, but not all. The author is very opposed to protein diet, but the \\"unhealthy protein diet\\" he referred to included eating nothing but protein and fat - in unlimited quantity too! I guess everybody has figured out how unbalanced that is! The popular low carb diets nowadays emphasize fresh, clean veggies and fruits, on top of reasonable amount of lean protein and good fats, plus small amount of whole grains, root vegetables and other starchy whole foods, low carb diets are very balance diets, only the name should be \\"low starch\\" instead of \\"low carb\\".<br /><br />I appreciate the dedication from the author, but I cannot adopt such extreme diet, not in a long term. Good luck to the people who like it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Just had a time with all the&#34; Buttons&#34;--I realized that allI had to do was to het the web button.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always use Random as it is more challenging.  I've always liked playing Solitaire with cards so this is great.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book touches home with me. I could relate in ways. I could feel what Charlie did with Sam. But most of all. I connected with me.
B00094ASR2|5.0|Great addition to any vinyl collection, although this can be really hard to find. Crisp, clear sound with outstanding dynamic range.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|im actually pretty happy with this game. its very hard to beat, and i would definitely recommend that you read the how to play section first, but once you get the hang of it, its very addicting. one thing though. i believe it would be better if you were able to read about a country before initially infecting it.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This is a fun, and time consuming game. I love it.<br />People stop crying about the diamond's,all most all<br />Games are this way.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie and thought it would take something away from the read but surprisingly it had me gripped from the beginning to the end.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I overall loved this book and I think everyone should read it. I will admit it's more of a story for girls because it has more emotion. Both the book and the moviegoers amazing but I think that if you watch the movie and read the book it will help you to better understand.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I thought this was going to be your typical Vegas wedding story but it is so much more. Exceeded my expectations, I just couldn't put it down.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed playing this game the role play in the storyline is excellent I also like to speed of the game and difficulty of the tasks at hand<br />.this game is definitely 5 stars.  if I could give it more I would .highly recommended great at of the day Amazon
B00881VLCE|5.0|If it was possible to save it be great . But love the different puzzles to choose from . I love how clear the pictures are. Almost if you could up load your own picture an turn it into a puzzle would be great.
B00003CXUM|4.0|My product arrived on time and was in excellent condition. I really apperciate the booklet. It was presented as advertise. This should be require by all sellers to give as much information as possible about their product. This cost me more than I usually spend on dvds but was well worth it.
B000784WMW|5.0|I have seen many movies of Jane Eyre from Orson Wells on, and in my opinion this is the best.  I am so glad that the editors restored the missing hour from the original.  It was not on the VHS version and left a great hole in the story.  I highly recommend this version as a definitive version of the story.
B0007KS7D0|5.0|Though not a \\"true\\" macro lens, this converter lens maximizes macro photos.  I own a Canon Powershot SX40.  I'm so impressed by this lens that I will be buying the DCR-250.<br /><br />The lens works with the telephoto (in this case 35x), with the lens fully extended.  The depth of field is very narrow.  The camera is focused by moving the entire camera back and forward.  I'm ordering a Macro focusing rail to add to my tripod to make this easier, otherwise it can be very difficult to make the micro adjustments needed for truly clear super macro photography.  As a rule, I don't use the digital zoom capability of the camera, since I'm a purist.<br /><br />The photos of the critters I've posted are handheld, but I've bought a heavy duty table top tripod for the other shots.<br /><br />The bottom line:  Check out the photos I've posted.  I DO NOT adjust for color, nor do I ever use a flash.  I prefer natural lighting and allow the camera to catch the colors.  I put my photos into Photoshop Elements 9, crop then adjust the lighting (highlights and shadows) if needed.  Otherwise they are untouched.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this lens!
B003L20IJM|4.0|The only reason that I did not give this 5 stars was that it's a bit lightweight for five.  Emma Thompson has done it again.  She has taken Nanny McPhee to wonderful new adventures and again transformed a family of little stinkers into well-mannered children, just in time for their father to come home.  I can always count on Ms. Thompson to give a sterling performance whether it be Shakespeare or Nanny McPhee.  She is a nine day's wonder.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This is a remarkable series. And now I can watch it on my time and not have to wait till January or the next week. Fellows did a spectacular job in writing such an intricate, yet full, set of characters. And Maggie Smith would be worth the watch all by herself.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Very good movie.  I'm always amazed at how well Eastwood acts.  Watched this one with my family and we all enjoyed the movie.  It was very predictable but a good family film (not suitable in my opinion due to language for younger children).
B005RYF5JA|5.0|What a great production. I have all of Celtic Woman DVD's and this is a great addition. They never present the same approach that worked the last time but always strike out into new, uncharted areas.
0446580848|2.0|Just finished today - way too long for the story with extraneous complete pages that could have been skipped.  And as stated the last 2 chapters were a complete \\"poof the bad guy is dead\\" and no worrying about loose ends that existed.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I like the book it is interesting and it has a lot of excitement. I  like the setting and other things
B004LWZW6U|3.0|The prehistoric flesh-eating fish are poised to attack swimmers again in a waterpark named \\"Big Wet\\" (with an \\"adult-themed\\" swimming pool). Believing the danger is imminent, our heroine Maddy (Danielle Panabaker), co-owner of \\"Big Wet,\\" tries to stop the other co-owner (and her step-father) Chet (David Koechner) from opening the waterpark, but greedy Chet would not listen. This is a time tested formula for making horror movies, but somehow director John Gulager (\\"Feast\\" and two sequels) fails to make full use of it. In short, everything in \\"Piranha 3DD\\" is weak.<br /><br />\\"3DD\\" takes too much time explaining what is obvious to most viewers and repeating what the predecessor did, but in less effective way. The sequel, though it has enough gores and some good ideas, looks tamer nonetheless. In the second half the film gets better with bloody mayhem that finally happens, but we still feel we are being short-changed, as the film is neither gory nor funny enough.<br /><br />Three players from the original, Christopher Lloyd, Paul Scheer and Ving Rhames, come back, but their roles are small and forgettable ones (though I like the final line of Christopher Lloyd's character). David Hasselhoff appears as himself, parodying his own image more than once. It is funny, but the joke just overstays its welcome.<br /><br />By definition a sequel is destined to be tied to the original, and thus comparison is inevitable. Maybe \\"Piranha 3DD\\" would have been received more positively had it been released before Alexandre Aja's campy and ultra-gory \\"Piranha 3D.\\" \\"Piranha 3DD\\" is a mildly amusing horror comedy. The problem is, not many viewers want a mildly amusing horror comedy when it is a sequel to \\"Piranha 3D.\\"
B009Z8HPYM|4.0|It is nice to have old timers, like Neil and company, be able to recycle themselves, but still sound fresh again. Really like the sound, especially the 3 long jam tracks, but the other tracks fit into the album as well.  I also liked the Chrome Dreams II album.  A couple of those tracks also reminded me of Ragged Glory, as does this album.  Neil, ya done good, keep on rockin' in the free world!
B008LSVLVA|5.0|(Note: this applies to the Blu-Ray version.)<br /><br />When one approaches a concert video there are two things to consider - the actual musical performance, and the way the video presents that performance.<br /><br />First the performance itself. For those who have seen the tour live or have heard either the previous live release \\"Catalogue, Preserve, Amass\\"; or any of the (ahem) \\"unofficial\\" recordings that are floating around, I can assure you that you will not be disappointed. SW stated frequently as the tour legs progressed that the band had, in fact, come together as a true band, not just a group of hired hands following a score. Yes, the nature of the music is such that many portions of the performance are the same each night; but to hold this as a negative is as meaningless as saying that an orchestra performing a classical piece plays the same notes every night - that's how it is written! So one has to look at the nuances - how the band performs in those areas where there are opportunities for personalization. And I use the term personalization rather than improvisation because improvisation implies stepping outside of the main structure is such a way as to create almost a new piece. That is not the nature of the music in this case; and so while the music is certainly not what would be considered \\"classical\\" music, it is more true to that approach than to a jazz band that would take a basic structure and go off (for better or worse) in entirely new directions (note: that does NOT mean this is classical music - it is rock, leaning toward rock-jazz fusion). So some songs (for example \\"Index\\" and \\"Postcard\\") do sound essentially exactly the same every night, while songs such as \\"No Twilight Within The Courts Of The Sun\\" allow a greater variation in total approach, and songs like \\"Deform To Form A Star\\", \\"Remainder The Black Dog\\", and \\"Raider II\\" have sections where personalization can and does occur. But sticking to the official releases, one need only to listen to the \\"Catalogue Preserve Amass\\" CD that was recorded at the end of the first leg of the touring cycle (October 2011) to see how the band progressed from then to this concert (April 2012). The interplay between the musicians confirms SW's opinion of the band's growth. The one member of the band who seems to be a bit behind in that regard is guitarist Niko Tsonev; but he plays his parts flawlessly, and it can be legimately argued that SW was trying to create a sound where, unlike traditional rock, the guitar plays more of a supporting role than an up-front role. And even in his case there are are subtleties in his performance that are perhaps not truly appreciated without seeing the film. The \\"star\\" of the show in that regard is, IMHO, keyboardist Adam Holzman. SW himself is only a relatively small portion of the sound, concentrating for much of the show on his vocals and filling in background parts (and conducting). So perhaps in that way we can draw a jazz analogy - in jazz bands that are not led by the guitarist, the guitar tends to be a supporting instrument, with the other instruments stepping out front more often. How long SW wanted to pursue this type of direction I, of course, cannot say; but as much as I am a fan of Porcupine Tree, much of this music could not have been performed, at least to this level, by PT. But I disagree with those who would say that this is a complete break from SW's past; in the live setting one hears more continuity with PT than might be apparent from listening solely to the studio albums (\\"Insurgentes\\" and \\"Grace For Drowning\\") that the material is drawn from. To me it is an evolution, not a revolution - and that is very satisfying. One other thing I will add - from the first time I heard recordings from these tours, I almost never listen to the studio \\"Grace For Drowning\\", as the live performances have so much more life - again, undoubtedly due to the evolution of the touring band. Overall a solid \\"A\\" performance in all respects.<br /><br />As far as the video, the sound is amazing; the surround is tastefully done, adding depth without gimmicks. It's not just an \\"A\\" - it's an \\"A+\\". Now I will say that the filming style may not be for everyone; if all you want to see is SW, then you might be disappointed. For myself the fact that he is largely approached as just another band member is a definite plus; when he is not the natural focus (i.e. largely when he is not singing or playing the relatively few leads he takes for himself) the camera does not linger on him. All the band members are featured rather equally, as, again IMHO, the nature of the music dictates. The only quibble could be that the cuts are frequent and fast; there are times when I would have preferred a bit more lingering on various band members. But the attention paid to the entire band easily makes up for this. The visual quality of the filming is excellent. There is relatively little attention paid to the film backdrops; a little more of that would have been nice. Take all of these together and maybe instead of quite an \\"A\\" I would give the video portion more of an \\"A-\\"; but that could be, as said above, a bit of a quibble, not a real downgrade.<br /><br />So combine all of these observations together and the Blu-Ray rates a solid \\"A\\". If you are expecting only PT, and not interested in SW's growth, then maybe this wouldn't be for you. But if you approve of Wilson's evolution, then there is no reason you shouldn't love this release.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I saw the movie first,  the books Better. I will read the other two then get back to my non fiction.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am hooked on this... love the characters, costumes, scenery and elegance of time period. Looking forward to Season 3!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|I love this book and think it is amazing. It dragged a bit at the end but considering it was free it was a great read.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|Pros: Great how you can create the main character and his friend! Very creative in that aspect.<br /><br />Cons: I don't like the fact that you have to start from the beginning of the level if you fail. Even if you are right at the end!<br /><br />Overall good game and was even better because I got it free.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed a replacement for my kindle because I lost my previous one. This is a great product and a great buy.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It brought me to tears a few times and made me laugh a bunch. Very good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game! I love the challenge of this game. Very highly recommended. A great way to pass the time and use your brain.
0385344333|4.0|4 stars<br />The story is a nice change of pace as this thriller starts as a slow simmer of tension and drama as Reacher hitches a ride with car jackers, but not all is as it appears. FBI, CIA, State Department, and home grown terrorist (+one surprise group) makes for a story with many layers to unfold to find the truth. Jack Reacher is at his best, and the novel is quite satisfying. Key characters are well developed and the plot is cohesive with many twists and turns, although some plot parts are predictable. Some readers may find the final battle a tad over dramatic. Still, Wanted is a worthy edition to the series. Well worth reading.
1439152802|5.0|I have several Kate Morton books on my shelf and I have yet to read them. I am fascinated by the covers. They look so delicious and promise entry into another world--one that is historical and lush--I couldn't resist buying them. I had the opportunity to receive an e-galley of The Secret Keepers, so that became my first Kate Morton novel to be read.<br /><br />Now, I'm a big fan of description--especially of lush surroundings. Let me tell you, Kate Morton is an avid describer to say the least. In the beginning of the book, I felt a bit overwhelmed with the detail--and that's saying a lot for me. I was becoming a bit worried that maybe her storytelling was not for me (what was to become of those three other books of hers on my shelf?!?). Not to worry! The story starts slowly, but I beg you to hang in there. You won't be disappointed. This story has so many marvelous twists and turns. I thought I knew where the tale was headed, but Morton totally pulled the rug out from under me! As the story progressed, I was flying through the pages trying to figure out what was going on and if I was right. This woman is a master storyteller. I was really amazed at her plotting and the intricacy of the story. Kate Morton is a real literary talent.<br /><br />I wish I could tell you more, but the beauty of the story is in the discovery, in it's unfolding. I fairly yelped near the end when a major secret was unleashed. I had to read a section a couple of times to make sure I understood it correctly because I couldn't believe what I was reading. The author totally turned the story on it's head--awesome!<br /><br />I can't wait to get to her other stories on my shelf!
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I have always loved the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and own the entire collection in hardcover.  Having it on a reader puts any story a swipe away.  I also love the original (I think) illustrations.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|To to to to to to to to to to  reply to this entry through a lot more to Terre the first place for real reason why I think that this is the best of luck with your friends to this is a great way
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone see with the doubt of what exists beyond this world. Reading a scientific explanation of what Dr. Alexander experienced is a refreshing take on the subject of the God's existence.
B00486070K|4.0|I think I will enjoy this product as my mother doesn't have wireless at her house and I will need this to connect.
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|A must for a RATM fan! Everything I hoped for and more, full of stuff I never knew. Come with it now!!!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I do so love dragons and the critters in this game are so freaking adorable! it is very reminiscent of pokemon in that you can collect, breed and level dragons of various types. and of course the urge to collect them all is encouraged. each type of dragon has its own habitat and you can grow different kinds of dragon treats to feed them. this is a very entertaining game indeed
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|If you like lots of suspense and action, this movie is it. You will be stuck to your seat from beginning to end. Enjoy! not for the squemish or children.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This movie flat-out rocks. I haven't read the books, so I had no preconceived notions about the story at all. I love detective thrillers such as Silence of the Lambs, Seven, and Copycat, as well as TV shows like Law and Order SVU, the Killing, and Twin Peaks. If you like those, you will like The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo as well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It 's scary,  fun,  mystery, entertaining, just all around great game.  Highly recommend,  i got this game for my 9 yr old daughter  Lacey,  lol,  kept her quit and out of my way for a few hours. Im stsrting to play and yes,  i agree with my daughters comments above. Excellent.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I saw this movie on a plane for free, and I still paid too much. Save yourself the $5 and more importantly save your time. The other Bourne movies are significantly better than this one in plot, acting, and high-flying spy thriller action.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Typically Lee Child, full of escapes and drama. Perhaps getting a little more unbelievable these days. But overall I enjoyed it!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Saw this movie on a Singapore Airlines flight from Frankfurt to NYC. It was free on the plane, so it was totally worth it. Not sure it's worth $15 to see it streaming on VOD. Definitely not as good as the Dark Knight with Ledger as the Joker.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A thriller till the end. I could hardly put the book down! I think it's one of the best books of the year!
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This is a revised and updated version of the classic Playstation 2 game. Of course it shows some age since that era, particularly in terms of graphical quality but the story and addictive gameplay are what make this game great. This game has an uncanny ability to evoke a spectrum of emotions like few games this era are able to do: humor, sadness, triumph...its all in here. If you enjoy games with intriguing storylines and vibrant characters, this is a game for you.<br /><br />This game almost plays like two games. On one hand you have a sort of \\"social sim\\" where you befriend various characters throughout the game to make more powerful personas. This may sound a bit dull, but its actually very fun getting to know the various characters and personalities and feeling as though you genuinely connect to their stories. The characters are multi-dimensional and really come alive. Many deep issues are covered in this game: friendship, lonliness, death, sexuality, loss. It is done with amazing nuance and style.<br /><br />On the flip side you have more of an old school rpg turn based fighting style which occurs in the \\"TV World\\" during maze-like dungeons. Admittedly some of these battles can get repetative, but leveling up, item gaining and side quests make it much more enjoyable and it is VERY addictive.<br /><br />The Vita version updates locations, characters, events, voice acting, items and how persona cards are gathered in addition to many others. It is the definitive version of a really great game and at this juncture in time is a GREAT reason to purchase a Vita.<br /><br />Peace and Happy Gaming!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great for organization. keeps everything in one place keeps your thoughts together in one place, it is absolutely great, easy to use
B003MC5N28|4.0|This book really makes you think and I really enjoyed it<br />Joan (the maim character) has to start thinking for himself and is a good story of a child becoming a man/boy<br />The only reason why I didn't put 5 stars is because I already read the book once before, so it was a little boring because I already knew what was going to happen. But otherwise it would've been an obvious 5 stars
B008458O3S|5.0|This has been one of the most fun puzzle games I have played on Android to date. Not having to make micropayments to get to a level or any imbedded garbage to force Facebook or Twitter posts. Well worth the price.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I loved this book it is one of the best books that I have ever read. I loved the way that the author ended the book. I enjoyed the flashbacks and for once in a book the actually made some sense. I can't wait to read more by this author. This is probably the best book that I have read in a long time. I encourage everyone to read this book and now I can't wait to see the movie.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I am just getting started with this game and find it addicting!  It's a challenge, great graphics.  Good for all ages, my grand daughter (11 years old) loves it too.
B00000IUT7|5.0|My great-grandson loved this engine. He has a brio train set at home and Christmas morning was made more wonderful by this engine.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|This should entertain science fiction fans, especially people who enjoy Philip K. Dick. The plot pacing was good, nothing seemed to drag. The concept of the movie was interesting and creative. The way Joseph Gordon-Levitt looked and acted like Bruce Willis was surprisingly convincing.<br /><br />If you only feel like seeing an action movie, this probably won't satisfy you. If you are in the mood to see a creative science fiction movie, you should give this a try.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Cute funny funy funny.what can or should one say clever and even poignant fantasy that is very funny throughout the film
B00008BXJJ|5.0|As a long time AC/DC fan, I was glad to get this two disc set.  Also good sound quality to set.  Lots of fun and memories to listen to.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|This was a good follow-on to the Bourne Trilogy, adding new elements to the &#34;basic&#34; Bourne story line.  Look forward to the next installment.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|What can you say, if you like the Rolling Stones this is a must have for your collection.  Good sound quality on the re-master.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book was equally good, if not better than the first one!! The author has an amazing creative mind...
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I really like this cover, I like the fact that you just click the Kindle in place. It also starts and shuts off when you open the cover, that is really awesome. I love my Kindle but the shut off button is so tiny, it makes it hard to  be shutting or turning on all the time. With this cover it's a breeze. I'm very  satisfied with this purchase and it came pretty quick.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I've seen this film three times in the movies and once on blu-ray and cannot understand the lukewarm reviews I have been reading.  From the moment I saw it, it became my favorite comic book movie of all time.  The cast is great and the action never lets up.  The final hour is almost non-stop suspense and action with that great music continuously driving it along.  Bale, Caine and Oldman are predictably great and Anne Hathaway looks fantastic and steals every scene as the best Catwoman ever.<br />I have to laugh whenever I read that this film is a great letdown after The Dark Knight.  I hate to say anything in bad taste but I believe that The Dark Knight only became a classic only as a result of Heath Ledger's OD.  There was so much about that film that I did not buy.  The bit with the two ferries was the worst.  Does anyone really believe that a ferry of criminals, enemies of society, would not have blown up the ferry of Gotham's working stiffs, given the chance, to save themselves?  Yet no one finds this implausible?  The action scene with Batman fighting the SWAT cops to prevent them from killing the doctors tied up with Joker masks was totally convoluted.  Did anyone find the conclusion with Batman on the run from the death of Harvey Dent satisfying?  (Yes, I know that that ending leads into the plot of the new film, but did you really find that ending satisfying when you first saw it?)  The Dark Knight Rises does leave one with a satisfying feeling upon leaving the theater.  As stated, it is my favorite of the Dark Knight Trilogy. (I prefer Batman Begins to the Dark Knight as well.)<br />There are so many other great things about this film.  The high shot of the hundreds of Gotham City cops running down Wall Street to confront Bane's thugs never fails to be breathtaking.  I love the fact that so little CGI was used in this scene: just hundreds of extras and stuntmen.I also love the scene of that little boy singing The Star Spangled Banner as Bane and his thugs infiltrate the football stadium to begin their destruction.  Simply brilliant. The Dark Knight Rises is a film with great thought behind it, a great action film and a great comic book film, a true masterpiece.  I've really grown to respect Producer/Director Christopher Nolan as a result of this film.<br />The extra features on the blu-ray are fine.  Theres also a documentary on the various Batmobiles that runs about an hour.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I dont know if its my kindle or this app but its not DOWNLOADING! every other app is downloading just fine but this one wont download!!!! plz fix if its the app!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I loved it it had great descriptions and word choice<br />Over all I would rate this a 100% and I would recommend it to all
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|this game is so cool,  but I cant get past level four. but its still awesome. - growl - level four doesn't make sense to me.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|First I want to say how much it saddens me to see people give a 1 star rating for a good app based only on one malfunctioning feature. a feature that doesn't affect the app as a whole.<br /><br />Anywho. the newsfeed/timeline issue has been fixed. the app works just fine. The only problem so far is when writing a status. It starts to tag pages if you don't click ok the page it wants to tag it will delete the entire word.It took me 10 minutes to write 2 sentences.Other than that, it is a smooth running app. The layout isn't like apps for apple its probably better because with apples facebook app you cant access pages you run. Here you can.<br /><br />Note I'm using Kindle Fire not am andriod phone.
B006NFKUF6|5.0|It was a great game to me. This free app was fun for what it has, you have robot to fight and the king of the robot and bomb robots to entertain you.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|When you first read this book you think it's going to be an epic story for ages. It's not. This is a book that is practical. Not solid but not a bad book. Actually it's the best book I have ever read. It gets you to not understand your problems no matter how bad you got it but accept them.it moves you. It tells you that yeah some people have it worse than you but it doesn't make you feel any better. Recommend it from ages 13-40
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is the only book I have ever read twice other than the Bible, and I read voraciously.  I googled his CD of choice to enhance deep meditation and prayer.  It is very simply written, absolutely anyone can read and understand it.  His visions are clear and awe-inspiring.  Taken from a neurosurgeon's viewpoint who was steeped in science rather than the spiritual, I found this to be a tremendously credible book.  I loved it.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This game keeps making my keyboard show up and it is not working but it works your mind very hard
B007UXT6T6|4.0|The special effects were pretty good over all but the plot was definitely quite cheesy at times. I had hoped it would be better.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Fast delivery and awesome quality. I love this franchise and can watch it over and over again.<br />I hope they continue with the franchise!
1933492279|2.0|The cover of the book came off within minutes due to bad workmanship. The glue did not attach properly to the book cover.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|This movie is amazing. A kind of movie you can not just watch once. It is a kids movie but with a lot of adult jokes thrown in. I personally recommend that everyone sees this!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|High points:<br />1.  King George VI handling adversity by exploring the full range of emotions as it contrasted to his duty.<br />2.  Supporting role of his wife dealing with a family of means.<br /><br />Personal low point:<br />I had no reference for this British monarch prior to the film.  Regardless of the film, I thought I knew more than Winston Churchill during this period of world history.  Perhaps not.
0425263916|5.0|When I read &#34;Bared by You&#34; I was just totally in awe with the story line.  Then when I read this one, it just took it to a whole level! Sylvia Day is an awesome author and both of the Crossfire series books were well written.  I am so excited to read the third installment!  I love &#34;Gideon and Eva&#34;!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible helps me keep up with my bible study. I love how it is free 2. I think that I'm in better knowledge with my religion.

B0086700CM|1.0|I loved it up until the level that you had to tilt the kindle fire. I tilted it but the app didn't register so I died. The other apps let me tilt, but not this one.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Outstanding read.  Finished it in one weekend.  One of the best Jack Reacher novels.  And I have read them all.  Can't wait for the next one.  Go for it Lee!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I suck at chess. I know I do. But with this app, I get better and better, so now I can beat the life-like pc.
B007MB5OCE|3.0|It's just not my kind of book.  Just a little too goofy.  I never got very interested in the characters.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I don't normally play games. I played  flow free and now this easy, cute, and addicting. My kids will sit and gather coins for me while I cook...funny. With time you can get what need without spending real money. Property gets to coin pricey as you go but whatever.
034580404X|4.0|Had to order because of all the rave. Enjoyed each book with new angles from each book. Price was great and shipped quick.
B00902MCVY|1.0|This is an absolute disappointment... While their debut had great musicianship, great songwriting, amazing guitar work and amazing drumming, this over-hyped follow-up falls short on all levels. Not only that, but it sounds FAKE! It does not sound like a real band. It sounds like a computer wrote the songs, not Jari. I feel his pain, dealing with all the problems and what not, but come on!! A 4 minute intro?! It sounds like a bad \\"Shogun\\" Then the second track starts and there's ANOTHER intro! Ridiculous. The whole thing sounds rushed, plastic, and painfully obvious that they're trying TOO hard to be \\"over the top\\" whereas bands like Dimmu Borgir and Cradle of Filth can pull off \\"over the top\\" without sounding like they were trying so hard to do so... Wintersun has become a melodic, non-\\"evil\\" sounding Tartaros. EPIC FAIL
B004NS710C|5.0|A thrilling display of danger, bravery and sacrifice based on a true story. I was on the edge of my seat the entire film!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. The survival drama in The Hunger Games was epic and I couldn't stop turning the pages.I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves stories which always leave you interested and with a craving for adventure.
0756666937|5.0|My nine and seven year old grandsons loved this book. It is beautifully, laid out, easy to follow. They are enjoying it. A great gift.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is a great series from HBO films. If you enjoyed Band of Brothers, you will definately love the Pacfic.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|The music was good, the drama was light, and the outcome was no surprise but the sum of the parts is less than the total experience.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Needless to say I have finished the first four books in record time.  George R. R. Martin is a great author.  Very entertaining.
B0053O89YM|4.0|Not thrilled I had to buy the whole season because my TiVo doesn't always record this show because some days it starts late but it's a great show.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I love Meryl Streep so I will enjoy ANYTHING she is in, and this was no exception.  She plays her part (s) so well.<br />This wasn't filled with lots of action that kept you on the edge of you seat, but it was a nice story about a longtime marriage that had gone a little stale, and her determination to change that!  I will watch it again some time.  Both leads did a good job.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am so grateful for this book; it's an affirmation of heaven on earth.  I hope it gets translated into other languages.
B0096BIENY|5.0|Bought for my husband and he loves it! HE HAS PLAYED IT MANY TIMES ALREADY.  ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION.<br />tHANKS
0525953728|5.0|I thought that &#34;No Easy Day&#34; was a particularly interesting glimpse into the secret nature of DEVGRU (Seal Team Six) and the final operation &#34;Neptune Spear&#34; which took out UBL. The book was well written, and it was never boring, filled with action packed war stories from start to finish. It was also a fairly quick read as I was able to finish it in just a few days during my morning and evening commutes into the city. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I encourage anybody who is interested in either the UBL Raid or the U.S. Navy Seals to give it a shot. I do not think you will be disappointed.

B00005U11Z|5.0|So, I'm a bit biased, having been present at this gig.  This was a fantastic concert.  Great playing, sound and set list.  Augeri does just fine.  Even on the way to Mandalay Bay, we were on the skeptical side, regarding him.  Glad I went and glad they were filming.  Very good dvd.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|Dark story, lots Blood and gore.  Best documentry of the year. . . . . . . . . .
B00AL1ONN8|3.0|The lp is a little different than I expected but still classic T.I. I still would refer it to others.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|When will the sequal be out? Very funny if you have warped humor. . . . . . . .
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Great movie, loved all the different singing arrangements.  Definately a great comedy movie with a happy ending.  All things that I love in a movie!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was pretty attention grabbing from the get go. I was iffy on reading it because of all the hype about it, I was afraid I would lose interest but once I started I couldn't stop. It's not a typical love story and I love how Katniss is so smart. I'm definitely finishing the series now that I've started.
1451608659|5.0|This book is an excellent read for any gymnastics fan! A very open and often hidden truth about the behind the scenes life of an Olympian.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I REALLY ENJOY THIS GAME,BUT THE STORY LINE IS JUST STUPID! THE REALLY  BAD part is it gets worse as you go<br />But I love the rest of the game.<br />The puzzles are<br />Great.
1419705849|5.0|this is another book in my sons collection he very much enjoyed reading these books and looking forward to the next 1
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't care what Colleen Hoover writes, I'm a huge fan. i saw Hopeless listed and could not purchase this book fast enough. i will anxiously await her next book.
B005B0QYMM|3.0|If you've watched even a few episodes of those paranormal phenomenon shows hosted by a moody, hardkor, spikey-haired white guy, and if you know how ridiculous they are, then you'll get a kick out of this parody film.  I was a little skeptical going in, after seeing the gratuitous use of the \\"demon face morphing\\" software in the trailer.  It's purposefully cheesy in parts, notably when the main character slaps on his \\"cool mysterious ghost hunter\\" facade.  And he's absolutely dead on.  Paranormal shows ARE this cheesy.  It's when the scares get real that the cheesy farce falls apart and things get interesting.<br /><br />There's scarcely a plot for the movie to cling to, causing it to lapse in places and feel longer than it actually is, but the gradual build up of scares is worth the slow moments.  The characters, though unremarkable, are fairly likable and some even relatable (i.e. T.C. whose family background is briefly mentioned).<br /><br />This review makes it seem like I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel (with found footage films, you kind of are...), BUT I did enjoy it.  Some of the creeps and scares were unexpected and the ending was a nice touch.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I thought it would be funnier. Seemed a little too dramatic for a comedy. I still love Marky Mark though!
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore has a way of writing the truth very simply and easy to understand. It is a great story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This review is actually asking for a review of season 3, which I have not seen yet. However seasons one & two.  Well done!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have been using  Avast for years on my personal computers with O problems. so when I get my new Kindle Fire HE who do you suppose that I want to protect my tablet? Avast is the pest. You never NO it is running Avast just runs quietly in the background and does it`s job and protects your equipment. I love this program and would suggest it for all your computing needs.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|The story, for one my age, is poignant, funny, thoughtful and Very well acted. Stellar cast and good writing never hurts. A gem!
B004529NKC|5.0|Love all the step up movies. Hope they make plenty more movies. They keep getting better and better so keep up the good work.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time.  I love the fact that the character in the book just made a decision, really believed in it, completed it and I enjoyed reading about the people he met on his way.  A nice, uplifting story.  I didn't care much for his wife though.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Superbly written with intense emotion! I couldn't put it down, so exciting and compelling. That's characters are unique, complex yet endearing. A must read!!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|We liked it a lot! We watched it three times. In 1080 HD it was awesome  It was well worth the extra dollar for HD.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really fun find it game. Challenging enough without being too frustrating. The guide is a lifesaver if you really get stuck, but I haven't needed to rely on it to play. Quite worth the upgrade fee.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|My Granddaughter loved this CD & I would recommend it. The product came in quick & was what I expected.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I LOVE IT ITS SO AMAZING CAUSE IT HELPS ME UNDERSTAND WORDS I never knew before. AND I can use those words in my vocabulary
1419707663|5.0|grandson loved the gift. He asked for these & I would recommend it to friends & family. The product came in quick & was what I expected.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is great it is so creative and extremely fun! I stayed up all night playing it I suggest it 100%
1932907009|5.0|I LOVE this book. The writing style is easy to read and not preachy.  It's like sitting down and talking with a friend over a nice beer. The tips and analysis is so very helpful. It gives me a brand new understanding towards movies and shows. I will never look at a movie the same way again.<br /><br />What a valuable Gem. I highly recommend this book
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is an amazing, empowering Mother-Daughter film that uses the historical tapestry to not only weave the lessons of the past with the present, the importance of family and community, but it also pays homage to the traditionally \\"woman\\" art of tapestry and the bonds that women formed making them.  Like other comments, I highly recommend this film as a great family bonding experience, especially with the little ladies of your home - though the boys will really like it too:)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched this to round out my Downton Abbey experience.  It was as interesting as the rest of the series
B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I chose this rating because the way the movie was transfered made it very small on my tv. It is new for them to come over that way. Makes it hard to watch and is distracting to have so much screen black. It was not allowed to change the tv setting. As I said we have rented movies for years on line and it is only recently we noted the change.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|No problems installing or using, highly recommended. Say goodby to the USB cable.<br />User guides could be a bit more accessible, but its mostly self-explanatory.
B0067R0APK|2.0|This product really doesn't do any more than the original free version.  So far a waste of money.  The free version is fine.
B009HV2JT8|3.0|While it won't win any rewards, this movie is a great popcorn movie.  The visuals are amazing and the action is fun.
0547581033|5.0|This book has a great rhythm when read aloud.  It is pleasing to both mother and child.  It is the baby gift that I give to all new moms.
1594202842|3.0|Amy Chua's book \\"Battle Hymn Of The Tiger Mother\\" has been widely publicized in the press. I sought to read this book to get an idea of what the hype was all about. Chua, a Law Professor at Yale University School of Law, believes that the way that Europeans parents (read Westerners including the U.S.A. and Canada) bring up children is inferior to the way that the Chinese bring up their children. She believes that the Chinese way of bringing up children is fart superior. She talks about how she brought up both of her daughters in an extremely strict way. Her daughters were not allowed to have video games, sleep overs, or play sports. Their lives were lives of study, music lessons on either the violin or piano, and any grades less than an A, even a B were not tolerated. There was even a time when she viciously criticized a birthday card that her daughter gave her. She discusses the regimented life that she gave both of her daughters. In the end her eldest daughter complies with all of these conditions, but the younger one becomes more rebellious with age. The culmination is a blowup by the daughter against her mother in a restaurant in Moscow's Red Square when her mother wants her to try some caviar, and the daughter finally blow up thinking that the caviar is disgusting looking. I find that her assumptions are blatantly ethnocentric and stereotypic. I do not think that any culture, Chinese or Western, has all of the answers on what is the proper way to bring up children. Not all children are either gifted students or musicians like her daughters. Her husband is also a Law Professor at Yale Law School. In fact, her husband at one point thinks she being too stereotypic about being a \\"Chinese parent\\". All children are different. If Lou and Marge Sutter of Viking, Alberta had followed that idea none of their six sons would not have made the National Hockey League, nor been on a Stanley Cup winning team as Duane and Brent were. Chua herself comes from a mixed background.Although she was the daughter of Chinese parents, she was born in the Philippines and was raised as a Roman Catholic. Her husband is Jewish and she raised her daughters in the Jewish tradition. In the end Chua has to accommodate both cultures. I find that her book is good reading as to how not to raise children.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Angela Lansbury hosts this preview of Season 3. We get some clues, but nothing is given away. She tells about the main characters as a review.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book exceeded my expectations and I cannot wait to start reading the third and final book in the trilogy, Mockingjay!
B004DSX5B6|4.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it.  The only downfall is that it states it comes in different colors but doesn't allow you to choose those colors.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. I never would have tried it had it not been free, but, so glad I did!
0802473156|5.0|this is a great book.  came quickly.  great price.  good easy reading for anyone.  alot cheaper than go to book store
B004QDCZ3M|5.0|We have really two choices here where I live,the local Walmart or FYE in our mall.To get the deluxe edition of this was never going to happen at Walmart and FYE could get it, but for roughly $30.Amazon had it for $10 less and my daughter loves it and the fact it has so much extra material.I don't know much about the group so I can't review the material but I do know my daughter says it's fantastic! I did see Florence sing with the Rolling Stones on their 50th anniversary show on youtube and if that was any indication of how good this album might be then I say buy it!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|As always, Stephen King not only gives us suspense, but food for thought as well. Thanks fora great treatment of one of America's what if  questions.
B00005LK95|5.0|Great family movie. Get really for laughs. My kids and I watched this years ago and it was fun to watch it again.
B004PGO25O|5.0|Dovetails nicely with his other nonfiction works. Can.t hear his advice too many times. If you want to be taken seriously for your work you need to read Steven pressfield.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Enzo, the dog featured in this story, is absolutely endearing!  Anyone who loves & appreciates pets would really enjoy this book.  Don't miss it!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This novel is very good and a lot of fun. The whole idea of an elderly man running away in his slippers is funny by itself, but the places and times he consistently found himself in were great.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I really was not expecting much when I downloaded this App.  However, I noticed the amazing reviews and I downloaded it.  Oh my word!!  This App is super cool!<br /><br />My 10 year old daughter and I are having a blast with it.  No drawing skill required and simple directions. Your drawing comes alive as it navigates a world of challenges.<br /><br />This App is well worth the price.  Perfect for young and old alike.
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|Great movie to watch if you don't have any kids around the house. Hope they make some sort of sequel.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I purchased these for both of my boys for Christmas and they absolutely LOVE them!!! I also purchased the additional cartridges. My boys were excited about how many nerf bullets these can hold at once. I even took it for a spin and it was a lot of fun!! Well made, not too heavy and easy to use for both a 10 and 7 year old. Highly recommend!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book had me laughing so hard in the beginning and choking back tears by the end.  But my very favorite thing about the book is the main character.  I read a lot of romance type and YA books in the past year but I thought Sky was the most normal and relatable of the characters I've read about.  The attraction between Sky and Holder wasn't corny and I loved their playful banter with eachother.  It was so natural because you wish you could say those things to the person you're attracted to and not have it be weird.  This is a must read but beware it gets pretty deep and emotional.
B008602KQI|5.0|Interesting movie, very action packed, looking forward to the sequel Hunger Games II which was being filmed in November this year
0316228532|5.0|I m reading it just now. It's for adults only, not young people. Shows a deep social interest. it is very Good
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|fun long game sortable just want the free sequel. have to sumbmit a review to get it still fun game though
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book--Christian is amazing!  Easy to read--difficult to put the book down--wanted tofind out more and more about him.
B005JIV0NE|5.0|Great addition to our xbox. We purchased this last year.for Christmad and have had no problems .Nice for all ages.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This will be a great addition to my kindle library and is one of the great classics I've always wanted to read
B005KR6OBM|4.0|A lot of fun to look back at all previous episodes. Makes the new  a lot of fun. (Good Clean fun,) I have a 80 year old mother that LOVES this show! Something she has in common with her grandchildren
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book! The characters were so easy to fall in love with and relate to, even as a 35 yr old (maybe because I teach middle school.) The story is one that many can relate to, either through personal experience or through others as cancer has effected nearly everyone in some way. A must read!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|lots of fun. some tasks are annoying with how long they take bc of needing acorns. also, too easy to accidentally buy land.
B008M721MS|5.0|Standard App with the Kindle. Very useful. Of course it has its limitations with the internet. Very simple and managable.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Amazon was kind enough to send me a replacement of Fright Night as my first DVD was flawed.  It was past the time of exchange but since it was a gift, they replaced it without cost to me.  I picked this movie for my daughter who loved it and when I saw it I understood why.  It is a scary movie but has alot of humor in it which lightens the scary parts.  We all love it and Colin Farrell is amazing in his part.  I would recommend this movie.  It is all well-acted by the people in the movie.  The magician is really outstanding and histerically funny.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|The book drew me in at once I couldn't put it down.  The story was well written and made me feel for both characters.
034580404X|5.0|This trilogy took me down memory road by reuniting me emotionally with feelings for all of the Fifty Shades I had dated.  I cried, laughed and became frustrated all over again.  But most important, I was reminded of the great gift of the blessing of LOVE.
B0063IH60K|5.0|hate the ads love the ap. cant put it down. more fun than with cards. I would recomend it to anyone.
030758836X|5.0|After reading a review in the newspaper, I didn't want to wait for the local library to get a copy, so I bought it on line. I give the book 5 stars, and have since passed it on to 3 other people, and they also rate it highly.<br />I also read one of Gillian Flynn's earlier novels &#34;Sharp Objects&#34;, which I only give 4 stars.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was an amazing read! I'm not much of a reader and I was so interested in it I finished it in half the time it usually takes to read a book.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Great transaction, thank you. I accidentally ordered 2 of these books and returned one. It was a Christmas gift for my niece, hope she likes it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it! It's awesome! It's great for people with quick fingers and people that love myths; mysteries and stuff like that.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story is amazing. I did not know what to expect when I started it but it is a must read. I laughed out loud so many times and was sad so many times. However I do wish I could have gotten the two best friends back at the end of the book.
B009ANP4F4|3.0|i'm tired of the same story line but this time it had the worst acting them all. white hip hop boy meets white lyrical female dancer and fall in  love, get angry & fall out of love, then find out they made a mistake at the end and fall back in love. then comes the grand finally & everybody lives happily ever after. what kills me is it's about hip hop dancing mostly but there's never any blacks or hispanics out front as the stars or at least costars. what's up with that, when hip hop came from the black culture. other than that the dancing in the movie was outstanding especially twitch & that's the only reason why i give it three stars!!!
B009JBZH54|4.0|I love these movies and this package was a great first purchase for my blu ray player..  Only complaint is that I wasted couple hours of my life trying to get the ultraviolet downloads that came with it...  from doing some research it seems that this is a problem in general with the digital downloads..<br />&#34;do you know how I got these scars?&#34;
B00992CF6W|5.0|best game ever!!!!!!! just only wish it had better updates but what can I say mojang does what they do best!  ( I have no clue what that ment)  just get the dang game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it it<br />I love the love story between katniss and peeta.really want a catching fire move bad.can't wait to see more
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I went to see the movie on Christmas Day and could not wait for the soundtrack to arrive! It came even sooner than it was promised! Incredible music!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I had 2 problems but the game was great I started my on survival mode there was spiders zombies skeletons and creepers but she. I played it for awhile a saw less and less monsters in till one day it was night and I event to get materials from monsters but I heard them but didn't see them WERE THEY GO????? _My second problem is it cost so much what the neck it cost so much to buy and it was not worth that much it was a ok game if u like building then it a game for u.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from this book, in the end it was full of healing, lust, and unexpected twists.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I myself enjoy glum books and this book did not fail to please me. I read it in less than a day. It was very nice :)
B008U7ZPHS|3.0|Don't get me wrong, I'm really fond of what I've come to call the Percy Jackson style. The problem is that this new novel follows that style in almost the same way as all its predecessors. The details change, the structure has not (for all that it's a good one) which means this book isn't as exciting as I expected it to be. Still, it is worth reading! A great relaxation novel!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Wonderful movie and the out takes at the end were a nice addition to confirm the story line.  I would highly recommend.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Usually, when my husband rents this type (sci-fi) of movie, I sit there with my book and read while he watches it.  This time it started out exactly the same, but pretty early into the movie, it caught my attention.  I was hooked.  This was a really, really good movie.  My kids were in and out of the room at the time and it seemed a little scary for them.  Otherwise, it was a great movie with a surprisingly deep message.  I recommend it!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I Loved this book as much as the first. Very quick read. Looking forward to the next one!  I would recommend this to anyone that enjoyed book one.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another great one by G5!!! Great story line along with awesome graphics. Keep these awesome games coming....they are worth every penny!!! We love them!!!
B00005N6KG|3.0|Use these for my workouts and they get thrown into my gym bag afterwards. I go through one of these almost every 6-9 months. They are not extremely durable because the wire leading into the earbuds eventually becomes loose and I end up losing sound in one ear bud, if not two, usually.  Unfortunately I am one of those who cannot use ear buds while working out because they pop out all the time when I run; thus, I'm stuck with using over the head headphones.  Fortunately they are cheap enough you can consider them disposable but it would be really nice if these were more rugged and durable.  Same problem occurs with other manufacturers of the same style headphone.  Audio quality is ok, not audiophile grade but does the job for a workout.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|NO Password Protection - One Click Always ON!! I email Amazon and they replied \\"at this time, the password feature is not available on Kindle app for Android\\". That is a terrible way to do business. It is very shady to try to get people to constantly buy things buy accident. They demand card information and then offer no protection once the app is on you phone or tablet. Anyone (including my children just trying to read their chapter book for school) could buy books accidentally. What a shady business strategy! I am VERY disappointed in you Amazon. I expected better from you. This is shameful exploitation of loyal customers.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you don't love this movie, you may not have a soul.<br /><br />Funny plot, lots of sexy girls (and guys, I guess) and music that could carry the movie by itself.<br /><br />What's not to like?
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book took me up and down with smiles and sadness too. I was eager to find out what happened next and just when I thought I knew the whole thing... something else happened! Good read!
B009POCG0Y|5.0|William Friedkin scared the pants off us with the classic THE EXORCIST.  Although there are no supernatural demons in KILLER JOE, the same visceral effect is achieved with this disturbing tale of the evil men do.  Based on a 1991 stage play, Friedkin hasn't just filmed a stage play.  Though mostly confined to a mobile home, the movie is so perversely hypnotic, you can't take your eyes off the screen.<br />Originally rated NC-17, KILLER JOE is brutal, violent, sexually repulsive, crammed with pervasive foul language.  Along with Friedkin's amazing direction,the movie's greatest strength is the stunning performance of Matthew McConnaughey as the vile title character.  Hints of his potential were evident in A TIME TO KILL, FRAILTY, THE LINCOLN LAWYER and even the flatulent MAGIC MIKE.,  But Matt proves there's more to him than picturesque pecs in this film.  He is riveting, repugnant and remarkable.  An Oscar nomination would be appropriate if more people had seen the film.  Kudos also to B-movie veteran Gina Gershon who is devastating and gives a whole new meaning to finger lickin good in one of the most disturbing scenes in recent film history.  This performance should open many doors for Gershon.  Thomas Haden Church is excellent as the addle-brained father/husband whose simple-mindedness masks an inherent evil---a volcano waiting to erupt.  Juno Temple as Dotty is as evil as Joe--in a pseudo-innocent manner.  She is quite chilling.  While Emile Hirsch is serviceable as ne'er do well Chris, he is overshadowed by the cast around him.<br />KILLER JOE is not an enjoyable film per se, it is a movie experience to admire and appreciate for its sheer audacity and the talent involved.
B00475BUVM|5.0|my grandson loved the movie, I did not watch this, but he said it was great and recommends this to all the action lovin' people
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I was expecting more on what Dr. Alexander saw in heaven and less about his new age philosophy. Christians should be disappointed when they read this book.
B005GSVFBE|5.0|this is a good movie for all ages, got it for my grandson, but all the family enjoyed watching the movie.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Every couple over 60 should see this movie!<br />Tommy Lee Jones is priceless.<br />You should be happy with me just checking how many stars for rating not writing 9 more words.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Liam Nelson puts on a good performance as an ex hitman, who takes his family abroad and then has to protect them from people who wished he was out of every picture.<br /><br />There are good performances by all of the actors in the movie.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|I enjoyed this odd yet funny movie regarding the romance between two young misfits and their equally misfit parents and cast.  I would give this 4 stars out of 7 but since I’m limited to 5, I’ll give it 3.  The scenery and music are very artistic and engaging but the movie never draws me fully into the plot.  The cute musical renditions during the final credits made me smile.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone how enjoys off beat romantic comedies such as Miramax created before Disney.
B002JIEYK8|5.0|I first got this album for Christmas. It's one of my favorite Black Sabbath albums. My favorite song from the album is Johnny Blade.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I use this on a Kindle Fire. It worked great until the latest update.  This version is in a format which has a lot of features I don't prefer,  not to mention the obvious flaws. The way this version opens is in a split screen which doesn't actually function very well. The button you use to navigate back from your subfolders is at the top left which not only doesn't flow well but is directly under the button for the Kindle notifications. The biggest problem to me is that the delete function has some kind of bug.  I have deleted an email and emptied the trash only to find it back in the folder. It has taken me literally up to a half dozen attempts to successfully delete. Yahoo please fix this!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|love spider on the Pc. this is the same great game to help pass the time. glad to have found it for my kindle.
B0015AARJI|5.0|PlayStation 3 Dualshock 3 Wireless Controller (Black) is your standard controller and theres not much else you can say about it.  Thing just works like its supposed to
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read this as a book club selection and although i was slow to get hooked, I eventually did. It is very well written and has endearing characters.
B008B7OQHM|4.0|My only complaint about this album is that essentially both disks are the same.  I got a dual disk album with 1 disk worth of songs.  The songs are great but this album instead of being a best of or a live album its both.  Not a bad idea but give me different songs on each disk will ya?  Theres almost no replay value to this album and I only got it because the online version was missing a song.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Picking up where Season 1 left off season 2 walks viewers through life in England during WWI and the affects of it at Downton Abbey.  A suedo mixture of Jane Austen and Gosford Park this is a series you can't help but get involved with the characters.  Some you will despise and some you will root for with affection. If you are an Amazon Prime member then you can view all the episodes on streaming for free.
B002PQ7JME|5.0|I love Mazzy Star. I think my favorite song from She Hangs Brightly is 'Free'. This is a really mellow vinyl to relax to with a glass of wine, if you're into that sort of thing. I highly recommend this one, happy listening!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you like family guy you will love this movie. If you like raunchy comedy this is a great movie for you.
B003IDMUSG|4.0|I am currently replacing my old paper books with Kindle and it is great fun re-discovering stories that you have not read for some time.  I suddenly realised that after ordering the 80th Book on the Kindle none of them was a Grisham.<br /><br />This was the one I decided to return to first and it was as great a read as the first time....  But I personally hate the end... I will not spoil it but whilst it makes sense I am a sucker for great closure in a book :-)<br /><br />However I know I will read this again!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this book!<br />I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves lots lots of twists and turns. Read it!
B00472NZDQ|4.0|Loved it, bringing back the same characters who are normally interacting in different ways and placing them together into one team is very powerful and creates a new dimension to the 'genre' of the normal characters.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Any one loved this awesome F1 driver this DVD is a total must, even if you were not a fan of his you will still enjoy it, or if you were to young to remember him race..Awesome tribute movie...Warning you might need the kleenex for the first viewing.
B0071BGOJC|3.0|I am a new Ken Follett reader and Fall of the Giants I went through very quickly... my kind of book with great Characters to get into, in many of Follett's books you can visualise the people and even understand that decisions they will make as the story unfolds.<br /><br />I have struggled to really get into this story and currently I have moved onto another book.  I know I will come back to the story  but it has not grabbed me as much as other books.  The opening German locations was great, but as the story has moved to the US I am finding it hard going to track who and what is happening.  I will update this review should I return to the book, after all the excitement of any book is what the next page says....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The style·The content·The characters·The emotion. I know I will be reading this book again and again, each time growing more attached to the characters. I publish i I could red it for the first time again.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book and can not wait to start the next book in the series.  Very well written!
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Pure garbage, didn't even work at all with my wireless Epson printer. if I could give it a minus star rating I would.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I had no clue how addicting this game would be! A simple little stickman, yet so much fun.....draw your guy and away you go.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is amazing in all the ways: Graphics Gameplay Even the things you buy with real $$$ is reasonably priced. Plus you don't NEED to buy anything! in my top 3 favorite games.
0439023483|5.0|Couldn't put down book 1 & 2, thought there was a little too much going on in 3 to process fast enough as I read.. If you've seen the movie, then read this book because the movie didn't do the book justice!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book! It kept you reading! I recommend. This book to kids and adults! I know adults and kids who love this series! If I enjoined this book you will!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|For those of you that have moved past the Schwartznegger/Rambo genre, this is a well produced and compelling true story that shows the better side of the human spirit.  The movie touches on a theme that is worth noting, that what we do to our children affects all the years of their lives.  King George (the stutterer) was abused in childhood and forced to switch from left to right handed by his overbearing father.  In stark contrast, the speech theripist showed that the best cures are those that are effected by the offering of compassion and friendship.<br /><br />Parents: do you want your children to be loving towards you and well balanced as adults, then don't abuse them as children.  And what's the worst form of abuse - verbal.
B009LRE040|5.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot.  It has all of the normal action expected from a Blockbuster and great filming.  This movie is not thought provoking or deep but just plain old fun and action.  The whole series has been fun to watch and this is a great end cap to the trilogy.
B009K45Y62|5.0|so glad i invested in this. it sold out everywhere and the prices it went for on ebay the day of release was ridiculous. I wouldnt trade my bat cowl for anything. An epic conclusion to the Nolan trilogy, and a great collector's item.
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's later novels.  She wrote about the satire of society and its effects on the chance of marriage.<br />Synopsis:<br />Anne Elliot has listened to friends and family when it comes to the men in her life.  Should marry them or not?  Anne met the love of her life Captain Wentworth earlier but was discouraged from pursuing him.  Will Anne be able to break away from her family and make her own decision about love and happiness?  Will society affect her choices?<br />My Thoughts:<br />I feel that classics are important, but I often have to give my full attention to it.  I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice but also have a greater understanding of the story.  I feel that I will come to appreciate Persuasion in time once I have given it more time.<br />Should we let marriage decide our future?  Does our family have our best interests at heart?  It is interesting that this marriage and family connections were so important back about one hundred fifty years ago.<br />I look forward to reading my next Jane Austen novel.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game was super fun and it kept me entertained. Love the G5 games and I can't wait for more!
B0047SF41G|4.0|While the tough guys just don't stack up to the caliber of tough guys in the original Predator movie, most of the characters are interesting and fun to watch.  Set in a jungle backdrop with plenty of new and familiar Predator action to keep even the most die-hard fan watching to the end.
B005XLN77O|3.0|My daughter finally showed an interest in Barbie so we started her off with a doll you could do more with than just dress. She really enjoyed the art aspect of these. The dresses are really low quality and feel barely more substantial than a dryer sheet but they were still fun and the doll has been durable enough and my daughter is really enjoying her.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We gave it to our 12 year old grandson and whaen he opened it he said awesome my friend has this and it is really challenging.Hard age to buy for if it is not electronics but he seemed pleased.
1609613937|5.0|Dr. McDougall writes a down-to-earth book on overall health and nutrition.  It is easy to read and understand.  He gets to the point quickly and backs it up with real science.  When we come to our senses, this is how people are going to live in the future. Read this book just to learn the truth.  Don't change anything about your diet.  If you just educate yourself you will have the knowledge to fix yourself when you are ready.  You can do it little by little if you want.  But in the end you can't cheat human biology and you will want the maximum health, wellness and beauty the starch solution will provide.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It is the best game ever ! I like this game because :  1) every week they make something new like for Christmas they make  different types of reindeer! 2) it lets you to complete lots of challenges. That's why you should buy this game.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love everything Ryan Murphy creates.  He is an amazing talent.  This is one of the best and most suspenseful shows I have ever seen.  I watch a lot of TV and I think that Ryan totally killed this genre.  The casting is outstanding.  Never really cared for Jessica Lange, just thought of her as another lucky Blonde, BUT in this series she deserves an award for each role she takes on.  I'm from Boston and I could not believe how well she handled the Boston Accent she really forget her &#34;r's&#34;. ( Watch out Meryl Streep) The supporting cast and guest actors are also fabulous.  I loved  Ian McShane's deranged Santa. James Cromwell is a monster and so creepy.  Ryan Murphy and his buddy Brian Falchuk are on the road to Hollywood History.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great story about triumph and tribulations! It made me laugh, it made me cry and made me believe in Hope!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game. I enjoyed it.<br />although it bugged out and I had to start all over. reinstall the game. so I lost everything.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Pretty fun, still just getting started though. It's a great way to kill time so far, especially for a free app
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was a great book. I have to see the movie(s). I am dying to see the first, second, and third when they are out.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|It was a great movie.  I enjoyed it very much.  They require too much to do this It makes people not want to rate
B003O86FMW|5.0|i think Catching Fire is the best book out of the three.  i have read them all and have the movie.  personoly i love all the books but in my opion catching fire is the best.  i love Suzanne Collins, i love how she describes the scenes and the characters and whats going on.  im a big fan!!  Team Peeta!!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|we all have to take turns to see who is ahead, now i have to set timer for all so we can play
B000JQUKKU|5.0|I don't remember downloading this book, but the story is a classical one. My guess is that it was downloaded to test the Kindle application on my phone.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|nice to have, bought it so my grandchildren can play with it. have some nice pics of them.  i think it should have been included, paid 199.  but thanks anyway, a fun thing for all of us.
B0051OZ564|1.0|Filmography and fight choreography ... annoying and unbelievable ( it looks like you are watching a badly done fake fight)<br /><br />Message ... there is none ... this movie doesn't say anything about anything.<br /><br />Yuck ... stay away ...
B000VHMF0A|5.0|Got this on sale even though I already own the original Legend CD.  Don't know how you could possibly go wrong with Marley...
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This product is eveyrthing as advertised.<br />Wish producers had more extras like interview, commentary, outtakes, or  scenes cut from fikms.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|I like the recipes that are included.  Not quite as well written as Born to Run, but its an interesting look at a phenomenal athlete nonetheless.
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Great bin for keeping barbie stuff.  the graphics are nice and the zippers are easy for my daughter to open and close. pleasantly surprised when I saw how big it was though it's a little pricey given it's a box with no other accessories.
0307474275|5.0|I love it. It is a nice book. I bought this for collection purpose.I have watched the movie based on this book.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I bought this case for my 14 year old daughter for Christmas and she loves it!  It seems very durable and we love how slim it is--and best of all this was an excellent price for this case! The only drawback so far is that her phone now won't fit on the docking/charging speaker station :(.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great ending to a fabulous trilogy, I couldn't put the book down since I started reading it. Thank you
B00846REIS|3.0|This book intrigued me after reading Fifty Shades. I liked it and plan to the buy the 2nd one. I'm eager to know Gideon's past. I would  recommend it. Pretty good story and a lot of sex. No S&M like Fifty Shades. If you are looking for that then this is your series.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I never got bored while reading this book. I would recommend it to anybody that likes battle, and suspense. I will definitely be reading more of this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I just love her writing style. The way she keeps your attention drawn the whole Tim  is why I am hooked.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think this game is fun it is addicting I do not get why you have to buy coins otherwise the game is great &lt;3 coin dozer :D ;D :)
B0091REZMW|3.0|Not too bad of a game.  However I do not like games that you have to purchase coins to complete missions.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I honestly don't know what to say about this book other than WOW!! It was a fun read. Looking forward to reading more selections by this author.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing!  I couldn't put it down.  It was beautiful and raw and I loved it.  Definitely a must read.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Staff Dr Congo and the other hand in the other side effects of climate change the other day that you can get the other hand in the most common type of climate change the most popular articles latest articles latest articles latest version of the other day that you can see how much money you can get!!!!!!!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I thought this was going to be somewhat light so we chose it for our Ladies Book Club. I don't believe that I have read such a moving story about life and its many twists and turns as this one since \\"The Corrections\\".  You will find yourself immersed in the walk that Harold Fry undertakes, and fighting tears as you realize why he chose to make such an implausible pilgrimage to save a friend. The author displays an uncanny understanding of people and our failed attempts at love and coming to terms with our many frailties. This is a story that will stay with you long after Harold's journey has ended.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I think this man could write a book of blank pages and I'd still give it a good look over.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'll keep this short.<br />First, if you have never read an Orson Scott Card novel, this one would be a fantastic start. It was my first and I absolutely loved it. So engaging and interesting.<br />Second, the plot seems very plausible to me, not because of the realistic setting but because of Card's incredible style of writing. I love sci-fi, no matter how far fetched, and Scott Card makes me like it even more.
B005HS00NW|4.0|Midnight City and Reunion are great songs, and some of the other songs have grown on me. The music reminds me of some New Wave music from the '80's. Some songs don't appeal to me though. In my view, if the best songs were selected and compressed to a single CD, it would be high quality and a must-buy.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I got this for $1.99, for a Christmas deal here on Amazon, and I can honestly say it is my favorite CD, and one of the best (if not THE best) deal/buy I have ever gotten on Amazon. I have listened to it countless times and have fallen in love with this band. Imagine Dragons is AMAZING. Dan Reynolds, the lead singer, has an amazing voice. Each song on this CD is unique and catchy.<br />HOWEVER, the only minor complaint I have about this CD is that it is not the full version, and is missing #12 \\"Fallen\\" and #13 \\"Working Man.\\" Not sure of these two songs are bonus songs only on the Deluxe version or not. I bought them separately, and love them both. I'd recommend buying them and listening to them if you haven't already.<br />My favorite songs on this CD are \\"Radioactive,\\" \\"Demons,\\" and \\"Bleeding Out.\\"<br />Overall, an absolutely amazing buy and deal. The deal is over now, but this music is worth it. To me, anyway. I LOVE it.<br />Thanks Amazon!!!!!!!<br />EDIT (1/12/13):<br />I was ;looking through my emails recently and discovered that I got an EVEN BETTER deal on this than I had originally thought. The entire CD was $0.24!!!! I apparently had some unclaimed promotional credit that I hadn't used!!! Made me so happy to see.<br />Also, I discovered another song that is not on this CD but is on some versions. \\"Cha-Ching\\" is only on the Spotify edition of this CD, and is also an interesting song. Not my favorite, but still good nonetheless.<br />EDIT (1/27/13):<br />For those of you wondering, two OTHER songs are also available for this album, \\"Selene\\" and \\"The River.\\" These songs are only available on the Best Buy exclusive edition of Night Visions.<br />EDIT (6/23/13):<br />It seems like my favorite songs from this CD are always changing. Each song has such a personality. Still in love with this CD, months after I bought it and months after I've seen them live in concert.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Incredible book!  It is very well written, never cheesy, funny, but heartbreaking.  I loved it and didn't want it to end.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|it's just what i needed. simple an on the spot. I needed a portable clock and this ones great to use.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great love it.......I am not a reader but I can read this book over and over. All three books are great and I can't until the movie..
030758836X|2.0|Bought the book for my husband because of a review he heard.  He read it but did not recommend that I read it.  Started it, didn't like it,  then gave it to library book sale.  This week it is number one on the local best seller list.
B009NPKTN6|1.0|There would have been plenty of music if this were a straight movie without being entirely done as a musical. So to put it bluntly, it scked. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B002BLZ6GE|5.0|This book is well worth the money spent..Anybody who plays guitar, or repairs them will find this book to be a great help.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was an excellent book with great action and believable characters. There are some gruesome parts that make you cringe and hope this plot never happens for real. But the story line in this book is one you can easily follow and get into. I recommend thus book to anyone 12 and up with a strong stomach.
B005HSL626|5.0|Well I really like love this game and One Direction have played it in real life before to so thats cool!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I am truly disappointed with this conclusion. The ending gives you enclosure, no feeling of good conquering bad. There was no glory in Katniss's finally. I almost feel bad for those about to read this. I wanted this to be a good ending. Instead it was. just depressing. The theme song for this book should be \\"suicidal\\". I recommend stopping with the first book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Enough of a challenge to be fun and hold my interest. Would like to try a few more of the games.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I feel like this book was not quite as good as the first one. There were some good ideas concerning the layout of the arena, but the plot wasn't as intriguing. You still like some characters but others lose there importance. This was weak in comparison to its predecessor. I didn't feel like I caught fire
B00A757EFW|5.0|Saw it  and who could resist a Free offer...! Bought me back to the countless  times we'd play on the huge arcade machines..very awesome to be able to indulge on my Kindle...
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We are a musical family, with a wide interest in different musical genre. Great, unique music... beautiful arrangements for well-known songs.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The most eerie and entertaining game I've played so far. It's both creepy but fun to play and addictive. I love it!
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Action, humor, and a cast that  never lets you down. All this in the sequel that doesn't feel like a follow up!
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|great
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Well done app! This app kept me busy for a while...then kept my 6 year old busy for a while.
0345803485|2.0|am into about 5 chapters and don't believe have read such a compilation of crud and lust i bought the book based on an amazon recommendation somewhere in the past guess that will teach me
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I love the idea of drawing your own game character. Also appreciate that you can redraw it since my first stickman was pretty lame. This is a cute game with silly fun puzzles. I am enjoying it.
B004H1V5RU|4.0|The Perplexus Epic is great.<br />I bought it for our 6 year old grandson and even though he likes it,<br />it is difficult for him.
B001OGWY1W|1.0|Violence, violence and more violence. What happened to mystery and suspense in movies? Give me a Hitchcock movie any day.
B008K8VDPU|3.0|I guess this gamesl is kind of fun but if u really want a fun game check out piano master
B00APUQH0W|3.0|If you enjoy Clint Eastwood, you will enjoy this one.  It will not wow you, but, there are very likable characters in the story.  Definitely worth the time and rental.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|My personal favorite as a Christmas movie!  Outstanding performance by the three stars, and should be a staple for those with old-fashioned faith and family values.
030758836X|5.0|I was totally entranced. I purchased it after hearing the author on Face the Nation! New one for me, but an entirely enjoyable read. Funny and engrossing.
B001TODCII|5.0|my husband loves this movie. I think it is too scary, but I bought it for him for chiristmas. Don't watch it with your girlfriends. haha
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Bought on amazon because of the price.  Walmart was selling the DVD set for $35 and Target same.  I ended up getting Amazon Prime direct download for the portability. The only downside I have found with this is that Amazon Prime TV is not compatible with AirPlay on my iPad. But luckily amazon prime works seamlessly with my xbox360 so trouble watching.
B0085Z3B2Q|4.0|this movie is just okay to me. I think it is a little boring and I don't like the music in it, but my kids like it. Nothing compared to despicalble me though. That movie is awesome.
B008BQE56A|4.0|only box set with older blues faves and bob welch era tracks,all in all nice collection from just about every early album
B003O86FMW|5.0|Unbelievable. I could not put the book down and now I am on to book 3. I cannot go too far in my praise of this series.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Bought my 6 year this (and a few other things including a tablet) for Christmas and this is all she wants to play with. Might pick up another soon.
B00APUQPX6|4.0|Although it didn't have as detailed a plot as the first two, it was still \\"Ice Age\\" entertaining! Personally, I think the critics are nitpicking and take thinks to seriously and out of context.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Very nice quality. Have had several comments about it at work already. Not your traditional plastic clip on case which is nice!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|Nothing special here, I didn't read the book but this story has already been told many times before. Not very original.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford & Sons does not disappoint! I recommend this album highly. M & S fans will love it as much as the last!
B0095R64AO|1.0|Wife and I were searching for something new to watch on a Friday night. We both liked Jason Segal and &#34;Forgetting Sara Marshall&#34; and thought this might have similar humor. We were surprised how bad this movie was. The story is all over the place and not very well executed. Bad chemistry between the actors. It was just bad. Don't waste your time.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|As there are already countless detailed reviews of this album - not to mention the excellent essay by John Harris above - I won't go into too much of a detailed analysis, but simply state that even having bought this album when it was released nearly a year ago, it stills shakes me to the core. I can think of no other concept album that succeeds on so many levels - lyrically, musically, vocally, etc. Harvey is at the top of her game here, becoming not only a musician and songwriter but something resembling the poet-historians of ages past.<br /><br />The arrangements and production are perfect, as is nearly everything about this album (including the accompanying film available on Youtube and now on DVD). This is one of those rare albums that must truly be \\"listened to\\" (i.e. not as background music or on earbuds whilst riding the subway, flipping through a magazine or reading a book). I feel as though I've raved enough (at least much more than I intended to), but this is the kind of piece of art that I can see being studied in an academic environment - it's that intense, relevant, and ground-breaking.
B00846REIS|5.0|Love it!  Keeps you on edge and so sad you have to wait for the next book to come out . If you like 50 shades then you'll LOVE this!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|sorry for all that update :( and thanks too all reviews :)<br />so I thot the game was awesome so thanks too the things of information about the update :)
B007CKNX28|4.0|A great little album from Jack White.  As you'd expect, it has his signature sound throughout his career (White Stripes, Raconteurs) with some great licks and solid drum work.  If you like the White Stripes or Raconteurs, I definitely recommend this album.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm gonna buy it wen I get thetime but this game is awesome I played my friends so this game is amazing so buy it its for good builders or survivel people
B004WR125O|4.0|Just plug it in to a compatible amp, fire up the app and discover the device on your network. No configuration needed really, unless you want to specify network address via the remote on the receiver.<br />The one thing I will say is the range seems sort of limited, but overall it works well.
B0083DJWGO|5.0|What separates Antifragile from his previous works is that his writing is immediately applicable.  There's waiting/wading through 75% of the book to get the good stuff.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game but no matter what I try to do it will not open up on the computer. Can't get it to download
B005Z28M58|5.0|I have got my mom a seasion every holiday for the past 7 holidays dont know what to get her now for the next one, she loves them great show.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Breathtaking, beautiful, mind blowing. This is my all time favorite movie. The first time I watched this, I was about 8 and it made me cry so  much, it scared me but I fell in love with it. This film, in my opinion, is one of Mizaki's greatest masterpieces. I cannot find the words to describe how this movie leaves me breathless after every single time I watch it. The characters are absolutely lovable (even the mean ones) and the plot is fascinating.  Hayao Miyazaki really outdid himself in this one. I think Spirited away touched me a little more than his other movies. His films take me to another world. I also highly recommend the movie \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" it is astonishing. Spirited Away AND Howl's Moving Castle are totally worth the time and money if you are willing. My biggest thanks to Hayao Miyazaki for creating such a heart-stirring and warming adventure. Absolutely astounding.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a great sci fi book! I literally couldn't put my kindle down.  I felt like I was there with the<br />Stranded astronaut. It is a compelling fight for survival and I would recommend it to any sci fi fan.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read this book in two days, shocked with every chapter. I am looking forward to finishing the other two books!
B003TNM2K6|3.0|The thing that gripes me most about Stephen King adaptations is that they don't trust the master.  Dreamcatcher, great movie, right up until the end.  The Mist, great movie right up until the end.  Do these Hollywood twinkies really think they can outmaster the master?  Seriously, the ending of King's \\"The Mist\\" is fraught with tension, as our crew picks up a stray radio transmission that suggests there might still be human life on earth.  The movie version, while fine in many respects, totatlly scotches the ending....seriously?  Spoiler alert.  He kills everyone in the car including his own son and then finds out that the earth has been saved?  Puhhleaze.  What a huhk of junk. If these Hollywood morons would just follow King's work, we might have some damned fine movies.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride is a pretty good game overall,but could use better graphics.Works a lot better on Ipad than Kindle fire.
B0015DROBO|5.0|An entirely good book but it was hard to get through the first chapter. Great story line and leads into another story.
B000002IGP|5.0|Very low pricing and condition was better than the sellers description. Very fast delivery as well. Thank you for having what I was looking for and a great price!
B009DCOU9S|3.0|up.After struggling through 3chapters. I was almost to the end and it will not pick up the objects that I need. very disappointed.
0307887448|5.0|Interesting read. Nice insight into the formation of relationships in online settings, and a really neat edge-of-your-seat adventure along the way. Been on a kick of this sort of thing recently with Sword Art Online and Ready Player One. Snow Crash is up next. (i may be going about this in reverse order).
B009NPA3MS|4.0|the wife reaillylikes this. but to me it's just phillip.<br />but yes i would say buy it because it grows on you just alittle
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My three boys and I have competed for this book for several weeks now, resulting in a second version in paper.  If I hurry, I might be able to get a head start on the 2nd book before anyone notices.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I have read other reviews which describe battery charging and idle problems on the Kindle Fire after install. I downloaded the free version of this app a few days ago, and so far so good. Nice GUI with simple functionality. Useful information on load draining, and audible charging alerts are helpful.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|The movie was not great but it was watchable.  I think I expected more since I liked the idea behind the movie. I loved the original but I was twelve when I saw it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Loved the game. Very interesting. Bought the full version. Very entertaining.  But... I got stuck in the managers office. Couldn't find the key to the cupboard. Which holds an important piece to the game. Read the included walkthrough and it says nothing about a key. Had to read reviews to find out its in the book on the desk.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|I have the other bourne movies, but i didn't like this one. it was poorly made the story was there, just not fully developed

B005LAII3U|3.0|I love sci fi so for me this is an own it kind of movie, but even then it was still just ok, everyones acting is a bit off but passable.  Rent it if you like it buy it, otherwise you will have lost 3.99 at the most?
B007TNS6JI|3.0|Good all around<br />Good graphics &amp; game play...love the dungeons &amp; maps...Good for the tablet<br />A must get for the kindle
B009JBZH54|5.0|As I said love batman, and this third version is very dark and comic like, the other 2 are ok explain alot but I want more of this batman. The one that rises !
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I plan to use this for my timer. not necessarily for waking up. and yes, for the bad reviews, there is instructions. click options, scroll all the way down, and press help &amp; more. its a great toll for what I need.  :)
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome!! Hard to believe its over. Is there a relaunch coming? I hope so! Long movie but well worth it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft . Everything is perfect, but there is one thing I desperately need.....fish, I can make so much like aquariums, I can put glass floor over the water full of fish. That would be awesome. The only thing I ask, is fish. Please, I need fish.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Well written although it did seem to move slow at times. I am looking forward to reading the complete series, in the order it was published.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|From the jump you realize that the Alabama Shakes are not your average new-found, pop-rock band burning up the charts.  Their sound is as if...just picture Janis Joplin singing lead for the Black Keys in 1960's Alabama.  The lead singer's voice (a woman) is so soulful, and unique. I love that in bands. She sings with so much passion and grit...if you like bands with a unique sound and inspiring music, then I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Boys and Girls by the Alabama Shakes.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|For those that were disappointed with her album releases post-Rated R, this makes up for it. She's back to the edginess and pushing boundaries.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|This is one of my favorite CD's...just love the songs makes you want to dance and sing with them...wish I sounded as good as them.  HA
B008ASLK8A|3.0|The movie took forever to establish the full storyline. There was also way too much talking occurring in this one. Liked the first movie much more than this one.
B001AG52AG|1.0|I almost turned this movie off.  I think they could have made a good movie.  You can tell the story was based on a book with an actual plot.  This movie had none of the elements of plot normally associated with a story.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie didn't even have good special effects.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Pretty good take on Snow White. Everyone played their roles well. Charlize Theron definitely rocked her part as the evil queen.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I had a great time with book, I loved all the physics and math.<br />Plus the story lines kept me on the edge of my seat.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|As always, the mission impossible saga has delivered! Full of action and some new and old faces. Great for a couch day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i absolutely enjoy playing this game. so does my fiancee and her twin sister and their nieces. excellent way to pass time and keep entertained.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is awesome and I play it a lot I love the orange bird because it is so big I don't like the red bird because it does not do lot lot
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|The ideas are kept nice and simple and relevant.  Highly recommend this book as the anti-Dilbert way of doing business
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"Sometimes you have to choose between a bunch of wrong choices and no right ones. You just have to choose which wrong choice feels the least wrong.\\"<br /><br />WOW. I'm not sure truer words were ever spoken.<br /><br />This book had me emotional. There were times when I was 'guessing' what was going on and I'm like \\"No way...there's just no way\\". Sky and Holder are amazing together. I can't help but wonder...where were guys like him when I was 17? I wish they existed! Alas...back to book life....<br /><br />This book was so thought provoking and there is so much that you don't see coming and so many links in the chain of events. Colleen Hoover hit this one out of the freaking park. This book is #1 for a reason, and that's because it deserves it.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|i find this game boring and not much of a challenge. i prefer word games much more as they require a lot more thought!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|I will never look at my teddy bear the same way again!  I recommend this movie to anyone with a sense of humor!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|American Sniper was a great informational read, about just what our hero's had to do to keep our country safe.<br />I would recommend this book to be read by all in Washington.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Fun to play when just hanging around. I like that it is a puzzle and makes me think unlike other games.
0547258305|5.0|I am in love with Kristin's writing style. From the very beginning of the story she entranced me and I couldn't put it down. Definitely a new favorite on my shelf.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews about this recording and ..... I have had this recording for a long time and ..... there are few artists that can dream up stuff like this and.... Yes this is a GREAT !!!!!!!!! piece of work. Being a HUGE Zappa fan, very few people have this kind of mind. This is BRILLANT !! If you \\"don't get it\\" you know nothing about music. !!, continue to buy your music by so called \\"artists\\" that cannot write, read music or even play an instrument.
630471193X|5.0|John Travolta is one of my favorites and he does a great job with this movie.  It runs the gambit of emotions:  happy, sad, rooting for the good guy and making you treasure every day of your life.  Highly recommend!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My five year old grandchild enjoys this all as much as I do!  It is very easy to get addicted to playing it.
B000L212HC|5.0|Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman do a great job in this movie!  Keeps you watching from beginning to end.  Highly recommend!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|in time of just so so movies this one was great. Most now days are action so just one thing after another or some dumb comedy that never make me laugh just are stupid. Or often very sad if one thinks about it.<br /> This was one had great dialogue as well as the actors to bring it out.  I was pleasantly surprised to see Justin is becoming a better than just okay actor and did not get the role just for his previous fame.<br />Both my husband and I enjoyed it so i is one of those movies that appeals to both adults in your family and i would think of all adult generations.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Fringe makes all unbelievable things believable.  Great storylines and talented actors.  Walter the Father is one of my favorites. A must buy!
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game is nooo fun unless you are willing to spend your $.  If your not..then be prepared for SLOW progress in the game.. for example...32 hours before being able to breed one dragon..keeping in mind that you most likely won't get the one u want! Every 32 hours to breed one fricken dragon! However before even breeding... you have to buy its habitat first (25-500 gold bars)..then to place the habitat you have to clear up some land which requires up to 25 maps you have to obtain from other players u added to your neighborhood..once you have the maps then you can clear up a patch of land big enough for the habitat..OH BUT WAIT! The land has bushes that need to be removed..about 3 to 4 (each bush can take up to 24 hours to be removed). After all that..it litterally took me 354 tries for a dragon. In order to speed up the wait..I had to pay 64 gold bars for each try! AFTER u get the dragon you wanted ...at last! You need to BUY farms to BUY food to grow your dragon...all many long hours and plenty of gold for each 4 levels of aging. Get the gist? THE frustration takes away every ounce of fun u thought you would have...TOtal RIP-OFF! Note: they put \\"spend gold bar?\\" buttons in areas your likely to hit accidently while playing (no confirmation requests afterwards) One hit and its spent and sorry...no refund even when personally emailed to the creaters...After waiting 2 weeks, you will get this auto response: Sorry.. no exceptions considered! Don't play this crappy game!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Well written and the &#34;Guys&#34; are the greatest!  The premise of good against evil is very believable and each episode makes you want those two good guys to win while keeping you loving each storyline!
B002ZBN13A|4.0|I bought the album for the song haunted the rest of the toons on here are awesome not disappointed and for 5 bucks how could you go wrong.
B0053O89YM|5.0|The Goodwife is one of the best series on Television!  The storylines are very good and the actors are great!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This collection of songs by the legendary Bob Marley has so many hits on it one would be foolish NOT to pick it up!  'THREE LITTLE BIRDS', 'ONE LOVE', 'REDEMPTION SONG', and 'WAITING IN VAIN' are four of my ALL TIME favorite songs in ANY musical genre, and they are ALL right here in this one collection - AMAZING!!  You cannot go wrong picking this one up...  LOVE IT!!
B0058YPILY|5.0|Of course, I have seasons 1 through 6.  All of them great!  Season 7 is one of my favorites.  All the storylines keep you guessing and are so believable.  The actors are very talented.  A must buy!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this book! First loves and drama. I couldn't put it down.From beginning to end it held my attention
0547564651|5.0|This book made me wish for a shot at a parental do-over. Though its focus is on improving the prospects of disadvantaged kids, any parent or teacher, no matter the socio-ecomonic level, will richly profit from lessons imparted by Paul Tough. Though others have objected to the impressionistic approach, I found it engaging and, ultimately, cohesive. I ordered gift copies of How Children Succeed for a niece who's a new mother and a young friend getting his master's in teaching. This book matters, and one can only hope it will make a difference.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My son was very happy with this gift.  We all enjoy the series.  I plan to purchase the other season copies.
B0063GORYU|3.0|This game is a bit boring.  One begins to wonder if it is worth the time. its okay for free but I wouldn't. want to pay for it.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|The Nikon 1 system impressed me and it has done it again. This adapter fits without a hitch. I tried using a lens not on the list as far as compatibility. The Tamron 70-300mm VC works and that is a bonus. I do however have the Nikon 55-300mm lens as well and all I can say is... WOW. I see no hint of chromatic aberration at all shooting foliage covered with snow. Using my other non-AF-S lenses the camera shows it being MF only. Hit the OK button and focus the lens with the expanded view of your subject. This makes focusing very easy. I used my primes, the 28mm 2.8, 35mm 1.8, 50mm 1.8 and 85.18. All in all very good images captured. I am so pleased to have the added range of my 300mm with the 2.7 crop factor making it an 810mm lens. Simply awesome!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a great book and a good page turner. I`ve read quite a few on my new Kindle and this has a lot of twists and turns and it is very refreshing to actually be surprised throughout the book and not the typical format or ending!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I read this novel in several hours. It was addicting, almost as much as the main characters in this story. So many times I found myself playing detective, certain I had figured out the next move, the next twist, the perfect conclusion. Not even close.<br /><br />If after reading this novel you don't feel even a 4 star rating is deserved- you are just as hard to please as the antagonist of the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this app. I'm trying to get the high score I just love this person I love him so much
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was such an amazing book. I laughed and cried. I don't think I've ever loved a book so much like I did this one.
B008LY9AWG|2.0|Ended rather abrubtly. Confusing ending that I didn't care for. Ususally like Mr. Connelly work but would not recommend this
B00AKO93JK|3.0|The workout is good but doesn't allow you to start moderate to advanced. Also doesn't give you enough time to switch over to the new exercise segment. Overall it's ok.

B004LWZW8I|3.0|Mickey Rourke is excellent in his part. Good story line. Just a little too bloody. The screen was a little darker than comfortable in places but it did not deter from the movie.
B000002O4X|5.0|I love this soundtrack, and only had it on an old cassette, was happy to find Amazon had the CD, and bought one for a Christmas gift and one for myself.  Have played and re-played it over the past couple of weeks, beautiful music, relaxing and great memory of the film as well!
B009MF5BXK|5.0|Lots of 'one liners'.  The more times you watch it the better it gets. So much action and so many stars. Jason Staman as usual is great as well as Willis, Stalone, Lundren, and Arnold. So many stars. Each and every one shines in their own right. And then there is CHUCK. You will know the minute he walks in. Love that man!  I am ready for #3 now.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|No just no. Seriously Seriously of all books to include with my kindle you give me not 1 but 2 dictionarys
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This won't let you down if you are a Jason Bourne enthusist. Full of action and suspense. Keeps you on your seat all the way.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Love this book so much don't know what I would do if this where me I would probably live my life the same way she did
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars + but it has a little too much 'drama' for me. The &#34;action&#34; was awesome. Just would have like more of the male dancing and less of the story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Breathtaking enjoyment, a must read & a guarantee suggest to all my friends!!!!!!! More books please...EL James very superb author
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This one is a little softer starting out but once he gets cranked up it really gets to going. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the Batman.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is the best I've read so far. I can't wait to read the next book. I hope it is great!!!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Awesome movie and I can just imagine the entire story going down in Franklin County, VA. My family has roots in that era and I have heard stories  from my grandma about the bootlegging business. I suspect there is more truth than fiction here.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Overall I found the movie to be entertaining but in several parts the dialouge was so soft and low I had to turn up the volume to hear what they were saying, then BLAM the volume was too loud.  I sat with the remote in my hand to adjust the volume on different scenes.  Not a bad movie, but I doubt I'll add this one to my collection.
B003DFJW9E|5.0|This soundtrack is really fun to listen to! It brings back great memories from the movie and flows incredibly well. Hans Zimmer at his best!
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|I loved the beginning and the end, but was a tad bored with everything else.  But I'm sure the kids will love it.  The animation and the colors were top notch.
B006FYHTFO|4.0|I love this soundtrack because I really enjoyed the movie. However, I do not care for the layout of the soundtrack. The order of the tracks seems a bit choppy to me. It makes great background music, but I prefer the soundtrack to the first movie.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love the show and have really enjoyed the 5th season so far.  They have given the show some new twists while getting back to the basic format of solving crimes.  I am also a huge Firefly/Serenity fan and follower.  So I just love the references and underhanded jokes back to that show by the writers/actors of Castle.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack is an excellent companion to the new motion picture. I love the story, and I believe the cast does a remarkable job in remaining true to the story's message.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|lovely coming-of-age girl-as-warrior story.  i especially enjoyed the animation of the bear fur and red hair.  love to see more heroines.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT KEPT YOU GUESSING THROUGHOUT THE BOOK. OF THE TWO I<br />HAVE READ THIS WAS MY FAVORITE.  I RECOMMEND THIS SERIES TO ANY ONE WHO LOVES SUSPENSE AND THRILLERS.
0143117009|5.0|This well written dense book is surprisingly readable due a conversational style.  The intensity of the subject matter creeps up on you leading this reader to a more pessimistic conclusion than the author.  Having been written before the near economic collapse and the endless political stalemate, the intention seems to suggest that hope is out there.  About 6 years post-publication, it is unclear if Diamond would still see a positive outlook ahead.  It is a thought provoking well researched book that holds relevance despite the changes that have transpired over the years.
1401937519|3.0|I found Anita's early life and NDE interesting, but the book kind of waffled after that.  I guess it was hard to convey her experience in mortal words, as many other NDE people have found.  I found my mind wandering a lot and wishing the book would finish up.  I believe in God and the bible, something scarcely mentioned in the book.  I had just finished reading 'Proof of Heaven' by Dr Eben Alexander and noticed the basic theme of both was 'unconditional love' which was nice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Who knows our future might  not be so different. I can't wait to read the next book in the trilogy.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Grandchildren love this game and it's free so that makes it even better. Even my four year old loves playing with his sisters kindle fire Thanks Amazon !!!
B0060MYKTY|1.0|It's a relief to finally know that the US will be getting a DVD/Blu-ray release.  It'd be even more of a relief to know when the actual date of the release is.  The first season came out last December, so I was hopeful that that would be the case with the second season.  Not so, apparently.  My guess is that the release will likely follow the trend of most shows and occur in the month before or the month of the premiere of the new season (i.e. March or April in The Borgias's case).  Will keep my fingers crossed but I'd much rather Amazon put me out of my misery with a definitive date.<br /><br />1/7/2013:  A release date has been provided.  Thanks, Amazon.
B00867GHS8|5.0|a must movie to add your 3D movie collection.flawless transition to a 3d Movie.great depth and clarity awaits you in this Gem
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|I really liked the raunchy humor.  Once in a while it is funny.  So watch it but not with children or teens.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|Very thought provoking video. Should stir up some good discussion for a social studies class. Wether you agree or disagree with Al Gore, it should make you think.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I strong recommend for those who are actually wanting to get education about their food or how it's made/treated.  Eye opener for sure.
0790733226|5.0|I love this movie! Makes a person think a little bit about the possibilties of life outside our own little world.
B001992NW4|5.0|I'm giving this 5 stars because it is a great Blu/Ray set! This is one of my favorite movies. Cool Set!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|easy to follow story line, with the normal excitement of a Clancy book. I enjoy all of the Clancy fictional books.
B006PGL7OQ|5.0|Take Shelter is a psychological drama about a man Curtis, and his family. Curtis begins having these awful dreams at night that depict a strong storm that ravages all life seen in the movie. Curtis has to choose between his instinct, and his family. The movie is based upon the great split between following instincts and abandoning instinct for social acceptance. The movie is very slow paced, but it works well to make you feel closer to Curtis, like you understand exactly how he feels. This movie is remarkable on many levels. The screenplay is excellent, it strays as far away from cliches as possible, and boasts an epic, and intense climax that will leave you thinking about our society, and how we sometimes have to abandon instinct to be accepted by others, even loved ones. Critics praise this movie for it's intensity and it's epic feel, but I like this movie because it sends the viewer many messages about many topics that we deal with in our lives. This movie is very well acted, and many were surprised that Michael Shannon (Curtis) won no Oscars or Golden Globes for his performance, despite many very respectable critics such as Roger Ebert saying he deserved an Oscar. He carries this movie on his shoulders and holds it to glory.<br />Story- 10/10<br />The story is very intense, and very well written. There are almost no predictable moments, and this movie contains little to no cliches, which together, is an accomplishment for modern film. Very slow moving, and certain scenes seem to drag on, but it doesn't hinder the great screenplay.<br /><br />Acting- 5/5<br />The movie is very well acted. Michael Shannon delivers a powerhouse performance better than many of those that win the Oscars every year. Michael Shannon provides a believable, and touching performance that leaves you feeling like you actually knew Curtis. Jessica Chastain co-stars and also does an amazing job with her role as Curtis' wife, and in depicting how someone would act if their significant other was beginning to sound like he/she is crazy to you. The daughter also does an unbelievable job, and there is no doubt that she also contributed to the depth of the acting.<br /><br />Effects- 5/5<br />The effects are astounding. Breathtaking even. Most of the effects used were during the dreams that help paint out a huge apocalyptic storm. The effects were used seamlessly without being overused or overdone. Very good use of lighting to set mood as well as an astounding soundtrack that touches the soul, giving it an intense, slightly mysterious, and epic feel to it. All effects of all sorts were used here to the best I have seen in any movie in a while.<br /><br />Presentation- 4.5/5<br />Take Shelter is presented beautifully, and perfectly. There is no better way it could have been presented. The acting was phenomenal, the effects were stunning, but not overdone, the cinematography was well done and the writing is a masterpiece. However one small thing takes away a half a point, and that is the pace. The pace is agonizingly slow. It serves it's purpose well, but to some it may be just too slow. To me it is personally not bad, but to someone else it may mean a lot to their opinion of this movie.<br /><br />Overall- 19.5/20<br />Take Shelter is a masterpiece. Plain and simple. It has no flaws in my eyes with the exception of pace that will only bother some, not all, which is sadly, the only thing keeping this movie from a perfect score. This movie boasts superb acting, phenomenal effects, brilliant writing and a lot to think about afterwards. I highly recommend this movie to all. It is a low budget, not very well known movie that deserves sooo much more credit for it's accomplishments in film making. In my eyes, this is one of the greatest films ever made, and coming from me, a movie connoisseur to the definition, is saying a lot. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.
B00846REIS|5.0|I read this after reading shades.. Which I read in like a week.. I wanted more and googled books like shades.. This was the first and honestly, I was skeptical but got into it and was HOOKED!!! Couldn't put it down as well and now I'm waiting for book 3 to download in May! This is similar to shades but what I loved about it is it seemed a little more realistic. Gideon and Eva are less inhibited so the drawn out character build up was not needed! I loved Eva's spirit!!! I loved Gideon!!!! All I can say is everyone needs a little Gideon in their life!! Mmmm mmmm mmmm.. If your just looking for a good read, juicy read, something after shades or even by itself... Sylvia Day is great!!!! Love her books this series got me ready for more and I've read other books.. I like her style!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|In love with this trilogy! Hopefully I'm able to find more like it :)  it's a good introduction to BDSM.
B00838HSYM|1.0|As others have mentioned, I bought this as a Christmas gift only to find that it will not work in either of my Blu Ray players.  It states that it is region B2 but I must have overlooked it (honestly, I didn't think to check since I was ordering through the USA site).  We are stuck with a great movie that we can't even watch.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|This book keeps you on your feet. It has many twists and turns that will excite you from beginning to end! I enjoyed every word!!

B007THA4FI|5.0|ROWLING writess an unforgettable tale showing that she is a multiple genre weaver of attention holding stories that have not only strong story elements but also true to life characters who keep the reader turning the pages. I look forward to her next endeavor.  This book is an excellent read.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and son love this game. They play in friendly competition to beat each others score (son is winning). Looks great and works well on the Kindle Fire.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Easy to see; easy to use. It rarely gets better than this, especially for free. I am glad to have this app.
B0061S073A|5.0|I have a 7yr old. This is a easy to use app to protect him from getting into places on the tablet hes not allowed. I love that it asked for a password for everything except just to play the games I picked. Also great when it asked for your password... There is the Hint below. Great for forgetful people like me, but be cautious don't want to give away the secret.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Pitch Perfect.<br /><br />Great movie, lots of fun & laughs. I watched this with my family & enjoyed every moment. I would recommend to a friend.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I really like this app for the Kindle Fire. I have it on the Apple iPhone and it is about the same so super easy to understand and use.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This movie is a must if you were born in the 70s & ever watched the original Flash Gordon. It took me by total surprise, I had not laughed that much in a while. The only thing that bothered me about this movie is that I had not viewed it sooner.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love myself good ol fashion Solitaire games. I can play this all day, much more fun on my Kindle Fire then on my Apple iphone.

B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great solitaire game for Kindle Fire. Only complaint is sometimes the tiles get too small and I have a hard time seeing them. Not all the boards are like that, just a couple (so far).
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|in good condition and as described...glad I didn't pay more, it was not the story I expected. Rather bazarre treatment of this historical event.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well since I have purchased this game I have not seen my son. It took us some time to understand it, but he loves playing it. He rather play on the Kindle Fire than on the computer.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Totally kept me reading and rooting for her! Loved the twist at the end! Definitely surprised me! Would recommend this book for sure.
B005COO1X6|5.0|I can really identify with this one. My car is from another planet too, And it ate all the money out of my wallet.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|'The Martian' is a well written sci fi, unlike any others that I have read. It is a story of one man's survival on the surface of Mars, and the race to put together a mission from Earth to save him.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I liked this book.  I really thought Ms. Dugard's voice was clear through the whole novel and there was not really much of that &#34;ghost writer&#34; polish.  It was a tad slow at times but I enjoyed reading about her.
B005LAII12|3.0|The previews were fine but the feature presentation had a problem. I need to return it and I just didn't want that extra burden. I always buy from amazon and will continue!
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book is very good and is action filling. I recommend this book for all the fans of Percy Jackson.<br />But Rick Riordan, your books are not as good as they used to be...<br />.
B002VECMAO|3.0|This movie was a disappointment. Being a Clooney fan, it just didn't get it done this time. Not enough goat staring
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was one of the best books he's written yet<br /> I very much enjoyed this book<br />I hope he continues to make diary of a wimpy kid
B005LAIHGI|5.0|You have to like off the wall comedy to really appreciate this film. Sacha Cohen's humor is at it's best in this film
B005K17RU0|4.0|Weather weather weather weather weather weather weather. No blip to small no flip to big. Happy happy hour joy. Poop
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love Rick Riordan's Heroes of Olympus series and Mark of Athena did not disappoint. I find myself right there with them on their journey. I can't wait for the next book.
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I truly was in the beginning because I'd read the other books by this author and truly enjoyed them. The sample held promise of more of the same.<br /><br />Then it went wrong for me. Characters who start out strong become contrived or dropped altogether. The BFFs are reduced to prop holders. And the unfolding \\"drama\\" plain and simple went over the top, which is sad because the issues are quite real for too many in this society. For that reason, they needed to be dealt with in a way that didn't read like a \\"what can I do next for shock value?\\" The story rapidly plummeted for me. I can't help placing some of the blame on her critique partners and beta readers. A little honesty goes a long way, that's all I'm saying.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I read Sea of Tranquility afterward.<br /><br />I can't imagine the pressure of trying to come up with the \\"next\\" when you've had prior solid success (I will say I took way less issue with the similarities between Slammed and Easy, though it was duly noted in my databank) but I believe this author has the ability to write fresh characters in an original story.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This was purchased as a gift, dark knight trilogy.  The one who received it was delighted, as he is a fan of such superhero movies.  Met my expectations for sure.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game...like a farmville Oregon trail cross.....fun!<br />You don't travel in the wagon much but the hunting and fishing is still there...lots of tasks to complete
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|If you enjoy Clint, you'll enjoy this. Beware heavy language and racial slurs, but a very good message.  One of my favorite movies.
1419705849|5.0|the book was very good it was a present for a relative but i could have bought it for less than half the price at sainsburys
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'd heard so much hype about this show that I ordered Seasons 1 & 2 to get caught up in order to watch the new season coming up shortly.  I have fallen completely under it's spell!!  My husband & I have had a &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; marathon over the New Year's holiday--MUCH better than dealing with crowds in bars & restaurants!  I HIGHLY recommend this series & can't wait to see the new season!
B009JBZH54|5.0|These three movies are the best Batman movies ever. The cast of all three was excellent. So glad I ordered them.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The whole family loves this app! My 5 year old needs a little help but loves drawing and catching everything on fire! Their grandparents love that is challenging and clean for the grandkids. I have and will continue to recommend this app to everyone.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This is a great performance by Whitney and shows off her amazing voice!  I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies and great singing!
B004SMD4H2|4.0|I would have given this product a 5 except for one thing...packaging.  I love the show itself and its never a dull moment.  I was dissappointed in the inner packaging and how the discs are held in place.  The discs are hard to get in and out because of the way they are packaged.  Its hard to explain.  You have to slide the disc down really hard to get it below the two side holders.  There is always the fear of scratching, chipping or even breaking the disc.  A great show like this should be treated as such in all aspects.  The second season discs are stacked two each on top of each other with a spindle which is better.  I would still recommend Haven highly to anyone that loves paranormal mystery and intrigue.
B00005KAQP|5.0|This DVD is great with non-stop entertainment!  She is a great comedian and this movie I would recommend to anyone!  This is a movie you will watch over and over again!

B003IMV8IK|5.0|Jennifer can heat up the room! There are song's with lyric's that need an &#34;R&#34; rating, sooooo sexy!! Then you are transported to a completely different style of music that just keep's coming. Caution...do not listen to this CD alone!!

B00008EY7H|5.0|My husband is French Canadian and Allegria is his fave of all. Too bad they don't make blu-ray version. I would've buy that instead.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good story, just wanted different ending or more and another twist. Overall book had lots of twists and was well done.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is awesome if you like mystery, hidden objects and puzzles. I loaded this game on my Kindle Fire this morning. I had to stop to let my device charge up again :) I wish it would hurry up. If you get stuck on any part they have hints to help. You will enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a great continuation of the story.  I cannot wait to be able to read the third book in the series.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This novel was energizing and riveting, yet a wonderful mindless and entertaining read. Loved every minute and the sleepless nights.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|A must read!! Twilight fans look out! I could not put this book down! Imaginative! Gripping! I cannot wait for the sequel!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is like warming up your brain. I didn't think I was going to like it but it kept my attention for a fair amount of time.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I ordered this for Christmas for my daughter.  She had already seen the movie in the theater and specifically wanted the DVD.  Great movie.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This film is a wonderful addition to anyones collection. I recommend it. Yet another good find amoung so many bad films these days.
B008B11R1Q|5.0|I ordered this for my son-in-law off his Amazon Wish List.  He loves the album.  Would recommend it to others.
0399157565|3.0|I started reading this book dec 15 and just finished (jan 1).  When I picked the book up, I didn't know it was part of a series. i was just bored and wondering around in a bookstore. The title intrigued me and the summary and prologue made it a done deal. Patricia does an excellent job of providing background on the characters throughout the story. All of her characters seemed to have a real place and play an active involvement in solving the mystery. The life likeness of the characters, plot, and forensic science made this 463 page book a real page turner.<br /><br />Each chapter seemed to fit seamlessly with the one before it, until chapter 38. Chapter 38 and moving forward wasn't as detailed and moving as the rest; the quality didn't seem to match up. The ending of the book, along with the lack of growth in the characters is the reason why I gave it 3 stars. Kay/Benton had a lot of potential for growth, but even towards the end it appeared they had made little progress. Also, Douglas's death seemed like it was just thrown randomly in. Douglas's obsession took hold very quickly. It threw me off because the time span for the plot isn't long enough for obsession to become so overwhelming for her to ignore her basic survival instincts and years of training.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a good read. The dialogue between the characters is always amusing and interesting.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|Great to watch this with my daughters and we all enjoy the music. I think we'll be watching these over and over!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not too hard not too easy. This was one of the better games.<br />It's been awhile since G5 has come out with a good hidden object game. I wish they came out more frequently.
B000W11NOY|5.0|Excellent cd for you old school country music fans. You can't go wrong with old country music and cash is one of the best.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love this game. very challenging and fun. I recommend it to everybody of all ages. graphics are pretty cool and the game keeps you on your toes.
B0091QSNEE|5.0|My kids love Dr. Panda and all of their apps. This one is great for the kids get to cook or pretend to, lots of different foods,
B008QMMEOE|3.0|This was fun for my 3 yr old boy for a couple days, but since there are only about 2-3 puzzles you can do before having to pay for the extra ones (which we won't do :)), he got tired of it pretty quickly.  One good feature is that once you complete the puzzle, you can touch the objects to make them spin and also pop the balloons that come out at the end.  Again, fun for just a couple days.  Maybe better if you're willing to buy for your kids, but only reason I never do that is bc it's never predictable how much or how long the app will actually be engaging.
1451695195|5.0|Inspirational and very readable. As a neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander is  the perfect person to write about this subject in that he has absolute credibility and explains in layman terms without being condescending. I recommend this book to anyone who will listen.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|This is just a fun movie for the whole family. We really enjoyed watching this movie together, also at a great price.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|very funny<br />love it<br />love ted the bear<br />hope fully a second one come out to be more funny then this ted
