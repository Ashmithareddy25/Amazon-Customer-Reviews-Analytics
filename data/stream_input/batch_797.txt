B0013FXWU6|2.0|Once upon a time not too long ago, some movie people got together and decided to make a movie about an oil tycoon from the turn of the century.  \\"Let's make it really weird with some really weird string instrument music from a bad horror movie!\\" one movie making guy suggested.  \\"Yeah! Great idea! Weird! I like that.  The critics won't understand it, so they'll conclude it's bigger and deeper than it is and we'll get Oscar consideration.  Dumb people will line up around the block to see it!\\"    And there you have it.    Here it is in a nutshell: Evil guy swindles innocent people out of their land.  He drills oil.  He gets rich.  He goes crazy.  The end.    Call me simple, but I'm the type of guy who likes movies like \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"The Empire Strikes Back,\\" \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\\" and \\"Back to the Future.\\"    Why don't they make movies like that anymore?
B000A0GXGA|4.0|It's cool to see James Garner so young.  It's a pretty well-done show, and much more interesting to me than most of the shows of its era.  It's got a bit of that old 50's style cheeziness, but not too much.  It's a much more interesting take to me on the old west, a little less gunfighting and a lot more con artistry.
B00003CWN3|5.0|I watched this movie quite awhile ago on cable, and literally found it to be one of the saddest movies I've ever watched. It made me want to cry. It shows how cruel and closed minded people can be in this world, and through all this, there is definitely not a happy ending. I would say that this is a good movie, but I wouldn't like to watch it again.
B000YABIQ6|4.0|Normally, I avoid new shows on TV. After all nowadays, you begin to watch a show, really get into it, and in a few weeks it's cancelled because it's not pulling the demographic the network wants. So, I just wait to hear about the buzz surrounding a show before tuning in, usually after the first season has finished and people are still talking about it. Which is exactly how I discovered AMC's intriguing show \\"Mad Men\\", just releasing the disks and starting season two this past week.<br /><br />It's very easy to see how this show can be seen with two sets of eyes, and gleam two contrary sets of meanings from Mad Men. The first set of eyes may watch this show and think, \\"Oh, if only life was like that again\\". They may pine for the \\"good ol' days\\", where everyone smoked everywhere, women were room decorations for men to ogle, drinking at work was the norm, even if you were driving or having a child, and men ruled the universe. The men worked long hard hours, and having affairs seemed to be the norm. In other words, the good old days.<br /><br />The second set of eyes watches Mad Men and cannot help be frustrated and angry at the sexist, racist, homophobic society they are watching. Men openly tell sexist jokes that demean the secretaries in the office, and laugh loudly about it. At a party, another account exec chases a secretary, tackles her, and hikes up her skirt to show everyone her underwear. Two African-American people were fired after some money was stolen from a locker, even though one of them wasn't even in the building at the time. These eyes watch these events and think, \\"I hope we've come farther than this.\\"<br /><br />At first, watching this show, I didn't know what to make of it. Certainly I subscribe to the second pair of eyes, and wondered if this show was going to be constantly degrading populations of people. If so, that isn't entertainment. As the show gradually unfolds, I began to realize that wasn't the direction the show was going in. In fact, I couldn't honestly tell you what direction it was going in.<br /><br />When spunky and talented new secretary Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) leaves some copy with office nefario and universal jerk Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser, where did this talented actor come from?), you'd expect the usual \\"He steals the copy as tries to pawn it off as his own\\", knowing full well he would do that, and Peggy would be left with no repercussions.  Only creator and writer Matthew Weiner is much too smart for that. Instead, Pete never even gives the copy any attention at all, which is more revealing of his character and the times. Score one for Weiner.<br /><br />So the first season zigs and zags, and I found myself angered at times, surprised at times, and laughing at times. Jon Hamm plays the main character Donald Draper with such a 50's ruggedness, he could easily be plucked into any 50's film and immediately fill in. Ad whiz kid, Don carries a secret, and it's not his mistress or a Jewish department store manager that hires his firm. The secret to his identity was an interesting story, but one that ultimately wasn't too \\"big\\" when revealed. His affairs against his Grace Kelly look-a-like wife Betty played by Janaury Jones, are extremely frustrating to me. His virtuous persona jars against his philandering, and that probably makes his character ultimately more interesting. Betty herself has more problems of her own, numb hands, an unethical psychiatrist, and a new divorcee in the 'hood.<br /><br />For me, the show all comes back to Peggy. I hope beyond hope that Weiner has great plans for Peggy. Taken by itself, the first season of Mad Men could be frustrating, but knowing that women's rights began to emerge in the 60's, I'm hoping among hope that Peggy's journey will represent that eventual change. As Don recognizes her talent, she moves from the secretary pool to junior copy writer. Let's hope that more men at Sterling and Cooper recognize her talent. Both her and Don together make an amazing professional team. I can see her speaking at his retirement dinner in the 1980's, she has founded her own advertising firm and credits her early start to him.<br /><br />So, I went from some confusion, to anger, to liking the show, to really liking it. Can I say that I love the show? Not yet, thus the four star rating. I'm eagerly going to watch season two. I have to give kudos to AMC for producing this show. It's about time that interesting, provocative television series move from the limited availability that pay-per-view channels provide, into the cable that is available to anyone with a box. Tune in, sit back, and enjoy.ng at his retirement dinner in the 1980's, she has founded her own advertising firm and credits her early start to him.

B0012Q732O|2.0|\\"10,000 B.C.\\" written and directed by Roland Emmerich.<br /><br />Slightly before 10,000 BC...I guess; a small tribe resides in mountains somewhere. Old Mother, the tribe's profit, has a prophecy when the tribe finds a small blue eyed girl in the arms of a dead woman near their camp. The prophecy tells of four legged demons who will come to end their way of life which is already starting to crack as the mannicks (Woolly Mammoth) from which the tribe gets much of it's food and leather have begun to come later and later with each passing year. Most believe the prophecy but one man doesn't and he sets off to find an answer to the tribe's problem leaving his son behind. Fast forward to 10,000 BC, the four legged demons arrive and capture much of the tribe. The remaining members set off to rescue the members of the tribe with D'Leh at the head of the group motivated to rescue his woman the blue eyed girl...<br /><br />If popcorn flicks with poor plots, acting, dialogue and special effects are for you, then you have found your line of entertainment for the next 109 minutes.<br /><br />The Good: There are very few bright points in this dud of a flick. The movie doesn't lack for action and fight scenes which are up to par for the caliber of this movie. The lead girl is kind of hot in a \\"Cave woman\\" type of way, so theres that.<br /><br />The Bad: I don't know when the continental shift took place but it would appear that the creators of this movie believe it took place sometime after 10,000 BC. Our hero and his band set off from mountains that look like something you would expect to see in Europe and then traverse rather quickly into something that looks very much like a rain forest then immediately traverse into the desert. I looked at an atlas after viewing this and just can't seem to find the path our band of adventurers took to reach their final destination.<br /><br />The dialogue in this is absolutely horrid, and the plot and way the story unfolds is ludicrous. All of the action in the movie feels very inserted like the producers were sitting around going over the script and said \\"Alright, it's been 5 pages without an action beat, what can we add here?\\" I could go on and on but, a poor plot, poor dialogue, and a lack of logic make something that could have been a mediocre movie into a sub par one.<br /><br />Overall: There are so many ways to better spend 109 minutes than watching \\"10,000 BC\\".  Pass on \\"10,000 BC\\" if at all possible.erted like the producers were sitting around going over the script and said \\"Alright, it's been 5 pages without an action beat, what can we add here?\\" I could go on and on but, a poor plot, poor dialogue, and a lack of logic make something that could have been a mediocre movie into a sub par one.

B000068FY1|5.0|A belated review for an album I've had for many years, largely because I've just read all the reviews and I'm slightly surprised at some of the comparisons - particularly Gram Parsons, who I can't hear in there at all.     For me, the antecedents of this band are not so much the Byrds/Burritos,as Buffalo Springfield and their offshoots, particularly Neil Young and - the biggest soundalike of all - Poco. If someone had told me this was an unreleased Poco album recorded between \\"From The Inside\\" and \\"A Good Feelin' To Know\\" I'd have been tempted to believe them.     Anyway, it's excellent, and has stood the test of time.
B000001ESF|5.0|Rating ****** (I want to rate it 6 out of 5 stars)    I am a teenager, and I was mainly into led zeppelin, pink floyd, etc.  I was in my loft and I saw my mom's CD, \\"The Spirit of the Radio\\" which is a greatest hits of their first 12 studio albums.  I picked it up and played it and was blown away.  Sure, I had heard Tom Sawyer, but I thought that was their (rush) only good song.  The 3 songs that blew my mind the most was Fly by Night, 2112 Overture (Temples of Syrinx), and Closer to the heart.  I bought all of Rush's CD's and this album switches between Farewell to Kings and Fly by Night as my favorite Rush album.      The album starts with a 20+ minute progressive metal/rock suite.  It is a great song and is probably one of my 5 favorite songs ever.  Then there is the rest of the album.  It is really good and includes a great song Something for Nothing.  That is one of my favorite Rush songs.  The other songs on the album are good, but the beginning and ending are the best.
B000066744|4.0|I only saw this movie recently as a rental, but after seeing it I will buy it. One may find the movie inescapable as the ship that 1900 found inescapable. I know my wife and I were drawn in from the beginning. Imagine seeing a baby found on a piano while a coal stoker is searching the dance floor for something of value dropped by a passenger. The baby is given the name TD Lemon Daniel Boone 1900 based on a lemon box he was found in, his finder's name, and the year he is found. He goes by 1900. We then follow this child till adulthood on board the \\"Virginian\\" a luxury liner from the turn of the century to some time after World War II. The stoker raises the child until he is killed at his job. The ship's crew then takes on parenting until he is a man. From childhood to manhood he shows himself to be an accomplished piano player. His ability to play anything from jazz to classical is phenomenal. He gains fame aboard ship but he never steps off it. This is an excellent drama with Tim Roth and Pruitt Taylor Prince giving wonderful performances. Good quality DVD with good replayability.

B000LAZDQA|2.0|John Cameron Mitchell's first movie, Hedwig and the Angry Inch, is one of the most original, interesting, and entertaining movies I've ever seen, so I expected to like Shortbus, his second movie. It pains me to say that I don't. I wanted to, I tried hard to, but I don't. Maybe because of Hedwig my expectations were too high.    I just don't understand Shortbus at all. I never understood Hedwig either, although I saw it six or seven times live in New York and dozens of times on film and DVD, but not understanding Hedwig didn't keep me from loving it. Maybe if I'd ever really understood Hedwig I might understand and appreciate Shortbus too. I didn't, so I don't know. Paraphrasing Hedwig, I don't have much to work with.    Somewhere in the Shortbus DVD extras, Mitchell said he wanted to do with sex in Shortbus what he did with music in Hedwig. That implies that the two movies might be fundamentally similar but using different media: music in Hedwig, sex in Shortbus. Okay.    So, since I don't understand either movie, the difference for me comes down to the difference in media. The problem is that Stephen Trask's music for Hedwig was brilliant, moving, and exhilarating, but the sex in Shortbus is just boring. Mechanical, uninspired and uninspiring, tedious. Like watching robots have sex. Maybe that's how Mitchell meant it to be, maybe he's trying to make some point that I just don't get, but the bottom line for me is it just doesn't make a good movie.    I have to say, though, there is one very, very good five-minute scene in Shortbus. It's when the characters played by Paul Dawson and Lindsay Beamish are locked together in a closet during a game of Truth or Dare. That scene is sweet, moving, perfectly constructed and paced and infinitely accessible. I can watch it over and over and over and never get tired of it at all. If the whole movie had been half as good as that scene is, I'd be raving about it and wanting more than five stars to give it, but it's not.    Also onthe positive side, Jay Brannan is luminous in his few scenes (and in the DVD outtake called \\"Are you sure you don't want to **** me?\\"). Unfortunately, his best scenes in the movie are shared with the unwatchably creepy, lizard-like mayor played by Alan Mandell (and it's not because he's old).    And talk about creepy, I don't understand what anybody sees in Justin Bond. He may be a delightful person when he's at home, but listening to his whiny, grating voice drawl out that awful, interminable musical number \\"In the End,\\" which bloats out the last four hours (it seems like) of the movie, that's like water torture!    So, even though I'm seriously disappointed in Shortbus, I'm giving it two stars: one for Dawson, Beamish, and Brannan; and the other for Hedwig, who may be lurking somewhere in Shortbus and I just haven't found her yet. I intend to keep looking.
0446401307|5.0|I became a fan of the \\"Harry Bosch\\" novels by Michael Connelly late in life.  I think it was the movie, Blood Work, starring Clint Eastwood and based on one of Connelly's other books, that caused me to buy The Narrows when it came out in paperback.  I read that and found myself immediately hooked on the Bosch character.  I've since gone back and purchased the other novels in the series (thirteen in all) and have loved each one of them.  The Overlook is the newest one out in paperback and please don't confuse it with the Overlook Hotel in Stephen King's greatest horror novel, The Shining.  There's no relation between the two.<br /><br />The story begins with a murder at night on a bluff off of Mulholland Drive, overlooking (hence the title of the book) the city of Los Angeles.  The victim, Stanley Kent, was shot twice in the back of the head, and LAPD Homicide Detective Harry Bosch is called out to investigate.  Several things then happen in a relatively short period of time.  The first is that Harry's ex-lover, FBI agent Rachel Walling, shows up within a few minutes of him getting to the crime scene, and she makes it clear from the start that Kent's death is now a matter of national security and that the FBI is taking over the case.  It appears that the victim was a doctor with access to radioactive materials such as cesium, which is used for the treatment of cancer.  Kent and his wife, Alicia, had apparently been warned sometime back by Walling and her partner that they could be the focus of Middle Eastern terrorists because of the doctor's ability to get cesium at the local hospitals.  The cesium could then be used to create a radioactive bomb.  When Harry and Walling visit the Kent's home to break the news to Alicia of her husband's death, they discovered her naked and bound in the master bedroom.  It seems that two men with Middle Eastern assents entered the home and tied her up, then called Stanley and told him to steal a supply of cesium, if he didn't want them to kill her.  The victim did as required and was then murdered on the bluff.  As the FBI pursues the investigation with the belief that terrorists could be planning to set up a bomb in Los Angeles, Bosch refuses to be kept out of the loop and diverts his attention to primarily solving the murder.  It's his belief that either all count, or no one counts, and he won't allow the death of Stanley Kent to fade into the background of the bigger picture.<br /><br />The Overlook was originally published as a serial in The New York Times Sunday Magazine, and then as a hardcover and now as a paperback.  The book is shorter than the others in the series and that certainly makes for a faster pace.  In fact, I read this in just two days.  I quickly got caught up in the murder investigation, Bosch's newest partner, Ignacio \\"Iggy\\" Ferras, who seems to fight his mentor every step of the way with how he chooses to do things, the tension between Bosch and his former lover, Agent Wallings, the struggle between the LAPD and the FBI, and the question of whether or not the death of one person should be forgotten in order to stop the possible deaths of thousands.  Connelly has definitely created one of the finest characters of police procedurals during the last half of this century.  Harry Bosch is the kind of guy you want covering your back when you go through the front door of a dangerous situation.  And, if you go down the hard way, Bosch will make sure that justice is delivered one way or another, no matter what the rules are.  I have to also state that the author captures the beauty and desolation of Los Angeles in ways that stay with you long after the novel is finished.  On one side of the coin, it's a place where dreams can come true, while on the other side it's a city filled with crime and death and people who will do whatever it takes to get what they want, no matter how many individuals are hurt in the process.<br /><br />In terms of how good a novel The Overlook is, I wouldrate it in the top five of the \\"Harry Bosch\\" novels.  I definitely enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it to anyone interested in reading the series.p five of the \\"Harry Bosch\\" novels.

Dr. Bolte-Taylor takes the reader on an easily understandable story of brain function and stroke or traumatic brain injury recovery.  Her writing style is simple and easy to understand.  It's not an academic book, it's a survivor's story with lots of information about how the brain works.  It's also written with deep spiritual understanding.     I highly recommend it.

But, I used to listen to the original cast recording with Michael Crawford all the time.  I thought it was great.  Jesus Christ Superstar is by far my favorite by Andrew Lloyd Webber, but Phantom always ran a close second for me.    Knowing how badly JCS turned out when it went to film, I wasn't too thrilled to see Phantom on film, so I never saw it, I am very sorry to admit.  I had no idea what I was missing.    However, after 300, I became a fan of Gerard Butler & I sought this out in HD: it was breath-taking.  As a comparison, I listened to my old cast CD & the movie sound track blows it away in almost every respect.  Gerard Butler's voice is amazing (who would've guessed the man could sing?) & the full chorus + full orchestral sound blows the original cast CD out of the water.    In fact, I loved this so much, that I first got Phantom in HD DVD and then bought it a second time in Blu-ray after HD was pronounced dead.  I also bought the full music soundtrack from the film.    I would highly recommend this DVD in blu-ray (or even in HD DVD, may it rest in peace).
B00005IC2H|4.0|True, Agaetis Byrjun, is both fascinating and brilliant: but its also a  much more modestly scaled, fuzzily intimate record than some of the work that came after (imagine ambient electronica recorded in a cave filled with tinkling icicles). This was the 2001 break out for Sigur Ros, a band that many have since come to love for their soaring evocations of wind blasted Icelandic landscapes, their soulful melodies and imaginative song arrangements using bowed guitar, string quartet, keybord, bass and drums. All in all, it's great stuff. My favourite track is Staralfur. A song that builds to a sweeping and majestic climax. There is something broken-hearted but incredibly pure here; a melancholy that is transmuted into deeply satisfying art. For those that are interested, the song, treated somewhat diffrently, but with equal beauty and luminosity also appears on Hvarf/Heim ... a somewhat grander version, but still deeply affecting.

B0010ZR160|2.0|It's bad enough to sit through one disappointing movie after another. What's far worse is to see critics fawning all over a mediocre effort like Gone Baby Gone -- something that seems to be happening with greater frequency since Crash (unfortunately) won an Oscar for best picture. Have standards plummeted? Are critics less able to tell a good story from a bad one? Are brownie points being handed out for beating lowered expectations? That may, in part, be the case with Gone, Baby, Gone, since so many reviews express surprise that Ben Affleck (the director here) was involved and the movie isn't a complete disaster. As for it not being a complete disaster, I agree. But it's not far off. The saving grace of the film is Amy Ryan (who plays a thoroughly convincing wreck of a mother), although one good performance does not a movie make.<br /><br />When I disagree with 94% of critics (at least according to Rotten Tomatoes), an explanation is probably in order.<br /><br />First, let me try to make some sense of the story.  (Yes, this means I will be revealing parts of the story.)<br /><br />A white trash, drug-addled mother (Amy Ryan) has a strikingly beautiful daughter who she basically ignores -- so much so that her aunt and uncle become her default parents. As it turns out, the uncle may not appreciate having to babysit the kid, so when he overhears that the mother and her boyfriend may have stolen a bunch of loot from a drug dealer, he leaps into action. (The movie is murky, and later twists around a bit as to the uncle and his motivations for the events that follow. Is it greed alone? Does he want to \\"save\\" a child from a her wretched mother? One might speculate that if he wanted the best for the child, he might preserve the status quo, given that he and his wife seemingly are surrogate parents anyway, and that the aunt (at least) profoundly loves the child. At various points, the film suggests that the uncle (in addition to wanting the money) sought to have the child taken away from the mother entirely, or somehow believed that the kidnapping and ransom would make the mother realize how much she loved her child and convert her from a criminal and a drug addict into a better parent. The first is rather crazy, the latter is crazed.)<br /><br />Returning to our story, the uncle, learning of the large cache of drug money, calls an old friend on the police force (a hammy Ed Harris) and, together, they apparently concoct the following plot: they're going to kidnap the little girl and, somehow, get the drug dough via blackmail. Somehow, they think this truly awful mother (who has basically abandoned the kid) is going to give up $150,000 for the return of the child she barely knows and can't be bothered with. (This is borne out after the kidnapping, when she barely seems interested in her daughter's fate.) In the meantime, someone beats the boyfriend to death looking for the drug money. (It is very possible, given the murky storytelling, that the uncle and his cop friend may be responsible for the beating. The drug dealer himself, we are told -- we are \\"told\\" just about everything in this movie -- didn't know about the theft until after the cop and uncle found out about it, and pretty convincingly denies any knowledge of the beating. In fact, he seems surprised to hear about the theft. So, perhaps, beating to death the mother's boyfriend is part of the plan concocted by the uncle and the cop. Given the moralizing of the story, why not? It's okay to kill people vigilante-style, plant evidence, and kidnap children. But I digress.)<br /><br />Our story continues.<br /><br />Apparently, the uncle didn't count on his wife being upset about the kidnapping of a niece she obviously adores. (Try to figure that one out.) And, as a consequence, the entire kidnapping plan gets out of hand as the aunt does what any caring relative would do when a little girl goes missing: she enlists the media and just about everyone else (including our main character and his girlfriend) to find the kid. It appears that this happens even before the uncle and cop even attempt to exchange the kid for the money takes place.<br /><br />At this point, it really is worth asking whether the uncle and his cop friend ever really planned to give the kid back in exchange for money. After all, these two (we later learn -- or do we?) were most concerned about getting the kid away from the mother. Or, as later exposition (yet again) alternatively suggests, were they just trying to put the fear of god into the mother -- so they'd get the dough and turn her into a first-rate mom who would love and cherish her kid? (Give me a break.) At least these two noble idiots managed to brutally torture and then shoot her no good boyfriend, right? Maybe. Who the hell knows?<br /><br />It goes downhill from there (if that's possible), and ends up with dopey reveal that an heroic police captain (Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman) helped to stage the death of the little girl (executing a drug dealer in the process) for the purpose of kidnapping the girl and transplanting her into a better home away from her white trash mother. (Maybe the captain was involved in the plot from the beginning, but things are so jumbled that it's hard to know.) Then, our protagonist faces the deep moral dilemma of turning in the bad cops and returning the kid to her mother (and her aunt, who adores the girl), or not turning in the bad cops, becoming an accessory to kidnapping, and continuing to allow the child's heartbroken aunt to believe the little girl drowned. The protagonist's girlfriend leaves him (maybe) because of his choice (does it really matter what the choice was?), and then he gets to babysit the little girl when her mother goes on a date.<br /><br />The End.<br /><br />Let me summarize.<br /><br />I found Gone, Baby, Gone sloppy and incoherent, not tough. It was filled with silly and incomprehensible ideas and moments, and rather than raising interesting moral issues, it presented them on a silver platter in these long, disjointed chunks of dialogue that felt like lectures in a low-rent philosophy class. The scene where Ed Harris recounts his own planting of evidence was bad acting, pure and simple, and even worse writing.

0061537934|5.0|I wish I had 50 copies of this book to just hand out to people to read but I guess my one copy will have to make its rounds and hopefully touch as many of my friends as it can.  WHAT A GREAT story.  Two barks for Enzo!
B000YAA68C|4.0|\\"No Country for Old Men\\" was cheerful by comparison. Never watch \\"P.S. I Love You\\" unless you plan on feeling like you've just bottomed out.  If you're okay with that sort of feeling, if you like a good tear jerker, then you'll probably love it.<br /><br />I gave it four stars because it really was a good movie, but I wouldn't watch it again unless I was looking to come down from an insane happy-high.
0743298039|4.0|The style is strong and enticing, but that was after a slow start. After that it clinches both suspense and the heart. Setterfield knows how to yank and jerk a reader's chain. I found I had a hard time putting the book to rest midway to the end. Expect a surprise nevertheless. This is a quality read perfect for mystery lovers.
B001AEF6CW|1.0|HOW LAME     great movie but i already own it.  wow i can get a fake bowling ball which is worthless.  now,  had they released in it blue ray than i would buy this.  this is just like a remaster.  lets see how many times we can get these dummies to buy the same movie over and over again.    without blue ray being offered i would call this a sirius failure
B0017I1FP8|5.0|This incredible soundtrack to the The Dark Knight is both energetic and emotional. It conveys a dark portrait that mirrors the film. Its a grand continuation from where the Batman Begins soundtrack left off. What you expect from powerhouse composers like this is what you get! Close your eyes and you can see the whites of Batman's eyes standing in the shadows. Close your eyes again and you can hear the joker's maniacal laughter! Even if you've yet to see the movie(and what are you waiting for?) the soundtrack stands on its own as a grand ride through insanity and herosim.
B0002YLC24|5.0|But this is such a beautiful and touching movie, I had to tell others how wonderful it was. You should see \\"Before  Sunrise\\"   first because it makes, \\"Before Sunset\\" that much more meaningful. Both films are cinematic masterpieces  I believe. The reason is that both films are so \\"real\\" that you feel like you are eavedropping on this cute couple,  who could be anyone. It never feels contrived, their conversations are engrossing, never boring, honest.  Who would think a movie where people are mostly just talking could be so riveting, but believe me it is.  I think most people who watch both movies will feel, \\"Hey that reminds me of the time I was in that relationship, or the time I fell in love.\\"It really makes you think about how life is so short & true love is so special,& shouldn't be taken for granted. We have to grab it while we can.   The chemistry between Ethan Hawke & Julie Delpy is electric, so I believe that is one reason the movie is so  good and the acting is flawless. I agree with another reviewer who said' Ethan & Julie, if you're listening, please make part 3!!!  I loved the ending of this movie, but please make a sequel, don't leave us hanging. The writing & acting in  this movie are so brilliant that you can make a sequel interesting, PLEASE!!!  Most anyone would enjoy this movie, but if you're a romantic film buff, this one is NOT to be missed. If you purchase this movie  you will not be disappointed. I have seen many, many romantic movies, foreign & domestic, & this one  and \\"Before Sunrise\\" are easily two of my favorites.
B00070DK14|4.0|I originally bought this album on vinyl when it came out in the early 80's, mainly because the cover was so damn cool.  However, even then, the music didn't appeal to me all that much.  Now that I'm older, I'd still have to agree with that young man's views of \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\".  The Tull that I dig the most is missing, the flute has become mostly filler, becoming marginalized.  The overuse of synthesizers the sign of a desire to be more prog, but at the expense of that unique Tull sound so very evident from their earlier albums.  Anderson's voice is beginning to show the wear, not as deep and robust as before.  The songwriting is mediocre, but there are highlights.  For me those were 'Beastie', 'Clasp', and 'Broadsword', with a nice guitar solo from Mr. Barr on 'Seal Driver'.      The addition of the bonus tracks adds a virtual extra album, and thankfully, for the most part, these tracks are good, but again pale in comparison to their better material.    If you are a Tull fan, this is a must buy, but for any new comers I'd say go with stuff from their earlier blues phase, and just when they started going prog.  The flute, and Ian Anderson's unique style of playing, are two key components of the Tull sound, you won't hear alot of that on this album
0060872675|5.0|Though generally found in the children's picture books, this is actually an illustrated book for adult fans of the Discworld--particularly those familiar with Thud!  \\"Where's My Cow\\" starts out as the picture book Sam Vimes reads to young Sam in Thud! and Pratchett has, with his usual genius, taken it and given it the ol' Discworld flavor and turned it into a hilarious romp through Ankh-Morpork.  Grant's illustrations are wonderful, capturing some of the characters perfectly (Vetinari, in particular) and his fanciful book within a book drawings add a wonderful other-world feel.  While not recommended as a children's picture book in general, this is wonderful addition for Discworld fans.
B000P0J0AQ|4.0|One of my favorite sci-fi movies ever.  The Matrix puts the 'I' in sci-fi, in my opinion, that is.  Keanu Reeves is one awesome actor.  The thing I like the most about this movie is the adventure.  Even though they don't really go anywhere, I like how they've been through like a lot of stuff, and the music keeps the intensity and suspense in the movie, and is able to show you exactly what's going on.  I also love how smoothly they take one half of the movie and make it a scientific explanation for what's going on and all that, and the other half with action.  They are able to fit it all in and make it one awesome movie.
B00003CXDD|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since I was a kid and now my children like it.

It stays with you long after the last page is read.
0141439610|5.0|Similar to Wilkie Collins other masterpiece, The Moonstone, various characters narrate sections of The Woman in White and the story is told as the characters look back on what has already happened. This method of building a mystery is fantastic because we, as readers, also become sleuths in the mystery that takes place. Collins ability to get into characters heads enhances the level of suspense, and gives it a sense that we are right there with them.     In The Woman in White, Walter Hartright decides to take a job as a drawing instructor at the Fairlie House, where Laura Fairlie, Miriam Holcombe, and Laura's uncle reside. Once there, Walter is enchanted with the beauty of Laura, but discovers that Laura's uncle has already arraigned a marriage between Laura and Sir Percival, a diabolical man whose interests lay mainly in greed and deception. While there, Walter has a few strange incidents, one of these being an encounter with a mysterious woman in white who appears to have run away from an asylum. Walter is a little distraught after this encounter, wondering why she appeared and what she could have wanted from him. Things get more extraordinary as this random encounter seems to propel Walter into the Fairlie family secrets, and a villainous scheme by Laura's husband Sir Percival and his accomplice, the equally ruthless Count Fosco. Walter finds himself right in the middle of Sir Percival's plan, which is to not only take the Fairlie fortune but \\"rid\\" himself of various individuals one way or another. Walter, with the aid of Laura and Miriam, tries to foil this plan.     Collins has an extraordinary method of creating plot, tying all loose ends, all the while having intricate and complex narratives and twists. Moreover, he is a suburb storyteller, and although some may not like his deeply detailed methods, I feel that these give credence to character and story depth. There is a dark Gothic kind of feel to The Woman in White; it is a perfect read for a cold, rainy, thundery night. Heroes, villains, deception, twists, turns, secrets revealed, and supernatural elements: The Woman in White is a page turner despite its daunting length.
1594481938|4.0|Life affirming in a way you wouldn't expect a book about 4 down-on-their-luck characters would be.  The characters themselves are fully fleshed out by Hornby, who is a great writer with a terrific ear for dialogue.  It's all very English and hilarious in a way only the english can be.
B000W4KSVA|5.0|ballads has always been my favorite john coltrane recording. as well as his most listener friendly, a john coltrane recording to be played in mixed company without any one running out the room. and this is the original recording, so what if it's less than 40 minutes, better 40 minutes of lovely supreme jazz than fillers of several outtakes of selections. and, yes, this is the dream team, mccoy tyner on piano, jimmy garrison on bass, and elvin jones on drums.    even if you listen to nothing by john coltrane except ascension, you should have a copy of ballads, you owe it to your mom and pop when they visit to let them know you haven't musically lost your mind.    oh, and don't forget to check out karrin allyson's ballads: remembering john coltrane, featuring on 3 selections james carter on tenor.
0452289963|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but it is already changing my outlook on life.  I like how the information is presented and at times wonder how the author got into my head.  This book is elegantly and intelligently written.  I HIGHLY recommend it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I absolutely love this workout regime.  I've been doing it since April and have lost 8 pounds - without dieting like I should.  I cannot imagine what this would do if I really got serious with what I put in my mouth.  The huge positive of this approach is by the time you are about to loose it and want to give up, you basically are half way through.  It goes fast and by body feels completely different.
B000244FDW|5.0|I originally watched this version on Masterpiece Theatre in the early 1980s and am so pleased that it is now available on DVD.  Like most of the other reviewers, I have seen the 1995 A&E version, and while I can understand the appeal of 1995 version (quality of cinematography, sound, etc.), not to mention that A&E spiced it up in order to appeal to late 20th century viewers, I prefer the 1980 version.  The 1980 version is truer to the book; I get a much better sense of the relationships (Austen's novels are all about relationships) the characters, not just Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, have with one another, and there are no gratuitous scenes such as Mr. Darcy's wet shirt and the sight of one of the young Bennett sisters in her underwear, which apparently the 1995 producers thought necessary to include in order to appeal to modern viewers. Much as I am a Colin Firth fan, I actually prefer David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy.  Some of the reviewers commented that he was too wooden, not emotional enough, but that is precisely how Jane Austen wrote his character--you begin to see him show more emotion later in the series, particularly when he learns of Lydia's running off to London with Mr. Wickham.  In the book, as in the 1980 version, Mr. Darcy is a \\"proud\\" man;  proud of his money, his property, his position in society, his family, his background, his connections, and he distrusts and despises those who are not his social equals, like the Bennett girls.  I also liked the other actors in the 1980 version much better than those in the 1995 version, particularly Mrs and Mr Bennett, Jane, Lydia, Mr. Wickham, Judy Parfitt, and particularly Elizabeth.  They all portray their characters much, much closer to how Jane Austen wrote them, and you get a much better sense of their relationships.  The 1995 version is okay in its own way, but if you're looking for the truest adaption of Austen's novel, the 1980 version is it.
1416524800|5.0|Very exciting book, mostly read it because it was dan brown and I was interested to see what kind of book this was considering it wasn't related to religion like his other more famous books. Like his other books if you take it very seriously you'll probably have some problems with it, but if your simply looking for a science related thriller then this book is it.

B00004WEJZ|4.0|You know, I saw NSNA in theatres as a young teen, and having been brought up in the Moore era, I really did not see it as a bad or good movie, just an action movie.  In later years, I kept hearing this was the orphan James Bond movie, that it really wasn't very good, and that when the Bond films were being released on VHS in the early 1990's, it was not worth looking for.  I promptly forgot about the movie's existence.<br /><br />Then something happened.  Over the two successive DVD releases of Bond films over the last decade, I started remembering mysterious, hazy scenes of a chess game that caused the players to feel the pain of their decisions, with a round-faced bad guy who loved the water.  Sean Connery played the lead role.  Ooooh!  And then there was that really, sexy bad lady in (what was for 1980) a very brief bathing suit.  But what movie were these scenes from?  Oh yeah!  Never Say Never Again.  The power of negative reviews!  I decided to watch it again and yes, it did have some bizarre production values for a Bond film.  The opening music is truly awful for the scenes shown. (Irving, my Empire Strikes Back friend, what were you thinking?)<br /><br />But by the end of the movie, the good plot points outweighed the bad.  There were some moments of humor...perhaps too many for a Bond film...but I didn't feel as if I wasted 2 hours of my life.  I enjoyed it.  And while I prefer the Broccoli/Salzman productions, I think seeing an alternative like this is rewarding.  Even if you don't like it as much, it's a different take.  Mind you, after many years of being a habitual fuddy-duddy, I now now enjoy trying new things and looking at different perspectives.  You may not.<br /><br />As a true Bond fan, it's almost a must own anyways, especially at Amazon's price.  Extras?  Well, yes, that would be nice.  A commentary or two?  Redux?  Digital restoration?  Sure, but think about it...if you owned the rights to this movie, after reading about so many low ratings over the years, would you invest $5 million in a redo?  Well, I hope the owners/studio will consider it, because I think the film is worth it.invest $5 million in a redo?

B000EULJLU|5.0|Joe Baressi that is, Tool has David Bottrill produce Ænima, Salival, Lateralus and they are AMAZING! They switch (to keep things fresh...) to Joe Baressi for this album and the drums fall to the background as the guitar takes a step forward. Good decision? Decide for yourself, the tracks that actually have audible percussion are Vicarious, Jambi and some to some extent on Right in Two, hmm... best tracks on the album. Maynard does save a few of the other tracks but for god's sake bring back David Bottrill!    Awesome Album, Underpar for Tool, because of Joe Baressi.

B000053V7O|3.0|This movie has a lot going for it. Dexter Gordon, a real (and real good) jazz-musician-turned-actor stars as Dale Turner, an alcoholic saxophone player who moves to Paris and rediscovers his music and life. His world-weary voice and vibrant music talent help him to carry the role, deemed good enough to have been nominated for an Academy Award. Herbie Hancock wrote the music, obtaining a sound track that is sprinkled with Hancockian licks and solid jazz classics, apparently performed by a number of famous jazz musicians, such as Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson and Pierre Michelot. With their support and the convenience of having a number of hit tunes to use in the sound track, it's no wonder Herbie won the Academy Award for best score for this movie. It's wonderful. Where the movie disappoints, though, is in the story, which is convoluted and unconvincing. It is supposedly based on things that happened to Bud Powell and Lester Young, but because it is not a biopic of either one of those guys, it ends up being about nobody. The frenchman who befriends Dexter Gordon's character is just not believable, especially when he says things like \\"Your music changed my life\\" to a fictional guy who doesn't play an original tune in the entire movie. I can't get wrapped up in somebody's life when I don't know who they are, and while some attempt is made to sway the audience to care about these forlorn characters, ultimately, the audience is left feeling detached and empty. For a peek into the world of 1960's jazz, though, the movie is adequate, and the sound track is first rate and pretty much worth the price of admission. You won't be overwhelmingly impressed by this movie, but you won't feel like you completely wasted two hours, either.
B00122X4EY|5.0|I just happened to stumble upon this recording and was blown away the moment I listened to it.

I've recommended this recording to every blues fan I know.<br /><br />I love surprises like this!
B000MZHW40|5.0|No doubt diamonds have been smuggled out of Africa at a deadly cost.  No doubt many African nations have been torn asunder by civil war.  No doubt there have been horrendous atrocities.  And no doubt preteen boys have been literally snatched from the arms of their parents and turned into ruthless killers.  But when a movie, BLOOD DIAMOND, depicts all of the above in such a brutal, graphic nature, the question is begged:  Is it really that bad over there. . .or, perhaps, has there been a little embellishment?<br /><br />But I digress.  Whether the quest for a 'Mother Lode' diamond in war-torn Sierra Leone is slightly exaggerated in terms of its gratuitous, mind-numbing violence, the fact remains this movie is pause-everything-else-in-your-life riveting.  When a filmmaker has completely and unequivocally drawn in his viewer--makes the viewer forget about everything else other than what he/she is watching on the screen--then cinema magic has been captured in a can.  So kudos to the always-innovative Edward Zwick:  His astonishing, gasping scenes had me flinching and weaving and jumping so much the springs in my recliner are creaking.  By the time the credits were rolling I felt mentally and physically drained--and grandly entertained.<br /><br />As the lead (a former mercenary turned diamond smuggler with a heart of gold), Leonardo DiCaprio continues to surprise.  For the longest time he was an annoying scarecrow; now he's morphing into an accomplished thespian right before our eyes.  I really enjoyed his Rhodesian accent (or whatever they're calling Rhodesia these days).  And has Djimon Hounsou ever been lousy in a movie?  Absolutely not, and his portrayal of a fisherman trying to find and salvage his family is certainly no exception.  Jennifer Connelly looks good--even after a couple of nights in the jungle.  The on-screen tension between herself and Leo is fun to watch.  In fact, BLOOD DIAMOND, even if all the chaos and blood lust is a tad over the top, is fun to watch.  And if not fun, riveting works just fine.  Five 14-karat gold stars.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]fun, riveting works just fine.  Five 14-karat gold stars.  --D.

Owning the entire original series with its fantastic 3 colored boxes today, is a great feeling.   William shatner and leonard Nimoy are simply too good in this original series. I would never ever trade this with any other star trek series that followed.  A great buy, I am gonna treasure this one!

0375703764|3.0|This was a brilliant web site/piece of internet art/whatever, back at the dawn of cyberspace history. Somebody at Pantheon said, \\"Hey, let's see if it works as a Novel. If it does, maybe the Internet won't drive us out of business.\\" Well, it sort of works as a book.    Besides putting certain \\"keywords\\" in blue, underlined type, like a paper facsimile of a hyperlink, there really isn't any reason to kill trees printing this out as a book. (It weighs, like, twenty or thirty pounds.) However, since the web site is apparently gone, a book is the only way to enjoy this very, very excellent piece of intellectual brain candy.    And yes, I do mean intellectual. If you don't have at least an honorary Master's Degree in Literature, you won't get it. At all. I had to take a class just for this book. But it was worth it.
B0002ZMJ5M|4.0|Jethro Tull's style is tailor-made for a Christmas sound so this album rings a lot truer than the obligatory holiday purges issued by most of the Nashville schlockmeisters and quite a few pop stars as well.<br /><br />This was the first album of new Tull music I'd bought in 25 years. I lost track of Tull in the early 80s but this CD holds to the standard of the classic Tull works of the 1970s. I most appreciate the instrumentals and wish Tull would do entire albums of instrumentals.<br /><br />The only flaw might be that the instrumental \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" sometimes comes off like a shaving cream commercial (Old Spice perhaps?) but don't let that minor nuance put you off. This is the only Christmas CD I can think of worth keeping. Unlike the rest of the industry, this is not one of those, \\"throw a seasonal spin on the lyrics and add some triangle to the rhythm section\\" farces. Because it avoids dependence upon too many drearily predictable holiday standards it makes for good listening any time of year.<br /><br />I purchased my copy the year it debuted so I'm curious about the contents of the DVD that is now bundled with this as a set.
0061438294|5.0|To read this book is not going to make you an expert... or turn you into James Bond, but it does represent the opportunity to learn from a former Counter-Intelligence Agent, and student of human behavior that truly has few peers.  Much to my chagrin, Mr. Navarro's work has become extremely popular in MY business, and in my view has made a paradigm shift in the level of talent that I face in my work.  Yet, surprisingly, somehow I do not hold it against him. I have had approximately 10 hours of instruction from Former Special Agent Navarro at FAR greater expense than this book, and found that expenditure absolutely one of the best investments I have ever made. Find out how much YOU have been missing in dozens of situations every single day.  To make a corny Star Wars reference,(and Joe is a corny guy himself to be sure)the book is very like the first step into a larger world.  I know you will enjoy the first steps of being shown how much influence and perceptiveness you own!
159102594X|5.0|I was impressed by this first book in the series.  I enjoy books that change characters and story by chapter.  This does that.  I like most of the characters.  Glokta takes some warming up to, Logan is a hit from the get go, Jezal is ok, Bayaz is great, and Ferro I'm not liking so much.  This book is raw and gritty.  If you are looking for a grownup sword fighting fantasy this is it.  It is rather long at 500+ pages but worth the read.  I'm eager to read the rest of the series and see how this epic story plays out.
B0009A21R6|5.0|What can I say. Unbelievable. Finally heard this via a PS3 playing the SACD at 5.1 24bit/176KHz linear PCM direct via HDMI to an RX-V3800. I have owned this album since the early eighties and it was like hearing it for the first time. The clarity, bass detail and space was amazing. 5 stars just doesn't seem adequate.
B001ACY8D2|5.0|I have only known about Sigur Rös for about 3 years. When I heard some previews from their Tepoztlán concert I simply got this disc as soon as I could, and took it to a roadtrip from Seattle to Calgary. Certainly the music exceeded all my expectations. For the first time, they use mostly acoustic, live-recorded instruments, which let you enjoy not only their superior music composition skills, but also their unique and well educated voices. Gobbledigook and Ára Bátur are absolutely majestic compositions, but I must confess that my personal favorite is Festival: the power and feeling transmitted by the voices caused a different, interior experience for me.

B001B71NOI|2.0|This album has been receiving more media attention for how it was released than for its contents. The artistically ambitious but somewhat unfocused Ghosts I-IV (2008) was never an arena rock concert material, and Trent Reznor needed to do something in order to boost ticket sales of the upcoming North American tour. So, he released The Slip, a pop album filled with radio-friendly songs for free on the Internet. This album sounds very similar to With Teeth (2005), which consists of underdeveloped and boring sound and overused and recycled lyrics. I know that Reznor's lyrics have been a mixed bag, but it's a bit tough to realize it's a 42-year old man that wrote those lyrics.    However, the biggest problem I have with Reznor is that the 43-year old man (as he turned 43 shortly after the album was released) is trying so hard to be relevant among fans who are young enough to be his kids. NIN, without a major record label, now heavily depends on the Internet for marketing, and Reznor's primary target is the teenagers to twenty-something who spend hours on the Internet everyday, those youths in the middle class who think they know everything about the world through the Internet but actually know very little about the \\"real\\" world, those who are easily impressed by Year Zero (2007), which looks like a comedy compared to what have actually happened in the history (including the atrocities at the Abu Ghraib prison), those who have a short attention span, easily get bored and need to always be entertained.    It looks like most of the old-school NIN fans who grew up with the band since early 1990s have left and been replaced by those young fans. It's quite understandable because you can't stay in your 20s forever unless you are a rock star. You'll eventually get wiser and want something more intelligent and challenging, which doesn't seem to be Reznor's priority at the moment.
B000XUOLNY|5.0|The title says it all. Its a very good pop rock record on white vinyl.
B000Y179KO|1.0|There are a few highlights, but I find this album to be rather mellow and even somewhat boring.  It's often pretty, and it would be a good release for a band less than the Eagles' caliber, but I expect more of them because I know what they're capable of producing.  Saw them in concert this past weekend and the new stuff literally had me snoozing.  BUT, I greatly enjoyed hearing the bands' collective and solo members' classics.  Let's hope they have some more \\"Hotel Californias\\" in them.
B000RW3YYA|5.0|The makers of Stargate Atlantis continue to out do themselves with Season 3.  Enjoy watching the excellent character development and story lines. There's plenty of action adventure and more for the whole family.
B000088E6D|5.0|I know I'm a bit behind buying this album now when its been out for a few years, but I own the two newest albums and LOVE them.  I have to say that this album did not disappoint me one bit.  I think I like it even more than his most recent albums.  The songs are so romantic and sexy.  If you are a Michael Buble fan and don't have this one yet, do yourself a big favor and buy it!
B00005OBSD|4.0|\\"All Right Now\\" was still a couple of years away as a hit single but Free already had recorded their first classic album with \\"Tons of Sobs\\". This remaster is both flawed and fabulous--the remaster sounds pretty good overall although I prefer the sound on the original CD-- fabulous because it includes a wealth of BBC sessions as well as other unreleased tracks from a blues instrumental named after the late producer Guy Stevens (who also produced Mott the Hopple and The Clash among other acts)to \\"Visions of Hell\\" a blues romp that was replaced on the album at the last minute by the cover song \\"The Hunter\\".<br /><br />Mew does a pretty decent job with the remaster and the band rips through their originals and covers. What distinguished Free from other blues/rock bands at the time was the unique songwriting team of Andy Fraiser (ex-John Mayall)and Paul Rodgers. Also, Kosoff's unique guitar playing style and Kirke's powerhouse drumming gave the band an original sound.<br /><br />The booklet has notes about the sessions with information when each was recorded. I'm a bit torn. I like the sound better on the original CD master but this one doubles the album with 10 bonus tracks making it worthwhile for fans to pick up as well.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Among the many satisfying surprises within this elaborately produced 2008 film, the primary one is that it is at heart, a first-rate, character-driven psychological thriller that uses the familiar franchise to ask hard questions about our individual accountability at a time when anarchy and terrorism are running rampant. With this propulsive sequel, director/co-writer Christopher Nolan far surpasses the stoic murkiness that plagued most of 2005's [[ASIN:B00005JNJV Batman Begins]] because myth exposition is not necessary this time. Moreover, he doesn't forget this is also a derring-do adventure and wastes no time in establishing the tone with one of the most Machiavellian of bank robberies. The meticulously planned heist was masterminded by Batman's anarchic adversary, the Joker, a villain so wrapped up in his own psychosis of evil that he is without fear of repercussion. However, this is just the tip of a moral iceberg as Gotham City is cloaked in a crime spree by the city's major syndicates.<br /><br />On the side of justice is not only the Batman but also the city's charismatic district attorney, Harvey Dent, who symbolically plays the story's white knight. Under the guise of his billionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne, Batman is quite impressed with Dent's seemingly intractable sense of decency. So is assistant D.A. Rachel Dawes, Wayne's lifelong friend whose office romance with Dent gets serious. Of course, a romantic triangle ensues, but this is only one component of the complex storyline that has the Joker taking over the city with his merciless acts of destruction, while Batman becomes a more ambiguous figure teetering between heroic and vengeful. With his brother Jonathan as co-scenarist, Nolan provides a boldly intellectual perspective to this movie that never gives into easy answers, and the complexities are compounded by the intense feelings that fluctuate between what we expect our heroes to do and what we should expect from ourselves.<br /><br />It's a precarious line that Nolan balances with edgy conviction, and the classic good-versus-evil dynamics become upended for something that cuts much deeper. Without giving much else away, the pivotal scene with the ferries perfectly epitomizes the slippery slope all of us find ourselves in a post-9/11 world. Four of the key actors from the first film return starting with Christian Bale's covertly charged performance in the elusive title role. Not only does the character present physically demanding challenges but emotional ones as well since Batman remains a stubbornly recessive figure hiding under a familiar costume. Yet, in his innate resistance to court audience sympathy, Bale manages to cut a far more compelling character in which his internal struggles shift most uneasily to the outside. Ironically, it's his moments as Wayne that seem comparatively prosaic in conveying his outward cynicism.<br /><br />Had the film been made fifteen years earlier, I have a feeling that Gary Oldman would have been cast as the Joker. However, he submerges his natural edginess to play Lt. James Gordon as an island of decency. Michael Caine returns as Wayne's devote manservant Alfred, as does Morgan Freeman as gadgetry whiz Lucius Fox, who helps Wayne build all the technology hardware the Batman needs to stave off the bad guys. Neither is particularly challenged here, but both perform with their usual authority. There are three new faces among the principals. As Dent, Aaron Eckhardt effectively manages the film's biggest character arc, and he is really the one whose inevitable transformation most clearly illustrates the story's central themes. With a more no-nonsense manner that nicely counterbalances her standard damsel-in-distress situation, Maggie Gyllenhaal is a marked improvement over Katie Holmes' girlish turn as Dawes.<br /><br />The tabloid frenzy around the late Heath Ledger has somewhat obscured what makes his performance as the Joker so effective. With his fearsome scar-faced grin,it's a grandly idiosyncratic performance full of shrewd wit and opera-level flourish. The tortured soul that the press would lead you to believe is onscreen is not as evident to me. I see a sharply talented actor having the time of his life. Not surprisingly, all the production values are great with the architectural splendor of Chicago more obviously subbing for Gotham City this time out. Flaws are relatively minimal and actually carry over from the first film. The film is almost too oppressively dark, at least visually, and in the action sequences, Nolan still uses too many close-ups and quick edits that impinge on the clarity of the action presented. Regardless, the film is an impressive achievement, and along with Jon Favreau's [[ASIN:B00005JPS8 Iron Man]] earlier this year, may represent the pinnacle of DC and Marvel Comics on celluloid.formance full of shrewd wit and opera-level flourish.

B000002G87|5.0|This was one of the 1st CDs I bought just before I bought my 1st CD player and it remains one of my favorite CDs to this day. I have to admit, I bought it solely for \\"Layla\\", which is my all-time favorite song along with \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", \\"I Looked Away\\" and \\"Anyday\\". I read through a lot of the reviews written about this CD on here and I'm appalled that most every one of these reviews gave Clapton so much credit for ALL the songs.  There were several reviews that I read out of many that were posted on here that gave Bobby Whitlock credit for the FIVE songs that he co-wrote with Clapton, not to mention the last song, \\"Thorn Tree In The Garden\\", which is solely Bobby's song.  Not one person who has written a review on this site concerning this song knows what REAL meaning is behind it - it is NOT about a lost lover.  For all of those who wrote that they were wondering what happened to Bobby and if he's okay - Bobby and his wife CoCo have a regular gig here in Austin, TX and at each and every one of their gigs, Bobby tells his audience the story behind \\"Thorn Tree In The Garden\\" before they perform it.  If you want to know the REAL meaning and the story behind it and the other Domino songs told by Bobby himself, you'll have to come to Austin to find out because I'm not sharing! You can also see what Bobby and his wife have been up to on his MS page.  Bobby deserves just as much recognition as Eric and the rest of the \\"Dominos\\"!
B0002Y4T92|3.0|I usually try to refrain from negative reviews on musical performances but since everyone is hailing the DVD, I'll add some brief \\"shoulda's\\" that I would've like to have seen in the DVD...    A little too much footage of John Mayer but I guess the producers were hoping to snag the younger crowd.    I was also a little disappointed that despite showing Neal Schon on the side of the stage and in a brief interview segment, there is no footage of him playing!!? Would've also liked to have seen Jeff Beck who I understand was there but left out of the final edit. And I concur that there are many other guitarists more worthy than who did make the cut...Di Meola, Knopfler, David Lindley, Betts, Lukather, Coryell...    Oh well, maybe on the next DVD.
B00005JLWN|5.0|OK, we've seen this type of movie before. The oppressive future governments ruling with violence and without remorse fighting against rebels wanting to be free. Equilibrium does this style of movie so much better. How? I hear you ask. With the help of Christian Bale. My review will be in three different stages. They are the story, the characters (or character) and the review which is just my opinion on the whole thing.<br /><br />The Story: In the beginning of the 21st century, World War Three ravages the Earth and almost obliterates mankind. The few survivors realise that a fourth world war would mean the end of mankind once and for all. The world is taken over by \\"The Father\\" and his Tetragrammaton government. The father believes that the cause for WW3 was human feeling and in order to prevent that it must be eradicated. They have created \\"prozium\\" which is a medication that prevents feeling. But they must also locate and destroy every piece of art, music and other such items that would cause a human to feel. John Preston is a high ranking Grammaton Cleric and is on the front line when bringing \\"sense offenders\\" to justice. The only problem is that one day when accidentally smashing one of his prozium injections, he starts to feel. Feeling is the only thing that makes us human and Preston seeks to destroy the government that is destroying basic humanity.<br /><br />The Character: John Preston is played by Christian Bale, and I must say the character is portrayed superbly. John Preston is a man who has no emotion and is dedicated to the cause of the Grammaton. He's so dedicated that he even allowed his wife to be executed for being a \\"sense offender.\\" Preston also executed his partner and friend for being a \\"sense offender.\\" This goes to show you the ruthlessness of Preston when he believes in his cause. The interesting part of him, however, is when he goes through the transformation of being completely emotionless to feeling things for the very first time.<br />He begins to dream of his wife, he begins to seek out art and music in the pursuit of emotional stimulation. Seeing him develop and seeing Bale pull it off is what makes this film tremendous.<br /><br />The Review: When I first started watching this film I thought it would just bore the life out of me and I almost switched it off about 10 minutes in. This is simply due to it starting off as completely emotionless, sure the action's cool but without character emotion you're not getting much more than the odd gun fight. The film truly comes alive with the transformation of Christian Bales character. His acting ability really shines when he has to display a character experiencing emotions for the very first time.<br />The film is dark and at times haunting at us being reminded that such a totalitarian government could come to fruition in the near future. Until that time comes we have this film to tide us over. The action scenes are really intense and something this film holds unique to what has become quite a clich&eacute; sub genre. The supporting cast also do their job in holding their own with such a talented actor.<br />It's an enjoyable movie all round and I think everyone will enjoy it.

0399230033|5.0|My two sons (ages 5 and 4) have enjoyed this book for the last two years. While there isn't much text, the illustrations are so playful that we can't help but read the book as a three-person bedtime performance.<br /><br />I can't speak for what little girls find funny but little boys find nothing more humorous than a gorilla climbing into bed.<br /><br />There comes a point in the story when the zookeeper's wife turns off the light and tells her husband, \\"good night.\\" The next page is pitch black filled with voice balloons from the zoo animals answering \\"good night.\\" My sons love to read this part, using different animal voices.<br /><br />In summary, this bedtime book is a sketch on stage. The more you and your kids add to the performance, the more fun you'll all have with the book.

B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is a must buy for anyone who is even moderately interested in the blues, KWS, or even American musical history!  The music is outstanding, but the DVD is really what makes this special.  It is consists of interviews with the musicians where they talk about their life, and also some jamming of course!  I suggest watching the DVD while you are connected to your sound system (or good headphones)... sit back and enjoy!  I hope this wins some awards.

0780622553|2.0|At the risk of being laughed at fifty years from now, I shall openly declare that \\"Dark City\\" is a movie filled with too many science-fiction/horror cliches (a bunch of bald-headed, emaciated aliens dressed in black robes, plus a little kid alien with pointy teeth), bad casting (Jennifer Connelly, playing a sexy siren, gives about as racy a performance as a five-year-old dressing up in her mother's shoes), and a lack of any true character development.  As far as its historical comparisons with \\"Metropolis\\", well, what can I say? There have been many things in the world that were at first ridiculed, then vindicated decades afterwards. There have also been many things that were derided in the beginning and to this day are still dismissed.  While it is an intriguing idea; people's memories being erased on a daily basis and given new ones, it still is never made clear why the Aliens had a need to do this. They are a dying race, they need a new place to live; they should just invade the earth and be done with it. What difference would it make what kind of creatures human beings once were. Meanwhile they can make any material thing out of nothing from sheer force of will but they can't make an artificial light-source that would mimic the sun? They also have aqua-phobia but they plant the idea of a beach resort in everybody's memories... huh?
037582913X|5.0|My two sons (ages 5 and 4) beg me to read this book several times a week. It is one of their favorite bedtime stories.<br /><br />The first time I read this book they didn't care much for it. That's because I made several mistakes that are very important to making this book fun after repeated readings. Here's the five steps:<br /><br />1. Imitate Grover's voice. The mistake is to make Grover sound too deep. He's more like Yoda with a panic attack. Vibrate the back of your tongue like you're trying to gargle and let your voice climb when Grover is shouting.<br /><br />2. Don't forget the sound effects. There's bricks coming down, boards being hammered into place and Grover panting and screaming on every page.<br /><br />3. Let your children turn the pages while you plead to them to \\"don't turn the page!\\"<br /><br />4. Replace the words. After you read this book 5-6 times, you can spice it right back up by changing the words (e.g. \\"The Naked Gorilla at the End of this Book.\\")<br /><br />5. Use different Sesame Street characters. My sons ask for \\"The Count\\" most often as either a stand-in for Grover or as a companion through the story. \\"Three, three pages left before the end of the book, AH AH AH AH AH!\\"
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Fabulous.  John Adams brings our US history to life. It gives personality to the names of those men who attended the Continental Congress and who shaped our constitution. And it reveals the strength and wisdom of Abigail Adams. The acting is superb. The best part comes in the first episodes. I have watched the whole thing three times so far.
B00104QSOM|5.0|\\"There Will Be Blood\\" is by no means a perfect movie.  It has it's share of flaws.  But Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview is as close to a perfect performance as you will likely ever see. He becomes Daniel Plainview so completely that you often forget who you are watching on the screen, much like Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos in \\"Monster\\".<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is a \\"guy movie\\", but anyone who appreciates seeing an actor at the peak of his craft will enjoy it.
B001B71NOI|5.0|Given Reznor's horrid relationship with labels and production companies I would highly discourage anyone from paying for an album that Trent is freely giving away. Trent once had his own label and then had to disband it and even sue his business partner for impeding on his creative ownership.  With recent bashing that CD's are a redundant and outdated form of mass production and consumption.    to me its only a matter of time before someone finds a way to corrupt the current record label thats producing and distributing NIN's newest Halo to which Reznor will once again have to fight for creative ownership of his own work.    Nothing against Amazon but if Trent is giving this away as a gift to his fans for all our years of dedication, I'd say we should just take him up on that.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|I loved this series and was totally disappointed when they took it off.  I had missed several parts of the series and have really enjoyed catching up.  I am still at a loss as to why it was cancelled!
B001CD6FKI|1.0|I only saw Speed Racer for 2 reasons: (1) I grew up watching the cartoon, & (2) It was done by the Wachowski's.  Speed Racer is horrible!  The biggest pile of **** I've seen since Spider-man 3.  The 1st thing I wanted to do when I left the theatre was gouge my eyes out.  Do you have to be on drugs to see this thing?  No wonder John Goodman went into rehab after making this!  I just hope the Wachowski's next project, Ninja Assassin, is better.  Does the DVD come with eye drops?
B000PDYVVG|3.0|I listened to the book.  I think it was more entertaining that way since the author did the reading.  Book club gave it 3 out of 4 stars.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I was thrilled with the opening of this movie and have replayed it and all the Darcy scenes many times so far.  The dance scene, while seemingly more Shakespearean and mid-1600s, was enchanting and the Darcy entrance extremely intriguing.  Where this stunning actor has been all these years, I have no idea.  He could do period literature, I'm sure, but has not, to my knowledge.  And to my mind, he's a comparable talent to Daniel Day-Lewis.  His great good looks, terrific baritone, gait and superb acting are a real treat.     The direction is obviously brilliant, the proposal scene awesome (except for Keira's jaws-like mouth renouncing poor Darcy.)  With MacFadyen being more Regency England and less Hollywood, credence is added to this entrancing movie.  I fear that this dashing actor is not ambitious or we certainly would have seen more of him in American movies.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I have not read the book, so I do not know how closely it is followed, but I loved this 2 DVD series. The characters draw you into their 19th Century lives.  The absence of eligible men in the town of Cranford is the underlying cause of the story.  The most heart wrenching scenes involve misunderstandings and class distinction-which I suppose is still prevalent in Britain today.  Judi Dench is superb and I enjoyed seeing so many of the actors I have come to love from other BBC series.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I can't believe what a piece of trash this movie was. Between the  pornographic language/images and absurd storyline, how this won or got noimated for anything is beyond me. Whatever possessed such big name actors to take on this cinematic garbage is not something I can understand. Don't see it, you will surely regret it.
B00005JM1F|4.0|Some nice deleted scenes.  Everyone knows this is a great movie.  Perfect price for it and I loved the bonus materials.
1582701709|1.0|The book is a modern version of the famous Law of Attraction. This may work for some people some times, for reasons that have not been well studied in fields other than psychology, but I have yet to see a single published research to prove that it works most of the times, for most of the people. So it resembles more of a religion/sect than a \\"law of the universe\\"...     It surely attracts a lot of attention since it sells hope that many people today desperately need and seek anywhere. Sorry to disappoint you, but the truth is out there and not in this book!    There are numerous techniques to get yourself motivated and if you use this book as one, and only for that, then your money may be well spent. However, don't take it too serious so you don't have to face dissapointment if nothing happens in the end as you've dreamed of, because this will leave you in a much worse state than before reading the book!
006082543X|5.0|One of the best of Neil's work. Coraline was clearly written in a manner more approachable for yonger minds. It is dark, in much the same way Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is, and requires an ability to imagine worlds outside of our reality. Some of the reviews less enthusiastic about this book seem to be written by people who think imagination is limited to envisioning yourself winning the big game. If you hate concepts like parallel existence, the possibility that sprites, faries and elves could have or still do walk our earth, and genearlly find sci-fi and fantasy a bit confusing - avoid this book. If you are of a broader mindset - this is a must have. It is also a great book to share with anyone ten and older.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|All I can say is...wow. After being put to sleep the first time I tried to watch it, I watched it again and can now conclude that this DVD is complete and utter BS. Al Gore takes global warming to a whole new level, one that is full of inaccuracy, random correlations, and strategically placed mush for sentimental effect. How anyone could say this is an accurate, convincing portrayal of global warming boggles my mind, because all I see is plenty of junk science. Enough said.
B001BZF9UY|5.0|This is one of the few soundtracks I own, and I must say, the music is captivating. It's not just random music snippets used to make more money... it's an actual product. The score itself carries a dark mood, but also that sort of heroic theme you feel at the end of the movie (that's A Dark Knight playing the background, unless I'm mistaken). Definitely at least get Why So Serious or A Dark Knight to listen to. It's got over an hour's worth of music, too, so you get more than enough bang for your buck.
B0013LPS6Q|5.0|The remastered version of Boy is really incredible and very worthy of the purchase. The old cd versions that have represented the U2 catalog for so many years have really done a disservice to their early material. These new remastered versions really bring back the potency of the music and give the music a vibrancy it hasn't had for way too many years. So many lesser bands have remastered their entire catalog years ago. I wonder what has kept U2 from doing so? It kind of reminds me of the Beatles, where they really seem to want to control what happens to their music. Who knows?     One decision I do applaud is keeping the extra material on separate cd's (Deluxe Version). I have always felt that when bands tag on singles, rarities etc. on the back of the original LP when they re-release an album that it muddies the waters and dilutes the orginal work. I think U2 did the right thing by keeping the original work intact by offering different versions of the remastering, each with the original work intact.     Either way, I have waited a long time to see U2 finally remaster their early albums and I am very satisfied with the results. While its hard to describe, the remaster is so much more immediate, with full bass, and Bono's voice is really much more complex & three dimensional on this version. It adds so much to the music and makes one realize all over again why this album is so great. The remaster is so good(yet unobtrusive)that it has brought back memories for me from when I first listened to it back in 80-81, similar to a specific smell that jars a memory.    I believe that Boy is so good for such a variety of reasons that it has never really been as appreciated as it should be. The sheer audacity of it's sonic & thematic scope from such \\"youngsters\\" is sort of hard to comprehend. An album about coming of age that doesn't involve cars, drugs, & women but actual serious internal reflection and darker moments? The sound this album creates was (and is) so different that it creates a whole mood and \\"world\\" for its theme, providing the extra ingredient to make this something more than just a great rock n' roll album. No matter how great the Beatles were, or the Rolling Stones for example, they were always working from a known palette, reworking the colors and the arrangements into interesting & pleasing arrangemnts. On Boy, U2 seems to be doing nothing less then creating whole new sounds, evoking new landscapes for the expression of emotion and feelings as of yet unheard in \\"Rock n Roll\\". While AC/DC were singing about Dirty Deeds and even the Ramones singing about Beating on the Brat, U2 were singing about the grey edges between boyhood and manhood, the uncertainty of experience, the tension in adolescence, reflections on ego, even the simple joys of late childhood, in a unique manner that actually gave musical expression to these very same concepts.     While U2 ultimately \\"conquered\\" the music world, I would say one would be hard pressed to listen to Boy and truthfully say that from that listening they could tell that U2 would go on to sell millions of records. Boy is not really very \\"commercial\\" in any way, not like the Police or really any other band that made it big, or has since (Even newer, \\"hip\\" bands like the Arctic Monkeys have a more commercial edge to their sound). Just one more reason to see U2 as an exception....and exceptional.

B00007GZR5|5.0|I was extremely pleased with my purchase. It was listed as \\"brand new\\" and it was. I had rushed delivery in one day and that is exactly when I got it. I highly recommend the movie and the Amazon.com for all your purchases!
B0000064TT|5.0|I discovered The Dixie Dregs by accident in 1978, when I purchased a cut corner LP version of What If at the Rhino Records store in Clairemont, California, for 20 cents! I bought it cause I liked the cover...but when I heard the opening chords of \\"Take It Off The Top\\", I knew I'd found something really significant. Since then I've seen the Dregs live perhaps 20 times, and they remain my favorite guitar based instrumental band, ever.    For me, this is their defining album. Ken Scott's production was brilliant, with far more depth than \\"Freefall\\" had in terms of production (I love \\"Freefall\\" so don't take this the wrong way!). I also believe that this album was a masters class for Steve Morse in terms of production...that is to say, Ken Scott exposed Steve to a level of production he couldn't have known before this. And nowhere does that production stand out more, than on the albums closing number, perhaps the finest neo-classical piece they ever did, \\"Night Meets Light\\". That song brings goosebumps to this day.    Simply said, the Dregs were far ahead of their time, and remain so to this day. There have been no other bands that could reach this far and make it all work, in my estimation. I highly recommend this album, and every other album by the Dixie Dregs/Dregs/Steve Morse/Steve Morse Band.    p.s. Years ago, Steve Morse won the Best Overall Guitarist award from Guitar Player magazine five years in a row, and was then removed from eligibility for that award...so he went and took the Best Country Guitarist award the next year!!!
0670020745|3.0|This story is amazing, and it was interesting to read about her experiences in both halves of her brain, but she didn't spend as much time talking about the right brained \\"nirvana\\" state as I had hoped.  This book would be good for someone who had a friend or relative who recently experienced a stroke or brain injury as she details her rehab & how it felt to relearn normal daily functions.
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|This movie had potential, but turned out to be so beyond far fetched, one couldn't get past the plot. It has the Blair Witch Project type of filming. With a guy video taping aliens attacking. Okay, I can by that, but when they are after you, you're not going to keep focusing on what's going on, you're gonna run like hell! Not to mention one of the females got bitten, and was supposed to be really injured to the point of dying, but boy did she have the strength to run fast, so fake. We let our kids watch this, and they even thought it was dumb. Don't waste your time on this movie. None of the people in it were big names, only strays for a low budget movie, and it really showed. Too bad, this movie had great potential to be as big as War of the Worlds, but was lost in the poor acting, and bad plot.

B00166QJRU|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I agree with all the reviews so far. This release is geared to the hardcore Bowie fan. I commend EMI on the deluxe treatment; incredible sound quality and packaging. I know the price tag is quite hefty, but it is worth every cent! Especially for those of us who were around to experience this tour back in 1972. This is a real time piece bringing back great memories and it really shows what a great band the Spiders from Mars really were. For those who weren't around, but read about it and heard all the stories, one listen to this and you'll know what the fuss was all about.   A young David Bowie and his band just tearing it up with increrdible energy. To put it all in perspective, remember that the Ziggy Stardust album was just released. Upon listening to this show you also realize how incredible a guitar player Mick Ronson really was. Mick and David had a special chemistry and it really shows on this recording! This release is a true labor of love and no Bowie fan should be without it. Get it while you can!

0307455378|5.0|Without having red his first adult novel (and best seller) I sat with a bit of skepticism to read \\"El Juego Del Angle\\" by Carlos Ruiz Zafon.  To my surprise and delight I found a story of dark mystery, so well written, I had trouble putting down the 667 page volume I carried everywhere for a week.  I found, that Spanish cordiality and humor I so much love of the culture in every page. . . . Kudos Zafon for a great piece of fiction.
0553805460|5.0|I had heard Jordan Belfort talk on Donnie Bonaduce's radio show, and wanted to read the book right away. This guy has no shame and he'll tell you - all the drugs he's taken-  all the money he made (mostly illegally) and spent, how he treated people and how they treated him. He was on a huge high on himself. very interesting book. I really hated putting the book down.
B000KGGIZU|4.0|While Volcano is trashy fun with an emphasis on special effects, I definitely bought this double feature for The Towering Inferno. It rates alongside The Poseidon Adventure as one of the great disaster films of all time, and still holds up well today. The cast is top notch, from top billed stars including Steve McQueen and Paul Newman, to campy cameos from the likes of Fred Astaire, and names which have grown in either stature or infamy as the years have passed... O.J. Simpson, and Susan Flannery who found late stardom as the matriarch of The Bold and The Beautiful. The pre-CGI special effects are good, and while there is much fun to be had guessing which of the big stars will live or die, there's also plenty of tangible suspense in the situations and set pieces of the inferno itself. Top this off with garish Seventies decor and fashion, and Richard Chamberlain's OTT bad guy, and you have a fantastic couple of hours entertainment. This film is just begging for a remake!

B0015D3Z4O|3.0|\\"4 Minutes\\" is no doubt the strongest song in this new album.  The weakest one would be \\"Spanish Lesson\\".  I feel that many of the songs in this album are quite relaxing, in a manner that there's not much \\"climax\\".  Madonna doesn't reveal or should I say use much of her vocal strength which she already found when recording the Evita Soundtrack.  Overall, it's an easy listening kind of album.  Don't expect anything that would awe you like \\"4 Minutes\\".  It's not a very tight album, I would say.  I'm a die hard fan, and I'm being objective here.  I wish she would do another \\"Like A Prayer\\"-ish album where she really sang.

B0001L3LUE|4.0|In the normal course of events former high level bureaucrats in  American presidential administrations usually save their attempts at self-justification  for high ticket published memoirs or congenial `softball' speaking tours and conferences. In short, they prefer to preach to the choir at retail prices. Apparently, former Kennedy and Johnson Administration Cold Warrior extraordinaire Secretary of War Robert Strange McNamara felt that such efforts were not enough and hence he had to go before the cameras in order to whitewash his role in the history of his times. Despite an apparent agreement with his interviewer not to cover certain subjects and be allowed to present his story his way it is always good to catch a view of how the other side operates. It ain't pretty.    After a lifetime of relative public silence, at the age of 85, McNamara decided to give his take on events in which he was a central figure like dealing with the fact of American imperial military superiority in the post- World War II period, dealing with the Russians and the fight for American nuclear superiority during the Cold War, the illi-conceived Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, the later Cuban Missile crisis and above all his role in the escalation of the wars in Southeast Asia, primarily Vietnam.     Very little here focuses on his time at the World Bank, a not unimportant omission that would highlight my point that he might have changed his clothing in the course of his career but not his mindset. While those of us interested in learning the lessons of history have long understood that to know the political enemy is the beginning of wisdom one will not find much here that was not infinitely better covered by the late journalist David Halberstam in his classic The Best and The Brightest.     McNamara has chosen to present his story in the form of parables, or rather, little vignettes about the `lessons' to be drawn from experiences. Thus, we are asked to sit, embarrassingly,  through McNamara's Freshman course in revisionist history as he attempts to take himself from the cold-hearted Cold Warrior and legitimate `war criminal' to the teddy-bearish old man who has learned something in his life- after a lifetime of treachery.     In the end, if one took his story at face value, one could only conclude that he was just trying to serve his bosses the best way he could and if things went wrong it was their fault. Nothing new there, though. Henry Kissinger has turned that little devise into an art form. Teary-eyed at the end McNamara might be as he acknowledges his role in the mass killings of his time, but beware of a wolf in sheep's clothing. Yet, you need to watch this film if you want to understand how these guys (and gals) defend their state.

B00005JK8K|5.0|Sergeant Joe Enders (Cage) is cheating his hearing exam to get back out into the fight. What he doesn't know is that he's going to get assigned to a new duty, protecting the Code from the Japanese. On the surface, that means he's protecting a Navajo Indian soldier, a Codetalker, who speaks the one cipher the Japanese have not broken--his Native language. He's teamed up with \\"Ox\\" Anderson (Christian Slater).      He advises Ox:  \\"I wouldn't get too friendly.\\"     Enders is teamed up with Private Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), who is so new he hardly knows how to handle the food rations. He doesn't plan to get involved with his new charge, but he ends up doing so.      This is a tough film to watch. It's very real, according to the veterans I have encountered.  It's a testament to the bravery of these young Native soldiers who helped us win the War.  Very well-acted and very well worth the time.    Rebecca Kyle, July 2008

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Finally something that is worthy of repeated listens in today's unfortunate wasteland of music.

B000RJO578|5.0|London policeman (sorry, police officer) Nick Angel (Simon Pegg) is good at his job. In fact, he is so good that he is making his fellow officers look bad and gets \\"promoted\\" to a position in the country in order to remedy this situation. However, all is not as it seems in the peaceful country town of Sandford, and pretty soon Sergeant Angel, with the assistance of his partner (Nick Frost), is tracking down a serial killer who is murdering the residents of this town and making the deaths look like accidents.    \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is written and directed by Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright, who previously brought us \\"Shaun of the Dead\\", stars many of the same actors, and is even funnier than their previous movie. Essentially, \\"Hot Fuzz\\" is a parody of action movies, just as \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" was a parody of zombie films, but unlike a lot of recent parodies that have been made in the US (such as \\"Date Movie\\", \\"Not Another Teen Movie\\", the \\"Scary Movie\\" series etc), these films aren't made up of a series of recreations of scenes from other movies. Instead, these films parody the conventions and clichés of their respective genres, but in the context of an original story. If you look back at some of the earliest parodies, such as \\"The Naked Gun\\" or \\"Blazing Saddles\\", this is what the creators of these films also did, and this is the way that parody should be.
B00104QSOM|5.0|Paul Thomas Anderson's film adaptation of Upton Sinclair's novel, [[ASIN:0143112260 Oil!]] is a somber masterpiece. There Will Be Blood is a fascinating examination of mankind's descent into madness, greed and zealotry. But rather than being heavy-handed or pretentious, the film is subtle, ironic and darkly humorous. It's not often that you see an American film that so skillfully balances these themes without being tainted by political partiality. Nor has there been a film in recent years that so rightly caused controversy. And yet I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be affected by it... or to forget it.    As viewers, we are first introduced to Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) while he's working as a miner in 1898. Soon after his interests turn to oil. From the onset we can see that he is a single-minded, determined man of an unusual nature. His main concern in life isn't himself, or his workers, or even his own son. His only care is his business and even that he pursues with seeming indifference. Daniel is not an emotive individual. He's coldly ambitious and the only evidence of his feeling human emotion at all is his explosive anger. But Daniel hides his temperament from the people he scams. He uses his son as a mascot, promoting a fabricated image of a family run business. He unrelentingly pursues landowners with a confidence that borders on egomaniacal. Still, he isn't a monster... yet. When a young man named Paul Sunday (Paul Dano) claims that his family farm has oil that seeps through the ground, Daniel is at first skeptical of a man who appears so earnest. Paul intends to be paid for his information and he doesn't care if his family loses money to Plainview. This suits Daniel well (opportunism and industry went hand in hand in the early 20th century). Daniel and his son, H.W. arrive in Paul's small town where they meet the Sunday family. Their son Eli, Paul's identical twin brother, is a preacher of a fanatical Evangelist cult and he's reluctantto allow his family to sell their land to Daniel. He can see that Daniel is a successful man and that he may be able to profit from Daniel's keen sense of business. The pairing of these two men, both dangerously greedy and prideful, leads to a dramatic confrontation. Eli says that God will curse the oil well unless Daniel pays tribute to the church and allows Eli to bless the derrick. When Daniel dismisses Eli disaster strikes and H.W. suffers the consequences. Before long a stranger shows up in town declaring that he's Daniel's long lost brother. But he is not what he seems and Daniel's discovery of this brings him to the precipice of insanity and pushes him over the edge. His combined guilt for his mistakes with H.W., his all-consuming hatred of Eli and his blind ambition lead him to a horrific finale. The last scene of the film is an electrifying and unsettling culmination of one man's journey into madness.    This film isn't for everyone. I loved it but I enjoy stories told from the dark depths of the human psyche. The film isn't as violent as the title implies but it is shocking and disturbing. Paul Thomas Anderson has created a psychological epic chronicling two men's moral and mental disintegration. The style of the film reminds me of controversial director, [[ASIN:B00007CVSB D.W. Griffith's silent historical melodramas]] which explore similarly pessimistic views of life. Ultimately There Will Be Blood is a masterful exploration of two greatly flawed characters who are portrayed by immensely talented actors.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I received this DVD in the mail in mid April and have been working out to it 3-5 days a week since then (give or take, since I have been on vacation a lot and do not work out when I am on vacay). I have not really noticed much weight loss (but since I don't own a scale and muscle weighs more than fat, it's hard to go on weight alone) but I am more toned and my endurance is a lot better. Some of my clothing are really loose on me and I have received compliments on the results too. I eat whatever I want so I can't say that the workout is altogether bad. The best part is, the workout is only about 25 minutes and will get you sweating EVERYTIME! I have been on level 3 for over 2 months and have not tired of it yet. As some of the previous comments lists, the downside is that you cannot fast forward through Jillian's intro. I do like that she goes over form and tells you what to do and not do. Overall, this is a good workout video. The best part is, it only costs about $15 and you can do it right at home; a huge saving compared to a gym membership and driving to a gym (considering the cost of gas nowadays). As long as you are willing to hang in there and work hard, you will see results. Good luck!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I'm not going to go all professional-review; I'm just going to say that this show is seriously AMAZING. Not only is it captivating--certain scenes are so edge-of-your-seat I almost fell off the couch, and I'm not joking--but it's also a look inside a lifestyle most people (I hope) can only imagine. I find it spectacular that this show could actually make me feel sympathy for a murderer. Dexter is the most charming serial killer you could ever imagine; he lives inside his own little world, completely, and yet people around him love him, like his sister, his girlfriend, etc. This show totally leaves you wanting more after each episode; it's COMPLETELY addictive. Though, no doubt about it, it can be MAJORLY creepy (and it usually is) it also lets you get to know a man, who, although he may be fictional, can really teach you things about humanity. Each episode reveals a little more of Dexter Morgan's mind; and with each little bit you find out, you want to know more. This is one of those shows that leaves you feeling like you really KNOW the character; his story, the way his mind works, everything. Dexter may insist he has no feelings, but this show leaves you wondering if he just might. Though he has a disturbing love for blood, it also shows you the fact that he has BOUNDARIES. Some may consider him a vigilante, but he is no Batman. He kills only people who truly \\"deserve\\" it; he thorougly researches every kill. Some people may find themselves agreeing with him, that these people deserve to die and deserve to die the way they do, but one thing I've found with most watchers of this show is that NO ONE can deny the fact the world is better off without his victims. Dexter takes over where the legal system fails; it shows you that clearly from episode one. He gets the bad guys that slip through authority figure's fingers.  I would reccomend this show to anyone looking for something to keep them interested all the way through. But, of course, it's not for those of you whocan't stand a little shiver down your spine now and then, and certainly not for those who can't see a little convincing-but-fake blood (well, more like a lot, in some episodes). One thing is for sure...\\"Dexter\\" will allow you to judge for yourself whether he's right or wrong, for he doesn't really care what impression he makes (to viewers; with the people in his world it's different). And another thing: Dexter will soon have you questioning what really makes someone normal, or human, or HUMANE, for that matter. With each emotion Dexter experiences, you'll see new parts of him...the scarred part, the possibly almost a little bit ordinary part, and, most fascinating part of all, the part of Dexter with not only morals, but the piece of him that forms bonds with the very species who he isolates himself from, who he feels so incredibly SEPERATED from: humans.
B00007KWHP|5.0|\\"Fragile\\" is the album that would put the band on the map and turn them into arena headliners.  The single \\"Roundabout\\" would crack the top 20 and has remained a classic rock staple for the last 35 years.  With it's strange lyrics about \\"mountains coming out of the sky\\", it remains one of the more unique hit singles of the 70's.  Another lineup change was in the works for \\"Fragile\\" with original Keyboard player Tony Kaye leaving and a man who is considered one of the great rock keyboardists of all time, Rick Wakeman joining the band.  For many this is the classic lineup of Yes, and the version of the band that would produce what many fans consider their all time best material.  \\"Fragile\\" is broken up into full band songs and solo pieces by the individual musicians.  Wakeman contributes \\"Cans And Brahms\\", drummer Bill Bruford pens \\"Five Per Cent For Nothing\\", guitarist Steve Howe showcases his acoustic side on \\"Mood For A Day\\", vocalist John Anderson throws in the whimsical \\"We Have Heaven\\" and bassist Chris Squire adds his signature tune \\"The Fish\\".  \\"Mood For A Day\\" and \\"The Fish\\" have remained concert staples to this day giving both Howe and Squire their lengthy solo spots at each Yes concert.  The band compositions are all solid with \\"Roundabout\\", \\"South Side Of The Sky\\", \\"Long Distance Runaround\\", and \\"Heart Of The Sunrise\\" all considered classic Yes tracks and indeed they are all great.  In many ways \\"Fragile\\" was the album that really catapulted Yes into superstars as instrumentally and vocally they had very few peers in the business at the time.  This one is an essential Yes album in my opinion.

B00005JPY0|5.0|Just saw this one in the theater and it was awesome.  2 1/2 hours of non-stop action, it was intense!  The typical good guy vs. bad guy story line, the Joker is one bad-arse dude.  Mighty fine support actors include Michael Kane and Morgan Freeman.  The Batmobile was too cool.  It definitely makes room for a follow-on movie and at the same time, stands on its own.  In my opinion, it's a movie you would likely watch over and over again. A 24 year-old guy I know has already seen this movie 5 times in the theater because he likes the role the Joker plays so much.

B00030590I|5.0|First off, it is important to note that this version is the shorter, American version.  While some of the changes were subtle, they do take away from what I consider to be a flawless film.  For instance, the translation of Huang Di in this version is 'Our Land'.  And while that seems nice, the true translation is 'All Under Heaven'.  Just has so much more poetry to it.  If you enjoyed this film in the US, seek out the original version.<br /><br />Hero is fantastic because it is not a pure martial arts movie.  With Zhang Yimou at the helm, there was something else to be expected of this film- and it delivered.<br /><br />What Hero represents is martial arts filmmaking as an art form.  While watching the movie the thought that kept popping into my head was 'visual poetry'.  The amount of nuance and subtlety that Hero contains is hard to even begin to explain.  But the more you watch, the more you see the little details that add so much to the film, mostly on a subconcious level.<br /><br />See the colors change.  Notice when all the sound is pulled out in favor of silence, or of just the musical score. The power of a scream where there is no sound is overwhelming.  The interplay between regular and slo-motion is used, not just for visual style, but to jar ones senses or to convey an emotion that words cannot evoke. See th focus change as the direcotr leads your eye around the screen.  Notice the arrangement of people and objects in the frame.  Nothing is an accident.  Nothing is left to chance.  It is obvious that Yimou has control over even the slightest detail, a gift reserved for a handful of only the most talented like Hitchcock or Scorsese or Wong Kar-Wai.<br /><br />The fight scenes in Hero are amazing because they have a life of their own.  They weren't designed to \\"one-up\\" every other fight scene ever committed to film.  The much touted Jet v. Donnie fight is extraordinary.  Not because it is the most technically complicated or the most mind-blowing, but because it is designed for these two legends to be in perfect sync with one another.  It is flawless.  Even more so, it tells a story.<br /><br />In the fight we see the essence of these two characters.  And the fight scenes just get better from there.  The scene over the lake still gives me chills when I watch it.  That may well be the most poetic choreography I've ever seen.<br /><br />What else excited me about this film is that Tan Dun returned from doing his excellent Crouching Tiger score to do this one.  Except this time, he traded in master cellist Yo-Yo Ma for legend violinst Itzhak Perlman.  This score is more accessible than the CTHD one was.  And the music is like its own character in this film, sometimes being the only thing one hears.  It complements the picture and the story brilliantly and lends much to the viewing experience.<br /><br />I was disheartened to see negative reviews on the internet where people felt it was a film that was a propaganda piece for China and its rule.  I understand that the real Huang Di was not as beneficent as he was portrayed in this film, and that his rule was violent and short.  But what I saw wasn't propaganda for a communist/socialist government.  What I saw was the beauty of a culture that evolved over hundreds of years of bloodshed and hardship.  And regardless of the official party line, I was moved by \\"All under heaven\\".  At no point was I ready to throw a Che or Chairman Mao poster on my wall.  I don't think this is the movie that people need to worry about \\"sending the wrong message\\" to the kids.<br /><br />This film was not meant to be any type of historical record (that's why we have history books and why movies aren't valid sources to cite in research papers).  What this movie represents is filmmaking at its greatest height.  The film as a true art form, combining on-screen and off-screen talent with visuals and audio that can stand alone, yet when combined, equal more than the sum of their parts.  Asian film fans, martial arts fans, the average Joe, and film snobs alike should be able to appreciate this on many, many different levels.should be able to appreciate this on many, many different levels.
0810993139|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid<br />By Jeff Kinney<br /><br />Yes, this is a very funny book.  Greg is the middle child and in middle school.  He is also in the middle of everything.  If there is a problem at home or at school, you can bet he has been there. What does it take to be popular with girls?  It seems like the rules have changed.  Even his dorky friend Rowley is more popular than Greg, and he's not even trying.<br /><br />When Greg tries to be the class cartoonist, it backfires and all of his cartoons are edited by the teacher. When Rowley becomes the class cartoonist, he has taken the ideas that he worked on with Greg, and won't even give Greg any credit. When Greg decides to be the class clown, he knows he can pull it off on the day when they have a substitute.  Wouldn't you know it; the substitute is none other than Greg's mom! Who turns out to be the class clown?  Rowley, of course.<br /><br />On the day he substitutes for Rowley on the safety patrol, he chases the kindergarteners with worms. Can Greg help it if Rowley gets kicked off the safety patrol, just because Greg was wearing Rowley's coat, and the neighbors thought it was Rowley who tormented the kindergarteners?<br /><br />As the mother of a boy, I enjoyed the Diary of a Wimpy Kid. This book brings back memories of those awkward years of middle school.  This book looks like a diary, with simple drawings on every page.  It is easy to read. Middle school boys will want to read and laugh along with Greg's antics.<br /><br />Jill Ammon Vanderwood<br />author: [[ASIN:142591098X Through the Rug]]<br />[[ASIN:0979845548 Through The Rug: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)]]

I'm telling everyone I know about this cd.
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|Superb photography but I am not sure about the history. It was the wind not the fire-ships which destroyed the Armada and where are the famed quotes about not making windows into men;s souls and her best lines before the Armada at Tilbury? I do not think this was at all an anti-catholic film. As far as England is concerned, Catholic Spain and its supporters were the enemy. A good tonic for a patriotic Englishman.
B000YAA68W|4.0|Persian culture boasts a glorious history that stretches back three thousand years, but the last thirty years have not been kind. This award-winning animated film is partly a historical review of the political revolution that overthrew the secular-minded Shah in 1978-1979, the eight-year war with neighboring Iraq that followed about a year later and slaughtered a million people (1980-1988), and the religious extremism that filled the power vacuum along the way. In particular, the film follows the plight of a precocious and independent-minded little girl named Marjane and her extended family, and how all this upheaval impacted them. At this level Persepolis is a powerful story about personal identity, cultural consciousness, difficult choices, and historical fate. The film was written and directed by Marjane Satrapi and Vincent Paronnaud, and based on the two best-selling graphic novels by Satrapi. In French with English subtitles.
0743454537|4.0|I picked up this book, and knew immediately I wanted to read it. Quickly breezing through the novel I was reading for three weeks, I finished and started My Sister's Keeper. I read it in two days.  The way it is written was particularly appealing to me, besides the intense subject matter. Every chapter is told in the first person of several different main characters of the story. Besides that, the font for every character is different..... this visual is a refreshing and really awesome way of bringing a character off the pages and into your memory....   so, anna is thirteen and files a lawsuit against her parents for medical empancipation. she had been a donor for her sister, kate, since birth, because kate has a rare form of lukemia, and anna was genetically modified to be a match for her sister.... the book follows this basic plot line, until the end, where it turns and twists and apparently, leaves some readers with a bitter taste in their mouths.  not mine.  the ending was perfect. it was shocking, and amazing. it balanced the dichotomy of terminal illness with the fragility of mortality in a way you may not first expect...for the sake of not spoiling it, I will stop there.... i highly recommend this book. its an easy, interesting read. perfect for any season....
B000UJ48VI|4.0|I think Nabokov's Lolita is one of the greatest novels of all time, and Kubrick's film version does the book ample justice. James Mason is sublime as Humbert Humbert - an intellectual old world European emigre who finds himself in 1950s America on a professorship. His patrician aloofness rubs against the provincial Charlotte Hayes - a homely woman struggling with a recalcitrant daughter Lolita. The poor woman has no idea the depths of the obsession within Humbert's mind - all swirling high culture and depraved Eros. She gives him space in her house to write, and falls in love with him. Humbert is after something much darker - her brattish, nymphette daughter Lolita, but marries Mrs Hayes in order to maintain contact with the family.<br /><br />The Nabokov style is encapsulated in the film: 'And when called upon to enjoy my promotion from lodger to lover, did I experience only bitterness and distaste? No. Mr. Humbert confesses to a certain titillation of his vanity, to some faint tenderness, even to a pattern of remorse, daintily running along the steel of his conspiratorial dagger.'<br /><br />The movie, necessarily can't be as dark as the novel given the subject matter. Lolita is more high school prom queen than true pre-teen. Clare Quilty features as a chameleon rival, played with comic mastery by Peter Sellars. It is a different type of comedy than the novel - more laconic and at times slapstic (the cot in the bedroom scene) than truly dark chocolate subversive. But a Kubrick triumph in any case. And the notoriously hard to please Nabokov thought so too.
6305949980|5.0|Only Tim Burton could produce a holiday musical about Halloween's grotesqueries taking over Christmas.<br /><br />And in fact he did. Burton wrote and produced a charming stop-motion musical called \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" which is as close as we'll ever get to a Burton Christmas film. And there's rarely a dull moment in this town called Halloween -- from start to finish, it's a quirky, macabre, vintage-flavoured ride through the darker side of everybody's favorite holidays.<br /><br />In Halloween Town, the undead Jack Skellington is king, and each Halloween the residents try to make their celebration even more horrible than the year before.<br /><br />But this year, something is missing for Jack, and he starts wondering if scaring people is all his life has. He ends up wandering into a sort of holiday junction, and finds a portal to Christmas Town -- it's full of snow, lights, presents and innocent fun. Jack is instantly enamoured of Christmas, and decides that for this year, the residents of Halloween Town are going to celebrate Christmas.<br /><br />He manages to convince the other Halloween residents -- except the sweet rag-doll Sally -- to go along with his plan. So Halloween Town is redecorated and filled with presents (in a suitably ghastly style) and \\"Sandy Claws\\" is abducted so Jack can take his place. But are the people of Halloween Town just not suited to innocent merriment, and can the Pumpkin King fill the capacious red suit when Christmas Eve rolls around?<br /><br />The idea of Halloween ghouls and spooks deciding to take over Christmas sounds terribly twee in concept, like a gimmicky children's book. Fortunately Tim Burton's darkly humorous sense of humor and delightfully gothic designs -- as well as Henry Selick's brilliant direction -- end up turning the movie into something that is more than just another kid's movie. Think a Burtonesque \\"Princess Bride.\\"<br /><br />Much of its charm comes from the richness of Burton's visuals -- his Halloween Town is saturated in spiky iron fences, ghost dogs, insects, mad scientists, and a spooky cloudy night that never ends. And though the inhabitants of Halloween Town are devoted to being grotesque and spooky, there's a lighthearted benevolence in their actions at all times. It almost makes Christmas Town look... dull.<br /><br />But it's also an incredibly funny, sweet little movie, with plenty of heart. There's an adorable little love story between Jack and Sally (\\"My dearest friend, if you don't mind...\\"), despite Jack's total cluelessness. And Burton weaves in lots of solid musical numbers (\\"There's children throwing snowballs/instead of throwing heads/they're busy building toys/and absolutely no one's dead!\\").<br /><br />But the crown jewel is Burton's macabre sense of humor. Hardly a scene goes by without a creepy gag (one child's present is a shrunken head) or clever dialogue (\\"Jack, please, I'm only an elected official here. I can't make decisions by myself!\\"). But the best humor comes from the Halloween-town's residents eagerly trying to be festive, and only making Christmas even creepier than Halloween ever could be.<br /><br />For a skeleton puppet, Jack Skellington is a pretty adorable hero -- he's earnest, generous, but suffers from a bit of ennui from the same old performance every year. His meditative songs about Halloween and his attempts at Christmas add an introspective note to him as well. And he's backed by a bunch of lovable characters, with Sally and the ghost dog Zero at the forefront.<br /><br />\\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" is a macabre, wildly adorable little movie that reminds us why we love Halloween (besides the candy).

B0011NVC98|4.0|Beowulf is certainly a landmark in animation movies. The animators have succeeded in a near perfect resemblance to not only the way the leading actors look but talk and act also. Now that was something. Another landmark aspect was the use of motion capture which is not new and a similar technique was used in The Polar Express but Beowulf takes it one step further. Some of the incredible action scenes are almost impossible to create without computer animation. The colors used in Beowulf were good too. Apart from the technology here is an animation movie for adults. This is certainly not a 3D movie for kids as there is violence, blood and gore in good measure. There is some nudity too. Somewhere after the half of the movie the plot gives away after Beowulf's meets with the monster's mother, Angelina Jolie who is animated to sheer brilliance, and you get a feeling that the story is almost over and by the time more action is seen our hero has turned an old man.    The soft acoustic songs the queen sings are lovely and I wish I could get longer versions of the same.     Four stars.
B00139W3NE|3.0|I didn't want to be confused by learning what this movie was about by first reading other people's reviews. This movie is a combination of The Wizard of Oz; Narnia, the Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe; Invaders From Mars, and perhaps bits and pieces of others.     The Magisterium is a group that wants to kidnap kiddies (and presumably everyone and anyone else), so as to make them have unquestioned obedience and become one of THEM. Our heroine Lyra is perhaps the only one who can keep the Magesteriun from conquering the world. She is given a Golden Compass, but she can use it only if she is THE CHOSEN ONE. (Where have we heard that before?)    Speaking of the golden compass itself, it seems the further the movie goes along everybody-- the good guys, the bad guys, and everybody else in between-- loses interest and gets apathetic about the golden compass. Toward the end everybody knows she has the golden compass. A number of the evil adults could've just manhandled our heroine Lyra and grabbed it from her, but they treat it like it is just a mildly amusing topic of conversation-- such as, \\"Did you ride your bike today?\\" or, \\"Did you hug your dolly today?\\"     There are a bunch of witches flying about, and one of them-- a beautiful woman whose name escapes me-- occasionally lands and talks with Lyra. But nobody seems to know if these witches are from the East or from the West. At one point Dorthy-- er, I mean Lyra-- asks the big ol' bear if they are good witches or bad witches, and even the big ol' bear says he doesn't know.     Then we come to Nicole Kidman. I wish she could've dressed a little more sexy-- like a strapless & backless cocktail dress, with maybe slits up each side, but she dresses more conservatively than I would've liked.  I read reviews in the paper where it was said that Nicole Kidman was largely absent in the movie, but I think she shows up about as much and as often as any of the other adults.     At one point in the movie we get a fight to thefinish between two big ol' bears for the right to be called Papa Bear of the North. There is a nice scene or two that leads up to it, such as when our just kidnapped Lyra finds herself presented to the bad ol' bear, and she engages in a verbal duel with it about how she would be more valuable to him alive than dead. It's the sort of thing James Bond would do if he were to suddenly find himself prisoner in front of his arch enemy. Okay, so the two bears have their fight, and the good one wins; and the bear army stands up on its hind legs, lift their heads up, and they all go, \\"Yaoooooooo...!\\" And then everybody seems to forget about the bear army.     One thing I really liked about the movie is the fantastic photography, and I don't just mean the special effects. Just the little scenes where people are alone in an office are masterpieces of photography. This movie was one of those rare gems where it was done a little better than it had to be in a number of places. Movies like that are always a pleasant surprise for me.     Except I didn't like the battle scene at the end of the movie, which takes place at midnight in the snow. I think it is unethical for a movie to skimp on the budget by making the battle scenes take place in the middle of the night.     All in all it wasn't such a bad movie, and the movie is a fun movie to write a review about. But, in the sequel we really need Nicole Kidman to dress a little more sexy. It may be out of character and incomprehensible for Nicole to be dressed up as if she's ready for cocktails, or as if she's ready for her next photo shoot, but the movie is already incomprehensible, and some of us bigger boys could use a little something extra to occupy our minds as we sit through The Golden Compass, II.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|I found this one hard to resist!  I'm a dyed-in-the-wool action/adventure/war movie buff.  I've rented and watched this movie twice already, time to buy! I couldn't help but be sucked in!  What a fun movie!
B00133KFGW|4.0|I have to admit, I stayed away from AUGUST RUSH due to the commercials and the negative reviews that appeared in my local newspapers and on some local television shows. It looked like it would be a bit too syrupy and critics warned it was too far fetched. I decided to save the money and wait for the DVD. After seeing the DVD, I'm sorry I waited so long to see this film. It's enchanting and heart warming and an all around feel good flick.<br /><br />The story focuses on Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore), a young boy growing up in a New York home for children. His conception is the result of a romantic evening involving a classically trained musician  Lyla Novacek (Keri Russell) and Louis Connolly, an Irish born member of  Celtic musical group (Jonathan Rhys Myers). Due to tragic and cruel circumstances, the young Evan is placed up for adoption but never seems to find a family. After being bullied at the home, Evan sets out to find his parents, believing that the music will guide him and the most of the film revolves around his journey.<br /><br />Critics are correct in stating that the story is far fetched, and there are quite a few gaps and questions that remain unanswered, but this is the case with many movies, and we still love them, the reason being the actors make the film convincing and we tend to ignore the flaws. The reason AUGUST RUSH works is due to the wonderful performances of the actors, particularly the young Freddie Highmore. His performance is so appealing, we hope for the bets for the young man, knowing all the while that the film will have a happy ending. We also feel for Keri Russell's Lyla and Rhys Meyer's Louis Connolly is an all around good guy as well. Robin Williams' character \\"Wizard\\" is a bit creepy and a bit too one dimensional, to Williams' credit he does do his bets to bring the character to life. Another notable performer in the film is Leon Thomas III who plays Arthur, a gifted child performer living on the street who rescues the young Evan while unknowingly placing him in danger.<br /><br />In many ways, AUGUST RUSH has a number of similarities to OLIVER TWIST (the novel more so than the musical film OLIVER!), Evan being similar to the innocent Oliver Twist, Wizard being similar to Fagin ,an d Arthur, a street child similar to The Artful Dodger, and some of the challenges the young Evan faces are Dickensian-like. Yet just as readers root for Oliver and want the best for him, the same holds true for the young Evan.

B00005JPNZ|4.0|This latest chapter in the Indiana Jones saga has been a hard movie for me to review. I loved the movie, but it wasn't perfect. A lot of the problems others have hated about it, never bothered me. I want to write it a glorious review because it's Indy, I had fun, and this character means a lot to me. 1984's \\"Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom\\" was my introduction to the character and his world, and it was a childhood shaping experience for me. Saw it in the theater 10 times. It means a lot, and so did this movie. Indy's return. There are little creaks here and there, but I enjoyed the heck out of most of it. I've already written two other reviews for it elsewhere, but took a long time to do this one. Why?. For it to settle in and to really get my thoughts, since those other reviews I wrote seemed to be based in childhood nostalgia for me and could of been better. Again, this has been a tough movie for me to review.    First and foremost, Indiana Jones is back after a 19 year absence from our silver screens. There is no doubt that it is a most welcome return, nor is there any doubt that Indy is still Indy, or that Harrison Ford can still deliver the goods. Plot-wise, it doesn't hold up as much. Indy tries to find a crystal skull before those pesky russians(headlined by Cate Blanchett, who is both good and channeling femme fatale Natasha from \\"Rocky And Bullwinkle\\")do, and so on and so on. It's really nothing new and, quite frankly, gets kinda confusing and bizarre as it goes along. Story and plot is not KOTCS's strongest suit. Along for the adventure is Marlon Brando wannabe Mutt(Shia LaBeauf), as well as Indy's former love, Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen).    KOTCS is both steeped in warm nostalgia and a new world. It's Indy, looks like Indy, feels like Indy, but there is something different. Coming almost two decades later, that's to be expected. Director Steven Spielberg is still a master at directing summer popcorn fare, and he knows how to do a tight action scene(key being the motorcycle chase thru campus)like nobody else. Effects wise, there are some startling moments and some very CGI moments, but the CGI never distracted me from the movie like it did others. In fact, I thought it all looked really good. After a while, you do long for the good old days of the earlier Indy films, but it still worked for me. And Spielberg, well, there is still plenty of Spielberg magic left in the guy, and some of that is on display here.    Harison Ford is 65. So what?. He doesn't look much older or different than he did 10 years ago, and he is in incredible shape. He's a man's man, and a man's hero, and he is more than up to snuff to put the fedora back on. He and the character are a bit older, but nothing much else has changed. He still hates snakes(in one of the film's funniest and most endearing moments), and he still has that spark. LaBeauf is not the 'Jar Jar Binks' of the movie. He is quite charming, actually, and more than holds his own. It was also great to see Karen Allen back, but I felt she was relegated to just 'one of the gang', and wasn't given all that she could of been given. Still, she did a fine job, and she looks incredible. Not much difference with her either.    In the end, KOTCS is a fun movie. It's an entertaining movie. It's an Indiana Jones movie. Some of it is silly, some of it is exciting, and all of it is fun to watch from beginning to end. The story of the film is shaky, and as the film goes along, it gets even more wobbly. The climax to the plot is somewhat head scratching, and I am still torn by it. But the very, very end of the movie, the last scene, is fantastic. All in all, it was a nearly 20 year reunion in the making and, for the most part, it was most welcomed. Like any reunion with someone in some place you haven't been in decades, there are some awkward moments, but it's still a good experience and you are glad you went.
B0018O4YT0|5.0|The need for a director's cut of a motion picture varies from cashing in on the unenlightened consumer to the actual artistic integrity inherent in such an undertaking (and everything in between, I suppose). However, regarding this particular movie, I feel compelled to share the following tiny bit of information and opinion.     On my initial viewing of this flick I actually missed the first minute or so. Little did I know at the time that this greatly added to my enjoyment of it. My subsequent viewing on DVD contained an introductory narrative spoiler that I discovered (by the director on the commentary track) was insisted upon by the studio. This immensely reduced the \\"twilight zone\\" suspense and eeriness of the work. What a ridiculously bad judgement call - a perfect case of not only underestimating but insulting the intelligence of the potential audience.     To actually deprive the viewer of a better entertainment experience has never really made any sense. Watching the mystery unfold gradually is much more enjoyable. I am almost positive and certainly hope that this unfortunate aspect of the original release has been remedied.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Yes, my title may be obvious and a tad cliche, but it speaks the truth. While I hold season 1 amongst the highest of the three, the third season of Supernatural shows that this wonderful and brilliant show just keeps getting better and better. The third seasons of some of my favorite shows(Buffy, Angel, Gilmore)are my favorites. There's something about those threes. Supernatural is no different as this year provides what we have come to know and love about this great series. Mystery, thrills, chills, emotional pain, humor, action, classic rock, and an amazing family dynamic with brotherly camaraderie. Season thee also seems to up the blood quotient as well.    The main deal with season three largely looms on the shoulders of older brother, Dean Winchester(Jensen Ackles, who deserves an Emmy more and more)who, after his deal with the crossroads demon last season, only has a year to live. Thus, the season three story arc has the brothers desperatley trying to find a way out of this deal for Dean, while doing what they do best along the highways and byways of America.    The season opens with \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", a strong but not mesmerizing episode. Things only get better with the second episode, \\"The Kids Are Alright\\", which is a classic, kick butt episode of SN. A favorite of mine for the season. Things get mired in Grimm Fairy Tale mode with the great \\"Bedtime Stories\\", where our brothers encounter moments taken right out of the...well, bedtime stories we all know. Also tops on the list is the instant classic \\"A Very Supernatural Christmas\\", which is destined to be a yearly ritual now for SN fans. \\"Jus In Bello\\" is a brilliant little jail house under siege classic, and the hilarious \\"Ghostfacers\\" is a wonderful and hilarious experiment. The finale, \\"No Rest For The Wicked\\", may just be the best finale, and cliffhanger, the series has had. An ending that would make any fan want to hurry and fast forward thru summer for. Folks, there is more good here, but it's best you go and find these gems on your own. Not a bad one in the bunch. Well, \\"Red Sky At Morning\\" leaves something to be desired.    Season three was cut down from the usual 22 episodes to just 16 because of the writer's strike, but oh what 16 episodes. Who knows what other goodies we could of encountered had we had the rest of the season. One sore spot was the introduction of Bela and Ruby to the fold. Bela, while beautiful and charming with her accent, didn't seem to add anything to the show. Ruby(Katie Cassidy), actually seemed to have a place and a part to play, so she wasn't so bad. Otherwise, season three was another perfect example of why this show gets the attention(maybe not from it's own network) and acclaim it does. It's fresh, clever, inventive, deep, layered, scary, funny, you name it. Season three shows a show whose own self identity, as well as it's actors, writers, and directors, just keeps getting better season by season. Year 4 can't come soon enough.
0156034026|3.0|First of all, I liked the style of this book, and the references to Lahore and New York, and the way the narrator tells the story in some sort of 'you'-perspective. Also it was interesting to hear of the changes in attitude in New York after 9/11 (I also sort of recognised it, in that when I was with my family on Miami Airport for two hours before we went on to some tiny island, my grandfather -who has a moustache and a skin colour that make him look a bit middle eastern- was controlled a lot more at the security point then the rest of us).   But half way, the story becomes rather confusing. I mean, I could sort of follow the fact that Changez smiled at 9/11 (because I can imagine that to anyone from a coutnry that's feeling rather powerless, it would not -at elast not only- be the deaths of many many people, but simply an attack to the most powerful country in the world, and I can imagine that there are quite some people that resent very powerful countries -especially if they also have big armies and nuclear weapons- and thus, sort of enjoy it when that country gets attacked by something, especially if it's something it can't blast a way in a few days) and although I was very much against it, could also stil get the way he treated Erica.  But what I did not understand, was that when he felt so lost, he did not either quit his job just right away, nor just quit whining and did his job. I mean, I do not understand why he has to dupe his company so much, and why he betrays everyone like that, or even why he returns. Also, he jumped to a lot of conclusions rather fast, without explaining how he got to those, and that made me realise that although he (the narrator) had told me a lot about his life, I nevertheless did not know or understand him at all, and what I did get to know of him, I did not like (even though in the beginning, I had been inclined to like him because of the beautiful English). I think the book would have been better if the author had actually given us a main character with a personality, instead of this boring, rather bleak character who just follows along his own voice and whatever the author had in mind at the moment.  Also, I feel like the author started this book with a plan of what he wanted to tell people, then as he went on to write the story, started to like it and went a wholly different way, and then half-way realised he was getting away from his goal, and thus suddenly made a lot of forced changes happen.  Lastly, I did not understand the ending at all (and at least to me it certainly wasn't 'painfully clear' as the back of the book stated): who is really hunting who? Is the American, who is obviously having a gun, someone who has been sent to capture Chavez, or is it that Chavez and the waiter and so are after the American? Or is it something entirely else? I have no clue to this at all, and I find that very unsatisfying, because when I read a book I'd like to a, understand it when I'm finished and b, for it to have ended by the time I've reached the end.  In short, a beautifully written, but confusing and unsatisfying book.
0375703764|2.0|When this book was published back in 2000, I remember reading the reviews and hullabaloo and being very intrigued, but just not intrigued enough to actually read the book itself. Last month, my book group picked it for our monthly discussion, providing the needed kick in the pants for me to finally check it out. After wading through all 700 or so pages of primary text, footnotes, pictures, appendices, etc., the one sure thing I can say about the book is that more than anything I've read in recent years, it will reflect whatever's going on the reader's mind. And as a result, it's inevitable that there's going to be a huge range of reaction to it.<br /><br />Decent summaries of the book's plot and multilayered structure exist in plenty of venues, so all I'll say is that it's a work of experimental (ie. non-traditional) fiction whose narrative is delivered in several overlapping and interrelated streams (including typographical devices -- some nifty, some not). To that end, anyone interested in experimental approaches to fiction should definitely check it out -- although I'm pretty sure that none of the techniques and devices Danielewski employs is new. And while many reviewers situate it in the Borges/Pynchon realm of tricksy writing, I ultimately felt the book never extended beyond a messy postmodern update of H.P. Lovecraft.<br /><br />The catalyst for the book is a house with supernatural properties, and its subsequent exploration by its owner and others. That particular thread is a nice take on a classic gothic theme, and is presented through a variety of forms to lend it the air of reality (somewhat akin to faux documentaries like The Blair Witch Project). Both the mystery of the house, and the psychology and relationships of the explorers are very engaging. However, that storyline is presented by a narrator, whose own descent into madness plays out in various footnotes, and this isn't pulled off nearly as well. There are bits and pieces here and there that are nicely done, but on the whole, it never transcends the cliche of a naive investigator getting sucked into the dark abyss of a cursed/forbidden/deadly text.<br /><br />The construction is all very nifty (although the various embedded codes prove to be less than the sum of their parts), and the satire of academia is cute (although served in overly large portions), and the weaving in of classical mythology is nice, but it ultimately the jumble of elements feel more forced and affected than organic. Of course, that's a matter of interpretation, and I have no doubt that other readers will feel as if the book is speaking directly to them. I felt (as did the other members of my book group) that the book is a disappointment because its grand theme appears to be limited to Matrix-type inquires of the \\"what is real and what is illusion?\\" nature. And while this may spark some readers into deep inquires into their own existence, we found it rather banal. However, as I noted above, that may be a mere reflection of our own jaded 30-40something selves, and readers in other circumstances might well derive more meaningful moments from it.ut on the whole, it never transcends the cliche of a naive investigator getting sucked into the dark abyss of a cursed/forbidden/deadly text.

B000R9RGF6|5.0|Exceptional. At first, I was unsure of this album, as I had not ever heard of the artist before. However, the music is incredible and can be described, on some tracks as haunting. I had the distinct pleasure of listening to it while on a long-distance train ride, and it made all the difference. I STRONGLY suggest it.
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Having worked and lived in five countries and seen about 4000 movies (at least) in three languages, I can confirm that Matilda shows what America is still made of, the dreams can come true! point.  If you ever doubt of trying for your dream, that movie will show you that with courage, hard work, faith and not giving up that you can do it!
B00006EXDM|5.0|what can I say?  This is exactly what it is supposed to be.  It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected, what more could I ask?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|More films should be produced like this one about the founding fathers of this great country.  Too many Americans, especially young ones, do not have an understanding and appreciation for United States history, and that is so sad.  As far as I can tell the film is historically accurate in the main.  Very enjoyable!!
B000TSIK14|5.0|Ahhh, another amazing, and yes sublime, work of art from Scorpions. Awesome visceral, driving guitars, lucid rhythm and of course divinely inspired vocals...<br />Buy it and a copy for anyone you know needing dark-and-light inspiration. Humanity: Hour 1 delivers timeless hard rock that is nevertheless immediately relevant to today's younguns.  Also note the \\"message\\" of the album, akin to German-born Eckhart Tolle's spiritual teachings. Tolle, like Scorpions, says, \\"Humanity: evolve or die!\\"
B0012GMVDK|5.0|For those of you who are concerned about the drift of America over the last several decades, this album is the soundtrack of our country's descent. When Cohen sings, \\"I have seen the future. It is murder,\\" he is talking about the arc through which we are falling. The poet says what the rest of us somehow sense but can't quite verbalize. Imagine Cohen in 1930s Germany. Except he is talking about us here in America, now, where we are and where we are going. \\"I have seen the future. It is murder.\\" The rest of the album is pretty good too. \\"Charlie Manson, the white man dancing.\\" All the way to the White House.
B000YABIQ6|3.0|I recently watched all of the first season due to all the Emmy hype that is out. I was very disappointed and a little confused on why this is considered \\"great\\".  Don't get me wrong, it was interesting enough for me to watch all the episodes and tune in for the very disappointing Season 2 opener, but it was nothing outstanding to me.  I loved some dramas that were out like Dexter, The Tudors, etc. and thought the acting in them were Emmy material, but not Mad Men.  It's boring, slow, dull, but still for some reaons a little intriguing.  I guess what I really don't like is that you really never get to know the personality of certain characters.  Betty, for instance, is prim & proper one moment, and letting strange men in the house the next minute, and then out shooting neighbors pigeons the next.  I think a lot of the hype deals with the fact that it's set in a time period a lot of people (especially white males) would like to go back to.  Personally, it's kind of scary in my opinion.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|What I loved:<br /><br />Penelope's sweetness and her every girl struggles, whether her looks or her mom or the very volatile combination.<br />The supporting characters were entertaining, most of them, anyway.<br />Quirky and attractive sets and wardrobe.<br />The fairy tale aspects.<br />The overall cleanliness of language and low crudeness level. There were only two comments that were suggestive and both were more double-entendre than outright crude.<br />Clever writing and storytelling.<br />Max's soulful eyes.<br />Mean people got theirs.<br /><br />What I didn't love<br /><br />The emphasis on drinking -- I was amazed at how many scenes had a character either talking about drinking or actually doing it.<br />Penelope's friends weren't really developed as friends.<br />The key relationship for Penelope was either not fleshed out enough or was resolved too quickly.<br />Her parents stayed in fairy tale la-la-land but Penelope grew up.<br /><br />I will buy this film because I loved more than I didn't, and my kids are older. You might want to preview if drinking is a hot button for you. I think Penelope is supposed to be a fairy tale designed with a message for girls, but then it also tried to appeal strongly to adults. I'm not sure it's the healthiest mix.
B0019FOC5E|3.0|When I saw the stage musical I bought the Special Edition Original Cast recording. That CD had 27 tracks. This one has 17. The overture/entrance for both act 1 & 2 was dropped from the movie. The 3 finale/encore songs was in the movie but not on this CD. In addition Chiquita and I Do was not on the CD. Our Last Summer replaced Thank You For The Music in the movie. Thank You For The Music was used during the credits in the film and is the bonus song. If you wait 15-20 seconds after the last song I Have A Dream this will magically appear. So patience grasshopper and leave your CD player alone.    What I missed most from this CD was the spoken parts within the songs was missing. Especially when Sophie was asking her prospective dads questions during Gimmie and the dads realizing why they were there and offering to walk her down the aisle during Voulez-Vous. The presence of select lines in the musical play CD make me relive the play again; the lack of them makes this CD feel like just another version of ABBA.    With one exception the singing of the cast was at least adequate. Better than the singing in the Original Cast recording.   Meryl Streep was a standout. As effective as Celine Dion during The Winner Takes It All. Yet during  Slipping Through My Fingers was very soft as she reminisce about her daughter. Very nice changing her singing style to match the mood of the song.  With one exception Amanda Seyfried also did a good job.  Julie Walters & Christine Baransky are rather brassy but does a good job.  One of the problems I had with the musical Original Cast recording was the similar almost monotonous sound. The different styles on this CD makes things much more interesting.  Now the problem songs.  During Our Last Summer Pierce Brosnan only has 2 lines and was not bad enough to ruin the song. The rest of the time he was singing chorus where Coiln Firth shines. Unfortunately while the song was a soft reminiscing pierce Amanda Seyfried sang full out and broke the mood.  SOS needed saving from Bond, James Bond. Pierce sang the 1st stanza. Not particularly good but I can grin and bear it. Until Meryl Streep sang the 2nd part. It was night and day. Ouch!  Knowing Me Knowing You was replaced by the (easier to sing?) When All Is Said And And Done. The producers should have just cut both and let it be. I hate fumbling for the Next Song Button.
0061537934|5.0|Last night was a beautiful evening, and I sat on our screened-in porch and read the last few chapters of The Art of Racing in the Rain. Our two golden retrievers, Cody and Buddy, were both happily napping beside me. This book was wonderful, and after reading the last page I cried for almost an hour. Both of my dogs woke up and tried to comfort me.  They nuzzled me and pawed me until I ended up on the floor beside them and cuddled with them.  Oh how we take for granted how much our canine buddies understand us! I'm recommending this book to all of my family and friends!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|What can you say...?    Has retro made a comeback...sure there are comparisons to Amy Winehouse.  But Duffy is the goods and this release is a SMASH.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this movie. If you want an inspiring and classic love story, this is for you.
B00005JPS8|5.0|The tittle says it all. It was just a great action movie without 250 million dollar special effects. I have never seen a Robert Downey Jr. movie, in fact I never really heard of him but he is just awesome in this movie. Terrance Howard was great ad Jim Rhodes (War Machine). Now Im not riding on Marvel or  anything, I just hate it when people have stupid reasons to hate this movie. Some idiot actually said that this movie is racist towards black people. Now how stupid is that?
B0017YWG2S|5.0|This record is mainly about the singing of Elis Regina and the songwriting of Antonio Carlos \\"Tom\\" Jobim. Elis Regina is a wonderful singer. She has a beautiful voice, a nice sense of style and can handle a variety of material from slow ballads to fast jazzy numbers. Tom Jobim is a songwriting genius and a fine guitar and piano player. The combination of the two makes for a great record. I might have preferred sparser, less pop-oriented arrangements, but the combination of Elis and Tom transcends the background for their performances.
B00004RFFW|4.0|Do you like lots of violence, steamy scenes, and going beyond police duties to get even with the bad guys? Then this movie is for you. The white South Africans are the bad guys. They dodge anti-apartheid protests, pay for drug deals with Krugerrands, hide behind their diplomatic immunities to avoid police action, and then bump off the police investigators one by one. One investigator's wife is murdered. Another investigator dies when jumping off a diving board that blows up. Still another must remain seated on a toilet bowl to which a bomb has been wired. Finally, the South African bad guys intend to escape on a ship that is about to leave port. So the drama continues...
B00007H1Y2|3.0|I have several Ry Cooder records. I like all of them, some more than others, and this is not one of my favorites. As usual for a Ry Cooder record, the musicianship is great but the concept doesn't work too well for me. There is less variety on this record than some of Cooder's other records. The music is very stylized and I find that a whole record of this music is a bit much. This record is mostly instrumental (the limited vocals are in Spanish) and I think that contributes to the sameness of the music. It is pleasant background music, but a little dull.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Quite simply, Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends blew my mind.  Coldplay's 1st 3 albums are good, but none of them stuck out to me.  There were good songs, great for the iPod generation.  But for those of us that remember the concept of an album, Viva la Vida is a breath of fresh air.    The musical experimentaion of the album is really the high point of Viva la Vida.  Every song is somehow interwoven into a larger concept that simultaneously draws from the great rock and roll albums of the past as well as presenting an entirely new sound.    The two singles from the album, Viva la Vida & Violet Hill, can stand solidly on their own.  But through the support of the other 8 songs on the album, they are brought to a higher plane.  Life in Technicolor and Cemeteries of London are intriguing starts and set the tone for the album.  Lost! and 42 continue to build the album's intensity and its contemplations of life, death and life thereafter.  The latter half of 42 begins to tie the album together musically; this short stretch was very surprising to me and very much unexpected.  Lovers in Japan and Yes continue to build on the albums themes and add some intriguing musical experimentations ahead of the album headliners, Viva la Vida & Violet Hill.  Strawberry Swing is a fun, laid back song to set up the final climax of Death & All His Friends.    Musically, this is one of the best albums that I have heard in over a decade.  Coldplay went a long way to expand their abilities and found a new fan in me.  Viva la Vida may very well go down as one of the best albums of the decade, right up there with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, U2's The Joshua Tree, and Nirvana's Nevermind.
0439882826|5.0|I purchased this book for my nephew who just turned 7. He had recently seen his first Star Wars movie and seemed to enjoy it. When he opened this book, he was excited, but no where near as excited as when he turned the first page and saw what it contained. He was mesmerized, not only by the pop ups, but by the pictures and the stories behind each item. This is the ultimate Star Wars bible. If you love Star Wars, you have to have this item. The item I thought he would like the best were the light up sabers, and he did. The most amazing part was that the battery power to the sabers could be turned off so that you didn't waste it!!!! How thoughtful. Too bad there aren't more books of this caliber on other subjects.
0790731479|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies (and, now that I've purchased it, one of my kids' favorites, too!). This movie is so hilariously cheesy it's irresistable. The soundtrack is great, and the kids always jump up to dance along with the characters at the dinner scene. While some of the lines border on awful, the actors are (usually) believable... and who wouldn't mind watching a young Alec Baldwin (remember? back when he was a hottie?). This movie is a classic and a great addition to any movie library (if for nothing else than historical value).
B000VECAC6|5.0|A scathing social satire by the most accomplished satirists of the age, Monty Python, born in the '60s but particularly relevant after the invasion of Iraq. Those who are squeamish about religious satire should probably avoid this movie, but for anyone worried by the rise of Christian Fascism in America, you couldn't find a better vehicle for dissent than this insightful and roaringly funny movie. \\"Brian\\" is born next to and at the same time as Christ, and his life experience, as he attempts to make sense of Roman oppression and the Jewish resistance, parallels those of Jesus. Drawn into the Jewish rebellion, Brian experiences the ambiguities of all third world peoples resisting colonial rule.
0393327655|5.0|This is such an imperative book to read for any human being wishing good for the future of our species.  A must for any intelligent person.
B000F5GNX8|3.0|Well casted, well acted, well filmed, and almost well written - Kiss Kiss Bang Bang intrigued me and turned out to be what I expected it to be: a quaint, slightly offbeat dark detective comedy.  Nicely set up and compelling in the beginning - Downey and Kilmer make an unlikely but highly watchable duo.  Downey is spot on as ever, but it's Kilmer who shines.  Past the a-list, it's interesting to see Kilmer in different roles now.  The plot however, turned out to be more complicated than Robert Towne's Chinatown and several other mysteries combined, and that turns out to be the film's undoing.  We end up keeping up with it because of Downey's predicament, but ultimately this isn't quite an action, comedy or thriller but more of a headscratcher instead.  Worth watching mainly if you're either a Downey or Kilmer fan - or really desperate to watch Corbin Bernsen!
B0017XFBMG|5.0|One of the best collections I've ever experienced. Outtakes, demos, rare recordings, live recordings, all remastered for brilliant audio quality. Phil Chevron's notes are extensive and fascinating. The Pogues at their best, and an amazing listen from beginning to end.<br /><br />A must-have and now one of the treasures of my collection.
0061537934|4.0|What a great book. My wife got it from the library and couldn't put it down and like most others went from laughing to crying while reading it. After getting thru the painful first chapter (it brought back powerful memories of my lab passing away a few years ago) I very quickly grew to love the story and the characters. Beautifully written from a dog's standpoint and it will definitely make you look at your dog(s) differently and wonder how much they really know and what they are thinking. I've often thought my german shepherd dog, and 2 golden retrievers, are more human than dog and perhaps this book explains why.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the part the book that dealt with the malice his in-laws had towards him and the steps they took to get his daughter Zoe from him really bothered my wife and I. It seemed overly harsh and cruel in a book that otherwise dealt with hardships and obstacles in a thoughtful and realistic way. The book shows what a fine person Denny is and how in overcoming those incredible obstacles he showed what a true champion he really is. (Edited to remove spoiler and possible misinterpretations).<br /><br />Definitely a great read and we highly recommend it. Since reading the book, we are spending even more quality time w/ our beloved canines now, perhaps realizing even more so how short and precious our time w/ them really is.<br /><br />Definitely 2 barks.<br /><br />Update: the more I think about it, the more I think this book deserves 5 stars, it is an incredible book, one of the best I've read.
159562015X|3.0|With the book Strengthsfinder 2.0 you get access to an online self-assessment the result of which is a list of your five personal strengths. All the possible strengths are described in the book (online you also get a printable PDF of the same descriptions). Though I thought the results of the test were interesting and accurate, I was disappointed by the reference pages that told about each strength. They didn't offer me much insight, it felt a bit generic. What was there seemed valid, but only scratched the surface and offered little direction to further personal development.
B0000542D2|2.0|The other night I decided to pull out HDN and watch it for the first time in several years. I have both the MPI and Miramax DVDs so I reached for my good old MPI edition and popped it in. The 1.33:1 aspect ratio always bugged me a bit but I thought \\"so what\\" and decided to watch it because I love the opening \\"I'll Cry Instead\\" prologue on that version. When the movie got to the \\"And I Love Her\\" sequence I started, for the first time, to notice that the mix was different than the video tape I'd seen years ago. Paul's vocal, which should be single-voiced on the main verses, was double tracked throughout. During the song, the director's assistant positions George's amp on an amp stand. When George tries to lean against it, it falls and in the original soundtrack you can HEAR the amp fall backward and George stumble. When I saw that the sound to that moment was missing I realized MPI had used the released mix of the song and simply stuck it in the soundtrack. Always one to HATE it when studios tamper with a work of art, especially one as important and influential as this one, I removed the MPI version and but in the Miramax. When the same sequence appeared again I could hear that the mix was correct and the stumble was there in the background, but it seemed that heads were chopped off and scenes looked different than they should due to the 16:9 \\"enhancement.\\" It was at this point I decided to try and figure out just how much of the picture each release had sacrificed since there seems to be no end to the conjecture on this subject on the internet. I place both DVD's in my computer, captured an identical scene on each and then compared them in Photoshop. Now I have heard over and over that the original film was shown in a ratio of 1.66:1. When I compared 1.66:1 to a ratio of 1.77:1 (roughly what 16:9, the Miramax version, translates to when changed to units of 1) I saw that if the original film was in 1.66:1 only a tiny bit of the picture should be cropped (about 3 to 5percent) at the top and bottom of the Miramax DVD. What I found was that Miramax had chopped off about 20 percent at the top and bottom. 20 PERCENT!. That's a lot of the image folks! MPI had hacked off about 10 to 15 percent from the sides so they didn't do much better. When I tried to see what aspect ratio the two pictures together formed, I kept coming up with a ratio of around 3:2 or around 1.5:1 not 1.66:1. The original aspect HAS to be around this size. So ultimately what you end up with is this: One of the most musically influential and historically important films ever made with around 20 percent of the image missing. And since MPI chops off almost as much of the sides and mutilates the soundtrack, owning it isn't much better. I would love to see, just once, someone release a work of art such as this without doing the viewers a \\"favor\\" such as hacking at the image so it will fit a 16:9 television or recording over a soundtrack because they feel no one will notice. While I will give Miramax a couple of points for making the color balance and contrast look great, that was the only thing they seem to get right (see the other complaints about how they somehow turned a mono soundtrack into 5.1 surround by messing with the music tracks and how weird it now sounds). Perhaps one day this magnificent film will be released in the correct ratio, with the correct soundtrack, and in the correct color balance. But I'm not gonna hold my breath. After all, the people producing these new releases seem to know so much more than us fans who actually spend money on them. If you love the movie as much as me, all I could suggest is rent the old VHS video tape from MPI and watch it. You'll get more of the picture and the soundtrack will be right. It won't be crystal clear like a DVD, but at least your memories will remain intact without someone else getting involved.
0897500482|3.0|Complicated but good for a dedicated martial artist looking to learn the ways of Jeet Kune Do. I bought this book looking for a less complex look into Bruce Lee's style.

0515141429|3.0|A body is found in the antiseptic Georgia town so police do the only thing logical -- arrest the man just off the bus in a rainstorm, there to find out about the blind black blues singer from 60 years ago.    There's the state prison, the rich young ruler, the Harvard-educated policeman, a couple of elderly barbers, and the new guy, who, incidentally, is a West-Point graduate recently of the MP's.  And a woman cop.    Things unpeel onion-wise with questions about how the tiny town on the way to nowhere looks like a movie set, how the first and second men were killed, why an apparent suicide-by-hanging was let go at that, why the young guy had been going to work as usual, eighteen months after he'd been fired from his day job.    Break-neck action, slam-bang conclusion, and the only ending reasonably possible.    Right there with your Sam Spades and Lew Archer.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I quite enjoyed this movie and i think the casting was great. I like the different twist (focus) of this movie vs. all the stories told before. The acting, costumes and feel of the movie were also really great. I would for sure recommend it to anyone who likes any of the three main actors/actresses and/or the story of Ann Boleyn.
1400034779|5.0|This gently humorous book and its five similarly funny companions offer more than an engaging story line.  You learn that Botswana is a true success story, one of the few in post-colonial sub-Saharan Africa.  You can also learn something about the culture, social behavior, languages, and personal values of the people.  Of course you need only go to Wikipedia or to Google \\"Botswana\\" to gain access to a wealth of facts, if facts will suffice.  But, if you wish to be touched by the fabric of Botswana life the six books of the No.1 Ladies Detective Agency series, will let it happen and provide much to ponder.
0061537934|5.0|I have always thought about writing a review of some of the great books I have read, but never did.  I had to after reading this book.  I started this book on a Thursday night and finished it on Sunday afternoon.  That included being on an adult weekend at a cabin so didn't have a ton of time to read.  But when I did, I found this book and READ!      This was an amazing book.  As some other reviews said, I'm not necessarily a dog lover (although we have a new puppy) and I'm not into car racing.  I couldn't put this book down.  I loved the dog (Enzo), I loved the main character (Denny), and I loved the story.    I enjoyed how the art of racing was a metaphor for the art of life.  It was meaningful and full of emotion.  This was a funny book at times, a heart breaking story at times, and a great page turner.    What a talented writer Garth is.  I look forward to reading his other books.      Some of the other books I've enjoyed are \\"I Know This Much Is True\\", \\"Eddie's Bastard\\", \\"The Kite Runner\\", \\"America America\\", \\"The Story of Edgar Sawtelle.\\"  Just to name a few.
0060899220|5.0|I loved this book.  I am a fan of his show so the words in this book came out sounding a lot like Anthony's voice.  Great stories, great restaurant insight.  I thought I wanted my son to go to culinary school and be a chef, but now I think I have changed my mind!  This book is totally entertaining, especially if you are a foodie.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|While Season 2 was not very good in my opnion, season 3 of Lost has regained mometum and it is actually even better than the first season. While as usual the flashbacks are unnerving at times and do not really contribute much to the storyline, after a while one gets used to them. It is interesting to see how the lives of the people were connected even before the crash . As usual the season will end in a quite unexpected cliffhanger with some new questions raised. We see life with the Others and while we do not really get to know who they are, there are some interesting touches here. The real hero of the series is Hurley really.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Finally! This classic western rates up there with any monumental film of the genre.  Duvall and Jones are at the top of their game and the rest of the cast is stellar.  This film gets dark at times and it will catch you off guard with devastating plot twists and heartfelt portrayals.  I can't believe someone with a brain put this on blu-ray! I never thought I'd even see it in anamorphic widescreen, so this is a major bonus. Enjoy-it's long, but a great ride!

I have a new found respect for the turntablists in the game.  Beastie Boys have impressed me much more after taking the time to listen to the layers behind their clever lyrics and listen to the scratching being done by mix master Mike.
B000000W5N|5.0|For my money, the Stones never put out a better album than 1971's \\"Sticky Fingers\\".  I know, I know, 1968's \\"Beggar's Banquet\\" and 1972's \\"Exile On Main Street\\" have their devotees, but \\"Sticky Fingers\\" is the World's Greatest Rock And Roll Band at its absolute zenith in the studio.  Though he never really fit into the group's aesthetic, the young Mick Taylor was, technically, the best guitarist the band ever had, and helped return them to their blues base after Brian Jones died. And, in my opinion, Jimmy Miller was the best producer to ever work with them. The record kicks off with the filthy \\"Brown Sugar,\\" the group's best Seventies single, and continues from strength to strength.  \\"Moonlight Mile\\" is ravaged and lovely, as is \\"Wild Horses,\\"  the best ballad Jagger and Richards ever wrote.  The Stones were at their nastiest on \\"Bitch\\" and \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking.\\" Everything released from 1968 to 1972 is essential, but \\"Fingers\\" is, quite simply, the best rock band on earth at its height.

386521584X|5.0|We're lucky to have this edition. Robert Frank is an old man with health issues now. That he is healthy enough to oversee this work is wonderful. Everything about this edition - especially in comparison to the 2007 Delpine edition I purchased earlier this year - is first-rate. I wish I had known this was coming out!     The book is a little smaller than the Delpine, but that's the only real negative (if it is one) I can think of. The main thing to me is that the photos themselves are how Frank intended them to look. Gone are the overly-lightened faces that plague the Delpine book. This is a pet peeve of mine that kills many photos in this Photoshop age. This is very obvious in the New Orleans trolley photo. In the Delpine work, the faces of the white passengers are totally washed out, and the black faces are awkwardly lightened (someone apparently thought they were helping Frank's work). That's all corrected here. In this Steidl edition things are shown as they were intended. One can even see details in the face of the man at far left, even though it is partially obscured by a window reflection.     Also, on several photos more of the frame is visible. This was most noticeable to me in the Butte, Montana photo of the woman looking out the car window, with several children in the back seat. A good portion of the left side of the photo is now visible, along with more shown on the top and bottom. The new crop just seems more \\"right.\\" Not too mention that the face of the child in the middle of the photo is too light in the older edition.    Simply put, comparing the two editions is an eye opener. I first saw these photos years ago in a much earlier edition (I believe it was the 1969 Aperture work) and I still marvel at the depth of the images in that printing. I don't have that edition in hand, so I can't do a direct comparison, but I believe the Steidl images are much closer to that ideal. Franks prefers his images a little on the flat, low-key side. Another differenceis that the photos are now printed on a non-glossy paper. I was surprised at this at first, but now I believe it works much better for this book.     In short, if you want an accurate, lovingly-printed edition of The Americans at a reasonable price, this is the one. Highly recommended.
B000002U82|5.0|No matter how many times I hear this album, I continue to be amazed. Anyone that says this album is overrated needs to have their head checked.  Amazing.
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Bought this album a few weeks ago after hearing Re: Tracks online, and it is by far one of the most beautiful albums I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.  I can listen to this cd over and over, no matter what kind of mood I'm in.  There is an ebb and flow to the track progression that gently kind of pulls you along with the emotions in each.  Justin's lyrics are bizaare and heartbreakingly intense in the best way imaginable.  He melts words into chords and vice versa.  The more you listen, the more you become totally immersed in the \\"excavation\\" he ultimately achieved in writing these tracks.  My first go at the album in it's entirety led me to a deep place within myself that I hadn't visited in a long time, but as I listen more and more, I'm finding a light in the songs that allows me to shift into a whole new gear with it. I can only hope that he continues to produce songs with the same raw approach and I look forward to everything and anything that he gets his hands on in the future.  On that note, if you like Bon Iver, check out his cover of The Rosebud's \\"Get up, get out\\".  Amazing.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|Just when we have resigned to the renewed realization that every infectious pop melody has been used and reused to the point of utter absurdity, there is always that one band that sprouts from nowhere, spices up the rehashed formulas and proves us wrong. In 2008, this band is unquestionably Vampire Weekend. You may know the  Webster's general definition of the word \\"infectious\\", but I assure you, upon first hearing the ridiculous swing and bounce of \\"Oxford Comma\\", the term will suddenly become very specific and incompatible with any other nouns, proper or not. This basic concept applies to the entire album. Exaggeration? Of course, but this little lie tells a truth. Once you hear Vampire Weekend, you will not be able to sit down. Ever wonder what a Baroque string quartet, bred with a good dosage of Reggae and sugary Pop's child would sound like? Listen to \\"M79\\". You can almost hear a variation of Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" (harpsichord included!) throughout the entire thing, even when the steel drums start to gently sway your hammock suspended by palm trees over salty sand and shell, bathed in a fiery sunset. There is a reason that Vampire Weekend is showing up in the play lists of radio-heads (as referring to radio-addicted drones, not the band) and music elitists alike. Sure they may not be ultra-complex or even that original, but this album is more fun than anything that I've heard in a rather lengthy period of time. Vampire Weekend is witty without sacrificing conviction, exciting while at the same time pondering, catchy and absolutely intelligent, similar and simultaneously diverse. I suggest you pick up this simple, stunningly upbeat and rabidly addicting, toothy-grin-inducing virus.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|The HIMYM gang [again guided by director Pam Fryman] returns with 20 more legendary episodes in How I Met Your Mother - Season Three. When [[ASIN:B000TM1CKQ Season 2]] of How I Met Your Mother ended, Marshall and Lily had finally hooked back up (and tied the knot), but Ted and Robin had suddenly split up. The situations were reversed when [[ASIN:B000HT3P7E Season 1]] ended. Season Three picks up sometime later after Season Two with Robin introducing her new Argentinean lover, Gael (Enrique Iglesias) to the gang and Ted hooking up with a wild tattooed woman (Mandy Moore) after going out to party with Barney. The end result from that encounter later leads Ted (in \\"Ten Sessions\\") to a chance meeting with Stella (Sarah Chalke, fresh from NBC's recently ended [[ASIN:B0014DZ2U0 Scrubs]]), a dermatologist and possible \\"mother\\" candidate who he falls for in the season's most engaging story arc. Props must be given to the series creators for the attention to continuity featured each season as past acquaintances (Trudy from Season One's \\"The Pineapple Incident\\" returns with a tempting opportunity for Ted in \\"Third Wheel\\") and plot devices (\\"The Goat\\" from Season One's \\"Milk\\" and Season Two's \\"Slap Bet\\" in \\"Slapsgiving\\") are revisited this season with hilarious results.

B0000X61UU|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this video!  It is the perfect full body workout.  I had the VHS version of Cindy Crawford's first video and got on to re-order the DVD when I saw this video.  I decided to go for something new and different and I'm so glad I did.  I just advanced from using 3 lb weights to 5 lb weights and wwhhheeww what a challenge.  I've only used the video for a couple weeks now and I already feel so much more fit and toned.  I'm excited to keep going for more results.  I'm going to order her 3rd video and alternate days to keep things changed up.  Cindy Crawford may get negative reviews from some, but I'll tell you what, I'm a huge fan.  She's real and down to earth and not the typical annoying workout instructor.  This video is challenging, but after just a short time you'll find yourself stronger and able to do it with more ease.  I highly recommend it anyone ready to get toned and in shape.
B00142X56Y|5.0|There is a clever juxtaposition of avant garde staging/theatrical setting with period subject material.  The Queen of the Night is downright hot, not to mention the 3 maids.  Pappageno stole the ovation!  Although a small part, Pappagena is delightful.  Regrettably, I don't know what to say about Tamino and Pamina but I'm sure they were great.<br /><br />The singing is superbly articulate and the acting is second to none.  Not just standing there singing with cheap backdrops!  The orchestra is strong and the chorus powerful.  The sets are meticulously done, eye catching but not distracting.  The fire and water sequence is very creative.  Its quite a production.  Be sure to watch the ovations after it ends.  The accolades are appropriately given to those who deserve them the most.  Try it and you'll love it.
0671646788|3.0|Do you ever feel that constant growth is sustainable?  That by the constant struggle for more, shinier, bigger things, that people are just exercising greed?  Well some words of caution with this book.  In one point I even read something along the lines of 'refuse to look back at bad events'.  Sounds like a river in Egypt to me (think about it).     I do agree with some of the authors words, about making excuses for yourself not following through, but to me, it read like the words of someone who is finding more efficient ways to knock his way through a jungle without knowing where he's going.

006113399X|5.0|\\"The Redbreast\\" is, quite simply, the best thriller I've read this year.  I first read \\"The Devil's Star\\" by Mr. Nesbo and was very impressed with his writing and his protagonist, Detective Harry Hole.  Harry is sort of the Norwegian equivalent of Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch.      A portion of this story takes place during World War II and details the fighting that took place along the Norwegian border with Russia.  The Norwegians supported the Nazi's in their efforts to stop the Russian advance into their homeland.  Several of the men that fought on the front lines during the early 1940's play an integral role in the modern day tale of Hole's attempt to stave off an assisination attempt on current Norwegian royalty.    Harry Hole, a world weary investigator, is shuffled off to a lesser investigative branch of the government after he accidently almost kills a Secret Service Agent who he thought was trying to kill a visting President Clinton in the late 1990's.  He becomes embroiled in an investigation into white supremacists, meets a fellow woman agent that he falls for, and delves into the past to uncover the secrets of several men who fought in the war.    The book is long but doesn't feel like it and the pace picks up considerably during the last two hundred pages.  I would defy anyone to put this novel down while charging through to the end of a story that has one of the most incredible, twisting endings that I have read in years.  The plotting of this book was masterful.  I was very sorry when this one ended.  I'm also sad that it took so long to get this and other novels from the same region translated into English so they can be enjoyed on this side of the Atlantic.  Nesbo, Mankell, Erickson, et al. are all great writers and have so much to offer to the genre.  Publishers take note:  Get them translated and bring them to American readers who may be looking for something different.
B00030590I|4.0|Not going to ruin the ending for people, but even with the sad ending, this is one of the best movies with Jet Li. It reminds me a lot of Niccolò Machiavelli's The Prince. From the philosophy of how to become a good king and betrayals thereof. Everything about this movie is pure aesthetic, and art for arts sake. The backdrop is so illuminating and dreamlike. How in one moment, the scenery is very green, then very red, that it gets really fun to guess what the next color will be. Overall, an awesome movie you don't want to miss.
B001AW9DKK|5.0|I don't want to be insulting, but if you dis this CD for purely political (not musical) reasons, you're being idiotic.  This CD is fantastic, has heart and rocks surprisingly hard.  My favorite tracks are Military Madness, Let's Impeach the President and the super rocking Shock and Awe.  I enjoyed how, at the end of Let's Impeach the President, half of the audience boos.....and Mr. Young replies, \\"Thank you, freedom of speech.\\"  I was also surprised how well older songs like Deja Vu and Wooden Ships are performed...both excellently.  Stephen Stills sounds & plays great on For What It's Worth...my only minor quibble with the CD is, I would've liked to hear more of Mr. Stills...but it doesn't matter.  This CD is GREAT!  If you're considering buying it but are hesitant due to the age of the performers or whatever, I urge you to ignore your hesitancy and get it.  What a pleasant surprise it is.
B000OCY7JE|4.0|**** 2006. Story and direction by the Danish director Susanne Bier. Nominated for the Academy award in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Jacob Pederson manages an orphanage in Bombay, India. Now, he has to fly home to Denmark in order to meet a potential donor who's also his former girlfriend's husband. With a twirling camera, inherited from the Dogma artistic movement, Susanne Bier handles a very interesting theme: can you make people happy in spite of them ? Can you, like an ancient god, rule people's lives without their knowledge and, most of all, is this interaction morally defendable when good comes of it ? I'll remember for a long time the performance of Rolf Lassgård as Jørgen Lennart Hannson, a man used to be obeyed and who never accepts no for an answer. Highly recommended.
B0000DJE9R|4.0|Before he was Whacko Jacko, he was a brilliant musical star, a man who revolutionized expectations of what a recording artist could do. Michael Jackson had a moment of star-crossed genius when he (along with a dream team that included Quincy Jones, among others) recorded [[ASIN:B000WS4QJG Thriller]], an album to this day is a benchmark of how pop can be both immaculate and stunning at the same time.<br /><br />What happened after is stuff of legend. Michael Jackson became a man obsessed...not just the tabloid crap that dominates his legacy, but with topping his best work. The evidence here is that he often touched moments for pure brilliance (\\"Man in The Mirror,\\" \\"Black and White\\") but also trapped himself into self-repetition (\\"Dirty Diana\\" aping \\"Beat It\\" and \\"Billie Jean\\"). There are also moments when Jackson's self proclaimed hype made the songs into self-parody (\\"Your butt is mine...?\\" from the squeaky clean [[ASIN:B00005QGAX Bad]]). He at times seemed so desperate to shatter expectations that he seemed tone-deaf to what his audience expected or what his limits could be, like the controversial crotch grabbing/property smashing coda to the original \\"Black and White\\" video.<br /><br />Since \\"Number Ones\\" is presented in chronological order, you can also hear how Jackson starts to short circuit by the time he gets past the [[ASIN:B00005QGAV Dangerous]] period. \\"You Are Not Alone\\" is the last really good song on this CD, and there are five more left. (I'm counting the superfluous live rendition of \\"Ben.\\") \\"Earth Song\\" is trite, and the material from [[ASIN:B00005Q4JH Invincible]] sounds forced, almost desperate. From a lesser R&B singer, they would have been passable, but from a man who once contractually demanded that anyone who wanted face-time with the star refer to him as \\"The King of Pop,\\" second tier didn't cut it.<br /><br />However, when you listen to those songs that made Jackson a super-nova....the insistent dance-pop of \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,\\" the driving paranoia of \\"Billie Jean,\\" the snarling \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and just the memory of Jackson moon walking, you can forgive him for a lot of his indiscretions.f \\"Billie Jean,\\" the snarling \\"Smooth Criminal\\" and just the memory of Jackson moon walking, you can forgive him for a lot of his indiscretions.
0670020745|4.0|As a pastor, I felt particularly drawn to this book after hearing an author interview on the radio.  Everyone seems to know someone who has experienced having a stroke and ministering and caring for them is sometimes puzzling to all.  This book gave some wonderful \\"insights\\" about the actual experience from inside when a stroke is occuring as well as helpful suggestions for those that come into contact with them - whether it be family or medical situations.  Members of my congregation appreciated the suggestions presented in the book; several also intend to read it.

B0018CWWLE|5.0|This is the Genesis DVD by which all others should be compared. Fantastic looking picture and crisp sound, this DVD captures Genesis in the new millenium. I had longed for a reunion, if for nothing more than just to see what kind of show they'd come up with. I was not let down. The band sounds as if no time had passed since the last tour with Phil 15 years ago. The stage was in typical Genesis style - unusual yet functional. This tour also had the most amazing screen visuals of any Genesis tour to date. Billed as the largest tour screen ever, it certainly appears to live up to it's name. Genesis concerts were always an event. You knew you'd be taken on a journey, and this reunion tour was like taking a trip with a good friend you hadn't seen in years. The set list had the standard Genesis concert fare, with some tasty nuggets thrown in as well. The band genuinely seemed to be enjoying themselves. The Rome audience was enthusiastic and loud where they were supposed to be. I was very pleased with this DVD. The extras were interesting as well. The documentary was informative. Behind the scenes footage of each song showed the band rehearsing as they slowly pieced the concert together. The set was a bit hefty price-wise, having bought it as an import, but the discs are region-free, so it was worth every penny.
B000005JA8|4.0|Push the envelope and learn why the obscure Captain Beefheart is a major influence on so many later music.  He and Zappa are two peas in a pod but they are probably the only two.  Trout Mask Replica is an exploration of musical daring, worthwhile for any music lover but don't expect to be soothed to sleep, this demands your attention!  A squid eating dough in a polyethylene bag is fast and bulbous, got me?
B00004ZKSN|5.0|It's not an uncommon case when most people are in agreement about what an artist's best album is. It's considerably rarer when there's a general consensus about what an artist's best and second-best record is. Van Morrison seems to be one such case. Most Van fans agree that this, while not QUITE as good as Astral Weeks, is good enough to earn the #2 slot. Part of me wants to give St. Dominic's Preview that award, but that's not to step on Moondance. It's definitely one of Van's very best albums. And it's a total shift from Astral Weeks, with Van going all-out R&B and succeeding. For instance, by singing \\"Crazy Love\\" in a delicate, sexy falsetto, and by making the song an ode to the healing powers of, well, crazy love, he makes a fine case for being Ireland's answer to Al Green. And you know what? This record is at least as good as Green's masterpiece, I'm Still in Love with You.<br />Despite the awesomeness of \\"Crazy Love,\\" my favorite here is \\"Caravan,\\" a powerful paean to the radio. I love every aspect of it (especially the perfectly arranged chorus, with gritty horns and ascending piano supplanting the catchy \\"la, la, la-la, la-la-la's\\"), but my favorite part is the bridge, a bit of call-and-response between Van (\\"Turn it up!\\") and the horns (*bap-bup!*) that eventually leads to that wonderful chorus. And there's more greatness than those two songs, too! In fact, out of these ten songs, a full seven are unbelievably good. Two are just \\"good,\\" and one is \\"sort of okay.\\"<br />You've probably heard the title track, a fusion of jazz, blues, and pop. This is gonna sound cheesy, but it really takes you away to that magic autumn night he keeps talking about. \\"And it Stoned Me\\" has the same nostalgic vibe as most of Astral Weeks, but it's more of a soul-folk song, with a great piano part and an acoustic guitar solo. I have this obsession with acoustic guitar solos that I can't really explain. \\"Into the Mystic\\" is another example of one of Van's \\"song-long crescendos,\\" and as usual, when the song reaches that climax it's been building to... dude... \\"IIIIII wanna roooock your gyyypsy soooul...\\" By the way, the entire first side of this record is a radio staple. And that's not all I love about this, either. You've also got \\"Glad Tidings,\\" a lovely, swinging, jazzy song with another catchy nonsense refrain (\\"Nananana, nananana...\\"), and the slow, moving sermon \\"Brand New Day.\\"<br />Now for the simply good songs. \\"These Dreams of You\\" isn't one of my favorite Van Morrison songs, but it's fun, light, and has a nice harmonica part. And if you haven't heard the live version on It's Too Late to Stop Now, make it a priority. Similarly, \\"Everyone\\" isn't great, but it's good, and has a nice flute part. Still, it's a bit unusual to hear a guy who would probably punch your face in if you looked at him funny singing about peace, love, understanding, and other hippie ideals. The one song I'm not a huge fan of is \\"Come Running.\\" The chorus is great, but it's nothing special. Still, when you consider the strength of the other songs...<br />This is an essential album. Not as essential as Astral Weeks, but it's definitely the first Van album to get. Others might put you off for one reason or another, but this is a fine starting point.ual, when the song reaches that climax it's been building to... dude... \\"IIIIII wanna roooock your gyyypsy soooul...\\" By the way, the entire first side of this record is a radio staple.

B001AW9DKK|5.0|This is both an excellent live album and soundtrack of the film, the old boys are alive and well. The political content is upsetting a few people,apparently, and even more so considering it is coming from a Canadian(the songs attacking the government were written by Young), however the U.S promotes itself as leader of the Free World and should expect feedback from people of the free world. Fortunately most people understand this.<br /><br />The record kicks off with the band and audience singing a rousing version of Crosby's \\"What Are Their Names?\\" Then Young's solo piano introduces the Living with war theme.  \\"After the Garden\\" and Nash's \\"Military Madness\\" are followed by Young's \\"Let's Impeach The President\\" that concludes with much booing and heckling together with applause, about a 50/50 mix, and then Young's wry comment - \\"Thank you, freedom of speech\\".<br /><br />The record contains several Crosby and Nash cuts from their back catalogue as well as Stills' \\"For What It's Worth\\" the remainder are from Young's Living With War CD's and the added vocals of CS&N give these new life.These guys still have wonderful voices, a crack band with Chad Cromwell, Rick Rosas, Ben Keith and Spooner Oldham and thought provoking lyrics that make this a very entertaining piece of music.
B00004WNS5|5.0|This is my favorite Van Morrison album by a very long shot. I got it in summer 2006 (the best summer of my life thus far), and despite the fact that I only picked it up in the last week of August, it quickly became an integral part of my soundtrack during that wonderful summer, along with A Love Supreme and The Velvet Underground and Nico (two other masterpieces). But it's not just nostalgia that determines this my favorite Van album. It's also the strength of the songs. And the wistful lyrics, which paint a clear portrait of Van's youth in Belfast, Ireland. And the music, a combination of jazz, R&B, and folk. And Van's vocals. He sings like a man possessed on several of these tracks.<br />If you're a Van fan, you've probably heard several stories about this album's genesis. Like how it was cut over three sessions in New York shortly after Van escaped his dead-end contract with Bang records. Or how most of the musicians who recorded it were jazz musicians, including Connie Kay of the Modern Jazz Quartet or Richard Davis, who does some of the best bass playing in history on this record, especially on the title song and \\"Madame George\\" and also showed up on Eric Dolphy's wonderful Out to Lunch LP. Or how the flautist on these recordings was never properly identified. Or how Van locked himself up in a glass box during all of the sessions, never introducing himself to his own musicians. Or how, when asked by his band how they wanted him to play, he told them to play whatever they felt like, not even giving them anything to base their playing off of outside of a few chords he strummed on his acoustic guitar.<br />Needless to say, there's a lot of mystique surrounding this record, and even more in the music itself. This is the kind of album that can really take you away to a fantasy world. It'll take you away to another time, another place. The album's reincarnation themeed title track is especially good at doing so, and makes for a great way to start a masterpiece of an album. I don't even notice its seven minutes. I just sit back, and let the flute, the bass, the vibes, the vocals, and everything else about it wash over me.<br />But the real meat is in tracks three through six. \\"Sweet Thing\\" is my favorite Van Morrison song ever. Van's vocals are as raw and intense as they've ever been, and his lyrics are downright poetic. The piping, improvised flute solos are gorgeous, and the licks played by the string quartet are gripping. \\"Cypress Avenue\\" is another just classic. It's based on a blues structure, but it's not really blues, because the main hooks are played on a harpsichord and a fiddle. The fiddle is the highlight of the piece, constantly adding its own lines of melody and giving the song more depth. \\"The Way Young Lovers Do\\" is a clever tune, mixing Baroque string arrangements with Stax-Volt horns and culminating in a jazzy trumpet break. And \\"Madame George\\" establishes one of my favorite trends in Van's music: basing a song around a single, simple groove that gradually reveals itself to bea song-long crescendo. And when this particular the crescendo hits its peak, it moves me. Add the crying strings, the wonderful bass work, and the lyrics, and you've got a masterpiece. Much have been made about the lyrics, with some saying that \\"Madame George\\" is a drag queen. Van has claimed that \\"Madame George\\" is, in fact, a composite of people Van knew from his Belfast childhood. Whatever the song's true meaning (though it's worth noting that Van's real name is George Ivan Morrison), the lyrics are pure poetry.<br />There are other fine tracks here, too. \\"Slim Slow Slider\\" manages to be a restrained free jazz song, moving from a truly haunting beginning to a chaotic conclusion that I think is supposed to be symbolic of a drug addict's death. For some reason, people tend to dislike \\"Beside You,\\" but I think it's a nicely moody composition with wonderful vocals and a gorgeous flute part. To me, the closest thing to a weak spot is \\"Ballerina.\\" It's not bad - in fact, it's really pretty, and has a good arrangement - but it rambles, and it's unimpressive compared to the other seven compositions.<br />This isn't really an album as much as it is an experience. A beautiful, intense, ethereal, haunting experience. It's unlike any other record I own. It's a genre unto its own - the record's an impossible one to classify. I've heard over twenty Van Morrison discs, but even the best of them can't match up to this.

1416550518|1.0|Though the description of the book promised suspense, I found that it did not deliver.  The plot twists were utterly boring and I found the ending to be a let down.  Another reason I was not fond of this book was because of the author's overly forced writing style.  There were far too many cliches and the style of writing was too sentimental and dramatic.  I felt that I wasted my time reading this book.  It was not a stimulating read, however you might like it if you are a simpleton.
0670020745|5.0|Absolutely fascinating journey into the mind of a stroke victim. Not just any stroke victim but someone educated in the anatomy of the brain. Amazing detail about the differing functions of the left and right sides of our brain and what it might be like to temporarily lose the output from the left. Enhanced my appreciation for how they work so well together.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I don't like live albums, but John Mayer added enough to each and every song to keep things interesting.  As if that's not enough, his versions of \\"Free Falling\\" and \\"I Don't Need No Doctor\\" it worth buying.  This is a good listen for John Mayer obsessed freaks and casual fans of his hits.  I recommend it.
0783225903|5.0|What can I possibly say about this movie that hasn't already been said?  I'm just sitting here, a day later, still blown away.<br /><br />Made in 1985, its predictions of a techno-future are eerily prescient while at the same time looking way cooler.  Or more probably filming was happening in 1984, since it has shades of that fine novel.  A hint of Clockwork Orange...<br /><br />And really, comparing it to anything else is just wrong.<br /><br />We have the menacing future, yet we have some powerfully conceived and brilliantly acted characters, in a plot that's fast and fascinating, along with what the cover rightfully calls biting humor.  I was constantly laughing in the most inappropriate places, precisely as intended.<br /><br />I don't give many five-star reviews.  That means I'm keeping the movie and watching it again (and again).  In this case, at the end of its 2 hours and 23 minutes, I really wanted to play it again immediately.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and top notch special effects that'll blow you away, and the kind of sets I really wish I could've guarded back in my security guard days.<br /><br />But I digress.  Get this movie.  It'll definitely live up to your expectations, and then some.
B001B71NOI|4.0|I think this review is more a response to some of the complaining here than anything else.  Yes 10-14 years ago Reznor looked like he might be the biggest musical genius in at least a generation.  No, that hasn't turned out to be the case.  His last real masterpiece was the Fragile.  If you include Still, he's done 5 albums since then.  It should be pretty clear by now exactly what he does and that he probably won't be reinventing the wheel again.  If you're still around after all this time and all these albums, you have to be taking some pleasure from the records he's doing.  Yes, it would be fair to call him a 2 trick pony (if you include his other formula for ballads), but he's good at it- very, very good at it.  My advice is to just sit back and enjoy the ride (silly lyrics and all).  It's taken me some getting used to the fact that new NIN albums now only stay in heavy rotation for a month or two (TDS was in constant rotation for over a year, and the Fragile has managed to stay in regular rotation for an amazing 9 years now), but compare to anyone besides Reznor, a month of heavy rotation is quite respectable.    Just take him for what he is now, and enjoy him.  That's my advice.  He's still quite talented.

B001B71NOI|1.0|There are only two tracks worth listening to - Corona Radiata and Four of Us Are Dying. The rest are disappointing on several counts - not great songs, there is nothing majorly innovative and lyrics are utterly forgettable. The most disappointing thing about this album is the drums/rhythm, which is where NIN has always stayed ahead of everyone else. Ghosts created some lofty expectations, but this is a major let down.
B0013LPS8Y|5.0|Forget the original remaster. You might as well throw that in the trash. THIS is the version you need to own. U2's 1983 masterpiece 'War' gets the remaster-and-reissue treatment, something that it has long since deserved.     The record is digitally remastered, meaning the sound quality is great. Island Records did a great job. While 'The Joshua Tree' was their breakthrough, 'War' guaranteed they were here to stay.     This album has many of your favorite U2 songs from the '80s. 'Sunday Bloody Sunday,' 'New Year's Day,' '40,' 'Two Hearts Beat As One,' 'Seconds,' and 'Surrender' are fan favorites, and they are all here on 'War.'    The bonus disc, however, is not as good as 'October' and 'Boy,' but it is really good. One of my personal favorite U2 songs is a rarity, and it is 'Treasure.' That song is a great punk song, and is clearly influenced by The Clash and The Jam. It's a fast song, and I classify it as a \\"speed punk\\" tune.    'Endless Deep' is a great instrumental. If you own the bonus disc of 'The Best of 1980-1990,' which is 'B-Sides 1980-1990,' than you already own this song. But it's great. It's dominated by The Edge's piano playing.     'Angels Too Tied To The Ground' is a previously unreleased tune. It's a great one, no doubt. Why this was never released before 2008 and has always been stored away in a vault is beyond me. If you are a die-hard U2 fan like I am, than you must hear this song.    The live tracks were recorded at the festival Rock Werchter. Werchter is a village in Belgium, and every year, they have a rock festival, and U2 were an act at the festival in 1982. 'Fire' and 'I Threw A Brick Through A Window/A Day Without Me' were recorded in Werchter, and are probably the best live versions of the songs I've heard yet (Trust me, as a collector of U2 bootlegs for years, I've heard tons of versions.) These are far superior to the studio versions.    The remixes are intended for the U2 collectors and die-hards. The remixes of 'New Year's Day' and 'Two Hearts Beat As One' are great. I own several of the remixes because I bought the singles and EPs. But these are great because they are remastered.    Overall, buy the 2008 remaster of 'War.' I don't care if you bought it when it first came out to CD or when it was remastered in the nineties, buy this edition. If you haven't bought 'War' yet, buy this edition.    Highly recommended for any U2 fan. If you haven't bought this, you need to. A must-have.    ENJOY!!!

0807286095|5.0|I hear that they are making a movie of this book that should come out by 2011.  I only wish 2 things: 1)they don't take so many liberties; 2)that it would come out sooner, Christmas 2009, perhaps.  I really don't know why I like this book.  I've never read its \\"adult counterpart\\" 1984 by George Orwell.  It is a Newberry award winner.  While I read many Newberry winners as a child, I didn't read this one until I was grown.  Maybe that's good because some things about this book may shock children.  It is very cerebral until the end, not your usual children's book, in my opinion.  I guess I enjoy it because it is disturbing and also hopeful.  It teaches readers of any age to appreciate things that we now take for granted and gives us a look at what life would be like without them.  A Dark but Wonderful Read!
B0002XVQNU|5.0|It is a shame that whomever in the movie industry decided to wreck the theatrical release of this movie, once I watched the directors cut of this movie I could not believe how much better of a movie this is and more than likely would have faired better at the box office and would not have been one of the final death knells of Ben Affleck's movie career

B000244EMO|5.0|The opinions presented in the various reviews regarding the quality of the transfer of this (1987) film to DVD span the full range from horrible to excellent. My comments are based on the 2-disc \\"Widescreen Collector's Edition\\" of \\"Predator\\". The format of this edition is anamorphic widescreen which was also enhanced for 16 x 9 aspect ratio screens since the picture fills the entire TV screen.    For the most part, the transfer of sound and picture is excellent. The only problem is that the video transfer is not consistently excellent. Most of the scences look crystal sharp with great color on my large-screen, high-definition LCD TV (played on a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player--the \\"upconversion\\" helps)--but then there are short segments (a few seconds here and there) where the image becomes suddenly quite grainy--but, since most of these grainy segments are night scences, the problem is not too obvious. Most of the night scenes, however, are crystal clear and sharp with fantastic contrast. Luckily, the grainy segments are very brief in duration and do not really detract from the overall entertainment value of the movie.     Nonetheless, this exciting, suspenseful, classic Arnold film deserves a high-definition remastering.

B0014VPFTA|5.0|By far the best John Mayer cd out there. look out for tracks Stop This Train, Say, and my personal but highly unpublicized Slow Dancing In a Burning Room. Well written, a good cd for vegging out or getting ready to go out. the one downside is that it only has thirteen tracks, but trust me, you will get your money's worth out of these! Especially read the insert in the front of the cd case!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I just received Tour V2 as a warrenty replacement for the Pro Tour that I returned as defective.  The Tour V2 is so far superior to the Pro Tour especially the pin seeker feature. It recognizes the flag, even when it is limp, and bingo you have the yardage.  Battery life of the Pro Tour was a problem and supposedly the V2 is far superior. We'll see.
0756404746|4.0|This is a great book. Arguably the best fantasy novel of last year.  Clear prose and wonderful, complex plotting remind me of Martin (fewer characters to juggle perhaps).      Unfortunately, buyers beware, Rothfuss is like Martin in another way too.  He writes slowly and misses deadlines.  I highly recommend waiting until the series is done. (He already extended the date for the second book by a year).      Great book that will make you want more but there is no more until Spring 09 - if he makes that date.  We'll see if he is truly Martin-esque if about December he pushes the date again.

B000056BOR|1.0|A major failure from some incredible talent in front of and behind the camera.  Who came up with this ridiculous story for such a great team as Cary Grant and Doris Day?  It is a terrible waste of two screen greats and a totally worthless experience.  If you like the typical comedies from either of these stars, you will probably not like this movie.  For each it's one of their worst--and Cary Grant looks like he is just walking through his role with no emotion.
B00008PC2O|5.0|Well, almost everyone knows that T2 is a kick@$$ film by the brilliant director James Cameron. And it's true that this sequel far surpasses the original (though I did like the darker and creepier tone of the original). Cast have done an excellent job (especially Robert Patrick as the T-1000, and Joe Morton as Miles Dyson). Special Effects are spectacular, and they are much more realistic than today's effects. Music and cinematography are intriguing. And finally, the Extreme DVD is a big plus (picture and sound quality are perfect), though I might have to buy the Ultimate Edition for the special features.<br /><br />A+++
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Easily the best Hitchcock or Cary Grant movie ever made--filled with suspense and comedy throughout.  It works as well today as it did almost 50 years ago and doesn't seem dated.  This movie can be watched over and over again with great pleasure. By now you know the classic cropduster scenes and Mt. Rushmore scene, but there are other great parts of the film as well. Other than it maybe being a bit long during the love scenes, this movie is picture perfect.    It's one of my top five movies of all time.
B000O1799U|5.0|I am not normally a fan of musicals, and this was DEFINITELY a musical, but I was mesmerized from the first solo by Jennifer Hudson, and after that I was hooked. I have never been so impressed by the power of a musical to reach into one's emotions and actually add to the power of a drama. I usually just wait out the singing parts of award winning movies with musical numbers (or fast forward on DVD), but not this time. Jennifer brought tears to my eyes twice during this movie and in general the singing really enhanced the overall experience. Hurray for Dreamgirls. I'm so glad they decided to make the play into a movie, so that more people can experience it.

0452289963|4.0|If you were to say that this book inspires a completely new way of thinking, you would be wrong. That's because new-age guru Eckhart Tolle bases his teachings on the existing concept of moving beyond thinking. He explains that you can only connect to the energy that flows through the universe only when you hush the incessant voice in your head. This book made a huge media splash early in 2008 when Oprah Winfrey selected it for her bestseller-making book club and encouraged worldwide discussion of it via live Web seminars. Readers eagerly shared their \\"aha moments\\" online, citing points in the book that ignited their \\"shifts in consciousness.\\" And yet anyone who is at all familiar with Eastern philosophies will not find Tolle's messages quite so groundbreaking. For instance, the concept of ego transcendence has been part of the Eastern spiritual lexicon for centuries. getAbstract agrees that Tolle's guidance fulfills a need for current-day seekers, and recommends it to anyone who relishes the spiritual quest for authentic selfhood and inner stillness, or who is simply curious to discover what provoked all the buzz.
B00005Q3TZ|4.0|I have always been a history nut, so I really looked forward to this movie when it came out in the theater.  I believe the visualizations were superb, with the CG in the action sequences very well done.  The story line was a little long, but the acting was very good as well.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys WWII historical movies.  I only wish that a newer version of the battle of Midway would be shot.
B0017R5UA0|5.0|If you're considering the new Fleet Foxes album, you won't be disappointed.  These days I don't love a lot of bands that are out there.  I think I find an album or two a year that I really love.  Fleet Foxes album and EP though are magnificent.  A summer night outside with a glass of wine and this music is magical.  \\"White Winter Hymnal\\", \\"Ragged Wood\\", \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\", \\"He Doesn't Know Why\\"... I'm just trying to say the highlights of them album!  They're all good tracks.    Anyway, if you're considering the album I recommend getting it on vinyl.  You not only get the album on vinyl with a great looking gatefold sleeve, but you ALSO get their Sun Giant EP on vinyl too!  Not only that, you also get a certificate to download the mp3's of both the album and the EP!!!  Amazing.  Thankfully bands like Fleet Foxes and labels like Sub Pop exist.

My 3 year old loves the elevator. Seems to be a good quality, durable toy. I think he will have lots of fun with it. It would be helpful if you have a table to put it on so kids can get at it at eye level. My only complaint would be that the garage levels are close together. Hard to get hands in there to move the cars around. As an adult its pretty hard. Seems like my 3 year old does ok but it is a bit awkward.

0345495004|4.0|Loving Frank is a great, engrossing read, the story of the relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney, a relationship that began when both were married, with children, to other people.  A relationship of that kind would be shocking today, and Nancy Horan does a great job of conveying the absolute scandal it created a hundred years ago.  The scandal, however is not the focus of the book.  Rather, it is the relationship between these two soul mates and how their individual flaws slowly surface and chip away, but not completely, at their relationship.  These two historical figures were indeed unique characters in their brilliance and inability to really see the scandal and hurt their love creates.  Horan's novel is engrossing and readable.  She manages to make both characters likeable, if not entirely sympathetic.  My only complaint is that the novel starts off rather slowly.  Once you are past the first 50 pages or so, the pacing picks up, making this novel a thoroughly engrossing read.  Horan writes extremely well, so even those first 50 pages are quite enjoyable to read.  This novel would be an excellent choice for any book club--an enjoyable read with many provocative topics to discuss and explore.

1401216676|5.0|Wow... just wow!  This short story was recently updated, with Brian Bolland recoloring (and apparently sketching in a few new details) the original comic.  This is a Joker-origin story, though as the Joker himself admits, he doesn't remember his own past well.  In his words, \\"Sometimes I remember it one way, sometimes another... If I'm going to have a past, I prefer it to be multiple choice!\\"  The short summary is that the Joker escapes from Arkham, only to have Batman discover he's missing when he goes to try and offer something resembling a peace treaty.  This escape isn't about crime or money... it's about proving a point.  One bad day is all it takes to go from being an average person to a maniac or even a masked vigilante.  Before the Joker is through, two of Batman's closest friends and allies will have had their lives changed forever.<br /><br />Like I said before, the story is brief and to the point. Between moments of the story we see flashes of the Joker's past, of what he did to support himself and how he had his first run-in with Batman.  Bolland has washed out these flashbacks, leaving shades of red to stand out, tying in nicely with the Joker's first criminal persona. I guess some people thought the ending was ambiguous...  it does end with a joke, and I like how the moment was shared between the two of them.  I suppose if you were to take away the text in the box, it would look a different way, but I didn't really find it confusing.<br /><br />There!  That's fairly spoiler-free!  I did enjoy the Joker's lines about a coffee-table edition... being a librarian myself, I hope to never be in the same situation.  :P<br /><br />For a little added oomph, Brian Bolland included his short story \\"An Innocent Guy.\\"  I enjoyed the giant typewriter.

That section of the book is needed so the reader can fully comprehend the whole situation.  Besides, it is quite interesting.  Well worth it.
B000FSME1A|5.0|Holy smokes. Where to begin. This film is epic. This film is amazing. This film is wild. Nobody makes films like this anymore. Powerful, mind bending, insane. Coppola famously said that this wasn't a film about the Vietnam war, this is the Vietnam war. If you haven't seen this yet, see it. So many classic scenes, so many classic lines, and such a powerful film. Great stuff.
B000002UB6|5.0|Technically their next to last album, \\"Let It Be\\" was released after \\"Abbey Road\\", one of those little marketing quirks that followed the Beatles throughout most of their career; most of the U.S. editions being quite different than the British editions. \\"Let It Be\\" was all about getting back to basics and away from the glorious studio experimentations that I'm most fond of. But the band had to keep growing and changing and I can't fault them for that. This disc is certainly unique in that there is arguably more 'filler' compared with their output from \\"Rubber Soul\\" to \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" and to some degree \\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album\\". The songs that fail to move me in any way include the traditional \\"Maggie Mae\\", George's bland \\"For You Blue\\", the aimless \\"Dig It\\" and \\"One After 909\\", the last a composition from their very early years. That said, their harmonies on \\"One After 909\\" come off as carefree and charming.<br />  There are quite a few gems here. Lyrically, much of the Beatles' latter output was concerned with the past, their childhoods, and other forms of nostalgic manifestations. This is certainly true of \\"Two Of Us\\" (intimate folksy pop) and both of Paul's majestic ballads \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"The Long And Winding Road\\", three of eight of the best songs to be found here. Speaking of majestic, John's \\"Across The Universe\\" is both lyrically and musically one of the most inventive songs to ever grace a Beatles record. I've heard artists as diverse as David Bowie, Alanis Morisette, and Rufus Wainwright do cover versions of \\"Universe\\" and each version is wonderful though none can truly compare to the original. The set is rounded out by \\"Dig A Pony\\", \\"Universe\\"'s lyrical sister, the soulful \\"I've Got A Feeling\\", George's witty take on egotism \\"I Me Mine\\" and of course, the rootsy \\"Get Back\\", the template and manifesto for this disc.<br />  One more remark on \\"Let It Be\\"- if you find yourself cringing at the production of the songs with orchestration on them (courtesy of Phil Spector), you should check out the somewhat recently released \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" which does away with said arguably distracting production and reorders the songs in the manner in which they were originally intended to be listened to.ourtesy of Phil Spector), you should check out the somewhat recently released \\"Let It Be...Naked\\" which does away with said arguably distracting production and reorders the songs in the manner in which they were originally intended to be listened to.

B000RJO58M|5.0|This movie is packed with action. It is super funny and just an all around great movie. It looked the best on HD-DVD. Let me say that I am into technology, when I stepped into a movie theater and saw the 1st HD-DVD commercial I ever saw, I was immediatly drawn to the format. I know it sounds weird and its hard to explain but I was drawn to HD-DVD, I was devestated when toshiba discontinued HD-DVD in febuary of 2008. But being as into technology as I am a continue to follow the latest trand which as unfortunate as it is, is BLU-RAY.     As weird as that sounds, its the truth.      If you have a HD-DVD player GET THIS MOVIE. If you dont GET THIS MOVIE ON DVD. When it come out (if it does) GET THIS MOVIE ON BLU-RAY.            HD-DVD: R.I.P
B00000J7SS|1.0|Do not be intimidated into pretending you like this recording because you might not look cool.  The main problem with this CD is that it is boring. Here's the formula: Take a has-been trumpeter who has lost his ability to play and add tons of reverb to his anemic solos. Add a bunch of great musicians who are all ten times better than the leader, but intimidated by his horrible personality. Let everyone jam without any direction. Give the CD an ugly cover and a stupid name. Defy anyone to be objective and realize what a total waste of time this is.
B00005QDW5|4.0|this is a good CD if you're a casual listener looking for Pink Floyd's best songs. less expensive and less cumbersome than buying their complete set and not bogged down by lesser songs. if you're a hard core fan you will probably find this CD lacking in continuity. Pink Floyd albums were not simply a collection of singles they were a coherent continuous package. that continuity is lost when compiling a greatest hits album.
0765350386|4.0|I've been keeping an eye out for this author's novels, because he's the guy writing the 12th book of the Wheel of Time from Robert Jordan's notes.  I wanted to see if he had the authorial chops to handle the task he's taken on.<br /><br />Short answer: Maybe.<br /><br />Mistborn was really good; apart from the whole WoT thing, Sanderson is definitely an author I'd want to keep up with. The concept was brilliant: the idea that this novel takes places a thousand years after the great hero, the chosen one, comes to save the world -- and fails.  One of the best parts was the characters' belief that he must have succeeded, because the world hasn't been destroyed -- but it's so dystopian and nasty that the reader has to wonder if, in fact, the world has been largely destroyed, and they just don't know any better.  A wonderful starting point.<br /><br />The positives: the writing was strong, though a bit plain; the magic system and the world were outstanding, one of the best fantasy settings I've seen in a while -- comparable in some ways with WoT, which is probably why he was tapped to write Book 12.  The concept is that there is an absolute dictatorship ruling this world, a single world-spanning empire with an immortal god-king at the head.  The world has turned ugly, with volcanoes spewing a constant stream of ash and smoke into the sky, blocking most of the sun's rays and leaving the people with brown plants and a world coated in black ash, which falls like rain.  The empire has divided people into nobility and peasants, and the peasants suffer just as they did in the feudal system of the Middle Ages: they exist only to serve the nobility, who slaughter them wholesale just for amusement, and who work very hard to crush their spirits, mostly with great success.<br /><br />The book is about a group of people, thieves, who try to organize an uprising in order to overthrow the all-powerful emperor, slaughter the nobles, and free the people -- and make themselves impossibly rich in the process.  The cast of characters were mostly good, though some of the secondary characters were a bit cliche -- a soldier who tries to think like a philosopher, but honestly, his philosophical questions are a bit ho-hum (The best one was: if the Lord Ruler is actually a piece of God, as his reputation has it, then doesn't his divinity make his actions morally right, and thus make our insurrection the wrong thing to do?), and then there are the overweight bombastic politico, the quiet organizer, and the cantankerous old man.  But the main characters were much better, and the magic system -- which is based around metals, which the magic-users ingest and then \\"burn\\" to gain magical powers -- was both subtle and intricate, as well as being basically straightforward and easy to follow.<br /><br />The plot was great, though again, there were little cliche moments that irritated me slightly -- I could have done without the love interest, for one, as the lowborn main character falls for the one noble with a heart of gold.  But the ending was outstanding, and the image of the villains -- the Inquisitors, horribly powerful, immortal servants of the Lord Ruler -- was inspired: instead of eyes, they have steel spikes driven through their heads, with the tips protruding from the backs of their skulls and the square ends of the spikes right where their eyes should be.  That was fantastic.<br /><br />So basically, Sanderson has the imagination to keep up with the Wheel of Time, but not really the storytelling skills, at least not in this book.  Unfortunately, the imaginative parts of WoT are already done for him, so this doesn't play to his strengths.  I'm hoping his other books show better writing.t of characters were mostly good, though some of the secondary characters were a bit cliche -- a soldier who tries to think like a philosopher, but honestly, his philosophical questions are a bit ho-hum (The best one was: if the Lord Ruler is actually a piece of God, as his reputation has it, then doesn't his divinity make his actions morally right, and thus make our insurrection the wrong thing to do?), and then there are the overweight bombastic politico, the quiet organizer, and the cantankerous old man.

0060786523|5.0|Hello Book-Lovers of the Amazon World,<br /><br />Today, I finished reading \\"A Suitable Boy\\" by Vikram Seth.  I spent most of the month of July '08, except for a 9 day holiday in Ontario, Canada, reading this massive and informative book about Post-Independence India.<br />Mr. Vikram Seth has populated the story with memorable charactors, such as Lata Mehra, Mrs. Rupha Mehra, Mahesh Kapoor and his family,the Nawab Sahib and many others that flit in and out of the novel as it progresses to the conclusion.<br /><br />I may be wrong, but I think Mr Seth wrote himself into the story as Amit Chatterji, the Poet and author who was one of the young men who was trying to become Lata's husband.<br /><br />The descriptive language made you feel you were in Bramphur ( a fictional city ) and Calcutta( The main venues). The great festivals of the Hindu, Muslim and Bengali and Punjabi peoples were vividly portrayed.<br />The National Elections of 1952 makes our election process seem tame by comparison.<br />Some people have compared this story to Eliot's \\"Middlemarch\\" and Dicken's \\"Bleak House\\". Well, it may be true,but, I havent finished \\"Bleak House\\", yet, and I couldnt get into \\"Middlemarch\\" ( the language was too Victorian for my tastes). I traded the Eliot book up in Canada for 2 used books in D. Gabaldon's \\"Outlander\\" series.  I am going to start reading them next.<br /><br />I STRONGLY RECOMMEND this book.  This massive book looks intimidating but is well-worth the time and money to have in your personal library.<br /><br />Until my next review, keep on reading, it's cheaper ( in the long run ) and more enjoyable than watching the \\"[...]\\".
0385340990|5.0|Several years ago, I worked at an art gallery here in Anchorage.  Though I loved the art, I wasn't much good at selling it.  More often than not, I just chatted up the customers, who were from all over the world.<br /><br />One night, four elderly people wandered in.  They told me they were from a tiny island off the coast of southern England called \\"Guernsey\\".  I'd never heard of it, so they proudly explained it was the only part of British soil that had been occupied by the Nazis during World War II.  The island was occupied for a long five years; an experience to which they had all been witnesses.  At that moment, Guernsey was marked in my mind.<br /><br />Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrow's new book, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is an opportunity to travel back in time to 1946 Guernsey.<br /><br />Beginning early 1946 in London, Juliet Ashton, a British writer, and former war journalist, is emerging from the ashes of the war to rebuild her life and her identity.  She has lost her home and all her possessions, most regrettably her book collection.  Out of the blue, she responds to correspondence started by a resident of Guernsey, who has managed to obtain a second-hand book once owned by Juliet, in which she had long ago written her name and address.  Through this initial contact, Juliet meets an entire community, and the course of her life is redirected.<br /><br />Easily reminiscent of Helene Hanff's epistolary classic, \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\", the novel is written in the epistolary style.  Shaffer and Barrow skillfully use this medium to successfully establish their characters and a solid storyline.<br /><br />Charming, funny, sweet, and thoughtful, \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is a story that women might find more appealing than men.  Yet, it is unflinching in its wartime recollections.  The deprivations and devastation of the time are imaginatively and convincingly conveyed.<br /><br />At its core, this is a book about the love of reading, and the magic of books.<br /><br />I highly, highly recommend \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\".oks.

B0018SRV3W|5.0|I have a lot to say about those who have reviewed this film negatively but since it's against the \\"review guidelines,\\" I can't.<br />This was a fantastic movie!<br />In defense of the historical aspects of the film: I applaud the writers and directors for giving us a better view of civilization in ancient times than what we are used to. We are not often told that Homo Sapien has existed in its exact form since 250,000 B.C. Same brain size, same body size, same ability to reason, same capacity to love. Pick up a history book and prove it to yourself. Amazon has thousands of them! They were masters of the world they lived in at the time, like we are masters of the world we live in today. Historically, this film is more accurate than inaccurate. Put aside the presupposition that the pyramids were built around 2500 B.C. according to our accepted historical time-line and what you have is a wealth of imagery describing how we hunted the mammoth, how we captured the saber tooth tiger and how we were hunted and eaten by downgraded dinosaurs in the form of giant birds!<br />Is it conceivable that racism didn't exist between the dark skinned tribes of the African savannah and the pale skinned men of the mountains? Or did they wonder at each other? Dreams and visions are often mentioned in ancient literature as belonging to the most sacred member of a tribe. It's Shaman, mystic, medicine man, etc! These people busied themselves with knowledge and wisdom while everyone else in the clan had their purpose and goals. Wouldn't you want to see how they might have lived, created, communicated, learned, stood together side by side united for a cause and died for what they believed in! And how appropriate that this work is a love story! No one can deny that as a race, man's awareness to love spans the ages, knows no limit and sets us apart from animal instinct!<br />I can understand how those who are not fans of ancient history can sit back and wonder why the dumb cave man isn't poking sticks into an anthill to eat the ants but the reality is, that cave man is you without technology! Could you hunt the African elephant without a rifle? Could you feed you family without a grocery store? Would you travel hundreds of miles on foot? Ancients were not dumb! They were brilliant at surviving and learning how to control their environment, or we would not be here today.<br />Most of what we think we know of ancient history is merely a lot of guesswork anyway. Compared to the complexity of human life, facts from these times are limited. The filmmakers have put together an incredible interpretation based on a mixture of fact, guesswork and pure fantasy! You want a documentary watch the history channel, you want a good story see this movie.n anthill to eat the ants but the reality is, that cave man is you without technology!

B00005QAPH|5.0|After 8 films, having acquired the status of an Italian icon (a much criticized one, of course, as with all Italian icons, which Italians - and Italo-Americans like me - take particular joy in tearing down) and overwhelming international fame, Fellini felt himself trapped, boxed in by demands and expectations and unable to create.  So he shattered the box, threw away his script and wrote this outrageous, self regarding, egoistic, surreal and utterly brilliant meditation on ....himself!  His predicament, his creative problems, his loves, his childhood, his aging, his fantasies.  As in the most famous scene, he takes the whip and makes the elements of his life dance around him... at least until he is overwhelmed.  And, for most folks, it works utterly.  You are swept away in the swirl of images and emotions, and willingly allow yourself to go along for the ride.  The world, as with most of the reviewers here, loved it.  After all, despite the relentlessly inward focus of the film, these concerns of life, love and aging are our own concerns, too.   His unforgettable images resonate with most of us.  Although not everyone is willing to go along for this particular ride, as attested to by the much smaller number of extremely negative reviews.  Hey, if you don't like the roller coaster, don't get on one!    But once you have taken such an extreme and self indulgent step - where do you go next?  Sadly, that is one problem which Fellini never solved.  After this, he mostly just made \\"Fellini films\\", repeating the same motifs and images that once seemed so daring, far past the point of self parody.  To be sure, there are some wonderful moments in \\"Amarcord\\" and \\"Roma\\".  In fact he rarely made a film without some things of real interest.  But never again was he anywhere near as consistently good, as much on the cutting edge of international film, as he was in the ten years from 1953 to 1963.  I Vitelloni (1953), La Strada (1954), Nights of Cabiria (1957), La Dolce Vita (1960), 8 1/2 (1963):  How many directors have a run like that, with so many unforgettable images?

Their first two albums VINCEBUS ERUPTUM and OUTSIDE INSIDE were recorded outside the studies because they were so loud. This album and OUTSIDE INSIDE is by far their best. Blazing lead solo's by Leigh Stevens will blow you away.Listen to PARCHMENT FARM and you will see what I mean. Blue Cheer was underrated. which is to bad because they are a great band Because of them we have hevey metel today. The album has only six songs but three were written by Dick Peterson{bass} Buy the album because I know you will enjoy it Rock On.

B0007TKNIS|3.0|(3.5) Going into a musical, one expects to open one's senses.  Andrew Lloyd Webber, not quite at the height of his powers, gives us a few reasons to celebrate his musical brought to the screen in Joel Schumacher's rendition of `Phantom of the Opera'.      There are two main interlocking stories, and while they give one another meaning, they sometimes are conflicting to the musical's spirit.  In front of the stage, Andre (Simon Cowell) has acquired the Paris Opera House.  He must keep everyone happy, particularly his siren voiced prima donna beauty, Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson).  She now must compete with her understudy, the equally alluring and talented, Christine (Emmy Rossum).  At night, darkness takes over as she is seduced by the mysterious \\"Phantom\\" (Gerard Butler).  He takes her beyond the underground of the city's sewers to his own lair.  However, like the classic story, his love of beauty reaches a vengeful crescendo.  The scenes where the two are together are filled with tenderness with Webber's songs truly suited for the occasion.  Chills run down one's spine during this element of the movie, but compared to [[ASIN:B00005NGAL Cats - The Musical (Ultimate Edition)]], Webber doesn't provide this often enough.      Schumacher's careful shooting is impeccable.  The camera turns in a cemetery scene are nearly flawless and the art direction is superb.  The focus, lighting, and framing are what all musicals should contain.  Besides the accomplished voices of Rossum and Richardson, both leading ladies have a breathtaking beauty.  Matched by early performances by Butler and Wilson, the movie provides hunky handsomeness for women as well.  There's a lot to look at in this beautiful film.      My main criticism is that some of the best elements are punctured by the main story.  We need to see the front of the stage to appreciate the backstage developments, but some of \\"the show must go on\\" sentiments and songs go better with `[[ASIN:B00008973A A Chorus Line]],' but not here.  A comparison with the best musicals, including '[[ASIN:B0006213XA The Sound of Music]],' '[[ASIN:076781326X Oliver!]]' '[[ASIN:B00004RF9F An American in Paris]],' `[[ASIN:6304712936 Amadeus]],' and the recent release of '[[ASIN:B0013D8LOK Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street]],' all point to a story and song venue that resonate much better throughout.      As a sensual feast, 'Phantom of the Opera' belts the best notes through the opera house; as a vehicle for the best songs and best story execution, the venue falters in places and makes all the atmospherics go flat.  I fault no one for their enthusiasm for this film, but the cohesiveness is spotty due to some of it's failings.         A J.P.'s Pick 3.5 *'s=Good-Very Good
B0002OXVDW|5.0|The product was delivered on a timely basis. Placing an order was easy and in all respects satisfactory.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|To be honest, the first time I listened to \\"Viva La Vida\\", I hated it.  I had just popped \\"Parachutes\\" out of my CD player to put this in, and it was such a departure from the piano-driven, earnest, love-lorn melodies of that first album that I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  I'd read all the reviews in Rolling Stone, Pitchfork, that praised Chris Martin's loss of his trademark falsetto and the go-to song structures, but I liked the old Coldplay.  Were they even still there, under all the synthesizers and the walls of sound?     I guess it's not really fair to judge a band's fourth album against their first, especially with a band like Coldplay, which has since risen to dizzying heights.  Once I took a step back and listened to \\"Viva La Vida\\" as its own album, instead of as another Parachutes or Rush of Blood to the Head, I appreciated it for what it was: more mature, more worldly, and without the rose-colored optimism of a young Chris Martin living in a \\"beautiful world\\".  It's a lot to take in, as he deals with somewhat darker themes, and the music is fittingly heavier and more epic.     \\"Viva La Vida\\" isn't as \\"experimental\\" as some might have you believe though: there are definitely points where they choose to play it safe lyrically rather than offend anyone, and the themes of life and death, light and darkness aren't exactly anything new.  After all, they're not going to want to alienate their entire fan base with this album.  So I wouldn't quite call it a re-invention: Coldplay's still there, after all, just a whole lot bigger (and better?), and quite poised to take over the world.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Great basic romantic love story. It just rings true and you know it if you ever really fell in love. The core of the story is very real, although the wrapping may be too sunny. Even for Southern California (and I lived there for 11 years). One whishes that life could be sometimes so beautiful. But one goes to the movies for that too. The cast is wonderful and Trevor Wright is that perfect dreamboy you can't look at him without loving him. One of those gay movies that deserves a much wider audience and stay with you for a long time.
B0011N1WE8|1.0|Penelope seemed like it would have been a good movie due to<br />Christina Ricci.  However I would have to say I was very disappointed in the whole storyline.  The storyline I thought lacked a lot of substance.  The storyline is basically Ricci is born and due to being the first girl born to the family she has a curse on her due to her grandfathers screwup.  She stays hidden waiting on someone that is well off to marry her which is supposedly a way of breaking the curse.  I won't spoil the story further but I would say I definately would have walked out of the theater after viewing about 20 minutes of the movie.
B00139W3NE|4.0|This was a decent, if cursory, adaptation of \\"The Golden Compass,\\" the first book in Philip Pullman's controversial \\"Dark Materials\\" trilogy. The original print version is both innovative and tendentious -- an absorbing fantasy world built as a means for the author to exercise his strong antipathy towards organized religion. The movie glosses over the anti-religious message, although not quite to the extent I'd imagined. The condensed plotline can be a bit jumpy, but on the whole this is an enjoyable action film, with the social commentary lurking just below the surface -- it's dumbed-down a little, but still basically the same as the book. Worth checking out. (Slipcue Film Reviews)
B0001WTWCO|5.0|The grand epic tale and love story, The English Patient, really requires multiple viewings to truly appreciate. When I watched it the first time it was the characters and their relationships that held my attention. The second time I was better able to understand the fairly complex plotline. And the third time I was able to admire the great look and cinematography of the film more than other viewings, as well as pay more attention to many small details within. I'm not going to go deep into the plot in this review. I'm just going to say it revolves around a man, Count Laszlo (Ralph Fiennes) who gets shot down in a plane during the Second World War, seriously burning just about all of his body. Hana (Juliette Binoche), a Canadian nurse makes a choice to stay behind her team and care for this English Patient (who isn't even English). The Count has lost quite a bit of his memory, but he regains it as she reads the book he had with him. Flashbacks then tell of his past story, mostly before the war, in North African and his relationship with the married Katherine Clifton (Christian Scott Thomas). Also in the present a stranger (William Dafoe) arrives and ads another layer of complexity to the story.      Now saying more that about the plot could diminish the experience for any seeing the film for the first time. I'll just add the performances of the four main leads are all terrific. Binoche won a supporting actress Oscar for it and deservingly so as really the heart of the film that connects the present to the past. Fiennes and Thomas have great chemistry in their relationship that builds itself piece by piece. Some complain this film is boring. Well it's builds itself slowly, but I have never found it boring. The relationships are fascinating and it takes the viewer from place to place with a superb beauty and detail in just about every shot. Seriously I doubt there's a bad shot in the entire film. The film could have trimmed itself down some, shortening or eliminating ascene or two, but honestly I don't have a problem with its length at all. I don't rank this film with the like of Lawrence of Arabia or Gone with the Wind, but it certainly stands as one of the great modern film epics. A must see for anyone who can appreciate a top quality art film.     The DVD is a 2 disk set, and the second disk has some fascination special features involving the making of the film, the film makers and cast, and the author of the book The English Patient. There are also some deleted scenes I found particularly fascinating. I haven't yet viewed the commentary, but look forward to it. The director, Anthony Minghella, died just March this year at the age of just 54. It was a great loss to film making (he also directed Cold Mountain and Truly Madly Deeply among other films). We lost a great film maker, and I dedicate this review in his behalf.

1400032717|5.0|This book transports you into the mindset of a very different young teenage boy and chronicles his reaction to a whole set of slightly exaggerated, droll, and not entirely unbelievable circumstances--among them the murder of a dog, his mother's illicit affair, the breakup of his parent's marriage, the very much challenged father, the fight over custody--all in a distinctly English working class setting.    Some reviewers have insisted that the author, in the guise of the boy as narrator/protagonist, would appear to minimize or otherwise distort the burden of Asperger's syndrome (as the book jacket describes his condition) or, perhaps more accurately, autism.  That may well be the case.  Perhaps, for example, it would be exceedingly rare for someone in this boy's condition to be so mathematically gifted or inclined.  But this is fiction, afterall, and not a medical journal.    The book is wonderfully written, original, and very moving in its exploration of the nature of family and human relationships.  I heartily recommend the book and most especially its reader in the audio version.
B0017XOF5A|5.0|If you have ever enjoyed a single movie or episode of Stargate you will love this. Like everything Stargate you need to at least be familiar with the basic premise of the TV show to grasp it. That said, even if you haven't seen an episode in close to 9 years you will understand it enough to know you are in for a treat. It is dramatic, funny, and most of all a fun ride. My only complaint is its length. The 98 minutes goes by all too fast. I'd have been happy with another 10minutes, and ecstatic with an extra 20 to fully soak in the characters and story. Make no mistake in what time there is has been used well, but a few climactic scenes could have been lengthened a bit to stress the true direness of the situation.<br /><br />The BD transfer is overall very good especially many of the arctic scenes. There was no doubt on those it was all on location. There are a few shots interspersed that look as if came from a standard definition stock most notable a couple of the airplane shots. The rest of the footage is standard fare for a BD transfer. The arctic shots truly are what sets the BD above and beyond the DVD copy. I just wish there was a digital copy included is my only real gripe.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|Great show, very well filmed, sound is fantastic. I like the 3 set thing John does. However i was hoping for better bonus footage.  This is a great show for any Mayer fan you get it all, the Room for Squares era, the blues Trio and new stuff.  He keeps gettin better and better. Dont need to like him as a person to enjoy this
0316010669|4.0|The Book on the Nightstand - July 08    The book falling off the nightstand this month is [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]]. The take-away from this text is why and how we make snap decisions, and to what degree these decisions should be trusted. I walked away with a solid understanding of the why and how, but less so on the trust and accuracy of snap decisions. Statistically you should go with your first \\"gut decision\\", except when you shouldn't. The text left me feeling vague in that area.    [[ASIN:1581154887 The Art of Digital Branding]] contrasts the Margaret Thatcher quote \\"I make my mind up about someone within the first ten seconds and I very seldom change it\\" with the research of psychologist Alexander Todorov, that \\"most people actually make a judgment about someone based on his facial appearance within one-tenth of a second\\", (page 27).    How is this used in design? A study by the Human-Oriented Technology Lab at Carleton University shows that \\"people can make an instinctive decision as to whether a web site is good or bad in 1/20th of a second\\", (page 34). An on-line consumer has made a decision to purchase within the first 40 seconds of entering a web site.    The design and balance of the first or home page of a site is critical, one of the primary metrics of Google Analytics is the \\"bounce rate\\". Bounce Rate is the percentage of single-page visits (i.e. visits in which the person left your site from the entrance page). Bounce Rate is a measure of visit quality and a high Bounce Rate generally indicates that site entrance (landing) pages aren't relevant to your visitors. A high bounce rate from the main page reflects that people fled your site after a fraction of a second that your material was unsuitable for them. Like the Prime Minister, they probably won't be back.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Awesome Riffs, Headbanging chugging rhythm, Chucks incredible vocals, Alex's \\"electrifying\\" playing..what else could you ask for. One of the best albums of 2008! If you love old school thrash metal...get it!
B00139B39E|2.0|How could this be DT's best album without Metropolis? It just doesn't make sense. It'd have been even worth eliminating a couple of songs for. I know they couldn't put everything particularly epics like \\"A change of seasons\\" and \\"Octavarium\\". AS a DT fan, I can even live without \\"Lines in the sand\\" and \\"Blind faith\\" on this, but Metropolis...     The best albums are for non-fans. They must get the right idea about the bands from them. The song represents what DT is about. To anybody who doesn't know DT, the very first song I'll play is Metropolis(I have!). People can get the right idea about the band from that song. I'm quite sure DT fans out there agree with me on this. (I can't believe MP missed this one. He is one of few musicians out there who really listens to the fans.)     And what the hell is \\"Misunderstood\\" doing on disc 1?
B0010358EE|5.0|Wonderful! the animation and graphics are absolutely brilliant, and the characters and plot are magnificent!
B00139W3NE|2.0|.....Amazing how they managed to completely miss the point of the book.  They took all the action from the book, but left out the important information that supports the action.  The movie briefly mentions Dust at the beginning...and never goes anywhere with that idea.  Never mentions anything about the religious beliefs behind Dust and its connection to children and their Daemons.  I personally dont see how they can make the 2nd film....because thats what it most deals with...(atleast as far as I have read into it so far.)     The movie as a movie was well made....as a book to movie adaptation it is horrible.  Read the book first, then see the movie! The book is WAY better.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|Man this show rocks!!! James Woods is freakin funny at times and brilliant at others. The story will keep you coming back for more and there are plenty of little plot twists that will surprise you when you least expect it. I started watching this by myself but by the time i was at the end of the season...there was like 3 to 4 other people in my room every night watching it with me...it's a great show!!!

B0013J9KOO|4.0|The government has a bunch of freaks working for it in New Jersey.  They consist of Hellboy (Pearlman), a large devil-like being who is a wise-guy; Liz (Blair), Hellboy's girlfriend who has the ability to create flames around her; Abe Sapien (Jones), an amphibian; and Johann Kraus (Dunn), a gas creature stuffed into a human shaped suit.  They need to stop Prince Nuada (Gross), who wishes to control the Golden Army, indestructible warriors who he can use to wage war against humanity.  Nuada's twin sister Nuala (Walton) is opposed to him, and steals a piece of the controlling crown and flees to Hellboy and his friends for protection.  She might not be a safe as she thinks, as Nuada seeks her out with a vengeance.    \\"Hellboy II', like its predecessor, is a strange superhero/fantasy hybrid.  That and its quirky characters make this a different moviegoing experience, and raise it above a standard.  Also the direction by Guillermo del Toro is top notch.  He has fantasy films down pat, and is able to bring all the mythical creatures to life with ease.  The acting is good too.  All the principals make the characters their own, much like they did in the first film.  They all seem to be enjoying themselves, and that translates well to the characters in the film.  Story-wise, there are some big plot holes, but the journey is fun enough to make you not think about them.  \\"Hellboy II\\" is well worth seeing, and I am sure we will be seeing more of Hellboy and friends in the years to come.
B000002KKS|5.0|By 1980 Sabbath's situation appeared hopeless. The Prince of Darkness was now off the helm of the mic, and finding a replacement to match such a large personality would be diffucult. However, the satanic ones made a great choice when they recruited ex-rainbow singer Ronnie James Dio (Rainbow's first 3 efforts are nearly as brilliant as this btw esp. rising). They found a singer that not only could convey the dark majestic tone synonymous with Sabbath but could also sing. Dio unabashadely mixes opera and a metal scream and subsequently possesses arguably the finest voice in metal. It's also at this point that Iommi and ward finally speeds up some of tempos from dreary sludgy riffs ala \\"Sweet Leaf\\" to rockers like \\"Neon Knights\\".     Right from the start its apparent that Dio and Sabbath work together on the driving Neon Knights. But Dio's ability to carry a tune not only helps on the hard fast metal songs but also allows the sabs to finally successfully add subetly into their music. Tracks like Children of the Sea and Die Young brilliantly intermix beautiful singing, subtle melody with driving metallic power. And nowhere else is this realized better than on the gothic title track where Dio gives the most memorable performance of his entire career. The track led initially by Dio's beautiful singing is led slowly by Iommi and Butler into gothic rocking mayhem before descending once again into Neo-classical Bliss. Brilliant.    The Best Sabbath Album period. The songwriting is the most mature, the guitar solos burn, and this may be one of the few metal albums with GREAT VOCALS. Sure I love old Sabbath, but any sabbath, Dio, rainbow, or hell any hard/rock metal fan check this out. Its a severely underrated masterpiece.
B000002572|5.0|There are many good reviews for this records: take a look for yourself, 260 good ones to about 20 bad ones. As far as the bad ones go, you never what style of music they like; they may not listen to rock at all, but be Hip Hop or Classical enthusiasts. It is just so wrong to say that Boston is cliche and uninteresting. First of all, the fact that people still listen to this music 30 years later means a lot; many bands don't even live past 5 years (look at all the pop, hip-hop, and so called \\"rock\\" bands that play on mtv and on the radio). Boston has one of the most interesting music ever played. It is complex, melodic, harmonic, and beautiful. Just compare the guitar tabs with for example \\"Boys like girls\\" music. Boston's music is very difficult to play, while this so called modern rock boys like girls is simple and repetitive. In fact, this is the only album I have listened to that I like every song on the album. It is true that the future quality of the music has declined, but for people who say that Boston is short lived and not dynamic, I disagree once more. If you listen to Corporate America, none of the songs have the bright feeling of their first album. Not to say it is worse, it is just different. \\"I had a good time\\" is their best \\"new\\" Boston song, which is equally as worth buying as this album. There is also no way someone can see Brad Delp is bad. His voice is like Freddie Mercury's. It is powerful and impossible to immitate. Besides that, who else invented his own recording equipment? (I am talking about Tom Scholz). This band is a must for every  Classic Rock listener. There is no possible way a person who likes music like The Eagles, Queen, Pink FLoyd, Led Zeppelin, or The Police can say that this does not belong in a classic rock collection.  And yes I live in New York, and no, I am not a Red Sox fan.

B0010YPTGU|5.0|I try to avoid watching concerts for the fear of being distracted from the music by lights, fashion, and fake dramatics. Watching Bocelli's concert definitely changed my mind about television viewing of concerts.<br /><br />It's hard to select the best song, but the great performance of \\"CANTO DELLA TERRA\\" with Sarah Brightman, \\"VIVERE\\" with Laura Pausini and \\"LA VOCE DEL SILENZIO\\" with Elisa surely stand out, so much so that they became my favorite night lullabys.  Maybe it's only me, but I couldn't help noticing that Brightman and Bocelli are old friends that very much enjoy working together. Also, while watching VIVERE, I just couldn't help but noticing how Bocelli's face lit up when hearing Pausini's voice, a great performance that looked to me like love making in highest form.<br /><br />Only a musical giant like Bocelli can be humble enough to get that number of talents to share the spotlight in his concert like Kenny G, Heather Headley, Chris Botti, and Lang Lang. Elisa and Lang Lang  were given the opportunity of using Bocelli's stage to perform their own works, which added more to the glorious concert and just reinforced my view of Andrea Bocelli's humility and generosity.<br /><br />Discovering talents like Lang Lang and Elisa in this concert is a great pleasure to add to the enjoyment of experiencing Bocelli's \\"Live in Tuscany\\" enchanted night.
0143113100|5.0|This book goes thru new findings on brain plasticity--read the other reviews for details on chapters. It is a great book for laypersons wanting to understand the new neuroplasticity theories and how the brain can re-wire itself, heal itself, and improve with 'brain exercise'. That our brains ARE capable of GREAT changes even after trauma, stroke, or aging have changed them for the worse. It bogs down in places. There are chapters on neurosis, sexual habits, personality 'dark sides', mental illness, stroke, positive thinking...and how this new format for the brain \\"re-wires\\" people wanting to CHANGE something formerly thought PERMANENT and unchangable. It is NOT an infomercial as some reviewers have stated, as they donated a program (Posit Science brain rehab programs) to this Wounded Warrior from the US Army who has a brain injury from Iraq...so I could rehab. It is being used by many soldiers with brain injury and they are enjoying it, and seeing changes. We are all still applying it--so the outcome is anyone's guess. BUT W/O THIS BOOK, WE WOULD HAVE NEVER KNOWN ABOUT THESE PROGRAMS. Buy it! 1/4 of the book is references and notes--all good sources for websites and more data.
0452289963|5.0|This is NOT a book about the earth's environment per se.  It takes us back to our origin--our purpose in life when we awaken to it, to a spiritual basis of humility and oneness.  To Consciousness.  Tolle has a very logical way at arriving at this basis and one which we need NOW,  because the consciousness of most humans of today is in crisis.

1592642195|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a very long time! From the moment I picked it up and read the first page I was hooked, as the characters are so real and loveable and the descriptions are so vivid and full of life, it is impossible to put down. The author has painted a picture of life in Ireland which at times is very moving, but it is done  with such humour and remarkable attention to detail it is certainly a story that will stay with the reader for a long time. Don't miss a wonderful book.

0743454537|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book. It immediately drew me in. The topic is very interesting and thought provoking, no doubt. I read it quickly because I was very eager to find out what happened. However, the characters aren't incredibly likeable. They took turns narrating chapters, which is a nice format. But the thought processes of each character were very similar and almost too constantly \\"deep\\" and soap-opera-ish. I don't believe that an 11-year-old is as profound as a fifty-year-old mother and similar to an teenage male misfit. It was almost constantly too intense, if that makes any sense. The book is not bad, as I said, it's interesting. Everyone has mixed feelings about the ending and I thought it was just an okay one. This is the first book I've ever read by Picoult. Because I was so torn on my feelings for this one, I'll have to check out a few others before forming my opinion on her as an author.
1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is Khaled Hossini's best work to date.  While the Kite Runner is ground breaking, this book is the one book everyone should read to understand what has been happening in Afganistan.  After you read it, you will never be the same, will never think the same, and will be eternally grateful for the many blessing you have in the US or Europe.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|While this show isn't James Cameron calibur stuff, for television it is really well done with some nice acting and top notch visual effects. I was never a T3 hater, but after watching the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, I prefer this storyline and will happily ignore everything in T3 (at least until the fourth movie comes out in 2009).<br /><br />Lena Headey makes a good Sarah Connor, but the real star is Summer Glau, of Firefly and Serenity fame, who plays the cyborg protector named Cameron. She is cute, funny when trying not to be, and downright deadly when in combat. Not to mention the fact that this series shows off Brian Austin Green's acting skill and succeeds. What did I just say?<br /><br />If your a fan of the movies, you will find much to enjoy here. It isn't up to par with shows like LOST or 24 just yet, but who knows what the future will hold?
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Worth checking out.  A good new talent and she mixes up some styles that I found attractive.
6305313687|4.0|American History X is a powerful film about a controversial and disturbing subject: racism in America. Edward Norton plays the part of Derek Vinyard, who is an intelligent young man who falls into the skinhead neo Nazi lifestyle in Venice Beach, California. Stacey Keach plays Cameron Alexander, a white supremacist based on Tom Metzger, and Avery Brooks plays Dr. Bob Sweeney, a black high school teacher who reaches out to his students, both Black and White, to try to get them to turn away from gangs, hatred, and violence.<br /><br />Edward Furlong plays Daniel Vinyard, the younger brother of Derek, who also gets involved in the neo Nazi skinhead lifestyle once his brother Derek is sent to prison. Derek shoots and murders some Black car jackers who are stealing his truck, but goes over the line in his zealotry, and is sent to prison. While in prison, he rejects racism, and when he gets out, he tries to prevent his younger brother Danny from making the same mistakes as he. But it is not that easy, it is not like a Country Club that you can just quit and walk away from.<br /><br />Finally, director Tony Kaye wanted his name removed and sued the film company for damages. Edward Norton edited the film, and gave himself a bigger role, according to Kaye, and they fell out over artistic differences. I think that the final product was very good, and I don't see why Tony Kaye didn't want to be associated with it. The film I saw was well directed and covered a very controversial subject remarkably well. I guess it is just that the subject creates very strong feelings, and it is difficult to come to an agreement about how best to convey the proper politically correct line. It was almost one of those \\"directed by Alan Smithee' situations, but one of the stipulations of using that pseudonym is that you don't discuss your dissatisfaction with the project in public, and Tony Kaye had already taken out ads in Variety that aired his dirty laundry and complaints.<br /><br />FILMS AND ROLES OF EDWARD NORTON<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005JLPK Frida]] (2002) ....

0060899220|5.0|Food service is difficult work.  You're on you feet in continual motion for hours.  Your brain is constantly assembling, re-assembling and deleting detailed orders.  It's HOT in the kitchen.  Can you trust some of the people carrying knives?  Your days off, or shall we say your hours off, are opposite to any friend or relative outside the business.  Evenings, weekends and holidays are spent with your kitchen staff family. Given the working conditions and the low wages, there are lots of personal problems in this kitchen family of yours.<br /><br />Tony didn't mention the mixed food and grease smell in your hair and fingernails you seem to acquire by quitting time.<br /><br />The Food Channel makes it look so effortless.  The Food Channel makes it look wholesome.  As they plate up the food, be it in the studio kitchen, the time pressured Kitchen Stadium or on the road, there's a lot you don't see.  You don't see how the food gets there or how the dishes are washed. Who fills those ramiken dishes?  You never see the crew behind the successful chefs be they in your local X star restaurant or on TV.<br /><br />I spent 7 years in the restaurant business and from that experience, Tony is spot on!  Not is he just right on the staff, the owners and managers I met/worked with, all outside of NYC, fit within the molds he presents.<br /><br />The book is not only funny and fun, but also gives good advice to anyone interested in working in food service in any capacity.

B000EOTAM6|1.0|As one esteemed critic so aptly put it, \\"Fux fux sux fux sux sux sux\\".<br /><br />The animated series that appeared on Liquid Television was cool, especially for it's time. Liquid Television was a good show bringing viewers highly original and entertaining animation. As for the movie, in my opinion they completely blew it. Charlize Theron is talented but wasn't at all right for the part. I thought Carrie-Anne Moss would have been better. The movie wasn't at all like the TV show. The creator of Aeon Flux said upon seeing the movie he \\"felt helpless, humiliated and sad\\". They should have stayed true to the TV series and Peter Chung should have had creative input.

B000FGGE68|1.0|Terrible. Just another low budget CGI Hollywood action flick crap fest. Only saw the first 1/3 of this junk but that was more than enough. Zero stars.

It helps you understand the Founding Fathers in a new way - as people going through life with its up's and down's just like us.  It gives new insight into some of the behind the scenes issues that you never learned in history class!  The 5th session is a little slow and a little harder to understand, but not enough to make you stop viewing it.    We bought it not only for our own use, but also to help our grandchildren understand our historical foundations in a deeper way.      We would highly recommend it!
0141439661|5.0|Jane Austen's comforting classic is based on the dichotomous relationship between reason (Elinor) and emotion (Marianne). Austen's greatness lies in her backing out of the box of 19th-century literary moralism and seeing the areas of gray in human relationships and within the individual. Over and over again in this \\"early\\" work (Austen was only 41 when she died) we see characters acting in unexpected ways, even while social strictures are so much in evidence. The most outstanding characters are those who go against the social grain, and Austen unfailingly creates classic foils against whom these interesting individuals can stand out. Entertaining, existing in a stable social world, clever, and funny, this novel is like \\"comfort food.\\" If you're in the mood for a diverting stroll into another century, let this book be your guide. I also highly recommend the Penguin Classic that has an introductory section by Tony Tanner (if you can find it). Tony Tanner's brilliant insights into Austen and this work deeply enriched it for me. But this section must be read after you read the book.

When one of them starts making nasty comments toward Beth which prompts Bernie and Danny to react, she decides to try get them out of there as quickly as possible.  One of them, Spencer Craig, follows them out and starts a fight as Beth is trying to grab a cab.  What happens next is a turning point that changes their lives forever.  Danny is sentenced to 22 years in prison for he would rather go to prison as an innocent man, than agree to a plea that would be admitting to a crime, he did not commit.  The power of four, all for one and one for all,  maybe strong, but it does not stand up to the power of revenge.<br /><br />The master story teller takes you through a suspenseful rollercoaster ride of twists and turns which keeps you riveted till the end.  I chose this book because I had recently read \\"Kane and Abel\\" and absolutely loved it.  I was just as impressed with this one.
0743454537|4.0|I'm very angry with Jodi Picoult.  She was in complete control of the lives of the characters of this book.  I have to wonder why she chose to end this book the way she did. I have to give the book high ratings due to the skill of the author. All along, I was tempted to peek at the ending, which I've been guilty of a time or two.  This time, for some unknown reason, I resisted.  I wish I had peeked now, because it would have saved me a few sleepless nights trying to finish the book.      I'll say this, for the author, she knows how to hold my attention.  There were a lot of thought-provoking topics covered.  I like the way we can get inside of the minds of all of the main characters. So much so, that I almost felt their pain.    For the sake of you who have purchased or plan on purchasing this book, don't peek at the end.  You may not want to finish the book if you do.
B000WC3A0S|4.0|This is first time I've watched the entire series from start to finish uninterrupted.  The picture and sound looks fine.  For the original five, there's no commentary or special features except for the trailers.  This was very surprising.  The last \\"Rocky Balboa\\" comes with commentary and features.  Hard to explain why the first five was ignored.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|One is immediately drawn to the thrilling premise based on the eponymous [[ASIN:0765357690 Stephen Gould novel]] (with liberal dilutions to the story) about a young lad named David who can teleport himself. One then sees the star-studded crew behind this caper and is almost certain to savor it: the director of The Bourne Identity, and script writers of Fight Club, Batman Begins and Mr. and Mrs. Smith.<br /><br />Yet, despite all that they ought to have had going for themselves, somehow these cooks managed to make a stunning scattershot mess of this sci-fi broth. They decided, I suppose, that a movie named Jumper would do well with a jumpy screenplay.  Why trouble yourself with exploring the socio-psychological ramifications of teleportation or some such meaningful effort, when you can opt for a wannabe-epic adventure targeted at the nose-pierced crowd?<br /><br />Landscapes switch at 60,000 frames per second. Our hero has lunch in Rome only to digest it all while surfing in Fiji. You know how it works. The teleporting bits are fine, but how a puny little teenager who was chronically ragged by bullies at school learned to do all the funky stuff at will, goes a trifle unexplained.<br /><br />Soon enough, our supra-hero discovers that his abilities have landed him in the persecuted half of an old historic war. Sigh. On one side are his band of teleporting buddies called Jumpers -- all mysteriously young and fit, one quite thoughtfully a British (where were the token black and Chinese buddies?). On the other side are efficient \\"Paladins\\" organized to demolish them. The chief Paladin is a self-same Samuel Jackson sporting a silver crew-cut.<br /><br />Now, for some uncommon reason, David has a nice revealing collection of photographs at home. Snapshots of *all* the places in the world to which he \\"jumps\\". Which naturally aids our chief Paladin's search. But not before a romantic angle is tossed in as David takes his high-school girlfriend out to Rome for a swing -- they fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.<br /><br />The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through. Christensen, an actor chosen clearly to appeal to the younger Star Wars fans, would have done well to consider a repertoire of at least two facial expressions. The final 15 minutes or so have so much rammed into them, with pulse-pounding heavy metal music of course, that one wonders if the film was about to overrun its deadline and had to be chip-chopped in a rush.<br /><br />The loud hints at the end suggest that there might be a Jumper II. Optimistic as that may be, one hopes they will rope in someone else to write, direct, act in, and score it. The theme and Stephen Gould surely deserve better.fly regular Northwest of course, despite the hunt on for his arrest at NSA level.<br /><br />The plot holes are large enough for obese teleporters to jump through.

B0017ZB8M6|5.0|This Cd is great for the summer totally something that I would't normally buy but(loved the I kissed a girl song!!!)  and liked most of the songs if you like madonna you will like Katy!!!
B000FA57NK|4.0|I purchased this movie because I felt that the HD would do it justice.  After watching it, I was not overly impressed with the HD quality.  Only some of the scenes seemed sharper than the standard DVD.  I am still happy with the movie and glad that I got it.
B0002NRQTI|5.0|When I purchased this album the first day of its release, I could tell they were moving in a different direction; boy was I ever right!! Counter parts is deffinitly their best album of the 90's. From the opening track Counterparts, this album takes on a journey back when they had that guitar sound of the 70's. Alex lifeson with some great guitar work on Cut to the Chase, Stick it Out,and the best song Cold Fire to Neal's great writing with songs like Nobody's Hero, which is a tear jerker to Animate, and Cold fire are some of the best lyrics I have ever seen and heard in a song, along with his drum playing and of course and Geddy Lee's bass with hardly any keyboards, is a breath of fresh air. His singing is also0 great on this record. This is a must for Rush fans of all generations. It is a sleeper and under appreciated.
B000GY729M|5.0|Where do I start. First off this is a good CD and a great selection of songs from the Killers. Personally I just love the Killers and the more I listen to this CD the more they become my favorite band. You just have to give this a listen and you'll feel the same way.
B000P0J05G|5.0|My wife and I originally saw this movie in the theater.  I laughed so hard throughout the movie that I missed a lot of it.  So, I bought the vhs tape and wore it out.  Then when DVD came out, I bought it and have watched it at least a dozen times.  Now I have the HD and I am glad I do.  The special effects seem if nothing else, worse on the HD version because of the high detail, but that just adds to the character of it.  Just can't get tired of this movie.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I will admit that I don't usually buy cd's with live content and this purchase was actually an accident.  I simply saw that the cd was John Mayer's and I bought it, not realizing it was a live performance.  However, I turned out not to be disappointed at all.  This cd is great and Mayer proves that he is one of the best guitarists in recent memory.  My favorites from the performance, \\"Gravity\\" and \\"Good Love Is On the Way,\\" show Mayer's skill and range of musical ability to mix smooth, bluesy ballads with stirring fast-paced songs.  I loved this cd from beginning to end and I'm sure that every other John Mayer fan will too.
B0007YN76S|5.0|This was the 1st book of the one of the best series I've ever read! I couldn't put it down. She's so ridiculous with her spending you just want to smack her. Such a great read! I even got my friends hooked on it!
0143038419|3.0|I enjoyed reading this novel and ironically began reading it on a flight to Italy. The book dragged a bit in the middle section for me and I felt that at times the author could be a bit self centered. However, I think the purpose of the novel was to tell the story of the author finding herself and naturally parts of the novel are bound to be self centered as the book is focusing on herself! This was just one woman's exceptional self discovery that she decided to put down in print and I believe that many people go on journeys of self exploration. People discover themselves in different manners and I do not feel that its fair to judge the author based on the manner in which she discovered herself. I think readers need to keep in mind that this is one story told by the author about the author. The book is decently entertaining and I particularly liked the section about Italy. I recommend this as a summer reading book but I wouldn't describe this novel as life changing.
1433203316|1.0|This story neither gathered my attention, and I like to read about vampires, nor did the middle or ending do anything for my sensiblities for a horror story.  Awful. just awful.  Sorry, Matheson.
1594489505|5.0|After reading Kite Runner (highly recommend) I sought out A Thousand Splendid Suns. There is something about Khaled Hosseini's writing that is so addictive, so inspiring, so touching that you can't help but feel compassion for the young children in his stories. In Kite Runner we were introduced to two young boys, in A Thousand Splendid Suns we meet a young Afghan girl. Both stories are filled with hardship, with turmoil, with events that only allow us to glimpse the horrors of growing up in a war-torn part of the world. A must read!! Also, if you missed reading Khaled Hosseini's A Thousand Splendid Suns, go and read it. [[ASIN:1400076943 Purple Hibiscus: A Novel]] It's so addictive. There is something about his books that bring you in and get you hooked. and I'm loving this one. Highly Recommend!
B00005R62K|5.0|This is my favorite 70's Priest album! Theres not a lot of well known song's here, but the whole album is full of great tunes! It also features my favorite priest song EVER! You definitly want to get the remastered editions. I HAD to upgrade all of mine- the sound is a million times better! I could live without the bonus tracks though. Heres a track by track review:    1- Exciter. Maybe the most popular track on the CD. Great song, but I like at least half of the songs here better. The drum intro is amazing!    2- White Heat, Red Hot. I've heard some knocks here on this song, but I think it may be my 2nd favorite song on the CD. I LOVE the chorus!     3- Better by you, Better than me. A remake. Never heard the original, but this is a great song. Sometimes when I listen to it, I have an urge to \\"do it!\\". Do what? I dont know!!! (Sorry! Bad joke!)    4- Stained Class. I don't know how Rob Halford keeps up the high notes like this through out the song! Another great song with a great chorus!    5- Invader. Ehh, ok song. Probably my least favorite. Catchy, but kinda poppy chorus    6- Saints in Hell. Great song that gets better as it goes along. I love the way Rob keeps changing the way he sings the line \\"Saints in Hell\\". Very heavy & moody song!    7- Savage. Not bad, but pales in comparison to most of the other songs.    8- Beyond the Realms of Death. This is the crown jewel in the Priest catalouge! Perfect from beginning to end! Perfect vocals, lyrics, music, solos- you name it! Just an amazing song. Powerful & emotional ! This CD is worth buying for this track alone!    9- Heros End. Great ending to a great CD!     You'll only find two songs from this CD on Essential Priest, but don't let that fool you. This is a killer album from start to finish. Very heavy, yet melodic. Even the 2 songs I didn't give rave reviews for seem to be favorites of other reviewers here, so don't take my word for it- just buy this album! You won't be dissapointed!
B0012Q732O|3.0|Nothing earth shaking about this one. Just a plain old ... movie.<br />Something to pass time.
B00005K9LN|5.0|Judas Priest is my 2nd favorite band, and this is my favorite release of theirs. Don't listen to people who say this album is a sell out! Sure, Breaking the Law, Living after Midnite & United have commercial appeal, but the former two are two of their best songs. And can anyone honestly tell me that ANY of the other songs on this album are radio friendly? Rapid Fire? Grinder? Metal Gods? These songs are pure metal Heaven! The Rage is the closest thing to a ballad, and it still rocks!  And I'm sorry, but after 4 studio LP's that didn't exactly light the world on fire (sales wise), can you blame them for wanting to record some material that might gain them some attention? Did it ever occur to anyone that maybe the record company may have given up on the band if they didn't have a breakout hit? Quit griping! This album kicks from beginning to end! It's not a coincidence that this ablum was picked for VH1's classic albums series, and anyone on the fence for buying this should check out that show!
B00005JPY0|5.0|Of course, I'm being provocative (again).  The title of this review implies that I didn't enjoy \\"Dark Knight\\" which is not at all true.  However, there are so many glowing endorsements of this film here at amazon.com that I decided the only way I could possibly add anything that would help the 12 people who haven't yet seen this, would be to temper their expectations by pointing out some areas I had trouble with.  In this way, they may enjoy the film without wasting thought on the details that bugged me.  I'll still indulge myself by reinforcing some of the things that are undeniably cool about \\"Dark Knight\\" but my goal is to prepare you to enjoy it despite its problems.<br /><br />-GOTHAM POLICE FORCE; WORST EVER.<br />Be prepared for police ineptitude on the grandest of scales.  Ironically, it's not the difficult detective work or the ability to run an efficient bust they have problems with.  It's the stuff that goes on right under their noses that boggles the mind.  Explosives in huge quantities and in improbable places get moved around this city without suspicion.  The Gotham Police criminal handling protocol would delight any felon with aspirations of escape.  Also apparent is the complete lack of an internal affairs department or any oversights at all for that matter.  Be ready to suspend logic for these aspects or you might be disappointed.<br /><br />-THE JOKER; MOUTH-READY MAYHEM!!<br />Be prepared for some twisted yet improbable conundrums from the Joker.  Remember those explosive I told you about?  Well, never is it explained or eluded to how so much volatile material gets moved through the city so quickly and unnoticed (police ineptitude not withstanding).  Never mind the cost of the explosive extravagance; I just wondered how The Joker got such elaborate plans to work without any disruption.  As elaborate as the plans were, they were always mouth-ready and waiting to be deployed as the need arose.  Obviously, you have to give him credit as a criminal genius.  But I think the grand scale of his plans would be more palatable if some sense of time were introduced into the story; it seems like it all takes place by magic instead of grand planning.  Some plans are so grand that they raised serious questions of plausibility.<br /><br />-O.A.D.; OBSCURE ACTION DISORDER<br />Like \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"Dark Knight\\" suffers from OAD.  If you need your action to appear discernable from its surroundings or you need to understand how a fight took place, this film will not completely satisfy you.  Luckily, the fight scenes were almost reduced to tools for moving the plot instead of showpieces in themselves.  However, some were staged as set pieces and were less than stellar.  With flashing lights, way too close, always in the dark, obscure action, you will never know exactly how Batman defeated his foes.  Admittedly, this is a pet peeve of mine for any film.  Yet, it was a minor inconvenience when you look at the picture as a whole.<br /><br />-THE SCARY THING IS IT COULD HAVE BEEN LONGER. (mild spoilers)<br />About an hour and a half into the film, the Joker is in jail along with most of the other bad guys.  The problem is we have another hour to go.  At this point the film started to feel long.  When you think about my complaints and what it would take to fix them, we're talking about a 4 hour movie.  As complete and compelling as the story is, could it have been 2 films?  I'm pushing it here, but it might have been 2 great films instead of one really good film.<br /><br />-FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH; HEATH LEDGER DESERVES AN OSCAR BID.<br />I'm just chiming in on this point.  You've probably read the same thing a dozen times by now.  I don't believe winning an Oscar is always indicative of great work; sometimes it's more of a legacy award.  In cases of death, sometimes the Oscar is a sympathy award given posthumously.  In this case he earned it.  In fact, I would argue that he threw himself so completely into this psychotic role that it contributed to his demise.  Ironically, this role will define his career.<br /><br />-REINFORCING THE GOOD<br />Besides Heath Ledger, the one thing that makes this film so compelling is the story.  It is complex but not intellectual.  It questions our humanity without preaching.  Most importantly, it explores our willingness to comply with the corrupt status quo.  \\"Dark Night\\" depicts so clearly how jarring it would be to actually uproot corruption from our everyday existence to the point that we may not ever want it to happen; talk about ironic.<br /> Despite the cinematic proliferation of computer graphics, the visual effects are so convincing that you are left questioning \\"how did they do that?\\"  Can you remember the last time you said that?  The car stunts are unique and entertaining while all of the actors pull more than their weight.  In fact, if I didn't complain about it, it was well done.<br /><br />-VIGILANTE VERDICT<br />This is by far my favorite Batman film.  I purposely raised a lot of complaints and criticisms to the point of stretching the limits.  My goal was to temper your enthusiasm so you will lower your expectations for \\"Dark Knight\\".  If I succeed in this, you will probably have even more fun than I did watching the best \\"Bat\\" movie ever.<br /><br />Story......6 stars<br />Action.....3.5 stars<br />Acting.....5.5 stars<br />Questions.3.5 stars<br />Visuals....5.5 stars  Total....4.8 starsdefine his career.    -REINFORCING THE GOOD  Besides Heath Ledger, the one thing that makes this film so compelling is the story.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Truly the best new show of last season, unapologetic in its psychology and conviction.  Everyone is comparing it to SOPRANOS for the obvious reasons, but to me it is much deeper than that great show.  It is really about what we (America) became after WWII and it explains a lot of who we are now.  Match it up with movies like SWEET SMELL OF SUCCESS, THE APARTMENT, and QUIZ SHOW and we're starting to detect a pattern here.  A smoky, sexist, lavish, and ultimately, empty one.  Naughtily executed.
B000J10EQU|2.0|Frist thing is first Lex Luthor is back yet again after I don't know how many defaets by Superman. Will Lex ever give up.  I don't understand why Superman doesn't jut break Lex's back so he can never walk again or put him into a coma so he can't come up with another evil plan. Also there is a catch there is a superboy in this one who kills a henchman with a piano but can't break out of a pantry.  Did i mention the boy threw the piano at the henchman.  Anyway Kevin Spacey does a good job as Lex.  Lois Lane is her same old self like in all the rest of the movies.  Why can't Superman get a villain who he can actually fight.  Kitty Lex's clueless henchgirl pulls off her role.  Brandon Routh as Superman I like.  The movie is to dramatic though.  Barely any action but good effects.  So it was a movie I can watch when there are no other choices.  Yeah, it is that bad.
0345494768|5.0|It's high time.  Nicely edited, lots of detail.  Basically I am flashing back to my childhood every time I open this book.  It is not a casual read as it weighs a gazillion pounds and the print is small.  Don't change a thing!  Thanks for finally recording this history in a quality fashion.  EMPIRE STRIKES BACK may be the cinematic masterpiece but this film was what defined all major studio decisions since, and it is charming, exciting, and inspiring simultaneously.  Ironic since Fox never were behind this film in the first place (Holla, Alan Ladd, for believing).
B00005JPY0|5.0|In the weeks leading up to its release, The Dark Knight quickly became one of the most anticipated movies of my lifetime, rivaled only by the Lord of the Rings movies. I was quite impressed by Batman Begins, a dark, imaginative reshaping of the Batman franchise after it shot itself in the foot with Batman and Robin, one of those proverbial \\"so bad, it's good\\" films. But this movie was much better than Batman Begins. It's an unbelievably good movie. It's more than just a superhero movie: it's a crime drama that gives us a good, hard look at the human psyche.<br />First and foremost, the late Heath Ledger's last completed performance as the Joker must be  praised. His Joker describes himself as \\"an agent of chaos\\" and \\"a dog chasing cars [who] wouldn't know what to do with one if [he] caught it.\\" He has no code of chivalry, no ideals, no goal. He just destroys for the sake of destroying, with little regard for his own safety and none at all for anyone else's. In fact, he goes as far as dubbing an event that could result in the death of hundreds a \\"social experiment.\\" I will never look at a pencil the same way after seeing this film. If you've witnessed the Joker's \\"magic trick,\\" you'll know what I mean. This general sense of insanity makes him a dangerous villain...<br />...and a good opponent for Batman. Christian Bale takes up the Batsuit once more, and he's back in the tortured pathos of the classic role. The Joker really helps exploit Batman's darker side. The central conflict here is in Batman's head - should he abandon his code and do away with the Joker, or is he truly incorruptible? Or will he not kill Joker for a second, more obvious reason: does Batman feel that Joker completes him, the way Joker feels about Batman? That's the point of the movie. Balance. Good and evil can never defeat each other, for one cannot truly exist without the other.<br />Enough philosophizing, though. There's more to praise about this film. Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart) deserves praise as Gotham City's White Knight. But when a horrible accident occurs, Harvey changes. In another exploration of the darker corners of our minds, the film reveals just what lengths some people will go to bring wrongdoers to justice. Eckhart's transition to Two-Face, and his subsequent conversation with Joker, is one of the many highlights of a spectacular movie.<br />Alfred (Michael Caine) and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) are excellent supporters for Batman. Alfred, one of my favorite characters of the whole franchise, drops several nuggets of wisdom throughout the film, and Lucius oozes cool by adding a dry sense of humor. Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), the good cop with an edge, is one of the most flat-out likable characters in the series. And Maggie Gyllenhaal is a much better Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes and quite good in her own right - she's tougher, more self-sufficient, more interesting, less of a stock character.<br />The cast is excellent, and the primary reason why I love this film so much. The Joker especially provided many memorable lines. But there's more than just that. The direction and set pieces are stunning. Most of the action takes place at night, in Gotham's slums, which makes the film seem even darker. And the soundtrack is appropriately creepy. The plot is simple - Joker causes chaos, Batman tries to stop him - but it's not the story itself, but what happens within the story, that counts here.<br />I am in awe of this film. I saw it twice in one weekend, and I never see films multiple times. I have friends who don't even like superhero movies that loved The Dark Knight. It's definitely my pick for the best film of 2008 thus far, and it's one of my all-time favorites as well. Head-and-shoulders above all other superhero films.City's White Knight.

0553296981|5.0|I knew that the Diary of Anne Frank was the second most purchased book in the world, the Bible being the first, but I still wasn't sure if I wanted to read it.<br />In our eighth grade class, our teacher is big on the Holocaust. And when she first mentioned that we would be learning about it, I was excited; to a point. I know that most kids my age think 'ooh blood and guts and gore' and think it's cool or funny or a joke. They all watch horror movies that almost make them immune to real life experiences that involve real horror or real tragedy.<br />So before we started learning about it, I wanted to know more in depth about how it was like to be a teen during the Holocaust. So, I summed up the guts and checked it out at the library. When I started reading it, I couldn't stop. Anne and I are so similar. She's always happy-go-lucky despite the terrible circumstances; she's very curious, careless, and sometimes a trouble maker. And even though I'm not Jewish, I think it's extremely easy to worm your way into her shoes. You learn so much, and it's really emotional, knowing that Anne Frank, this person you've grown attatched to, and her family, everyone except her father Otto Frank, has been killed. Slaughtered innocently by the Nazis, a cult led by Hitler that cornered them just because of their religion or their looks.<br />I think that if anyone wants to learn about the Holocaust, this is a must read; it's an amazing journey that might not end so happily, but Anne never ceased to hope. It has such vivid details of everything that sometimes it's hard to believe that something like the concentration camps and Hitler and everything existed. The fact that it's in diary form makes it all the better.<br />This non-fiction diary is amazing, and I think everyone, at some point, should read it.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|Reading reviews of this film, most of the focus seems to be on the first half, set on a planet despoiled by pollution and garbage (a common theme in science fiction). Blame is assigned to mega-corporation \\"Buy-N-Large\\" (read: Wal-Mart) and a culture of conspicuous consumption.     But as we move off-world to the floating luxury spaceship Axiom, mankind's lifeboat, we find that Buy-N-Large is no longer merely a big-box store but has now assumed the role of an all-powerful \\"nanny-state\\" government.     The so-called \\"consumers\\" are still consuming endlessly, but without any visible means to PAY for this consumption. No one is BUYING anything from Buy-N-Large anymore. On the contrary, Buy-N-Large seems to be providing an endless supply of services to its \\"customers\\" (more like \\"subjects\\"), from cradle to grave. The result is a docile population that is unmotivated, uneducated and unproductive.    Such a scenario would spell disaster for a mere big-box store, which is entirely dependent on its customers' spending in order to stay afloat. But the coersive goverment entity that Buy-N-Large has become is only made more powerful by a completely dependent population that can no longer think or provide for themselves.     Just as The Incredibles, in addition to being an superhero movie, was also a clever critique of the tyranny of political correctness and frivolous lawsuits, WALL-E manages to be a romantic comedy about robots, as well as a cautionary tale about the dangers of an all-encompassing nanny state.
B000TUXL2A|5.0|This is a Awesome CD by a Fantastic Artist! All of Mark Knopflers CD's are very good. But, This one is my personal favorite! I have always liked Artists who do there own thing. And, M.K. is definitely in that group. So, To Hell With The Critics!
B00007LTIA|3.0|\\"Tales\\" is an album that tends to divide Yes fans.  For some this is the ultimate Yes statement.  The be all and end all of progressive rock albums.  For others it is a bloated mess.  I find myself somewhere in the middle although I think the band did go a bit over the top with this one and although some of it works it is far from my favorite Yes release.  Yes had given up any aspect of commerciality on their last album \\"Close To The Edge\\" and for \\"Tales\\" they would dive into the deep end of the progressive rock pool.   So deep in fact that there was pretty much zero chance of getting any radio airplay from the album.  You have to give them credit for even attempting to put something like this album out. What is remarkable  is that for an album that was so un -comercial  it managed to hit #6 on the US charts.  Times were certainly different then.  A major lineup change took place before the album was recorded.  Original drummer Bill Bruford left the band to go on a short stint with Genesis and eventually end up with King Crimson.  Alan White replaced him for \\"Tales\\" with a totally different style.  White was more of a rock drummer while Bruford was more about finesse.  With White on board it gave the band a bit more of a punch which would become even more evident in later years.  White's talent really shows through on the final track \\"Ritual\\", where he provides a killer (and unusual) percussion movement.  The \\"Tales\\" album was originally a 2 record vinyl collection that consisted of just 4 songs each clocking in at more than 18 minutes a piece.  Again it is pretty amazing that an album like this could actually reach the top 10 in the charts, it would never happen today.  So is it any good?  Again, opinions will vary widely on this one, but for me I think there are parts of it that are brilliant, but overall I don't really think the project worked.  The first and last tracks, \\"Revealing Science Of God\\" and \\"Ritual\\" are probably the best and there are some fine individual moments from all of the players here and there.  Every member of Yes are virtuosos on their instruments and they present some of their most complicated material here.  Jon Anderson's lyrics are pretty out there for the most part.  I don't have a clue what he is singing about half the time.  Overall \\"Tales\\" is probably one of my least favorite Yes albums and I only give it about 3 stars, but there are plenty of people out there that will have the exact opposite opinion.

I have listened over and over, and hear something new each time, which is what Joni's music always does.  Yes , the voice is a little battered now, but it just adds more character and you can feel the experience that the years have brought in each song.  It is a must have and a definite keeper!!

B0011FXLCC|5.0|I can't believe people criticize this album for being different from their previous ones. Isn't that what originality is about? It would be really boring if they all sounded the same. Of course, all 4 albums have been completely different from each other, so what? They've all been great! My favorite will always be Black Cherry but I enjoy the rest as well. Seventh Tree reminds me a bit of Felt Mountain, but more energizing overall. Alison's voice is so beautiful, one of the best I've heard. Any true Goldfrapp fan will love this album, otherwise it means you only like one or two songs from years ago.
0743290119|2.0|I was pretty excited for this book because I enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada and Everyone Worth Knowing.  However, as I went through the book, I kept waiting for something to happen, and it never did.  Three friends make a pact to change their lives, or not change in the case of one of them.  The book revolves around their year of trying to change, but nothing significant or exciting really happens to any of them.  Leigh's story is the most turbulent, and perhaps on it's own, would have made a decent book.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone who has read her previous efforts
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I have been a Jane Austen fan for years! So I was excited to see the new PBS versions of the novels this last year, especially Northanger Abbey since this novel has never really been turned into a good movie (like S&S, P&P, and Emma). I loved this adaptation. The plot moves a little faster than in the book. But over all this movie was very pleasing. The actors were charming and Felicity Jones does a delightful adaptation of Catherine. The scenery is well done, although not quite the image of Northanger that I had in my imagination. The scenes of Catherine's gothic fantasies are funny, but work well with the plot. I wish they could've picked a more handsome actor for Henry, but hey, that's getting picky. Supporting actors are well cast, especially Isabella, Eleanor, and the evil General Tilney. I give this film an B+ to an A-. I love having it in my Austen-adaptation movie collection. Highly recommend it to any Jane Austen fan. Very sweet, lovely film with the happily-ever-after ending we all enjoy.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Ok, it's not the four hour A&E version but you will be amazed at how much they packed into this version while still staying true to the book.

Keira's Elizabeth is witty and sharp.  An enjoyable way to spend the evening.

B00005JPY0|5.0|After seeing it for the second time, I can confidently say that The Dark Knight is the smartest, most realistic, and best superhero movie out there. Undeniably, the movie of summer '08 and possibly of this year. If there's one movie you see this summer, it'd damn better The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The Dark Knight's storytelling is definitely one of its highlights that distinguish it from the dozens of others in its genre - it's downright gritty & serious. Rather than treating itself like a summer movie, it's a compelling suspenseful crime drama filled with dynamic plot and handles it well. You may catch a lot of details you may have missed the first time so it's definitely rewatchable. Themes about morality, anarchy, and justice exist beneath the plot which left me thinking about the points Dark Knight brings up during and after the projector light goes down.<br /><br />Effects? Yeah Dark Knight's got great ones but not the CGI heavy ones we're so used to. CGI still can't be some good ol' stunt work that give action scenes a little more depth and realism, in my opinion. Luckily, the effects work doesn't make the mistake of becoming saturated and detract from the experience.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard present the perfect music score for Dark Knight. The music that accompanies the film is mostly orchestral but there's just enough synthesized elements, such as the vigorous suspenseful buzzing-like sound, that it doesn't become annoying - excellent.<br /><br />Last but not least is the amazing casting. Christian Bale makes a solid Bruce Wayne and Batman. The lovely Maggie Gyllenhaal breathes more life into her character Rachel Dawes than Katie Holmes could into Tom Cruise's career. Thank You For Smocking's confident Aaron Eckhart as District Attorney Harvey Dent will make you believe in him because it's just fine acting. Lieutenant Gordon is back and so is his actor Gary Oldman who gets a chance to show off how great his acting is to characterizing the busy righteous cop. Finally the late Heath Ledger had the hardest but best performed role as the Joker. Never have I seen a villain so menacing as the Joker - a man who truly \\"like(s) to watch the world burn.\\"<br /><br />The Dark Knight IS Oscar quality work. Christopher Nolan has taken superhero & comic book movies to new heights and maturity. He's going to get nominated for director and with his brother Jonathan, the screenplay.

B0018AK9RA|1.0|I've been a Judas Priest fan for decades and I view each new release as a musical event.  When I first heard about Priest taking on Nostradamus I immediately believed this to be a brilliant idea; Judas Priest plus the mysterious Nostradamus seemed to be a perfect match.  I can't tell you how awful this concept album turned out to be.  Out of the 23 cuts 5 are listenable, and that's being generous.  Nostradamus is a Spinal Tap album.  It's self-important, laughable, and worse, simply embarrassing.  I've only been able to get through this album from beginning to end twice, and it was a trial.  Most songs are slow and drone, drone, drone, on and on.  There are a few moments of that old Priest we all love, but not enough to justify purchasing this album.  Don't believe me?  Scan through the samples on Amazon and prove me wrong.  I can't even muster up enthusiasm to see them live this year given how much I hate the new material.
B000005H3M|5.0|You get nine  extra numbers that weren't on the vinyl record. This CD is nothing short of amazing.   The way Buddy and the band back his young daughter on the Sonny and Cher tune entitled THE BEAT GOES ON is absolutely draw-dropping--in that they move something like a Swiss time piece. Tight. Tight. Tight.    I am not a musician, nor can I claim to know what it takes to create anything incredible--all I can tell you is I know when the stuff is great--because it fills you up inside and hammers you with a powerful rush that sends you soaring.    That's what the great artists do to you--and the late Buddy Rich and his Big Band pull it off and then some.
0385504209|3.0|Davinci Code had an interesting beginning. I liked how he drew the reader in with his introduction of the curator, langdon, the bishop and albino. Initially engrossing, but BEWARE, the last two thirds drag. He regurgitates a good deal of his plot twists as the novel wears on. I had his 'twists' and characters figured chapters ahead of time. I even guessed the last cryptic clue APPLE pages and pages before Langdon figured it out. These characters with their Ivy league PhD's should be able to outsmart me - but they didn't!<br /><br />As far as the religious controversy. Any intelligent, practicing Christian takes it with a grain of salt. Obviously, those most vulnerable to this kind of tripe are people of little faith, minimal worship and study of Christianity. Brown is so repetitive in his love of pagan rituals, sun dieties, and feminine goddess garble that it turns the reader off completely. He seems to be writing for a less intelligent audience. Why else would an author insist on such redundancy unless he felt his audience wasn't smart enough to grasp his message the first time around? Yawn.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give the first 150 pages four stars. Brown could have easily shaved off 100 of the last 200 pages and still made this a pretty good read. The last third (two stars at best) really dragged on and the ending was highly predictible (if your inferencing skills go beyond a third grade level).
6304458924|3.0|The film open on a city street. A man walks along the street, he is being watched by the police. Is he a suspect in a murder case? [Why the delay in the arrest?] He will be transported by air back to Los Angeles. Conversations tell about the flight personnel, and the passengers. The weather ahead is bad, the flight will change course. But something will happen to add drama to this story. Can everything that can go wrong happen? What if something happens to the pilot? What if a clever criminal gains control of the airplane? Will he be driven to kill again to increase the drama? [Even if it does not fit his profile?] Weaver's conversation adds more drama. \\"Do not open the door!\\"<br /><br />The empty airplane has an eerie spooky atmosphere [added drama]. Weaver's questions show his clever insanity. \\"Talk to me.\\" The turbulence adds to the drama. Will they shoot down the jumbo jet before it can crash into a city? \\"I'll never fly this airline again!\\" The scene where the 747 hits a building is strangely prophetic. \\"Don't worry about it.\\" Terry pushes the buttons to try another landing. \\"I changed my mind.\\" Will there be a happy ending to this story? It needs one to be a commercial success.<br /><br />Those who know more will probably criticize some details in this film. Parts of this film seem very cynical, others less believable. Would an LA detective plant evidence on a suspect he believed was guilty? Nobody had to do that with Ted Bundy.
B0018QCXFK|5.0|I can't get enough of these animated movies, and Bee Movie was just another must have to add to the collection.  You either like Jerry Seinfeld or you don't, but if you do, this will be a great film that you shouldn't miss.  It's not for kids really, there's a lot of adult humour which makes it all the more funny and would just go over the kids heads.    The movie looks fantastic in HD also, so just go and buy it if you haven't already seen it.
B00000DCHD|5.0|After over 10 years of struggling to hit it big, Billy Joel suddenly became an overnight sensation with his 1977 release \\"The Stranger,\\" a timeless pop masterpiece that sold over seven million copies and generated four Top 40 hits as well as won Joel a few Grammys for his mantle. With his star suddenly burning, Joel was quick to come up with a followup to match the unprecedented success of his breakthrough album. The result was \\"52nd Street,\\" which managed to match its predecessor in terms of sales as well as quality.<br /><br />The album begins with its three big hit singles. First up is the crunchy in-your-face rocker \\"Big Shot,\\" a stinging damnation of fame and the arrogance that comes with its first taste. With its bombastic riff and biting Billy vocal, \\"Big Shot\\" is an absolutely Joel classic, and remains a thrill in concert.<br /><br />Next up is the Sinatra-esque ballad \\"Honesty,\\" in which Billy openly and sincerely expresses his most important value in a relationship. With its passionate vocal and thoughtful lyrics, \\"Honesty\\" will get under your skin with its haunting beauty.<br /><br />Next up is the album's biggest hit of the three, \\"My Life,\\" a chugging declaration of youthful independence with some of Joel's most intricate keyboard fills and a punchy in your face rhythm underscored by its obnoxious (in a good way) chorus. Another Joel classic that remains a concert highlight.<br /><br />With the hits out of the way, we dig into the lesser known album cuts, which begin with the zesty jazz opus \\"Zanzibar.\\" A classic Joel portrayal of New York nightlife, many label this track is overindulgent and pretentious, but I'm of the opposite opinion. While it doesn't match the previous album's epic number (\\"Scenes From An Italian Restaurant\\"), \\"Zanzibar\\" carries a zest and flavor all its own that makes a landmark Joel track. The horn solo that closes out the track is incredible.<br /><br />Next comes my favorite non-album track. \\"Stiletto\\" starts of with a dark, ominous sax solo before a few finger snaps underscored by a thumping bass line lead into Joel's hellraising piano stacattos, rivaling \\"Angry Young Man\\" and \\"Root Beer Rag\\" as the prime example of Joel's unbeatable keyboard prowess.<br /><br />The mood changes once more with the mellow, Latin tanged \\"Rosalinda's Eyes,\\" a tender love song reminscent of Elton John's \\"Tiny Dancer.\\" It's a great song and one I wish Billy would dust off in concert.<br /><br />Next comes another New York centered rocker, the thrilling \\"Half A Mile Away.\\" With is opening horn roars and Billy's gritty vocals, this is one of the album's highlights and one of his best songs.<br /><br />\\"Until The Night\\" is an epic ballad, and one of his all time bests. A big fave among die hard fans, it's a little lengthy, but Billy keeps it fresh and honest, and the result is an honest, passionate love song.<br /><br />The album's brief title track closes thigns off. It's nice, but easily the most disposable track on the album. Fortunately, with  the  advent of cd burners and stop buttons, you can easily end the album with \\"Until The Night\\" and let it go out on a high note.<br /><br />\\"52nd Street\\" is another pop masteriece by one of the genre's most talented and influential individuals.

Fast Forward to today i went right to the store and bought scars on broadway and man let me tell you this is the best rock album i have heard all year. Not 1 bad song on the album no fillers nothinglike that. I hope there is more scars to come but for now this is an exceelent debut. All i can say is good work Daron and John
0670020745|4.0|What a fascinating voyage for the reader as well as the author of this book.  Dr. Taylor provides a clear and detailed description of what can happen when a stroke occurs.  Her vivid analysis of the underlyng repurcussions of having blood flood the brain are so vivid yet they are understandable by a layperson like myself.<br />My favorite part of the book is how her mother (also a doctor) guides Dr. Taylor back into the world of language and connectedness to the living.  The descriptions of the various steps of re-teaching the most simple tasks will give the readers of this book a concise process for how to give a loved one who has had a stroke the way back.  And, the reader comes to understand the immensity of having a stroke---maybe helping some people into making some life changes to lessen the chance of stroke for themselves.  Good read!<br /><br />FOOTNOTE in 2013:  I managed to loan out the book and forget who borrowed it until I received a phone call from the person.  She had read the book and had subsequently had a mild stroke.  Because of what she learned in the book, she was able to realize she had something going on and didn't wait to call for help.  Others might have said \\"oh, this will pass,  I am just tired\\".  She had, in fact, had a stroke and reaching out for help saved her brain from further harm.
B000AOEMXM|3.0|I caught some episodes of Season 1 and decided I wanted to see more of Capt Jonathon Archer and the first Enterprise. It was also cool to have a lesser-known Rod Stewart song be the series theme song. (Which by the way was also in Patch Adams.)<br /><br />So while I don't regret getting the 4 season set, I did not find the entire series compelling. Good enough, but nothing ground breaking besides the \\"retro-continuity\\" fixing why klingons don't have bumpy foreheads in the TOS, etc.<br /><br />I also liked the Brent Spiner guest-star episodes (big fan of Spiner).<br /><br />I thought the Temporal Cold War was a bad idea, and the Xindi War was an unnecessary diversion.

B000WAEK0E|5.0|A misnomer of a title if ever there was one. Van Morrison is one of those peculiar figures in that while he's undoubtedly a major artist he has actually had very few hits, and the majority of music lovers would probably be hard pressed to name more than half a dozen of his songs. Even Brown Eyed Girl, perhaps his best known - certainly most frequently played - song wasn't a hit in Britain. Van is also unusual in that he's perhaps the only major artist, or certainly long standing musician, who hasn't had either a box set or at least a multi disc best of collection. Of course this 3 disc release now remedies that. For the less committed there is also a 2 disc version. Of course Van's output has been that prolific it could easily run to another disc, or even 2 more! There have been the Best of and Best of Volume 2 and the only recenly released Best of Vol 3, which itself was a double disc, but this collection, whether you buy the 2 or 3 disc version will now supplant them as the premier Van Morrison compilation.   Having said this it is still far from perfect. Firstly,the annotation is extremely skimpy, nor do we get photos. Detailed notes and decent photos are what we have come to expect from proper box sets, and both are totally lacking here. The presentation is very similar to the 3 disc Elton John set that came out a few years ago, however that had much better annotation and more photos. Still On Top - The Greatest Hits (they have to add that, as Morrison already has an album called Back On Top, a similar title) isn't arranged chronologically either,jumping about all over the place without any obvious theme. This may not bother some people, but I find it irritating. I feel that a definitive compilation should trace an artist's career sensibly.   Now we come to the music, and I must be honest here, although I have quite a few Morrison albums I don't like all he's done and I actively dislike some of his output. His first 'proper' album Astral Weeks is not only regarded as his greatest, but one of the greatest rock albums period. I can see why, in that it's full of what were for the time original soundscapes, but it's not an easy listen; and the compilers seem to recognise that here as they haven't included one single track from that album - a 3 disc set and nothing from what is regarded as the artist's greatest release! This in itself is bizarre and shows how hard it is to compile Van Morrison. Astral Weeks is not the only album to have nothing from it here, quite a few others are similarly neglected, whilst other have up to 4 tracks taken from them, which means that the compilation isn't really a definitive overview. One of the most heavily represented with 4 tracks is his next album, Moondance, and I would suggest this is because it was the nearest Morrison came to making a truly great album. Despite the inclusion of the title track, Crazy Love, And It Stoned Me and the brilliant Into the Mystic (perhaps my favourite Morrison song) the compilers have still had to omit classics such as Caravan and These Dreams Of You.   I generally prefer Van's up temp r n b influenced songs rather than his long drawn out excursions into celtic mysticism or whatever it's called, consequently I lost interest in him after Hard Nose The Highway although I did reagain it more recently and bought his 3 relatively recent albums: Back On Top, Down The Road and Magic Time. Personally I think these are as good as anything he's done in his long career,as do the compilers here, taking 2 tracks each from Back On top and Magic Time and 3 from Down The Road. Another album heavily represented is Avalon Sunset with 4 tracks; this was a Morrison album I used to own, but sold.   Ultimately, despite the eccentricities of some of the selections here, this is as definitive complilation of Van Morrison as you're going to get. Because of the length of his career and vast output it would be difficult to like all he's done. Van also has the tendency sometimes to ruina song with endless repetition or simply silly noises. See for example Georgia On My Mind, on the otherwise excellent Down The Road, thankfully not included here. He tends to do this on the longer songs, which in Morrison's ouvre are usually long, not because of any instrumental virtuosity but because of vocal self indulgence; consequently the 11 minute Listen to the Lion from St Dominic's Preview actually ceases to be a song after about 5 minutes and turns into a repetitive dirge - this happens to much of Astral Weeks, presumably this is why nothing has been included here. Instead of Listen To The Lion or one or two of the other long dirges, such as the irritating Rave On John Donne, I would have liked to have had more of the shorter r n b type tracks, such as Call Me Up In Dreamland from His Band and the Street Choir or the aforementioned These Dreams Of You from Moondance.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Death is the narrator in this haunting tale of the young book thief - a German girl thrust into foster care following the arrest of her Communist father and the sudden death of her starving brother. While she copes with such devastating losses, Death describes the troubled relationships she forms with her foster father, best friend, and a Jewish man the family finds itself hiding, as well as the various people lives around. The characters are honest, blemished, and timeless. With its odd choice of narrator, this is probably going to be a love it or hate it book, more appropriate for a teen or adult audience.<br /><br />EDIT: I wanted to add that the drawings are included on the kindle edition, and while a bit difficult to make out details (they are simple drawings though - so this just may be the way they are), they digitized perfectly.

B00005OBSD|5.0|Let me begin by saying that I consider myself quite well versed in good classic rock: Zeppelin, Floyd, Stones, etc.  I have, over the years, delved deeply into the catalogues of these and many other artists.  My hope is to discover a lost and forgotten classic album or two in their canons: consider Meddle by Pink Floyd; Backless by Clapton; On the Beach by Neil Young.  Well, the phrase \\"lost and forgotten\\" certainly applies to the band Free.<br /><br />Where do I begin?  Well, Tons of Sobs is Free's first album, made when they were mere teenagers.  There is a maturity in their playing, arranging, and writing that most certainly belies their years.  The entire album should be considered blues/rock with a healthy dose of edge and attitude...though no posing and pretension.  Listen to Paul Rogers strut his way through instant classics like \\"The Mover\\" and \\"Wild Indian Woman\\" (just two of many original tunes).  His singing, though teeming with sexual grit, is controlled yet explosive.  And though he is regarded as a fine white blues singer--in the same company as Robert Plant & Gregg Allman--he is most definitely underrated.<br /><br />And speaking of underrated, let's talk about Paul Kossoff.  What a travesty that the late guitarist does not gain any substantial coverage in guitar magazines or lists of top guitarists.  His tone, vibrato, and soloing are all undeniably first-rate.  He certainly has a signature sound: it can be described most accurately through the title of a Free song: \\"Molten Gold.\\"  His playing is tasteful, never too showy, and demonstrates an affinity and flair for blues.  Listen to the two covers on the album: \\"Goin' Down Slow\\" and \\"The Hunter.\\"  His playing is never predictable and always emotive.<br /><br />Free didn't seem to have the flamboyance and mystique of their UK brethren, Led Zeppelin.  But nevertheless, this was one hell of a band.  Great rhythm section in Fraser and Kirke; great choice of covers; great originals; and two all-stars in Rogers and Kossoff.<br /><br />Bottom line: this band transcends the stigma they inherited from their one major hit, \\"Alright Now\\" (not on this album; it appears on their third, Fire and Water).  They have much more to offer!
B000EHSVS2|5.0|My tape of Patton finally couldn't cut it anymore.  It just wore out.  I bought the DVD and the picture on my new high def TV was great.  I've seen the movie dozens of times and this is the best since the original on the movie screen.  The companion DVD reviewing the original shooting of the film is great also.  This is a very good package.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|90$, at the time of this review, for all these discs in this package is a great deal.  This was a great trilogy, and the extras in here, which include the Animatrix which was amazing, are just too good to pass up for this price!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Of the six or seven BBC classics I have seen, this one is special on the grounds that it is, independently from the literary original, a extraordinarily well made film. Five stars to the people who created this fabulous film! The film music is also amazing.
0671799320|5.0|Truly worth the pulitizer prize, a great read, a great view of history..but..don't buy the paperback. This book literally fell out of it's binding before I got through the first one hundred pages. By the time I got to the epilogue I had little more than a pile of loose pages. I don't own the hard cover, but I can tell you that the soft cover is a piece of junk. Too bad the binders didn't respect the greatness of the book.
0789318121|3.0|Is the book cover suppose to be the other way around? I can't find any reviews stating that.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Believe the hype. Very rarely does a movie generate so much hype, so much buzz, and so much acclaim that it lives up to it. Maybe it does for me more than others, but \\"The Dark Knight\\" delivers on everything it promises and then some. This is pretty heavy stuff and not suitable for the real young kiddies. Director Christopher Nolan and his amazingly talented cast and crew have put together a film that would almost seem an injustice to refer to as a \\"comic book movie\\" or a \\"superhero movie\\", because it just seems like it's not. It's a very dark, gritty, crime drama that just happens to have two people dressed up as a bat and a clown in it. If Michael Mann or Martin Scorsese directed a Batman movie, it might turn out looking something like this.    Gotham City. It has Batman(Christian Bale), District Attorney Harvey Dent(Aaron Eckhardt), and Lt. James Gordon(Gary Oldman), all trying to turn the crime rate on it's ear. Batman/Bruce Wayne sees hope in Harvey Dent, but hope seems to be ready to be destroyed when a madman wearing clown make-up and get up wanders into town ready to unleash his special brand of chaos and mayhem. This is the Joker, and Heath Ledger is ready to stun, amaze, frighten, and captivate you with his unbelieveable performance.    The movie and it's taut, tight direction from Nolan is one for the books. A movie is only as good as it's cast, and this one is no exception from the amazing cast 'Batman Begins' had. First and foremost is Ledger. There is no denying the talent he had, and it's on full display here. This is not Cesar Romero or Jack Nicholson. This is something nobody has seen before. Ledger loses himself in the role and never resurfaces. What you are seeing is the Joker, alive and well in all his glory. His tics and delivery are spot on, and it is something that will stay with you long after the movie is over. There is definitley an Oscar nomination in the future for this portrayal. Elsewhere, Bale continues to be the solid footing for thewhole epic event, and he is the best Batman, and a great Bruce Wayne. His growling Batman voice is still unsettling and a bit unnerving, but he is Batman. Maggie Gyllenhall takes over for Katie Holmes, and she does what she can, but the role still feels like just the \\"female\\" as in the first film. Michael Caine and Gary Oldman are as solid and dependable as ever, if only they had more to do.    The movie looks great. I love the gothic look of Tim Burton's Gotham, and the very colorful, comic book dowsed Gotham from Joel Schumacher, but this Gotham takes place in the real world. This could be your city. Nolan obviously had a ball filming Chicago(as Gotham)and everything else, because the movie is a wonderful sight to behold. The action has been amped up, the movie and tone darker, and the ante has been upped in just about every way. The script is tight and holds itself together, something that doesn't always happen in comic bo....oh, there's those words again. The movie races from start to finish and is never boring, even if the rather long running time may have you thinking otherwise.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is the, okay I'll say it, comic book and superhero movie that all others that come afterward should be measured. It raises the bar increasingly high. Marvel may seem to of gotten a lot of the spotlight here lately, but DC and Batman have now put the stamp on how it should be. It's a great movie.
B001B71NOI|5.0|I've always loved Trent Reznor and his musical style but for some reason this album seems to remind me of his early days. I first downloaded the digital download off of the bands website From the instant i heard the entire album i knew i had to own it. It's loud with great beats but yet in moments it conveys his meloncholy side. I find it to be a great work out music. Trent Reznor will have you singing along for hours after you've finished listening to this album.  Lights in the sky has to be one of my favorites from the get go it's morose melody strikes you and brings you down into his sullen thoughts. Unlike many of his other albums it's a little on the short side for my liking but other wise I found that it was a musical feast for the senses.
B000ESST6U|5.0|Hardly the jejune form of opera that Gluck railed against. Much of the energy for this staging emanates from Danielle De Niese, who surely could charm a eunuch, in the role of Cleopatra.  John McVickers is to be praised for this production; Christie also -- as usual.
0143038583|5.0|The author has four hypotheses about how we Americans may have become such dysfunctional eaters, and about how our food supplies and our diets came to be the way they are.<br /><br />Although interesting, this book was not exactly what I was expecting. I was hoping Pollan would get deeper into how the collusion between the US Food and Drug Administration and Agribusiness have conspired to product the \\"sugar and fat laden\\" diets that have become the staple of our nation for ordinary Americans and how we cannot easily get around Coke Cola, McDonald's Hamburgers and French fries etc. to a more healthy diet - at least without being better educated and without it being very inconvenient  and expensive to these life-shortening and health-killing alternatives. As an almost 70-year old Southerner who grew up on red meats, fried foods, coke, cigarettes and hard liquor, and now have the ABCs and D's of American health (Asthma, Arthritis, hardening arteries, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes, I can attest to the fact that there is little time to wax eloquent and romantic about the niceties of the American diet.<br /><br />Although the history of the life cycle of corn, and how it effects our lives is interesting, and goes part of the way down the path to better understanding, it does not go nearly far enough. Given that it is no accident that 65% of us are overweight, and experience serious health problems similar to my own, and at an increasingly earlier age, and that we have no secure health system, American health is indeed no casual or laughing matter.<br /><br />In light of all of this, this piece seems a bit gratuitous - just short of being flippant and in a larger sense a bit negligent. I believe a much needed golden opportunity to educate the American public about the forces that conspire to shape and \\"lock us into\\" our poor diets and health, was lost.<br /><br />At another time and another place (perhaps in Europe, where the older people are healthier than the young in the U.S.), this would have been a book to celebrate. But today, with our health as well as our healthcare crisis, this book is a luxury that the ordinary American public can ill-afford. For a missed opportunity, and for making only a timid and glancing blow at the nation's number one health problem, three stars. Otherwise, it would have easily been a five star effort.
0316776963|5.0|I've read most of David Sedaris' books and this is my favorite.  I bought this one because I loaned my first copy out and can't remember who has it.  I'll happily read it again and laugh.
B00005ASHM|5.0|It's really difficult to overrate 1966's \\"Pet Sounds\\".  Aside from its influence on other musicians (\\"God Only Knows\\" spurred on Paul McCartney, for example, in the game of one-upmanship between the Beatles and the Beach Boys during the late '60s), it remains, quite simply, one of the most enjoyable pop albums ever released--like your favorite cold beverage on a very hot day.  Even the two instrumentals, \\"Let's Go Away For Awhile\\" and \\"Pet Sounds\\", fit into the sequencing perfectly.  The other Boys may not have grasped exactly where Brian Wilson's head was at (there's not a single car or surfing song on the entire record), but they deliver vocally--listen to Carl Wilson's lead on \\"God Only Knows\\", and Mike Love's backing on \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice.\\"  (If you want to spend a few more bucks, buy the \\"Pet Sounds Sessions\\" box, which contains outtakes demonstrating Brian's total control in the studio.)  Not only the best album by this vital group, but, quite simply, one of the very best pop albums ever made.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|This is a charming family entertainment with a preposterous plot line: witches, magical transformations, and all the rest of the panoply of fairytale lore.  What makes it special are the cameo roles from Peter O'Toole, David Kelly, and Ricky Gervaise - and most of all the superb Salty Dog/Drag Queen role for DeNiro which so obviously delights him that it delights the viewer too.  This is one of those movies that you watch again and again for the small details, the moments of magic that occur in the interstices of the plot-line which add up to a cumulative pleasure not easily surpassed.  If you don't happen to have small children, try to rent a couple for a few hours in order to justify watching this movie at least once.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I thought this was a great concert. You get John Mayer in three phases. I loved it.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This collection is truly a classic movie from Kubrick.  Of interest will be the special disc that has been added.
0385340990|5.0|This is an utterly delightful little book and, in fact, much meatier than its slim 240 pages suggest. Its story -- of the unfolding discovery of the characters of Guernsey and their charismatic and quirky endurance of the Nazi occupation of the island between 1940 and 1945 by writer Juliet Ashton in the immediate post-war period -- is revealed piecemeal, and through illuminating changes in perspectives, via a series of letters exchanged between the book's various central characters. This device is by no means new, but it is used to perfection here by Mary Ann Shaffer (and posthumously completed by her niece, Annie Barrows) who manages to convey not only the individual natures of the various characters through their varying writing styles and nuances of expression, but also the very feel of a by-gone age, when life was indeed conducted at a pace that could be sustained through a correspondence using the postal service.<br /><br />Shaffer evokes the character of the post-war years perfectly and handles the experiences of the Nazi occupation with a sensitive mix of humour and gravitas, making the story both amusing and moving by turns, while at the same time sustaining a number of other independent story threads, which combine to make for a highly entertaining and engaging read, which kept me enthralled right to the very end.<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone seeking something light but edifying.
0743496736|4.0|Its Jodi Picoult - fast & readable but not a meaty novle; as far as this topic of school shootings the book to read is \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" by Lionel Shriver.
B001B71NOI|5.0|I enjoyed this album from start to finish. Personally it didn't take some getting used to. I preordered it as soon as I could and I received it last week from Amazon. I very much recommend it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have ran for 16 years and was not losing any weight from doing the same routine day in and day out.  Found Jillian online and thought I would give it a try.  This workout was much harder then I expected and I enjoyed the challenge.  I then purchased the combo pack of Jillians workouts and LOVE THEM ALL.  I rotate and combine 2 of her DVD's for an hour of intensity that has really made a difference.  My weight is finally coming down and I'm more toned than ever before.  Definitely recommended for exercisers wanting someone to whip them into shape.
0452289963|1.0|I read this book for a bookclub discussion.  I must say that I was skeptical to begin with, but after 300 plus pages of mind-numbing abstract language, I almost felt sick.  Tolle has reduced himself to a shell  of a person with no ego, no emotions, no thoughts, no past, no future in the mistaken view that somehow his detachment makes him a deeper, more spiritual being.  Unfortunately, I see him as a social misfit who has managed to hypnotize himself with endless verbiage so that he doesn't have to face up to the pain and suffering that are a normal part of existence. His denial is a psychological defense mechanism to help him cope with the assaults on his ego  (he thought he was going to be a great intellectual until his college experience proved otherwise).  The tradeoff of so much denial is a feeling of righteousness and resulting power that the puritan exchanges for pleasure. I don't trust anyone for advice who has isolated himself or herself from society.  Engagement and involvement in life are so much more pleasurable than detachment even though you can be hurt when you invest yourself and your emotions.<br /><br />It's healthy to have an ego; usually the insecure are those who need to compensate by defensiveness.  People with big egos are often more interesting than the shy, retiring type. Tolle's book will fade like all the others because it doesn't understand psychology, people's drives,  or their needs,  What he offers is magic--all problems will magically disappear by becoming aware--aware of something we already know: we exist.<br /><br />To really learn about human nature and how to live a life, literature can help people explore.  Instead of taking a class trying to decipher the meaningless abstract chatter of Tolle (consider this excerpt:\\"Although the unmanifested realm of pure consciousness could be considered another dimension it is not separate from this dimension of form.  Form and formlessness interpenetrate.  The unmanifested flow into this dimension as awareness, inner space, Presence.  How doe it do that? Through the human form that becomes conscious and thus fulfills its destiny.  The human form was created for this higher purpose, and millions of other forms prepared the ground for it., p. 291 )  consider taking a class in Shakespeare or Samuel Beckett who know more about life than Tolle will ever know.ess, inner space, Presence.  How doe it do that? Through the human form that becomes conscious and thus fulfills its destiny.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|\\"Serenity\\" is a movie for fans of the late, great TV series, \\"Firefly.\\" But this isn't to say you can't watch \\"Serenity\\" as a stand alone movie. It has everything a sci-fi fan could want -- a good story, great characters (including three gorgeous women), lots of action, cool looking spaceships, and delightful humor.      And for the \\"Firefly\\" fans, it answers a few questions you might have had but never got the answers to because the show was canceled before it was given the chance to draw in enough viewers to keep it on the air.     Treat youself to a fun movie, you won't be sorry!
B000AOA2G8|5.0|For removing crank assembly of certain bikes no other tool will do.  It looks good and works well.
B00132D808|2.0|You have to respect the band for going off in such a radical direction, and pulling it off decently. The songs are well done, with the first half of the album being catchy and pleasant. I have to say, actually, that when the album first came out, I listened to it once through and hated it. Didn't listen to it again until tonight. And I actually enjoyed the first half alright(Northern Downpour and When The Day Met The Night being my favorites), but I have to say that as a Panic at the Disco fan, I feel betrayed. I appreciate the desire to branch out because doing the exact same thing over and over does not make great music, but to completely leave behind the lightning fast lyrics and dance beats that made me fall in love with this band feels disrespectful to the great music they put out in their first album. Pretty. Odd. says to me, \\"That first album was what we thought we needed to play to get popular, we didn't actually like any of it. This is what we really want to sound like.\\" The second half of the CD was incredibly disappointing,  since I found their Beatles' \\"influence\\" to border on plagarism(especially Behind the Sea, which ties for worst song on the album with Folkin' Around, in my AFYCSO-loving opinion).     Is this the worst album I ever heard? No, definitely not. Their musicianship is lovely, and the first half the album is an interesting departure from what we've come to know as solid Panic style. But there was no Panic in this album. No Passion. And definitely no Disco. Try thinly-veiled rip-off with a side of country, with a few good tunes in spite of it all. Regardless, I can't wait for a third album to see if they temper the two styles into a happy medium that pleases us all(since this new style has brought many new fans into the fold).
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This show has it all!  I thought the first year was terrific but season two kicks up another notch.  \\"Croatoan\\" demonstrates the quick wit of the show when, in a town contaminated by a deadly virus, people turn zombie killers. Jensen Ackless remarks, \\"Why do I feel like Chuck Heston in THE OMEGA MAN ?\\"
B000007ODY|3.0|I was disappointed by the quality of the recording. Many sections of the orchestra sounded muddy and indistinct, particularly the strings; while the brass sounded harsh.
1883010039|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It has a lot of good information for everyone. It wasn't written for the complete beginner though. Even with that said, I think, if you're interested in getting started and learning the language etc., this is a very good book to start with.
B001AW9DKK|4.0|While it's good to have some of CSNY's live show documented, it's seems like a little more could be made available. Yeah, Neil has assured that this \\"soundtrack\\" complements his documentary and it does.  But, what about the rest of the songs peformed at the shows? CSNY was doing 2 1/2 or 3 hour show and trotting out a really excellent set. Hopefully, the team (Neil) will take the fans into consideration and make more available when the DVD is released. (What about a bonus DVD of one of the concerts to complement the documentary? That would be nice).
0671027344|5.0|Honestly, this book was amazing.  I feel like almost anyone would be able to relate to Charlie or his friends.  This book was given to me by my best friend and, even though I put off reading it for a year, I picked it up and read it in 5 hours.  I was sucked into the world of a 15 year old boy.  It reminds me of almost everyone I know and love.  I definitely recommend this to anyone!
B0011HOEY4|5.0|THE TRAILERS FOR THIS MOVIE MADE IT OUT TO BE REALLY GOOD, IT WAS. IT HELD OUR ATTENTION AND WE THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT. (RE: THE UNCUT/UNRATED VERSION)
B00005JN8Z|5.0|Quo Vadis was released in 1951 which is two years before the advent of CinemaScope and other widescreen formats of 1953. Quo Vadis was released theatrically in the aspect ratio of 1.33:1, so do not look for a widescreen version on DVD. The movie is an epic in the true sense of the word. Peter Ustinov steals every scene with his wonderful, self indulgent performance as Nero. Patricia Laffan (Devil Girl From Mars) delivers a deliciously evil performance. Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr star as Roman leader and persecuted Christian, respectively. If you enjoy movies like The Robe, Demetrious and The Gladiators, Salome, you will love Quo Vadis. (See if you can spot unknown Sophia Loren as slave girl. Originally, Elizabeth Taylor was suppossed to star with Gregory Peck in Quo Vadis. One day she showed up for fun, got in costume and may be seen in one of the arena scenes).
B000089CJI|5.0|This is very innovative music. It is electronic trancey music that is quite different from most stuff you will have heard, partly because it is not composed or played like \\"ordinary\\" electronic music. It is quite impressive in its soundscapes with a texture is is almost organic.
B001BMKOZW|4.0|System of a Down are on hiatus and doing their own thing, reminiscent of what KISS did years ago... except without as much hype now. Serj Tankian has already released his rock album under his name, Shavo Odadjian has been collaborating with someone from Wu-Tang Clan in a project called Achozen, and Daron Malakian and John Dolmayan are Scars on Broadway. While not all the KISS solo albums were standouts, Scars on Broadway is sure to be the opposite in System land, arguably topping Tankian's already over-played radio singles. Those who prefer the instrumental sounds of System of a Down will most likely enjoy this more than the sounds of Tankian, who just can't compete [with instruments in hand] with the talents of his System band mates.<br /><br />Malakian reports that he has had an abundance of material lying around, some of which was recorded on keyboard and drum machine. The mix and production sounds good here, though. Obviously there is more to these songs than a keyboard and drum machine. Casey Chaos was allegedly a vocalist some years ago, but none of these songs feature him. Most songs are barely longer than three minutes, two of which are just over two minutes - \\"Serious\\" and \\"Stoner-Hate,\\" but there are sixteen tracks in compensation (seventeen in the iTunes edition, which includes the instrumental title track).<br /><br />Unlike System of a Down's chaotic, all-over-the-place riffing and lyrics, the style and structure of Scars' self-titled effort is mostly rock. Not quite all rock, there are slight punk and alternative tones as well. And of course there are traces of metal here and there (the two aforementioned shortest songs actually are very System-like), but the material is classically influenced, with Malakian's inspiration coming from the likes of Neil Young and David Bowie. Although very much explicit, lyrics are sung with feeling and a bit of effort - they aren't forced out. There isn't a lot of screaming, and the electronic sounds and guitars are cool complements. \\"Funny\\" and \\"World Long Gone\\" are good examples of this. Also, \\"Enemy\\" presents a Western-ish sound; you could ride a horse to this song. It'd be nice to see what could come of this project in the future as there are different things going on throughout the album that can be built upon, but this one-time deal still makes for an appreciated catch.Funny\\" and \\"World Long Gone\\" are good examples of this.

B0016OMFPW|5.0|Five HUGE Stars!! Jazz music flourishes in the hands of double Grammy-winner Roy Hargrove: hands holding both his flaming trumpet & flugelhorn and his brilliantly arranged themes and compositions. Roy Hargrove continues to showcase his brilliant trumpet virtuosity, open and muted, both of which escape the spell of Miles. This is one of the most approachable and enjoyable CDs of the year: carrying a definite Blue Note 1960's tinge at times (which is to say-timeless) and at other times just plain great modern Hargrove music. Mr Hargrove is assisted by a highly talented group of musicians which includes: Justin Robinson on alto/tenor sax and flute, Gerald Clayton on piano, Danton Boller on bass, and Montez Coleman on drums, all of whom solo brilliantly and interplay in a highly empathetic way. The rhythm section is particularly impressive as are Messrs. Clayton and Robinson, individually. Roy's goal was to produce enjoyable, engaging, unpretentious music and he succeeded on all levels!!<br /><br />The 'best of the best' begins with Cedar Walton's marvelous \\"I'm Not So Sure\\" with Roy blowing hot liquid notes in a great solo and his band-mates likewise soloing assuredly in a song cast with a gospel/funk glow. \\"Joy Is Sorrow Unmasked\\" is pure jazz beauty, voiced to perfection and soloed wonderfully. \\"Rouge\\" is  wonderful unison playing all the way through, somewhat in the area code of Charles Mingus' \\"Self-Portrait in Three Colors\\", but still individualistic, and \\"Divine\\" has Roy in solo ballad mode on flugelhorn. \\"The Stinger\\" is a multi-tiered delight, with Justin Robinson getting off a great solo, showing some Cannonball influences. The funky playful \\"Strasbourg/St. Denis\\" has a laid-back beat and superb solos that emulate a bright sunny day and which stay in the mind for days. \\"Brown\\" is pushed along by Montez Coleman's rimshots and beautiful unison muted trumpet and sax. In all, a great jazz CD of 14 songs that is one of the best of 2008, so far. Bravo, Roy Hargrove!! My Highest Recommendation. Five Big Stars<br />(This review is based on an iTunes digital download.<br />Trivia: Roy Hargrove was 'discovered' by trumpet master Wynton Marsalis.)! My Highest Recommendation.

B000T05R8Q|5.0|Great. Thats all i can say.... This album is Pink Floyd's first album and only with there original lead singer, Syd Barrett. Eleven tracks in total on the orignal album 41:07 long its the most 41 psychedellic minutes in your life this cd has everything on it. Plus its one of the only Pink Floyd albums you need besides a few selected CDS. Recording for this album started in Febuary of 1967 right around the time Pink Floyd realesed there first single, \\"Arnold Layne\\", b/w, \\"Candy And A Currant Bun\\". Also The Piper At The Gates Of Dawn was recorded at abby road studios at the same time which The Beatles were recording there album, \\"Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". It took them till July of that year too get it done. Realesed in the UK on August 5th 1967 this album really is a true acid rock album.<br /><br />1. Astronomy Domine, Clocking in at around four minutes its a great acid rock song too open this album. It starts off with a walkie talkie voice than gets into this really psychedellic riff and the guitar is just the icing on the cake in this song, classic acid rock song, 5/5 stars<br /><br />2. Lucifer Sam, A more faster groove on this and with a really cool riff. A Pink Floyd song that they never played live that much but is a great way too really get things going on this album, theres really not much more too say, 5/5 stars<br /><br />3. Matilda Mother, One of the more fairy tale type songs on here and demonstrates that psychedelic songs dont have too be twenty minutes long, Starts out with just bass and organ and than the singing come in and by one minute it gets into a really psychedelic part of the song but comes too a stop at barely three minutes long, 5/5 stars<br /><br />4. Flaming, A very weird song but good, And another demonstration of psychedelic music not being twenty mintues long. I dont know what else too say, 5/5 stars<br /><br />5. Pow R. Toc H., Defenently not one of my faviortes on this album but it still is a pretty good song and was the last song too be recorded for this album. Its more of a jazz song and shows Rick Wrights talent at the keyboards. Lots of piano good song, 5/5 stars<br /><br />6. Take Up Thy Stephoscope And Walk, The first of many songs written by Roger Waters. Its an pretty good song but its sort of weird compared too other songs on it its okay i dont know what else too say 4/5 stars<br /><br />7. Interstellar Overdrive, The greatest jam ever. The riff is great and this song is just genius. Its litterly amazing. Than at the end when the song is like swirrling out of one speaker too the other is amazing. Probaly the best song out of this whole album i love it, 5/5 stars<br /><br />8. The Gnome, Now things get more realaxed after the insanity of the last song. Another little fairly tale song from the mind of Syd Barrett its only 2 minutes long and it really dosent make sense why its on that album, 4/5 stars<br /><br />9. Chapter 24, A very slow moving extreme acid influenced song its really just organ and a gong being hit on with a mallet and Syd Barrets singing great song though its very underrated, 5/5 stars<br /><br />10. The Scarecrow, i have never liked this song at all its not good the one song on here thats not really that good, 2/5 stars<br /><br />11. Bike, A cool song too finish off this album and is fast moving at first but at the two minute mark theres just tons of weird noise and than the album is finished and alls well ends well, 5/5 stars<br /><br />The bonus stuff on this 40th anniversery are great including the two b sides, Candy And A Currant Bun, and Apples And Oranges, and the outtakes are cool too but i actullay dont have this reissue i have the 1994 remaster but ive heard the other songs one because i have early singles two i got some of the others off iTunes.<br /><br />So if you read my reveiw and arent sure too buy this album....<br />BUY THIS ALBUM<br />For any fan of rock music around...<br />R.I.P. Syd Barrettm. Its more of a jazz song and shows Rick Wrights talent at the keyboards. Lots of piano good song, 5/5 stars    6. Take Up Thy Stephoscope And Walk, The first of many songs written by Roger Waters. Its an pretty good song but its sort of weird compared too other songs on it its okay i dont know what else too say 4/5 stars    7. Interstellar Overdrive, The greatest jam ever. The riff is great and this song is just genius. Its litterly amazing. Than at the end when the song is like swirrling out of one speaker too the other is amazing. Probaly the best song out of this whole album i love it, 5/5 stars    8. The Gnome, Now things get more realaxed after the insanity of the last song. Another little fairly tale song from the mind of Syd Barrett its only 2 minutes long and it really dosent make sense why its on that album, 4/5 stars    9. Chapter 24, A very slow moving extreme acid influenced song its really just organ and a gong being hit on with a mallet and Syd Barrets singing great song though its very underrated, 5/5 stars    10.

0743297334|2.0|My main beef with this book was that no one was likable AT ALL. They were all a bunch of morally-bankrupt, selfish and snobby rich Americans who trot all over Europe satisfying their whims and drinking themselves into oblivion, all while imposing their disgusting lives on other people.(Autobiographical?) If you took out every reference to how drunk these people got, this would be a 50-page novella. You might say, \\"That's what Hemingway was trying to portray\\". OK, in that sense this was a powerful book because the characters' pathetic lives were so vividly impressed upon my mind. Perhaps. However, I could never recommend this novel for the very subject matter and tone of the novel. Hemingway's writing is, simply put, bizarre. He translates Spanish syntax anad phrasing into English, which results in awkward-sounding phrases and his descriptive abilities are marginal. I would pass on this one.
0385340990|4.0|In the early months after WWII, on the last stops of a book tour for her compilation of light-hearted war-time columns, London writer Juliet Ashton can't seem to find a fitting topic for her next book project. Enter a letter from Dawsey Adams, a resident of Guernsey island in the English Channel, who has found Juliet's name and address in his favorite book and inquires about obtaining other titles. They begin a correspondence through which Juliet learns about the German occupation of Guernsey and how books saved the lives (and spirits) of Dawsey and his friends there.<br /><br />Told in epistolary format -- letters, telegrams, cables, diary entries, and personally messengered notes -- the novel explores the war, friendships, and Juliet's writing life. At first, a book tour seemed to me too modern for 1946; the post-war postal service seemed too efficient; and the voices among the letter-writers seemed too similar. But very soon, I relaxed into those spirited characters and the touching moments that make this such a charming novel -- charming not simply in the adjectival sense of delightful, but the deeper, verbal sense of influencing and affecting.
B000YAA68C|5.0|What a great movie! Just a fun, charming, chick-flick love story! I cried my way through most of it.  I kept putting my husband in the place of Jerry, and my heart broke right along with Holly's! Just a very enjoyable movie to watch with the girls-if you aren't too embarrassed to cry in front of them! (because trust me...you will!). A great escape with great actors and some beautiful Irish scenery. P.S. I loved it!

B000002UAU|1.0|I had purchased this CD so as my wife turned 64 we could listen to the classic words of \\"Will you still love me when I'm 64?\\" Neither of the CD's delivered actually included the song with the original words. There were no words with the music. I was credited the purchase price back, but am puzzled why the version you stock is not the 'classic' original? Thank you if you can give any clarification.

0670020745|5.0|This is the best account from a stroke person I have ever read.  The author, although a doctor herself, shared her in-depth experience in a very readable manner.  It is important not only as a view of how the brain functions, but also a very important statement for anyone who knows anyone with a stroke: they are still present and aware, despite physical appearances. The messege is how much more we can learn, and don't ever give up on someone in that position.  Excellent information!

B000RPTQ1C|2.0|I could'nt wait to get my hands on Viva la Vida when it came out. Unfortunately, the album has been a big let-down. Something is wrong with this album. It plays like a stripped-down version of the Coldplay sound. Where are the guitars? Excessive reliance on synth and vocals make some of the songs play like the Chris Martin Band. The simple yet epic compositions that were the hallmark of X&Y are nowhere to be found. While there are a couple of great songs(Lost and Viva) that show the band's willingness to innovate, the album as a whole is watered down, overly experimental, and lacks the cohesiveness and depth of its predecessors. I hope the band will regroup and put a lot more work into their next record.
1577312082|2.0|First, let me say that I love this book, but the audiobook version is very disappointing. I want to share this book with as many people in my life that I can, and my husband only listens to audiobooks, so I bought this for him. He doesn't like it at all, and I listened to it, it is very hard to hear the speaker, the tone of voice isn't very excited or animated at all, and I could not listen to it for very long.

B00005U1YO|5.0|The Chemical Brother's masterwork, Come With Us, deserves the Nobel Prize if only one were given for useful contemporary popular music.  CWU is a CONCEPT album about GENETIC ENLIGHTENMENT. Getting the subtext and understanding how the tracks cohere requires that it be understood as a companion piece to the work of Zecharia Sitchin, particularly THE 12TH PLANET.  CWU is one of the seminal cultural creations of the early 21st century, the \\"Rite of Spring\\" of our time    Come with us.  We see the light.  Bright and clear.

0060555661|5.0|The Intelligent Investor has helped me focus on the long term, to really internalize what sort of returns I should expect from my stock and bond investments and to temper my enthusiasm when the market gets exciting.  Graham writes clearly, uses examples that are easily understood, and makes his points in an understated style.  Though a bit dated -- Ben Graham met his greater reward more than thirty years ago and Jason Zweig focuses his commentary on the internet bubble and its aftermath -- the lessons set forth remain critical to value investing today.  Just buy and read (and re-read) this book!
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie is a really good! I recommend everyone to watch it. It had me do a lot of thinking like, \\"What if I were him?\\" I've watched it so many times. BUY THE DVD. You won't be disappointed.
B000002UD0|5.0|I don't know about this album.  Many of the songs just don't connect with me in the same way the ones from Imagine and Mind Games do.  Many of the songs feel like they were just slapped on here to give the public more of John Lennon's excellent music, which makes sense because he IS one of the best singer/songwriters of all-time, but it's disappointing the quality of the music isn't a bit higher.  I'd say the highlights would be the mysteriously beautiful \\"Bless You\\", the funky \\"What You Got\\", the jazzy \\"Whatever Gets You Thru the Night\\", the highly unusual and dreamy \\"#9 Dream\\", and the instrumentally pleasing \\"Beef Jerky\\".  So yeah, I still like the album a lot, but it could have been the best thing ever.
6303855474|5.0|this is a real great movie, which was very good. i recommend this movie for the entire family from ages 6 to adult. real good movie to watch with the family and friends. i rate this movie 5-stars. enjoy this movie with action after action. bluewildcat1968........................
B000068R1X|5.0|Let me tell you something about Ozzy Osbourne- even when he makes an album that doesn't rock as hard as the other ones, you can always ALWAYS count on excellent songwriting to make up for the lack of heavy guitar riffs.  That's the case with Bark at the Moon.    All the opinions that say the title song is the only worthwhile moment on the album is something I *completely* disagree with.  You also have the highly energetic \\"Centre of Eternity\\", and the tender ballad of 'So Tired\\".  You have the lyrically meaningful \\"You're No Different\\" and the upbeat vocal melody of \\"Now You See It (Now You Don't)\\".  You have it all.    Now let's talk about the guitar player, Jake E. Lee.  While he's obviously not as good as the groundbreaking previous guitarist that played on the two previous Ozzy albums, he can handle himself quite well.  In fact, several times I'm left completely convinced he's a really good guitarist, because I can hum many of the guitar solos from this album.  He knows how to make his solos melodic and interesting, which is something not many guitarists know how to do.  That makes him a good replacement.      Bark at the Moon is a CLASSIC album from the legendary Ozzy Osbourne.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|It's really that simple.    I didn't have to pay to see it, so I won in that respect.  I knew going in that it was a kid's movie, obviously, but Pixar can usually entertain adults as well as they can kids (I think The Incredibles is a perfect example.) but after about 50 minutes I just lost interest and could barely keep my eyes open; the only reason for not falling asleep is the beautiful Roger Deakins inspired visuals.    I think my problem with Wall-E is it's too simple, not as complex as The Incredibles or as interesting as Toy Story.  There are some messages here and there (we're fat and lazy, we're not paying attention to anything other than what is immediately in front of our face.) but these themes are so base and simple that I felt like the people behind the scenes had no faith in their adult viewers.    It's not anti-anything, really, and it's not an ad for Al Gore, that's obvious to anyone with a brain, it's simply a kid's movie with sparse and cookie cutter messages.
B000002B7U|5.0|The Ultimate Sin would be not bothering to give this great album a chance because it's not listed as one of Ozzy's finest moments.  Personally I like it a lot more than No More Tears because back in the mid 80's the spirit of heavy metal was in full bloom.  I know Ozzy was going through some personal problems at the time it was recorded, but honestly, it didn't really affect the music in a negative way if you ask me.  It's the same old \\"love him or hate him\\" Ozzy that's we've known for years.    It's funny how some people think \\"Shot in the Dark\\" is the only good song on here.  No way!  That means we'd have to ignore the ultra melodic \\"Never Know Why\\", \\"Thank God for the Bomb\\", and the flat out awesome \\"Lightning Strikes\\".  The title song is pretty good too.    \\"Killer of Giants\\" reminds me of \\"Fire in the Sky\\", and if you like that song from No Rest for the Wicked, you'll like this one as well.  It's songs like this that make Ozzy an excellent singer.  I don't care if he has a high pitched voice that drives some people insane- when he sings a song like this, with the meaningful war lyrics and everything, it makes him a very good singer.  You care about the lyrics, and you care about the way he sings them because you can remember the vocal melody.  He's a good singer.    \\"Secret Loser\\" is a classic.  It's like a heavy pop song that really sounds good.  I like this album a lot.  The guitar playing might be somewhat lacking in a couple areas, but it's seriously not enough for me to dislike it or anything.
0061537934|3.0|This sweet and witty novel is about a semi-professional racecar driver named Denny Swift.  It is the story of how he overcame many hardships and obstacles on his way to becoming a Formula One Champion. The clever part is that Denny's dog, Enzo tells this story through his dog eyes and his dog voice.  Enzo is smarter than the average dog, largely because he watches hours and hours of television and picks up an amazing understanding of the world, he not only grasps ideas, but is able to articulate very well his own thoughts about things like classic films, books, hospital and courtroom jargon, even philosophy.<br /><br />The Art of Racing in The Rain was a quick and easy read.  I'm not exactly sure why, but the first half, to me, was much more enjoyable than the second half.  Maybe by the second half I started to feel stupid, continuing to read a story told by a dog.<br /><br />Overall, it was a nice story.<br /><br />3 ½ stars
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This DVD motivated the HELL out of me to get my body right. I watched the DVD and bought his book the Encylopedia of Bodybuilding along with Steeve Reeves book and Franco Columbo's book. I studied and learned the principles and watched what they did and applied it in my life and it really helped me. I went from 172lbs to 206 lbs solid muscle, and right now im pretty jacked, trying to get to 215. Get the DVD and you will be really motivated!
B001BODXW6|3.0|Given that the last two System Of A Down albums basically belonged to guitarist Daron Malakian -- who, in a controversial move, took over the bulk of the vocal duties -- it should be no surprise that the debut album from Scars On Broadway (a new band consisting of Malakian and System Of A Down drummer John Dolmayan) does little to distance itself from an already established sound. The simple, catchy riffs coupled with even simpler and catchier rhymes and that faux-British accent that only Daron can pull off make up the bulk of their debut album. So perhaps one's enjoyment of this album is all hinging on how they felt about the last two System Of A Down efforts.<br /><br />Personally, I'm a bit divided on the issue. While I missed Serj's input greatly (enter the slightly underrated [[ASIN:B000TX7B5U Elect the Dead]]), I couldn't deny that the stuff Daron was doing was not without merit. If one thing can be said, it's that System Of A Down obviously got their catchy, kinky brand of pop from Malakian. Thankfully, he puts that to good use with Scars On Broadway. Despite the repetitiveness and seemingly simplistic nature of it, their self-titled debut is the kind of album that gradually creeps it's way up into your brain. First listen, I hated it. Second listen, it felt very average. After three solid listens, I found the insane hooks spinning around inside my head. Sure, it may sound like a catchier version of Amen (see: [[ASIN:B00004YSBU We Have Come for Your Parents]]) and Malakian's voice can get grating after fifteen tracks, but the hooks (at least, musically speaking) are there to make a listening worth repeating. Malakian's guitar skills have definitely sharpened a bit as well, and are aided by spots of keyboard and organs. Musically, the album is top shelf. The true downfall, though, lies in the lyrics and, again, the vocal performance. It's true that System Of A Down were known to write some inane tunes, but nothing as bad as, say, \\"Cute Machines.\\" In fact, otherwise solid tunes like \\"Kill Each Other/Live Forever\\" are hampered by utterly stupid, predictable lyrics. And when it's all driven home by \\"that\\" voice he does, it can be quite the turn-off.<br /><br />It's pretty much hit or miss. If you can forgive a poor frontman and appreciate the music behind him, Scars On Broadway will be worth the while. If you were a fan of Daron's work in System Of A Down, you'll find this is a worthy continuation. If you saw him as a distraction, then this won't change your mind. Despite the dumb lyrics, cheesy vocals and predictable rhymes, the music is there. Simply put, if you took out frontman Serj Tankian's vocals from \\"Mesmerize/Hypnotize,\\" you would have Scars On Broadway. Which leaves one to the conclusion that if Serj had been involved somehow, this would have been a most awesome System Of A Down album.lid tunes like \\"Kill Each Other/Live Forever\\" are hampered by utterly stupid, predictable lyrics.

0345501292|5.0|I've bought a wide range of books over the years. Sometimes I've regretted the purchase. That is certainly not the case with this excellent book on the Indiana Jones films. I would highly recommend it - unlike some movie based books, there is a lot of substance - the fact that both George Lucas and Steven Spielburg have contributed prefaces goes to show how well respected this book is by the very people responsible for the movies. You only have to hold the book in your hands and feel its weight to know that a lot of research went in to creating it.     I thought the book would be good, and was pleasantly surprised to find it even better than expected. If you enjoy the Indiana Jones movies then this would be a good coffee table book for you.    Won't give any information away, but some of the ideas that didn't make it to the big screen are quite surprising. Thankfully Spielburg and Harrison Ford managed to curb Lucas's enthusiasm for sci-fi. I hope that they make one more movie - as long as it doesn't involve any more aliens or CGI based action scenes! Somehow I doubt that it will happen though. So you're pretty safe in buying this book as the 'complete' making of!
0689877803|5.0|I love this series. The charachters are well developed, the vocabulary is rich, and the adventure is high, and it never gets boring. I reccomend this series for anyone between 12 and 18.
B000092T6M|3.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, but I was disappointed by this extended version because the added scenes actually detract from the movie instead of adding to it.  They also seem to be scenes that arbitrarily re-explain some of the plot points that have already been stated so that viewers not paying as much attention or who aren't the sharpest knife in the drawer can have their hand held in order to follow along.    Lastly, even though there is a whole disc of special features, neither disc has the Bryan Adams music video with him playing the piano in the woods like the VHS does!  Major disappointment.
B0006GANOQ|5.0|One of the most legendary of action movies (and deservedly so) \\"Speed\\" is a full-octane thrill ride bolstered by great performances and an unusually potent level of character interaction.  In revenge for the foiling of his plot to hold an elevatorful of hostages for ransom, a maniacal villain (Dennis Hopper) targets one of the cops who stopped him (Keanu Reeves) by launching a plot that makes him responsible for saving a busload of civillians.  With the bus wired with a bomb that will detonate if its speed drops below fifty miles an hour - intentionally making Reeves's attempt to board and save it a suicide bid - Hopper demands another ransom, thus going after revenge and profit in the same gambit.       As in most of the best action movies, the deck is really stacked against the movie's protagonist.  The bus can't slow down, it can't stop at red lights, it can't be refueled, and it's forbidden for anyone to try to leave the bus: with helicopter news crews capturing the whole thing live, Hopper can monitor events at leisure from his hideout.  Sandra Bullock plays Annie, a girl who ends up driving the bus after its original driver is incapacitated early on, and the great chemistry between her and Reeves is a big plus in the movie (that chemistry worked again a few years later in [[ASIN:B000HEWEE4 The Lake House (Widescreen Edition)]]).  Actually, the interactions among everyone on the bus play off very well and believable.  \\"Speed\\" features some of the more innovative action sequences for this kind of movie and succeeds in creating a good rush with them.  A film that compares well with the best \\"Die Hard\\"s and the first [[ASIN:B00004RFFY Lethal Weapon (Director's Cut)]], this is, needless to say, an essential for action fans, as well as one that even those who rarely go for the action movie should check out.
B0000691U1|5.0|Me, I am no expert in music. That said, I let my ears guide me. In my opinion this CD has no weak points. Whether it is the title track, or \\"Wig Wise,\\" which sounds to me like Thelonious Monk's \\"Well, You Needn't,\\" there are surprises lurking in every track. I barely recovered from \\"Caravan\\" before I heard \\"REM Blues.\\" Before that, I was already smitten with \\"A little Max.\\" Does anyone know if this was named for Max Roach? In fact, I couldn't be sure which version of the last two songs I preferred. \\"solitude\\" is great. Does anyone detect hint of Keith Jarrett's Koln Concert Part I on \\"Switch blade,\\" or, more accurately vice-versa?    Who doesn't like this CD? Maybe someone who really knows music and is not impressed because he/she can easily pick out the flaws. By I must point out that this CD made the list of 100 Best CDs ever. Even if this list is subjective, it shows that a lot of people like it.

B0017MO10U|5.0|Following on the release of The Ark of Truth, Continuum is the second Stargate SG-1 movie to come to DVD.  Unlike Ark of Truth, Continuum is not potentially weighed down by having to overtly tie up loose ends left by the series. While, in fact, it does tie up a few loose ends rather nicely it also does something else: it brings Stargate SG-1 full circle.<br /><br />The plot is classic SG-1: the last of the system lords Ba'al (played by the ever villainous Cliff Simon) is about to be executed with SG-1 and Jack O'Neill in attendance. Suddenly people start disappearing and SG-1 members Daniel Jackson, Samantha Carter, and Cameron Mitchell flee through the Stargate to a world where the Stargate never made it to America just before World War II thanks to Ba'al meddling with history. After facing alternate versions of people they know and being dismissed, Earth comes under attack from Ba'al, his queen Qetesh (aka Vala) and his first prime Teal'c.  The team must find out how Ba'al changed history and put it right...or else. Writer Brad Wright brings together two of the series' best threads: time travel and the threat of Goa'uld invasion together to bring the series not only full circle but what could also be called SG-1's greatest hits.<br /><br />One of Continuums biggest pluses is that it brings the original cast back together. Richard Dean Anderson appears once again as General Jack O'Neill and while he does not appear in the entire film, his presence his certainly welcome and makes for a great addition to the film. Also returning for this film is the SGC's original leader, General Hammond. The late Don S. Davis makes his final appearance as Hammond in the film's alternate timeline and while it's a shame that he doesn't know the team in those scenes, his appearance (like O'Neill's) is a welcome addition to the film.<br /><br />The big thrill of Continuum is watching familiar characters in the alternate timeline. It is here more then anywhere else that the film brings the series full circle. We get to see the Goa'uld system lords back together again even SG-1's first nemesis Apophis in a surprise appearance. On top of the alternate versions of Teal'c, Vala, Hammond, and O'Neill we get to meet alternate versions of Hank Landry and President Henry Hayes.  Landry is played masterfully by Beau Bridges who is able to make the lines between the \\"real\\" and alternate Landry's almost indistinguishable. Hayes, played by William Devane and last seen in SG-1's seventh season finale Lost City, is much the same as the \\"real\\" version we've met before; skeptical at first and then forced to face the incredible with a brave face. Their appearances are what separates Continuum from Ark of Truth and marks an improvement.<br /><br />The film also makes a fine blend of the cerebral and action sequences. While ostensibly an action story, Continuum also takes moments to explore, on the personal level, the effects of seeing a world and people you know be almost completely different.  Yet when the film needs action it has action from submarines rising in the Arctic, to dogfights and gun battles the film shows what SG-1 could be at its best: intelligent and yet action packed.<br /><br />The stand-out aspects of Continuum are the amazing location photography, special effects, and music. The location filming in the Arctic (done in below zero temperatures) is amazing, beautiful, and breathtaking all at once. Considering this is a relatively low-budget film it's an incredible addition and it makes the film feel even bigger in scope and scale.  Scope and scale are the purpose behind another one of the film's highlights: the special effects. From dozens (if not hundreds) of Goa'uld ships to dogfights and extensions and additions to sets, the special effects in Continuum continue SG-1's proud tradition of bring feature film quality effects to the small screen.  Then there's Joel Goldsmiths' score which like Ark of Truth evokes the epic feel of the film.  Each of these make Continuum stand head over heals above many of the direct-to-DVD sci-fi films released all the time.<br /><br />The special features should please any SG-1 fan. There are two excellent behind the scenes documentaries, one about the making of the film and one dedicated to the Arctic filming. The one on the Arctic filming is especially interesting for allowing one to see the challenges of filming in one of the most remote places on the planet. The big star of the special features is the commentary by director Martin Wood and writer Brad Wright. Their commentary reveal both the joy, hardships, and difficulties of bringing Continuum to the screen.<br /><br />Continuum is not only an excellent addition to SG-1 but brings the series full circle. From classic elements to the return of favorite characters and villains to outstanding photography, effects, and music Continuum takes what could have been a boring attempt to tie up the loose ends of the series and creates a action packed adventure.

B00009UW0N|5.0|Halloween. What a perfect title for a Horror movie. It's hard to believe back in 1977 that there had never been any movie, let alone a Horror film, that incorporated that title. And what good usage it got. Written, directed, and even musically scored by John Carpenter (with great assistance by then girlfriend Debra Hill), this was truly a film that brought Horror to it's roots, leaving an impact that only George Romero's Night Of The Living Dead did ten years earlier. Showcasing a deranged killer by the name of Michael Myers who in childhood murdered his sister in cold blood on Halloween night, only to escape his asylum to return to his Illinois home to hunt down babysitter (and eventually known little sister) Jamie Lee Curtis 15 years later, was truly an amazing film that never exploited the genre, keeping the imagination and terror flowing within the viewers mind rather than blatantly on the screen. For it's time it was the number one profitable independent film ever made, and after almost thirty years, it still terrifies and never grows old. A true classic film. Every single DVD collector should own it....<br /><br />But which one?<br /><br />Not in the sense of sequels, but rather in which version of the original should you add to your collection. You see, this film has had the DVD distribution rights by Anchor Bay Entertainment (now known as Starz), and they have re-released this classic now a total of six times. So I would like to compare the two most popular versions to see which one should be for you, the \\"Restored\\" or the \\"25th Anniversary\\"<br /><br />Starting with the \\"Restored\\" version, this DVD was authored way back in 1999. However, it was personally restored by Halloween original cinematographer Dean Cundey, trying to preserve as much of the look of it's original theatrical run. This version has been released a whopping three times. But for the film's \\"25th (2003) Anniversary\\", Anchor Bay remastered the film yet again for another release \\"Halloween 25\\", this time taking the remastering process in their own hands, something of which Cundey was not happy with. You see, comparing the two's video, you'll notice that each are different. One point is brightness and sharpness. In the Cundey version, overall picture is dark and not as sharp while for 25 the white levels have been raised and it's overall color saturation has been lowered. To me, while the original with it's dark blue hue running throughout looks good, at times it's hard to see certain shots in the dark. The 25th version has fixed that, even going as far as making the film look more natural. As for sharpness, the 25th beats it by far. Audio wise, each film seems on the same level, so a tie there, but it's the video that should be considered when purchasing: the Cundey-more true to the original film/the 25-a sharper, more realistic picture.<br /><br />Next would be the use of the disc space. Restored is one of those discs that wanted to cater to the early 2000's audiences of giving them both a widescreen and a fullframe on the same disc. Because of this, the bitrate is pretty small for both presentations. However, the 25th is a 2 disc set that only offers on Disc One the Widescreen presentation, and it's Divimax as well. But to be honest, it's bitrate isn't up to say Superbit quality. It's better, but with a total of four audio tracks to choose from, the entire dual layer disc is only used by 75%, and that other 25 could have went to more video bitrate, but alas it's not. But to me, the bitrate still is higher on the 25, not to mention it's compression is four years younger than Restored, so 25 wins again.<br /><br />Finally is Extras, Restored has a 30 minute documentary called Halloween Unmasked 2000, narrated by Twisted Sister's Dee Snider. Why is he on here than just being a popular fan, beats me. But on 25's second disc is a whopping 87 minute documentary called A Cut Above The Rest which expands on the original and gives much greater detail on the film. 25 also includes another ten minute featurette called On Location, going back to view all the houses and such that were used in the film that Restored does not include either. And if that wasn't enough, 25 has the original Laserdisc commentary by John Carpenter with additional vocals with Jamie Lee Curtis and Debra Hill. This might be the best extra 25 has over Restored, because it's got to be one of the most personal commentaries I've ever heard. Carpenter doesn't hold anything back, a must listen. And sure, both have the same trailers, TV Spots, and such, but again to me 25th Anniversary wins this one too.<br /><br />But the main reason why I'm writing all this is because back in 2007, Anchor Bay decided to stop releasing the 25th Anniversary and instead re-issue the Restored version. Why, I'm not sure. Dean Cundey was never happy with 25, and maybe his name on the back of Restored's box was a selling-point, I don't know. Maybe the 25's cover was confusing buyers because it looks a little like sequel H20's version? But I do know for your money, the 25th Anniversary is still the best way to go. What's sad is to celebrate the 30th Anniversary of the classic film, Anchor Bay is yet again double-dipping it's audience by releasing a six disc collection featuring Parts 1, 4, 5, the NBC-TV edit, the 25 Years Of Terror special and a Blu-Ray version of the original. But again, both the DVD and Blu-Ray (BD version rumored to be a video-hybrid of both) are from the 1999 Cundey master (but the Blu does have the Cut Above special and commentary too). It would have been nice if the DVD was the 25 so fans could have both versions, but no, 25th Anniversary seems lost now.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you want the best overall 1978 Halloween package, go with the 2003 25th Anniversary Edition. More extras, a more realistic picture, and a commentary to die for. Ratings-wise then from me is:<br /><br />Restored: (8.5/10)<br />25th Anniversary: (9.5/10)<br /><br />Thanks for reading,<br />RedSabbathte featurette called On Location, going back to view all the houses and such that were used in the film that Restored does not include either.

B000IJ79WU|5.0|Nearly three decades after its original release, there is a radically new version of the near classic sequel Superman II. This version, headed up by its original director Richard Donner, presents the film the way it was originally intended. The question is does this version live up to both fans expectations and to the version originally released in 1980 by director Richard Lester? The answer is a definite yes.<br /><br />The biggest change in this so version is the addition of 15 minutes of new footage featuring Marlon Brando as Superman's father Jor-El. Originally deleted and replaced with similar scenes with Susannah York as Superman's mother, these new scenes are radically different in tone. This is mostly due to the Deepings of the relationship between father and son that was seen in the Superman The Movie. The scene were Clark loses his powers is a great example of this. There is genuine tension in the scene between the two characters as the son rebels against the father.<br /><br />But it is the other Brando scene that serves as the best example of this: the much awaited \\"re-powering\\" scene. Here the love of the father for his son is in seen in a way that is both dazzling and touching. It may also be the single best scene of the Superman franchise. The acting by both Reeve and Brando is amazing and it is a shame that the footage appears now after the death of both actors.<br /><br />But this is just the icing on the cake. The film is full of alternate/expanded scenes. Among these is the escape of the three Krypton villains (that is a vast improvement despite some bad CGI more on that later though), Lois jumping out of a window at the Daily Planet after figuring out Clark is Superman, a humorous expansion of Luthor's prison escape, the scene where Lois forces Clark to reveal he's Superman (that is also an improvement over the Lester scene despite being a screen-test). Also here are improvements to the final third of the film: a much more serious battle over Metropolis, a dramatic and virtully action-less confrontation at the Fortress of Solitude, the destruction of the Fortress at the hands of Superman and even an alternate ending.<br /><br />It is worth noting that there is a significant amount of Lester footage in this version (due to the fact Donner never had the chance to finish filming the entire movie). But even this footage, re-edited here, seems to also have been improved. Without a lot of the Lester humor the footage does not seem out of place.<br /><br />But this film is not perfect of course. The films biggest flaws are in its new CGI effects, its sound, and its music. The new CGI shot don't really ever match the original footage and at times it is way too obvious (the scene where Non goes flying after Superman punches him during the Metropolis battle is a perfect example of this). It is surprising that the original effects out shine those of the original effects of nearly three decades ago.<br /><br />The sound and music is also another issue. The voices don't always match due probably to the age of the recordings. The voices are sometimes different in scenes were dubbing never happened and it is at times obvious. The music, reused almost entirely from John Williams score to Superman The Movie, works very well. But there are times when it doesn't work and seems out of place. It's a shame that he wasn't brought back to re-score the film. But these problems are not enough to bring down the entire film.<br /><br />Overall, Superman II - The Richard Donner Cut may well be the definitive Superman film. When compared to Richard Lester's original version this film outshines and surpasses it. This film was meant to be, as it now is, the true successor to the classic Superman the Movie and it even surpasses it in terms of sheer quality.

0765356139|4.0|It's a good book... but seemed a bit more like a lead up to the next installment than a stand alone. I enjoyed the development of the characters, but it seemed to move a bit more slowly than the first novel.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is probably the best miniseries ever.  From my 97 year old father to my 20-something nieces and nephews, everyone has been absolutely mesmerized by this series.  It's beautifully acted -- the casting could not have been better -- and the filming is brilliant.  I cannot say enough good things about \\"John Adams\\"
B00005MP58|5.0|Rarely do I call anything a \\"Masterpiece\\", but this is truly that.  I am not one for period movies and wasn't sure what to expect.  I must admit that I watched this in part, because it was regarded so highly in the book, \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", which was loosely based on Jane Austen's book.    This beautiful story is brought to life on screen in such an amazing way.  The casting is absolutely wonderful as are the costumes and the scenary.  It seems that they truly were able to capture that period on time on film, flawlessly.    Jennifer Ehle is amazing.  She's stunning, clever and charming and I can't think of anyone better to perform that role. It was so memorable. Collin Firth really defines Mr. Darcy.  His range of emotion is absolutely wonderful.  It's not even the words he speaks, it's the non-verbals that really make it.  Stellar performance.    The remaining casting was fabulous as well.  Particulary Elizabeth's parents, her sister Jane and her youngest sister.      I can't say enough about this film.  An absolute surprise for me as I wasn't sure if I would even like this film.  It's well worth the time spent viewing as including all of the story, really added to the depth and made it even more enjoyable than a typical 2 hour movie.    I will be watching this movie again and again in the future.  It's one of my top favorites of all time.    As for the quality of the DVD.  It's fine and what I would expect for a $23.99 2DVD set.  No complaints.  I may upgrade to the special ediation version in the future because of the good reviews.  I am certainly happy with what I have though.....    This is one of just a few movies that I have in my video library and a great add......

B00000IHC7|5.0|Beginning with the previous year's \\"Photo Finish\\", people often refer to this era of Rory's music as his arena rock period, and in turn received some criticism for it. Though not as diverse in styles as his early albums, \\"Top Priority\\" is so full of clever hooks and great riffs, it should be appreciated for what it is and not criticised for what it's not.<br />\\"Follow Me\\" is such a great opening track, a real catchy rocker and adrenaline rush that sets the pace for the remainder of the disc. From there Rory launches off with a collection of some of his best rockers, \\"Key Chain\\", \\"Bad Penny\\", \\"Philby\\", the smoldering blues of \\"Off the Handle\\" being the highlights. Also found here is the original version of \\"Public Enemy #1\\", another really brilliant gem of a rocker, although I personally love the alternate version found on the \\"Calling Card\\" CD even more. The bonus cuts are great too, especially \\"The Watcher\\" which features Rory playing some surf-style guitar in the tradition of Dick Dale and includes some rare studio experimentation by Rory on his vocals. It may actually be my favorite cut on the entire CD, such a clever and original rocker. \\"Hell Cat\\" is one of those tunes by Rory that often is dismissed as being too conventional. Yes, the tune itself is pretty average as far as chord changes go, but if you're familiar with Rory Gallagher, you know that his approach to any song he ever recorded is passionate and sincere. It's a high charged, revved up rocker and delivered with a conviction and a certain element of surprise that only Rory could give it, whether it be a certain way he'll phrase things in his vocals or in his guitar, you'll never catch him going through the motions. An uncompromising brilliant talent, Rory was. \\"Top Priority\\" is one of his best.

I was also thinking ... this is the bridge between \\"round about midnight\\" and \\"kind of blue\\" ...we can not mistake the way!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B00133KFGW|5.0|For all those who think this movie was about music, or another orphaned \\"Oliver Twist\\"-- YOU HAVE ALL MISSED THE POINT! This movie is the best depiction of a life being led by the Spirit of God that resides in all of us. A life pregnant with giftedness, purpose, and brilliance, as I believe all of our lives are. This movie beautifully depicts what can happen when you cut through fear, doubt, sadness, feelings of abandonment or unworthiness or whatever negative cloud that tends to hover over our lives as humans,  If we can defeat those spiritual enemies and approach life with the faith and innocence of a child as Jesus suggested, allowing ourselves to be guided by the truth and wisdom that God placed in us upon our conception and embrace our divine giftedness, we would all see miraculous and unimaginable things happen in our lives! This movie showed the mother, father and child listening to and following their intuition (which I believe is the voice of God)and allowing themselves to be led to the life God desired for them.  If anyone is low on faith, or has trouble understanding what being in relationship to The Father actually looks like, THERE IS NO OTHER MOVIE FOR YOU! and those, (like me) who periodically need to be reminded of the glorious and awesome nature of God's love-- this movie is one for the collection.

0316113506|5.0|With Eric Hagerman, John Ratey has written a book in which he explains  -- in layman's terms (to the extent that is possible) -- how physical exercise can \\"supercharge [provide a `spark' to] mental circuits to avoid or overcome stress, sharpen thinking, lift mood, increase memory...and much more.\\" Obviously, these are all highly desirable results to achieve. Alas, many children as well as adults are out of (physical) shape, do not eat properly, and continue under severe stress to meet their obligations.  The implications of what Ratey explains and recommends should be of special interest to young adults, their parents, school administrators, teachers, and coaches as well as to business executives who are responsible for the performance of those whom they supervise.<br /><br />Here are some of the questions to which he responds:<br /><br />What are some of the most common misconceptions about \\"the brain-body connection\\"?<br /><br />What in fact is true?<br /><br />How can aerobic exercise physically remodel our brains for peak performance?<br /><br />Why is physical exercise the best defense against addiction, aggression, ADD, menopause, and even Alzheimer's?<br /><br />What are the most significant revelations of a fitness program sponsored by the Naperville (IL) public school district in which more than 19,000 children participated?<br /><br />Why should such a program (with necessary modifications) be made available to other school children?<br /><br />In the absence of such a program, what can parents do to increase their children's physical exercise? What sacrifices (if any) must be made to accomplish that?<br /><br />At a minimum, how frequently should we exercise...and for how long?<br /><br />What are the benefits to be gained even from minimal exercise?<br /><br />All of Ratey's observations and recommendations are research-driven, supplemented by his own personal experiences. He seems to be on a mission (one that is commendable) to do everything he possibly can to broaden and deepen public awareness of the consequences of obesity, lethargy, and indolence but also, more to the point, to provide reassurance that even a modest increase in physical exercise can have substantial benefits, not only in terms of improved health but also increased achievement and consequent pride in the classroom as well as in the workplace...indeed in every realm of human life.<br /><br />Those who share my high regard for this book are urged to check out Ratey's A User's Guide to the Brain: Perception, Attention, and the Four Theaters of the Brain and John Medina's Brain Rules: 12 Principles for Surviving and Thriving at Work, Home, and School (Book & DVD). It is worth noting that everything that Ratey recommends is consistent with the various \\"rules\\" that Medina identifies and discusses, notably #1 (\\"Exercise boosts brain power\\"), #7 (\\"Sleep well, think well\\"),  #8 (\\"Stressed brains don't learn the same way\\"), #9 (\\"Stimulate more of the senses\\"), and #12 (\\"We are all natural explorers\\").  How simple it seems: Eat right and get lots of exercise and sufficient rest. If you do, you will reduce stress and nourish your curiosity.

B0000032LS|5.0|This may be heresy, but I've always felt the music for this film was far superior to the film itself.  I think the experience of the film is better than the film itself.  Truth be told, the film is rather boringly directed, clumsily staged, and if it wasn't for the soundtrack, it would have been forgotten about.  Luckily, Richard O'Brien's soundtrack is awesome, tuneful, and never gets tiring on the ear.  It's justifably a cult item, and while I've listened to the soundtrack more times than I can remember, I've only seen the film once (on VHS).  Even the lesser known songs are still great (like Over at the Frankenstein's Place and Eddie).  The classics are awesome, with kudos going to Hot Patootie, Bless My Soul and some tune called The Time Warp.<br /><br />I still would like to see the film in a theater, mainly for the Rocky Horror experience and to sing along with songs I really dig, not because it's a great film.  Get the soundtrack, and once in a while, crossdress and see the film in a theater.
0307269965|5.0|This is a spectacular, beautifully written novel. I bought this hardcover edition because I wanted to read the introduction by Frank Kermode. It offered a lot of background information pertaining to the novel, as well as references to previous editions and a timeline of the author's life.   The story itself is very intriguing. Containing all the elements of a tragic love story-forbidden love, a love triangle, betrayal, and death, I found myself hooked from the first chapter. What I found most intriguing was the second conflict-Charles' struggle with his own spirituality while he spent time at Brideshead. Although I found the text easy to read and  understand, I still wouldn't call it a \\"beach read.\\"   This is one book I will recommend to all my literary friends and will pick up time and time again. Although it may not be for everyone, I hope you enjoy this book as much as I did.
B0000CDL93|5.0|If you jettison the politics of this movie (and Stone's reputation as a muckracker), and simply look at JFK as a film, it's arguably Oliver Stone's best film and it is absolutely rivetting.  It's a masterpiece of cinemtography, editing, writing, and performances.  I've only seen the initial 189 minute theatrical version, and that film is my favorite Oliver Stone film.  Stone's scope of this project is incredible.  He not only makes an epic about the JFK assassination, but he makes it so fascinating and enthralling that you marvel as his talents as a filmmaker.  The cinematography here is astounding.  Robert Richardson shoots in 35mm, 8mm, and 16mm, color, black and white, tinted color, tinted black and white, and it all blends seamlessly.  The editing on this monster is also a marvel (it deservedly won an Oscar for editing).  The film has a ton of cuts (something in films I don't like), but Stone and his editors do wonders with it.  The performances deserve special mention as well.  Costner is very effective as Jim Garrison, the New Orleans prosecutor who believed in the conspiracy of JFK's assassination.  Costner does a New Orleans accent very well, much better than his rather pathetic \\"English\\" one for Robin Hood:  Prince of Thieves.  There are numerous cameos in the film, but they don't feel like cameos.  Stone manages to make each actor/character unique and interesting.  It never feels like star spotting.  Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland, Joe Pesci, and Ed Asner (as a right wing demogagoue, which is funny considering Asner is a very left wing liberal) are standouts in a magnificent cast.<br /><br />When you watch this film, think of it as \\"Stone's interpretation of the JFK assassination\\".  There are numerous discrepancies here (such as Garrison meeting with Mr. X, played by Sutherland.  That never happened), but if you look at this film strictly as a film, it's remarkable and worthy of the accolades it has received over the years.  It's one of Oliver Stone's most memorable films, and a reminder of what a great director he can be when he's on.of Oliver Stone's most memorable films, and a reminder of what a great director he can be when he's on.

1400032717|5.0|Most of the reviews here judge Haddon's book on the basis of what it \\"says\\" or shows about autism (or asperger's syndrome), as if it were educational fiction. That doesn't seem the most pertinent criterion to judge fiction to me.    \\"The Curious Incident\\" is a magnificent book for several reasons.    1. It is a masterful story. The couple of \\"grand revelations\\" about Christopher's life are shocking and at the same time entirely believable - and they make the story move. I agree with one of the other reviewers that the ending is somewhat arbitrary, but again it's totally believable. The characters became more and more dense for me while I was reading, so as a story it's not an intellectual exercise.    2. This novel is so packed with suspense that it reads like a genuine thriller. I'm not going to reveal anything that happens, and you shouldn't be misled by the word \\"thriller\\" (no serial killers or zombies in this one). But just the description of a simple train ride through Christopher's (autistic) eyes is one of the most suspenseful passages I've read in a long while. I read this book in one sitting and at every page I wanted to know what would happen on the next one.    3. It's terribly funny. Christopher has a way of looking at things that is perfectly logical in one way and unsettling in another. His dead pan remarks often made me laugh out loud. His way of introducing elements that are irrelevant for us but entirely to the point from his own perspective (\\"this is another description because Siobhan [his teacher] said I should do descriptions [in the book he's writing].\\"), up to and including mathematical problems (formulas included), adds to the fun and the surprises.    4. It's moving. Here's this 15 year old kid, trying to understand the world, to be a good kid, to come to grips with some pretty awful things that happen to him, and doing all this with a strength, a morality and a logic he seems to find entirely within himself. As a reader you constantly shiftbetween feelings of admiration and of compassion, and if you don't have wet eyes when, almost at the end, Christopher narrates his favorite dream, you'll probably never cry when reading a book. Still, it's not a sentimental book at all: see points 1 to 3.    And lest I forget: for the first time ever, after so many newspaper articles and explanations, I do feel I've understood a little bit about autism too.

B0017XOF5A|5.0|First, let me preface this by saying I hardly, if ever, write reviews--especially for movies. And also that I am going to leave out any and all spoilers when it comes to the movie itself, with the exception of it's very general plot. For those of you who have, for some reason, not bought this movie yet.<br /><br />When I first heard that this movie was going to involve time travel and an alternate reality, I was skeptical just like you. But I must say that the team really came through on this movie in waulity, writing, and even directing.<br /><br />Martin Wood is not my favorite Stargate director, but he did a really good job on this movie.<br /><br />Where this film shines through most is in the interaction and dialogue between the characters. This movie delves deeper into the characters of Samantha Carter and Daniel Jackson than any full season of the television show. Also, Jack's brief part in the movie was well done, and he was, of course, just as funny as always.<br /><br />The real star of the movie, though, was Cameron Mitchell. Those of you who think that the show lost something with the departure of Jack O'Neill may find that surprising. But this film does something that two seasons and another movie were never able to do. It allows Mitchell to come out on his own as a character. He finally falls into place as an important central character and steps out of Jack's long, daunting shadow.<br /><br />I won't say more than that because I don't want to ruin anything for the fans.<br /><br />I'm obviously not very good at this, so I'm going to end this simply by saying that this is a very good Stargate movie and it is better than Ark of Truth, which was somewhat limited by the pure amount of plot points it had to cover to satisfy the fans. I was extremely happy with it. My only complaint now is that since it was an alternate reality story, it didn't sate my SG1 craving! I wanted to see the team together working a problem throughout the movie, like they were on a regular mission. I miss that, and episodes with the whole team working together were precious few during the final two seasons.<br /><br />Someone tell me there will be another movie!<br /><br />If you are a Stargate fan, this movie will make you happy. There are plenty of tasteful cameos--one in particular that knocked my socks off a little--and more than one reference to obscure Stargate trivial, but I watched it with a friend who knew nothing about Stargate and afterwards he made it a point to tell me how much he enjoyed it and he is now going to make it a point to watch the show.<br /><br />So, is the movie good? Yes. It is. It really is great. Buy it, rent it, watch it. That's the only way we are going to get another one, I think.the whole team working together were precious few during the final two seasons.    Someone tell me there will be another movie!

B000025H0Q|5.0|This is my favorite Drake record. All 3 of his albums are easily 5 stars albums but this one is the most upbeat and thus can be listened to fairly regularly while the other 2 especially Pink Moon can only be taken on a song by song basis for me.    1. \\"Introduction\\" 3/5  2. \\"Hazey Jane II\\" 5/5  3. \\"At the Chime of a City Clock\\" 5/5  4. \\"One of These Things First\\" 5/5  5. \\"Hazey Jane I\\" 4/5  6. \\"Bryter Layter\\" 5/5  7. \\"Fly\\" 4/5  8. \\"Poor Boy\\" 4/5  9. \\"Northern Sky\\" 5/5  10. \\"Sunday\\" 4/5
B000V6BE6M|5.0|It's wonderful having the entire musical experience available along with some of the composers ideas about what he was communicating.  The only shortfall from my perspective is that there are no words provided for all the lovely songs in elvish etc.
6304480415|1.0|This video is not usable.  There is a lot of static/background noise; the picture rolls vertically on a continual basis.  We tried the video on more than one machine,  We do not have this problem with any other videos in our collection.  We would like a replacement or a refund.  Thank you....LJSumption
B0012Q732O|2.0|The cover says that this \\"is an eye-filling tale of the first hero (Steven Strait) who sets out on a bold trek to rescue his kidnapped beloved (Camilla Belle)...\\"  And so on.  Well, Camilla Belle was indeed something to look at and I could understand why our hero wanted her back, but this movie was just a mess.  Forget historical inaccuracies.  The ending is what ruined this for me.  I saw it coming when the heroine got shot and miles away, the witch was deep  in thought.   I kept saying..Out loud I think..Please!  not that. Please, don't... and then they did.  Yes the rest of the movie wasn't very good, although there were some pretty cool adventure scenes like in the swamp or reeds or whatever it was, but that ending.  Why ruin a pretty decent movie with some kind of new age mystical crap?  I gave this movie 2 stars.  Even without the horrible ending, I think 3 would have been a stretch.  Maybe a target audience of 13 year olds and younger could enjoy this film.  I could not.  If you must watch it, rent it.  Not a buy!
B000069KGM|4.0|this album is phenominal - except for one song if you want to call it that. i don't care if it was 1969 or 'hendrixesque' sounding, 'free form guitar' was the worst, most offensive sounding ear splitting and shattering piece of $%&*+!@ i have ever heard !!!!       Chicago should be in the hall of fame by leaps and bounds - but 'free form guitar' could easily replace waterboarding in getting terrorists or other prisoners to break and spill their guts, almost literally !!!!!!!!!!!
B000I2J6K0|5.0|I love this workout video.  I did not do yoga or pilates workouts before, I liked run or play basketball and volleyball to get my exercise.  But once I found out I was pregnant, I needed a new exercise to stay healthy.  I found this and loved it!  She's talks about what you should and shouldn't do when and before working out, which was great being pregnant for the first time.  Also, has a workout with a partner which made my husband feel like he was more involved in the pregnancy.  The main exercise has a warm-up, workout and a cool down that lasts about 40 minutes and another 20 minutes with a partner.  I have recommended this to my sisters and friends that are pregnant.
B000QQH4YS|5.0|I just received the DVD version from Amazon.com, some are commenting on<br />the Blu-Ray for some reason. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it is in fact a Steelbook case. It's really cool, I own just about every release of Robocop and \\"case wise\\" this one is the best.
0688170528|5.0|I wouldn't say this book will become a \\"classic\\" or anything, but I found myself without the strength to put The Pact down. In my opinion, the story is both clever and enthralling. As a whole, although the novel is a love story, it is not a cliche romance. The whole time I felt as though I was watching a suspensful movie. I just finished the book this morning and now I find myself depressed. I want more!
0446677450|1.0|With the fertility rate (birthrate) declining all over the world, including the United States, it doesn't take a genius to understand that house prices only go up when the population is increasing.  When it is stable or declining, prices will stagnate or decline, and the easy money will be gone.<br /><br />With our open border with Mexico, we depend upon millions to come to the US legally and illegally.  If that ever stopped, you'd see the demand for housing dry up in a hurry.<br /><br />The best investment is an investment in YOU.  Education, education, education.  That will matter the most in the long run.  As they say, if you want to be rich, become a doctor.<br /><br />I've skimmed the book and agree that it isn't worth the purchase price.  Save your money for real books on personal finance, not this book.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth Brooks is also another Icon in country music just like George Strait but in his own right of course. Any fan of country music should add this to their collection. Garth mixes in a little old in with a little new and it turned out to be a surperb recipe. Some of my favorite songs on here are Friends in Low Places, Callin Baton Rouge, The Dance, Good Ride Cowboy, If Tomorrow Never Comes, Rodeo, & Shameless. More than a Memory is another great song to hear if yall havent already that Garth has came out with recently. That song showed that Garth can still kick butt even with a 3-5 year absence. I really enjoyed this collection of songs. Most of his greatest hits are on here. The new remake of Workin for a Livin is also on here as well with Huey Lewis. Great collection of Garth songs. A true Masterpiece. You even get a 3rd cd which some of Garth's music videos are on so that defiantly added more to the cd's. Once again, a Masterpiece.    I highly recommend on getting this, for any country music fan. Great collection.
B00008976Y|5.0|I've finally seen all three films of the trilogy, and Blue is probably my least favorite, but that's considering I gave the film five stars.  Really, all three films are outstanding and I couldn't recommend them more highly.<br /><br />However, as an animal lover, I was bothered by Julie's 'solution' to the problem of finding a mother mouse and her tiny babies, in her closet.  I agree that few people want to find a mouse family in their house, but to dispatch the neighbor's cat to kill them all was cruel and unnecessary.  She could have left the mice until they were old enough to trap and release, she could have moved the family in a suitable 'house' outside, or she could have put them in a cage and allowed the family to grow until they could be safely released.<br /><br />We treat other creatures in a too cavalier manner.  These animals are living creatures and deserve to live their lives out without human interference in such a sense as Julie did.  This bothered me thoughout the film.<br /><br />At least in 'Red' Kieaelowski allowed that the German Shepherd dog, who was 'run over' by the female protagonist Valentine, survived and was treated with love and respect by her owner.  At one point, it showed that the puppies survived and were doing well.<br /><br />Other than that, I loved Blue and plan on buying all three films on DVD.  Blue was very well acted and the music was just fantastic.  The soundtrack to Blue is available here and I plan on buying that as well.  The music is used very effectively.  It intrudes in a way that I felt the Julie character (who was married to a composer and helped edit his work) was just struck by the powerful nature of the music, perhaps as she had envisioned it or as she shared her husbands obsession with it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  Buy this; you will not be disappointed!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This is possibly one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Completely unexpected. A must see!!

B0017MO10U|4.0|This was a wonderfully shot, produced, written, and edited \\"episode\\" of the great series SG1.  It was a little longer than a TV episode but didnt seem as long as a movie.  I bought it on Bluray for $29 and was pretty impressed with the quality.  There were many production/set items that really jump out at you as being, well, cheap.  Like the lack of snow on their coats when they slide and exit the ship in the beginning; although the whole Arctic photography was outstanding.  Then there was the 1929 ship, which was sitting way too high in the water to be carrying the chapa eye, but then that would have made the storyline more difficult.  Then there was the..........well you get the point.  But, hey, that's what a small, Canadian budget gets you.  The acting was outstanding from everyone.  Most notably from Valla, Te'alc, and Mr. Bridges.  Samantha seemed not too interested and Col. O'Neil was eye candy for old timer fans, but they didn't make the film any weaker.  Overall, this was a great addition and I hope they keep coming, straight to DVD/BRD.

Wanted to keep a copy to read again and to share.   It is a \\"book for the ages.\\"   Frankl not only survived the horrible conditions of the Nazi prison work camps,but gives whoever will read his words great hope for the overcoming of whatever evils may beset us as human beings.
6304401132|5.0|everything about my purchase was great. i recieved the vhs tape promptly. the seller even wrote me personally and thanked me for my purchase and taking the time to give him a rating. i thought that was nice, since ordering online can be so impersonal.
0920668372|5.0|I love this book. I read it to my daughter alot when she was young.  Just purchased this book for an older mom at church and her son. She said when they hang up the phone now he say Love you forever. I belive him.
B00000IREA|5.0|I have to say I loved this old campy movie. Brought back memories of being in the service. Plus the movie itself is a hoot, the \\"Special\\" effects were so special, makes me wonder how it would be done today. Just wish I could find the European version. Anyway I recommend this just because they don't make movies like this any more.
B00005JN0T|5.0|this is a movie you can whatch over and over, you will never get tired of the non-stop action. the whole plot in this movie is very intriguing.
B00116GHMM|2.0|1st I downloaded this album of a torrent site and fell in love with the whole album so naturally I bought this record for my collection, enhanced must means its a totally different master then the cd version. The low end(bass) seems like it was cranked to the max and sounds distorted and indistinct from the mid. Great band and album, terrible vinyl!
032147404X|5.0|Dear fellow amazon.com shoppers,     I bought volume 1 and volume 2 of Scott Kelby's books together with my Pentax K200D. As a photo-enthusiast and DSLR starter I really enjoyed reading this two books. Both read very easy and takes you in a fast pace through the basic and intermediate know-abouts of professional digital photography. Volume two picks up right where volume 1 stopped, so both books actualy make 1 big total package. The author doesn't bother you with too technical explanations but takes you with him on a shoot as a friend would do. Every chapter he describes how to best do this and that. Starts with landscape shooting, all the way to sports, macro, weddings, nighttime shooting etc. Every chapter is dedicated to a certain discipline and gives you more usefull information than you'll be able to remember the next time you go out on a shoot. So the book grows with you as your experience grows. You read the chapter again, ie. Landscapes, and hey: i forgot about this and that, let me try that the next time when I'm in the mountains. When you control every discipline described in these books, then and only then you can move on to more technical and specific books. The chapters read very fluently with a great deal of humor and pragmatic 'aah, so that's how they do it' moments.   For the price, get both at once as you really need both to get going!     Good luck improving your photografic skills!
B000UFAURI|5.0|I think it's funny that people's opinions can be so all over the board. While  I like a lot of the old Foo stuff, I thought this album was awesome. There's not a single song that I skip over and several songs that I just can't get enough of. Loved it!
006085880X|4.0|A friend of mine told me i should read this book.  When I looked at the book I've sees the title \\"The Pact\\" and it says \\"a love story\\". THat itself didnt make me wanna read it because i thought this would be just a regular love story and I'm not into those \\"boring\\" books.  My friend kept asking me if I read it already so i thought i give it a try and i must say i am very surprised. I did not expect this book to be the way it was. The story about Emily and Chris is very touching but also something to learn from. I also think that the story was very realistic and that made the story so good. It is written well and its  very intense. I highly recommend it. ThIs is a book I will not forget.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The controller is great, if it were 5 years ago.  It's not horrible but compared to good ergonomic controllers today, Sony needs to update this dated design ASAP.  They addressed the 3rd major flaw which was the missing rumble, so there's hope they will fix the rest of the problems.      Spend a few hours playing with an Xbox 360 controller and you'll see what I mean.  The 360 controller has a \\"in the slot\\" feel that is just natural and comfortable after many hours. Too bad the 360 controller, \\"best controller ever made\\", is paired to the worst console ever made, I'm on my 3rd 360, lol.    Problem 1:  Non-user replaceable internal Li-ion battery.  Before you get all huffy and puffy about this, I am aware you can take apart the controller to replace the battery.  But if you have to take apart something (and need instructions) to replace the battery that ain't \\"user replaceable\\" in my book.  Sony should go the AA battery route. Rechargeable AA batteries are plentiful, have universal applications, and can go through 2x the charge cycle as Li-ions before noticeable degradation of performance.  Also with the new Ni-MH Low Self Discharge (LSD) batteries (like the Sanyo Eneloops) the batteries can hold their charge, which was a big reason why manufacturers liked to use Li-ions.  Contrary to what you read Li-ions only go about 400-500 full charge-discharge cycles before they start fading vs. over 1000 for the LSD rechargeables.  I also read people complain about the weight of controllers, what?  How weak can you be to be complaining about a controller being too heavy at a few ounces???  I like a controller that feels solid and the original Six-Axis was way to cheap feeling. People also complain that the battery compartment in the middle of the back of the 360 controller \\"gets in the way\\". Um, how exactly do you hold the controller for it to get in the way? Like a fan or something? Whatever.  Sony want to make it difficult to change the battery in hopes that you will just buy another controller. Don't let them get away with this.    Problem 2:  Erogonomics, it's just getting old. Not horrible, but not great.  And for $55-$60 you're paying for a high end controller which you deserve but instead you're getting a mediocre one.  It looks nice but that's about it, unless you really need that Sony label.    -The D-pad needs to be circular, games like Street Fighter work better with the circular pads, why do you think Hori makes dedicated Street Fighter controllers with circular pads for the Playstation?  -The analog stick needs to be concave at the top (indented) instead of the convex (mushroom like top). It's too easy to slip.  -The trigger button should be like a gun trigger, slightly curved outwards and thinner so your finger can sort of wrap around it.  -The handles should be a bit rounder or thicker. It's too flat and you can't really grab onto the controller like you can with the 360/Nyko.  -The buttons are too flat. They need to be rounded so you can tap them from sharp angles.    Basically Sony needs to get off their duff and copy the Xbox 360's controller design. I can't believe they actually thought that boomerang controller design was good. You gotta wonder who is heading their controller design department.    Sony did a great job with the console, now they just need to make a controller that is worthy of the PS3.    I gave the lowest possible rating because of the price of this controller and the fact that Sony has been sitting on this design forever and not willing to improve on it.  Yes it was a great design when it came out many years ago, but now they have to get over themselves and realize they  need to make improvements. I've use this design since the original PS1 and loved it until the 360 came out.  There's much better alternatives out there at better prices.    The Nyko Zero (get the one with rumble) addresses all of these problems and is the best controller for the PS3 right now. It has a few issues of it's own but areminor compared to the fundamental problems with the PS3's controller.  And it comes with a rechargeable battery pack AND a cover if you want use AA batteries and it's cheaper, go figure.    I'm probably going to angry response from the Sony faithful (I guess I am one too but I buy all the consoles) with this review but you really should try out the other controllers and not just for a few minutes. Buy one and see what you've been missing out on.
B00005R8GU|5.0|There are seminal moments in the arts when circumstances bring giants together in perfect alignment, and this album is one of them.  The cast could never be better than the one contained herein, with the huge blues voice of Muddy Waters leading the way, half-brother Otis Spann pounding out some of his most brilliant piano ever, Paul Butterfield blowing his harp as if nations rise or fall by his effort, Mike Bloomfield (not long for this world after this 1969 recording) spinning out black blues guitar licks in a faithful but trailblazing fashion, plus a killer rhythm section of Stax/Volt's Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn and Muddy's own Sam Lay on drums.      The songs are Muddy classics, from the thundering \\"40 Days And 40 Nights\\" to the braggadocio of \\"I'm Ready\\" to the oddly zen \\"Can't Lose What You Ain't Got\\" to the weary-but-wise \\"Standing Round Cryin.\\"  Great tracks that never made the original LP include \\"Love The Life I Live\\" and a live version of \\"Same Thing\\" that sets a new standard for simmering control under extreme pressure.      Long-short, Muddy never sang better, Spann and Butterfield are at the very top of their form, and if you can only have one blues album in your collection, this is hands-down the collection you need to have.  It has worn well for nearly forty years; it will serve as the standard for hundreds more.

B0017MO10U|4.0|It felt more like an episode than a movie. That certainly isn't bad the fact it was another entertaining movie, but it is bad in the fact we have to wait so long between movies. This was another closer episode. Last time it was the Ori, this time the last system lord, Baal. The story centers on Baal's symbiote being removed but then they find out it is another clone and the real one has impacted the timeline so that he can invade Earth. Good acting, sets, music as you would expect from a well produced series. Fortunately there were plenty of episodes during the series that left themself open to return visits. They either need to make the movies more like movies or better yet bring back the series. They obviously don't mind making the movies and they have had a break from the series grind for awhile. Whatever their decision I'm just happy to get either. Being a fan since the very beginning when it first started on Showtime, I look forward to the further adventures of SG-1. Good quality DVD but I had to play mine on a multi-region player to get it to work. It would not play on a standard DVD player. Great replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Ark of Truth\\" and \\"Stargate SG-1\\". - C. Luster

B001AG52AG|5.0|I think this is another one of these situations where either you read the book and you hate the movie (because it wasn't exactly like the book) or you didn't read the book and you love the movie (because it was a good movie).<br /><br />I didn't read the book.<br />I thought the movie was excellent.<br /><br />I rented this from Amazon Unbox out of sheer lack of anything better.  I was expecting a cheesy kids movie, perhaps not unlike Narnia.<br /><br />What I got was a good story with fantastic special effects throughout and a whole lot more violence than I had anticipated.  I'm honestly surprised that they got away with a PG-13 rating.  No gore, but plenty of killings.<br /><br />All of the standard fantasy genre elements are there (strangely, this is why some people rated it poorly) -- you got your drunken warrior brought out of retirement to bring down a king and generally save the day; you got your evil-witch-type person, your good-witch-type person, your evil government workers, your easily fooled scholars and your mystical device that everyone wants in the hands of a girl.<br /><br />It's a winning formula and made for an enjoyable movie.  I give it 5-stars on the condition that they are making the next installment.  I would have to deduct at least 1 star, maybe 2 if they simply let it end with this one, which was clearly the intro to an intended series.
0321544080|5.0|The book is just perfect for me!  Great photographs, lots of talk about lighting and stories that is just long enough.
1400063515|3.0|Nassim Taleb has written a very enthusiastic book, and provides some very tasteful food for thought. The problem is, Taleb himself is far too pleased with his own work.<br />Talebs confidence in his own ideas helps him write a book which is easy and fun to read. For an economist, interested in the philosophical background of the science, he offers plenty of very interesting references. I will most certainly dig more into the thoughts of Karl Popper and Benoit Mandelbrot.<br />But Taleb's confidence also helps him make several rather banal mistakes. His main adversary is the statistician Gauss and his normal distribution. Taleb is right that many economists and financial analysts rely far too much on normal distribution. But figure 7 on page 238 reveals that Taleb himself does not understand the concept pretty good: \\"..as your sample size increases, the observed average will present itself with less and less dispersion\\".<br />His confidence also makes Taleb jump to conclusions and make banal errors (the French Maginot Line, the main line of defence built in the 1930s, was not built where the Germans attacked France in World War One). Taleb even goes in his own primary trap: the confirmation bias. Every little thing happening by chance is counted as evidence of his Black Swan theory. But the story of penicillin is famous just because it was sensational, not because it is the normal way of making major medical breakthroughs.<br />It is probably not worthwhile to read this book, although there are grains of gold in it. The book is written in the spring of 2007, before subprime. In a footnote Taleb is writing about the risk of Fannie Mae: it \\"seems to be sitting on a barrel of dynamite.\\" Touch&eacute;!
B00005JPY0|5.0|An epic action movie, a superbly acted ensemble piece, a dark crime drama, a rumination on the consequences of our choices and actions, and a story about a guy dressing up like a bat, THE DARK KNIGHT is all of these and more. Chris Nolan has created a work that will stand with THE GODFATHER PART 2 and THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK as sequels that best their predecessors emotionally and artistically. An astounding achievement that puts all other films based on the characters created in the comics and graphic novels to shame. BRAVO.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|I absolutely love Theory of a Dead Man. Each song is great, but I was really hoping to rock out, and this CD didn't do that for me. Too many slow songs.I really enjoyed their past CD's better. They had better variety.

B00166QJRU|5.0|As a huge fan of David Live and Stage, I was eager to get a copy of this and bought the vinyl on the day of release.  I have a copy of the semi-legit bootleg, but the sound quality of this official release is much better, much cleaner.  The David Live and Stage shows were much bigger productions than the 5 man band Bowie assembled for this '72 Tour.  This is the Ziggy band plus a pianist.  And Bowie, who was at the height of his powers in the early to late 70's, had a lot more great material to work with for Live and Stage.  But what Live Santa Monica lacks in polish, it more than makes up for with sheer energy.  LSM, reminds me of why I go to see live shows and what a rush a band that totally cooks can be.  Everybody was playing great, but Mick Ronson is really on fire, in spite of a couple of missed notes.    Song selection is universally great, but Width of a Circle, Queen Bitch, Life on Mars? are particular favorites.  A must have for Bowie or live rock music fans.
B001BMKOZW|5.0|When I listen to music I never listen to the album in order and I pay absolutely no attention to the names of the songs. This album is a perfect example of why I listen to albums that way. There is no begining or end to this album it just keeps on going awesome song after awesome song. You can't even get stuck on a song because the next song coming grabs your attention again. I most highly reccomend this album and I honestly don't own a SOAD album or Serj's album. I like there music just never bought it. I preordered this album. I was introduced to SCOB thru XM radio and then I checked out the Myspace page and Im hooked. Im glad I bought this album.
B0016AJU2C|1.0|Had I not been so happy to see Alanis finally released another album I would have been more careful to listen to the sample clips before downloading. I think this is the first time I've ever wished I could get my money back for music.    If you like what happens when a DJ gets ahold of a song and remixes it with a club beat, then you'll probably like this album. It seems like they decided not to wait for the DJs this time and just released the remixes first. Unfortunately I was under the impression that Alanis was growing in a less electronic, more introspective, more enlightened direction in recent years and expected something more along those lines. If you had that impression too, I'd advise you to keep waiting. Maybe we'll get lucky and she'll release an acoustic version in the future.    But if you're looking for something you can dance to, and you would rather have an artist's lyrics well hidden behind an overly-produced canned electronic club beat, then give it a try. You won't find anything unfamiliar here.
B000667GFK|3.0|Luis Miguel is extremmely proud of his Mexican roots and on this CD it shows.  Luis Miguel does a more than adequate job singing these traditional Mexican ballads.  It is a must have, for those who love mariachi music!
B0010X745K|4.0|After hearing bad reviews from friends I decided I better watch this movie, since I usually like what they dislike, it's a Sci-Fi thing. I was pleased with the entire movie, the suspence was good and the special effects were adequate. Although I won't give it away, the ending was brutal. Some people might find it ironic, it just made me feel like crap.
B000059T5O|5.0|So there is not much more that can be said about this album.  This is one of the most solid collections of Tom Waits renditions that you will find, almost as great as Tom himself.<br /><br />Better than any of the other tribute compilations and better than the Scarlett Johansson or even the Holly Cole renditions, although I must say that the Holly Cole ones are rather great as well.<br /><br />John Hammond is one of the moden greats in Blues and really has somethings to say and says them with love, heart and soul.  This album captures that with the brilliance that only Tom Waits could deliver.<br /><br />Buy it!
B000OD1OU8|5.0|The Bourne books by Ludlum do NOT follow the same storyline as the movies that share the same names as the books.  The Movies have Matt Damon and were edited for the screen (Ludlum's characters were retained where they fit into the storyline--for the most part).    That being said, the books were published long ago and are good reads.  However, if you expect an \\"extended\\" storyline from the movie, you will be disappointed (as I think the previous reviewer was).  Taken independently, the book is a wonderful read, and the reader will see a character whose difficulty trusting the government is spot on--as is the government's willingness to use people (as is evident in all of the books of this \\"type\\").    The characters in the books are more rounded (both good and bad), rather than just one-sided as portrayed in the movie(s)--usually what happens in a \\"book.\\"    I recommend this series so long as you do not expect a rehash of the movies, and the book gets a 5-star rating from me...
B0013FNC38|2.0|I was so excited to hear Jasons new CD! I have been a die hard fan for years! Seen him in concert 3 times! I love his sound and clever lyrics....but this CD does not live up to his others! I think he tried too hard or something. The Jason Mraz I fell in love with is not present in this CD. I am so bummed! Just wanted to warn you....It's very disappointing!
B0014KD46W|5.0|Steve still has it!  Not a whole lot of broken ground here, but solid music with great percussion, and classic organ. His voice is still as good as when he was with Spencer Davis doing \\"Gimme some lovin\\".  Nice surprise.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I was one of those watching the news of Amy's \\"drug habits\\" until one day I thought well what does Amy actually do.  So I watched some of the music videos on you-tube of early Amy Winehouse and have been hooked ever since.  She is thee Only one I listen to on my i-pod. Frank and Back to Black plus others that have not been recorded. That voice, it's the voice and range, it's raw, honest and addictive.  Stay with us Amy, your not done yet.  She is our Janis Joplin/Billy Holiday.
1569242739|5.0|Vegan or not, this book has got it goin' on. Not only is it fun to read (I've read the A to Z a few times!), the recipies are very accurate. I've had books and recipes from \\"celebrity\\" bakers, those who have even been featured on the famed Food Network, and their recipes were awful - they just don't turn out like illustrated in a regular kitchen. Now, if you'd like a recipe for 24 cupcakes that actually MAKES like ... FIFTY, then I can recommend a book from a young lady in NYC ...<br /><br />But really, this book is great. The recipes are easy and simple to make, and are infused with fun and wit to boot. These have got to appeal to even the biggest carnivores and baking-haters alike! I plan on making every recipe in the book, then doing a crash South Beach Diet ...<br /><br />One note: Definitely take the advice on the Golden Vanilla Cupcakes to use the margerine recipe. I would also recommend cake flour instead of regular flour. The oil recipe comes out a little denser than I'd prefer, but if you don't have margerine or cake flour, they're still vegan-ly delicious.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am not a big video workout fan because most are so cheesy or hard to follow for those of us born w/ no coordination.  Neither of these apply to this video.  The 30 Day Shred is designed to be done every day from what I understand but I just can't seem to fit that in.  But on the days that I do I get the greatest workout.  I was skeptical of 20 minutes being enough time to get a good burning workout.  She is a genius!  Lots of hard work in a little time and you truly feel worked out...and proud of yourself as you progress.  There are 3 progressive levels of work-outs.  She also has two assistants to show how to do the move to the max or a bit easier if necessary.  I can't say enough about this video.  There's no doubt that this video along w/ a good diet will create some awesome results!!  It's working for me.
0743298039|4.0|I found this book quite interesting. In the beginning, I struggled to hold on, as it started quite slow; however, once I got into it and started to feel Margaret, it turned out to be wonderful. Quality writing and a well-crafted story that left me, at some parts, guessing, only to \\"figure out\\" the wrong story. I very much recommend it.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD is a departure from their previous records.  It makes them a bit more progressive, the sound is a bit harder but very melodic.  If you are not a Coldplay fan, you will be after this album.  Highly recommend this record if you remotely like Coldplay.  I was surprised because I was not the greatest fan, but after listening to this, I would go see them live.  Great production.
B000F6IOC0|5.0|The first one was good but the second got even better! I went to the movies 4 times to see the second and went through a lot of anxiety waiting for the dvd. Their Myspace page had a comment by me every day. Some nights I could not sleep thinking about how much that love scene turned me on. Michael is the sexiest beast ever!!! I wanted him so bad!Well after this movie I bought the contacts, custom fangs, the suit, the boots, the corset and will get the sword soon. Proud to own both movies. I could not get enough! after watching it a million times I have calmed down a lot. SOOOOOOOOOO HOT!!!!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|It took a long time before a complete different style of \\"gay\\" movie is presented to us - and it is here today at last !  It is a very simple film - a very simple story line - and I think simplicity is the key success of this movie  No \\"couture\\" wardrobe - no bitchy attitude - know what I mean    For the rest you will have to get it to see what I mean
6304698623|5.0|I am proud to own this movie. The story is beautiful,deep,touching, huge. I am 25 years old and It made me cry like a little girl. I love it!
0930289234|5.0|As a young kid and into my adolescent years, I was a casual comic-book reader. I liked the Incredible Hulk, Spider-Man, and especially the X-Men. I never read tons of comic books, but every now and then I would pick one up to read in the bathroom. I had heard of Watchmen and had heard all of the hype surrounding it, but had never looked into it. Earlier this year, I was at a bookstore and just happened to see it out of the corner of my eye. I figured it would be more good bathroom reading material. I was amazed at how deep and mature this story was. The artwork is beautiful as well, and there are so many little things that an attentive and intelligent reader can pick up on. Needless to say, I spent more time than usual in the bathroom. Just recently, I saw there is going to be a movie remake. While the logical side of me knows it can't possibly re-capture the same magic contained in this book, I am so captivated by the effects in the trailer and the sheer possibilities that I know I will end up seeing it as well.<br /><br />Anyone who has any interest in superheroes or compelling storylines should pick this up.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I am not really a musical kind of girl but I did love this one. I am proud to own the movie, the soundtrack and I cannot wait to go see the play again! I can't get enough of the phantom at all! I watch almost anything with Gerard Butler he is the sexiest man ever!
B000PC6A3E|5.0|The blue ray format does a great job of making you notice things of movie shot with the really dark sequences the dark Knight is a great example.  This movie was great in a regular DVD but Blu-ray makes everything clear.  You notice things that you didn't notice, and for some reason it makes you pay attention to all the vibrant colors.  I highly recommend any movie in Blu-ray, and I can't wait for the Batman movie.  That is currently in theaters now to come to Blu-ray
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|I want to give it 5 stars but the fact that the ending and like 2 other minor things really pissed me off wont let me do it. The story would have been great if the king recognized the unfair mistake he made with the first boleyn girl. They made him so weak and stupid. The first boleyn girl gave him what he wanted and then he let's himself get used like a puppet by a stupid power hungry leech. This movie had super great potential. I loved the love scene and love story between the king and the first boleyn girl and then they riuned it ;-(
B001CD6FKI|1.0|Could not sit through this movie, found it an insult to my intelligence. Acting seemed stilted and fake from the beginning. Seemed superficial and aggravatingly ugly movie. I think I'll stick to watching the old movies for a while.
1400032717|5.0|This is a book that will stay with me for a long time and it is one I would  have everyone read, if I could.  It isn't so much that I \\"learned\\" about autism or Aspergers from it but the author's remarkable ability to capture the voice of this troubled but brilliant young man let me into his life as nothing else could.  I became his advocate and cheered at his successes.  I couldn't help but think how much more thoroughly he carried a thought through than I do and that was part of his problem.  He was way ahead of the rest of us and I can now understand how painful his life could be.  Yet the book was never heavy or sentimental.  In fact, it was quite light-hearted in a way.  To be able to write like that is truly a gift.
B000BAQ8A0|4.0|This is an excellent Barber, good orchestra and singing, but I gave it only four stars because I thought it strained too much for laughs and reminded me of the slapstick in the old silent films. OK this is a comic opera but that doesn't mean it can't be overdone. For the perfect mix of characters, singing and comedy, I still think the Rawnsley, Ewing one on Kultur can't be beat.
B0019Y8G9I|5.0|Not since the amazing encounter of Johnny Cash with Satchmo recently released on DVD [[ASIN:B000TLMWMY The Johnny Cash Show: The Best of Johnny Cash 1969-1971]] have I heard such a successful blending of two completely different musical styles, yet Willie and Wynton both have so much in common.   The merging of souls extends to the backing musicians as well - where else can you hear a country harmonica solo followed so seamlessly by a jazzy sax solo.   This session is all heart and a clear mutual love for those elements which are so common yet appear so differently in the two music forms, jazz and country.   The simple answer lies in the major common element, the blues.   Whether you love jazz or country or both this is the must have album for 2008.  When do we get 'Willie and Wynton ll'?
0375703764|5.0|Great book still haven't finished yet, but love it so far. A few bands I listen to wrote songs about this book so I had to pick it up to see what it was all about. It's very different from the way it is written and may get confusing at first but once you understand who is who it's a great book.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|This music has the capacity to alter ones consciousness and take it to the higher planes of tranquility.  Simply a beautiful masterpiece that should be shared amongst all Souls who yearn for something better than what is found in day to day life.
B000T5O48U|4.0|I am a huge Stephen King fan, and as we all well know, about half his books are destroyed when turned into movies. That is not the case with Cujo. It may not be in the league of Misery, The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile or Carrie, but this is a scary little film that relies on very few characters and one hungry dog. The way they made the dog look with the make-up effects was very terrifying to me when I saw this as a kid, and it still is pretty menacing as I watch it now. The story is pretty thin, as was the book, but the suspense and the reality of the situation elevates the material. The events are not supernatural at all. This could really happen.<br /><br />The 25th Anniversary DVD has some great extra features and very nice cover art, especially when compared to that funny one that came out years ago. Worth a cheap buy for your horror collection, or at the very least, a rental.
B00011F5DK|5.0|We've had this game for a few years now.  It's still a family favorite.  If you like Othello or Tetris, you are sure to love this game.  We usually play with three people and take turns on who lays down a tile for the forth color.  It works great and adds to everyone's strategy.  My husband is not a big fan of board games, but enjoys this one.  It doesn't require any reading, so a child who is a pre-reader can join in.  I also like the fact that the rules aren't complicated.  You can learn as you go.
B0017MO10U|3.0|They should change the title to \\"Stargate Reunion\\".  Re-hash of old story lines and return of many SG characters.  It's like compiling several scripts form different episodes.  Dissapointed with the writers and I feel the price I paid is not worth watching.  If you can get it cheaper, buy it, if not rent it.  It's one of theose \\"watch it once\\" movies.
0780628551|3.0|O.K. the movie wasn't that great. It was alright but just average. However, plot aside, I would watch this movie again and again for one thing: the sheer beauty of Charlize Theron. Wow, can she look any better in a film? The phrase \\"doll face\\" was invented for women like Charlize. Just looking at that lovely face \\"made\\" the movie for me, plot be damned. I would and will watch this film again just to see her face. Shallow, maybe but honest and heart felt!
B000002UAU|5.0|Giving away my age here,but I did have the vinyl LP many years ago. I reckon this was the Beatles defining album. This,in my opinion, was their pinnacle and it was all downhill(sadly) from here. Buy it, listen well and enjoy.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|I'm so glad Kenny Wayne put this CD/DVD together. I'm still learning who the true Blues singers/players are. I feel it is excellent he got together with these folks before they passed on. I will always treasure this gift Kenny Wayne has provided for us.  I am truly grateful for the talent that has been shown to me.
B000V86OKG|5.0|Showtime has blown HBO off the map with the these two seasons of Dexter. Now that The Sopranos, Deadwood and Rome no longer around, HBO will need a miracle to compete with the quality of this show.<br /><br />Season two is all about conflict and questions. Lila or Rita? Serial killer or turn himself in? There isn't as much \\"Dexter Morgan justice\\" this time around, but the suspense and top notch acting are here in bucket loads. Just give Michael C. Hall an award already!<br /><br />If you liked the first season (how could you not?) then the second will take you to a different place. They change things up a bit to add freshness, but they never veer too far off course. I think season one was a bit stronger overall, yet I found this one more interesting. I guess it just means that this show is full of surprises.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|This guy is so talented. It is just absolutely amazing the way he can play the guitar. You get to see all three of his musical personalities on this one video. First is his usual acoustic set. Next is his trio set where he just oozes with the influences of SRV and Jimi Hendrix. Lastly, he ends with his pop style. The wonderful thing is he is great at all three. Purchase this and you will not regret it
B001884P5Y|5.0|Gives great insight into the trials of the foundation of this country and the true greatness and humanity of its founders. I thought I was up on history but this series was \\"revelationary\\". I also had no idea how universally George Washington was well thought of by his contemporaries.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I really enjoyed the first DVD, STARGATE - THE ARK OF TRUTH, but felt it was lacking in two areas:  1. no Jack and 2. the \\"movie\\" was no more than a standard two- or three-part episode.  Well, in STARGATE - CONTINUUM, Jack is back, in not one, but TWO roles!  And the story itself is more than satisfying.  It is bigger and better than episode, has all the stops pulled out, and retains all of the great elements we have come to know, expect, and love from Stargate.<br /><br />In STARGATE - CONTINUUM, we find our friends called back from their various exploits around various galaxies to witness the execution of the last of the Ba'al clones, thus the final destruction of the System Lords.  But, as always, Ba'al has a trick up his sleeve, and the twists, turns, and fun begin.  This movie is classic Stargate at its finest, with timelines changed, history rewritten, and our heroes needing to save the day and put everything right.<br /><br />Richard Dean Anderson is perfect in his reprisal of Jack.  I really miss Jack when he isn't there.  Anderson's timing, ingenuousness, and droll repartee are archetypal Jack, and just what we wanted.  Ben Browder, Claudia Black, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, and Christopher Judge are all together again as SG-1.  Cliff Simon out does himself as Ba'al.  There are special appearances by Beau Bridges, the beloved Don S. Davis, William Devane, and pretty much anyone who has played a character over the last 10 years.  It was wonderful to see them all together again, bringing the story full circle and putting a nice, neat, exciting bow on the entire package.<br /><br />STARGATE - CONTINUUM is fast-paced, action-packed and tons of fun.  The special effects are terrific, and definitely a cut above a typical episode (which are pretty good to begin with).  The settings and scenery are beautiful to watch, and are mostly shot on location.  You will find yourself cheering for our heroes, and wondering how they are going to get out of this mess and save the world, as always.  But, as always, they do.  And we wouldn't have it any other way.But, as always, they do.  And we wouldn't have it any other way.
0810994739|5.0|I love this book its as good as the first one! My daughter Ally loved it. She talked about it so much i had to try it. it is great for kids around 8-12. 2 of my daughters read it Ally 11 and Heidi 8
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I have all the seasons bought separately in the plastic cases and most episodes show a lot of film grain on my 50\\" plasma as well as on my 40\\" LCD.  I can minimize it some by TV and DVD player settings, but it can only do so much.  I know film has grain, but there is so much low light shooting in the series, you see a lot of it.  I was just wondered if they did any restoring or remastering on the collector's set.  I'd give anything if they'd release it on Blu-Ray remastered to reduce the grain.  Anyway, let me know if you see a difference between the sets.  Thanks

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|The best collection of Dylan covers I have ever heard. From his most popular songs like \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" by the mega-popular Pearl Jam, to the unreleased and rare \\"I'm not there\\" by the not as popular Sonic Youth (unless you belong to their cult of loyal fans). There are some very cool and different versions of his songs on this CD. Overall, this is a can't miss if you are a Dylan fan. Richie Havens does a terrific job as does the young lad..the 13 year old kid from the movie, sorry...can't remember his name. These songs make you appreciate Dylan in a different way. For me, it made me go back and dust off my Dylan Lps and Cds to listen again to the original versions. Now I hear more nuances in Dylan's songs and am more appreciative of the the meter, the rythm, the math, the lyrics, the structure, the ideas, metaphors, themes, each word, each syllable, how they are pronounced, annunciated, etc. Everything starts to become even more clear and appreciated. It also makes me try to place myself in those times and realize how artists like Dylan and Hendrix for example must have sounded like they came from Mars considering the sounds and music that existed before they came along in the mid-60s. This reminds that the 60s went through a rapid time warp in so many ways not the least of which was the huge evolution of pop art and culture that has not been matched since.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Jonathan Rhys Meyers plays King Henry8 with such passion. He really gets into his charactor. The whole cast is just wonderful. I can't get enough of the show. Sometimes there's alittle too much sex but..Everytime one dvd is done I can't get up fast enough to put the next one in. Then again, I can't shut it off to go to bed for work in the am. I love the time period it take place in, the clothes, castles, etc. It's so nice to have a series out right now that takes place out of history NOT reality TV! If you liked the movie Elizabeth, then you should check this out. This is, of course, her father in his younger yrs when he first came to rule. A must have for any Renaissance lover.
B000VWE5OY|5.0|Absolutely breath taking, keeps you on the edge of your seat all the time. Never a dull moment.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay has been with me through dispair, rebirth, stagnation, and regeneration.  This is, by far, their best album yet.  It encompases all the best parts of Parchutes & Rush of Blood to the Head but expands upon it so far as to move me to tears.  XY could never do that, even though it got me through stagnant times.  When I saw their performance on The Daily Show, I thought 'What was that NPR reviewer thinking?? This is by far the best music they've ever made.\\"  If REM had ever evolved as musicians, what could possibly describe the masterpiece that Coldplay has created?  I am speechless, and driven to tears.
0670020745|3.0|The author really should have used a coauthor.  I'm sure her experience was profound but her book was BORING!  Her narrative/technical document style was not at all engaging and I felt her insights were elementary for anyone having done some spiritual seeking.
1400095204|5.0|In Nigeria, devastated by civil war in the 1960s, we see the birth of the state of Biafra and relearn quite a bit of history.  It is through the eyes of three different characters, whose personal tales intertwine, that history blends with their difficult paths:    Ugwu, a houseboy for eccentric university lecturer Odenigbo.  Olanna, whose parents raise her and twin sister Kainene in the most privileged of backgrounds in Lagos; she leaves everything behind to follow Odenigbo as they are very much in love.  Richard, a timid British national charmed by the Igbo culture and enthralled by Kainene, whose personality is an enigma for everyone.  Obviously many other characters rotate all around and as we become acquainted with each of them, their presence is always pertinent and complementary to the main story.    I would not add anything else as the tale would be spoiled but I cannot refrain from strongly recommending this book as it is informative in many ways, its narrative flows beautifully, heartbreakingly, even comically at times and your heart is captured within the lines.  It does not dwell on the violence of war even though it (the violence) is perceived in subtle but incredibly effective ways.      Read this book, you will not regret it.  Quoting from my review title, simply wonderful, indeed.
B0014XCMVM|3.0|...but whether it will be the last remains to be seen. OK, the disclaimer; I bought it because it was featured at Starbucks, my Starbucks stock is not feeling well.... After the first few cuts, I was ready to toss it...the liberal political bilge of \\"Citizen of the Planet\\", and \\"Underneath\\", the gross vulgarity of \\"Strait Jacket\\"...then she got to the softer numbers, and I was forced to render a grudging respect. [Yes, I've listened to it several times; no one should review after one hearing]......<br /><br />\\"Not As We\\", \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\", and \\"Tapes\\" are wonderful...The title is a line from \\"Moratorium\\", which is a REALLY catchy song........ As I say, this is my first record by Miss Morisette...she really isn't my style...maybe...I sure see where she gets her following.
B00005R23S|5.0|There are probably a dozen reviews here already that are small essays, but the bottom line is that nobody does a concert like Bruce. (And yes, I'm a big U2 fan.) Even if you own every studio album the man did, you need this one. An astonishing performance, and the Boss live is always at his best. I expected something less, because the guy's 50 years old here, but I was wrong wrong wrong.<br /><br />If there is anything to complain about -- and I'm really reaching here -- it might be that a full concert, in sequence, could have fit on two DVDs. The editing here is excellent, but you've got to figure Bruce has some logic behind his set list, and second guessing probably doesn't improve it. Also, I thought a couple of tracks from Disc 2 were hardly the stuff to relegate to the \\"bonus\\" disc.<br /><br />But, mostly I'm just glad we have this document of the greatest rock performer of a generation.
B000N4SHPS|3.0|This movie is about 'heart'; to take it and still fight back.<br />Boxing is a bad metaphor for it as the current legal<br />situation is a financially mediated joke with three recognized champions.<br />Most people have turned to things like kung fu, karate or kick boxing:<br />even women's boxing has more draw than a fixed or fixated heavy weight<br />fight. So why do we still see the hopes of the fighters as<br />something we will watch? Am I spoiling it by saying Rocky loses?<br />But he also delivers his message of heart and courage one more time.<br />I can't give it more than three stars because it<br />is the same old same old...with a new younger woman for love interest.
B001543L92|5.0|This reisues of this past albums of metallica has the best sound!!!!  If you had a great machine , you can hear the diference betwen digital vs analog recordings. This LP has the best sound that I ever heard of this album before.  I Have the CD but this LP kicks the sound of the CD. Since I Heard this record , I Discover that the LP has the best \\"Pure\\" and \\"Unadulterated\\" sound , better that the CDs and the digital files like Mp3. So if you wanna to heard this \\"Pure\\" sound you only need to buy this record!!!!
B00013RC66|4.0|If you are a mystery buff like I am this movie should be added to your collection. The two main actresses are Debera Wingger and Theresa Russell.  They play their parts to the hilt, and the ending has a good twist.

B0018O4YT0|5.0|I was lucky enough to see Dark City during its theatrical run in 1998 and have watched several times over the last ten years. I wouldn't call it one of my favorite films but I definitely think its a classic of its genre and was happy to see that it was not only recieving a new dvd just in time for its ten year anniversary, but more features to replace the old ones which were mostly audio commetaries and two essays from Neil Gaiman and H.G. Wells. So how does the directors cut compare to the original film?  Watching it again for the first time in years there might not be anything noticeable in the changes. This isn't like the Kingdom of Heaven or Blade Runner cuts where whole sequences were taken out of the film creating disharmony in the flow of the story. As far as I could notice most of the cuts to the film were more inserts and extensions than anything else. The narration at the begining of the film is the most famous cut while the only added scene I could tell was showing Murdoch and Bumstead taking Schreber to Shell Beach at the finale. Other scenes included an extensions like a bit of dialogue between the husband and wife who go from middle class to wealthy during the tuning, a scene with Emma finding a little girl in the murdered prostitutes apartment, and a longer ending as Bumstead floats into outer space after discovering the truth about Dark City. I also noticed in some scenes that Trevor Jones score seemed to be dialed down and for the scenes where she sings Jennifer Connely's actual voice is heard. As whole how do all of the cuts add up. I don't think they change my opinion of the film. Its neither better or worse in my opinion. The film is still a good one and thankfully the additions weren't as bad as to hurt the film like Appocalypse Now Redux and its great seeing them reinserted into the film.  So hows the dvd itself.Of course the film itself has recieved a newer transfer that is brighter and more colorful. You never really notice the added scenes like you do on some other films. I never really listen to commentaries but I heard that Roger Ebert recorded a new one for the dvd. I notice that theres three with Ebert and Proyas having their own tracks while Lem Dobbs and David Goyer share a track so for fans I'd assume they're newly recorded. Theres also a spattering of documentaries that taken together roll for over two hours. On the first it has the general making of where filmmakers and actors talk about the film itself. On the second its mainly film professors with Roger Ebert, Lem Dobbs, and Alex Proyas discussing meanings and ideas in the film.  In the end this is a great disc for fans of the film. It might not pick up newer fans but with both cuts collected on the disc as well as the added bonus content I'd definitely recommend this as an easy purchase to those thinking about it.  A little bit more. I recently picked up the Blu-Ray (one of the first movies I buy on DVD becomes one of the first movies I buy on Blu) which has the actual two cuts of the film as well as the other special features. It also has a feature I really liked in the fact track that provides a little window to explain the difference between the theatrical and directors cut as well as background information on inspirations. This was a neat feature especially for this fan of both cuts, and highlights a lot more scenes I missed on my first viewing. As its now 7.99 on Amazon fans of the film or just those who are generally interested have no reason not to pick the disc up.
0307265730|5.0|These stories where beautiful.  Lahiri seemed to push the enveloped a little more with this book, and the result is a beautiful work of prose.  I couldn't put this one down.  It was fantastic.  Again, her stories deal with love, friendship, marriage and tragedy, making her characters real to her readers.      If you read, \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" and liked it, you will love this!
076535618X|4.0|I really enjoyed John Scalzi's first two books in the series, (\\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigades\\") and think that \\"The Last Colony\\" was a worthy third book.<br /><br />This story follows the leads from the the other two books (Jane and John) as they take over the roles as the leaders of an aptly named new colony (no spoilers from me :-) There are plenty of new twists in this story and a lot of loose ends are wrapped up. My only real criticism is that other than the Obin, the aliens are getting very \\"human\\" personalities (I like my aliens...well, alien). Still, this was an enjoyable read and I finished it in one (long) sitting.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you enjoyed \\"Old Man's War\\" and \\"The Ghost Brigade\\".
B000002UAR|5.0|What happens when you get four guys from Liverpool, songs like \\"Taxman\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" and throw in some LSD here and there? You get a rock & roll classic my friend. Revolver was released when rock music was wedged between Folk and Psychedelia, so it should sound way ahead of its time. Does the album stand for the test of time? Read on for my review!    From the opening proto-punk riff of Taxman to the childish nature of Yellow Submarine to the Syd Barret era-Pink Floyd of Tomorrow Never Knows, this album, like I said before, was ahead of its time. Not one song of this album is filler, even Yellow Submarine doesn't get old! George Harrison shines on this album from the bitterness of Taxman to the spiritual Love You To to the difficulty of expressing himself on I Want To Tell You. Paul McCartney also does a superb job with songs like Here There and Everywhere (inspired by \\"God Only Knows\\"), the devil may care attitude of Good Day Sunshine to the bitter For Know One and praising pot, that's right POT on Got To Get You Into My Life. Ringo's voice fits Yellow Submarine perfectly and his drumming is fantastic! He keeps it simple yet does a drum fill nice suitable to the songs he's playing. A very UNDERRATED drummer in rock. And who could forget the man himself... John Lennon. His song writing is without a doubt spectacular! Every song that he wrote here is amazing! Seriously, I'm Only Sleeping, She Said She Said, And Your Bird Can Sing, Doctor Robert, and of course, Tomorrow Never Knows. So what are you waiting for? Got out and buy this rock centerpiece. No classic rock fan should be without this album!    Recomended Tracks: Taxman, I'm Only Sleeping, Love You To, She Said She Said, Tomorrow Never Knows
B0001I562I|4.0|This is one of those 80's movies I saw as a kid and recently decided to buy and watch it again.  While it is defaintely dated, it has a good story, interesting characters and just the right touch of sci-fi.  Acting is only so-so for most of the characters, but its still a pretty good movie and one the whole family can enjoy.
B000059GEH|5.0|These women will go to great lengths to land a rich husband, even if that means selling all they have, living on hot dogs, and going to high society parties to stake out the millionaires. The performances from all three of these actresses are amazing! You can't help but laugh at the silly things they say and do. I am a HUGE Marilyn Monroe fan, and it is one of my favorite movies with her in it, even though I wish she had a slightly bigger part. But hey-it's difficult to see more of her when they have to split the screen time between three. I highly recommend this movie!

B00008GKEG|4.0|Since purchasing this set, I have watched it through twice and some parts three or more times.  It is both entertaining and gives a good overview of Beatles music.  The real strength of this set is the range of music it includes and the very fine video from televised performances, newsconferences, reporting, documentaries, etc.  The film clips are very good.  I also liked the special features extremely well, particularly the feeling of the remaining Beatles (three at that time) about arranging and recording John's \\"Free As A Bird\\" and \\"Real Love\\" tapes.    The film gives only a very general chronology.  It also addresses some controversies in passing, but the main focus is on the music and the sensation that resulted from it as well as recording the individual personalities of The Beatles.  Ringo probably talks more and is more open in the interviews on this series than I have ever seen him.      I found that the series fed my desire to explore specific topics of Beatles history including the Hamburg experience, Stu Sutcliffe, Pete Best, Brian Epstein, George Martin and Goeff Emerick at EMI studios; Cynthia Lennon and Yoko Ono.  So, it's not the whole story, but the central portion of it--the boys themselves and as musicians.  And I take it as a very strong complement to these materials that I was encouraged to look deeper.
B000006NUW|5.0|JULY 2008 REVIEW: I purchased this particular box set a little over a month ago, and I must say: it does NOT disappoint. You really can't complain; although the box set was released several years ago, and therefore the early 1990's CD mastering here isn't necessarily as strong and powerful sounding as a 2008 mastering might be, the tracks presented here are bright and clear. Approximately 100 tracks fill out this 4-CD box set, and most of the songs are winners. And they are presented here in their original mono sound mixes as originally released (an apparent problem for some reviewers here, but I had no issue with it; the songs sound the same as they always have). I was certainly surprised upon listening, track after track, that I was familiar with almost every song on the set. And this many songs for the price!?! Right now, you really can't beat it.   I am very aware of the new MOTOWN box sets chronicling every \\"single\\" released over the years (\\"The Complete Singles Collection-1967\\" for example), but at roughly 100 bucks each, those exhaustive sets are very pricey and really only for hardcore Motown fans (and I for one would love to collect all of those sets one day, but purchasing the entire 1960's collection would run over one thousand dollars!!).  With this box set, of course everything cannot be represented, but a 100+ song collection for (as of now) 35 bucks is a real bargain for a casual fan looking for a basic overall Motown song experience.
0894803123|5.0|I bought this book and fell and love with it the moment I opened it. They give you all the tools for you to think outside the book, with the theory behind how to ice cream and how the ingredents work and the recipes are wonderful, they don't have all the flavors like fish food, or karmal sutra, but they have a lot and like i said they give you the ability to think outside the book and think of stuff on your own.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|The most thrilling, exilarating, touching warm and yet funny operatic presentation of any Operatic score I've ever seen in my Life!!!!!!!!!!!!! A+++++ Villazon is the most lyric spinto Tenor I have ever heard. He is in a cast by himself. Netrebko matches Rolando in every scene and that superb voice WOW A++++++++++++. I've seen the DVD four times already.Recomend anyone to buy and have a ball A++++++++++++
B000MQC9H4|5.0|First of all, I know Cameron Diaz is not the best actress in the world by a long stretch, but the movie is so good in other ways it is still enjoyable. The story line of Iris and the older man (whose name escapes me at the moment) is one of the highlights. Some reviewers said they had a problem with Jack Black being one of the main love interests. For me it wasn't a problem. He was funny, charming and attentive. Why wouldn't Iris fall for him?<br />Jude Law was just delicious, and I loved the surprise story line of his. I've watched this at least 10 times now, and each time get something more out of it. If you watch the commentary, listen to what they say about his hand, playing Iris' theme.<br />One of my all time favorites, and a definite 'comfort' movie!
0141439580|5.0|I have always loved Emma the movie, the one with Gwyneth Paltrow in it. Her Emma is so clueless, so innocent, yet somehow loveable. I finally decided to pick up the classic novel to see if the movie missed anything and to get the full story straight from the author. The book delighted me just as much as the movie did, as I am pleased to say.       Emma Woodhouse is a young, rich woman living with her germaphobe father in the town of Highbury. Bored and eager for some sort of excitement, she decides to matchmake her new friend Harriet Smith with the local vicar Mr.Elton. Emma is convinced that her matchmaking skills are among the best, wrongly taking credit for pairing her governess Miss Taylor with their neighbor Mr.Weston. Many mishaps occur, and many hearts broken and confused, but in the end all is well, with all three of the main couples finding happiness.       It took me a little while to get in the vocabulary of the time, but once I did the book breezed by. Emma is so flawed like all of us; that is why we love her. Just because this book was written almost 200 years ago doesn't make it bad: it makes it better.
B0012E6R3W|2.0|muddy..muddy.. best describes this offering,The rhythm guitars are lost in the drums,All the songs sound the same.Guess what?  I wanna hear  1  the RIFFS,  2  The  lEADS   3 The Bass and the drums   4 I wanna hear the singer but not be overpowered by him. I was not overpowered by the singer  but it did sound a little hollow,,I know,,,I know   its suppose to be heavy  but the only enjoyable part was the musicmanship..Look  folks  this the same mess that was made on the last Exodus album... Andy Sneap's  hearing has FAILED...
B0017MO10U|5.0|This DVD was released on 29 July 2008.  So any reviews you read that are posted before this date are obviously bogus.  However I purchased the DVD myself with American Dollars, Greenbacks, Bucks.  And I thoroughly enjoyed it!  Man, just about everybody returned in this one.  Even that HOT System Lord Nirrti, albeit for a brief moment.  Apophis was there too, but all too briefly for my taste.  Jack O'neill was there also, AND there was talk of cake!  But again, all too briefly for him as well.  However it was a most excellent show and I thoroughly enjoyed it!  We can all thank God for this particular production of Stargate \\"Continuum\\"!  (Spoken while pointing both index fingers toward the heavens!).
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Our entire family loved this one. Even after it was over, we went back to certain parts and watched them over again. I would love to own this and watch it repeatedly. I can't think of a better made series!
B001AD3NIM|4.0|I really haven't had too much exposure to this artist's music, mostly the songs I hear on the radio. I am thinking that this might be the first time I actually purchased a CD of hers. I really like it. I have like other songs she has produced but never felt really driven to buy an entire piece of work by Alanis before. I think this particular CD is musically very rich and fun to listen to more than just a few times. There is a wide swing in the mood of the music and seems to be pretty open in expressing the feeling of the artist. When you can relate to the feelings I think it makes the music more enjoyable.

0143037757|2.0|Somewhat balanced view of Europe from 1945-1979. At times Judt schizophrenically jumps from Europhile to Europhobe. It is good to see someone neither completely sold on nor completely against European integration.<br /><br />Like all \\"history\\" of rather recent times, it is tough to divorce his views from historical analysis. His reasonably objective analysis of Europe falls apart in 1979. He jumps the Left-Right divide into partisan politics. Everything the center-left does in European politics is merely for short-term gain; everything the center-right (and even the Right of Le Pen) does is correct analysis of the situation. He openly states that New Labour's correct policies are only work because of what Thatcher did. Judt has absolutely no love for Mitterrand, who in Judt's view is nothing more than a political opportunist. The footnotes themselves could have been taken from the Michael Moore playbook - not from an historical writing!<br /><br />His epilogue is some spot on analysis. He rejects the inevitability of a \\"wider, deeper union\\" based on the fact that cultural differences exist and that the EU will have to continue to work at as opposed to just letting it take its course. Yet, the founder of the inevitability doctrine (\\"neofunctionalism\\") - Ernst B. Haas - determined that 40 years ago; maybe it's good to be reminded that political integration takes work.<br /><br />I would not say this is a must read for anybody and the footnotes with pot shots at Blair, Mitterrand and others from the center-left detract from the objectivity of the work.
0670020745|3.0|This book was very interesting reading. Gives an excellent view of a stroke from a professional's inside view.
B000000HU0|3.0|3 1/2    Consistent, if slightly under-performed album still makes the grade for six strong tracks of eclectic, progressive instrumentation jamming, minus some of the detracting humor which sometimes infests Gong albums.
0307388840|4.0|A wonderful read (well... a wonderful listen... I got the audiobook).  Jill Tanner's reading was gorgeous... GORGEOUS.  McEwan should buy her a hot meal.  She really brought his words to life.  I enjoyed this book immensely.  The unveiling at the end... twisting back in your mind.  Lovely read.  Worth the purchase.
B000A2IPP0|4.0|I am pleased with the product, but I do prefer ET in it's original version.    This movie is the remake with some extra scenes which I think take away from the original film.  They should have left it as it originally was: a masterpiece!
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Has it really been ten years since writer/director Alex Proyas (The Crow, I Robot) first unleashed the highly influential, groundbreaking, and underrated Dark City?  Yes it has, and to celebrate being a decade old, Dark City has finally been re-released as a Director's Cut that preserves Proyas' original vision.  Upon first viewing this director's cut of Dark City, you will notice some subtle differences, all of which help make Dark City even better than it was before.  Gone is Kiefer Sutherland's opening narration, leaving the viewer to attempt to figure things out for themselves before the plot exposes itself.  The special features carry over the commentaries from the previous release (including the one with film critic Roger Ebert, who called Dark City the best film of 1998), as well as some new featurettes that find Proyas and co. retrospecting about making the film.  As for the film itself, I won't go into story details since you can find them on this page, but let it be said that Dark City is a film you will not forget.  Innvoative for it's time and pre-dating anything The Matrix would do by a year plus, Dark City is a spectacular science fiction feast for the senses.  If you've never seen the film, you are indeed doing yourself a disservice.
B001BMKOZW|1.0|Daron used to be my favorite guitarist and SOAD was my band, but now that he actually is out on his own, Whats the difference this stuff is terrible, I cant tell any song apart. This is his excuse to write worthless tiresome lyrics apart his personal life, \\"Do drugs\\" \\"Do prostitutes\\" \\"Drive up and Down Santa Monica Blvd\\" \\"Hate on Jesus and the US\\". I mean come on inspire us to do something positive, not just hate on everything nowadays. I mean should we follow and listen to a drug head with a guitar.  Why not find the neighborhood coke fiend or hippy and follow his views no less. And the musical is recycled SOAD riffs with some more power chords , it all sounds the same man.  And so does Serj, he sucks even worse, if they dont like America so much they can just get outttt! They dont do us any better, Jesus was at least the one person who provoked positive thinking and loving one another, hate just breeds violence and their is no such thing as positive anger it all leads down the same road.
B000007MVU|4.0|Nice easy listening of old classics.  Great for babyboomers who would like to hear songs their parents probably sang along to.  I know mine did.  Good job, Ringo!
B00063EMJ6|4.0|What's up with fans crying \\"sellout\\" over this album? If you're a longtime fan and have all these songs already relax - this disc wasn't meant for you. As if you don't have any 'best ofs' of other artists in your collection. Any artist with a catalog as extensive as Neil's should have a few compilations for newbies and casual listeners. At least there isn't a new track on this disc that isn't available elsewhere. Now THAT'S a cheap sellout gimmick.    That said, this compilation could have picked up where \\"Decade\\" left off.
0446402389|1.0|The book is a great read until the final few chapters.  The solution to the mystery is horrible....god awful...and makes the whole book collapse in on itself.  Why his editor did not stop him from publishing that ending, is a question that I would love to have an answer for.
0385333846|5.0|I don't care who you are, you absolutely need to read this book. It's justly considered a classic. The thing about it is that it isn't really a \\"humor book\\" like some of Vonnegut's other, justly famous works (Cat's Cradle, Breakfast of Champions, God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater). Parts of it are funny - I especially like the segments with the bitter Kilgore Trout, a sci-fi author reputed to be one of the worst ever - but humor isn't the focus of this book. Rather, it focuses on creativity and a solid message. Most if not all of Kurt's work is topical to some extent, but here his message comes to the fore.<br />Vonnegut's view of time here is fascinating. Rather than present it as a straight line, as most other authors do, he explores its more abstract natures. To him, time is not a line, but a complex network of points that anybody at any time can travel arbitrarily amongst. This is prime creativity. Some of the most memorable segments of the book involve hapless hero Billy Pilgrim becoming \\"unstuck in time.\\" The first time he describes it, he takes a beautiful, \\"poetic-prose\\" approach. He floats freely through ideas, ideas that intentionally don't connect but are still beautifully written. Billy actually experiences both his birth and his death over the course of the book.<br />But here is the REAL reason why you need to read Slaughterhouse-Five. It's very much an anti-war book, and the central message it communicates is that there are no heroes in war. The war Vonnegut focuses on is World War II, specifically the Allies' firebombing of Dredsen, Germany, an event that killed more people than Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It's clear that Vonnegut holds Nazi Germany in the utmost of contempt. But he also makes the claim that the Allies were not flawless, wonderful supermen. It's obvious that he believes in their ideals, but he also argues that they could be just as bad as their enemies. After all, countless German civilians were killed during the Dredsen firebomings, and I'm going to guess most of them had nothing to do with the Axis powers. In today's world, in today's wars, things aren't so black-and-white, and I think our President desperately needs a reminder of that. This conviction of his that America is the heroic cowboy, shooting down them no-good varmints with a gun in every holster, then mounting his horse and riding off into the sunset, is simply delusional. Don't get me wrong, I have as much if not more hatred for the terrorists our soon-to-be-ex-President (hopefully to be replaced by Barack Obama, but that's irrelevant) is so staunchly opposed to. They certainly are psychopaths, and the world would be a better place without them. But I can at least see where they're coming from. After all, hasn't America stolen their culture with its obsession with a globalist economy? There are no clear-cut heroes or villains in this war. Both sides have understandable motives, and while I admittedly side with the U.S. on this matter (though the Iraq War is at least as unnecessary as the Vietnam War, and has arguably done more damage to our country's reputation), the terrorists do have a point, I suppose. And that's why you need to read this book. Because war isn't as simple and clear-cut as certain presidents would like to believe it is. This is a fine example of preaching to the choir, since I'm a pacifist (except in extreme cases, like World War II), but I simply love this book on many, many levels. Vonnegut's masterpiece. If you wanted proof that he was an author of real literary merit and not just some weirdo - though if that's the case, you can't be my friend - this is a sure bet.guess most of them had nothing to do with the Axis powers.

B00005JN8Z|5.0|Why do so many of the reviews I read here,   write of this movie as if it were a church sermon? What is this extraordinary concentration on religion in so many areas. I feel these people would find a sermon in a shopping list!  It's a MOVIE for God's sake [sorry about that], and as a movie I have always had a fondness for it. Silly though it may be, it's a lot of entertaining fun. I can't wait for the release.. I've been waiting for it for years. I remember sneaking along to see it in short pants, somehow I got in, even though I was far to young to do so.At the time I think I was thrilled with epic movies. The scale of this one is huge, they didn't need digital effects to get their ideas on screen, just imagination.The cast is splendid, Ustinov totally over the top, childish yes, but convincingly vicious, Robert Taylor, as wooden as ever, seems to work in the style context of the movie. Leo Genn,always underestimated,  is as ellegant as he should be. And Debbie Kerr is all class.  Get a copy of this, and indulge yourself in a truly wonderful example of what Hollywood could do best at this time. I for one can't wait.    John Corcoran.  Scarborough,NSW.  Australia.

B000PXVXVW|3.0|the watch itself is fine so far, I have owned it for only a month or two. The bad thing is that the band falls apart so easily, that it is a real hassle. I have had to throw the band away and use a ribbon as the band and that is much better. So be warned.  Unfortunately after a month it stopped working. I would now give it one star but I don't seem to be able to change that.
B000NW6OY6|5.0|I purchased a copy of Watership Down at a used book store. This was a copy without a doubt older than me. I was intrigued by it only because I had heard it labeled a literary classic. If it hadn't been for that I likely would've passed on the story about \\"talking rabbits\\".    I think the most amazing part about this book, and also one of the things that made it so enjoyable, was that it transcends what you would expect a book with this plot line to be about. Seemingly without much trouble, author makes you care deeply for the wide array of characters in this book.    My advice is to read no further reviews or descriptions about this book. Simply pick it up and see for yourself. Start from scratch with this wonderful story and you'll enjoy it that much more. The names take a little getting used to, but you'll know them by heart in no time.    You will never look at a rabbit the same way again.
0312360266|3.0|Okay, I'll admit it.  I've got a bit of the YA vampire bug.  I picked this up on a splurge, primarily because I was interested in the idea of a mother and her young daughter writing a book together.    And that union did add a lot of flavor.  I get the feeling that the main character Zoey is a more realistic teenager than many of the other YA books currently out there.    Essentially, Zoey is a dead normal girl until she gets chosen to become a vampire (dead normal - ha!).  She's whisked away from her ordinary life to The House of Night - vampire boarding school.  Her adventures continue as she becomes the chosen of a vampire goddess, clashes with the school 'in' crowd, and meets a really good looking boy.  It's a fun story and for the most part, I enjoyed it.    There are two things that bother me about this book though and keep me from giving it a better rating.    First...  Seeing as Zoey is sixteen, I'm assuming that the target age for the book is 13-14. (that is how editors determine YA marketing.  Teens read books about kids a couple of years older than themselves, for the most part.) There is just too much sexual content for that age group.  Add to that underage drinking.  Yes, both occur in real life, but it feels gratuitous, and the book could have been just fine without it.    Second...  The big bad guy is an organized religion that seems to me to be a replication of Evangelical Christianity.  I've seen this done before (Good guys = vampires.  Bad guys = churches) and handled in such a way that it melded with the story and worked without a problem.    In Marked, it seemed heavy handed and more like a message from the authors' on how they feel about organized religion rather than a true plot point.

B0017R5UAA|5.0|I think Fleet Foxes have been around for a while, but they were new to me. I read a review of their CD in a magazine, comparing their sound to Crosby, Stills, & Nash of the 60's & 70's.  This is a very fair comparison, as Fleet Foxes have beautiful harmonies.  Something about the music feels very airy and woodsy, which is very hard to explain.  The songs make me feel like I am in a medieval castle or forest.  \\"Your Protector\\" is probably my favorite.  Your 17 year old son may not be wild about this (mine is not) but it has a definite siren's call effect for aging or wanna-be hippies who missed their calling.  Beautiful!
B0017MO10U|3.0|Spoiler Free Review    The Good:  This movie is much better than The Ark of Truth. The special effects are first rate. It was nice to see the old characters. You see a little more grit ie. blood and bad language. Overall it was enough to get my \\"Stargate Fix\\".  But not enough to recommend a buy. Buy if you want to complete your Stargate dvd collection. Otherwise, rent it.     Ben Browder is finally hitting his stride. His performance was much better in this movie. I stopped thinking of him as John Crichton and thought of him as Cam Mitchell. Claudia Black and Beau Bridges were outstanding.     The Bad:  The story felt very rushed and like a long tv episode.  There could easily have been a Continuum 1 and 2 if the writers would stop and develop the characters a bit more.  I think most fans prefer quality over quantity.    As much as love Richard Dean Anderson, his performance wasn't that great.  He is self aware on camera and his timing is slightly off. You could tell he's simply out of practice. I wonder if they were just too afraid to tell him.      The Ugly:  The amount of Botox used was incredible! RDA and AT have the same flat faced mask look thru most of the show. The result is that RDA seems sad and AT seems bored. We all know the whole cast is older. Stargate has been on what 13-14 years?  Why do they have to stay young?

B000005HFH|5.0|Now, admittedly I'm not a fan of too much jazz music, but that's mainly because I can't handle the self-indulgence of long solos or the arrogance of many jazz musicians.  In fact, if you look back on Chet's career, releasing this album killed his credibility in the jazz scene.  He went from being a hip trumpet player to being a pop singer, basically.  Personally, I think its the smartest move he's ever made.<br /><br />This album is amazing.  I like it more than any other jazz album I've ever heard, and despite what I said earlier, I do listen to quite a bit of jazz (how can you hate an entire style?).  So that being said, why do I like this album?  Because Chet has an incredibly seductive, relaxing voice.  These songs are beautiful and he sings them with a croon that rivals Sinatra for originality and beauty.  He was a serious heroin addict and at one time was followed around by all of the newspapers like some celebrities are today.  However, he got too far into it and eventually ended up committing suicide by jumping out of a hotel room window (though its disputed that he might have fallen while under the influence of heroin).<br /><br />Like many other of my favorite singer/songwriters (Elliott Smith, Kurt Cobain, John Lennon, Brad Nowell) Chet had a lot of pain in his life when he wrote his songs.  For whatever reason, this tends to lead musicians to sound more emotionally authentic in their music.  Chet's music has relaxed me and brought me near tears before by virtue of its being so emotionally honest and raw.  It helps that the songs are great already and Chet sings them like they're his.  This is the best relaxation cd out there, period, and Chet is one of the best vocalists, jazz or otherwise, that I've ever had the pleasure to be exposed to.  Go on, listen for yourself.
B00005JNJV|4.0|I purchased this movie a few weeks before the Dark Knight debuted in theaters.  I give it a 4/5 star only because there are almost no bonus features whatsoever on this disc.  It is the movie only.  Otherwise this is an excellent film for any comic book or batman fan.
0807126063|5.0|Most folks it seems abhor reading with a near violent, reflexive revulsion. Almost as if the mere suggestion would cause a spontaneous eruption of projectile vomiting directed forthwith at the unfortunate proposer. People just hate to read. But this is a book that could inspire a change of heart in even the most hard-core anti-literate. It's a clich&eacute; you've heard a million times before (with a strong contempt for empty superlatives it's not something very likely to arise from this source again), but Confederacy of Dunces was a genuine pleasure to read.<br /><br />Anybody who can't understand why this book has such a strong and enduring popularity probably didn't like the Seinfeld show. Two guys created Seinfeld, Jerry and Larry David, the latter arguably providing the majority creative input. This book has a tremendous deal in common with both Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm, so much so it's safe to call it a dirty precursor to both. The absurdist humor derived from the ridiculousness so commonplace in the mundane every-day takes a very particular perspective to appreciate, and reframe in a comedic fashion. As testament to the success of both this book, and those shows witness the massive commercial and critical success of both. If you happen to find yourself in the small minority who doesn't appreciate this type of humor, then you won't enjoy this book.<br /><br />The understated subtlety of this work belies a masterfully sophisticated writing style and truly original story. In addition to being hilarious, this book is a celebration of a powerfully individualistic personality (and of individualism itself), and though they are rebuffed as deviants by the collective, it's a reminder of how important authentic iconoclasts are in our increasingly conformist society.
B00005JCAA|4.0|This is a film that is driven by dialogue and suspense.  If you watch it you will be moved and fascinated by the idea of death.  By the film's end there is without a doubt a connection between WIll Parrish that will leave the audience wanting Will to live.  A truly sad and beautiful movie.
B000IMUYJM|3.0|...in a theater and it scarred me tremendously. As an adult, nothing special. Some good creepy moments, but over all very typical 70's horror movie. There is noticable camera work (subjective angle shots by the psycho killer) that was adopted by John Carpenter four years later in Halloween. Halloween is two stars superior to this movie. Can I recommend it? Only if you are a huge fan of horror from all time periods and do not expect too much from this film. Don't get me wrong. Its not a bad movie, just not as great as many of the reviews I see glorifying it. You will have to decide on your own about whether its worth a purchase or not. It does not have the re-watchability factor like Halloween does. Its not the ending on either film, but the journey along the way that brings you back again and again or not. I just didn't think this journey was worth much of a second time around.
B000002KE2|5.0|This album kicks. A masterpiece of metal. An awesomeness I can't seem to justify in words except to say, check it out and see for yourself.
B00009ATIX|2.0|I couldn't get through this. It's an interesting sci-fi concept movie, but the tale is just not told fast enough, I guess. I got sick of flashbacks to George Clooney's idyllic married life with the clone who haunts him on a spaceship off the planet Solaris. The soundtrack is nicely atmospheric and the photography is great. Just doesn't cut it as a night's viewing pleasure.
B0013HE4HE|5.0|There are simply not enough words in the English language to describe how good this album is.     I had been thinking about buying a Goldfrapp album for years, but never took the leap. I came to them by way of Thievery Corp, Massive Attack, Potishead and Morcheeba, to name a few, but the heavy electronic sounds of albums 2 and 3 made me hesitate. I received notification about their Radio City show and decided to check their website out and was mesmerized by the loop that plays on the site. Clicked over to amazon and immediately downloaded this album. It has not stopped playing since! My classic rock husband is even a fan now.     You should not die without hearing this. It's summery and ethereal and just Happy! Each song is a work of art and I don't think there is a dud on it. Do yourself a favor and experience this album. Alison has a lovely voice.    Rather than Thievery et al, I would relate this album more towards a delightful mix of Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Pink Floyd and the Beatles with a tiny touch of the good aspects of Enya mixed in and the crescendo 'pop' song writing of Stretch Princess, although I would say it really is it's own thing and no copy of anyone else. I really find the songs emotional, lush and delightful.    I'm sorry that some people were disappointed with the album because of expectations of more dance music, but that is no reason to dislike this album for it's own strengths. Besides, they are kind enough to give us remixes of the songs to dance to.

The one thing for certain is that Factotum is a not-so-guilty pleasure. For L7 square types like me, it's fun to careen through Bohemia atop the words of Bukowski. He may not be the world's greatest writer, but his works are consistently a good time and incredibly engaging. These joyous and tragic remembrances of his time coming up are a wonderful diversion from daily life--especially for those of us too cowardly to live in harmony with our convictions. Concerning the film adaptation, which included scenes from three short stories as well, I think Matt Dillon did an excellent job. I realize some folks didn't like him as Buk but I thought he pulled off the role exquisitely. In my view, a great book and a ton of fun.

B00177Y9ZC|2.0|In 1992, Steven Gould published his first novel, called _Jumper_, which was an immediate success and has remained popular since. In 2004, he published a sequel, _Reflex_, which, like many sequels, wasn't nearly as good -- though it wasn't really bad. Then, in 2007, as the long-awaited film version was underway, Gould rewrote the story more cinematically and published it as _Jumper: Griffin's Story_. You would think at least one of those would be the basis for the movie, right? Nope. Only a few points are carried over from the page to the screen: from the first book, the character's name and the fact that he robs a bank. (In the book, it was done in desperation because he was too young to get a job in the big city; in the film, he does it almost as a lark, just because he can.) From the sequel comes the notion that there exists a secret society of teleport-hunters who will stop at nothing to exterminate them. (In the book, no real reason is given for their murderous crusade; in the film, it's merely attributed to \\"religious fanaticism,\\" with no explanation of what's \\"religious\\" about it.) The plot, you should excuse the expression, jumps all over the place, painting David Rice as a not very sympathetic slacker with too much money. Hayden Christensen isn't very believable, being much too old for the role, and Samuel L. Jackson as the Bad Guy is painful to watch. Jamie Bell is somewhat better as the rather nihilistic Brit, Griffin, taken (sort of) from the third novel. And the character of David's mother, played by Diane Lane, makes no sense at all: She's a committed teleport-killer, but she's protecting her teleport son? But she still hasn't changed her mind about the necessity of wiping them out -- so she just wishes him luck? Gimme a break. This could have been a really good film, and it apparently took three screenwriters to ruin it.

1594481784|4.0|Nick Hornby writes a winning novel about three young slackers.  He pokes gentle fun at them as they navigate  the bewildering puzzles of romance and life. This is one of Hornby's earlier books, and his tone is not as polished as it will become. Still, he offers up his hilarious take on male-female relationships, and the vicissitudes of a young man's heart. This may not be Hornby at his best, but it is still very enjoyable.<br /><br />The three record store guys are forever making lists of their top songs, I succumbed to the temptation, and eventually made a list of the songs mentioned in the book that the characters love or despise. You can find most of them on youtube in the form of videos. I mostly agreed with their tastes. It was a lot of fun to indulge in this walk down memory lane. It was also sobering to see how old these songs really were.<br /><br />This may be a unique instance where I liked the movie more than the book. Of course, I saw the movie years ago, when I was closer in age to the characters.  It may not live up to my memories if I view it now. Nevertheless, it is a book I can recommend to those of a certain age, who remember their local record store with fondness.

0743454537|5.0|How far do you go to save the life of your dying child? And is it possible for a parent distinquish between the love they feel for their children?  I put the premise of this book to my mother, and she had no answers for me. As a mother of two, all she said was, \\"send me the book, then I'll tell you.\\"  But I don't think she'll have an answer either.  I can imagine that a book club could hold some GREAT discussions about the plot of this book, and the ethics of giving birth to one child for the specific purpose of saving another.     On one hand, I have never read anything by Jodi Picoult, so I was very pleased to \\"discover\\" someone new.  But I will admit that can't say that the voice of this novel is very different or any fresher than her other novels, and clearly she is very prolific.     But this was clear -- this is a great, compelling tale.  I am recommending it to all my sister-friends.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|I really enjoyed this fun little movie.  Much has been made of the dizzying effects of the \\"hand held camera\\" style of filming.  This complaint is a non issue.  If you want dizzy, watch blair witch.  This movie holds your attention with its realistic portrayal of New York yuppies being terrorized by the giant creature known as \\"Cloverfield\\".  The characters are almost incidental, the real excitement is the game of hide and seek that the filmakers play with the audience concerning the monster.  The big reveal is worth the price of the movie.  The creature is genuinly original and even kind of scary in its abstract sort of way.  The cast of talented but relative unknowns keeps the viewer focused on the story and on the edge of their seat waiting for just one more glimpse of the creature.  There are not a lot of special features.  A interesting \\"making of\\" documentary and some \\"deleted scenes\\" that neither add nor subtract from the movie in any way and a pretty decent commentary.  A fun ride with few slow moments, a bit of wit and clever effects. I definately recommend it.
0140306013|4.0|Story wise this book deserves five stars but overall I gave it four because the author is not very good at explaining things. Over and over again I was lost when he was describing landscapes and the fauna found in them. Perhaps people native to his country (England) would understand what he was talking about in a heartbeat but I'm American and so many of the things he talked about (downs, hedgerows, cattle wades, etc.) I've never even heard of before. At times, I had to look up dozens of things on Google (and sometimes, even then, I was lost). I think he should have used less terminology and just explained things in general terms everybody knows.    It helped me when reading this book to just kind of disregard anything I couldn't figure out, make up my own scene in my head, and go on.    The landscape descriptions are the only hard thing to understand. Everything else is crystal clear. So by doing this I stopped myself from getting frustrated and was able to enjoy the good story.
B0012QCZ54|3.0|Okay.  I am one of those people that when you say a movie part 2, I can only say, seriously?  Now granted Step Up was an average movie. Did not get blockbuster ratings or hit the box office hard.  I liked it though.  Channing, stud muffin.  Jenna, amazing.  Together made an average movie, with sterotypical dancing.  Step Up 2 is a less than average movie with crazy dancing.  The dancing, along with the music in this movie is nuts.  Rob whatever his name, is just rippin it in this movie.  The female lead however I wish we could see more of whatever type of dancing she does.  To me it was a showcase of the stud muffin Rob as opposed to the apparent life trials of Briana.  Then you get the person who they want to play the nerd sidekick.  Except they forgot that Adam is sicker then the chick he plays opposite of.  I really don't know how the chick dances, but in the movie everyone out shines her.  That Adam kid is crazy good.  He plays Moose, and it threw me way off when he started rippen it.  However, the dances are freakin done.  They are sooo crazy.  Granted they have their continuity errors, but still, everyone is crazy in it.  Check out the Jabowakeeze and then Rainen from them in the 410, What. When the dudes are up in the scene, they are KILLIN it!!! It is the best s!@# ever.  So whould I say watch it?  Sure.  But, I would say watch only the dance sequences.  I can promise you the music and the dances are crazy.  I would only watch the movie for the dancing.  Acting, not so good.  Dancing, worth it.

No strings attached.<br /><br />After a few more times of listening and deep-diving it, I suddenly found myself hooked to the loops and beats of what could be considered the best Daft Punk album ever. A risky project which turned into quite a good electronic/house classic, as good for workout as it is for partying.<br /><br />Weird samples, extreme loops, mad beats and several other bizarre sounds made this album an essential if you're in it for electronic.<br /><br />\\"Around the World\\" is a true all-time gem, for sure.<br /><br />Strongly not recommended for \\"Easy Listening\\" or \\"Adult Contemporary\\" fans.

B001ACY8D2|5.0|Sigur Ros wrote another masterpiece, it's as simple as that. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge Sigur Ros fan and indeed have a biased opinion, but hey, I'm a huge Coldplay fan as well and think that their last album (viva la vida, received it the same day as Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust) is simply and sadly utterly B-A-D, so trust me when I tell you that this new material from \\"the boys from Iceland\\" is simply amazing. Following the track laid out by their previous album \\"Takk\\", with more upbeat songs (note that \\"upbeat\\" is not exactly Sigur Ros's forte, so take that with a grain of salt), it again shows Sigur Ros's incredible skills at mixing \\"regular\\" instruments such as guitar (even though they usually love to play it with violin/cello bows, since day 1 with albums like \\"Von\\" or \\"Ágætis Byrjun\\", go see them live and you'll understand), with amazing strings/orchestras pieces mixed to it, adding amazing hopelandic lyrics/chants/choirs to the mix. Amazingly, I would say that this album is one of the most accessible piece they ever wrote (vs other albums like \\"()\\" that could be somewhat challenging to the \\"Sigur Ros newbie\\"), and yet, the orchestrations are so amazing that this is simply the best album I've heard this year (for 2008, the best album of 2007 was IMHO \\"In Rainbows\\" by Radiohead). Simply buy it, you won't regret it.
B00005JPNZ|1.0|Refreshing as it is to see history's greatest villains, the Communist Soviets, portrayed as the bad guys (including a big goon who looks very much like Vladimir Putin), this movie can only be enjoyed if you leave your brain at home, or if you don't have one to start with. It had me hooked during the opening sequences, up until (SPOILERS) the ridiculous warehouse standoff, in which a room full of armed men hesitate to shoot two men with pistols. Then the chase sequences and such began, pretty dull and unrealistic, but nothing compared to Indiana surviving a nuclear blast by hiding in a refrigerator (for that matter why did the army leave televisions running on the test site?) So yes, he survives the nuclear explosion, the \\"lead-lined\\" fridge (conveniently labelled as such for our benefit) doesn't cook him to a crisp in the heat, nor does the immense radiation poison him (they do give the character a shower, after all. Maybe they should have tried lawn sprinklers at Chernobyl?)    In a grapple to the death with Cate Blanchette's character, Indy's son politely doesn't hit her, despite her kicking the crap out of him. What a steaming load. Anyway it continues in this vein for the full braindead 2 hours. The script is banal and illogical, dialogue atrocious, plot - such as it exists - contrived, and it's really hard to imagine Spielberg actually involved in this thing.
0312427999|4.0|This book explains the economic disasters of the last few decades.  It connects the dots.  I finally understand why international organizations such as the World Bank insist on destroying the economy of every country which encounters a financial glitch, all under the guise of providing help.   It explains why the glitches.    I wish that, in all the cases surveyed, it covered the role of churches and other institutions which claim to be on the side of poor people (and usually are not).
1400063515|5.0|In 1997 my cousin worked on Wall Street and suggested to her colleagues that the office keep a rubber raft in the storage room in case the World Trade Center gets attacked again. She had to leave soon after that partly because her colleagues thought she was crazy. In fact, she was dead right. She had predicted what this book calls a \\"Black Swan\\"...something so \\"far-fetched\\" that most people cannot or will not predict it.    One reason why I never bought real estate in an urban area is because we humans can all be evacuated before a nuclear incident but the real estate will get contaminated - people who don't understand the concept of the \\"Black Swan\\" would laugh at this consideration.    This is one of the best books you can read that describes how knowing what you don't know is more important than knowing what you know. Anything can happen and it won't *not* happen just because it never happened before or is \\"far-fetched\\". Terrorists flying 4 passenger planes into buildings (or the ground) was a \\"far-fetched\\" idea. It is interesting to know that the US Military takes this book and this author very seriously.
0307387178|5.0|This book was a great journey through nature, society, and the inner being. The movie and book have both had a lot of controversy surrounding them. With many people calling Chris a fool and the book glorifying his mistakes, and others idolizing Chris and wishing they could go on their own journey. And while i can see how people would get both of these views i don't think the book is either.<br /><br />I think the author did an excellent job at telling the story of Chris. You feel like your going down the river, working in the cornfields, and enjoying Alaska's wilderness. Mixed in with Chris's story are some of the authors own and other peoples similar journey's. I think these add to the book a lot. They help you see a little more into the type of person Chris was.<br /><br />If you approach this book with a level head and open mind you will enjoy it. Read it an think about who Chris was, why he went on this journey, and what did he do wrong. Don't idolize him for what he did. Don't criticize him for who he was. Accept the fact that he was and that he experienced things in life most never will. Enjoy walking into the wild.
1591841666|4.0|I originally gave this book a lousy review. (I bought the CD). But after thinking about it for a while, I changed my mind. It does not cover every possible angle of the \\"dip\\" concept and all of its ramifications.  However, the basic argument of the book is sound. The lesson of the book is simple.  If you are going after a worthy goal, make sure that you give it your best. If you get hung up (the dip), keep pushing. You will get results beyond typical. If you are not going after a worthy goal, drop it and move on. Simple but great advice.  I originally got hung up on all of the \\"what ifs\\" resulting from this concept. Don't overthink this book! Take it for what it is - a very simple set of rules for basic decision making.

0792843584|2.0|\\"Heaven's Gate\\" is remembered today as \\"the film that sank United Artists\\" and one of Hollywood's all-time biggest box office disasters. Written and directed by Michael Cimino shortly after his success with \\"The Deer Hunter\\", its budget escalated from $7.8 million to over $40 million when UA, in a shockingly shortsighted contract, allowed Cimino unlimited cost overruns. Cimino shot an outrageous 1.3 million feet of film and edited the film to 5 hours and 25 minutes, then to the 3 hour 39 minute version on this DVD for the premiere in November 1980. It was almost universally panned by critics. A 2 1/2 hour cut was widely released to theaters and all but ignored by filmgoers. Michael Cimino's career was essentially over, as was United Artists shortly thereafter.<br /><br />I was prepared to like this film. American critics in 1980 thought that it had no redeeming value. French critics years later praised it to the heavens. I thought the truth might be somewhere in between: a mediocre film that suffers from excessive length. The Americans may have punished the film for Cimino's behavior. The French make a point of loving everything Americans hate. Perhaps the shorter cut that flopped at the box office was too short for the style in which it was filmed. No such luck. When I finally saw \\"Heaven's Gate\\", it was worse than I expected. In addition to the litany of problems with the film itself, this is a terrible script. If it had not undone United Artists and served as a symbol of artistic self-indulgence, \\"Heaven's Gate\\" would not be remembered at all.<br /><br />In Johnson County, Wyoming 1892, an organization of wealthy ranchers, the Stock Growers Association, is frustrated with the tide of homesteading immigrants who are poaching their cattle. Under the leadership of the well-connected Frank Canton (Sam Waterson), the Association draws up a death list of 125 homesteaders and hires 50 mercenaries to execute them. Sheriff Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is sympathetic to the plight of the immigrants and tries to ensure the legality of the Association's actions. The Association's foreman Nate Champion (Christopher Walken), a rival of Averill's for the affections of one Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert), is becoming wary of his employer's violent means. Angry ranchers, desperate immigrants, and all hell is going to break loose.<br /><br />As to the veracity of the events depicted in \\"Heaven's Gate\\", the Johnson County War really did happen, sort of. The battle between immigrants and mercenaries employed by the Stock Growers Association was averted before it could take place. Many of the characters in the film take their names from real people: Ella Watson, Jim Averill, Frank Canton, Nate Champion, W.C. Irvine. But the roles they play in the film are entirely different from those in reality. Watson and Averill were dead by 1892. So the film is fictional except for the general circumstances of the conflict in Johnson County.<br /><br />\\"Heaven's Gate\\" consists of scenes that run too long and scenes whose purpose is mysterious. There is just a lot of footage that doesn't accomplish much. The dialogue is corny and cliched. One major fault is that the film fails to make the immigrants sympathetic. They are an unruly cabal of hot-headed peasants whom we never know and certainly never like. Another failure is that Jim Averill is entirely opaque. We don't have any idea why he is in Wyoming or why he does anything. I can't imagine why Canton is hauling Billy Irvine, a drunken thorn in his side, around with him either. Actually, I don't know why Irvine is in the movie. This film is just like that. It doesn't make sense.<br /><br />When people can't find anything else good to say about \\"Heaven's Gate\\", they praise Zigmos Dsigmond's cinematography. He is one of the great talents of his era. This film is in color but almost sepia-toned, so brown is the predominant color. In the print that I saw, the brown had an unwelcome pink undertone. I don't know if it's a problem with the transfer or if the film really looked like that. There is much artistic rendering of dust or, less commonly, smoke. For 3 hours, I wondered how Zigmos Dsigmond kept the dust out of his camera. There is no denying that Dsigmond's photography looks good if I ignore the pink. (The pink was bad judgment if it was intentional.) But this isn't his best work, and it is very self-conscious at times.<br /><br />Whatever its faults -and they are many- \\"Heaven's Gate\\" ultimately fails because no one or thing in the film is compelling. It has compelling moments, but they are fleeting. Each time I saw one, I hoped the film would take off from there. It never happened. This is basically 3 3/4 hours of texture. A script with bad dialogue, nebulous characters, and actions without motivation should never have been green-lighted. In his book \\"Final Cut\\", Stephen Bach, who was one of UA's heads of production, places blame for the film mostly on Michael Cimino. I don't dispute that, but Cimino wouldn't have had the opportunity to run amok if Bach had not liked this lousy script. The only bonus feature on the MGM 2000 DVD is a theatrical trailer (1 min).

B0011KQSZ4|4.0|When the father of a completely dysfunctional family dies, members of his extended family arrive to give him a dignified send off, but, with such a family, it turns into an English Drawing room farce. The oldest son,Daniel and his wife, live with the deceased and his wife and from the start, things go awry. The wrong body is in the coffin and sets the scene for all the other scenes. One of the younger family members is manufacturing and selling halucinogenic pills and unwittingly allows them to be mistaken for Valium with the expected results and one of the eldest members of the family is a cranky, bad tempered old devil who has an unfortunate episode of loss of bowel control which really made me heave! I didn't enjoy this movie as much as 4 weddings and a funeral, but the writing was excellent and the cast were first rate.
074356619X|5.0|I have read the book and then listened to the 4-CD set. We share the CD among my friends- I never get tired of listening to it as I drive back and forth to work.

1401302378|5.0|Anderson's TV appearance on Charlie Rose induced me to read his Wired column which interested me in his book; all part of the long tail of information and connectivity in this new Internet age. Mixing an equal blend of statistics, charts and commentary, Anderson uses Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, Netflix and other new age entities in describing the revolution in the buyers' entertainment options and our thirst for choice. The ancien regime of filtering news, opinion, entertainment, consumer buying choices is dead, according to Anderson. As revealing as \\"The World is Flat\\" by Tom Friedman, this book describes like no other the new age of niche selection, user choice and the shifted sands of our preferences as a plugged in society.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Just finished watching it.  It really was terrific.  Some reviews are right, it has similar time travel themes from some of the shows, but it is done in new places and in new ways.  Seeing the cast from the past was great as well.  Definitely worth it, you'll want to watch it again soon after the first!
B000002UB3|5.0|Following the relative failure of the \\"Let It Be\\" project, John, Paul, George, and Ringo were able to get back together to make music one last time, and named their final LP, released in the fall of 1969, for the location of the EMI studios in which they had done the vast majority of their recording--somehow, an appropriate gesture. The late George Harrison's songwriting was peaking just as the Fab Four were disintegrating as a group--he contributed the album's two best songs, and, with \\"Something,\\" finally got the A-side of a Beatles single. The second side's medley is a masterful interweaving of varied song fragments, none really strong enough to stand on its own, into a rich musical tapestry--like master chefs creating a gourmet meal out of leftovers in the refrigerator.  \\"Her Majesty\\" is a brief anticlimax; the group, knowing it was dying, didn't want anyone crying at the end.  Down came the curtain.

0765318741|5.0|Just like many end of times tales, this book is the survival of one man alone in the world. However, what makes this book stand out from the others is the inner monologue of the character. Seeing how Robert Neville's psychological well being changed throughout the book was interesting-one chapter he would have it all together, the next he was crushing a glass in his hand out of frustration.<br /><br />I also appreciated the fact he was a man of regular intelligence in the book. He didn't know what he was doing when it came to the experiments and all the knowledge he gained took a lot of painstaking work.<br /><br />The ironic twist at the end where Neville ends up being more feared than he was at those he was hunting was also great, this is one aspect of the book that the movie really should have incorporated.
B00005MP58|5.0|This version is the best film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice you can find. It is almost as good as the book itself! Do yourself a favor and watch it, especially if you've already seen the recent movie with Keira Knightley.
0307276902|5.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. I felt very connected and found myself going through all of the same feelings. I don't care if the story isn't true because it is a book and I believe it is technically classified as fiction so no one is really lying to you if it was made up. It is a good book about addiction and what it can do to lives, friends, and families. I would also have to say that I would find one disturbing thing about this book would be that it would seem to encourage addiction recovery as something that you can do alone which in most cases (if not all) is not possible.
B0017MO10U|4.0|I was a bit disappointed with Ark of Truth.  The actors did a great job, but there were too many gaps in the story.  This, however, was a really, really good film.  It was fantastic to see so many people brought back for this one.  The special effects were great, and the actors did a great job, too.    It wasn't perfect, however.    People vanishing from an altered timeline...  That just doesn't happen.  There are infinite possible universes out there, and when travelling through time, you create a new branch.  You don't destroy things in the parallel universes.  It's a fundamental part of the Stargate universe.    Ignoring that, however, the film is terrific.  If you need your SG-1 fix, with plenty of action, special effects, and cast members, this delivers.  Great job by everyone.    Sci-fi Channel, Please make more!  Everyone else, Please buy this so they will!
B00127RAJY|4.0|Im only on my 2nd week and already I feel stronger...I have not lost any lbs mind you but already feel leaner.  Im 5'5 1/2 and weigh about 150.. would like to lose about 20lbs which I was at last year before I quit smoking.  This workout is tough but I LOVE that its only 20 minutes. Im sweaty and weak afterwards, getting ready to move up to level 2 tomorrow.   I doubt the 20lb claim unless you do a really restrictive diet, which I am not, but Im also watching my calorie intake as well.  Good luck to everyone in their fitness goals.. I def. recommend this so far.
B001BWDG0W|5.0|Was dragged to the cinema by my wife, thought this was just a soppy woman`s film.   I was wrong, I really enjoyed it and some of the musical scenes were a joy, kept catching my self foot tapping on the floor.    I thought ALL the cast sang well, the dance sequences were excellent.   I have never seen a cinema audience so reluctant to leave after the film was finished.   The encore at the end was great fun.  Now in the process of downloading the soundtrack - even if it is missing a couple of songs.    Thi reminded me of a couple of the old \\"There is no Business Like Show Business Era.    Brian Valente
B001B71NOI|3.0|This album seems like it was rushed into production and had some left of tracks from past albums tossed in as filler. Overall, i would say check out other pieces of work from NIN's back catalog before diving into this one if you are new nine inch nails.<br /><br />\\"Head Down\\" and \\"Demon Seed\\" are the two main highlights of this album. \\"1,000,000\\" is a good track too, but it doesnt hold ground like the other two tracks mentioned before. \\"Discipline\\" is a fun dancy kind of track with a good beat and \\"Echoplex\\" is a excellent track as well. \\"Letting You\\" is the heaviest track on the album and is a favorite of mine. The rest seem like the \\"filler\\" tracks to me. \\"Corona Radiata\\" (a track i skip just about every time i play this CD) is pretty much a left over track from the \\"Ghosts\\" series and the same can possibly be said about \\"The Four Of Us are Dying\\". \\"Lights in the Sky\\" is pretty much the \\"Hurt\\" for this album....boring and dull and is another track i skip just about everytime i listen to this CD.<br /><br />Overall, its not the greatest NIN album to date. If you was some of the more excellent stuff TR has produced, look at getting your hands on \\"The Downward Spiral\\" or \\"The Fragile\\".

B000OPPBEQ|5.0|The Matrix (5 stars out of 5)<br />Still one of the most original and difinitive cyberpunk sci-fi films ever made.  The story is fresh, stylish, and original.  The filming style is great.  Action and special effects are completely smashing.  Characters are great.  Writing is awesome and thought-provoking.  Music is good.  A definate must-see for everyone.<br /><br />The Matrix Reloaded (4 stars out of 5)<br />This continuation has greater action and special effects, but a weaker and somewhat confusing story (it took me two or three viewings to fully understand).  But it still has a good plot, good characters, great settings, cool style, good use of mythology and philosophy, and great writing.  But it is weaker.<br /><br />The Matrix Revolutions (5 stars out of 5)<br />Most people hate this one.  Although not very big on plot or dialogue, this finale has some of the best fight scenes and battles.  Characters are still good, and there's stronger theological themes evident.  It's completely exciting from beginning to end (even though the ending is a little anticlimactic; most people find it dissapointing).<br /><br />The Animatrix (5 stars out of 5)<br />A wonderful collection of short stories made by multiple anime directors, all in different styles.  Includes a few good tie-ins to the films (most prominently, the movies' prequel).  Some parts have great action, other parts are thought-provoking.  All episodes are visually awesome.  Great soundtrack, too.  Not only is it a good addition to the Matrix, it's also a good introduction to anime in general.<br /><br />Altogether, the Matrix saga is one of the best.  It ranges from being fantastically exciting to deeply thought-provoking.  As complex as the story, writing, and filming is, each new viewing of all films reveals something new.  The only real bad thing is that the sequels get a little too incomprehensible, and the action scenes may be too fantastic for some people.  Everybody should still check it all out at least once, for it is very excellent film-making.<br /><br />This box set will have loads of special features; pretty much all of the same ones from previous releases of the Ultimate collection.  This will include oodles of commentaries, trailers, music videos, featurettes galore, galleries, additional scenes from the \\"Enter the Matrix\\" computer game, and the MTV movie awards skit (woohoo!).  It amounts to 35 hours of bonus material.  They are all presented in standard definition, not HD.<br /><br />Video and sound quality on the movies are splendid.  They are clear, sharp, and have vivid colors.  Each movie comes in its own thin case, with another case devoted to additional extras (2 discs, one of which is double-sided).  The first \\"Matrix\\" movie comes with a digital copy.  It is all contained in a small sturdy black box with a glossy finish.

0060855924|1.0|Pros:  A few lines that made me crack a smile.      Cons:  No plot, random and confusing, not very funny, beats any decent jokes into the ground.      This book is confusing from the beginning.  It introduces a large number of forgettable, ridiculously named characters and places in the first ten pages or so.  It then proceeds into a storyline where one event never seems to connect to another.  Just as I begin to get into one scene, the story shifts to another unrelated one, making the book very hard to follow.  We move from one setting to another, but the story never seems to go anywhere.  Instead of ending, the books just stops.  Which is probably a blessing in disguise.    This book's worst crime, however, is that it is not funny.  It satirizes fantasy in some of the most predictable ways possible -- we've got Rhincewind, the inept mage, Twoflower the reckless tourist, Hrun the stupid barbarian -- you get the picture.  Nevertheless, Rhincewind and Twoflower might actually be decent characters if the confused storyline didn't constantly overshadow them.      There were a few -- a very few -- jokes in this book that made me crack a smile, but every time Pratchett gets a decent joke he beats into the ground mercilessly.  A giant freaking turtle that pulls the sun may be mildly amusing the first time.  It is just annoying the fiftieth time.      In the spirit of full disclosure, I will say that British humor is not really my thing.  Maybe if it was, I would like this book better, but I still cannot imagine giving it one of these rave reviews.      I love fantasy and I love humor, but this book was a huge disappointment.
B0019EXZY4|3.0|The Good Things<br />*A few bits of excitement.<br />*Good, solid filming style.  Colors and textures are rough and gritty, and even though the camera shakes around a little, it's not too overwhelming.<br />*Storyline is straightforward.<br />*Acting is not bad.  A few good lines.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Has its slow parts, and ultimately, there's not many memorable scenes.<br />*Characters are not very well developed, and are forgettable.<br /><br />This film is pretty well-made, and is sure to please most people.  I found it a bit dull, especially when compared to other capers like \\"Oceans 11\\" or \\"The Italian Job.\\" Still, it is mildly satisfying and entertaining.  Fans of these kinds of films will certainly enjoy it.<br /><br />The disc has good video and sound quality.  The single-disc edition has a commentary, a couple of featurettes, and a trailer (does include some information on the real-life heist).  The two-disc version includes the digital copy of the film (may have some other featuettes too, but I'm not entirely sure).

B000WGWQG8|5.0|Each night I turned on the HBO feature anxious to see a good dramatic series, and learn about my country's struggle for life through one its most underrated founding fathers, John Adams.<br /><br />Paul Giamatti's performance in the title role is much in dispute as he, like many other actors, seems to play himself as much as his character. He turns from a loving father to the lawyer and representative who sometimes looks apoplectic rather than just an angry or fiery patriot. Much to his credit, I felt the John Adams of later years on subsequent episodes was extremely well-acted.<br /><br />Abigail Adams is played by Laura Linney, and her performance is superb and not the least in dispute. From the first moment, she is thoroughly credible as the vivacious lover, friend, confidante, advisor, and wife of John Adams. Her acting here should garner her an Emmy. The actors protraying Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson turned in stellar performances.<br /><br />Many complain that this did not follow the book of the same title, and  was not true to history exactly. To the first query the answer is what does? To the second, it is a well-written and well-acted drama that deserves our attention.<br /><br />The series begins with the Boston Massacre and John Adams representing the British soldiers. With his successful defense, he is noticed by the Crown, as well as the colonials who are striving for independence. Both want his services. Adams chooses independence over the king and we see him as representative, foreign minister, beggar and borrower, ambassador, vice president, and president. His one anchor through these assignments and occupations in the struggle of a new nation is his love and respect for his wife, Abigail whom he always refers to as \\"my friend.\\" The letters between the two is one constant that sustains their love through loneliness of separation, as Mr. Adams is more often away than home.<br /><br />Particularly touching is the drab existence they share in an uncompleted White House, the grief John Adams suffers from the loss of his Abigail, his renewed friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and his dying belief that his friend survives him, even though Jefferson died three hours earlier. In one of the ironies of our history, both men died exactly fifty years to the day, after July 4, 1776.<br /><br />This story ends with both Abigail and John Adams quoting letters of their love for each other and a young nation, as they ascend a hill together and look out over their country. They hope that they will be able to see future generations of Americans, from heaven, and wonder if they will deserve the sacrifice and freedom they have given them.<br /><br />So do I.ohn Adams suffers from the loss of his Abigail, his renewed friendship with Thomas Jefferson, and his dying belief that his friend survives him, even though Jefferson died three hours earlier.

It was not their best effort but it was still Stargate.

0930289234|5.0|After a long time of not reading this novel, and after reading the first 50 pages of Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' \\"Watchmen,\\" I immediately thought of another recent \\"superhero\\" story of sorts, \\"Hancock,\\" and a quote Cherlize Theron said very matter-of-factly in the film - \\"(We've been called) gods, angels, and different cultures and different eras have called us many things - in this place and time we are called super heroes.\\"<br /><br />Alan Moore's depressing and outright blasphmeous story of the \\"superhero\\" and their struggles with humanity, as they also deal with the after-effects of modern day god-worship, the ordinary people's eventual fear and hatred of them, etc. made me wonder if Alan himself didn't realize that he was showing us a mirror to ourselves and our blind worship of them, and for this I love his idea and the concept, stretched out originally over 12 \\"chapters,\\" now all collected here for the first time together.<br /><br />This is not the story of a Super-man, or a Spider-man, who do not exist here in this world (except as minor comic book characters pasted on the wall as a sad reminder) and as we all know, these 'heroes' were created by an foreign & alien environment. This is a very real story of regular people who are dealing with their chosen fates - they have chosen stand up to the corruption of the world and to defend and protect the common citizen as they were once themselves, with the exception of the only one \\"true\\" superbeing of the bunch, Dr. Manhattan, who has problems of his own. They all had noble ideas and the spirit to try, but in the end are exiled, murdered or shuttered up and driven into the shadows by the very people they once defended.<br /><br />This story, set against the angry and unsettling backdrop of an alternate world of 1985, where Nixon (!) is still President, the Cold War is growing hotter and hotter by the page, Vietnam was won unconditionally by the U.S. (thanks in part to Dr. Manhattan and The Comedian), America invades Afghanistan against protective Russia, and the entire backdrop melts away and is boiled down to one main subject - this is a mystery novel wrapped up in a bloody American flag.<br /><br />Someone is killing off or trying to destroy the former members of \\"The Crimebusters,\\" a group formed right before World War 2. One of the remaining active (and illegally practicing) members, Rorschach, is not only trying to solve the whodunit of who's ding it but is also trying to possibly get the remaining forced to retire members (due to 1977 government legislation outlawing them) to band together one last time to discover why it's happening.<br /><br />But there's a problem - some of them are just too afraid to try any more. Once revered, they hide in shadows, living boring and uninteresting lives or shilling their once-fame to sell action figures of themselves. Along the way there are flashbacks, using a manuscript from a 'tell-all' book revealing the ugly truths about some of the members written by one of them (\\"Under the Hood\\") and very very strange and hidden clues along the way, the story gets more and more negative and paranoid.<br /><br />In this universe there are instances of out-and-out murders of characters, attempted rape, racism, horrible forms of gung-ho vigilantism, homophobia and xenophobia and so much more depravity unheard of in comic books seen in any form like this until this was written.<br /><br />The comic was drawn by Dave Gibbons in a classic style, using a fictional comic book (\\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\") to tell an even more horrible story, strange newspaper headlines and interviews to propel the story to it's hard and stunning climax.<br /><br />However, it's the story by Alan Moore who debunks the myth by prying open the ugly dark side of the \\"superhero.\\" In each chapter each former member has a moment to shine, to see and hear their story, and then the rest of the world comes crashing down on them again.<br /><br />I don't want to keep droning on and on about too much more, as I don't want to give anything away and besides, any comic reader worth his salt has already read it, or if you haven't, you should. Every preconceived notion you've ever had about \\"superheroes\\" will be torn away from you, every backstory you think you've ever read that you thought was fascinating about a \\"superhero\\" will wither and dissipate against the weight of this.<br /><br />I first read this back in 1986 when it first came out and I was a whopping 22 years old, and I was shocked and angry at the way Alan rattled the cages, but now, looking back in retrospect, I applaud him as he taken strands of different stories like this that were laying around (parts of this comic made me think of an earlier attempt to \\"tug on Superman's cape\\" titled \\"Superfolks\\" from 1977 - look for it, it's hard to find) and laced together the greatest of all comic novels.<br /><br />I'll even go so far as to say it's better in scope and feel than \\"The Dark Knight Returns.\\"<br /><br />This series pulls you in and won't let you go, and every time I've read it since, I still get those pangs of anger and uneasiness from knowing that comic books, originally designed for kids, doesn't mean that they'll understand subtlety or violence in it's own context.<br /><br />To understand this novel is to get the whole idea of the new comic book as they had a re-birth in the late 80s - they're not just all \\"wham\\" and \\"bam\\" anymore. We go behind the masks into the very soul of the hero, and to say he or she is not flawed at all is the same as saying we aren't, either.<br /><br />These heroes bleed, they have real problems, they use drinking and drugs to blur it out, they fight amongst themselves (as most of humanity does in most instances), yet pull it together just long enough to save the world. Or in the case of \\"Watchmen\\", do they?<br /><br />This is essential reading for anyone who wants to go beyond the flashy costumes and the garish colors to feel what our modern-day gods are feeling as they kill for their view of righteousness, and this is as close you'll ever get to that.oning on and on about too much more, as I don't want to give anything away and besides, any comic reader worth his salt has already read it, or if you haven't, you should.

B0002F6AH0|3.0|This is a pretty good history of the Word War II period, and a very good compilation of contemporary films.  But it's not up to the level of a serious history of the military or political aspects of the conflict.  By comparison, the 1994 television series \\"Battlefield: World War II\\" is a lot more intelligent and provides better detail of the actual military campaigns.
0066620996|1.0|This book by Jim Collins is one of the most successful books to be found in the \\"Business\\" section of your local megabookstore, and given how it purports to tell you how to take a merely good company and make it great, it's not difficult to see why that might be so. Collins and his crack team of researchers say they swam through stacks of business literature in search of info on how to pull this feat off, and came up with a list of great companies that illustrate some concepts central to the puzzle. They also present for each great company what they call a \\"comparison company,\\" which is kind of that company with a goatee and a much less impressive earnings record. The balance of the book is spent expanding on pithy catch phrases that describe the great companies, like \\"First Who, Then What\\" or \\"Be a Hedgehog\\" or \\"Grasp the Flywheel, not the Doom Loop.\\" No, no, I'm totally serious.    I've got several problems with this book, the biggest of which stem from fundamentally viewpoints on how to do research. Collin's brand of research is not my kind. It's not systematic, it's not replicable, it's not generalizable, it's not systematic, it's not free of bias, it's not model driven, and it's not collaborative. It's not, in short, scientific in any way. That's not to say that other methods of inquiry are without merit --the Harvard Business Review makes pretty darn good use of case studies, for example-- but way too often Collins's great truths seemed like square pegs crammed into round holes, because a round hole is what he wants. For example, there's no reported search for information that disconfirms his hypotheses. Are there other companies that don't make use of a Culture of Discipline (Chapter 6, natch) but yet are still great according to Collins's definition? Are there great companies that fail to do some of the things he says should make them great? The way that the book focuses strictly on pairs of great/comparison companies smacks of confirmatory information bias,which is a kink in the human mind that drives us to seek out and pay attention to information that confirms our pre-existing suppositions and ignore information that fails to support them.    Relatedly, a lot of the book's themes and platitudes strike me as owing their popularity to the same factors that make the horoscope or certain personality tests like the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator so popular: they're so general and loosely defined that almost anyone can look at that and not only say that wow, that make sense, and I've always felt the same way! This guy and me? We're geniuses! The chapter about \\"getting the right people on the bus\\" that extols the virtue of hiring really super people is perhaps the most obvious example. Really, did anyone read this part and think \\"Oh, man. I've been hiring half retarded chimps. THAT'S my problem! I should hire GOOD people!\\" Probably not, and given that Collins doesn't go into any detail about HOW to do this or any of his other good to great pro tips, I'm not really sure where the value is supposed to be.    It also irked me that Good to Great seems to try and exist in a vacuum, failing to relate its findings to any other body of research except Collins's other book, Built to Last. The most egregious example of this is early on in Chapter 2 where Collins talks about his concept of \\"Level 5 Leadership,\\" which characterizes those very special folks who perch atop a supposed leadership hierarchy. The author actually goes into some detail describing Level 5 leaders, but toward the end of the chapter he just shrugs his figurative shoulders and says \\"But we don't know how people get to be better leaders. Some people just are.\\" Wait, what? People in fields like Industrial-Organizational Psychology and Organizational Development have been studying, scientifically, what great leaders do and how to do it for decades. We know TONS about how to become a better leader. There are entire industries built around it. You would think that somebody on the Good to Great research team may have done a cursory Google search on this.    So while Good to Great does have some interesting thoughts and a handful of amusing or even fascinating stories to tell about the companies it profiles (I liked, for example, learning about why Walgreens opens so many shops in the same area, even to the point of having stores across the street from each other in some cities), ultimately it strikes me as vague generalities and little to no practical information about how to actually DO anything to make your company great.
B00005B36H|4.0|Tool's third album may be their best; certainly it is great. Very happy with it and it stands up to repeated listening.
B000RZGIOA|5.0|love this movie and again one i have not seen for a while, i liked the story and thought it was well done, and the blu-ray copy just blew me out the window very nicley done, on the whole enjoyed this movie more than some of the movies that have come out latley.
B000YAA68W|5.0|When the story begins Marjane is ten year old. Just when the Shah is defeated and it seems some freedom may be restored to Iran a fundamental Islamic group comes to power and dashes all hope. So the viewer learns to navigate such dodgy waters as Marjane does, including what it means to be female under such a smothering regime, how one comes to terms with her own feelings of hatred and frustration, and how to find a way to thrive when everything around you opposes it.<br /><br />Try as she might, Marjane just can't keep her rebellious self under wraps and her parents feel it's best to send her to Europe to be educated. Meeting a very different kind of adversity there, Marjane comes to see just what freedoms she has missed out on and how western culture doesn't even know how blessed it is. Upon returning to Iran as a young adult Marjane falls into a deep depression, leading to a rocky marriage and sad realization that while she genuinely loves her homeland she knows she will never prosper there.<br /><br />Based on the autobiographical graphical novel of the same name, Persepolis is brilliantly done. Written and directed by Marjane Satrapi, herself, the coming-of-age story allows us to grow and develop with the young heroine, to feel frankly the hurt of a child's dreams not realized in the adult's life. The stark and contrasting black and white animation is evocative and powerful, no doubt a mirror to having grown up in a place that as much creates open space for growth it also embodies the restricting darkness that inhibits it. All told this film isn't bleak or heavy in political preaching. It gives insightful commentary on how cultural change affects every facet of life and offers inspirational footing for how to greet it with integrity.
B00177Y9ZC|5.0|Having witnessed human teleportation first hand once while walking around a lake near my house, I therefore liked this movie a lot.  Those super powers were cool, and I know that this movie is indeed factually based upon real things since I have experienced them myself. Kudos to the writers/producers for revealing this stuff to the general public at large, man. I couldn't understand half the things spoken by Griffin (Jamie Bell) but the action made up for this small problem.  Diane Lane looked kinda old, man.  Other than that, it was a great trip man.  I was on the edge of my seat inside my man cave while I watched.  I thanked God several times during the movie for such a wonderfully done film.  Thanks God!

B0010358CQ|4.0|Reviewed by MJ Twain<br /><br />John Woo and Shinji Aramaki's futuristic tale of cyborgs, bioroids, and humans spotlights the E.S.W.A.T. force of Olympus, a post-apocalyptic city.<br /><br />Governments from around the world are about to join in a massive satellite-sharing operation. Terrorists attack from unexpected directions, causing turmoil in the city. The core of the E.S.W.A.T. team faces not only their biggest mission, but their most intimate challenge ever. Deunan, a hard-charging human, Briareos, her cyborg partner and love interest, and Tereus, the bioroid fashioned from Briareos's DNA must overcome excruciating obstacles to ensure the peace and safety of not only Olympus, but the world.<br /><br />The motion-capture technology used for this film is much improved from earlier incarnations. Characters' body movements were the most natural I've seen so far. Unfortunately, the animation style felt far more appropriate to a gaming environment than a movie. My fingers got twitchy in expectation of game play that, of course, never happened. This blended animation style continually pulled me from the story so I could check out where they splurged or skimped on detail (ie: fine facial movements verses chunky locks of hair).<br /><br />As to the story, I found the love triangle an interesting byplay to the larger situation. A conflicted Deunan deals with two versions of the same man. Set within the bigger frame of a terrifying social meltdown, this emotional situation adds tension to an already difficult day.<br /><br />For the most part, the story was believable. Certain elements were predictable, but they were presented in a manner that will leave anime fans satisfied.<br /><br />Hardcore fans might find this film a bit off the pace at times, but, overall, it'll be a fun title to add to your collection.<br /><br />4 out of 5 Discs
B0012Q732O|5.0|I bought the musical score for it.  I enjoyed the music.  I liked how it was sort of a Eurasian Apocalypto, very cool.  The whole man connecting with beast thing was cool.  The Nephilim hanging out in the yet to be built Pyramid City was most excellent, I thank God for that scene.  There are a number of things in this movie that I would thank God for. The Mammoths, the gnarly cave dudes and dudettes.  That was one awesome spear that the tribal leader got to carry!  Most excellent and a big thanks to God for that as well.  Overall, I enjoyed it and that's what counts.  I thank God for the time I spent viewing this beautiful and historical journey back to the days of yore.  Thanks God!

B0000VCZK2|5.0|The Alien saga is the best there is, even better that Star Wars, Matrix, Harry Potter, Lord of The Rings, you name them. There is one thing that bugs me, in Alien 1 at the very begining, there is a huge petrified Alien sitting while holding a  big gun! who is he? There's gotta be an explanation of how everything started. If they were to create another film, they should go way back and come out with a story of how everything started. For what I understand their native planet was destroyed and migrated to other planets wiping off everything on their path. I hope to see this coming anytime soon.
0553804677|5.0|Scott Lynch along with Patrick Rothfuss (The Name of the Wind) will rock your world!!! two of the greatest first novels from two of the greatest promises in the literal fantasy world. Ok, it sounds like \\"too much\\" indeed, but after you read \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" perhaps you will understand the great feeling that a great book leaves in you. You will be transported to a different and raw world. A world where you better be alert or you could probably loose all of your money or worst, your life.    Scott Lynch has created an incredible world of MAFIA, assasins, dark magic, and dark humor at its best. This wonderful and well plotted book will leave you wanting more and more. I've already ordered the next book \\"Red Seas under Red Skies\\". I truly hope that the sequel retains the magic of the 1st one. Indeed \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" owns a special spot on my personal collection. Cheers.
B0017MO10U|4.0|I'm probably what would be considered a hard-core fan: I own all 10 seasons of the show on DVD and even some of the Fandemonium books. I watch episodes daily. I also think the show should have ended with the episode Threads and am not a big fan of the story ark in seasons 9 & 10 (don't like the Ori).    I was really excited about this movie and had been waiting impatiently for the DVD to come out for the past couple of months. I finally got the DVD yesterday and watched it last night with my husband, who enjoys the show (but is definitely not a hard-core fan). I did try to tone down my enthusiasm before watching the movie as I knew I was likely to be disappointed.    I did not enjoy Ark of Truth that much since I don't like the Ori, but I have to say I was not disappointed with Continuum. There were a few bits and pieces that bothered me and I'll have to find out if the things they did jive with the SG universe as we know it, and I always get confused with alternate timelines. But the movie was definitely enjoyable. It had a different feel from just a 2-part episode. The camera angles were different, the Arctic scenes were pretty cool. I'll definitely watch it again.    RDA's role was pretty minimal. I thought he was a bit too out there in the first and last scenes, but I did enjoy the scene with him & the team in the sub. That seemed more like the Jack of the early SG1 seasons.     I found the music to be a little too \\"there\\" at times, especially at the beginning of the movie. Basically, I noticed the music and wondered whether we really needed it. Might just be me over-analyzing things though.    I haven't watched all of the extras yet, but the \\"making of\\" extra was pretty nice and long, a definite improvement over the barren DVDs of the early seasons.    All in all, though, a good enjoyable movie. Hopefully the next one will be at least as good!
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is absolutely the best Batman portrayal outside of the source material, and surely one of the top three or four superhero films ever made.<br /><br />Despite some significant revisions to the character's universe, the film gets the most important aspects right. Done properly, Batman is Dirty Harry,  a film noir detective, a ninja, James Bond, a captain of industry, and Dracula combined into one terrifying figure. \\"Batman Begins\\" comes as close as anything I've seen to fulfilling that vision.<br /><br />\\"The Dark Knight\\" is great Joker movie. This is a great Batman movie.
B0013FXWU6|3.0|I avoided all of the overblown hype of the movie when it was in the theater and watched it on DVD instead. I am really surprised by all of the 5 star movie reviews, as I felt the movie was just average. The only above average category would be in acting, particularly Daniel Day-Lewis.    The movie slowly, and I mean slowly, starts with Plainview (Lewis) down in a hole chopping at rock and finding some oil. During the first 20 minutes, dialogue nonexistent, we get to watch Plainview become obsessed with oil and his interaction with his son. The movie progresses a few years ahead and apparently Plainview has been successful in oil and is more greedy than ever for more leases and land to conquer. Basically, this IS the cycle that takes you from the beginning to the end (at a very bloated 2hrs. 30min. +).     Perhaps the most troubling part is the relationship between Plainview and his son. For the early part of the movie, the relationship is close and he treats his son like his best friend. Then a period of years goes by and an accident happens, causing Plainview to basically abandon his son. Then his son comes back everything is fine, and then it flashes ten years into the future and Plainview is showing full hatred of his son again. If the director was trying to show Plainview as a complete jerk, he succeeded, but the movie would have been much stronger had the relationship been constant, while everything else was happening around them. Obviously, there were enough scenes to show that Plainview was a not-so-great person, that the dissolution of his relationship with his son was overkill.    As to Daniel Day-Lewis' acting, it is superb and the best part of the movie. He plays a conflicted character, who you may like one minute and detest the next. The other actors play their parts well, particularly the actor who plays the son and the young, rather crazy minister.     The overall pacing and plot seem to be the major issues, not to mention a dull, uninspired score. (Ithas one of the most annoying sections where it literally grates on your nerves and sounds more like a sound effect than music). The pacing jumps all over and the transition from one time period to another seems like bad editing. The plot is ambiguous at times and some of the scenes try to make sense but actually have you scratching your head (even after the movie ends). Oh, the ending really will leave you scratching your head.    It suffers from the old \\"we made it to 2hrs., now we need to wrap this thing up quick\\" syndrome. Honestly, the last 35min. of the movie will leave you wondering what the point of the movie was other than to give Daniel Day Lewis a movie to do what he does best, which is fine acting.
B001CD6FKS|1.0|I absolutely LOVED Speed Racer when I saw it in the movie theater, though many of my friends didn't know what the fuss was about.  I couldn't wait to get it into my blu-ray player when it was released.  But unfortunately, Warner isn't giving this movie the proper treatment.  They are using compressed video and not lossless audio (BD-25 instead of BD-50, etc.)  This should have been a reference disc for Blu-ray, but they are going cheap because it didn't fare that well among the other summer blockbusters.  What a shame!  The BEST thing about this movie is the audio/visual aspects of it, and they're not going to do it justice.  May as well get the DVD.
B0010YSD7M|2.0|Not a very creative story line... lots of repeats of themes from the tv show... not very creative dialogue... visually ok, effects and stuff, but predictable finish to story arc, I figured it out in first 20 minutes... blah de blah blahh...
0141439580|4.0|Like most of Jane Austen's novels, the theme is around young women and how to obtain marriages with suitable men and be in love with them at the same time.  In Emma, we have a heroine who not just sits around and speculates on who would pair up with who, but actively strives to influence and guide the matchmaking.  She takes on a protege, Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage and sees into every interaction with the various gentlemen, more than is actually there.  Unfortunately for poor Harriet, whose emotions get tangled around various men \\"who are all above her socially\\", Emma learns that manipulation and scheming is doing more to hurt her dear friend than to have left things alone.<br /><br />The reason I read this book as a mystery, is that the reader is left to speculate (without peeking) which man would pair up with which lady.  There are red herrings, where the characters other than Emma, misspeculate, to lead the reader into examining the clues to see if it were the case.  Also, one of the male characters purposely set out to mislead where his affections are placed, and there is also a misunderstanding between Emma and Harriet on which gentleman she admires, with Emma giving encouragement because of mistaken identity.<br /><br />The scheming finally crashes to a sequence of revelations brought about by a sequence of events.  One after another, the couples pair off with a sequence of marriages, assuring the reader that the correct matches were made and happiness for the future guaranteed.  Even though the middle of the book is very slow, the reader can go back and look at the clues and events after knowing the ending to see where inclinations rested and secrets lay buried.
B0017MO10U|3.0|TV ad led me to believe O'Neil (Anderson) would be \\"Leading the SG Team...\\" - false advertising at the least! Story is better than \\"Ark\\" but I was expecting more from my favorite character!
B00133KFGW|5.0|Evan aka August is an orphan boy gifted with musical talents.  He hears musical tones in ordinary noises all around him and feels it in his bones.  This is a delightful story about how he finds his parents, two musically gifted people, who don't know his existence.  Aside from the great soundtrack, the juxtaposing of classical cello and electric guitar, and the riffs Evan/August creates on his guitar, there is also the poignant searching of Evan for his parents, and later his mother for him, and his father for his mother.  The three souls are joined and connected through music.  This is definitely a movie that you can watch over and over again, because of the freshness of the music, and rooting for the orphan to find his parents despite his circumstances.
B000EWBKKI|4.0|A decent disc at a great price. I think it was about $12 + shipping. The video is not a huge improvement over the special edition DVD. It doesn't have a lossless audio track and it is the original theatrical release not the longer special edition DVD.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Interesting version of the original Willie Wonka.  The kids wanted to watch it over and over again.  Updated graphics and songs.  Loved the little boy who played Charlie--sweet spirit.

B001B71NOI|5.0|Trent Reznor has always been one to go against the flow, starting with his provocative lyrics in \\"Closer\\" to his insane and over the top tour shows, and now with a new release style.    With the massive success of Ghosts, a 4-part ambient experiment with lots of enjoyable beats and relaxing music, he offered a download of this album, \\"The Slip\\", complete with multiple formats and the added art, lyrics, and other goodies in the ID3 tags and in a PDF.    The Limited Edition is quite a treat with a couple of stickers, a bi-fold digipack with audio and video, both on opposite sides in simple, artistic fashion along with the tracklist and Halo 27/NIN designation in the center.    This is truly a classic Nine Inch Nails release, blending seamlessly between tracks varying between the fast, aggressive rock, slower, but still powerful tracks, and even ambient and glitchy tracks mixed in the middle. From the old-school \\"Discipline\\", to soft, slow \\"Lights in the Sky\\", to the insanity of \\"Letting Go\\", Reznor keeps the perfect NIN style while moving up in skill and quality.    Even if you don't get it from Amazon, go grab it from the official Nine Inch Nails site, or even via BitTorrent under the Creative Commons License.  Trent himself has been quoted, \\"We encourage you to remix it, share it with your friends, post it on your blog, play it on your podcast, give it to strangers, etc.\\"    So, go check this out, and enjoy the mastermind of this great musician and artist.

B0012K1ILW|5.0|At the time that New Amerykah Pt. 1 came out, a lot of my friends were telling me how weak the album was and  how weak I was for liking it...but I have to say, this is one of the best and most NECESSARY albums that have come out in these mid to late 2000's.  The current mainstream music was startin' to discourage me for a minute, but Erykah's album came right on time. From a musicianship standpoint, this album is nearly ingenious, with the sick basslines of \\"The Cell\\", \\"Twinkle\\", and \\"My People\\" (its minimalist approach is so effective) to the overall realness (for lack of a better word) of \\"That Hump\\".  However, it seems to me that the message has missed a lot of people (hence some of the low ratings).  As evidenced by the review title, my favorite track is \\"Master Teacher\\" ('cause the song, to those who understand its meaning/question, is powerful, and 'cause Georgia Anne Muldrow and Bilal bless the track nicely).    Many of these 2-and 1-star reviewers have begun to accept what's been comin' out in the mainstream as the norm to the point where creativity is being more frowned upon than ever.  I love the direction that Erykah's going in.  But with this coming from a die-hard Georgia Anne Muldrow fan, ya'll should see why I'm feeling the \\"Jam Session w/ a Purpose\\" vibe that Erykah's comin' with.  To some of those who don't like the album ('cause ya'll don't understand the messages-I understand that some people just don't like the album with all things being considered), look around you, read up, re-condition, and then try to \\"stay woke.\\"  If what ya'll were looking for on this album was a \\"Bag Lady\\", \\"Tyrone\\", or \\"Next Lifetime\\", etc. kinda' vibe, then why ya'll lookin'?! You already have that in your record collections ;-)
1582701709|5.0|I first bought the DVD version, but there are many details, so I decided to purchase the book in order to read it slowly and have better understanding.<br /><br />It is a nice reading, it inspired me. I strongly feel more positive now, it's great for your self esteem.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead is such a strange movie it's impossible to categorize it in any of the traditional genres.  There is a lot of gore in it to make it a slasher/horror movie, but it's so funny I would rather put in the comedy group.<br /><br />Either way this movie is FUNNY! Their are so many funny parts to it I don't know which is my favorite.  I guess the part where there killing the zombie in the bar while Queen is playing on the juke box.  AWESOME!<br /><br />This movie from start to finish is a riot!!  A lot of comedies follow the same basic gags and jokes, this movie goes in a direction that I don't think anyone has ever gone before.  And for that it deserves to be considered one of the best comedies to come along in a long time.
B00005NQCB|3.0|I bought this CD only because I couldn't find it on I-Tunes.  Crazy and Electric Blue are the strong song of the CD.
B001608QVS|5.0|Excellent video and audio quality.  If you love the Dirty Harry movies, and you have a Blu-ray player, this is a must.
0307265730|5.0|I, like other readers, felt that many of the characters and stories seemed very similar to Ms. Lahiri's other works.  While this may be the case, I found it comforting.  Though the characters are almost always Begali, they could easily be members of other groups.  I think Ms. Lahiri touches on themes common to most people: loneliness, isolation, longing, etc. Ms. Lahiri is writing what she knows and she does it well.<br /><br />I think at this point, I would expect these types of stories from Ms. Lahiri, just as people expect horror from Stephen King. Can you imagine if you read this book and it was all about Cuban immigrants in Miami?  Maybe a lot of the same themes would apply, but it wouldn't be what you'd expect.<br /><br />It's nice to open this book and find some familiar (but different) characters back in Boston (and beyond).  But once you go past the surface, there is more than the Bengali experience.  It's not the \\"Namesake\\" in small chunks or \\"Interpreter of Maladies\\" with a few new characters.<br /><br />With that said, I'd definitely recommend \\"Unaccustomed Earth\\" to those who have not read Ms. Lahiri before and those who are coming back for more.  While the settings are familiar, you don't need to have read any of her other books to thoroughly enjoy this one.  Finally, I'd say the last two related stories alone are worth the price of admission, so to speak.  Enjoy!

B000N4SHPS|4.0|Sylvester Stallone is feeling nostalgic lately. Between \\"Rocky Balboa\\" and the latest [[ASIN:B0015XHP2C Rambo]] installment, he's trying to resurrect past glories and reconfirm that his skills as a writer/director/actor are worth recalling as solid. \\"Rocky Balboa\\" goes a long way towards re-establishing Stallone's credibility for the better.<br /><br />\\"Rocky Balboa\\" is a well done, feel good sixth chapter, redeeming the sometimes absurdity of the later [[ASIN:B0006GAOGS Rocky]] films. Rocky is an older man, he's lost his Adriane but named his restaurant after her, has a son who hates living in a shadow. (Weird irony - years ago when Weird Al did a Rocky parody song to [[ASIN:B000ICM5IK Eye of The Tiger,]] he sang about Rocky opening a deli.) But 'Rock' wants one more chance to show what he's made of after a simulated \\"Then Vs Now\\" simulation shows a fight between Rocky and current champ Mason Dixon.<br /><br />Cue Bill Conti and Stallone in sweats. Virtually a tribute to previous [[ASIN:B000ICM5VM Rocky flicks]] (complete with multiple flashbacks and Burt Young/Paulie), the movie offers feel-good comments and philosophical asides like a zen-boxing Master. Rocky befriends Marie (Geraldine Hughes) and her son as an antidote to his loneliness, but is far too honorable to move beyond just helping her out. Showing the arrogant champ that the must important muscle being a real champ has is his heart. Proving to glib cynical sportscasters that age is just a number. The movie is very predictable, refuses to play into a maudlin ending, and - most importantly - absolves Stallone from the last few years of sleepwalking through his 90's movies.<br /><br />Interesting note - the filming in Philadelphia had already wrapped when a snowstorm hit that day, and the opportunity for more dramatic settings had arrived. The crew quickly grabbed a camera and filmed an impromptu re-shoot of the street-running scenes, ending with Rocky charging up the steps of the Art Museum in the driven snow.
B00024YVJU|3.0|I'm not too impressed with this album.  I've heard some earlier stuff from Eloy and thought it was a lot more exciting than what's here on Oceans.  This album is focused so much on atmosphere, that there's not really any exceptionally good songwriting to add to the atmosphere.  The vocals are passable, and that's been my overall experience with late period Eloy- a passable band with good enough musical ideas to get things done, but not good enough to compete with the more well-known space rock/prog rock bands such as Rush, Pink Floyd, and the Alan Parsons Project.      The final song on Oceans is a perfect example of a lack of interesting musical ideas.  Instead it's just a slow build-up of spoken vocals, barely noticeable keyboards in the background, and a pace that honestly needs to pick up a lot more to keep me focused on what the band is trying to create.  To be fair, the final few minutes of the final track on Oceans is pretty good, but it took over 10 minutes to get past the overlong atmospheric sections, which was just a bunch of pointless nonsense.    Stick with the earlier stuff from the band.
B000001EXR|4.0|Sometimes a band cannot walk away from their past work no matter what and KISS is not the first group to grapple with fans and concert promoters demanding classic rock over new creativity.<br /><br />From November 1995 to February 1996, Gene Simmons, Paul Stanley, Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer recorded grunge-inspired numbers, with an album slated for release in 1996. But the project was shelved when a reunion tour of the original band members was announced in April, kicked-off in June, with the year-long spectacle grossing nearly $144 million.<br /><br />But the sessions for the unreleased album still drew fan interest due to bootlegs turning up, hence the 12 songs (clocking in at a little over one hour) were officially issued in October 1997. Stanley takes the lead vocals on six numbers, with Simmons on five and Kulick on one, I Walk Alone.<br /><br />The album reached number 27 on the 1997 Billboard 200 chart and shows the band comfortably finding a Seattle groove. It would have been great to hear them build upon the new direction in future releases and bring the music to Detroit Rock City, but any plans stalled once the reunion tour became the primary focus.<br /><br />It is impossible to definitively predict the future of the group if the album was released as planned with a tour to support it. But this is an excellent reminder of the tug-of-war established rock superstars have with past fame and future ideas.
B0014XCMVM|5.0|This is probably my favorite album by Alanis and at four years since her last one, well worth the wait. Combining Alanis's rock sensibilities with techno courtesy of producer Guy Sigsworth who has previously worked with Madonna and Bjork, this is a masterful work of art. My favorite tracks include the Mid-Eastern/Indian flavored \\"Citizen Of The Planet\\" (sample lyric- \\"I am a citizen of the planet. My president is kwan yin. My frontier is on an airplane. My prisons: homes for rehabilitating.\\") which I totally relate to. John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" shares this sentiment in that rather focusing on what country one pledges allegiance to (which is all about division), we instead align with all humanity and love this Good Earth without the boundaries. The strings on this song (arranged by Sigsworth and Fiora Cutler) are incredible, sending an already fantastic song into the stratosphere. \\"I get giddy\\" indeed. If you liked \\"Baba\\" from \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" and the title track of \\"So-Called Chaos\\", you'll love \\"Citizen\\". The angst-ridden \\"Straitjacket\\" is one of the songs here that you'll want to (in Alanis's words) 'dance your face off' to. Great beat, more great lyrics that are nakedly personal, and I love the treatment the word 'straitjacket' is put through, giving the song just the right touch of insanity. \\"Versions Of Violence\\" gives me goose bumps in its depiction of a relationship that could be interpreted as either personal or universal. I love the way Andy Page's synth bass threads through the song.<br />  After a deluge of sound from the first four songs, \\"Not As We\\" simmers the album down in just the right place. Basically just Alanis singing with piano accompaniment by Guy, this is perhaps the most personal and heartbreaking song on the album. But it also has a glimmer of hope reflected in the lyric \\"From scratch begin again but this time I as I and not as we\\" which makes it all the more touching. More hope and positivity comes in the form of the subtle beauty of \\"In Praise Of The Vulnerable Man\\" which also has a glorious string arrangement. Lyrically, \\"In Praise\\" seems to be a further exploration into the territory established in songs like \\"UR\\" and \\"So Pure\\" from \\"Junkie\\". \\"Torch\\" is another very personal song concerning Alanis's breakup with Ryan Reynolds. It's musically dynamic, going from relatively minimal instrumentation to full bloom and back again. This woman is fearless when it comes to documenting emotions and her art is richer because of this openess. Another ode to positivity and happiness, \\"Giggling Again For No Reason\\" follows. It's sort of a sister song to \\"Knees Of My Bees\\" from \\"So-Called Chaos\\" and allows Alanis to show a brighter side of herself before the intensity of the swirling \\"Tapes\\" which includes the priceless lyric \\"All these thoughts in my head aren't my own wreaking havoc\\". The song ends with Alanis singing in an upper register that is heavenly. \\"Flavors\\" ends perfectly with the upbeat \\"Incomplete\\" with swirls of gorgeous background vocals and other nice flourishes of sound courtesy of Andy Page's 'sound design'. I don't know if it will offend many of her fans but I dig Alanis's perception of God as female in this song. In this white male-dominated nation, I find this notion refreshing and share it with Alanis.<br />  \\"Flavors Of Entanglement\\" shows Ms. Morissette continuing to grow as an artist.

0385340567|3.0|Five days off, and the latest Lee Child book arrives at the library...  Nothing To Lose.  Normally, this is a recipe for a great time.  This time, it seemed to be a bit off.  While I liked the return to current times with the Jack Reacher character, the plot on this episode seemed to stretch out a bit too long.  I was also less than enthralled with the subplot of missing persons, especially given the way Child chooses to have Reacher react to it.<br /><br />Reacher's on the road again, traveling (on a whim) from Maine to California with just the clothes on his back, a passport, an ATM card, and a toothbrush.  He ends up in a town in Colorado called Hope, and from there it's only 17 miles to another town called Despair.  He can't resist the urge to check out the place, so he starts walking.  When he gets into town and tries to order a cup of coffee in the diner, it's made quite clear to him that strangers are not welcome.  Telling Reacher he can't do something is like waving a red flag in front of a bull, and he refuses to leave.  This leads to one busted up local deputy and Reacher in jail for vagrancy.  They take him back to the boundary between Despair and Hope, and dump him off.  The police officer of Hope, a pretty woman by the name of Vaughn, meets him there and attempts to reason with him to just come back to Hope and ignore Despair.  But Reacher can't let it alone, and he's determined to find out why they were so determined to get rid of him.  He learns that Despair is a metal recycling company town completely owned by a single person, and Reacher figures he's got something to hide if the entire town is afraid of anyone showing up.  It also doesn't help Reacher's curiosity when he finds a military Forward Operating Base guarding one of the roads into Despair.  Things aren't adding up for Reacher, and he has no better thing to be doing than to uncover the secrets of Despair.<br /><br />On the whole, I did enjoy the return of Reacher to his post-military, drifter ways.  I'm glad that Child chose to retreat from the military flashback detour, and stay with the character that I've come to expect.  Reacher's attitude, dialog, and ability to wreck havoc in personal confrontations is all there in Nothing To Lose.  It's just the plot that seems to drag.  There's a pair of plots involving what may be going on at the recycling plant, as well as people who seem to have disappeared after showing up in Despair.  The real purpose of the recycling plant doesn't show up until the end, nor does the reason for the missing persons.  Once Reacher *does* discover the reasons for both, he goes off on a political rant that seems rather out of character.  It also places him directly at odds with Vaughn, given the personal circumstances she's dealing with.  While it isn't quite a \\"soapbox\\" novel where the entire plot is designed to support the author's personal crusade, the end sure smacked of it.<br /><br />Nothing To Lose isn't horrible, nor is it such that I'll be less inclined to get Child's next Reacher novel as soon as I can.  But I certainly hope that this is not the start of a trend...ad that Child chose to retreat from the military flashback detour, and stay with the character that I've come to expect.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I always liked Loreena McKennitt, but it wasn't until I saw her \\"Nights of the Alhambra\\" DVD that I became a real fan.  Prior to that, I was attracted by her beautiful voice and her haunting arrangements of traditional Celtic music.  But after seeing \\"Alahambra\\", I realized that she also plays several instruments with virtuousity, and is a great performer!  Now, when I listen to her new Ancient Muse DVD, I get more out of it, because it recalls the concert and makes the experience a (virtual) visual as well as an audio treat!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Gilmore girls is simply amazing. The complete series collection has additional features and also an episode guide with cool pics.
B000YAA68C|2.0|I held off on watching this movie until I had read the book. I wish I hadn't. It was very loosely based on the book. Had the movie been more like the book, it would have been fantastic.
B00005JPY0|5.0|TDK is just incomparable with Batman Begins and any other superhero movies in general incl.Spider Man 2. It's brilliant. From start to finish i was just hooked, there wasn't any dull moment in it - lots of action, tensional storytelling (believe me it didn't get draggy or even a bit chatty as some say). In fact, due to its surprisingly tight pace i couldn't quiet follow the plot although we were sort of given a heads up of what's going to happen from what the characters were saying (typical nolan's meticulous work). If there's any nitpicking, it's the action sequence coherence. don't get me wrong, the action was breathtaking but i couldn't know what was coming from where, or where who was during the action.   guess nolan's not much of an action director. in closing, we know its always a challenge to make a \\"superhero birth\\" movie 'coz you have to balance between how a superhero came to be and the action, but i bet Nolan wish they could remake \\"Batman Begins\\" and make it even more explosive.
B00003CXA2|3.0|The product itself was fine, but it took me over 10 days to receive it.  Need to improve shipping procedures.
B0018CWWLE|2.0|I was given this as a birthday gift as I am something of a fan of the group.  I was really looking forward to see it as I had missed seeing them when they came to LA.  So, imagine my surprise when I find the whole set stuffed with \\"F-Bomb\\" after \\"F-Bomb\\".  No, warning from Wal-Mart (the official supplier of the set), no warning sticker, no warning on the screen.  I was very disappointed with this product.  What then made it even worse was just past half way through the documentary on disc three, we end up with a few censor bleeps anyway, just making the whole thing seem shoty.<br /><br />If you are someone who does not care, it is a fantastic set, in truth had it been censored I would have given it higher stars, but if you are someone who does care, do yourself a favor and skip it.
B000002GFT|5.0|Liege and Lief continues to be my all time favourite album of all time!! The album came out in my senior year and since then I've worn out albums, 8 tracks and cassettes!
B000HCO83Q|4.0|First of all, I think this is a movie you have to watch two or three times to actually appreciate, since a lot of your experience the first time you watch it is \\"BANG! BOOM! CRASH!\\" In other words, this is an ACTION movie first and foremost, which means there isn't a lot of character development to speak of. Well, except for two specific characters. But I'll get to that in a minute.    Now for what I LIKED about X3:  -As screwed up as this version of Phoenix is, the Phoenix is my favorite X-Men villain, and I like the way it's been turned into an alternate personality of Jean's - it works, for the film. My personal favorite parts  were seeing her pupils dilate so much that her eyes were completely black (just an AWESOME touch, as far as I'm concerned) and the way you could kind of see a firey outline around her hair when she was backlit - it's probably an accident, but I like the subtle touch that only a diehard geek would get.  -I really enjoy Shadowcat's character. In my first viewing I had no idea who she was, but then I found out more about her and now she's one of my favorite characters. Ellen Page played this version of her with a great mix of snarkiness and sensitivity.  -Angel and Beast. Just seeing them onscreen, even with virtually no backstory, is cool.   -Iceman iced up, an iconic moment. Let's hope in any future X-Men movies he'll do it again.  -The Pyro vs. Iceman fight is a great bit, particularly since Iceman wins. (I've never been a big fan of Pyro, especially movie-Pyro, although I'll concede Aaron Stanford did a great job with the character.)  -The big battle at the end is really great, visually.  -FASTBALL SPECIAL. Even though it didn't look quite right since Hugh Jackman is too tall. But still, `nuff said.  -The Danger Room is just cool-looking. And I loved the wink-wink-nudge-nudge reference to the Days of Future Past storyline.  -About the only part that I liked of the Scott-Jean scene was when Jean held back Scott's optic blasts with her telekinesis. Another iconic moment from the comics, though naturally twisted to suit movie purposes.    And what I DIDN'T like:  -Storm's hair. I really don't get what they thought they were doing there. I mean, Storm doesn't have SHORT hair. She had a mohawk back in the 80's, but it's not the same thing.  -I don't appreciate Kitty being shoved aside to be used mostly as the third part of a stupid love triangle that was basically pointless.  -Colossus kind of didn't do anything except punch people and lug a big-screen TV around. He had more lines in X2, for crying out loud!  -The Logan/Jean \\"romance\\" is played up WAY too much. I speak as a fan who hates that particular pairing, since I'm more of a traditionalist (IE Scott/Jean), but honestly. Watching them suck face in the medical ward is just awkward.   -Mystique, who's never been my favorite but is a fascinating character, got depowered. Honestly, what was wrong with the screenwriters? They've just lost the appeal of half their male audience!   ...being serious now, I think they'll have a hard time doing X4 and beyond without Mystique in Magneto's group. And I was nursing a secret hope they'd do a reveal to Nightcrawler about who his mother REALLY is...  -Lack of character development. Essentially, all we know about Beast is that he's blue and a government official. Not a good start, if you ask me. Angel is a little better, with the opening scene showing him as a young child trying to remove his wings before his disapproving father discovers them, but still lacking in dimension. And there's NO hint of Shadowcat's genius-level intelligence, other than a short conversation she has with Professor Xavier in the classroom early on, and you wouldn't pick that up unless you were looking for it.    And what I absolutely HATED:  -Jean's killing Scott. Why is this necessary? IT ISN'T. Now, I speak as a biased fan of Cyclops, even movie-Cyclops, who is less than stellar as far as his role goes. But this 15-minute role just makesme very angry. I understand James Marsden had little time to devote to this movie on account of filming Superman Returns simultaneously, but honestly, killing off the supposed leader of the X-Men in the first half-hour is just not something you do. I wish, at least, they'd had some sort of memorial for him, even a small MENTION of him during the Professor's funeral. But no. He just disappears from everyone's minds. This is an example of bad storytelling, children. I mean, what did the Phoenix do, EAT him??  -Jean's killing the Professor. Now, I know he's not *really* dead, but I thought it was almost as stupid as killing off Scott. Honestly, in this movie THREE of the original X-Men characters, from the original team, are killed off. THREE. This, in my opinion, is inexcusable. And I don't just say that because the funeral makes me bawl like a baby every time I watch this movie either.  -Rogue's dismissal from the script. No, seriously, they gave her about 15 lines, I think. Being the character who interested me in these stories in the first place, I'm extremely irritated that she got so little screentime. And THEN she got depowered. This angers me so much that I refuse to watch the original ending, where she returns depowered, and instead opt for the deleted scene where she still has her power. I understand where the writers and director were coming from with their decision to have her take the Cure - after all, she's essentially isolated from all physical contact - but I think it was one of the stupidest moves they could have made. How will they justify her staying at the Institute in future movies if she's powerless? Or will they just have the Cure stop working, like it appeared to with Magneto in the end, which will render her choice meaningless? Or will they just kick her out and have her leave, making it less likely that some fans will go see the movies because she's not in them? (I admit, I'll be one of those fans.) There is a very simple, temporary solutionto Rogue's powers: LEECH. One of the producers talks about a scene that possibly would've been included in the movie had they chosen to have Rogue keep her powers, in which we see Rogue return and kiss Bobby, and then reveal Leech sitting outside the door with a Gameboy. I think this would've been a much better way of solving Rogue's problem while still keeping her powers for combat situations. But, no, apparently a depowered Rogue is a good Rogue.  -The explanation for the lack of character development: this became \\"The Wolverine and Jean Show\\" (as opposed to \\"The Wolverine and Rogue Show\\" that was the first two movies). Roughly 85% of the screentime was devoted to Wolverine, and Jean, or Wolverine AND Jean, which annoyed me. The title is X-MEN, not LOGAN AND JEAN. Meaning the movies are supposed to be about a GROUP. But, no, they decided to focus on those two instead and move everybody else to the backburner.    Overall, I watch this movie for the excellent special effects and action sequences, but I can't recommend it to a diehard fan of the comics on basis of the deaths of three pivotal characters (as well as two others being depowered) and lack of character development. But it's a great wiz-bang action flick, if you like that sort of thing. I really think they  should've just filmed Chris Claremont's novelization of X3 instead, because it would've been about 10 times better.    One more thing: Stick around for the end of the credits. You might see something important.
1593081081|5.0|I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition. I love the Barnes and Noble classics series! The text is highly readable and easy on the eyes (while maintaining elegance), and the covers are well bound and lovely for a paperback. Highly recommended!
B000AYELVA|4.0|Looking back on this movie now, after having watched a plethora of super hero movies, I can honestly say this is a decent movie, but not a GREAT one.     This movie was actually one of my first introductions to the world of super heroes (I'd only previously seen the first two Spider-Man movies before watching this and hadn't ever picked up a comic book) so I look back on it with a sense of nostalgia if nothing else. The plot is essentially the essence of the X-Men comics: people who were born different vying for acceptance in a world that fears and hates them, while attempting to stop the \\"villain\\" from carrying out his evil plot. (I say \\"villain\\" because I'm not really sure if Magneto counts as a villain, if you get right down to it. He and Professor Xavier are basically two sides of the same coin. But, I digress.) It has generally good acting, with one or two exceptionally excellent or horrid performances, and the script...well, it works, usually. What this movie is, more than anything, is a setup for X2, which is by far the best of the series and (in my opinion) one of the better super hero movies in existence. But this first X-Men movie is a solid effort, and a fun watch, if only because Ian McKellen or Patrick Stewart are in it (for the movie buffs) or because there are explosions (for the action fan). And even I, who is generally underwhelmed by the character of Wolverine, have to admit that Hugh Jackman played him perfectly. The only other part I've seen so well-cast is Aragorn of The Lord of the Rings.
B0013FYTA8|5.0|I bought this cd expecting it to be nothing special but i liked some of the songs on the radio and when i bought it i was plesently suprised! i can listen to the whole cd and not skip a single song. definetly worth the money to buy!
B000AYELVU|5.0|If for no other reason than that two of my favorite characters are in it (Rogue and Nightcrawler), this is my favorite of the X-Men movies. But I also appreciate the fact that it is able to balance great action sequences with great character moments, something that is hard to do in a film. The romantic in me appreciates the fact that Rogue and Bobby *finally* get to kiss, even if it's only for a moment, and the fact that Scott and Jean's bond is evident even in their few scenes together. And I like how they manage to work in Nightcrawler's circus origins from the comics, because it's an important part of the character (though I wish they'd also managed to work in his more playful side as well). I don't even mind the fact that they've spent SO much time on Wolverine's past - let's face it, the movies kind were kind of \\"The Wolverine and Rogue Show\\" from the get-go. My only complaint? Not enough Cyclops (his movie-version was sadly underused).
B000002J2D|5.0|1978 was a year that brought great change to Genesis. Longtime guitarist Steve Hackett left the band because of creative differences, and Mike, Tony and Phil were left. The band titled this album '...And Then There Were Three' for that reason. From 1976-77, the band were a quartet. Now, the band was narrowed down to a trio.    The result was some prog rock and some more pop-oriented tunes that what fuel most of their '80s material. What Genesis did not expect was this the lineup they kept from late 1977 all the way to early 1993.     But, this is a great album. It's different. Very different. Genesis was beginning to take a different approach to their music by this point. This is far different from 'Wind & Wuthering' and 'A Trick of the Tail.'    Of course, this contains the smash hit that's still played on the radio today 'Follow You Follow Me,' but there's more to this record than just that one tune. 'Undertow' is a great '70s prog-pop ballad; 'Down and Out' could have easily made the cut for 'Wind & Wuthering.'    Other great songs here is the prog-driven 'Burning Rope,' 'Scenes from a Night's Dream,' based on the 1910s British cartoon character Little Nemo and 'Deep In The Motherlode,' a keyboard-driven work song.    Overall, if you like Genesis' progressive stuff of the seventies and/or you like their poppier, radio-friendly tunes of the eighties, than '...And Then There Were Three' is a release that you will like. You might not love it, but it's one of my personal favorite records.    Highly recommended for any Genesis fan. It's a different album, unlike anything else they have done, but it's a classic, nonetheless.    ENJOY!!!
B00005JM02|4.0|This transaction was a smooth one for the most part.  Product packaged well and arrived in a timely fashion.  Somewhat disappointed in condition of DVD.  Purchased as in \\"Very Good\\" condtion.  2-DVD set.  Both DVDs skip and \\"stall\\" in DVD player due to scratches.  I used a product to try to repair them, and they do perform some better.  Deeper scratchs can't be repaired.  Keep in mind however these are \\"USED\\" DVDs.  Also individual DVD players will perform differently.  The DVDs are viewable and for the price the transaction was a decent one.  I purchased 8 used DVDs through Amazon (different sellers) recently and this is the only one I've had problems with.  I've been fortunate overall.
B0000QX0ZG|5.0|One word best describes U2's underrated 1997 album 'Pop': experimental. Their last album for Island Records before switching labels to Interscope Records in late 1998, 'Pop' is a very experimental album and is very different from their '80s material. U2 fans put it down right away, complaining that it's \\"too modernized,\\" \\"too keyboard/synth-driven\\" or \\"too computerized.\\"    I can understand why people are complaining. If you are here expecting classic '80s post punk, than look elsewhere. This album is U2 at their '90s best, and is a great follow up to 1993's 'Zooropa.' Both albums are experimental and unlike anything U2 ever did.    The highlights here for me are 'Gone,' 'Staring At The Sun,' 'Wake Up Dead Man,' 'Discotheque,' 'Do You Feel Loved' and 'The Playboy Mansion,' although there are other gems here, like 'Miami' and 'If God Will Send His Angels.'    Another really cool part of the album is the cover. Adam in blue, Bono in yellow, Larry in green and The Edge in red. It's a modern cover, with an unusual design that I don't think can be duplicated. Very cool indeed.    Overall, if you do make the decision to buy 'Pop,' don't judge it right away. You know the old saying, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\\" 'Pop' is a fine example of that. My advice is listen to it with an open mind. Listen to the album in it's entirety at least once or twice before rushing to conclusions and deciding that you hate it. If you give it a chance, it's not bad at all.    It's not one of my personal favorites from U2, but it's a great album, and I really like it. There are plenty of highlights here. Every single song on this album is great, and there are some standout songs here.    Highly recommended for die-hard U2 fans, but be warned: Not all U2 fans may appreciate this. Fans of '80s post-punk U2 might not like it too much, which is understandable. But, it's really not that bad. It's turning into a classic U2 album for me.    ENJOY!!!
1600610234|5.0|For those of you who've seen the author's art in print or person, the stars are no surprise.  If you haven't seen his work, this book not only showcases his talents and skills as a designer/renderer in finished pieces, it gives direct insight and instruction on how he gets there.  From pencil sketch to marker render to digital finished product, Doug takes you through his approach to getting an idea onto a medium.    What seperates this book from other \\"how-to\\" books in this design field is it's engaging simplicity in execution.  Doug's broken the book into easy-to-browse chapters that cover different techniques and design subject matter in each.  This is to it's benefit, as each step encompasses not only fundamental techniques of execution, but Doug's insights on the design of the subject matter.  There is little, if any, over-explaining.  The instructional images do the talking with simple text accompanying each.    Did I mention it's really hard to find a good (if any) book on marker techniques?  This one's the best I've seen.  So if you've been thinking about trying markers as a new style, this is a must have.    An all-out great purchase and true bargain considering you get a concept design, multiple-technique, step-by-step package by a truly exceptional and highly respected industry artist.
141694740X|4.0|About 4 years ago, a friend of mine gave me this book for my birthday.<br /><br />I'm a gay man and had been in a couple one-way relationships in the previous years.  My friend was tired of hearing me pine after men who were just not that into me.<br /><br />I enjoyed the read . . . applied it to my love life.  No boyfriend right now, but I FEEL much better.  Empowered.<br /><br />BUT, the biggest positive aspect of this book that I have taken from reading it was not even (at least to my knowledge) intentional on the part of the authors.  I have taken the advice of \\"He's Just Not That Into You\\" and applied it to my FRIENDSHIPS, and THAT is what has changed my life much more (and for the better).<br /><br />I'm no longer a friend who does all the calling, planning, caring, etc.  If you're my friend, you'll share those responsibilities.  Ironically, the friend who gave me the book fell into the \\"he's just not that into me\\" category, but I'll always be grateful for him introducing me to the idea.
B000002HMH|5.0|This album is incredible. Metallica's previous five albums are 'heavier' in a metal sense, but the sound in this album is anything but empty. Metallica avoided becoming a cliche with this CD, they kept their solos, they kept their full, signiature sound, but they expanded their range, musically, verbally and vocally.    A listener seeking the same music found in \\"...And Justice for All\\" or \\"Kill 'em All\\" will have to turn to those respective albums to get it; the songs here are different, and for that, \\"Load\\" received a little criticism. That doesn't make much sense when this album is wildly professional and displays the same careful craftsmanship of previous Metallica. The style of music is different, but the quality meets any and all standards set by Load's predecessors.    Load is maximum in length for a conventional studio CD, but at no point does it feel exausted, or that filler was used. The use of the name \\"Countrytallica\\" by one fan to describe the single track \\"Mama Said\\" is very appropriate, but I use it in a positive kind of way; if country had been done this nicely by its indigenous artists, it might have saved the genre!    Coming after this album, there's ReLoad, which isn't another album, but a Disc of B-sides from Load with only four or five great songs, and then the album St. Anger, which needs to be swept under the rug and forgotten. Claims that Metallica lost their edge wait to be proven in September, but the debate should begin AFTER this album, not before it.    Loaded,    -BM
B000B5XOSO|5.0|Tim Burton returns as director in the sequel to his first movie. It takes a wicked turn with the villainous exploits of the freakish and mean-spirited Penguin (Danny DeVito), whose criminal collaboration with evil tycoon Max Shreck (Christopher Walken) threatens to drain Gotham City of its energy supply. As if that weren't enough, Batman (Michael Keaton) has his hands full with the vengeful Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer), who turns out to be a lot more dangerous than first expected. Clearly, this movie is alot darker than the first one. While the first movie will always be my favorite, this movie comes in a close second.
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|It's a pop-hit, that's for sure.  But...    \\"Ur So Gay\\"?  Uhm, NO.  Substitute the word \\"black\\" or \\"jewish\\" and describe your urban or frugal ex-boyfriend and you would be blacklisted in the musical world.  I'm tired of \\"gay\\" being thrown around as a derogatory phrase.  Grow up, already.  It's not funny.    \\"I Kissed a Girl\\".  Nice catchy song.  But again, feeding into numerous stereotypes that aren't really cool, and by the way, why don't good girls kiss other girls?   Sad attempt at shock-pop.    The rest of the album is good, but not great.  Catchy tunes and music, sure, but not very memorable.  \\"Mannequin\\" amd \\"Self-Inflicted\\" stand out the most in my mind as favourite songs.  \\"One of the Boys\\" would be more enjoyable if it weren't being sung by a 23-year old, but it's something a teenage girl might dig.  But honestly, I can barely remember most of the other songs.      It's only \\"ok\\" for me.  Grow up a bit and maybe I'll enjoy it better.
0790731002|4.0|\\"Batman Forever\\" seen alot of changes made to the film series. First off, directorial duties were handed over to Joel Schumacher and the cowl of Batman was passed on to Val Kilmer. The film also marked the debut of Robin into the series(who, believe or not, Current Batman Begins star Christian Bale tried out for). This time around, Batman goes after the likes of Two-Face and The Riddler(played by Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey). While the movie is much more lighthearted in tone than anything that came before it, it was a great third installment, in my opinion. Val Kilmer did an excellent job as Batman/Bruce Wayne, playing it just as Michael Keaton had.
B0000252YK|3.0|Since Ozzy Osbourne's \\"Bark at the Moon\\" album was released in 1983; with new guitar axeman Jake E. Lee, because Randy Rhoads was very hard to replace for Ozzy. Even the thought of using Night Ranger guitarist Brad Gillis or Dokken's George Lynch were in the mix. Since guitarist Gillis played on Ozzy's \\"Speak of the Devil\\" live album. Jake E. Lee held his own playing with the hit songs \\"Bark at the Moon and Rock N' Roll Rebel\\".    In 1986 this album \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was released and Mtv rock videos were really popular. Ozzy and Jake got to be in a few classic videos; with songs \\"Shot in the Dark and Lightning Strikes\\" and with clips from the VHS live video \\"The Ultimate Ozzy\\" was also released. I think this album \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" was Jake E. Lee's better guitar work than \\"Bark at the Moon\\", even though there are just 9 songs on the album/cd. I also think songs \\"Thank God for the Bomb and Fool like You\\" really stand out.  It's worth jamming, so turn it up! I also had to order this cd import from Germany for my collection. [[ASIN:B0000252YK The Ultimate Sin]]
B000B5XOY8|5.0|It's hard to believe that stars like Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Dennis Quaid, Harrison Ford, Charlie Sheen, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Selleck and Bill Murray were all considered for Batman, at some point. It's even harder to believe that Tim Curry, Willem Dafoe, David Bowie and James Woods were considered for the Joker. Thankfully, the powers that be gave us Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson in their respective roles that made this film a classic among Batman fans. Directed by Tim Burton, Batman was a critical and financial success. The film inspired Batman: The Animated Series and a series of films. Up until the release of \\"The Dark Knight\\", it was the highest grossing film based on a DC comic book. In my opinion, this movie is the definitive Batman movie. With over 50 years of comic books to be based upon, it's the one closest to Bob Kane's original vision for Batman. Although there were three more movies to follow after this one, This movie is my most favorite out of them all. I mean, it had an all-star cast involved with it like Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Palance, and Jerry Hall. Heck, even Batman creator Bob Kane has a cameo in the movie. Who wouldn't like it?? This Two-Disc Special Edition includes features such as Audio Commentary by director Tim Burton, Legends of the Dark Knight Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight Parts 1-3 Beyond Batman Documentary Galleries, On the Set with Bob Kane featurette, and three music videos by Prince. Definitely worth getting if you're a Batman fan.
0440241413|5.0|At first I did not think I would like this book because I did not get a lot of the British talk in it. But once I got through the 3rd chapter, I was HOOKED! It is a light read, incredibly funny, and interesting. I can't wait to read the next book in the series!

B00006GEB4|5.0|I owned the original first pressing on black vinyl, and I think I like this one better.  The record itself is pressed on Red Vinyl and it's very thick, not a 180 gram pressing but a very high quality record.  I'm very impressed with this, and it's gonna be very rare and highly collectable.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've seen the play twice, once in Los Angeles and once in Las Vegas and both times it was powerful. It is really an amazing experience. When I saw the movie I thought it might take away from the play, but I was blown away. I've seen the movie many times and it just keeps getting better every time. The special CD that is also included, gives great background as to the making of the movie, and a glimpse of how the story of the phantom came about. It is a great love story, a tragic love story. It is in a sense beautiful and takes your breathe away.A MUST SEE.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|This is the greatest album ever recorded. And no, I'm not just talking in the prespective of only live albums or even hardrock albums for that matter, this is seriously the greatest work of music ever made by mankind. I don't know how to put it but \\"Strangers in the Night\\" has a certain magic, power and honesty to it that makes me wonder why rock music, or even UFO themselves, even countiued past 1978 due to the fact that NOTHING will ever be this good again. Makes me wonder how hardrock/metal bands of today can happily put out their sonic v a g i n a l execrement, knowing deep in their hearts that they will never be able to slay this F v C k I n G beast that is \\"Strangers in the Night\\". Of course it is a live album as well, I am particulary not a strong lover of live albums, however here an exception will be made. The live atmosphere allows UFO to be at their very best and unhinged to the max. The production on the studio records were less then stellar, on \\"Strangers..\\" the sound, production and preformances are not just flawless, they are superhuman, I might even say godly. Schenker's abilties with his guitar just send chills down my body. Mogg has to be the most inspiring singer too, he doesn't need a fancy costume or some stupid, trendy vocal technique, he just sings his heart out. Mogg is rock 'n' roll personified. Forget the trendy $ h ! t you've seen on T.V. about \\"RocK STaRz\\". Forget f v c k i n g wastoids like Elvis, Robert Plant or even Steve Tyler. This man, Philip Mogg, right here is the real deal, kiddies. He is by far my favorite part of the UFO machine.<br /><br />If you do not have this then your life has been meaningless up untill this point in time. Get this cd now, or forever be a mallcore baby,
B0002IQNAG|5.0|- Sure 'Night Of The Living Dead (1968)' Started It All, and its a close second to be the greatest.    - Sure 'Dawn Of The Dead (2004) Remake' is a good action-packed film, I can't deny that, probably the best (and only) good Horror Film remake of this time out there.    -  Sure 'Shawn Of The Dead (2004)' is funny as hell, maybe the most clever horror comedy since \\"Return OF The Living Dead\\"    - But more than sure 'Dawn Of The Dead (1978)' Is the best zombie movie so far, as a fan of the outtathagravewalkingcorpes flicks, having seen most of them, and owning all the above mentioned, there's no argue George A. Romero was at is peak here: Clever setting, interesting characters, cool effects (for the time, of course), and what it's most pretentios but yet so awesome: intelligent and believable plot that works both as an slowpaced action gory film and a criticism on society consumist and violence nature set in the apocalypse.    PROS: Anchor Bay has done an excellent job giving the movie what it deserves: Excelent package, 2 full lenght documentaries (you won't need anything else), interesting commentary tracks, a printed comicbook preview, all the versions of the film with audio variations including original mono, and some other minor but good extras for completist such as posters, trailer, on-screens promo material & bios, etc.    CONS: The only flaw I can see here is the lack of subtitle tracks, not only in languages such as spanish, french among others, but even not an english track is a great miss.     VEREDICT: If you are or want to become a Zombie movie fan (or Horror fan) you shouldn't live without this set,  it's the best version you'll ever get, and if they happen to release a new one, I don't know what the h-ell could it include not represented in this set.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I watched the series on HBO and wanted to have it to show my children and grandchildren.It is fabulous and will give you goosebumps watching the birth of our country. Cudos for HBO for doing this series.I hope they will be inspired to do more shows that inspire not degrade.

Strokes fans; get it while it lasts! Strokes haters: what the h-ell are you doing here?!

0784011680|5.0|This review refers to the 1998 DVD edition, the only edition available as of this writing. \\"Chaplin\\" is a well-crafted, well-acted biography of the famous silent-screen actor/comedian. The transfer of this 1993 film to DVD is adequate. The format is letter-boxed widescreen (not anamorphic--there are black bars on all sides of the image on a large-screen TV. The side bars are not seen on a smaller screen TV). The picture is fairly sharp, the colors are good, sound quality is fine. The film has an old look about it, but this was probably the intended effect. This is the kind of movie you will watch more than once, so it's worth the purchase price.  Highly recommended!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I have a whole library of workout dvd's and there are only a handful of ones I like and keep in my workout rotation.  I don't even write reviews but I have to say that Jillian's 30 Day Shred is now my #1!  You are constantly moving from one move to another and she is there to guide you the whole time.  She is not cheesy nor annoying in her instructions to you and there is no fancy choreography footwork, just basic intense cardio, strength training and abs circuit training.  You work at your own pace and increase the weights when you feel like the routine is getting easy.  Once you have mastered the first level, you go to level 2 and  then 3.  You will certainly be pleased with the workout.    I thought that only 20 min wasn't enough and I wasn't going to get a good workout.  I was WRONG!  I couldn't stop sweating and was only motivated to hang in there by Jillian.  I highly recommend this dvd for beginners to advanced since there is a challenge for everyone.
B0012Q732O|3.0|The CGI or what ever they used for the animation in the movie is excellent. The plot is a bit lightweight and the acting pretty average but the fight scenes are well thought out and filmed. Bit of a play on the idea that aliens built the pyramids with no real new twists or turns. Good one for the kids but a bit light on for the adults.
0743297334|4.0|It's difficult to review a writer like Hemingway. So often imitated, so often parodied, he practically reads like a parody of himself. One must constantly keep in mind that this guy was the original, that his distinctive style and unmoored narrative were something unique back in the day.<br /><br />To talk around things too big to say--that's another Hemingway hallmark, and in *The Sun Also Rises* the thing too big to say is World War I and the devastating effect it had on its survivors, in this instance, the characters in this novel. The war is alluded to so obliquely that its importance in fully understanding this book may elude altogether those unfamiliar with the psychic cataclysm it caused in society after 1918. At the time, Hemingway didn't need to talk about the war directly; his readers would have recognized its presence in the shell-shocked attitude of his characters immediately. Hemingway's people advance through a series of alcohol-fueled encounters with each other, speaking elliptically, insulting, apologizing, coming to blows even--it's all one unending bender punctuated by fishing and bull-fights.<br /><br />Jake, wounded in the war, has been rendered impotent--a kind of walking joke and metaphor that's none too funny. Brett is an alcoholic nymphomaniac who may ((or may not)) be driven to self-destructive excess by the inability to consummate her love for Jake. In effect, Jake is the wise, passive, philosophical eunuch at the center of this expatriate circle of friends. He is the mediating buffer between Brett's lovers, keeping the party going, as it were, defusing the potentially explosive passions around him when they don't simply fizzle out from sheer exhaustion.<br /><br />By the end of the novel, carried along by the precision of Hemingway's prose, caught up in the ennui-inducing cadences you tend to forget the imitations and parodies that have all but rendered his style a hardboiled clich&eacute;. Perhaps it'll take a long while still before Hemingway can be \\"rediscovered\\" and fully appreciated again for the master that he is. But even now the boredom, futility, and impotent despair that weighs so heavily upon the characters of *The Sun Also Rises* can be felt today; indeed it's still an enormous part of our psychic landscape nearly a hundred years later.<br /><br />If its not there already, this is a book to put on your short-list of must-read 20th century literary novels.d fully appreciated again for the master that he is.

B000YENUI6|3.0|Very much along the lines of A History of Violence - lots of violence. Anyone interested in the Russian Mafia will find this very insightful. Not the sort of movie you will want to watch over and over, but still very entertaining. Naomi Watts seems a bit light weight for her role which needed a more gritty actress in my opinion (Uma Therman would have been a better choice I thought).
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I saw this originally in theaters, and it was more than incredible.  The DVD is just as good at home. I highly reccommend it, it's some of John's greatest work - through the three \\"personalities\\" - acoustic, the trio, and with the band. It's not too expensive either, definitely worth the money!

Production is superb. From the maker of Shrek. Kung Fu Panda is another success targeted for both kids and adults. Funny and guaranteed entertainment. There are a lot of witty one liners. Lots of action. Even my 3-year old was laughing. One of those movies that you may want to bring in the car with kids on a long trip.<br /><br />Summary in one paragraph:<br /><br />It is the story of Po the Panda. The most unlikely hero. He is fat, lazy and uncomfortably clumsy. He loves Kung Fu, in fact he has posters of all his Kung Fu idols on his bedroom walls. Son of a very proud noodle maker who wants to leave his super secret recipe to his son once he become mature enough. One day, there was a news of a public special occasion that the Dragon Warrior will be selected at the Jade Temple. Po has to be there to witness such a historical event. Pretending to his father that he will be selling noodles at the event, he arrived late because he has trouble hauling the heavy noodle cart on the stairs that lead to the temple. The gate were now all closed. The strangest thing happened when master Shifu was about to pick the Dragon warrior. Po, attempting every thing just to catch a glimpse of the event, literally fall on the very spot. Nobody can believe it even Po himself, except Oogway, the old (turtle) master who says that everything that happens in this world is not an accident. The main villain is the Snow Leopard &#34;Tai Lung&#34; who eventually escaped from his prison and threatened the whole village for his revenge. His main reason was not being chosen as the Dragon Warrior and entrusted the ultimate kung fu secret which is supposedly written on the scroll inside the temple. The great battle has to happen between the Dragon Warrior and Tai Lung. The whole village has to be evacuated. At this time, Po has been handed the scroll but he did not know what to make of it. Finally, it was his father that gave him the real answer to the scroll, the answer lies in the secret noddle recipe.the scroll inside the temple.

B0017I1FP8|5.0|Ever since THE ROCK and THE LAST SAMURAI had such an impressive soundtrack to be released! Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard did an incredible job in not only adding to the action on the screen but also capturing the essence of this new Batman.<br /><br />Moving, exciting and ingenious. A true Masterpiece that can stand on its own as a piece of orchestral art. Strong percussions and nervous strings; brief melodies that build even higher tensions and the ever present thin black line of the Batman Theme to tie it all together. It is only deserving that the best movie this summer is accompanied also by the best Soundtrack.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
1416550518|1.0|I fell for all of the positive reviews, but found the book to be utterly predictable, and therefore, a tedious, dull read. I skimmed much of it, determined to get to the end, hoping to be surprised. The finale was close to what I predicted, but even if it had ended differently, I just couldn't muster any feeling for the characters so didn't really care what happened to any of them. This book is not even a good beach read. Don't waste your time.
B000CNFC76|4.0|Disney once again comes up with an entertaining sports movie. This time centering around the 1913 U.S. Open Golf match. The story starts with some of the key characters as children and what they endure to end up at the U.S. Open. Well told true story with great characterizations. Most the family will enjoy it whether they like golf or not. This is just an overview that deals with the politics of the sport as much or more than the game itself. A dim view of the British club members and their looking down their nose at others is shown. Francis Ouimet's caddy adds some humor. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. If you enjoyed this catch \\"The Legend of Bagger Vance\\" and \\"The Natural\\". - C. Luster
B0013FSL3E|2.0|I read the raving reviews and expected a walt disney classic for adults - something like The Sound of Music for the 21st century or Star Wars or something, but with an environmental theme.    I drifted off when they reached the spaceship and awoke when the robots led a revolt.    Definitely not for adults. I should have spent my money on Angelina Jolie instead ...
0553381687|2.0|I don't understand the rave reviews for this book.  I can only imagine they must have been written by entry level fantasy readers.  Game of Thrones contains ideas, characters, plot lines, and props you've seen in other books, not to mention the medieval setting which is old hat.  In addition, there is much flagrant borrowing from Tolkien without the scholarship or depth of imagination.  The multi-thread plot structure doesn't work because there are far too many characters, and you don't care much about any of them.  Daenerys was the only interesting character and I found myself skipping to her chapters.  There are many spots were the writing is excellent and shines but not bright enough to save the novel. I'm glad I borrowed this from the library and didn't pay for it.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I was a little disappointed when I bought the DVD box set, and found that the horse head section was not rearranged with the cut scenes! They have them on the extra disc, but not in the movie. I saw it on cable once, and loved it! It made more sense with the killing of the race horse, not just to strong arm the studio head, but because of the abuse of the child star! I really hope they add this option to the Blurays, like they did with all the versions of the Blade Runner movie!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read a lot of reviews before buying this dvd and yes, this really is a great workout for 20 min. I didn't think that I would need to start at level 1...but that's where I'm going to stay probably for the first week. I just completed doing this for the 2nd time and even though my muscles were stiff from yesterday, I didn't feel sore. So I pushed it even harder today and boy, do I feel great. I used 5 lbs weights which seemed right until I'm ready to advance.  This workout is over before you start giving yourself excuses to stop, 20 min is so perfect and everyone can find that time (after work, before morning coffee, during kids' nap time etc.) if you're committed.  I didn't want to wait for the shipment so I started checking local stores and while both Target and Walmart have it for the same price as Amazon ($10.99), they were both out of stock. BestBuy had it available and they were willing to adjust their price as long as I showed a print out of Target website, very nice.  I love that there are no breaks, and that by the end my thighs are ready to burst and my whole core feels stronger.   If you've been inactive, it'll probably take some time to be able to complete level one at full speed. Thank you Jillian for kicking my butt today!
B0000508UN|4.0|When I look at the vinyl ephemera (much of it courtesy of CTI records) in my collection from the 1970s, this is one of the few albums  that I don't have slotted for the Salvation Army box.  The tunes have the repetitive, caught-in-a-rut modal-rhythmic characteristics of material from this period, yet the solo work along with chord voicings and minimal changes provide much of redeeming value.  The groove is occasionally monotonous but frequently hypnotic and, unlike so much recorded material from the era--even with acoustic instruments and straightahead swinging sounds--the bass isn't overamplified to the point of drowning out, or at least upstaging, the rest of the musical action during the session. \\"Time to Remember\\" is a tune that got to me to the point that I wrote several other melodies based on its chord progression (the truth can finally be told).<br /><br />Although most of the good music of the seventies is \\"countercultural\\"--i.e. reactionary mainstream recordings (by Oscar, Basie, Pass, Zoot) on Pablo or by Bill Evans on Fantasy or Blakey and the Jazz Messengers on just about any European label (no domestic label would record him) or Clifford Jordan's transcendent \\"Glass Bead Games,\\" \\"Grant Green Alive,\\" while certainly no \\"Glass Bead Games,\\" is an album not only reflective of its times but fairly enjoyable listening even today.<br /><br />Still, of all the Green albums I've listened to, there's one standout.  As good as the guitarist is on Mobley's \\"Workout\\" or on his own \\"Idle Moments\\" (that title track!) and \\"Grant Stand\\" (with Yusef Lateef at his plain tenor-talkin' best), the real sleeper among his sides, imo, is \\"I Want to Hold Your Hand.\\"  Not just the music but Van Gelder's capturing of the trio's sound (Larry Young's has got to be the least wearing Hammond B3 on record) adds up to a minor masterpiece, and a neglected one even by Green supporters (it's barely mentioned in the recent bio of Green, and rather disparagingly at that).
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|Many have called this film as being in poor taste.  One reviewer claims to own every Criterion title and states they've slipped in their discretion of re-releasing this film.  In my opinion, that's just not true.  I have over 350 titles myself, and if they have every title, they couldn't possibly agree with Sweet Movie, W.R. or I Am Curious.  Each has the same political views while bordering the line of being \\"pornographic\\".  Sweet Movie, in my opinion, is brilliant and also a huge gross-out-fest!<br /><br />Yes, you're going to be disgusted while watching.  Yes, it'll make you uncomfortable.  It's not a pretty film.  You're SUPPOSED to feel that way!  That's WHY it's a good film.  One reason Passolini was murdered was for the political indiscretions presented in his movies, and this one brought some of his haters to the brink.<br /><br />Free speech is what this country is all about.  You have the right to state if something is bad or good by voicing your opinion.  However, I think some folks just miss the point all together with this film.<br /><br />Watch it and see if you can understand it before you form an opinion based on some of these 1 star reviews.  Just put the kids to bed before you press play...<br /><br />Also - if you think you \\"get it\\" and still say it's badly acted...you don't \\"get it\\".  It's called surrealism!!
0385335482|5.0|I have to say this is one that you HAVE TO Log on and Buy this on Amazon, go ahead, don't wait..... If you like fun, lighhearted reading this is a sure hit...    Rebecca is a shopaholic tried and true, she has things that she buys because they are a great buy, and things that still have the tags on them... This book will have you laughing out loud, even if you are NOT a shopper....    Sophie Kinsella has a quick wit in her writing of this book and the character of Rebecca.  You will not want to put it down and the great thing is you can continue to read the shopaholic series long after this one....
0789318121|2.0|This book is as disappointing as the film was excellent. Primarily an oversized script with a small padding of mainly pre-production art and a light sprinkling of text, neither of which provide much in the way of additional information. The written content feels like a filler article for a weekend entertainment supplement.    Also, I wonder if the scope and focus shifted during the compliation or editing; some retailers are advertising this book as featuring content and interviews that are not included.    It's unfortunate that with the general drift towards CGI, true technical publications like Cinefex have featured less actual behind-the-scenes production detail and more \\"we did this and that, and then just replaced it all in post\\", and we are left with lightweight efforts like this that will probably fail to satisfy those enthusiasts who delight of the production process as least as much as the end result.     Ah well, hopefully there'll be more comprehensive material on the disc release.
0151013837|5.0|I don't know what to add about this book.<br />It is based on a true story,the central character is now a Canadian citizen, one fact I can add to anyone who bothers to read my reveiw.He is alive,living in the midwest,and about 5 years younger than myself.<br />If you love pictorial allegories,and appreciate the wizard of Oz, or Alice through the looking glass,then this is your next book to read.<br />I love Amy Tan, Margaret Atwood,and Arthur c. Clark, and Rawling's Harry Potter series.<br />This is an extroardinary book.It is not like anything I read before,including the abovementioned.<br />I bought my first copy of this book in a Toronto airport in 2003;I began reading it in the plane,I was headed for Madrid,and when I got there,I boarded a bus to take me through town,past juan miro and picasso and other Spanish artists' work on display in public boulevards...<br />It was 7 AM ,when I arrived in Madrid. I looked at the outdoor art on boulevards between reading snatches of the last chapters of this book.<br />I was annoyed to be told by the tour guide to observe  works by Miro(may God forgive me!)and ,the guy called Bigassole.ahem.Picasso. This story kept me awake for 14 hours,and I was not tired in the least.<br />Maybe Barcelona is the only place that could divert my eyes off the pages of this book.<br />Maybe.<br />But it didn't work for me in 2003...I read this book,cover to cover,for about 16 hours.<br />I wanted to find out how this Indian teenager survived the Pacific ocean,with a tiger on board, no food or fresh water.<br />He did.<br />good thing I finished it before hitting Barcelona.<br />One of the best of the best books written.It's Darwin,Jung,Freud,Kahil Gibran,with a touch of Ekhart Tolle.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|Great concert . . very entertaining, a must for Nightwish fans. Tarja is superb.
B00166QJRU|3.0|I think this little box set is a tad pricey for what it actually is.<br />Makes me wish Ronson's dry cleaning bills really were in it!<br />Sounds good though.
B0002RQ2T4|4.0|The film is great, and I really liked the english transfer. This disc has 5.1 in both Dolby and DTS for both Japanese and English. You really feel the action rolling past you when listening. The set has some great extras, too. The case has a clear plastic sleeve, and the inside is a tri-fold with the two discs and special extras. The two sided poster is the image on the cover, and the opposite is the Major floating on a red background. The postcard is also nice. Recommended for the collector, otherwise the single disc will do.
B0009VCSXW|4.0|I loved this movie on the big screen and I love watching it on the bus on the way to work on my PSP. I ordered it through Amazon, not a seller, and as usual, it came exceedingly quickly and in perfect condition.     The movie is just great- lots of slash and gore, but muted and understated. It's a grown up film and if you're a grown up into good directing and the comic genre, it will appeal to you immensely. If you want to know about shopping through Amazon, it's great too- very timely and with little muss and fuss. Enjoy!
B00001SIES|5.0|Muse has done a lot of improving since their Showbiz days yet this CD still remains one of my favorite in my music library. Why? Simple: Because Muse has always been awesome.    Sunburn starts out the album was a dramatic and captivating mixture of piano arpeggios and guitar. I get chills every time I hear Matt sing \\"And I feel...a guilty conscience grow.\\"    Well, while were on the subject of Matt Bellamy, let me say this. This guy deserves so much credit. He plays the guitar/piano on all the tracks, sings, and wrote the music? And he was only 19/20ish at the time? Ridiculous. He refuses to back down from any melody or line, forgetting things such as \\"vocal limitations\\", and belts it out as is. From his falsetto chorus in \\"Unintended\\" to his practical screaming in \\"Uno\\", his quickly emerging (though not quite perfected) talent is impossible to ignore.    Moving on, the album produces other highlights like \\"Muscle Museum\\", with lyrics so refreshingly honest and mind tugging (\\"I don't want you to adore me/Don't want you to ignore me when it pleases you\\"), you may have to listen to this song multiple times before you can grasp it entirely.  \\"Cave\\" holds a similar suit, with easily relatable lyrics for anyone who has ever just wanted to be left alone or take responsibility for their own self. \\"Uno\\" is an almost James Bond-esque type track, bouncing back between slow and hyper, but always mysterious.  Matt almost screams the chorus and lets his guitar do a lot of the work, making this an excellent track.     \\"Uno\\" is not the only track that captures verbal angst; the Album-titled song \\"Showbiz\\" is not only one of best on this CD, but a standout among all Muse songs. It's dark, building mood climaxes into Matt's screams on anguish. Never before had I ever been able to feel someone's pain so vibrantly through music, but Muse captures a haunting feeling of deception and confusion. Amazing song.    On the slower side, \\"Unintended\\" undoubtedly takes the cake. A tender, slow,and unoffensive love song that could very well make you cry. The lyrics are truly beautiful (\\"I'll be there as soon as I can/but I'm busy mending broken/pieces of the life I had before/before you\\")and they manage to capture an uncertainness and hesitation of love (\\"You COULD be my unintended\\") that's very real, but few artists manage to capture.   \\"Falling Down\\", with its blusely riffs definitely deserves a mention. Matt's voice seems to verge on breaking from mixture of high notes, yelling, and more anguish. It pulls together for an unexpected-ly lovely song.    The album concludes with the song \\"Hate This and I'll Love You.\\" Once you hear this song completely though you'll understand why they put it as the finale. Starting out with chirping crickets, progressing into another catchy passionate chorus with stunning yet vague lyrics (\\"Cause I was born to destroy you; and I am growing by the hour), Matt's voice growing so tender and poignant you SWEAR it's going to crack (\\"You led me on...\\") and jamming back to crickets again. I consider it to be one of Muse's most underrated tracks. A true gem    In conclusion, despite what the critics may say, this album is definitely worth a listen for anyone who likes Muse or meaningful music. Muse has gone on to expand and improve but they started out innovative and talented to begin with, and the proof lies clearly here. It's not exactly an easy listen; it's a CD that challenges you and might even make you think.  Multiple songs portray anguish and pain and some border on dark, but it's overall amazing music.
B0017MO10U|4.0|For starters, I could hardly wait for this movie to come out. Overall, I really enjoyed it.  The interaction between characters was great as always and the plot was entertaining.  It was great seeing \\"the gang\\" all back together.  I hadn't realized how much I'd missed new episodes of SG-1 until I saw the first scene. In the end I was only slightly disappointed.  My biggest (and really only) complaint was that I wish it had been longer.  It felt like a long episode, not a \\"movie\\"  I would have preferred it was more like 198 min long instead of only 98 min.  I also wish Jack had featured a bit more prominently in the story instead of Cam.  Don't get me wrong, I like Cam alot (Ben Browder is awesome) but Jack has always been my favorite.   Highly recommended for all fans of SG-1!
0312379293|5.0|I have long ebjoyed Jeffrey Archer and his writings.  You can depend on mystery and intrigue.  This accomplishes this very well.  I found myself unhappy at the time when I had to put the book down.  I believe this to be his very best!
B001AZIRZY|4.0|People who complain that television networks aren't about taking risks need to see this show. It doesn't pander nor sugar coat complex adult political themes and never stoops to the level of mere entertainment. It's as close to video meditation as animation has ever come and for that alone, it deserves everyone's time. Do not confuse this with the Car Talk radio show. This is an entirely different animal. If you go in expecting some version of \\"Family Guy\\" you'll not be happy. Approach it with an open mind, however, and you will be rewarded with unrelenting bliss.
B0019IB26I|5.0|The best of all John Mayer's sides.  One album, 3 different performances, and a whole lot of heart.  Doesn't compare to seeing him live but will fill the void till you can.
0061139378|5.0|I first came across this book on tape in the bargain bin somewhere and I bought it because it looked interesting, and I love dark fantasy. I'm 26 and I knew I'd be too old for it but I love that genre so who cares. I loved this book so much I bought it in print, because having it on tape wasn't enough. It's like Alice in Wonderland meets Tim Burton. Neil Gaiman has a remarkable way of making scary surroundings dark and sinister and yet fantastically safe and inviting. A darling and superb read.
0307346617|5.0|Wow!       After reading the Zombie Survival Guide, I was compelled to pick this book up. And let me tell you...I was riveted! I've read quite a few horror books, but this one had me one edge. The interview format was unique to me, and perfect for the storyline. Max Brooks has simply sold me, I'd read anything he's written now.      On a broader sense though, when you think of how a world-wide pandemic might just play out in real life...I think he's pretty close to reality there with conveying mass hysteria, mob mentality, frantic large-scale responses, and finally the triumph of human adaptivity and spirit. Simply chilling and VERY well done. Read this book...
B000002JKA|3.0|I can't believe that I have ever seen a rant about prog rock, instead of a review for CD before.  Who the heck is this Adem dude anyway?  \\"Rock is supposed to be mindless\\".  Well that is nice to know, now that I have listened to decades of great music with great lyrics by many, many bands that so many other people think are wonderful.<br /><br />By the way, this is an excellent recording.  Don't always pay attention to all of the reviews by the Amazon personnel!
1400049628|5.0|Listen...    I'm not a huge horror fiction fan, but this was very well done...Just like a proper survival manual, FUNNY! And, the short accounts of attacks at the end were chilling and well written. Were zombies medically possible, Max Brooks would have sold me on this completely. Well done.
0385340567|1.0|I really liked Reacher when I started reading Child's books, however his politics have continually bled into his writings, coming to a head in this most recent failure. I think Child lost something in this installment.    I don't buy fiction to be preached at during an election year. I buy fiction to enjoy some escapist moments. There are better thriller authors out there; I think I'll continue reading them, and leave Lee Child's books on the shelf.
1581806574|5.0|I was extrememly pleased with this book. I love to draw, but i'm not that great. It does an excellent job explaining things to you and helping you understand why to draw things the way they show you. I think I was pretty successful at drawing some of the images in the book. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to learn how to draw such amazing creatures.
8185300534|5.0|Any true spiritual seeker cannot afford to pass this book up.  Ironically, it's impossible to convey in words what it contains and why it is so valuable.  It's left to each of us to find the way.  Highly recommended, but bear in mind that it isn't \\"easy.\\"
0307387178|5.0|and for me - Jon Krakauer's is one of those writers that just need to be read. His book Into the Wild is nothing short of splendid. The writing is flawless and the characters are fully developed and likeable.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Just like the movie, probably one of the better soundtracks created in last 2 decades.  Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard created a masterpiece.  Especially Joker's \\"Why so serious\\" track is awesome.  Everytime I hear that, it feels like Heath Ledger's Joker is about to enter my room.  Just like the movie, unbelievable music.
B000VUFJ3C|4.0|Love this album much; the four guys rocks my world (minus Kevin)notice of singing their tunes out, even so forth... they could rock it whenever they wanted to.
B00005JPS8|4.0|I really loved this movie until the big fight at the end.  Robert Downey Jr. is one of the better actors and he was perfect fit for this movie.  This is a clear definition of summer blockbuster.  Great special effects and great acting from all the stars. Only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that I wasn't really impressed with the fight with Ironman and the bad guy.  I was expecting little bit more from the last fight.  Other than that really good movie.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This tape really does give you a good workout. The only downside is that it is pretty annoying that you have to listen to Jillian's intro every time - I wish you could fast forward to the actual workout.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Did I just witnessed the movie history by watching this movie?, easily the best movie made in last two decades.  I can't wait till it comes out on DVD,  I will watch Heath Ledger's Joker over and over again.  I have already seen this movie three times, and still can't enough of it.  The story is excellent, before this movie came out I had very high expectations just like when Spiderman 2 came out.  I thought Spiderman 2 was the best superhero movie made until The Dark Knight came out.  All of my expectations were fulfilled and some.  All the acting was top notch.  Christian Bale was good as Bruce Wayne and Batman, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Maggie Gyllanhall gave excellent performances.  But one characters steals the show which I have never seen it happen like this in any movie is Heath Ledger's portrayal of Joker.  The music that was composed for him is daunting.  Everytime he is not on the screen, you are wondering what is he going to do next.  Every scene he is in is perfectly shot and delivered.  Its too bad Heath is not alive to see his success.  And anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you are missing a movie history.
B000003CMB|5.0|Wow, I have the task to try to convince you of the greatness of The Allman Brothers at Fillmore East.  Many folks have already given great reviews of this album, so I'll try to give my take on this one.      First, some background.  This album includes selections from two nights worth of performances at the \\"Fillmore East\\" music club in 1971 with the band's original lineup, including the incomparable Duane Allman on lead/slide guitar (he would die in a motorcycle accident later in the year).  The band had recorded and produced two studio albums in their previous couple of years together, and this was their first live album.  There is another version available of this album that has additional recordings from these concerts (simply called \\"At Fillmore East\\" by Amazon), but I personally don't have that album, so I'll let others discuss the virtues of it.    Now, onto the music.  At face value, this album mixes a couple of their previous hits (\\"Whipping Post\\" and \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\"), some blues classics (\\"Statesboro Blues\\", \\"Done Somebody Wrong\\", \\"Stormy Monday\\", and \\"You Don't Love Me\\"), along with an original instrumental (\\"Hot 'Lanta\\").  The band mixes their own style of blues, Southern rock and even a bit of jazz, throws in the slide guitar and adds harmonica on one track, and uses their own improvisational skills to turn out a memorable performance that all of us who weren't in attendance (or in my case, not even born yet) are now fortunate enough to experience through the joy of this album.    I won't describe all of the tracks in great detail, but I'll cover my personal favorites.  The album starts off with a jolt with an infectious and upbeat \\"Statesboro Blues\\", where Gregg Allman shines with his strong vocals.  The album mellows out with the third track, \\"Stormy Monday\\".  This song is even-keeled throughout, with an extended guitar solo backed up by solid bass, organ, and percussion, giving us a taste of what's to come.  \\"You Don't Love Me\\" followsthat with another catchy number for almost 7 minutes (with the aforementioned harmonica), when Duane starts taking over the song.  Before too long, the other band members join in the fun.  While this isn't my favorite track, it is fun to listen to the musicians go to work.  For my money, the album climaxes with the sixth track, \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\".  The song may be a touch over 13 minutes long, but it never seems to be that long when I listen to it as it never feels dull.  The band takes a previously-recorded instrumental of theirs and nearly doubles the length with searing guitar sections (with some nice organ stretches thrown in), building to a crescendo around the 10 1/2 minute mark and again at the 12 minute mark.  In general, I'm a big fan of rock instrumentals, and this may be my very favorite.  The finale of the album is simply the longest song I (currently) have in my music collection.  At just over 23 minutes, \\"Whipping Post\\" takes a trip starting with the familiar opening of the studio version of this song (in an unusual 11/8 meter for parts), goes through some nice guitar stretches, then nearly grinds to a halt after 10 minutes.  It then goes through some \\"less organized\\" stretches where the musicians are able to add their own flavor to the song.  It peaks near the 17 minute mark, where the conclusion of the studio version is inserted in this live version.  From there the song slowly peters out.  For me, this song does kind of drag in sections, as I feel about the middle stretch of \\"You Don't Love Me\\".      When you put it all together, you have one of the strongest live albums  available, especially if you favor the blues/Southern rock style of The Allman Brothers Band.  You get a good listen to the greatness and originality of the individual band members, especially Duane Allman.  And yet, the sounds come together to form some fantastic music.  You may argue whether you prefer some of the more improvisational stretches in the songs, but it's hard to argue the quality of the individual and collective performances that this band put together in those fateful concerts in 1971.
B000003TB6|5.0|add this to your collection if you don't already have it. i love every track on it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This is a wonderful CD containing a variety of traditional Irish, classical and contemporary music. The majority contains vocals by some of the most talented soloists Ireland has to offer, but some of the tracks are fantastic instrumental numbers by the groups violinist, Mairead Nesbitt. She will delight you with her traditional sound and her mastery of the instrument.
B0017MO10U|3.0|I enjoyed this movie just like I would have enjoyed ANY ONE-HOUR EPISODE of Stargate SG1.  The plot was nothing spectacular.  It could have been just another episode.  A good episode, but nothing more.  It was better than the first SG-1 Series Movie - Stargate Ark of Truth.  Just about anything would have been better than that first movie.      And where was the romance with Jack and Samantha?  We've all waited light years for something long-term to FINALLY happen between these two before one of the actors dies in real life.    Will we have to wait until the actors are in their 80's or 90's to see a real relationship bloom with these star-crossed and formerly military-restricted sweethearts where they can get it on for the long term?      The possibilities for comedy and creativity are endless if the creators of these series/movies take this next giant step.     If you make another movie please let Carter have a life with her beloved Jack.  It is just getting to be so one-dimensional.  The possibility of adding the depth of a real relationship between these two would really add to the dimension of this series.      Please don't let SG-1 go down in history like the real people in Washington, DC.  They have no lives.  I just moved away from there.  I spent the last 52 years of my life there.  I was born there and was enmeshed in the politics and workaholism of the Washington, DC mindset.      When I wanted to stop being a workaholic I searched for a Workaholics Anonymous in the DC area and NO ONE HAS STARTED ONE.  GO FIGURE!!!!!    Please let the SG-1 Characters have more of a life than their real governmental counterparts in the Washington, DC based government and military.  It's about time!!!!  There is more to life than power and prestige.  Jack and Samantha need to get it on.        It was great to see Teal'C and Daniel and the other regulars.  I marvel at Christopher Judge's physique each time he is on screen.  He is a wonderful actor also.  Best wishes from me to all of the actors, crew, writers, etc.    I do have a technical observation of the first half of the movie.  It was shot too dark.  It was far too difficult to see what was going on for most of what was happening at first in the Antarctic.  If a new printing is made of this movie you might want to lighten it up a bit.    It was with sadness that I read of the recent passing of Don S. Davis.  I hope he is smiling down from up above as so many of us enjoy seeing him once more in this movie.  May God Bless him and his family as they mourn his passing.    Thank you to Richard Dean Anderson and the rest of the team.  My family and I have Seasons 1-10 and we enjoy watching them over and over again.  The SG-1 Series has so much depth and creativity packed into each episode that I am sure it is hard to top the episodes with a movie.  But I hope you take my advice and add that missing component - Jack and Samantha together - and we want to watch :)
0743298039|5.0|I LOVED this book! Had a bit of a slow start, but after a couple of chapters I even took the book to the amusement park while kids went on rides, it was THAT difficult to put down.     The story is well-developed, the characters compelling.     The only sad part: it's Ms. Setterfield's debut so no others of hers to read... yet!    Highly recommended!!
0385006896|3.0|As a fan of Sherlock Holmes, I really liked reading the four novels and fifty-six short stories contained in this book. However, the type is smaller than I would have liked so if you have poor vision I would advise you purchase the novels separately. Also, after reading through the book a second time, the binding started to warp and a few pages came out. Therefore, if you plan to give this book a lot of use, it might not last.
1569242739|5.0|Awesome book! Answers all your beginner baking questions and adds a little humor to the mix, which gives the book a funny twist. Makes it fun and exciting to try new creations! Allows the inner artist in you to come out! Love these girls! Feel like I've known them forever!
B000JJ4PDK|4.0|this was another album that i bought when it first came out and gave it to my brother, didn't like anything about it. when it was re-released i picked it up and haven't put it down since then. no skipping tracks on this one either.
B0007M22TI|5.0|Mairead Nesbitt has been featured in Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, Dance Invasion, and other fabulous Irish shows.  But this DVD contains some of her best work.  You will be absolutely enchanted as she prances around the stage like a pixie all while fiddling and never missing a note.  She is accompanied by some very talented soloists with angelic voices.  This DVD offers something for everyone.
B000H305U0|5.0|One of the best albums.  In my opinion every song was a HIT!  JT out shined himself with this one!
B000Q66PXE|5.0|It's too bad that Rome couldn't have made it at least one more season, but the production cost was way to high, even for HBO. After The Sopranos (seasons 1-3 especially), Rome and Deadwood are tied for my second favorite series from this network. The characters are all interesting and well acted, the action scenes are brutally realistic, the production design is epic and the storylines are captivating. What's not to love? I do think that the first season is better than the second, but that's not saying it's not worth five stars as well. If you liked the film Gladiator or just history in general, you will learn much more about Rome and the many colorful characters who live in it. Now if only HBO would stop getting rid of classic shows like Rome, Deadwood and Carnivale after two or three seasons.
1582701709|1.0|after all the hot buzz about The Secret I became curious and started reading it. The first few pages made sense to persuade ourselves into positive thinking. But then it just gets repetitive, the author repeats one simple concept over and over again. It becomes dull and obvious on making basic philosophies into an-all-scientific-speech. Couldn't continue reading anymore after 1/3 of the book. Not worth the time.
B0013FNC38|4.0|Not really sure why I bought this album in particular.  I already had the new Coldplay CD in my cart and wanted to add another CD just to try something new and also to qualify for the free shipping.  I was expecting to love the coldplay CD and wasn't expecting much out of Jason Mraz.  It turned out to be the exact opposite!    With that said, I must say I am happily surprised by Jason Mraz's album.  This isn't really my \\"type of music\\" to begin with, but Jason Mraz really offers something musically satisfying.  I haven't heard anything that sounds like this prior to listening to this album.    Good job Jason!
B0001AP12G|4.0|i listened to this everyday when it first came out. it's a fun cd to listen to. his lyrics are crazy, but his beats are on point.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This is a fantastic concert featuring some of the most beautiful voices Ireland has to offer and also the incredibly talented fiddler - Mairead Nesbitt.  She will amaze and delight you as she twirls and leaps around the stage with her violin.  There is no one else quite like Mairead Nesbitt!
1577311523|1.0|I have been a student of the Tao for several years and have a general understanding of Eastern thought, but it seems that Mr. Tolle just skipped any actual study and went straight for the book.  Let me put it this way, anybody who says they have achieved enlightenment has not, and anybody who is enlightened would not publish a self help book.
074325144X|3.0|The process is too involved and requires too much work to master. I run a couple of miles 3-4 days a week, so it is just not worth the effort. I give it 3 stars because the program could be useful to serious distance runners.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I'm 61 years of age.  As a child I watched the very birth of Television.  I've seen all the classic TV Series'.  The Series of The West Wing created and largely written by Aaron Sorkin is the best of them all.  My family has dubbed me as a hopeless Churchillian.  Indeed I am!!  I am also a hopeless West Wing addict.  A fine Vodka or fine Scotch along with an episode of the West Wing and I'm in Heaven.  I can recite the lines before they are spoken.  If I could rate 6 Stars I would!!<br /> The writing throughout is excellent.  Even when Sorkin leaves, the quality is maintained.  The acting is beyond reproach.  Each casting member is ideal to their respective scenarios.  In all, we will learn how our government operates.  Even if you are a Republican you can identify with your Party and be proud.  This is indeed a slant of a Liberal President, however it is written to see both sides of the political spectrum.<br />  The Series lasted for 154 episodes and Seven Seasons.  The major players are really too long to list.  My favorites are Alan Alda, Dule Hill, Allison Janney, Robert Lowe, Janel Maloney, Richard Schiff, John Spencer, Bradley Whitford, Jimmy Smits and of course Martin Sheen.<br /> My all-time top ten favorite episodes in order of the very best are:<br /> 1. In Excelsis Deo<br /> 2. Two Cathedrals<br /> 3. Holy Night<br /> 4. 20 Hours in America<br /> 5. The Two Bartlets<br /> 6. Mr. Willis of Ohio<br /> 7. Lord John Marbury<br /> 8. The Long Goodbye<br /> 9. Twenty Five<br /> 10. The Supremes<br /> In all we find drama, comedy and educational thought into the very essence of American political behavior.  Please do purchase this complete Series, you will not be disappointed.
B0000013G9|4.0|another album that should be in everyone's collection. i never thought they had the best voices, but it all just flows together nicely. their lyrics are sometimes deep and sometimes fun and the beats bring alot to the table as well.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|This is a wonderful CD containing a variety of traditional Irish, classical and contemporary music. The majority contains vocals by some of the most talented soloists Ireland has to offer, but some of the tracks are fantastic instrumental numbers by the groups violinist, Mairead Nesbitt. She will delight you with her traditional sound and her mastery of the instrument.
B000ZN802W|5.0|There's not much to criticize in this film, it's almost flawless, a seamless piece of art. It's the composite of the True story of Christopher McCandles, The Jon Krakauer novel, the screen play directed by Sean Penn and the sound track By Eddie Vedder. I've never heard a better cohesiveness between a soundtrack and a screenplay than in this movie, it's haunting. Sean Penn uses a chapter format sequence for the movie in the sense of the Krakauer novel and the literary prowess and potential of McCandles himself who may quite possibly have become a great writer had he not encountered the profound and inadvertent course of advents that culminated in his fate. The performances by all the actors were great and the Eddie Vedder songs are powerful. A must see film for anyone who loves dramas about \\"push the envelope\\" type personalities.
0375836675|5.0|Before he stopped the bank robbery, Ed's life wasn't that interesting. It was a boring routine of work as a cabdriver, card games, taking care of his ancient dog, and pining after his best friend Audrey. But all that changes suddenly. Because that's when the first card arrives in the mail, and on it are carefully written three addresses. Thus begins Ed's journey, delivering messages he knows nothing about until he is given a place or a person. He offers comfort, strength, encouragement, and even threats, and as he does so, uncovers many truths about his friends, family, and even himself.     I am the Messenger snags your attention from the very first line with its sardonic and wry wit and complete and utter honesty. Ed is an amusing, frustrating, and engaging narrator, and even his self deprecation is entertaining as he regales the reader with his many tasks, set forth by a mysterious, unidentified person. Zusak does a splendid job at turning this seemingly average guy into someone that the reader can relate, but is at the same time perfectly unique and colorful.  Funny, painful, poignant, and thought provoking, I am the Messenger is full of thoughtful musings, practical ponderings, and expertly explores human life and interaction in such a way that makes this novel a complete winner.
B0017APQ1K|5.0|this film looks incredible on blu-ray. If you love the movie and only have it on DVD buy it in blu-ray and you'll see a new movie. Plus you get $10 back from Sony if you send it the DVD UPC and your blu-ray sales receipt!
B0015519VS|3.0|i had to edit my review to say that i really like this one. favorite song is \\"someting special\\". i must admit like some of the other reviewers, this wasn't his best and it's a different sound but it just shows he's maturing with his sound and style.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This is a wonderful CD containing a variety of traditional Irish, classical and contemporary music. The majority contains vocals by some of the most talented soloists Ireland has to offer, but some of the tracks are fantastic instrumental numbers by the groups violinist, Mairead Nesbitt. She will delight you with her traditional sound and her mastery of the instrument.
B00006AW2S|5.0|It may not be as good as 12 X 5, but it's a good sampling of very Early Stones with Brian Jones.  Take a listen to The Spider and the Fly.  It's fun, a nice surprise, and my favorite cut on the ablum. The ablum is a little raw, but that's the way they were back then, in 1964 and 1965 and that's why they were one of my favorite groups. The Bad Boys of Rock N Roll.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I do tae bo all the time and this workout is just as hard if not harder!  Thank you Jillian.  If you enjoy being pushed to the limit, these three workouts will do that for you.  You can be ripped in a short period of time.  It's perfect for the quick bikini shape-up.
B000F3AAUW|2.0|i bought this based on the reviews, thinking that i was going to like it. maybe i need to give it a good listen, but i've tried twice and i just can't get into it.
1416914293|5.0|When I first picked up City of Bones, I wasn't sure what to make of it. As I was reading, I fell in love. No, it's definitely not heavy reading, and yes, there is better quality prose, but the book was just so fun and made me laugh out loud (which is rare), and the writing, while not amazingly spectacular, works perfectly for the story and is far from bad.    City of Ashes was even better. The characters are the kind of people you wish you knew, but don't; yet they're also just the kids next door. They bridge the gap between the ordinary and extraordinary, and you love them all for their weaknesses and strengths.    If you love fantasy, if you love sarcastic, witty conversations, if you love star-crossed lovers...READ THIS BOOK!
B00006AW2O|5.0|Some of the younger Stones fans may not be aware that the Rolling Stones started out as a blues band.  This album is very early Stones (1964), and in my opinion, in addition to Let It Bleed, it is one of the best albums they have ever done. Some songs rock, some are bluesy (?), and some are familiar, but all are great.  I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is interested in the Rollings Stones roots or who just loves to listen to something different.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I bought Rockferry by Duffy as a gift for my sister who'd seen her perform on Ellen.  She loves the CD so much that I haven't seen it back in the house since she opened the package!
B0000039QA|4.0|another one of my favorite's in my cd collection. no skipping tracks on this one.
1416955070|5.0|City of Bones is the sort of book you pick up with only a vague sense of what to expect, and put down only after devouring every page, reading and re-reading your favourite paragraphs. I read and re-read this book, never growing tired of the smart, real characters and amazing world.    This is not a book you will put down exhausted; you will slam the cover shut feeling like you've just drank about five espressos and tap your foot impatiently until you can get your hands on book 2 in the trilogy.     Like with any book, some people don't like City of Bones. But it's a fun book, and one you definitely want to at least give a try.
B000GG4KTU|2.0|Like others, I thought that this CD was a big come-down from her earlier work, specifically, the live in Paris recordings.  However, without putting too fine a point on it, my impression when listening to it a second time (of a total of two), was that my lack of enthusiasm might have been driven more by the selections, with the exception of the title song, or the instrumenation / recording (had to concentrate to hear her piano work) than from Diana, herself.    She's a great! talent, get her Live in Paris DVD to be wowed!
B001CD6FKS|5.0|I was very impressed with the film. It exceeded my expectations. It had a good story and good acting, and the racing scenes were spectacular. The most impressive thing is that they really got the racing right. It is the best racing movie I have ever seen. Most racing movies are ridiculously stupid on track. It works for a comedy like Talladega Nights, but for a serious movie, it needs to look real, and Speed Racer got it right within the context of the futuristic technology. THe motivation for driving was right too. It is a great racing movie.
B000RG1FMO|3.0|i had to listen to this a few times, but i like most of the tracks on it.
0452282152|5.0|I loved it.  The way the writer portrayed each character was so vivid that you can almost see what they look like and the way they talk.  It is a great book.
B0018QCXGY|5.0|Wow what a amazing movie. J.J. Abrhams does a awesome job with this movie, as does the realitively unknow cast. This movie starts off a little slow developing characters in the begining then all of a sudden BOOM and it never stops until the end. This movie was a thrill to watch, even though the handi cam gave me a headache about halfway through, I still enjoyed this movie. The blu-ray version has superior picture quality and audio to die for, that will make you really feel the monster.
0756404746|5.0|I am not going to write a lengthy review telling you about the plot.  Others have already done that.<br /><br />I love this book. The book (and the feelings it generated) stayed with me for days.  I tried to start another book the next day, but could not get my head into it.  Patrick Rothfuss is a wonderful writer and storyteller.<br /><br />The only thing I wish I had known before I purchased it was that it was the first of a series (I wasn't paying attention when I purchased it).  I didn't realize that, to a degree, I would be left hanging.  I have already pre-ordered Day 2 in the series and am anxious for it to come out.
B00005AQF7|4.0|i remember i bought this when it first came out and gave it to my brother. i didnt' like it. then a few years ago, i picked it up when it was on sale. listened to it and didn't realize how good it was. this is another classic hip-hop album.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I liked the book and saw the movie at the library one day and decided to check it out. I'm SOOOO glad that I didn't pay money to see this mess!! I know that the book wasn't meant to be taken as literal history, but this movie is even worse!! It takes liberties that the book didn't even attempt (like suggesting that Henry actually raped Anne, and that Anne and her brother George were actually contmplating an affair just so that Anne could get pregnant. The book never even went that far!!).  Add to that the fact that they chopped soo much out of the book and made a mess of what was left (like not explaining that Mary's husband William got sick and died before she runs off and marries someone else who they only show once, without even explaining who he is or anything about him). I know that it had to be hard trying to fit over 600 pages of story into a 2 hr movie, but this was just awful. For a much better interpretation I would recommend Anne of a Thousand Days, it's a MUCH better movie, and a much more accurate depiction. Watch that one instead.[[ASIN:B000RF7XYY Anne of the Thousand Days / Mary, Queen of Scots]]
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a review for the Blu-ray version. As it was stated by many reviews already, you know this is a darker more brooding Batman than any of the previous films. Christian Bale is perfectly cast as the Dark Knight and is easily the best Batman there has been. Liam Neeson (Ducard) is excellent as the sensei/villian, and Katie Holmes (Rachel Dawes) brings her \\"girl next door\\" charm as the love interest. Cillian Murphy is frightfully creepy as the Scarecrow/Dr Johnathan Crane. The Blu-ray version of this movie is definatly the way to go. Unsurpassed picture quality and superb audio make this the definative version to own, it makes a great movie even better.
B00008DDSC|4.0|I found the movie to be very thought provoking in ref to human nature and how different people like different things in a relationship and sexually. And what brought them to that place. I think it is up for discussion with your partner. I liked it!
B0016NF06O|5.0|What a blessing to have two extraordinary muscians with such diverse musical and cultural backgrounds come together and perform with such mastery and delight.Maybe Willie is the  \\"white sheep\\" of the Marsalis family.
B0012Q732O|3.0|I know this movie didn't get good reviews, but I enjoyed it.  Just remember this is fiction, don't get wrapped up on a reality trip.  It isn't one of the great movies, but it was fun to watch.  I would recommend it to someone that just wants to be entertained.
B0014DFCMS|5.0|Ellen Page does a stand up stand out job as Juno. Man I love this type of humour it kind of reminds me of Ellen Muth in the Dead Like Me series. Its not fall out of your seat slapstick comedy, its way more tounge in cheek but I tend to like that style of comedy. Its is well written and the dialouge is fantastic. Great movie, great cast, watch this movie.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|Batman succeeds as well as it does because, unlike most films, it doesn't look phony by trying to be real.  Instead, it broadcasts its own artificiality: \\"Look at us -- we're doing art!\\"  And extremely well.<br /><br />Part of what gives Batman its self-awareness is an aspect of the film that I haven't seen remarked on: the range of spoofs of popular and sometimes important art that are sprinkled through it.<br /><br />-- It starts by spoofing itself: the Joker reprises Carl Grissom's \\"You're my best man!\\" scene.<br /><br />-- The Joker spoofs the melting witch of The Wizard of Oz.<br /><br />-- The two-bladed thug spoofs the swordsman of Raiders of the Lost Ark, except that where Indiana Jones gives up and shoots him, Batman plows straight through him with his fists.<br /><br />-- The Joker's lieutenant then spoofs Crocodile Dundee with his big hunting knife, except that what was so imposing in Crocodile Dundee (\\"This is a knife!\\") is laughably inadequate for confronting Batman.<br /><br />-- The Batplane spoofs E.T. in crossing the moon, and then spoofs Star Wars in its strafing run through the canyon of the skyscrapers.<br /><br />-- The Joker spoofs Dirty Harry's long-barreled pistol.<br /><br />-- The whole tower scene is a prolonged spoof of Notre Dame de Paris (\\"The Hunchback of Notre Dame\\").<br /><br />I'm sure I've forgotten other films Batman spoofs, and missed more.  Batman never lets you forget that you're watching a movie about a comic book.<br /><br />P.S.  Kim Basinger is brilliant in an under-rated performance that realistically swings her urban working girl between conceited yuppie, terrified hostage, and insecure single: \\"You weigh a little more than 108!\\" -- \\"Oh, really!!\\"
B00008EY65|4.0|\\"There lived a certain man in Russia long ago<br />He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow\\"<br />(\\"Rasputin\\" by Boney M)<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. German military says \\"Ra Ra Rasputin\\" , and tries to open a portal to another dimension<br />2. US Army shows up and all Hellboy breaks loose<br />3. Forget music - it's a Baby Ruth that soothes a savage beast<br />4. Fast forward 60 years and Hellboy and his friends are attached to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense<br />5.

B0017MO10U|5.0|Wow!  This movie has a great plot, amazing effects, big action sequences, and dozens of familiar guest-star faces.  I would have liked a few extra minutes of focus on the main characters' emotional moments, but otherwise it's just about perfect.  Think \\"tv movie\\" for realistic expectations.  But it's just as if we never left the show.  Makes me feel like I'll get to sit down next Friday night and see another.  Great job, Stargate team!  Looking forward to more!
0307346617|4.0|Personally im a very picky book buyer. My thoughts are if i get the book what if it sucks. This book is easily one of my top books to suggest to others. I was hooked from the beginning to the end. Some times i would look up at the clock and realize I had been reading for an hour. Zombie lover or if you just want a good book to read when your bored this is it.
0060899220|5.0|When I picked this book out all I knew about Anthony Bordain is what I saw on No Reservations.  He seemed like a cool guy and lived his life exactly like I want to live mine.  When I was reading this, I felt like it connected even more than I had anticipated.  I've worked in the service industry for a long time and know exactly the type of people he described.  Anyone in the industry, whether it be front of house or kitchen will be able to relate to and enjoy this book on some level.  For people that have never set foot in a restaurant as an employee will still enjoy the stories he tells and his rise from dishwasher to executive chef of a New York restaurant.  Those outsiders will learn things they've never wanted to know about their dining experiences.  All in all it's one of the best books I've ever read.  Obviously, not just cooks will like this book considering it made the best seller list.  Tony is the man and in no way do I feel he sold out, he does what he likes to do and learned from his past mistakes.  Every person should read this book before the next time they go out to eat.
0783226888|5.0|I think this is a really great movie.  I like it because it was nice to see Bruce Willis play a \\"bad\\" guy for a change instead of the down on his luck alcoholic loser (think Die Hard - which I also love).  Besides, in one of his \\"disguises\\" he has a mustache and a decent hair cut which I think makes him look really really good.  Richard Gere has a believable accent and is decent.  Sidney Poitier is not used as much as he could/should be but he has a strong performance as well.  I think the action, plot and timing of the movie are well done.  The only part that I don't like is when Bruce kisses another man.  That was kind of icky to me.  Overall though, I think it's a really good movie and really like the chemistry between Bruce and Richard.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|My wife and I first saw this Blu-ray movie at a/v specialty store months ago.  We were actually distracted by the movie because it was so good.  I am not a \\"discovery\\" channel kind of person but this one is really interesting.  Highly recommend this for any high def viewers.
B000089RVX|5.0|It's interesting that many of the criticism of this album come down to \\"This band isn't REAL metal\\" ...for REAL metal search out Pantera/Slayer/Cradle of Filth (insert name of band with screaming male lead). Okay, if what you like is bands with a screaming male lead, you *probably* won't like Evanescence, I'll give you that.  Other criticisms? \\"They aren't  *real* goth, for *real* goth check out Nightwish, Lacuna Coil, Within Temptation, etc.\\" like it's a competition to be *more gothic* or something  (and FYI I love Within Temptation and Lacuna Coil, Nightwish is okay, I like a few songs).  Other criticisms include \\"Evanescence sucks live\\" when I doubt anyone who hates the band obviously this much would shell out  $70 to see them live (I've seen them live, and they were amazing).  Anyways, Amy Lee is extremely talented (check out youtube videos of her singing a duet in high school if you think her voice is machine generated, or \\"Listen to the Rain\\" a song she wrote for her high school choir if you don't believe she can write songs).  She has *that* voice  - the one that gives you chills and makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.  The only person that comes to mind easily whose also had *that voice* was Karen Carpenter (although gotta say no one in popular music can ever equal the late KC). I will accept this: a lot of their songs sound the same.  Yeah, and maybe the lyrics aren't super-deep, but c'mon they're songs.   95% of popular songs say things like \\"baby, I love you, oh baby\\"   (I have heard a few songwriters who do have deep or clever lyrics, such as Dar Williams or Amanda Palmer of The Dresden Dolls, but those songwriters are VERY few and far between).  Plus, some of the material on this album - such as  she wrote when she probably only about 18 years old or so - pretty talented for an 18 year old!! Personally, this is one of my all-time favorite CDs. I bought this when it first came out, and I still listen to it very often.  Basically, it can bedescribed in one word: beautiful.
0307265730|5.0|Unaccustomed Earth is a beautiful follow up to Interpreter of Maladies, which I had read and loved. Here, Jhumpa Lahiri returns to similar subject matter, the everyday lives of Bengali immigrants. Her characters remain, as ever, complex, well wrought creations that you feel you know intimately. I loved every story in this collection especially the long one at the end, which is more like a short novel. Lahiri's beautiful writing, her great story-telling ability, and deep sense of human sympathy make her works a pleasure to read. I could easily return to Unaccustomed Earth and read it again and probably with as much enjoyment as I did the first time.
0596527055|5.0|A very infomative and entertaining read. The book opens your eyes to a lot of things you usually take foregranted.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|For all of its awkwardness and simplistic beauty, this soundtrack captures the feeling of the plot and movie almost better than the stage musical.  By now it is well known that ABBA founders, Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus, have tailored their numberous hits into a somewhat forced, but workable stage production that has been a world-wide modern classic.  It was only a matter of time before this film was made and its done remarkably well; mixing acting, music and scenery nearly seamlessly.  The instrumentals are toned down from the synthesized originals, but the musical excitement is still there.  Cast members vary in degree of  muscial accomplishment, but its no surprise that Streep can not only carry a tune well, but can inflect a kind of lyrical dialogue effectively without it sounding corny.  Film daughter Amanda Seyfried also sings remarklably well, making the two leads a perfect match.  The other cast members hit and miss with their vocals (Pierce Brosnan being nearly unlistenable), but the mood is caught and held.  For its sheer simplicity, the cast makes this collection work and it is somewhat odd to realize that there are not very many musicals out there in this genre, making \\"Mama Mia\\" even more interesting.  There is no apologing or embarrasment here, only well crafted pop-tunes that please in spite of themselves.  It's a guilty pleasure.
B00007L4MJ|4.0|So ahead of it's time and not comparable to anything before or since. Did a lot to show people the power of cinema in it's infancy, and to me it still looks incredible some 90+ years later.<br /><br />The imagination and vision of Lang's skyscraper landscapes and draconion underbelly of poverty as it's hidden foundation speaks just as loudly to today's world as it ever did.
0812550706|5.0|...you won't regret this read. One of my top three favorites of all time.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|\\"Once\\" is a terrific first film from John Carney, which stars his old bandmate Glen Hansard as well as the talented Mark&eacute;ta Irglov&aacute;.  It is filmed in and around Dublin, including the lovely beach at Howth; and it is enjoyable throughout.<br /><br />Glen and Mark&eacute;ta won an Academy Award for their song \\"Falling Slowly,\\" and almost half of the film consists of songs written by Glen.  The two are fine actors too; and John is to be commended for putting together a first-rate film on a budget of $100,000, if that is to be believed.  If so, Hollywood could learn a lesson or two from him.<br /><br />It is definitely worth watching or buying, and it's delightful.
0345404475|3.0|Not the best stuff but not the worst. World would be less without it though.
0345451325|3.0|[[ASIN:0671655604 Cobra]] was the first of a series about medically \\"improved\\" warriors.  In this book the plot also involves wars in space that remind one of [[ASIN:B0016QX8LU Invaders from the Infinite]] which is one of the oldest space operas from the 30's. Earth is behind in a war with an Alien confederation/ society and must come up with new weapons fast or have all their planets \\"glassed\\". This book is obviously a serial type of<br />wars in space with a hero who is \\"designed\\" to be a deadly killer.<br />[[ASIN:B00152R4VK Dark Angel - The Complete Series]] is about a girl much like John 117 in this novel, but done better? Eric Nylund has done pretty good on a writing \\"contract\\" here, but it could have been better.
B000002KKK|5.0|Haveing a big party and want to blast some tunes but can't decide what cd to put on...this is that cd.
0812550757|5.0|...but an excellent follow up. Worth reading and some excellent concepts explored. Highly recommend it.
B000040OBS|1.0|I have recently heard \\"Girl\\" on Sirius radio and I really like it and I was so shocked to see it was Suicide !! I saw them open for The Cars in the early 80's and I have never seen food thrown at a band before that night and not since. I also have never heard a band booed off the stage either, until that night. The show and music was horrible !!   I will say, almost 30 years later, my tastes have changed and I have warmed to Suicide, this album has a few songs that grow on you but I stick to what I said earlier, HORRIBLE !!
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|Awesome album all round, so glad they are back the world will always need ZZ TOP, HAVE MERCY!
B00003CXA6|5.0|Unique and yet lock step with the book it was based on. Both simply fabulous.
B000002L7R|5.0|Around The World in A Day & Lovesexy, that's if you like real music played by real musicians. All the other good things that I could say have already been said. Peace & Love
B000002KYR|5.0|This is argueably ZZ Top's best effort, and one of the greatest rock albums ever released. Every song is solid right threw till the end!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This movie is both beautiful & hilarious. There are many weird scenes in it that make you want to watch it again, & maybe even a third time. George Clooney is superb in his role of jailbird & faulty husband. The music is so well done that I bought the soundtrack, which I very seldom do.  This movie is part of my movie collection & I am picky about what I purchase. It has to be good, & this one is.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Ark of Truth was about what I expected.  The special effects were good, the story picked up where the SG-1 series left off.  The only thing that I thought was missing was more depth.  Perhaps if it had been longer and more developed I would have felt more satisfied.  Overall, pretty good, though, for us \\"Gate\\" fans.
B000R7HY0K|2.0|Death Proof went on and on with boring elements of Tarrontino's yapping.  At least the end of the film was exciting, but that wasn't enough for me to give it more stars.
B001CD6FKI|5.0|Imagine a screen adaptation that's even better than the beloved original, a summer blockbuster with heart as well as heroics, a family movie the entire family really does love - and maybe you'll have some idea of what a rare find Speed Racer is.    The Wachowskis' love and respect for the source material is evident, even as they expertly tailor the story for the big screen. Their reimagining works especially well in the addition of Rex Racer, Speed's lost brother, as an important onscreen as well as offscreen character. Some longtime fans may quibble with the Brothers' slight tweaks to the Racer X storyline, but like the other relatively minor changes, it actually works better than the original in this context.    Meanwhile, the much-vaunted effects really are all that. The trailers did this movie no favors by making the visuals look somehow cheap and cheesy, but seeing the finished product reveals them as both visionary and thoroughly appropriate for this film, which is an anime come to life on every level.    The performances are uniformly good, but I must single out Emile Hirsch as the title character. It must have been a challenge to play an emotionally mercurial young man such as Speed (cartoon and film) without developing a bad case of Anakin Skywalker syndrome, yet Hirsch does it unselfconsciously and without a trace of off-putting whinyness or self-absorption.    Somehow this movie got lost at the summer box office, and it remains the most underrated film of the year to date. As much as it was made for the big screen - and preferably IMAX, in which it looked glorious - the story is strong enough to carry it to a home setting.    Here's the funny part: I know this movie had flaws. If I sat here thinking long enough, I probably could name some of them. Yet as I was watching, not one of them mattered. In fact, it has been years since I've enjoyed a movie so much. Don't fight this film, just roll with it, and you may find yourself as exhilarated by it as I was.
0446402389|4.0|This is one of those books one stays up all night reading.I truly had trouble putting it down.    Most of the reviewers seem to mention the serial killer chikatilo as the main plot line and character and perhaps he is but the the scariest and most important part of the book for me is the description of life in the Stalininst Soviet Union and the people that carry out this policy such as the anti hero Leo?    Reading about the State as a god that can do no wrong with humanity as the enemy made my skin crawl.Beware of what you say,think and do for it just may represent a flaw that could not exist in the perfect utopia.  Does this remind anyone of the dangers of our current Political Correctness?Well it does me.This book is a warning.It seems to me Chickatilo was as much an agent of the State as anyone in uniform.    Unfortunately,I found the ending very trite and unsatisfying and certainly unworthy of this superior   story.

B000WGWQG8|1.0|A harmless DVD but a complete anticlimax of a film. Best watched with a US format box, doesn't work on a UK machine.
192076920X|3.0|Shantaram is not an easy to read book for three main reasons. Firstly it is a humungous wrist breaker at 900 plus pages. Secondly it does not develop a clear plot and is more of a series of events and incidents loosely strung together. Thirdly it is interspersed with long philosophical passages that are as irritating as speed breakers on a highway.    Even though the book is largely set in Mumbai (Bombay) the characters are mostly foreigners. It is a motley crowd of Afghans, Americans, French, Germans, Iranians, Italians, Nigerians, Pakistanis, Palestinians, and Spaniards, all eking out their livelihood by nefarious and unlawful means. The story is narrated in first person and the narrator (Lin or Linbaba) is an Australian convict on the run after a prison break. The book is thus a long hard look at the dark, seamy side of life.     The book can be roughly divided into three parts. The first is the narrator's life in a city slum, where he sets up a medical clinic based on his rudimentary knowledge of first-aid. The second is his long stint in the city's notorious Arthur Road Jail. The third and easily the best is his sojourn in Afghanistan to aid the Mujahedeen against the Russians. Towards the end, post-Afghanistan, the book rapidly degenerates into maudlin self-pity.    Among the multitude of unforgettable characters that haunt the pages of the book are Khaderbhai, the benevolent but obdurate underworld don for whom Lin develops a paternal affection; Karla, the mysterious green-eyed Swiss-American girl and Lin's unrequited love and Abdullah Taheri, the Iranian henchman who re-defines loyalty. But in marked contrast, the Indian characters Prabhaker, the incredibly naïve tourist guide turned taxi driver and Vikram Patel, Lin's jaunty pal will be remembered for altogether wrong reasons. Both have been deformed into horrible caricatures, most unlike any Indian the author would have interacted in his long stay in Mumbai.     The writing is very powerful but inconsistent. The characters and the settings are sharply delineated with a keen artist's eye for detail. The several passages describing myriad knife fights, assaults and battles are a sheer delight. As one reads them, the choreography plays itself out in front the eyes. And there is a plethora of stomach churning descriptions of extreme squalor and suffering, especially in the prison that are guaranteed to make you queasy. But the long moralizing soliloquies are insufferable. The author stumbles in the use of Hindi and Marathi words and phrases, often getting their spellings and pronunciation wrong. And the frequently used Hindi cuss words made me flinch. Most conspicuously and very uncharacteristic to this genre of writing, sex is sparse allowing the reader to draw obvious conclusions about the writer's mind.     But even such a power packed prose cannot hide the fact that the book is largely superficial. The underworld is merely glossed over without offering any insight into its mysterious labyrinths. The author keeps repeating that he is in love with Mumbai. He sketches charming and exotic vignettes of the city vibrant life, yet fails to dig deep into its soul. I say this with all my authority as a denizen of Mumbai for many decades.      It is no secret that this is a near autobiographic work. Hence, in the final analysis, the book is a personal catharsis of the author; a desperate exercise in exculpation and redemption from his crimes and sins. In this journey of salvation the author fails to take the reader along with him. It is difficult to empathize with him in his frequent bouts of wallowing in self-pity. During Lin's visit to Prabakher's native village, the villagers gave him the name Shantaram (peaceful man), but he is a tormented soul all through the book and even beyond.
B0017MO10U|3.0|I loved the story and thoroughly enjoyed the story.  The one problem I had was the sound mix.  The volume of the music and special effects was 4 times that of the voice tracks.  When the music came on I couldn't hear the actors.  If I turned up the volume to hear the actors, the music was hurting my ears.  I had to ride the volume control all through the movie and turn on closed caption to get what the actors were saying.  I hope no one else has the same problem.
B00028HBKM|3.0|I'm going to warn you now...I am reviewing this film as an OBJECTIVE MOVIE-GOER, not a religious zealot. If you think just because of the subject matter this film should be considered immune from criticism, it may be best to skip my words here.    For those of you still with me...    This film could have been so good, yet falls short in so many ways. First of all, though not devoutly religious, I have no doubt that Christ existed and have read the Gospels. Religion, especially in film, is so subjective, it's nearly impossible to classify it in any conventional sense. This film is obviously driven by Mel Gibson's undeniable faith, and at times it shines brightly. I give it high marks for intensity, but I wouldn't call it moving or spiritually enlightening.    First of all, the good: the subtitles are an excellent device. I thought it offered great authenticity to what could be defined as the single most revered day in history. Technically, I thought the cinematography, visual effects and score were also excellent. The roles of Jesus, Pilate and Mary were well done for the most part. In fact, perhaps the most captivating part of the film was the relationship between Jesus and Mary, though even that was barely touched upon. And again, the relationship between Pilate and his wife Claudia were better captured than the compassion for Christ.    The bad: Just about everything else. In terms of a film, we expect an arc of story, or a plot. This film offers none. It's not a story, it's a sequence. Had Gibson focused more on Christ and who He was and what He taught, this film would have packed way more of a punch. It also might have sent a more profound message instead of what I took it as, which is sheer guilt.    The acting, especially on the parts of the Romans, seemed very forced and cartoon-ish. The Jewish high priests were also one dimensional. The bloodshed, though at first effective, quickly became the focus of the film instead of why we should care that it's happening. I don't think that the bloodshed was unnecessary, but certainly excessive and over the top. It's good to see the darkest aspects of what Christ endured, but there comes a point where all Gibson's doing is establishing that torment, over and over and over. Nothing moves forward, it's just regurgitation.    Gibson doesn't offer any reason for us to care what's happening. I found myself relating to it strictly from a humanity standpoint, where I sympathized with Jesus only out of compassion for his physical endurance. But I felt the same for Sean Penn in Dead Man Walking, where he plays the part of a convicted rapist and murderer condemned to death. Hmmm, what's wrong with this picture?    As an example of misdirection, instead of making the March to Golgotha scene several minutes long, shorten it up. Use the rest of that time to COMPLETE the scenes of the Last Supper, or the Sermon on the Mount. These snippet scenes, that consist no more than 15-20 seconds each, are the only link to who Christ was or allowed me to feel connected spiritually. But the second I was compelled by that, it's back to the torture and bloodshed. I'm sorry, but that's just HORRIBLE writing and directing. Seriously.    I think my biggest complaint is the message here, which is guilt, guilt, guilt. Regardless of Gibson's intent, that's all that was conveyed as far as I'm concerned. I interpret the teachings of Christ to be that of love, forgiveness and peace. And though there are glimmers (and I mean glimmers) of those teachings in the film, they are too sparse to compensate for the bloodshed. And though I am familiar with the Gospels and understood everything that was happening, from beginning to end, I still left scratching my head. Bottom line, if you're not familiar with the story of Christ and His death, this is a very hollow film.    And to quickly touch base on all of the controversy this film has stirred, here's my two cents: I don't think the film is anti-Semitic. I didn't have a hardtime with the gore or bloodshed. I think it's pretty strange to read people's reviews that INSIST you take your kids to see this film, and it should be used as a teaching device, when really, it teaches NOTHING about who Christ was, or what He taught.    I commend Gibson for his faith and vision to bring something to life that has affected his life in profound ways. THAT is truly amazing, and in my opinion, the very essence of faith and what it can do to mend souls. But in terms of a commercial film to be shown to the masses, there's really not a whole lot here.    I wonder, would Christ Himself approve of this film's focus? I highly doubt it.
0321525655|5.0|First I wanna thanks Amazon for made everthing works. Nice job.  This book is really good. Nice way to learn about presentations and make it much more atractive.
B00005JPY0|4.0|This is one of those rare films where my expectations were not only a bit higher than normal, but they were also equally fulfilled.    Nolan is giving us a number of stories here, almost more like a Gotham Chronicles story than JUST a Batman story. This film is as much about Jim Gordon, Harvey Dent and even the every day people of Gotham as much as it is about Bruce Wayne/Batman or the Joker.    What impressed me about the writing is how Nolan was able to convey, in a very real-world sense, the anxiety and life-questions that a man like Bruce Wayne would have to make as a true, living breathing crime fighting vigilante. There was cause and effect of being such a figure and his impact had more repercussions than he foresaw. The psychological warfare between Batman and the Joker (even Dent) is mostly well-handled and illustrated, adding a nice layer of richness to the film's finished product. However, sometimes Nolan tries to include TOO MUCH, and there's times where scenes are left a bit unfinished or have loose ends, which is too bad, but mostly forgivable.    On the flip-side of \\"real-world\\" sensibility, one personal disappointment is that the credo of Nolan's Batman about \\"realism\\" (technically and physically) is nowhere to be found here. All the care and effort to explain Batman's gadgets, his trials and errors as a rooftop leaping vigilante all are gone. We don't see the time it takes Wayne to develop something of Fox's into his Batsuit or repertoire. In one scene he's shown it, the next he's using it in almost unbelievable scope and fashion. Much of the action demands much more suspension of disbelief (unlike in Begins), and a lot of it plays out like a James Bond film. In fact, this is more or less \\"Batman 007\\", which ultimately, isn't such a bad thing since we're talking comic source material here. Nolan makes up for this deviation with purely satisfying Batman fanfare action sequences and capturing our hero at his best.    The film is a bit bleak and very dark in tone - Nolan doesn't pull a lot of punches and the result is plenty of moments of grim suspense and anticipation. This is wholly satisfying for many Batman fans, especially the Joker, who is played at his darkest core. I found myself holding my breath with anticipation at a few moments, and Nolan seems to change up the outcomes JUST enough to keep you guessing. I wouldn't recommend this to kids under 12 or so. Not so much gory, as it is intense subject matter and mature themes.    I found the performances of all the cast to be top-notch. In fact, the Joker (exceptionally well-played by Ledger) begins the film as a question mark, and ends it just the same, which I think was sort of the angle here. His purpose is more or less to force Batman to question his own limits and reasons for purpose, using madness for this reason above logic, making him Batman's most enigmatic foe.    We also get to see the promotion of Jim Gordon to Commissioner, which was anticipated given his lesser badge status in Begins. Oldman steps up his game from Begins, and his role serves as the best view for the audience.    Maggie Gyllenhaal is a more watchable Rachel Dawes, but her character is little more than a device here. By the end of the Dark Knight, it's clear her purpose was far better suited in Begins as Bruce's childhood friend. Still, Gyllenhaal is plenty serviceable and doesn't take an ounce away here.    Harvey Dent is perhaps, the biggest surprise of the story and I was impressed with Aaron Eckhart's performance. His story is perhaps the greatest arc of the film, although I thought his \\"point of no return\\" was a little rushed and hard to believe.    Morgan Freeman is back as our new favorite \\"Q\\", Lucias Fox, offering up new technology for Batman's disposal...but we also get to see a bit of his role as head of Wayne Corporation and his own personal convictions and responsibilities.    In the end, I would qualify the Dark Knight as the the best Batman film to date, going back as far as you want to. I can also say this is quite possibly the best COMIC film to date. But what surprised me, was that this was one of the best CRIME films I've seen in a long time.    The Dark Knight offers plenty of bang for your buck.
159562015X|4.0|This book really helps the readers to focus on their strengths vs. weakness fixing.  It is one of the books where you catch yourself saying \\"oh that is why I do that or think like that\\".  The concepts allow us to learn more about ourselves and have a broad application from home to work.  This is a true culture change of thought and I am surely on board with it.  Invest your time with the assessment and the development plan.  It really does allow customization specifically to YOU!
0785123490|5.0|This is a fantastic series and one of the first comic story arcs that really got my attention and kept it all the way through.    I admit that I may have had an unfair advantage, as my appetite was plenty whet from the Thanos Quest prequel books (mini-series), which is among my favorite collections to this day.    The beauty is that you don't have to be that interested in comics to enjoy this. Even a casual fan will appreciate the story that Starlin has laid out here, which is layered and compelling.    But for those looking for a more detailed synopsis...    Thanos, now equipped with the complete power of an all-powerful god takes on what seems like the entire Marvel universe in an epic battle that at times if flat out bizarre. I don't want to spoil anything, but let's just say you'll see more than a fair share of Marvel characters enduring strange fates indeed.    The beauty of it is that all of Thanos' efforts are to win the cold heart of his lover, Death. Therein lies the beauty of Starlin's entire Infinity series - its core villain's ambitions are in the name of something that is all too human.
6305311463|5.0|I have to admit that this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  There are very few movies that even try to touch on almost every emotion and this one does it well in my opinion.  For those who didn't like it, I am guessing that they were trying to relate it to reality.  Movies like this aren't meant for that.  They are meant for their entertainment value and this is full of it. There is action, comedy, drama, suspense, and a little horror.  Awesome!
B00005JPFH|3.0|As a die-hard Spider-Man fan, I enjoyed this film. As a film critic, there's a lot to be desired.    The action and effects are easily the best in the series. Some of the most stunning effects I have seen. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue is probably the worst.    The Good: I appreciate what elements Sam Raimi brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiote. It's a gutsy move to include it, because it's a stretch for the casual Spider-Man fan to digest an alien coming down and taking over Peter Parker (& Brock), but hey, it's true to the comic.    I also loved the Sandman action sequences, good use of his powers. But making him the gunman of Peter's uncle Ben was a little over the top for me, especially given the ending. To Raimi's defense, at least they give you SOME reason to understand the Sandman's motivations. I was really hoping Venom would be better utilized but he was more of a one-hit wonder character than anything substantial. He's more used as a device to demonstrate the alien's power over people.    In the end, the action sequences are wonderful and thrilling and found myself wanting to rewind and watch is slow motion more than once.    The Bad: Much of the dialogue is forced, failing to flow nearly as easily or believably as 1 or 2. Tobey Maguire seems far less comfortable with the character in this film, which is surprising and unfortunate. Too many homage scenes too, where the writers felt they should give EVERY character that's been in any of the first films at least 5-10 minutes of screen time (like the landlord and his daughter.) This was a huge complaint I had about Pirates II...give us substance instead of what you THINK we want to see more of.    Also, there's times where scenes are so unbelievable from a HUMAN standpoint, you almost can't believe the scene was ever approved. Case in point - in one scene, Gwen Stacy barely clings to a damaged building, dangling 30 stories up. Below are her father and boyfriend watchingfrom the street. One would think they would be panic stricken, especially the father. Instead, both as docile as two strangers watching the evening news. They are so blase in fact, that Brock (Stacey's BF) takes the opportunity to tell the her father that he's been dating her. Meanwhile, she's second from death. I felt more panic from the extra in Spider-Man 1 where she's waiting to see if her baby is rescued from a burning building.    And my biggest issue should not be news to Hollywood - GOOD MOVIES DO NOT NEED TO BE 2.5 HOURS LONG! This movie could have EASILY dropped 30-40 minutes and been a great film. They spend WAY too long on needless scene after needless scene (the part where Parker shows up with Stacy at the Jazz club could have been a 5 minute scene; instead, it's dragged on for 15 minutes and it's not even a good scene.) What's worse, many of these unnecessary scenes are redundant - how many dramatic scenes do we need to illustrate the tension between Parker and MJ? I didn't count, but it seemed like 20 when there only needed to be maybe 3.    In the end, despite my complaints, I did enjoy the film. It's a must-see on the big screen given its effects and cinematography. If there is a SM4, let's hope for a less contrived and convoluted script.
B0018O4YT0|4.0|I saw the movie twice at the theatre when it was released back in the 20th century ;)     I enjoyed the film very much at that time but I must say I've always been very frustrated about the editind... It seemed the first 25 minutes where just a juxtaposition of sequences with no real link together, no explanation, to fast and even the music was not really synchronised...    I was expecting a Director's cut for a long time and I can say that IT IS MUCH MUCH BETTER!! The plot line is now smoother, the intrigue ellaborates with good rythm, the quality of the image is sharp and the music is less a background noise this time and more efficient. Plus the commentaries are instructives and the interviews very informative.    IN A WORD: Buy the Director's cut and throw the old dvd away...     My only complaint: for a dvd made in Canada (mine was) there is no french subtitles (only a third of Canada speaks French after all! -ironic laugh-)
B00005JLWN|4.0|I enjoyed this film, but make no mistake - it is a popcorn film, so take it for what it's worth.    Not even being an avid film or literary buff, I could name half a dozen other films or books this movie borrows from - the action (the Matrix), premise of thought police (Orwell's \\"1984\\"), mood control (Dick's \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\") and even the final scene (Fight Club).    The biggest problem for me is the premise itself as I found it somewhat difficult to believe - the idea that to eliminate the threat of war, society has been reduced to the point where they all consciously (though under law) sedate themselves, lest they \\"feel\\", which is punishable by death with no due process or trial. I had a difficult time taking scenes seriously where cops are raiding warehouses where stereotypical thugs are moving illegal goods such as...paintings? Lamps? Trinkets? I guess Wimmer needed some physical representation for people being guilty of \\"feeling\\", but these types of notions just seemed like reaching for straws.    Being such a far-fetched reality is problematic is more ways than just the suspension of disbelief of the viewer - it also makes it nearly impossible for the actors to remain true to the premise. There are times when the authoritative figures themselves show emotions of happiness, satisfaction, or anger. It really seems more like a drug that eliminates all GOOD feelings, not ALL feelings. This is also consistent with how the law is upheld.    I felt the above problems could be solved in one of two ways:    1. Set in an obviously DISTANT future. This is how the Matrix sells the idea of us being \\"batteries\\" in a completely dystopia earth. Yes, Equilibrium is clearly set in the future, but there is little to suggest that it isn't near future. There's really no futuristic technology, so again, the idea of \\"feeling\\" being illegal (something that makes up our very essence) is just too far fetched for most viewers.    2. The other means of fixing it would be to have set the entire thing on an alien planet with an alien race. In my opinion, this would have been the best setting as it takes away from our innate rejection of such a premise and ultimately, a more original idea.    Even given the above complaints, the film has great production value. Wimmer does a nice job of putting you in this world. I felt the pacing was good and it was as well acted as one could hope under the film's premise. There were moments that did their job, such as several \\"crossroads\\" scenes, where Bale's character is put on the spot, between a rock and a hard place and you hold your breath wondering what he'll do.    In the end, if you're looking for a decent sci-fi futuristic action flick, this is certainly worth a viewing. If you're a film stickler and bent on original content, or something overly cerebral, it's probably a pass.
B0019FOC5E|4.0|I recently saw the play in Spokane, Wa and it was great energy and great songs.  The movie was also very entertaining as it was on a big screen.  Some of the actors who sung like Pierce shouldn't give up their day jobs.  I already have the sound track and would have bought the movie soundtrack but it doesn't have all the songs on it that were in the movie and on stage.  Shouldnt have messed with the soundtrack

0385340567|1.0|Since discovering Jack Reacher, I have always looked forward to the next book in the series.  \\"Nothing To Lose\\" was a major disappointment.  Reacher books are usually page turners in a good way, but with NTL I often found myself turning pages to see how much more I had to read to get to what I hoped would be a more interesting chapter (didn't happen very often).      In the interest of full disclosure, Child's apparent left-wing political leanings (as voiced through Jack Reacher in this book) are not mine.  I have read and been entertained by books that leaned to the left, but, unfortunately, this book isn't what I would call entertainment.    Reacher has been a great series, but for my money it is one book too long.  In the past I have passed my Reacher books on to friends who also enjoy the series, but this one is going into a storage box in the basement.
B00005JNS0|5.0|First off, I didn't care for the movie the first time I saw it.  I'm not much of an Owen Wilson fan, and I would never watch NASCAR.  However, this is my sons favorite movie.  So, after watching it more than 200 times (I wish I were exaggerating), I can honestly say I love the movie and feel it's one of the best to date.      The movie has a number of memorable characters too.    There is so much detail in the movie, it's fun for my wife and I to pick it out.  Like the automobile fenders and wheel wells that make up the mountain ranges.  The lost couple that come into town looking for directions to the interstate, their names being \\"Mini\\" and \\"Van\\" (they are minivans).  How passing planes leave tire tracks in the sky.  These are only a few among many.    Also, after watching it in HD, you won't want to watch it in low def again.  The detail is excellent.  The overall plot is predictable, but still entertaining, and offers typical Disney/Pixar moral values.      Highly recommended for all age groups.
B000E1MTY0|5.0|After purchasing my HD DVD player, Batman Begins was the first movie on my list to buy. I've seen the movie in the theater and had it on regular DVD. It's become one of my favorites. But watching it on HD DVD was better than expected. The clarity of the picture was outstanding. This movie was on TV in HD right after I bought the HD DVD version and it could not compare to picture quality of the HD DVD. If you own a HD DVD player and like this movie, getting the HD DVD version is the best way to see it.
B0017XOF5A|1.0|The movie was ok, as much as a let down as 200 was, but at least it was ok.  Blu-ray on a decent TV makes this thing look like utter and complete crap.  I returned it to the store to get the DVD because at least that doesn't look as bad.    The lack of quality on the picture makes me ashamed to be a fan.
0385340990|5.0|If you love books, reading and wonderful characters who appreciate both this is the book for you. This will be added to my special list of favorites to be read again and again.
1554072840|5.0|we couldn't be happier with \\"once upon a potty\\" .. we received it, along with cotton trainers, when our girl was 22 months old ... she had already been exhibiting all the classic ready-for-pottying cues, with regular morning & after nap pee-pee-ing, so the addition of prudence's story was the icing on the cake that gave her the confidence to really go full-time for the potty.    it's a confidence booster, and we adore it ( though we did change the potty language to suit our family : no biggie! ) and it will be a treasured selection in her library forever.    alona, thank you for writing a smart book for smart kids.
B001B71NOI|4.0|Since his divorce from Interscope in 2007, Trent Reznor has wasted little time in making new material available to the public, with the latest Nine Inch Nails offering being \\"The Slip\\".  Coming only two months after Reznor's release of the instrumental \\"Ghosts I-IV\\", \\"The Slip\\" is a riveting album that borderlines perfection, but never quite gets there and seems to almost meander as it winds down to it's conclusion.  Standout tracks, including \\"1,000,000\\", \\"Discipline\\", \\"Echoplex\\", and \\"Demon Seed\\" are pure Nine Inch Nails all the way, while \\"Corona Radiata\\" just comes off as a little too predictable for my tastes.  The album as a whole seems to go by a little speedier to expected as well, and doesn't quite leave the lasting impression that one would hope compared to nearly everything else Nine Inch Nails has released over the past few years.  However, all flaws aside, \\"The Slip\\" is still a more than solid release that delivers the goods that NIN fans expect, and while it isn't spectacular, \\"The Slip\\" is a success purely thanks to the fact that Trent can now do what he wants (and when he wants) without being handcuffed by a label.  And that alone is reason enough to celebrate.
0440238609|5.0|I bought the trilogy looking for an opportunity for my imagination to take wing.  Philip Pullman does a great job of bringing this adult back to her childhood and the ready fantasy I found there when learning how to interpret and understand a complex world.  I loved the drama, passion, and loyalty of the heroine.  It's an exceptional read. . .

0783225849|5.0|Alfred Hitchcock wired Anthony Perkins to apologise on behalf of his film-making colleagues, after Perkins was denied an Oscar for his portrayal of Norman Bates. Perkins's performance is indeed remarkable, mature and haunting.    The shower sequence is a masterpiece, but I think the scene in Bates's parlour where he and Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) discuss life - including Mother - is a poignant and brilliant performance by Perkins.    Perkins became tragically typecast, but he transformed Robert Bloch's ugly-mannered Bates into a youthfull and tender-natured man. Psycho is an outright classic.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|This is what happens when a good balanced breakfast meets good songwriting meets great singer meets keyboard rifts approved by Burns meets visual bliss meets my third girlfriend meets a cold night in Gretna. Mamma Mia is just brilliant. I've seen it 32 times and most times will now run up to the front of the theater to perform the musical in it's entirety. Our band, Asschowder, has been doing parts of Mamma Mia in our show for the last 15 years. Burns is blessed with an ability to take what ABBA came up with, insult it and turn it into something with a point. Burns + Keyboards= Point and I'm talking in a \\"point, winner\\" kind of way in Karate Kid. J Abs flat runs circles around what ABBA did on guitar both literally and figuratively. We have a cardboard cutout of ABBA that we place on stage during the ABBA portion of our set. J abs literally runs circles around it while playing leadbass guitar. I sing both the male and female parts in my David Hasselhoff voice, ensuring that the ladies in the audience will be happy. One look at us would ensure that, but we are all about quality communication.    If you get a chance to see Mamma Mia at a theater with me, you are in for a treat. If you just see the movie, you might be happy. If you just simply see me, I'll probably cause you to break off your current relationship with your boyfriend. He's just not right for you. I heard he's into Sarah anyway. He isn't going anywhere with his job and is just staying with you until Sarah breaks up with Chet. So just save yourself the heartache later and break it off now. You're welcome.
B0013FYTA8|1.0|This band blows!! I can not put it in any simpler terms. I've never heard a band try so hard to sound like everyone else, especially Nickelback. Even worse 'Bad Girlfriend' sounds like Nickelback ripping off The Cult's 'Fire Woman'. I think they should come out and say \\"We're a Nickelback tribute band\\". I'd have a little more respect for them if they did, but not much more. This is the result of record labels and producers formulating a sellable sound. This is why the record industry is going down the toilet and I think it's getting what it deserves.
B00009Z574|3.0|Talk about a 360.  After doing 4 albums in a row with songs in the 15 to 20 minute range being the average, Yes went the other direction with \\"Tormato\\".  The longest track on the disc is a little over 7 minutes with most of the rest of the album being in the four to five minute range.  Some Yes fans wrote the band off completely as selling out.  This is definitely a transitional album for the band where they deliberately tried to change up their sound and style in an attempt to remain relevant.  The result was an album that careens between some really good songs and several \\"what the hell were they thinking\\" moments.  The good songs include \\"Future Times / Rejoice\\", \\"Madrigal\\", \\"Release Release\\", \\"Onward\\" and \\"On The Silent Wings Of Freedom\\".  These are all very nice tracks and although shorter than what Yes fans may have come to expect make the album worth owning.  On the other hand songs like \\"Don't Kill The Whale\\", \\"Arriving UFO\\", and \\"Circus Of Heaven\\" are cringe inducing in spots.  The up and down nature of this album is pretty amazing really when you compare it to the discs that came before it.  In the end I think this is one of the band's weaker efforts, but is still worth owning for the good stuff on it.
0312965788|5.0|The classic story based on the real life experience of a veterinarian in Yorkshire, England. James Herriot comes to Darrowby during a time when jobs are scarce and he needs to stay. But he finds he loves the people and the animals.<br /><br />His associates are a lively bunch. His boss, Siegfried Farnon, is kindhearted, but has an annoying habit of contradicting himself (and then blaming it on James). Siegfried's brother, Tristan Farnon, is the younger almost-vet who is stuck with the worst jobs, loves the ladies and a drink or two. The farmers and neighbors are generally are hardworking lot. Their stories give the true color of the place and time. James also meets Helen Alderson, the beautiful and enchanting daughter of a farmer.<br /><br />The classic tale was also turned into a BBC series (7 seasons). I would highly recommend both!
B00007LTIC|5.0|After the \\"Relayer\\" album and tour the band took three years off.   Some of the members did solo albums, and keyboardist Patrick Moraz left the band. Ex-keyboardist Rick Wakeman returned to the fold bringing a massive Swiss church organ with him.  \\"Going For The One\\" has a bit of a history for me.  It is the album where I both discovered the band and also almost wrote them off.  I had gotten into progressive rock in the late 70's through the band Kansas.  After discovering that this whole thing called prog existed I started to explore some of the other big names in the genre and one of the first albums I picked up was Yes's \\"Going For The One\\".  Prior to that I had heard \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"All Good People\\", but really did not know what Yes was all about.  The first time I listened to this album I just did not get it at all.  I gave it about 5 spins and although I acknowledged that the musicians were stellar I thought the material pretty much sucked.  I put the album away and pretty much wrote Yes off.  A few months later I decided to pull the album out again and give it one more try, and for some reason this time it clicked.  Today \\"Going For The One\\" remains my all time favorite Yes album.  To me it is the perfect mix of shorter (by prog standards) more accessible tunes like \\"Parallels\\" and \\"Wondrous Stories\\", sweeping epic ballads like \\"Turn Of The Century\\", and long epic almost classical pieces like the cornerstone of the album \\"Awaken\\".  Even my least favorite track \\"Going For The One\\" has grown on me over the years.  I really love this album and to me the 16 minute finale \\"Awaken\\" pretty much is the pinnacle of what Yes is all about.  It still can give me goose bumps when I listen to it.  \\"Turn Of The Century\\" is one of Jon Anderson's finest moments, and \\"Parallels\\" is an energetic rocker written by Chris Squire that begs to be turned up to 11.   The single \\"Wondrous Stories\\" is just a cool little song that only a band like Yes could do.  There are so many greatand often subtle moments on this album that it is impossible to describe them all.  Steve Howe shines all over this disc with his pedal steel work on the title track, the great acoustic interludes on \\"Turn Of The Century\\", and especially the guitar solo in \\"Awaken\\".  In my opinion it is his all time best moment on guitar and probably a one off.  \\"Awaken\\" is my favorite Yes track and ranks right up near the top of my all time favorite progressive rock tracks.  It is everything that great prog should be.  It just melds into you and is incredible to listen to on a good stereo system or with high quality headphones.  This album took a while to grow on me and it probably is not what I would recommend to Yes newbie's, but \\"Going For The One' has become one of my all time favorite progressive rock albums, and my favorite album by Yes.

076790592X|4.0|Although this book doesn't tell us anything we don't already know, it never does any harm to be reminded from time to time. It's a heartwarming and truthful account of a friendship between an older man in the last months of his life and a younger man who has always been inspired by him.<br /><br />We're reminded of the importance of caring for one another in a world where we simply don't take time often enough (sometimes never!) to tell people how much we love and appreciate them.<br /><br />It doesn't shy away from the 'ugly' side of illness and death which people wonder and worry about but hardly ever discuss. It's only human to be scared and to have self pity but we learn how Morrie turned his negative emotions into positive ones, and fear into acceptance and inner peace.<br /><br />I found 'Tuesdays With Morrie' a refreshingly honest account of illness. Instead of being depressing it was insightful and moving.

0723257639|5.0|I bought this box as a gift to my family, as we have always loved the stories by Beatrix Potter. We've had a couple of books standing in the bookshelf since we (the parents of the family) were small ourselves. We have two boys ages 6 and 3, and both of them have fallen in love with Peter Rabbit, Benjamin Bunny and the rest of the animals.    The box itself is both handy and pretty, and we placed it directly in our bookshelf. The books inside are the same as the ones that can be bought separately, and they all contain Potter's beautiful artwork and well-written stories.    All in all we, the whole faily, are very pleased with this buy. It just couldn't get better.    I'm also really pleased with the prices here at Amazon, as we would have to pay about $300 for this boxed set in Norway.
0451196716|5.0|I am currently reading Stephen King's memoir \\"On Writing\\". In it he describes \\"The Long Walk\\" as probably the best of his early books. He is absolutely correct.    This book gives just another example of what he is able to do with character development. He doesn't use them as simple plot tools, but creates actual people that we develop a relationship with while reading their story.    In this book the main characters are a group of young men who have entered a contest that sounds ridiculously heinous to us, but has become the norm to them. (the story is unofficially set in a future and place not too far from where we now live)    When I first heard the premise of this book I was immediately interested. The author did not fail to exceed the expectations of this \\"constant reader\\". Whether you are a Stephen King fan or not I would recommend this book to you. It's brief, to the point, and extremely good.
0743290119|2.0|This book was awful. The story was boring, the characters whined and complained, and after almost 300 pages, not much had happened. If you are looking for an entertaining, fun read, sadly this isn't it.<br /><br />Weisberger could have used a good editor herself for this novel. If she had cut out one of the main characters, maybe she could have developed the story more. She touches on multiple story lines, never really drawing the reader into any of them, and then abruptly wraps things up at the end--so abruptly that a typo at the end identifies one of the main characters, Leigh, as Leah.<br /><br />I loved \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" and \\"Everyone Worth Knowing,\\" so I had high expectations for this book and was very disappointed.
B0002BO0US|5.0|Especially the last part of \\"Hung Up On A Dream\\" that I could listen to forever. At points the lead vocals remind of \\"Chelsea Girl\\" era Nico, and that's a good thing.  The idea that most people only view The Zombies as the band who sang \\"Time of the Season\\" and \\"She's Not There\\" is ridiculous, and I was one of those people only a few weeks ago.      Along with 'Arthur' (By The Kinks for those who are unlucky to not have heard it) and 'Forever Changes' (By Love, and you have to hear \\"Alone Again Or\\"), this is the third melodic masterpiece of the late 60s not made by The Beatles.  So for those who believe The Zombies are only good for soundtracking an Austin Powers movie, this album shows why John Lennon and The Hollies both wanted to produce an album for the band.
B001675YQ6|4.0|In a genre littered with hundreds of samey quickly-forgotten offerings of mediocre quality, this one differentiates itself surprisingly well.  The story is older than Shakespeare:  girl meets boy, boy likes girl, but the inevitable misunderstandings contrive to keep them apart until the end.  Nothing new, but what raises \\"Love\\" from the crowd is both its shameless tongue-in-cheek manner and its distinctly British sensibility - as present in some scathingly hilarious dialogue.  It won't be everyone's cup of tea, certainly, but if you're a fan of British (or just plan snarky) humour, and you enjoy movies that don't take themselves seriously, I can't recommend this one to you enough.
B000058983|5.0|\\"Oh, the snot has caked against my pants/It has turned into crystal.\\"     That's how 'Live And Let Live' begins, and it is easy to see why this was Jim Morrison's favorite band.  Acoustic guitars everywhere and beautiful harmonies The Beatles would love, and I could not recommend this anymore.    I have listened to \\"Pet Sounds\\" and while I tolerated it I didn't see what all the big deal was, but this...My introduction to Love was the song 'Always See Your Face' in the movie \\"High Fidelity\\" and instantly I had to know what it was.  I listened to the song quite a few times, but this album is even better.  After \\"Alone Again Or\\" I was hooked.   While this album could easily be a soundtrack to a great music film never made, the closer 'You Set The Scene' plays like a film on its own.    \\"There's a private in my boat and he wears  Pins instead of medals on his coat  There's a chicken in my nest and she won't  Lay until I've given her my best\\"    Does it really mean anything?  I don't know, but I like it.  And I think you will too.
B000WDXNSQ|5.0|Sometimes you can forget what is important and what is the truth. Work, careers, money, conflict, relationships even the godamn weather. For those of you who manage to still grasp a few straws of reality and remember that there is an untamed natural world out there waiting to be challenged, this album may as well be \\"that\\" voice in the back of your mind.    I always thought Ed the Ved untapped his magic long ago, and was still capable of marching on with moments of pure genius -- that said this record is outstandingly good on its own merit, regardless of its minimalist approach and length. Ed has p e r f e c t l y narrated the 'Into the Wild' film with this folk-rock bittersweet reflection on what Christopher McCandless might have been thinking.     Definitely one of the finest albums of the millenium.    ~paul browne    paulbrowneart.co.uk
B0018OAPAW|5.0|I have grown up listening to Offspring, from their first self-titled album to now, and I have to say that though their sound has evolved quite a bit from where they started out, every album they've put out has been consistently awesome.  This most recent album has a more produced sound which may take a bit of getting used to, but I found myself loving the album from the first listen. Along with many catchy tunes, it features a few more soulful songs than previous albums, notably Kristy Are You Doing Okay and Fix You. Though these are not the classic style of Offpsring, they are brilliantly written pieces of music, and should not be scorned.  It comes down to the fact that the band writes music for themselves, not to please audiences. I am glad that their music has stayed consistent in quality and that they have avoided the trap of making every album sound the same (I could name other bands here but I won't =P).
B0019HQIGS|4.0|excellent sound and picture, bought dvd and cd both.  The cd has been in the truck for over week (a true test of repeated listening).
B00005B36H|5.0|Over the previous 12 years, I had already bought each of this band's other albums.  This one is my favorite!  It marks a dramatic point of transformation during the band's development ... call it perhaps a higher dimension of consciousness.  The artist Alex Grey was a positive influence on the members, who themselves were already very intelligent, sensitive, powerful.    Prior to my first listen through it, I was having some trouble in life.  The music served as a catalyst into the mental healing process, and it worked more powerfully than almost any experience I'd ever had.    !    Jeremy  myspace.com/jwjarvislisten
B001CXW8CW|2.0|I'm not a fan of the Batman movies, so my review might not be worth much. I saw this with some other people, and we all thought that it was too long, but that the special effects were spectacular. The acting and the story seem mediocre. I guess we just aren't fans enough of Batman to give this more than 2 stars. I'd say - rent it, or wait until it gets on TV. I definitely wouldn't want to own it, because then I'd have to see it more than once. Once was enough.
B00005K3OT|4.0|Maybe there isn't much difference - but Vianne's is more magical than most. She spends her life as a wanderer, bringing with her chocolate recipes that descend from the Mayas, but with preparation to tempt the most refined Europeans. The story starts when she and her daughter wander into a small city in France that dates back to the middle ages. It's a walled city, filled with walled people, the kind affronted by opening a chocolate shop during Lent and nastily eager to note the mother's never-married state.<br /><br />But, with a lot of determination and a little magic, Vianne wins them over, one palate at a time. As she helps bring people together, heal rifts, and create second chances for the townspeople, one wonders why the charm doesn't work on her own life. Then, Roux (played by Johnny Depp) appears, even more of a wanderer than Vianne. Instant affinity arises between these two roamers, but instant enmity comes from the deep-rooted locals - how dare they not live lives as staid as the villagers' own?<br /><br />Based on chocolate, you just know that this has to end up as a feel-good movie; I'm not spoiling any surprises there. As in [[ASIN:B000NVT0T8 The Mistress of Spices]], primal forces of the kitchen bring peace and happiness in the end.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00005JPY0|5.0|Contradictory to endless super-hyped big budgets films with fancy trailers, this one delivers the goods promised. I have been following this film ever since Lt. Gordon pulled out that fateful card at the end of a brilliant \\"Batman Begins\\". Following this trail has been a 3 year affair and as a die hard Batman Fan(atic), I was actually more nervous than excited at the prospect of finally seeing this film. On hand I knew that Christopher Nolan and \\"Cast & Crew\\" wouldn't really muck it up but on the other, it takes one greedy studio executive with an ego to decide the fate of the product delivered...thankfully, that was not the case!!  From the 1st trailer to the 2nd to the 3rd, the prospect of this film making history becomes more and more apparent. As for the marketing, to have one half of perfectly sane people paint their faces and parade around town in the guise of lunacy coupled with the other half campaigning in their city's for a non existent District Attorney is nothing short of  PURE GENIUS! The Viral Campaign (which I followed closely too) made the film all the more intriguing and by the time 18th July '08 came, a final question was still lingering in my mind: Would The Dark Knight live up to the Hype?   To my luck and too my wishes, The Dark Knight Crushed! The filmmaking was Grade \\"A\\", the story (which filmmakers have a tendency to go overboard with sequels) was the finest balance that could have been struck between comic and film, the actors were nothing short of amazing and most importantly the product on the whole delivered 100%  30 seconds (literally) into the movie, I knew I was in for the ride of my life and by the end credits, I was ready to go on this ride for the second time.   Heath Ledger's Joker shone, just as Christian Bale's Batman did in Batman Begins (and in The Dark Knight for that matter) There are no words that can fully express the magnitude of his performance, but I will say this in a staunchly heterosexual way: \\"I couldn't get my eyesoff The Joker.\\" Aaron Eckhart was superb in portraying Harvey Dent's tragic struggle with duality. The physical scarring looks Dead On! (no pink paint this time round thankfully) Maggie Gyllenhaal made a much better Rachael Dawes the Katie Holmes, probably comes largely from the fact that the character itself is not superfluous like she was in the last one. Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman do tend to make anything look good and this was no exception .A special thanks to Gary Oldman for giving me The Commissioner I've always wanted to see done right. Watching him play Gordan page for page is nothing short of raw pleasure.    To the filmmakers, rather than merely supporting their film to the hilt (which I am as you can see) I really would like to genuinely thank Christopher Nolan and Crew for giving me 2 of the greatest films I've seen and for literally bringing Batman's Universe to life. I've seen it 4 times already and am definitely going for 5.  There is no guessing how many stars I'm giving this one...I just wish I could give it 6...(or more)
B00004T1NA|4.0|My general impression of Lightbulb Sun (2000) was that it was somewhat lighter than the usual fare, but certainly not without its shining moments.  The album finds the group in a transitional period where they were exploring a lighter sound.  Indeed, I feel that some of their most accessible albums were made during this period (Lightbulb Sun and Stupid Dream [1999]).  Lightbulb Sun would prove to be the last album with drummer Chris Maitland and he turns in some fine performances.<br /><br />At the core of this album (and every Porcupine Tree album for that matter) are haunting/sad minor chords, fine vocals and great musicianship.  There are some differences however.  Atmospheric synthesizer washes are not as dominant, the electric guitar textures are not nearly as heavy as used on subsequent albums, and the band seemed to be focusing on concise, almost \\"pop-ish\\" tunes.  Although an obvious example, this is brought to its fullest expression on Four Chords that Made a Million - even in spite of the acerbic and cynical lyrics.  As such, this might be considered one of their most straightforward albums.<br /><br />Of course, at the other end of the spectrum is the lengthy Russia on Ice (13:03) and the gloomy closing track Feel So Low.  Although I wish that Russia on Ice had been arranged differently, I count it among my favorites on Lightbulb Sun, along with Feel So Low and The Rest Will Flow.<br /><br />Although a remastered version of this album has been released, this Snapper UK version is great and certainly suits my needs.  The sound quality is crisp and the CD booklet is of high quality (lyrics, photos of the band members etc.).<br /><br />All in all, this a well crafted album by a very interesting post-progressive band that finds them exploring the lighter side of things.  For those folks that are new to the group, I would personally recommend the following albums: the ambient/\\"proggy\\" album Sky Moves Sideways (1995), the lighter Stupid Dream (1999), the heavier, darker follow-up to Lightbulb Sun - In Absentia (2002), and Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), which is by far the heaviest album I have heard from the group., darker follow-up to Lightbulb Sun - In Absentia (2002), and Fear of a Blank Planet (2007), which is by far the heaviest album I have heard from the group.
B0013LPS8Y|4.0|Love the CD and the guys who have reviewed it really did good jobs, the first disc is great, really good sound, compaired to the original. The second CD is really nothing new if you have all those tracks from the 80's 12\\" and 7\\" craze. I thought they would dump those and add tracks that might have been done during the sessions. Anyway, overall, a great set but not as good as the first two recent remasters because how many times do we really need to hear \\"New Years Day\\" & \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" over & over!<br />Search google, yahoo or msn for our little site \\"Judemac Forever\\" and drop us a visit.

B000ZBPQEO|5.0|Although it will take me weeks to finish listening to this set, I am very glad that EMI issued this set at such a low price.  Many of these recordings are legendary, others are von Karajan's first recordings of symphonies that he would record again and again.  While I have his complete Bruckner, Beethoven and Brahms on DG, in is interesting to hear his earlier thoughts--and they are often splendid.  I am not bothered by the mono recordings; they were produced by Walter Legge and are warmer than many a digital recording that I have purchased.  Legge was initially opposed to stereo and lavished they same detail on his mono productions as on his later, stereo recordings.    What I have enjoyed most so far are some of the discs which were unavailable in the US, and some of the discs that I may not have considered had they been full price.  But at $1.50 a disc, this set allows me to explore discs that I would not normally acquire.  Given the overall quality of the conducting, recordings and the Philharmonia Orchestra, it is the CD bargain of the decade.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Three years ago Batman Begins premiered to a lackluster opening. I went to the first midnight showing of that movie and the auditorium wasn't close to half full. To be honest that movie didn't have the advantage of a big name villain and it really didn't have the advantage of having one of its stars die six months before it opened.    Now we have \\"The Dark Knight\\" a movie that has broken all  records including highest opening day, highest opening weekend, and the quickest movie to reach $300 million at the domestic box office. Well this movie did have plenty of hype and plenty of publicity. The question now does the movie live up to the hype? The answer, I would have to say (after three viewings) is YES!    There is a lot of thought that went into this screenplay. Batman (played by Christian Bale) has become so good at beating the bad guys that they villains turn to desperate measures. Enter The Joker (played by Heath Ledger). He believes that Gotham City is deserving of a better class of criminal. The Joker isn't as much as a criminal though as he is a psychotic who enjoys chaos and destruction.    What can be said about the Joker that hasn't been said yet? Heath Ledger literally does disappear into this role. If I had gone into this movie now knowing any of the cast members I would never have guessed that as Ledger. The Joker is portrayed as a man with no conscious who is willing to let people die and lives be destroyed for the sake of his own amusement. Even if Ledger hadn't of died I would still say this role was worth of an Oscar nomination as his vile character brings a new level of violence and chaos to a crime movie.    The Joker's agenda is to physically and psychologically destroy the lives of those who try to bring law and order to Gotham City. This not only includes Batman but district attorney (Harvey Dent), the girl caught in the middle of a love triangle (played by Rachel Dawes), and Police Commissioner Gordon, played by the always brilliant Gary Oldman. The Joker even messes with Gotham Cities other criminals including mob boss in an underrated performance by Eric Roberts.    Every scene the Joker is in is an attention grabber as he sets out to prove that underneath all the laws and moral codes people are all bad. I am usually disinterested in movies in which the villain stops the action to explain to the hero (usually for the benefit of the audience) how evil he is. This time I didn't mind as The Joker had some pretty interesting things to say. Not only does he deserve an Oscar nomination, but so do the writers.    Even though I have mostly written of the Joker that's not to say the role of Batman is downplayed. He has to make some choices that come very close to crossing morale lines, including eavesdropping on 30 million of Gotham's citizens, much to the dismay of Lucius Fox, played by Morgan Freeman.    And let's not forget Michael Caine. He plays Alfred, Bruce Wayne's loyal butler who provides the sanity that contrasts against all the chaos in this movie. He plays the role with great patience and concern as he worries that each time Bruce Wayne leaves may be his last.    \\"The Dark Knight\\" is a compelling entertainment that last two and a half hours and is not boring for a moment. There are plenty of moments of drama and suspense in which characters have to make life altering choices. And of course, there is plenty of action and a car chase through the middle of Gotham City in which we see get to see the Batcycle. This seen is a hoot.    A lot of people have compared Heath Ledger's Joker to Jack Nicholson's Joker, and a lot of critics have compared this new movie to Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\". All I will say is that \\"The Dark Knight\\" has rendered \\"Batman\\" obsolete.

0385040253|5.0|This is the reference that seems to be used by all other knot books and web sites.      Although the book can be hard to understand when trying to tie knots, no colors, videos or animated gifs, it is quite useful when trying to identify a knot that I want to tie.       I knew what I was getting as I had read the libraries copy before making the decision to purchase so I am not at all disappointed with my book.  This is also an excellent book for reading if you enjoy tying knots.      If you have more than a passing interest in knots then you will want to consider buying this book.

B0017MO10U|2.0|I've seen every Stargate SG1 and Atlantis Episodes and movie.   The reason I didn't like it was the one thing I loved about the shows that for the most part, they were clean. This one had a couple almost gory  scenes. Not to mention the swearing was like star trek 4 and 5, were all of the sudden your Heroes of many years start having potty mouths, it's so unnecessary. I was looking forward to an all new sg1 were they tackle something new, not a rehash of the same old thing. It seems like The industry is turning to the Dark side again with the success of an over the top Dark Knight being so succesful, the feel good adventure will need a comeback. Please bring the SG1 team back for a good adventure!
B000T9OP7G|5.0|!!Very Enterteining!!    I just love the Terminator Franchaise.  And the Girls are HOT!!    Maybe a little nudity for the next season would make it better.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Wow, such strong feelings on this movie! First off, the animation: I think it's well-done, and whether or not it was a good directorial choice is something on which I have no opinion. It is what it is, and as far as I'm concerned, it worked well.<br />There are many complaints about such elements as nudity, rude jokes, Beowulf's boastfulness and \\"silly\\" chest-pounding dialogue. Some people are clearly lacking imagination as they seem unable to see beyond their 21st-century Christianized perspective. Nudity was no big deal to our heathen ancestors. Bawdiness was a large part of their humor, just as it is much of ours today. There are many bawdy jokes and riddles surviving in Old English. Human nature doesn't change that much. These elements of the movie are all perfectly accurate. This was a time and place where a king might retain a professional \\"fartist\\" in his mead-hall, who entertained the men with his skillful control of flatulence!!! Be glad the movie kept things as low-key and tame as it did!!!<br />Boasting was also a cultural practice that was taken very seriously, and public boasts about future accomplishments could be considered binding before the gods; failure to achieve them was shameful and required some kind of debt-payment (known as \\"scyld\\"). Beowulf's boastfulness should be seen within cultural context; it is actually highly ritualized, not simply the product of his own ego.<br />Someone complained of Angelina Jolie's accent that it wasn't \\"pre-Anglo-Saxon Old English\\". First, there is no such thing as \\"pre-Anglo-Saxon Old English\\"; Old English developed from the combined tongues of the Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians when they invaded the British Isles. Second, as far as I know, none of us living today was around to hear what an \\"Old English accent\\" actually sounded like, if there even was such a unified thing (unlikely, given the variety of accents spoken throughout England today). Third, the poem is set in Denmark, not England. And fourth, the character is not a member of any human society, she is a sea-troll. Who knows what a sea-troll's accent sounds like?<br />As for the storyline - the story of Beowulf was told orally long before it was written down and concretized in one form, so the license with the story seems quite appropriate to me, and a good way of updating the themes to resonate more with the complexities of our time.<br />And, humor and drama CAN coexist, people. It doesn't have to be one or the other. Above all, the tale is meant to entertain.not a member of any human society, she is a sea-troll. Who knows what a sea-troll's accent sounds like?

0446605409|5.0|I really enjoyed the character of John Corey.  Good old fashioned mystery along with some modern intrigue and pirate tales.  Demille is certainly a very talented writer.  My favorite Demille book is The Charm School, but this one is very solid.
B00000269M|4.0|Having released the best-selling-album-ever just five years before pushing this one out to the market was, already, a quite difficult milestone. However, \\"Bad\\" still delivers good music not to disappoint the true fans, even though it did disapointed the critics and the profane masses expecting a \\"Thriller v.2\\".<br /><br />If compared with \\"Thriller\\" this one would definitely look unfairly like a poor recording, but when listened as a standalone project (what it really is) you'll find quite a good R&B dance pop album, delivering quality, creativity and a several pop gems. Remarkable collaborations also helped to made this one an essential.<br /><br />Keeping in mind it was dated on 1987, you'll understand why this chap was used to be considered then the \\"king of pop\\" as it sounds far ahead from it's era... far so good that it even gave the enough reasons for the jealous to start the harassment that lead to Michael Jackson decline. It marks the beginning of the end of a legend, away from the music scenario.<br /><br />A personal masterpiece on Michael Jackson's career, carefully produced by Quincy Jones, who also deserves a special recognition on being the one who put \\"Off the Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Bad\\" and Michael Jackson himself on the place they are, even today, no matter the resentful: at the pop highest.<br /><br />For a full \\"Bad experience\\" customers and real fans might find interesting to get also a copy of the complementary movie, 'Moonwalker', which showcases a kindo story around the \\"Bad\\" songs (keeping also in mind that the imdb rating is 4.7/10 as of today...):<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000YGFGD6 Micheal Jackson - Moonwalker [Non-US Format, PAL, Region 2, Import]]]
6305558175|4.0|Actor/producer Richard Gere seems to have a habit of translating successful French films into vehicles for himself.  Some are successful, some are not (Intersection)--this film is probably one of his best.  Based on the film, \\"The Return of Martin Guerre\\", which was also made into a Broadway musical, the story is about an Civil war vet who returns home after many years and resurrects his romance with his wife (Foster) who suspects he may not be who he really is, since before the war their relationship was at a stalemate.  Also she was being courted by a long time suitor (Bill Pullman) who is warily suspicious of him being who he is.  In the interim though he attempts to re-build the broken town by persuading the townspeople to plant tobacco rather than cotton.  Of course, there is a plot reversal in the story which challenges his identity and integrity to the limit.  I won't go too much into detail on this point but Gere & Foster deliver graceful performances as the ill-fated couple and Bill Pullman etches more than a portrayal of a villain but a man who drawn to extremes in his quest for the love of Laurel (Foster).  This film was approriately released during Valentine's Day and if you're a romantic at heart--you will be entralled by this film. If you're cynic at heart, then stay away.  This film is a worthy translation of the celebrated French film.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|Everything about this CD is amazing. It brings back the good parts that metal has lost over the past few years. It has a head banging rhythm, and strong lyrics. And you can understand the lyrics not jus screaming. It's got everything from the full of hate fast song (the way of the fist) to the emotion sparking soft sound of the bleeding. If you loved classic Pantera this is a CD you should for sure buy.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|HBO has produced some interesting historical mini-series such as \\"Elizabeth-the first\\" with Helen Mirren & Jeremy Irons and they've not disappointed us with this adaptation of the Pulitzer prize winning book, \\"John Adams\\". Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney deserve all the awards they can get for their portrayals of John & Abigail Adams--these characters come off as human rather than card board cutouts.  Also excellent are Tom Wilkinson as the hedonistic Benjamin Franklin, Stephen Dillane as the enigmatic, conflicted Thomas Jefferson, Rufus Sewell as the conniving Alexander Hamilton and David Morse as George Washington.  I thought at first this would be a dry history lesson but how mistaken I was when the acting and direction pulled me in!!  Definitely recommended for all history buffs and lovers of fine drama.
B0010X745K|4.0|2007's \\"The Mist\\" is director Frank Darabont's third stab at a Stephen King story, after \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"The Green Mile.\\"<br /><br />THE STORY: A strange mist falls upon a Maine village wherein numerous townspeople hold up in a supermarket. Within the mist lurks strange insect-like creatures, big and small. Two groups slowly develop within the market: 1.) The sane group who just want to work together and survive and 2.) The increasingly-lunatic apocalypse mongers.<br /><br />Let me first address what doesn't work, and then we'll look at the film's many positives:<br /><br />WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The initial set-up of the story is fine until about the 35-minute mark when I started rolling my eyes at the character stereotypes and their unbelievable actions. For instance, Andre Braugher, who plays Thomas Jane's black neighbor, insists that Jane and a handful of others are cruelly joking with him about a tentacled creature that killed a grocery boy. The man is ridiculously paranoid of imagined slights and it's just not believable.<br /><br />Then there's the cliched self-righteous, hate-mongering, doomsday-obsessed \\"Christian\\" played by Marcia Gay Harden. I'm not saying people like this wacko don't exist (after all, Jesus plainly stated \\"There will be false prophets; you'll recognize them by their fruits\\"), it's just that she doesn't come off believable. She also lacks the charismatic flair necessary to convert half of the people to her lunatic fringe.<br /><br />These are just two examples; there are more cartooney stereotypes that tempted me to tune out, the worst being when the wacko group attempts to sacrifice a guy for their deliverance. The word that kept coming to my mind was \\"Dumb.\\" But I accepted this dumbness and persevered on the grounds that the people in the store are obviously a microcosm of American society, a melting pot of different beliefs and cultures. Hence, most of the people are TYPES rather than realistic individuals.<br /><br />Another negative is that a full 90-minutes of the 2-hour runtime takes place IN the supermarket (or adjoining pharmacy), which gives the film a confined vibe. Alhough this didn't bother me much it could wear out its welcome for some people. The good news is that the ending is truly worth the wait.<br /><br />WHAT WORKS: I was wondering what explanation would be given for the mist and the creatures. I figured the revelation would be another roll-your-eyes moment but they came up with a plausible explanation.<br /><br />Some have criticized that all the characters are unlikable, but this isn't true at all. For instance, Thomas Jane is a great protagonist. All hell's literally breaking loose but he keeps his head at all times. The only other film I've seen him in is \\"The Punisher.\\" He's just a great ultra-masculine leading man in the manner of Eastwood, Heston, Reynolds, Stallone, Bronson, Brando, etc.<br /><br />There are numerous other likable characters like the beautiful Laurie Holden who plays the schoolteacher Amanda. She becomes Jane's companion-in-place-of-his-wife and substitute mother to his son. Amanda is truly spiritual, full of love, mercy and compassion. She's the antithesis of the Pharisaical Mrs. Carmody (Gay Harden). For instance, Carmody goes on and on with her religious blather and Amanda simply responds, \\"You're too Old Testament.\\"<br /><br />Amanda wouldn't say this unless she was familiar with the differences between the Old and New Testaments. This would indicate that she's likely a Christian of some sort, which is substantiated by her truly loving spirit (not that non-Christians can't be loving, so don't get me wrong; just that agape love is the core fruit of the Christian faith, which is why Jesus taught that false prophets can be plainly recognized by their lack of this fruit ~ Matthew 7:15-23. Agape love is one-and-the-same as the \\"fruit of the spirit\\" detailed in Galations 5). Why do I point this out? Because it's tempting for Christians to writeoff \\"The Mist\\" due to the character of Mrs. Carmody, who doesn't paint Christianity in a very positive light, to say the least.<br /><br />But, again, Jesus said there would be people like this, and there ARE. They're counterfeits. Notice during Mrs. Carmody's solo prayer in the bathroom where she essentially boasts of herself to God, a definite Pharisaical trait. Amanda then enters the restroom, full of love and understanding. Carmody responds with venomous, horribly insulting words, a clear indication that she's not truly what she claims to be.<br /><br />I'm a Christian and am therefore in contact with believers all the time and I can honestly tell you that the majority of Christians don't even remotely resemble Mrs. Carmody. Most Christians in my social circles sincerely walk in love and try to serve God even while they're flawed human beings who have weaknesses and make mistakes. And, yet, there are some hateful legalistic zealots like Mrs. Carmody. One woman I know insists on being addressed as \\"Apostle Harris\\" at all times, even though she's not an apostle in the remotest sense. She's got to be one of the most joyless, unkind, hostile people I've ever met (she once \\"rebuked\\" me for not praying over a cupcake!!!), yet she masquerades as a supposed Christian leader. Nothing could be further from the truth. She's false, pure and simple.<br /><br />As noted above, the story starts to feel overly confined due to the one-dimensional setting, but the climax is truly worth the wait [NO SPOILERS]. At about the 1 hour and 45 minute mark the film takes on a truly mysterious and awe-inspiring vibe as a handful of people escape into the forboding mist. The score at this point becomes equal parts ominous, beautiful and otherworldly.<br /><br />The potent ending is controversial. Some hate it but it makes a powerful point: Never give up hope because you never know how close you are to the dawn.<br /><br />FINAL ANALYSIS: I highly recommend seeing \\"The Mist.\\" Even though it recalls other mystery/horror films like \\"Night of the Living Dead,\\" and \\"Aliens,\\" not to mention \\"The Fog\\" and \\"Messiah of Evil,\\" it possesses its own uniqueness. Yes, some of the characters and characterizations are cartooney and contrived, but -- again -- the characters are meant to be a microcosm of multicultural society. Besides the ending is incredible (even if you oppose one certain aspect) and the story truly is thought-provoking. It successfully provokes the viewer to ponder long afterwards. My wife and I had a nice long discussion on the various social/religious issues and other points. This is a sign of a very worthwhile picture despite its obvious dumb elements.<br /><br />GRADE: Borderline B+ or A-Christianity in a very positive light, to say the least.

1400064287|4.0|The cover made this book seem like it would be dynamic, fun and engaging to read. I did not find that to be the case, so I never made it clear through the book. The content was interesting once I got through it. I think the reason I had a hard time with the reading was that the authors didn't move through the content in a concise way. Topics felt a bit drawn out. Still, the fundamental ideas here are valuable and worth knowing.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Stargate Continuum is an enjoyable movie. I enjoyed it more than many other Theater Release films. The cast is as usual superb. Seeing Don Davis teared me up a bit. I hope they do more of them.
B0016NF06O|4.0|I really enjoyed this album as fan of Mr. Nelson and Mr. Marsalis. I love hearing standards and blues sung with a worldly, honest, textured voice like Mr. Nelson's . Mr. Marsalis and his group bring all of the blues language including that of the jazz tradition to these songs. It is a great contrast with Mr. Nelson's straight forward blues guitar and voice. Mickey Raphael, Mr. Nelson's long time harmonica player adds to this album by bringing his trademark licks to the session. Needless to say Willie Nelson sounds like himself and Wynton Marsalis like himself--AND together they sound great!
B0010V4TZU|4.0|This cd is Awesome. I loved it from start to finish...Its indie rock that I'd listen to over and over again. A punk is an awesome song!!! It is a good  buy and I'm glad it was recommended to me. I can't wait to listen to their next album. I want more Vampire Weekend as soon as possible. I can't get enough of them...These songs make u get up and dance dance dance!! So yeah its a good thing I value my own opinion about music and take consideration on what others tell me theirs is. If anyone gets this album I don't think u will be disappointed. Don't take my word for it list your self!!
B000053VAZ|5.0|This is a ten star movie.  Johnny Depp is amazing leaving you wanting more.
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I love to read over all the other reviews to see what other people are saying before I write my own review. This can take a while because I sometimes get sidetracked and start clicking on the reviewers pages, to see what other books they liked if I agreed with what they said.  In this case, I was looking up all the reviewers pages who DIDN'T like this book because I'm like, if they didn't like this book, what the heck do they like? What would rate 5 stars in their opinions? (I wasn't impressed with the answer by the way)  Anyway, I sometimes get the feeling that peoples expectations are just way too high.  I know that different people have different types of humor and you can't please everyone. But to me, David Sedaris just covers so much ground that the rest of us have to tread too. I mean, even if you can't laugh at it surely you can relate?  I have read all his books and he just makes me laugh so hard. To be perfectly honest here, I was originally going to say that this was not his best book and recommend Me Talk Pretty One Day or (why can't I think of the name of the one before that, which was my favorite?).  But these other reviewers got me thinking. How much should a person really expect from a book? Should it hold the secrets to the universe? Should it have you rolling on the floor? Should it change your life? How much can one book do, really? Even the bible, for all its greatness, has some pretty dull moments. When I am reading a book, or watching a movie even, as long as I am engaged and entertained for that period of time I am pretty happy. If I'm bored or can't sit through it thats a different story, and that happens. But in a book like this if it keeps you reading while making you think a little,  smile a lot, and laugh out loud a few times, what more do you want? It does this and its definitely worth the five stars.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Continuum works a timeline/time-travel plot which is very similar to that of Moebius (from the eighth season on TV). All's well that ends well - or so it seems. Can we be sure that we are back in the \\"correct\\" timeline in each of these SG-1 stories? The fish situation in O'Neill's pond (comparing Moebius vs. Threads) was treated none too subtly, for one thing.     While we awaited its release, the hype surrounding Continuum seemed to imply that individuals were disappearing at Ba'al's \\"execution\\" as a result of a change in a timeline such that they were not meant to exist in it.  Hasn't that hokey plotline been done before, and would the Stargate writers really do that to us?  At any rate, look who vanishes first.  And check out that special \\"knowing\\" look on Ba'al's face at the second disappearance.  Clearly there is a plan afoot.    Isn't one timeline - however it may branch off from another - just as valid as any other timeline?  The \\"alternate\\" Landry most adamantly addresses this idea to the SG-1 team who had somehow jumped into his timeline and is trying to \\"fix\\" things.  Further viewings bring more thinking on the matter.  Stargate consistently does that, ya think?  I so love this series for that, and one could not ask for better actors to move it along.    The writers are always exercising their collective intelligence to the extreme, and they have given us a consistent series of episodes over the years - filled with character development, irreverance, team spirit and reasonably good science.  Let's have one more movie that takes its time in these matters and allows the characters to enjoy each other more. And enough with alternate timelines and time travel already. That's been done to death.  Let O'Neill SO kick some Tokra butt, and have him and Carter finally get it on in the \\"official\\" timeline and retire to an ascended state, or at least the state of Minnesota. \\"Fly Away\\" by Bread would make a perfect ending song.

I use this book as reference one, when I need to develop something, first read related chapters of this book and then write code.    Only one drawback, there are few code. Wil be better to have more code examples related with some topics.

0553582038|3.0|Yeah George, I know; writing is really hard to do well. And I am a huge fan. I mostly only review books that I liked. I LOVED the first three. I read this and it didn't give me that feeling of satisfaction that I get from a really good feast.  I'm trying to figure out how this one advanced the story. Maybe these were set ups for later stuff? Who knows? WHEN \\"A Dance With Dragons\\" comes out, I have faith that it will be on par with, and maybe even better than the first three. But where does that leave the \\"Feast\\". Let's face it, if your read the first three and then read the fifth (WHEN it's out), you have to read the fourth, just to know what was in it. It did have its moments. After all, the author is one of the greatest writers in the world.  Even Shakespeare probably wrote something that wasn't as good as everything else he wrote. Ummmm... I am trying to be supportive of the author here, because I really want to read the next book. That is, whenever he feels that it is READY to be shared.  I hope it is not another feast for crows.
B00004Z459|5.0|I am not among the many people that pretend to be cool and hate the popular bands. I just listen to whatever sounds good in my opinion. Linkin Park is a band that I love and can't get enough of. Hybrid Theory offers a great mix of rap and metal that gives a great harmonic sound.    Unlike other bands that have mixed rap and metal(Limp Bizkit), this music is not about stupid things like nookie. The songs generally talk about our complicated lives that we all live every day. Songs like \\"I'm about to Break\\" focus on the fact that life is hard. Most of their songs focus on that.    I will go as far as saying that there is not one bad song on here. If you are the type of person that feels stressed out a lot, this is the CD for you. Linkin Park gives us one of my favorite CDs.
0739366416|5.0|Senator Obama makes a compelling case for positive change.  He builds his reasoned case from history, bringing in his personal experience and beliefs.  I recommend especially the CD version of this book as you can hear the Senator's voice, so it is much like an extended, compelling speech.  He covers several critical topics, providing recommended policy changes for each.  To anyone interested in the potential that an Obama administration would have for America, please listen to or read what the Senator has to say.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The only reason I rented this movie was because I loved the music on the trailer I watched.   Wow. Words really can't describe all the emotions this movie made me feel, ansd I think it may be the only film that has made me feel this way. I loved the story, character, tthe way it was filmed, and oh my god the symbolism! I think that if you had 10 diffrent people sit down at the same time and asked them some questions, you could have ten siffrent opinions, and maybe even what the people thought the movie reprsenrs. This is now one of my favorite films, the greatest part for me is the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack, that has entered my soul, and can make me weep. Please, watch this film, and decide for yourself. You may be really glad you did.
B000HBK1RE|5.0|Pop music comes and goes. This is pop music at its best. This collection is a compilation of Delta's first 2 albums. It includes all the hits, plus a rare Japan only single. The inserts are beautiful, and the music is great! Buy this today along with her new US released album.

B00003CX9E|3.0|I hardly think this is the best film ever made.  It's too gimmicky by half.  The script isn't all that wonderful and I feel the Rosebud thing was a disappointment.  It looks and feels like a magician show.  Money can't buy you love-but if it can get you 9 out of 10 things in life-that ain't bad.  Buy a dog.  They love unconditionally.  If you curious to see what all the hype is about or if you're studying film-then it's worth seeing.

B000TSIK14|5.0|Finally! A group from my youth has the guts to just do their thing and release the music they became famous for. No big changes here. No need to \\"fit in\\" with whatever the latest musical fad is. You wont find any \\"screamo\\" or \\"hybrid hip hop\\" here. Its Scorpions through and through and I listen to this CD almost daily. The entire album is great and one that I can sit through without getting impatient and flipping to a song I want to hear more.<br /><br />I think 80s metal fans around the world are starving to hear all their favorite bands playing music in the style that made them all the metal gods we saw them as. The Scorps deliver with Humanity Hour 1.<br /><br />Its all solid classic Scorpions and worth every penny. Keep rockin fellas!
0684135051|4.0|This is a book every knitter, beginner or advanced, should have in her/his knitting library.  I'm sorry I didn't have it years ago, but even as an advanced knitter, when I bought this book I sat down, read it cover to cover, and penciled in my own notes in the nice wide margins put in the book for that purpose.  This allows the knitter to increase the use of this book with one's own additions or even comments on things that don't work for you.      One of the great hints she gives is on doing the brioche stitch.  She simplifies it beyond anything I have seen elsewhere.  I immediately did a child's cap following her advice and was very pleased with the outcome.     This book has very clear instructions on how to do various techniques and is something a knitter can return to over and over.  Priscilla Bouic
B000W4HFY8|1.0|This CD will be very disappointing if you are hoping for anything resembling the soundtracks from Season One or Fire Walk With Me. Lots of nondescript background jazz-snare.  I don't even care to use it for background ambience.
B00006D295|1.0|This review applies to both the 2000 and 2002 releases. It really infuriates me when soundtracks are altered, especially here, this being a musical (loose word there). I've seen both releases and they're the same. Take one of the early tunes, 'Over at the Frankenstein Place', it has an echo to it, making the music itself sound signifcantly different. I own the soundtrack and the VHS tape and they're the originals. I'm amazed that no one has commented on this before. So, if you want the original tracks, buy the VHS format.
B0006PV5U8|5.0|Puzzling thing with Prokofiev's two Violin Concertos, some fiddlers remain strongly associated with only one: Szigeti recorded only the 1st (twice), including I believe the premiere recording in 1937 with Beecham (it's been reissued by Naxos in their historical series with the fine coupling of Bloch's Violin Concerto, [[ASIN:B00009NJ1N Prokofiev: Violin Concerto Number 1]]), and Oistrakh, despite being so closely associated with Prokofiev, made only one recording of the 2nd (and no live recording has surfaced), whereas, besides his two studio recordings, a number of live recordings of the 1st have been published ([[ASIN:B0002VEPNU Prokofiev: Violin Concertos Nos. 1 & 2; Violin Sonata No. 2]]). The same applies to Milstein, who made two studio recordings of the 1st but recorded the 2nd only once, and relatively late, in 1965 ([[ASIN:B000A2H7R2 Profofiev: Violin Concertos 1 & 2; Violin Sonata No. 2]]). So far Mutter has recorded only the 1st - but with her that may not be the last word ([[ASIN:B000005E7Y Prokofiev: Violin Concerto No. 1; Sinfonia Concertante]]).<br /><br />On the other hand Heifetz, who made a historical premiere recording of the 2nd with Koussevitzky in 1937 and this stereo remake with Munch in 1959, never recorded (and, so far as I know, played) the first. Szeryng, Francescatti recorded only the 2nd, I think. Perlman also seems to favor the second (along with Sibelius' it was his first published recording, with Leinsdorf, in 1966, [[ASIN:B000003FDO Sergei Prokofiev:Sonatas for Violin/Concerto No. 2]]), although he did record the first, with Rojdestvenski ([[ASIN:B0000AF1KW Prokofiev Violin Concertos & Sonata for Two Violins]]).<br /><br />I don't hear anything in the compositions themselves that would justify this preference for one or the other. In fact, despite the near 20 years that separate their composition, I find them remarkably similar. But in the case of the 2nd, the wariness of some to tackle it no doubt had to do with the fact that Heifetz was there first.<br /><br />All amends made for the 78rmp sound, the 1937 version remains the classic (it comes on two CD reissues, on Biddulph and BMG, [[ASIN:B000009J15 Heifetz Plays Strauss (Violin Sonata op. 18), Sibelius (Violin Concerto), Prokofiev (Violin Concerto 2)]] and [[ASIN:B000003FIH Heifetz Collection, Volume 4 - 1935-1939]], alas both gone now). True, Heifetz' extra bite and lightness of bowing in 1959 with Munch scores in the sardonic finale. But in the firstmovement he is also more high-strung and plays with less abandon, and some of the nonchalant lyricism so endearing in 1937 is gone. In the slow movement, while his tone still has the crystal-like purity that has been so praised, I find that it is also less radiant and ample than in 1937 (something I remarked with his make and remake of Strauss' Violin and Piano Sonata as well, see my review of the above-mentioned Biddulph CD). Something else is also all but gone, in keeping with the tastes of the days: all those miniscule portamentos which in 1937 gave Heifetz' tone a unique vocal quality, especially in the second movement. He played as a soprano in those days would have sung - but in 1959, sopranos didn't sing the same. I personnaly love (and regret) the discreet sentimentality of it - given that Heifetz' is overall an unsentimental approach. Don't get me wrong, though: the 1959 version remains a glorious one with very little peers, and on this SACD reissue, the sonics are stupendous; the Boston Symphony is a pleasure to hear, with silky strings and every orchestral detail coming through - too much so at times even, with the woodwinds and even triangle (try 1st movement at 2:43) given an artificially close presence. Munch leads them with great dynamism and bite.<br /><br />The same comments can apply to Sibelius' Violin Concerto. Heifetz' conception in 1959 with the Chicago Symphony and Walter Hendl is remarkably similar to what it was in 1935 with Beecham (another recording premiere, and thesame Biddulph CD as above), but as in Prokofiev, Heifetz in 1959 has become even more radical, and in this case I find that it is the later recording that has the edge. Heifetz' crystal-sharp purity of tone is even more luminous now than in 1935. Again in all three movements the tempos are unrelentingly forward moving, with now an added forward dash: just compare Heifetz' first movement, 14:08 in 1935, 13:32 in 1959, to Hilary Hahn's 17:10 ([[ASIN:B0011WMWUW Schoenberg Violin Concerto Op.36/Sibelius Violin Concerto Op.47]]). His technique sounds also even more assured, in particular in the double stops of the first movement cadenza (there are passages though which, in 1959 as in 1935, he plays very awkwardly, such as the arpeggios in the short solo in the first movement at 1:40). Witness also the finale, in which so many fiddlers' bows sound sticky: here in 1959 one feels that, even more than in 1935, Heifetz has made a point of pride to countenance no hindrance (although truth is that compared to Hahn there are spots where you hear that he's dangerously walking on the edge). But for all that unrelenting forward drive, there is no loss of lyricism that I can perceive. On the contrary, I find it all the more intense and searing that it doesn't linger and fuss over the phrases (which is something Hahn, with many others, does in spots). Walter Hendl may not have left a name among the great conductors of the last century, yet I find the CSO under his baton no less admirable than the London Phil under Beecham's - and I hear much, much more of it. Heifetz' way with Sibelius certainly doesn't exclude other, broader approaches (especially in the middle movement, which can take a greater sense of space), but it remains a classic of its own.<br /><br />Glazunov's lush and sentimental romantic concerto - to my ears it even sounds in many spots like salon-music over-inflated to concert size - was particularly suited to a fiddler whose notion of modern music seemed to stop at the concertos of Korngold, Rosza, Walton and Gruenberg (I'm being unfair of course: other than Prokofiev's Concerto, Heifetz championed the sonatas of Ernest Bloch also, and those are as tough works as Bartok's Sonatas). As with Sibelius and Prokofiev, Heifetz had made, I believe, the premiere recording of Glazunov's, with Barbirolli and the London Philharmonic in 1934 ([[ASIN:B000I2ISMW Sibelius/Glazunov/Tchaikovsky: Violin Concertos - Jascha Heifetz, Sir John Barbirolli, Sir Thomas Beecham, London Philharmonic Orchestra]]). Dating from 1963, this stereo remake is, for him, a late recording, and in fact it is, if I am not mistaken, his last recording of a concerto, so it nicely completes the circle of his recording career. I haven't heard the earlier recording to know if, as with Sibelius and Prokofiev, Heifetz, far from mellowing with age, now played it with even more urgency. There have been indeed, from Oistrakh to Vengerov, more expansive, not to say sentimental approaches to the opening section, but in fact Heifetz is spot on Glazunov's metronome tempo, and likewise in the ensuing, more animato passage at 0:45. His tone in 1963 is typically pinched and slightly wiry on the low strings, without the lush blossoming sound of an Oistrakh, but very luminous in the higher reaches. Not even Heifetz can turn Glazunov's concerto into great music of the stature of Sibelius', but in fact I think the very urgency and leanness of his approach, the refusal to linger (and the observance of Glazunov's metronome marks), does the piece good: one doesn't need to pour out the sentimentality, there is already enough of it in the music as it is. And mind you, Heifetz isn't just all urgency, he is quite expansive - as expansive as Vengerov in fact - in the quasi slow movement of track 8, and his reading is also graced by his unique, inimitable and never emulated singing inflextions. Walter Hendl again and the RCA sonics offer great support, with every detail of whatever there is in Glazunov's orchestration coming out clearly, but not glaringly spotlighted either, and making this a true dialogue of two equal partners, not just an indistinct carpet of mushy sound for a vain virtuoso display. Why isn't Hendl more renowned?<br /><br />This disc is indispensable for containing two essential recordings of 20th Century Violin Concertos, and one masterful reading of a very minor one.erg (I'm being unfair of course: other than Prokofiev's Concerto, Heifetz championed the sonatas of Ernest Bloch also, and those are as tough works as Bartok's Sonatas).

B0012Q732O|3.0|Steven Strait dons animal skins and sets out to save the prophesied \\"child with blue eyes\\" (who happens to be his love interest) in Roland Emmerich's \\"10,000 B.C.\\"<br /><br />While it's enjoyable enough to watch, \\"B.C.\\" just doesn't feel like the grand epic it should be.  It has all the necessary ingredients to be an epic:  an unlikely hero, a beautiful damsel (and tribe) in distress, a menacing enemy with seemingly supernatural powers, an angry god/ruler and gigantic roadblocks for the hero.  Despite having all of these components, though, it just doesn't click as an epic.<br /><br />Steven Strait's portrayal of the hero, D'leh, is sufficient, but I never felt that he truly took charge of the adventure.  Camilla Belle's role as the blue-eyed love interest has a ton of potential, but she's relegated to a lot of long looks (with emphasis on the eyes, of course) into valleys, fearful looks into the general direction of a god, and a couple of weak attempts at taking matters into her own hands.  The most interesting character of the lot was, to me, Nathanael Baring's portrayal of Baku.  The rest of the cast, though gamely played, never really interested me that much.<br /><br />Granted, the mammoths, giant birds and (somewhat fake-looking) sabertooth tiger were fun to watch and the final battle was nothing short of grand, but the overall feel of this film was ho-hum.<br /><br />As far as the DVD is concerned, the film looks wonderful.  The special features include some deleted scenes and an alternate ending that, in my opinion, works better than the one actually used in the film.<br /><br />Would I recommend it as a purchase?  Probably not.  While it's an okay film, there's just nothing about it that makes it very special.  If it comes on television, be sure to watch it unless there's a football game on or one of Emmerich's other films.<br /><br />When you boil down to it, \\"10,000 B.C.\\" is a popcorn-friendly flick with no pop at all.
0385340567|1.0|I love Jack Reacher, wandering former military policeman, and he is at his best when the scrapes he falls into come naturally, the sort of adventures that might happen to a certain type of tough character who is wandering in America.<br /><br />In this book, he stumbles across a mess in Colorado.  As he cleans this up, he discovers a secret war between the U.S. and Iran.  He discovers an escape railroad for deserting U.S. soldiers stressed out by multiple tours in Iraq.  He discovers that battle tanks of the United States are being destroyed in these wars, and that the U.S. is covering this up.<br /><br />He discovers that the U.S. is transporting destroyed tanks and jihadi cars all the way to Colorado, to chop them up.  But the oversight on this operation is a bit lax, so a crazed religious zealot operating the salvage yard is sequestering the Uranium from the battle tanks to create a dirty bomb, set it off in the Middle East, and bring about the Rapture.<br /><br />So Reacher saves the world.  And in the most boring way possible, with multiple lame slow trips between the two towns of Hope and Despair.<br /><br />I do not mind the sudden politicization of Jack Reacher... except that it is poorly executed, and therefore the writing does not sing.  Wandering has made him a standard empty headed liberal, which is fine, but how entertaining is that?  What I mind is the transformation of one of the most gritty and well-written characters in adventure fiction into a cartoon hero who beats up six men without a scratch, who solves multiple complex mysteries with aplomb, and who is a bit preachy in his laconic and understated way.<br /><br />If there was a Jack Reacher, and he behaved like this, someone would hit him in the head with a bar stool while he was busy being full of himself.
B00005JLKB|4.0|Even those of us who don't read comics know the story of Superman.  But what was life like growing up for him?  That's the focus of this series.  And it is surprisingly addictive.<br /><br />Set in modern times, we join Clark Kent (Tom Welling) is Smallville, Kansas.  He's a teenager attending high school.  And he's just starting to develop the powers he'll use to save the world as Superman.  His best friends in school are Pete Ross (Sam Jones III) and news hound Chloe Sullivan (Allison Mack).  And he is not so secretly in love with girl next door (okay, a mile away.  It is the country) Lana Lang (Kristin Kreuk).  Unfortunately, she's already dating quarterback Whitney Fordman (Eric Johnson).<br /><br />In addition to being a farming town, Smallville has a LuthorCorp fertilizer plant.  Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) has just been sent there by his father Lionel (recurring actor John Glover).  And when Lex hits Clark but both survive, the two form a friendship, much to the dismay of Clark's parents, Martha and Jonathan (Annette O'Toole and John Schneider).<br /><br />But weird things keep happening in Smallville.  Seems that the meteor shower in which Clark arrived 13 years ago left behind all kinds of rocks.  And coming in contact with them gives people strange powers.  With Chloe's help, Clark has to keep trying to save the day while forging a friendship with Lana.  All this leads up to a season ending cliffhanger sure to have you coming back for more.<br /><br />I'm just now watching this series.  The first few episodes were actually rather forgettable.  I was already getting tired of the formula of the show.  But then around episode 8 or 9, the show began to find itself.  True, it often still focused on the freak of the week, but they started telling the story in different ways and involving more of the cast.  I especially got hooked on Whitney's storyline in the second half of the season.<br /><br />And you can't forget the special effects.  Even when I was bored with the story, I was still impressed with just how great they looked, especially for a weekly television series.  The acting was a little weak near the beginning, but it got better as it progressed as well.<br /><br />What really got me the most was watching the friendships of the characters.  It breaks my heart that Lex and Clark grow up (okay, so Lex is already an adult) to be enemies.<br /><br />And the show constantly throws in ironic lines about who Clark will become.  These jokes always make me laugh.<br /><br />I've added another TV show to my list of shows to watch.  Just what I needed.  Give the show a chance to get over its slow start and you just might be hooked as well.with just how great they looked, especially for a weekly television series.

0385340567|1.0|I am a serious \\"Reacher\\" fan and I've read all the other books.  Up until this point I would automatically pre-order the newest edition, but never again.  After reading \\"Nothing to Lose\\", I felt totally ripped off.  I wanted to take this book back and demand a refund.  I wish that I had looked at these reviews before buying this book.  I will not even check one out again from the library until I have read the Amazon reviews first.  Lee Child totally slaughtered the Reacher character in this book to the point that I don't think I can ever have any respect for him again.      This book is really an anti-military, anti-establishment, anti-war, anti-Christian, rant wrapped up in the guise of a Reacher novel.  After the first 30 pages it just felt wrong, and the more I read the more I felt that this book could not have been written by the same author.  Reacher who has certainly been proud of his military background up until this point, does an about-face and is now putting down all wars after WWII, encouraging military deserters, and bashing the establishment.  At the same time he is doing all of this he gives an \\"Honor, God, and Country\\" speech to a slack VA worker.  It is like Reacher's evil twin psychotic brother has come to life.      In order to bash everything that Child wanted to bash in this book, he had to create a very unbelievable story where you have an entire town under the total control of a crazy, rich, religious zealot who thinks he can bring about the rapture by blowing up an American city with the world's largest dirty bomb.  In this same town there is also a fraction of liberal anti-war types who are operating the world's largest under-ground railroad for military deserters to get them to Canada.  If this wasn't bad enough, Child has to make Reacher's side-kick in this story the wife of a critically wounded veteran who tried to get her husband to desert before he was blown up by a road-side bomb in Iraq.  It is just too much!!    Reacher spends his time having philosophical discussions, and walking back and forth into this weird town beating up guys and walking back out.  The millionaire religious fanatic who is building the world's largest dirty bomb can only come up with a couple of old guys with a wrench for security.   Reacher has no trouble beating them to a pulp without getting a scratch.  Sometimes he takes them on 6 at a time.  This is a Colorado town and nobody has a gun???  By the end of the book it is not surprising that this totally psychotic Reacher carefully checks the old guys he has just beat up to make sure they are OK then blows them to hell with their own dirty bomb.  He doesn't seem to care that radioactive debris is raining down on the nearby town, highway, and military post.   Give me a break!    The writing was so bad in this book, that I keep waiting to hear that it was really written by one of Child's assistants or that Child was recently diagnosed with a brain tumor.      Please skip this book or you will never be able to look at the Reacher character seriously again.  I hated to give this book a 1 star ratinng, but that was the lowest available.      Nothing to Lose, except this and many other readers.  Lee Child owes his fans an apology for this mess.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|To date, this is Megadeth's most musically advanced and progressive album.  It is definitely up for consideration as one of the heavy metal classics in their catalog, and for good reason.  Unlike other Megadeth albums, the non-remastered \\"Rust In Peace\\" sounds quite clear and punchy, dispensing with the drum-gating and massive use of effects that (thankfully) were starting to disappear around this time.  Clearly, the Mustaine/Ellefson/Friedman/Menza lineup is the most technically refined Megadeth lineup to this point.      Forget the AOR antics Megadeth would later fall prey to - this album is meant to be played from beginning to end.  Musically, it contains some of Megadeth's best moments, particularly on the relentless Holy Wars, which right away goes into a fast shred-fest with Menza's rifle-like drumming holding everything together perfectly.  The album from there takes you on a roller-coaster varying between an assault of impossibly fast and precise guitar playing and pure aggression  to grinding power-metal anthems like few other heavy metal records successfully manage to do.  It seems like on this record,  Megadeth get that combination just right.    This period marks sort of the beginning of a turning point for Megadeth between that of a pure thrash metal outfit to a more sophisticated and intricate sound.  It is reported that it was around this period that Mustaine kicked his drug habit.  Hearing the result, it's easy to believe.  While Mustaine still sounds angry and raw, he is also much more refined and sounds like he can approximate singing when he wishes to.  Lyrically, you won't find any of the adolescent antics that were all over So Far... So Good... So What in songs like \\"502\\" and \\"Liar!\\".  Megadeth has come of age.     If you have to have just one Megadeth album, in my opinion, this one is it.    Some people like to see track-by-track breakdowns.  For them, here you are:  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  The self-important rating system -   -----------------------------------------------------------------------  5 = Good enough to remove the record from the sleeve and onto the turntable  4 = Good enough to place the needle on this track if the record happens to be on the turntable already  3 = Respectable Filler  2 = Will lift the needle to the next track to skip this one.  1 = Time for a lively game of frisbee.    (rating)/bpm/key    1) Holy Wars(4)/174/E - A fast, pounding prog-thrash overture that immediately displays the incredible virtuoso musicianship of the Mustaine/Ellefson/Friedman/Menza lineup.    2) Hangar 18(5)/156/D - Immediately starts off with a straightforward metal beat.  Frontman Mustaine rarely has so perfectly straddled the line between the old angry Mustaine and the new singing Mustaine to create the needed edge to the song.  The 2nd half goes into a shred-fest with Friedman and Mustaine trading guitar solos.    3) Take No Prisoners(4)/288/G - Relentless call and response thrash - \\"Take no Prisoners.... Cremate them...\\" You can see the mosh-pit going out of control.  Unlike most thrash metal around this period, however, this band redefines precision.  The drums are recorded completely dry, and they sound like rifles in perfect unison with Ellefson's bass work.    4) Five Magics(4)/138/E - Starts off with a relatively slow dissonant riff that slowly builds momentum as the guitars kick in gradually.  Culminates in an evil sounding Mustaine with voice tripled chanting \\"Five Magics....\\"    5) Poison was the Cure(4)/138/A# - One of few songs that could have fit with the set on Peace Sells - fast and short at 2:55 - under scaling guitars and Mustaine's droning vocals.    6) Lucretia(4)/96/G - Slows it down to a Zeppelin style beat with guitars/bass scaling up and down.    7) Tornado of Souls(5)/192/ - Most straightforward track on the record - contains one of the more memorable Megadeth riffs and has a hook.    8) Dawn Patrol(3)/78/E - The only throwaway track on the album, sort of a plodding bass/drum track with Mustaine talking some incomprehensible rubbish over the top.  Really more of an interlude at 1:46.      9) Rust In Piece...Polaris(4)/162/F# - Starts out with a 3/4 grind and ends with a nimble and fast jam that shows off Menza's drumming prowess.

For my generation, after this film was released anytime you saw a large strange dog in the near distance, your mind raced with the thoughts of this film.<br /><br />While still pretty effective, this film about a mother and son trapped inside their broken down Ford Pinto while a rabies-infected Saint Bernard terrorizes them from the outside in, still has plenty of scares even 25 years later. While not as classic as other Horror films of it's time, it did forever become the grandaddy of all maniac dog movies. So on that level alone, it comes from me to any Horror fan very suggested.<br /><br />However, it does have a few faults. Even though it was shot and released in 1983, this movie looks and feels like it was actually done in say 1976, down to it's starring car and ABC-Movie Of The Week musical score. Another is the 30 minutes of set-up at it's beginning showing the trials and downfalls of suburban marriage and family life at the time. Not that those 30 minutes hurt the movie, it actually sets up the characters for concern quite nicely, but to new fans of the movie they might wonder what drama film got accidently put in this Horror DVD's case.<br /><br />But once Cujo gets things a foamin' about 40 minutes in, all Hell breaks loose and let the intense claustrophobia begin. As for extras, there's a nice 50 minute documentary called \\"Dog Days:The Making Of Cujo\\" from 2007 that has crew and actors telling about how things were done quite informatively. Seeing a now 30 year old Danny Pintauro talking about his role when he was just six is nice to see a former child actor who can still remember the work much less live to tell about it. Also a directors commentary & an anamorphic picture with a high bit-rate, this is a worthy addition to any classic Horror collection. Despite purists who say that it changed certain aspects for the film not originally in the King novel (all of which were approved by King), this is one film that will make most say \\"The movie was better than the book\\".<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.0/10)to any classic Horror collection.

B00009XITQ|5.0|Hello everyone.  I saw this movie first in TV in Iceland where I am born.  I saw it 2 times and really enjoy it.  I really want to buy it and what was the best place to look at.  Yes you are right.  Amazon.com  I search there and found it and order it right away.  I was so happy when I got it and I can watch it over and over again.    I like this story because it is so innocent, but so true and everyone live happily ever after.  Great story, good actors, lovely places where it is filmed.  Thanks. Rosa in Iceland.

I also enjoyed the idea that those of us who are more \\"right brain\\" than \\"left brain\\" thinkers have an excellent opportunity to be more valued in the coming years....     I liked this book so much that I have already bought and given away 10 copies and am ordering more.    Great job Mr. Pink  Toni Cordell
