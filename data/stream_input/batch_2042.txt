B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun to play, but sometimes a little buggy. I dont like that competitions take up so much energy though. Its good overall.
B003IWYOF4|5.0|Molly Ringwald, Emlio Estevez, Jud Nelson, Micheal Anthony Hall and Ally Sheedy put themselves on the map with this movie. Never gets old watching 5 teens spend D-hall together!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A Page turner never wanted to put the book down . A tragic tender life.  A great read you will enjoy.
B002L9N4DS|5.0|Tom Hanks does it again. This is one film that is a must in the collection. Bubba Gump shrimp..its a household name!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Was even better then what was told.<br />my kids love this movie great movie movie for the family on a Saturday night
B005LAZIRY|5.0|I absolutely love this album. It is by far Opeth's most progressive album yet. Plenty of jazz, blues and folk influence throughout the album!
1603429999|5.0|Being a new knitter this will be a great resource book. This will pay for itself in knitting workshop fees that I can avoid.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The original temple run was pretty cool, but temple run 2 is awesome! The graphics are soo much better and the people look more realistic. There are also zip lines and mines which are super cool. &quot;Tilt to live!&quot;
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Loving this game! Such a cute but challenging game! Wish there were more games like this!  Worth the 1.99 for the full version!!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Love this app. Have it on my iPhone and kindle. Use it to carry my book list ( avid reader) and acess and make immediate changes to my cheer paperwork (coach daughters cheer squad).
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is the best battery viewer out there it turns on as soon as you plug in your device, which you can control, thank you for a great app:o)
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This movie is fantastic and it came in a timely manner, in great condition and was a great price.  I was very happy with the purchase and the seller.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. There was always a twist that kept me wanting more. Very intriguing story. Need to know what happens next.
0312983867|5.0|It was brand new and came very fast.  I really liked the book and was glad that I got it.  I have always liked amazon and will continue using it.
B004HXIZVC|3.0|it is usually a pretty good app it just stopped working on my kindle fire. there is no way to reinstall it so I cant use
B004I9CXHW|5.0|Its a great product that works as described on my 2013 VW Passat sel TDI the only think that its not to great is that it doesn't let me play music from my android device only if I hook it up to Bluetooth. Otherwise it does What is supposed to do and I haven't tried a USB drive yet
030758836X|1.0|This book is way over sold and proves that most readers are not very demanding of an author .<br />I finished this book through mere persistence and cannot figure out why so many people are buying this story ...<br />My wife could not stand it after about 75 pages ! A big a waste of time and a real statement about a women' s mind ; where did this author come up with such a mentally sick character.<br /><br />SPOILER<br /><br />The ending third is so weak it is pathetic writing !<br /><br />The second half is predictable and who is ever going to believe the ex- boyfriend' s character !  No man would ever stay with such a person !
1439190275|5.0|I have lost over 10 pounds the first month and feel the best I have felt in many years---I have tried many diets, but this is a &#34;WAY OF EATING&#34; for life----
B005DOKL3E|3.0|This product is ok.  It does protect the Kindle.  However, I found another one that allows the Kindle to prop up.  I like that one much better.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Interesting read.  Ran through a roller coaster of emotions and felt sorry for Charlie.  Book was open ended and I still had some questions after I was done.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is the bomb diggity do u like horses cause I do and that's pretty much what makes this game the bomb Best diggity
B003VANOFY|4.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.<br /><br />The Headphones are great, I'm a gamer who has to have everything wireless since my desktop is hooked into my TV so running wires across my living room floor isn't really an option. The audio quality is great, I've been playing a lot of Planetside 2 and being able to actually \\"hear\\" an approaching enemy (when I'm not neck deep in enemy fire) is very nice, plus it tunes out everything keeping the whole experience very immersive. Having done self audio tests through windows and speaking to others I can vouch that the mic has great clarity and while I don't use voice masking it is a nice feature.<br /><br />Now the only gripe I have is that the software kind of sucks. Thats not to say it doesn't work but I've noticed times where switching from headphone to regular audio output through my TV the audio will simply cease to function and this is only solved via a reboot. Having read up on this, it seems this may be an issue with Windows 7 but its still something a would-be buyer should be aware of.<br /><br />Overall I recommend this to any gamer looking for a good comfortable headset, I have to take it off after a few hours just to let my ears \\"breath\\" but other than it pretty much always stays on my head.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse I do believe there is a Vanu base that needs assaulting.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Flynn writes another captivating novel of intrigue, this time with an aging Rapp.  His portrayal of Rapp makes it more difficult this time for the reader to identify with the protagonist because his present Rapp has become a bit mentally unballanced toward viciousness.  Still a good read.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Very helpful to have while &#34;on the road&#34;. Although not an all-inclusive guide for all sites/ attractions in a specific area, it's the best I've found.
B009MCRHH6|1.0|The whole process of getting the application to your phone and downloading it, was no fun. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love these type of games.  Very nice graphics and I enjoyed the story line.  Looking forward to more! Good job G5 keep up the good work! =)
0062200909|5.0|Love this book.  Got it for my 11 year old to read and look at while she is reading the book.  She is loving the book and I am having her read it before she sees the movie.  I did the same with all of the Harry Potter books.  This keeps her interested in reading great books!!
B001EOOQF6|5.0|Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi,and Geezer Butler occompanied by the heavy rhythms from the very underated drummer Vinny Appice show why they are considered the \\"godfathers\\" of heavy metal. I love Ozzy and he played an equally important role as a metal pioneer/founding member of Sabbath, but I believe that Dio-era Sabbath music is the absolute pinnacle. Mob Rules is superior to me because it's slightly heavier than Heaven and Hell and seems to better showcase the distinct vocal mastery of Ronnie James Dio. I have to admit that when I received my first copy of Mob Rules on cassette I was expecting more of a \\"traditional\\" Sabbath sound and it took a few years before I really appreciated the music.<br /><br />I was fortunate to have witnessed this lineup perform many of these songs live in 2007 about 26 years after the recording. Even though it would be close to the end of RJD's career...for me it was like living in a dream. It will always be one of the best concerts I've ever seen. RJD...you are missed and will forever be remembered for the musical legacy you left us...RIP.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Incredibly beautiful story about love and loss and pain and forgiveness. This story is incredibly raw and real. Holder captures your heart from the get go.
B008DL1DQI|5.0|This movie is so hilarious! Seen it several times and it never gets old. The characters are so well written.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|If you are into zombie movies or the undead then this series should be right down your alley.Myself i think it is one of the better series created
1611735947|4.0|Very humorous, entertaining,  well written. My father is enjoying it. He is 101, and it may give him ideas ...
B004UID2LC|4.0|I think Youtube is known well enough that it does not need my recommendation. And don't forget you can look on Youtube for things more along your own interest.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I love the tv series but I got behind and missed episodes and just wanted to read the books anyway. They are surprisingly good reads. Easy to get through and just a  fun book. I love that you get a further look into the characters thoughts as well. A little different from the show but I'm definitely hooked!!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|There are four dragons and each dragon has I believe at least 15 different numbers. It records the time it takes to solve them and some are getting more difficult. The one thing I do not like is all the time that same music. I think it is nice to have some music while playing because I tried completely muting the music, but I did not like that either. Since it saves the scores on your attempts you can see whether you improved playing a particular lay-out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game. Graphics are excellent and its entertaining. If you love horses I'd definitely recommend this! Good time passer too
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My husband is from India and I have always admired Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench. The young Indian entrepreneur is the one who played in the Indian version of Who Wants to be a Millionair. This British group of retirees travel as a group to India and of course, at first are quite overwhelmed by the drastic differences and some adapt better than others. One never does, divorces her husband and goes back to India while her husband relishes visiting all the old beautiful temples. The princely hotel is also not quite cut out to be what they had been told in England but the enthusiasm of trying to make a go of it of this young entrepreneur is quite charming and there are some cute mix-ups. Just enjoyable to watch.
B0099114WO|5.0|I ordered it for my mother. she was trying to find this movie. so i found it on line for her
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|If all you have available is your iPhone or other device it would be useful.  Otherwise it's much faster to use a mini caculator.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel is serious, thought provoking, with that British humor that I so love. I loved this movie and watch it over and over. It is long the line of Tea With Mussolini, Calendar Girls etc.  .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A great love story that had so many twist and turns I was unable to put it down. Had much more depth and plot than most romance novels I read. Was bummed when it was over !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game, It makes you feel like you really own a horse and are caring for it...I love caring and doing things for my horse...
B005IQZB14|4.0|My husband and I spent several summers doing 2-3 week backpacking trips in the Sierras back in the 90s.  This book really took me back to how hard those trips were, and yet how incredibly rewarding and fulfilling.  Cheryl went from a total novice to someone who knew her limits and what her necessities were.  Perhaps she might have been a bit more prepared if she had carried some cash on her person to deal with the supply boxes that did not arrive on time, but she pretty much nailed the feelings of comraderie and wonder that one feels while backpacking and meeting others who are on the same journey.  I really liked this book.
B006BXT4TI|5.0|Wasn't sure if I'd like these guys or not, but this was a great album and I can't stop listening!! That says a lot, coming from a Metal guy!!
B006L1TT8G|5.0|My daughter is quite satisfied with the purchase of this album and she hasn't stopped since it arrived.  I think I know this album word for word and could sing it through with out any mistakes.
1401235417|5.0|Absolutely amazing art and even better story. I recommend this to anyone interested in Batman, comic books or just good reads in general. Amazing book.
B008EEZ64Y|3.0|This book was a good, quick read.  The ending leaves you hanging with a lot of unanswered questions.  In order to understand all of the story, you must keep reading the series.  Read Gathering Blue, Messenger, and Son in order to fully understand the story.
B008TMA1LY|4.0|it was very cute, run your own cafe and serve customers. it is hard though you have to be fast
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It's great, it's great for reading without holding it. Makes it easier to find instead of the black case it is.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game has been very interesting and the puzzles keep you on your toes! I even jumped a few times through the storyline!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really thought the story was great.  Good explanations of religions.  But a couple of scenes were too over the top and I truly  disliked the ending.  It was like it stopped and I wanted more.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The multiple compelling storylines continue.  Extremely well-acted as well as superbly written.  It is one of the best dramas of its type I have scene.  Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book was amazing. It kept me interested and excited the entire time. I love how everything ended off and can't wait to see the movie if ever made.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Just got it last night and watched it on DVD. Awsome color and fantastic music. Great movie and Great CD.
B00991TCOG|5.0|At first I really did not like violin as much. That all changed after I heard Lindsey Stirling's Music. Even though her music is eloquent and beautiful, her persona really brought happiness to me. So, a thanks to Lindsey Stirling, she is amazing.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! It is so much fun and never leaves you bored. This new Temple Run 2 is a big step up from the first Temple Run. You get to do so much more and is so Much more fun! I highly recommend this app to ANYONE! Definitely get this app! [...]
1595828753|3.0|I like the idea that the comic book series is focusing on all the characters not only one. For example in this one, it focuses more on Toph and Sokka.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it. Loved both characters. Eva and Gideon are some messed up people but they are perfect for one another. Can't wait for Reflected in you!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great for kids who have always dreamed of having a horse but couldn't because of money a d where you live. This game has competitions and just playing with your horse
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved Bared to You and loved Reflected in You more. Can't wait for Entwined in You coming in May!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow. That's the word I said over and over as I read \\"Gone Girl\\".  One moment you think you know what's going to happen and then you turn the page and the book slaps you in the face.  The book has a seemingly basic plot. Young couple in love ,get married, live in the big city, then lose their jobs and move to his hometown to take care of his ailing parents. The real story begins when the wife goes missing. Great book! I can't wait to read Gillian Flynn's other novels.
0545128285|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my favorite Harry Potter fan. She just loved it. It has become a favorite.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is for everyone. The realness of it all is just cool. And I like that it comes with great playing rewards.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|With the backdoor in acrylic and a smooth automatic operation it's an amazing watch.<br />Two languages for week days are possible with all mechanical movement.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This  game I  SOOOOOOOOOO much fun! Both me,  my three little brothers, my older brother, and older sister play it all the time. I want my kindle back!
B000062V9C|1.0|I got this so excited and I put it in the DVD player and nothing just a message.  I could not use it because it was for only the UK.  Who would have ever thought that at all.  The seller however was awesome they took it back no question and I got a refund.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|So addicted to this game. Great fun . Always thinking,never bored. A must get!  Super fun game. NEVER want to put down.
1591396190|5.0|My peers and management recommend this book and actually are very big on this concept.  It is as expected and was fine!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I started reading this book and in the beginning, I was really frustrated by it. It just seemed like some overtly dramatic, angst teen romance novel with thin intensity. It didn't seem real. Then I hit about 60%...and I couldn't put it down. The entire story as you think you know it completely implodes on itself and teenagers in this painfully connected Ted light that makes the end of this book a swig pageturner. It ended up being very far from the conventional teenage love story. Although I still don't know that I absolutely loved this book, it did surprise me and it did offer a good twisted spin.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is an amazing horse game! It is very realistic and you can do so many things with your horse. I suggest getting My Horse if you love horses.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I chose this book to read because I saw that it was coming to the movie theaters February. It was all I expected and more.  I can't wait to go see it. Thanks Nicholas Sparks for another great book.
0307744434|5.0|what an imagination, i couldnt put it down.  to write a story about magic and keep her characters so inline makes this book totally different than anything ive ever read. to tell it would spoil it, so enjoy!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|When I get on this apparently it takes about 1 to 2 mimeuets to load if you fix this it will be 5*****
B005VGUA5S|5.0|From the broken doll version of &#34;Que Sera, Sera&#34; to the funky song about a Man in Sombrero, this is my favorite music, favorite performances, and favorite musical enjoyment of all time!
B003V5K0AQ|2.0|My five year liked it but I didn't. It was very strange but I guess that's what I expect from a Tim Burton movie.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Now the tablets my kids are so attached to, can wake them up in the morning! lol. They have been wanting their own alarm clocks actually, and this does the trick. Works as it should. There should be a volume control on the app though,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty good,though it is a little hard to understand.You also get to buy unicorns instead of just horses.
B004GVUPFE|4.0|This game is a pretty good challenge. Its more for adults and older children. My oldest enjoys it, but younger kids are just confused. Great game for ten and up.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|So I downloaded the game on my kindle today thinking it would bd say better than it is on my phone and I played it once and now wont let me back into the app and wont let me redownload it after I deleted it (thinking that would help)
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great graphics! The kids love this game. It seems to be very intuitive. It's really well done. Good job gameloft.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|This wonderful series is compromised here.  They list the fourth episode ( in fact them all ) on the wrong dates.  In fact, it is the third episode from 20 Jan, not as stated and sold here.  I contacted the Digital division and all went very well, but nothing in fact changed.  FAIL.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Now I have an 80s arcade in the palm of my hand. Pretty cool if you ask me. Good game.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I loved this movie. I was pleasantly surprised with how funny it was. The humor is witty at times and completely corny at others. The songs are well done and Anna Kendrick's version of the \\"Cups\\" song blew me away. Fat Amy was a shining star for me.
B008C20TDG|5.0|I am finishing up my first Whole30 and read this book along the way.  Amazing science behind the program.  A must read for those that want to improve their health.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|The track are wery well selected for listening for an extended period of time. Unlike some other CDs of the singer, this album is not recorded with a single style in mind. Highly recommended.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|My only complaint is that I have to mount the Kindle with the camera on the bottom if I want to be able to charge the device with the lid closed.  Other than that, I'm pleased.
B000002KHF|2.0|The tracks are hardly distinguishable, same style, same melodies. After two or three tracks it is becomeing boring...forgettable. Whilst Morrison is one of my favorite singers, this album is not - put it mildly - his best
B0062KJ198|2.0|Besides a couple of original one liners this just isn't a funny movie.<br /><br />It's really too bad as the plot itself is actually decent for a comedy but after that it falls flat.<br /><br />Is it worth watching?  If you have nothing else to do it is, but don't expect to roll out of your recliner laughing at this one.
B009I2UH2W|4.0|This is a great charger, but I have to admit it didn't work the first day I tried to use it in my land rover. Maybe I didn't insert it in the lighter socket the right way, I didn't get a charge. I tried it again the next day and it worked.
B004HD61KE|4.0|A highly engaging read from start to finish. Very informative and disturbing truth about American history brought to the forefront with the Rollin's stylish flare. You finally gain a little more insight to who the guild really are and the scope of their influence . I would recommend this novel to anyone who likes the action, thriller, suspense genre or authors such as, Ludlum, Cussler, Koontz, Clancy etc.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|It's Indiana Jones, on blu ray. What else do you need to say?! My 8-yr-old likes the pictures inside the case.
B001JIFYSA|5.0|Love actually is a touching, romantic film that shows how interconnected we all really are.  Though it is a December holiday movie it's message set in a fun lighthearted tone is clearly one that can be learned any time of the year.
B009738XXM|5.0|My six-year-old can't get enough of Tiny Little Bows. And after a summer of non-stop Call Me Maybe, we're still not sick of it!
B003Y8YXGM|5.0|He was one of a kind and so is his art and music! This album is great like everything from John! His voice is so unique. His music so touching and sometimes haunting. His drawings just add to the value of his album
0385535147|5.0|I had a great time reading this book. Grisham is the best - no question about it. Can't wait for his next one.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I ABSOLUTLETLY LOVE THIS GROUP, and I am not a teeny bopper or groupies, I am a 47 year old Professional who has an ear for talent and these boys have it wrapped up and tied with a bow!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I am very happy with this app. There are many sounds to choose from and you can layer them. It works while your kindle is closed so you won't be annoyed by the light from the screen. I use it every night. I turn off everything else and sleep to these sounds. There are not obvious loops with clipping so it seems seamless. You can use it as a sleep aid or for meditation purposes.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I consider myself a well rounded book reader, and enjoy all types of books. I usally try and read whats popular at the time, but this book was just terrible. I knew it was all going to be about sex going in, but the sex scenes got a little old after a while and I was so disapointed in the female lead character. I could not believe how much she does whatever he said all the time and how many readers thought it was ok, and even hott. I was disgusted that women ( or worse teen girls) would think this type of relationship between Christian and Anastasia was normal. It sets a terrible tone for anyone reading it. I usually can just read a book and not take it too seriously, but I could not make myself finish this book as it was just too disturbing on so many levels.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|First of all, fantastic imagery and styles. something that really bothers me though, especially as I move to harder puzzles with smaller pieces, is that I can't see the piece when I pick it up because my finger covers almost all of it. viewing it on the side panel would be fine except you never know how big the piece is until you pick it up. it may grow to 5x the size or not even twice the size. also, some of the different styles have really annoying sound effects, especially since you hear it every time you place a piece. I like to hear sound when I play a game, it just needs to be less obnoxious.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|Although I adore the movie and saw it three times in theaters, I was a little disappointed at some of the songs left off of the highlights soundtrack.  Although the songs selected sound fantastic I would have liked to Look Down (The Beggers) and one or two other songs.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is the best game ever. It is ten times better than the first temple run and I love the first temple run. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!! LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!! BEST GAME EVER! !!!!!!!!!!
B008MEM24S|5.0|My three year old nephew adores this game.  Although he isn't quite able to solve the higher levels, he finds the lower levels entertaining and loves when he saves Perry.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This game makes me want to throw my kindle on the ground. For me the save me button just shut down the game and have to restart all over again.
B0086HGW42|5.0|A friend recommended Ed Sheeran to me and she could not have been more correct.  This album is certainly worth every penny!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I was so into this book in the first few pages!!! Wow what a story! I loved it and all the emotions I went through while reading it!!!
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|It says camera stopped every time I hit video record which is th  sole reason I brought it don't waste money or time
0394806220|5.0|Our son was obsessed with the little board book version so we got him this...it's great! Some sounds were a little challenging so it will make you giggle right along with your child. Enjoy this fun classic!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The original temple run was cool. I have never played the brave version, but it looks cool. TR2 has sent imangi home!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a great book and a great price for the hard cover. You get exactly what you would expect.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Hilarious! Seaon six was just as good as the other 5 the stories keep getting funnier every week. Can't wait for season 7.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think that this game is awesome but there is one thing that I don't like and that is I can never get it to open up when I want to play it but otherwise. it is an awesome game through and through.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Havnt played it for that long but I'm already hooked.  Love the competitions the most can't wait to play some more.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2.  It is very fun and addictive. It it better than the first one. There is more stuff. Like objectives, and more stuff to ovoide.I would get this app if toy enjoy temple run.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a great app. I want my 3 gems tho. its fun and I highly reccomend it. it graphics are GREAT!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a good game and worth thetime to play. graphics are awesome and very realistic and the updates are constant.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Kept me entertained for couple of hours. The game is really not to difficult. I wish they made the puzzles a bit more challanging.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I really like Angry Birds but this is another great strategy game. It lets you be totally creative, and still allows you to unlock things like Angry Birds.
014241543X|5.0|This should not be marketed as just a YA novel. Even though the main character is seventeen, and the book is suitable for teens, it is a wonderful examination of life and death that resonates with adults (like me). As she hovers between life and death after a major car accident, Mia flashes back to her life and her relationship with her parents, her best friend Kim, and her boyfriend Adam. Mia is funny, observant and seems very mature for seventeen (at least more mature than I remember being).<br /><br />Her parents are dead, she doesn't know the status of her beloved little brother, and her relationship with Adam is in question because she is very likely headed to NY to study at Julliard while Adam's rock band will keep him on the west coast. Will she choose to live? This book is beautifully written and the reader is torn between hoping Mia chooses to stay and understanding if she chooses to go . . .<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for readers of all ages (or at least 14 and up).
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's effort in 'Standing Ovation' lives up the wonderful standard exhibited in her previous CDs.  She has an absolutely marvellous voice and I am so glad she was discovered in Britain's Got Talent.<br />I was slightly disappointed with the start of &#34;Somewhere over the rainbow,&#34; with her departure from the usual.  However, it is starting to grow on me, the more I listen to it.

B007HXL1V0|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, as much as the authors' other book How to talk so kids will listen, and how to listen so kids will talk. A lot of good examples, step by step. Highly recommended.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|It is simply great to be able to watch all of these films in order and to see the artistic growth of the child performers  - just like watching Harry grow.<br />The veritable Whos Who of UK performers sashaying in and out of the series is just a bonus.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game so much its the best and I spend for ever on it on my way to see my real horse!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Love itt addictive and fun holiday special. Goals. Rewards great selections never bored. Try bakery story too. Much fun very  relaxing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Once you begin the story, it feels like it will be great. Once into it....so so. The ending is so so. Unusual ending. Rather chaotic story. Check the spelling you proofreaders! It is just ok, nothing that I immersed myself into reading.
B004F1F32A|4.0|This is an emotional ride and a film worth the viewing.  I was unable to turn away during the film.
B007SSDBBM|4.0|I'm a big fan of 18 and 19th century movies and history.<br />This movie is cute, and funny and all the actors played there characters well.<br />I would recommend this to anyone who is found of a sappy, love drama.<br />I would have to add that it needed a little more ending for me for the couple and what happened to her brother and ex boyfriend/neighbor.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|At first I was with the &#34;This is common sense&#34; people. I didn't need this. However, I realized what's wrong with a little validation!!  Maybe I Want this from a fellow creative! On certain points it seems like he's read my mind and it's soothing to hear that another creative thinks the same way I do. On another issue, an artist needs to know the difference between copying or interpreting, copying to learn and plain 'ol plagiarizing. Reading this again is refreshing and freeing if you keep those things in mind and it gives me motivation to create.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Frank Miller's classic inspired many of the best on-screen versions of the Dark Knight, it's about time it did more than inspire. This adaptation is terrific and faithful to the original.
B004Y042N8|4.0|It 's fun and challenging at the same time. Great game for brain games, especially when you need help and your memory has to get involved.
B00003CXA4|5.0|simply great.  watched the movie many times but never got bored.  inspiring great life story wotrh watching again and again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. My horse I so beautiful.She has the sweetest attitude.I love to feed her. She loves her food.

B001EBWITA|5.0|I base my review on how much I enjoy the movie, not what critics think. I loved it! Great effects, griping story line and not like a million other movies out there.
B009X012XM|1.0|This case would be great if I was left- handed. Mine opens the wrong way! I really would like to send it back.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is a fun game including riding in a bin, through the tunnel, swinging on a rope, and  running up and down a ridged mountain. This game is great for kids, teens, and adults. Beware though I find it very addicting!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought that the game was good and when I was playing I realized that the horse looks real u foul take epics and share them on facebook
1400069289|2.0|I have quite a bit of experience with the non-fiction genre since it is one of my favorite. I've gone through most of the well-known must-have like Glawell's books, freakonomics, switch, the wisdom of crowd and many others. I did not think this book was up to the same standard as other best-sellers of this kind.<br /><br />The examples in this book aren't either very fresh nor are they informative about the techniques you should use to improve your understanding of how habits work and why attempts at changing fail. Instead of giving good advice based on well-researched evidence and rooting them in real-life stories, the author finds real-life stories and make them fit whatever data he could find on habits.<br /><br />The book start out sharp, with good ideas on how habits are formed and why it matters so much. But as the book progress, it gets worst. More and more of the stories bear inaccuracies. To top it off, poorly researched conclusions are given which only fits the narrow viewpoint of the book. This book is very self-serving of the author...<br /><br />Summary: a few good ideas mired in a swamp of empty emotions.
B0071R43MG|4.0|Great live material by Satriani. 3D looks pretty fine. The only dislike: the sound. Title menu music sounds lots louder than the actual concert music.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Iv always been a Floyd Fan, and often wondered how they managed to put  The Dark Side of the Moon  album together, This DVD explains It, very well Made.
1609611543|5.0|I found many of the items raised in this book to relate to me...interesting the parallels that have been drawn. Not a approach that is for those where wheat-based carbs used to be a mainstay in the diet. First 1-2 weeks is tough, but many of the issues Davis writes about slowly go away. A very good read and well worth the time and money if you are a carb sensitive individual.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|I mist the Movie screening that showed for one day... and a week day at that. My only regret is, I should have gotten the Blue Ray Version instead
B00003CXCS|5.0|This was a first class film showing the wisdom of both having and giving worth nothing ever diminishes, seeing one another in positive and beautiful ways, loving each other totally and through it all, finding things to be glad about, seeing beauty all around us, touching, hugging, holding hands, singing songs of joy, laughing and smiling and giving each other tenderness while aware that none of us should expect each other to always be good much less become perfect for we will both hug and hurt each other from as a child clear up to our last bowl of ice cream right before we fall down and scrape our knee for the last time and then go to a beautiful place for in the eyes of Love giving Life well past anything we could ask for or imagine, we are all, each and every one, every beautiful thing, a wonder, the very best.  So please know that you are loved and race with joy with an untroubled heart in perfect peace and both have and give these and total worth, kindness and gentleness to all who will receive them.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run was fun but rarely a large amount of difficulty. This game adds variety and difficulty. For the price this game can't be beat.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I absolutely loved this book !  I have read almost all of his books, really enjoy his style of writing.  The Lions Game is my favorite book by Nelson DeMille.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book starts out strong, pulling the reader in, and totally convincing you of the facts. Then the plot starts twisiting and turning, keeping the reader turning the pages.  I highly recommend this novel.
B00A81NFAS|4.0|If, while watching \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\", you have previous experience with bipolar disease, then the film will likely speak to your heart.  If, however, you are like me and really don't know anything about bipolar-ism, the humor in the movie will still keep you enjoying it throughout.<br /><br />For a basic plot summary, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" sees Pat (Bradley Cooper), a diagnosed bi-polar sufferer, being released from a mental institution and trying to fit back into his family and society at large.  This includes a father (Robert De Niro) who is a die-hard Eagles fan and is as superstitious as they come, a friend (John Ortiz) completely treading water in his marriage, and a mother (Jacki Weaver) who is always caught in the middle.  It is only after Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a young widow battling multiple personal demons of her own, that he realizes the lengths he must go to in order to succeed in battling his illness.<br /><br />At heart, this is a film about mental illness and its effects on everyday life.  If you have experienced similar situations, the storyline will likely touch you on a very deep level.  Yet, just the humor of some of the situations this crazy family puts itself in will easily be enough to keep your interest level high.  The moral of the story is that we are all a little \\"screwed up\\" on some level, but we just need to find that \\"silver lining\\" to get through life.  Whether those themes touch you a little bit or a lot, there is enough comedy to keep things from really bogging down.<br /><br />Plus, even if all else fails for you in the viewing process, there is the appeal of watching the two beautiful leads.  Lawrence is showcased in enough workout outfits and dance costumes to perk up males in the audience, while I hear the ladies like Mr. Cooper just a tad as well.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" is a solid movie, though not really an all-time classic.  It does enough things right--like make you laugh a little, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way.ttle, think a little, feel a little--to be solid and not boring in any way.

B000VDDDVO|5.0|I purchased this DVD because I have seen the movie many times, but missed it this Christmas, so I wanted to have it to be able to watch anytime I wanted. I love the story, the sense of family and responsibility depicted in the movie. I recommend this movie to every one who likes a good family oriented movie.
1423140605|5.0|It has been read and shared with a friend probably.If it were not good he would not have read it so fast.
B001GXF2YY|4.0|This book kept twisting and turning until the very end! Also, there was no effort to tie everything up in a nice, neat, happy bundle. It was more like real life.
1582701709|4.0|Easy reading!  I saw the movie and I am currently reading the book.  I love it and it makes sense relative to the Bible and logic.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I'm hooked. I love talking to all my clients about this show. Everyone has their favorite character and ideas on what will happen next. Maggie Smith is a delight. Well done Masterpiece Theater!!!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|ok I like it and all but it is WAY to laggy it wont let me run 1/2 the ti.e but besides that its OK
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Personally my most used app. An audiophile's dream, Shazam give you the ability to tag any song you are currently listening to....Just start the app and (you got it...) Shazam! the name of the song and the artist are neatly displayed on your smartphone or tablet. It also give you the option to purchase the song if you choose. Great when you are in a restaurant or even in the car as DJ rarely give any information on songs these days! And it's free!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a lot of fun to play! and you don't even have to wait long for your horse to get more energy.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This is the movie that changed the superhero genre. As directed by Tim Burton, Gotham City becomes a fantastic nightmare in the grips of The Joker, played by Jack Nicholson who steals the show!. Micheal Keeton plays Batman/Bruce Wayne opposite love interest Vicki Vale played by Kim Bassinger. A must have for any comics fan.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it!!! I read it in a couple of days, I just could not put it down! You will love it!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|A little too bulky for my liking but it sure is a solid and well made product. Price was acceptable.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|totally addicting game.  I love it....best one I have downloaded to my kindle so far! Would love to see more games like this
1609611543|3.0|The book makes a lot of sense.  Like other reviewers already stated he does write towards the end you need to cut all grains and most carbs to lose weight.  For someone who is wheat sensitive and does not know for sure  they are this is a good book to start with.  He does repeat himself a lot to make the book long enough to justify the price.  It was not anything I didn't already know so borrowing it for free whould have been a better way to go.  I only buy books I want to keep around for reference this has a few reciepts in the end but still not worth the purchase.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Was almost sending this story in file 13 until I got caught up in the telling of it. The truths and tangles were incredibly thought provoking by the author. An excellent read
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The whole family loves this new game, and we play it all the time. Probably too much time...  all-in-all a good game.
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Coins flow with or without my help.  What's a person supposed to do?  There should be some sort of indication how to play (one that can be easily understood.)
B007X2JV0S|5.0|...what better way to relive it than listen to the soundtrack?<br />The music of David Arnold and Michael Price bring Sherlock to aural life, underscoring the action perfectly.<br />A must have for fans of the show, having to bide their time until season 3 shows up.
0547848412|4.0|Yann Martel's Life of Pi is a story about a fifteen-year-old son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, India. Piscine Molitor Patel or Pi, was aboard a boat shipping his family and the entire zoo off to Canada. Sadly, a storm hits and the ship sinks fast. Pi survived the shipwreck while his family tragically perished on board. He is the only human survivor; however, he had some unlikely company on his lifeboat. The other survivors were a Bengal tiger, a zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan, OJ. Unfortunately, nature took its course and that number became two, leaving just Pi and Richard Parker the tiger on board. Pi quickly established his own territory on the lifeboat, separate from Richard Parker. They are stranded for a long 227 days, filled with Pi's constant waver of hope and doubt, gruesome methods of survival, and a strange seaweed island full of meerkats! Just a fair warning though: the beginning was a little sluggish, but it is full of important back- story for Pi's venture out to sea.<br />The novel may seem almost too simple at first glance. Many may believe the story is just about a boy trapped on a boat with a tiger, who is eventually rescued and all is well with a happy ending. However, Martel challenges the reader to think faith and spirituality throughout Pi's struggles. Pi's simultaneous practice of Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity as a fifteen year old establish him as a very spiritual character just a few pages in. When Pi is rescued and retells the entire story to a few men investigating the shipwreck, they do not believe him. He then tells a different, far more believable story that parallels the first one, but with humans in the place of the animals. Martel created a magical and seemingly unlikely tale, involving a number of religious themes that directly asks the reader, what story should one believe? Accepting Pi's whimsical story as true without substantial evidence, is little different than accepting many fables from the Bible.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Sons of Anarchy just keeps getting better and better.<br />I discovered it on Netflix to stream and watched the two seasons available in less than a week.<br />I couldn't wait for season three and had to buy it on DVD, ripped through it and had to buy season four on DVD.<br />Yes, it's that addictive.<br />Now I'm caught up having watched season five when it was broadcast on F/X.<br />Even so, I'll end up buying that on DVD when available.<br />The show is so good, you want to add the DVDs to your collection.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|I love their sound. I have no complaints about the album. I think that it flowed naturally and the whole album was evidently an extension of themselves and a maturity in how they make music. If you love indie rock with a r&b mix, pick it up.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is awesome but it is not working its not letting me get on!this game is really fun but needs some work
B0035XVVDY|4.0|Super good movie. Both Jamie Fox and Gerard Butler are solid actors and do a good job in this movie.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was a great book<br />The movie must be great to I haven't seen it but it seems good...very good
B0017O1MIM|5.0|.This was a gift. The recipients were overjoyed with it and it was something that they really wanted. A home run.
B009MO5E10|5.0|David Koepp and John Kamps came up with this little idea of making a film about NYC's bike messengers.<br /><br />They wrote a simple story which could be any movie made by Jason Stratham(except he's too old for the role)<br />but they meticulously prepared and wrote the screenplay and made it into one of the most exciting and entertaining<br />action film of this past year with a team of young attractive cast and the great Michael Shannon as a cop.<br /><br />Now this is a film involved storyline about the Chinese immigrants in the US but the filmmakers picked a great<br />Chinese cast and did not turn them into caricatures.<br /><br />A highly recommended entertaining film and not to be missed.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My 15 year old daughter loves this cd and she isn't in love with this boy band. She likes the songs and plays it often. I think most teens and tweens would probably like it
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|I saw this film in the theatre.<br />Tom Hooper took up this challenging task of adapting this often filmed story and world acclaimed musical into film<br />with a finely selected ensemble cast.<br />Hooper also made a crucial decision by filming the singing live throughout the film with an emphasis on dramatic effect<br />than listening pleasure.<br />The result is a well-mounted and impressive motion picture with Oscar worthy performance by Jackman and Hathaway<br />and a fine large cast including the unjustly ridiculed Crowe, a standout performance by Eddie Redmayne and the rowdy<br />diversion provided by Sacha Baron Cohen and Bonham Carter.<br />It is a worthy adaptation and remarkable cinematic achievement.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is one of those can't put it down books. Well written, no slow spots at all that I can recall. If you like Knights and sword fights with just a little of sorcery then you will love this book. The only thing that I didn’t like was when I found out I would have to wait for the next one to be released.
B005LAII8A|2.0|This film had received some great reviews and I was curious to view the film although the storyline of time travel<br />has been filmed to death.<br />The premise is quite simple. When the mob wants to get rid of someone, it brings the someone back from the past and<br />to be killed by the younger self.<br />Does this make sense?<br /><br />Anyway the first hour of so the film was well executed although why would the filmmakers picked Joseph Gordon-Levitt<br />and put him through 3 hours of make-up everyday just to make him resemble a bit like Bruce Willis?<br />So what he doesn't look like Bruce? Or maybe there are someone from the large Hollywood actoring pool who resembles Bruce.<br />Nevertheless, Levitt did a good job, as always.<br /><br />Bruce Willis remains Bruce Willis.<br /><br />The second half of the film made a 180 degree turning into a totally different storyline involving a single mother in a farm with a special boy.<br />Why would the write/director Rian Johnson make this ridiculous storyline is beyond comprehension.<br /><br />Therefore the above title: It would be a ok short film, without the second half.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game its way better than temple run. You will have a blast playing subway surfers i play it every day and love it.
B009AMAM9S|3.0|This film is a labor of love by the filmmakers, the Wachowskis and Tykwer who took years to bring it to the screen.<br />From watching the film and viewing the bonus materials, it is also a labor of love by the large cast and the crew.<br /><br />The film is based on an international best seller with an almost impossible to be made into a movie storyline.<br />The result is unfortunately uneven with multiple stories from the past to present to future with the same team of actors<br />playing different roles and under heavy makeup/prosthetics most of the time.<br /><br />One of the main themes is that every one of us was somebody else, good or bad, throughout the history of mankind.<br /><br />Some of the segments were quite coherent and well acted and directed, especially Jim Braodbent's segments.<br />There were some very funny moments and well-executed action sequences towards the end.<br /><br />The Neo Seoul segment is weak but the South Korean actress Doona Bae did a magnificent acting job for her demanding role.<br /><br />For future filmmakers who plans to film stories involve orientals, please kindly hire some qualified technical advisors.<br />The slant-eyed Koreans look like they were lifted from Paul Muni's \\"Good Earth\\" from the 30's.<br />With western actors made up playing Koreans made it even worst.<br /><br />Halle Berry stands out among the actors by giving a consistently great performance in her various roles.<br />I think Tom Hank was a miscast, although he might be instrumental in getting the project up the ground.<br />Susan Sarandon was also a poor choice.<br /><br />There might be 3 major flaws for this film.<br /><br />One is the ridiculously poor prosthetic make-ups, to the point of being embarrassing and laughable most of the time.<br />With the same actor playing different roles also made it confusing and distracting.<br /><br />Two is some of the storyline is inconsequential which should be cut.<br />They become tiresome for such a long film.<br /><br />Three is sometime the filmmakers are so much in love with their materials that they forget the viewers perceptions.<br /><br />Still, it is worth viewing and could be helped by repeated viewing to fully comprehend the storyline.<br /><br />Be prepared, watch while you're fully energized.lm.<br /><br />Three is sometime the filmmakers are so much in love with their materials that they forget the viewers perceptions.<br /><br />Still, it is worth viewing and could be helped by repeated viewing to fully comprehend the storyline.<br /><br />Be prepared, watch while you're fully energized.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Although the game is exceptionally well designed, having a new ad every new hand is a bother.  It took me several games before I could locate the way out of the ad without going &quot;home&quot; and reloading the hand.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I love the new graphics and obsticals but every time i use a save me it crashes the app and now my person wont slide turn or jump and i dont know why

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun game. Helpful hints. Needs more hidden objects for me instead of puzzle. Wish it was longer play time. Thanks for the fun!
B005S9EKCW|4.0|**WARNING: This review may get rather long. I have a ton of thoughts about this movie, after seeing the stage show so many times. So this may just be me rambling. Also...<br /><br />SPOILERS! SPOILERS! SPOILERS! EVERYWHERE!<br /><br />My review for the higlights CD was less than glowing. However, I can say happily that the CD is a very, very, very, very poor reflection of the movie itself. Ignore the highlights CD. Forget about it. It doesn't do this movie justice. Because while it's far from perfect, I'm can happily say that it is the Les Mis movie musical.<br /><br />THE ACTING<br /><br />HUGH JACKMAN (Jean Valjean)--8/10 Aside from Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman's been getting quite a bit of flack for his Valjean. To be honest, I don't see it. Acting-wise, Jackman is awesome and embodies Valjean. I agree with those who have said he carries the movie. However, singing-wise he was occasionally lacking. He had a habit of speak-singing a LOT. As many have said, his \\"Bring Him Home\\" wasn't exactly stellar and was somewhat disappointing (but not terrible.) So, Hugh Jackman makes for a really good Valjean, with a few vocal flaws that make him a little less than perfect.<br /><br />RUSSELL CROWE (Javert)--7/10 Perhaps the most controversial member of the cast! Personally, I don't think he was that awful. Was he the best Javert ever? No. Do I feel they could have gotten someone better? Yes. However, his voice really isn't that bad. It's off-putting at first, but you get used to it, and once you do, he's decent. His acting made up for his singing. What makes his Javert nice is his more subtle moments (there were little moments in Fantine's arrest and the barricade scenes I really liked.) So, he really isn't that bad. By no means is he amazing, but he's not godawful.<br /><br />ANNE HATHAWAY (Fantine)--9/10 Methinks she was born to play Fantine. First of all, holy CRAP, does Hathaway have pipes. I had no idea she could sing like that. Her Fantine is much more fragile than Fantines in the stage productions I've seen (which makes sense.) She's not a belty Fantine. But although her voice isn't Broadway powerful, you can hear the vocal power underlying in her voice. Her acting is amazing. If she doesn't break your heart, you have no soul. (Her delivery of \\"Come, Cosette. My child, where did you go?\\" Ahhh! Tears!)<br /><br />SACHA BARON COHEN AND HELENA BONHAM CARTER (Thenardier and Mme. Thenardier)-- 6/10 They were fine as the Thenardiers. I didn't feel they were anything spectacular, but they weren't bad. Their \\"Master of the House\\" felt a bit off for me. On one hand, it was much toned down for the stage version, but at the same time, it still felt to gaudy for this movie (although this may have to do more with direction than the actors themselves.) So, like I said, fine, serviceable, but nothing truly special.<br /><br />AMANDA SEYFRIED (Cosette)--5/10 Yeah, she just didn't work for me. Personally, I thought she was worse that Crowe. While I definitely think she has the looks to play Cosette (and her costumes were awesome), she doesn't have a very strong voice. It was shrill and her vibrata was insane. I will say though, she was rather heartbrekaing in the epilogue at Valjean's death.<br /><br />EDDIE REDMAYNE (Marius)--9/10 Like Anne Hathaway, Eddie Redmayne appears to have been born to play Marius. He's got an AMAZING voice, he's attractive (at least, I think so). He also seems to give more depth to Marius's character. His acting, his facial expressions, all add so much more to Marius. His \\"Empty Chairs at Empty Tables\\" was just...there are no words. I will say that his \\"jawbrato\\" got a little distracting. There's nothing really wrong with this, per se, and it may have been more distracting because of all the close-ups. But, hey, I can deal with the jawbrato because Eddie Redmayne is perfection personified.<br /><br />SAMANTHA BARKS (Eponine)--9/10 Vocally, she's awesome. Her voice is more toned down from her theatre days, but it's stillamazing. She plays a more fragile Eponine, who's not the more street-smart, tough Eponine we see in a lot of stage productions. This isn't to say she's weak. Her Eponine has some fight in her, she's just more subtle. Her part seemed quite reduced though, which isn't really her fault, of course. It just would have been nice to see her more.<br /><br />AARON TVEIT (Enjolras)--9/10 Like Samantha Barks, Tveit plays a more subdued version of his character. When I first listened to the recording, I was a tad off-put by how...weak Enjolras seemed. I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG IN MY LIFE! Aaron Tveit has an awesome voice and has a commanding prescence as Enjolras. You almost want more screen time from him.<br /><br />ISABELLE ALLEN and DANIEL HUTTLESTONE (Young Cosette and Gavroche, respectively)--8/10 I was surprisingly impressed with both. Usually, young Cosette and Gavroche are played by terrible singers. But both were freaking adorable. I loved Isabelle Allen, so adorable. Daniel Huttlestone made for a good Gavroche, with plenty of spunk and pluckyness. However, his accent felt a bit forced. (Or maybe it's real. I don't know, I was sort of hoping they'd get rid of the Cockney-accent-straight-from-Oliver-Twist Gavroche and just make him sound like veryone else.)<br /><br />THOUGHTS ON THE CUTS/ADDITIONS/LYRIC CHANGES<br />Being a fan of the musical, I know the libretto pretty well. So I was interested to see what cuts/changes/additions would be made. There were a few changes/cuts I really didn't like. These include:<br /><br />*CUTS FROM \\"ON MY OWN\\" AND \\"A LITTLE FALL OF RAIN\\": Probably due to time. I'm not completely anguished over these cuts (since, if we're being totally honest, Eponine's not the most important character in the first place). But it would have been nice to see Samantha Barks a little more.<br /><br />*CUTS FROM FANTINE'S ARREST: The part that suffers most is the fight between Fantine and Bamatabois. It goes from \\"Here's something new...the usual price for just one slice of your pie\\" to \\"No, no, m'sieur...\\" to \\"You've got some nerve...\\" and then Fantine attacks him. A lot of the lines were cut, including Fantine's \\"I'll kill you, you bastard, try any of that!\\" Again, not to broken up about these cuts, as it helped with time (and I feel like the \\"I'll kill you\\" would have seemed a bit awkward coming from a very weak looking Fantine.) However,e the cuts made the fight seem much, much shorter and if you blink, you might miss all of it. ;)<br /><br />*CUTS FROM \\"DRINK WITH ME\\": This is the last song the students sing together and it has some really good lines in it (Grantaire's verse, especially.) But a lot of it was cut, which was unfortunate, since it was a really good song. It's still there, just not the whole thing.<br /><br />*CUTS FROM \\"EVERY DAY\\": I don't know why they cut Marius's \\"Every day, I wonder who it was that brought me from the barricade\\" as it makes it appear Marius all ready knows who saves him, which then makes Thenardier's whole thing at the wedding seem rather odd. So a little plot hole there.<br /><br />*CUTS FROM \\"THE CONFRONTATION\\": Valjean loses a chunk during the Valjean/Javert harmony, so it's just Javert singing, \\"I was born inside a jail...\\" They also cut everything from \\"And this I swear to you tonight\\" on, which made me sad, especially since it sounded like it was going to be very sad in the script. (Valjean was scripted to be singing to Fantine's dead body as it is flung into a wagon to be buried in the cemetery.)<br /><br />*CUTS FROM \\"THE ATTACK ON RUE PLUMET\\": This cut annoyed me the most. It just seemed so jumpy! Not to mention it sort of creates a little bit of a plot hole. It jumps from Eponine screaming to Valjean hearing it, instantly assuming it's Javert, and deciding to pack up. That's it. He doesn't even interact with Cosette, whose lines there sort of finalize his decision to leave. In the movie, it makes it look like Valjean is just leaving because he heard Cosette scream at who knows what.<br /><br />The cut I did like was reducing the length of \\"Turning.\\" It's always been such a filler song to come before \\"Empty Chairs.\\" (And it was only written so the women ensemble had more to do than be prostitutes.) So, it was nice to see most of that gone.<br /><br />And, I know some of you will stone me for saying this, but I didn't mind that \\"Dog Eats Dog\\" was cut. For one, it really would have slogged the movie's pacing at that point. The way the movie sets it up, you're invested in Marius and Valjean. You probably don't want to hear about Thenardier robbing corpses. So it helped tighten up the pacing. Also, the sewers in the movie are NASTY, so I don't really think I would want to see Thenardier singing a three minute solo in poop.<br /><br />I did like the additional interactions between Valjean and Javert in Montreuil-sur-Mer. It added more depth to Javert's character (like when he asks to be relieved of his position.) Also, these new additions gave us more reason as to why Valjean just sort of turned his back on Fantine at the factory. So, I liked the added lyrics.<br /><br />As for lyric changes, most of them I didn't like. For example:<br /><br />\\"And the plague is coming on fast, ready to kill!\\" Why did that need to be changed? \\"Winter\\" was fine. In fact, it made more sense when the lyrics earlier were \\"At the end of the day you're another day colder and the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill.\\" \\"Plague\\" just sounded sort of silly. This is the 1820s, not the Dark Ages.<br /><br />\\"Follow to the letter your itinerary! This badge of shame you wear until you die.\\" The lines just felt awkward. The other lyrics in the stage version were fine, although I did like the \\"It warns you're a dangerous man\\" in the movie.<br /><br />The lyric change I have mixed feelings for is; \\"It's a story of one who turned form hating. A man who only learned to love when you were in his keeping.\\" I actually like this line a lot, as I think it's just something really sweet for Valjean to say to Cosette. However, the original lines from the stage musicl are, \\"It's a story of those who always loved you. Your mother gave her life for you, then gave you to my keeping.\\" It's a sort of pivotal, if you will, scene in the musical (and book) where Cosette finally learns of her mother, so it was disappointing to see that cut.<br /><br />And the lyric change I love is \\"Would you weep, Cosette, if I were to fall?\\" Not because it's anything stellar or beautiful, but it makes so much more sense. In the musical is, \\"Would you weep, Cosette, should Marius fall?\\" It sounds really dumb. I mean, why is Marius talking in third person about himself anyway?<br /><br />THOUGHTS ON THE SONGS/HOW THEY WERE DONE<br />For the most part, I liked the way everything transitioned to the screen. The new placements of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" and \\"Stars\\" work so much better, in my opinion. IDAD is that much more tragic. Stars makes more sense there, as he's just lost Valjean, and in the stage play, I feel like \\"Stars\\" coming between \\"Look Down\\" and \\"Red and Black\\" sort of interrupts the flow. However, I have mixed feelings for \\"On My Own\\" getting moved. It makes sense as it probably would have been awkward during the barricade scenes. It would have changed the mood midway through. However, I feel like \\"On My Own\\" being right before \\"A Little Fall of Rain\\" works much better, as we've been with Eponine longer and she's finalyl letting it all out. Earlier, we feel pity for her, but not as much. Not to mention that in the new movie placement, it's right after the Rue Plumet robbery, where Valjean decides to leave for England, which is a pretty big moment and then...oh, we're listening to Eponine talk about her love life. Mmkay.<br /><br />I liked how a lot of the songs looked in the movie.<br /><br />\\"Lovely Ladies\\" looked sort of like something out of a horror movie, but I think it helped emphasize the sort of hell the prostitutes are living in. It wasvery toned down and sort of sexless (or at least as sexless as a song about prostitutes can be), which I like a lot. I feel as though \\"Lovely Ladies\\" should focus more on Fantine's fall and the horrible life the prostitues live, as opposed to being overly raunchy and gaudy, like it is in the stage production, for the purpose of just being raunchy.<br /><br />\\"Come to Me\\" was beautifully tragic, with Fantine hallucinating of Cosette. *weeps over keyboard*<br /><br />\\"The Confrontation\\" looked way more epic on screen. It's a cool song in the musical, but it can sometimes be ruined by the cheesy stage fighting. Here, it looks awesome. Javert has a sword! Valjean has a...stick of wood he ripped off a wall! Valjean makes his escape by jumping out of a door into a river! Yay! Cool!<br /><br />\\"Chain Gang/Work Song\\" looked awesome, with the men pulling in the giant ship. Much better than the staging of \\"mime tools.\\"<br /><br />Loved how the finale turned out, when Valjean died. The church, the bishop, ahh! Beautiful!<br /><br />Anyway, to sum this rambling review up, Les Miserables is a semi-flawed, but overall excellent adaptation of the musical that should please most fans.t who knows what.<br /><br />The cut I did like was reducing the length of \\"Turning.\\" It's always been such a filler song to come before \\"Empty Chairs.\\" (And it was only written so the women ensemble had more to do than be prostitutes.)

B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Good game.  Doesn't require money to enjoy the game.  Too bad you don't get some peanuts for giving the game a review.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. It is very fun, but needs to show you how to get to stuff. But I do love it
B0034G4P4Y|4.0|I liked the story line and the motion animation. Good action and adventure. Blah blah blah. I hate that I have to write a certain amount of words.
B008K8U13K|4.0|This game is absolutely fantastic and works great!! Sonic has finally started to get the treatment he deserves on both console AND mobile! Sonic The Hedgehog 4: episode I plays just as well has his 16 bit bretheren of the past!! He now has the homing attack as well which helps enhance the gameplay and has been modified for 2d use perfectly!<br /><br />Only a few issues keep this from being 5 stars though... one would be the controls... i know it's not exactly Sega's fault, but the two virtual control sticks are very frustrating - you can lose place of where your thumbs are at and easily lose control of sonic. The amount of resources it uses should be revised in my opinion, as it DOES drain the battery easily.<br /><br />Overall, this game is great and is a perfect example of how 2D Sonic should work in a modern world!! The controls may be slightly frustrating but when you get used to them, the game is absolutely fabulous!!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|This is the best of the Mission Impossible stories. Great action and acting. Once again I hate having to write a required amount.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is by far the best best best book in the series.  After the first book, I was not really interested in reading any more of them.  However,  upon completing \\"Catching Fire\\", I had to read \\"Mockingjay\\" right away! This book is so quick-paced, and there is so much more happening.  You won't be disappointed.
B0085W09ME|4.0|Seems to pick out constellations, planets, and stars. You have to fiddle around aiming your iphone just right to get the answer .
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander gives an account of his Near Death Experience that is at once candid, believable, exhilarating and moving--and he does it all by blending hard science with soaring spirituality.  I am so glad he lived to tell the tale.

B0000E1WKE|5.0|so Very Miss Houston, it gives her own spirited renditions of age old Christmas favorites.  Her throaty contralto voice glides across the notes.  The upbeat tempo makes you fell why we sing a Joyful Noise Until the Lord.

B00A0NOF7G|4.0|This book is what a call a good beach book to read because it helps you relax and you don't have to think too much when you read it.  I had my suspicions early in the book about who the killer was and I was right but the part I enjoyed the most was learning about Lexie and how she got caught up in this mystery.  I also enjoyed that Lexie's grandma and her friends helped her to solve the mystery.  I will read more books by this author in the future.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was hoping that they would make a 2nd temple run and they did and it's as addicting as the 1st!!! So awesome; I recommend it!!!

B009UX2YAC|3.0|When I first played this game I was like, &quot;It's a rip-off of Temple Run!&quot; but now I see how it's different and I like it. I RECOMMEND!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Imangi Studios really stepped it up from their first Temple Run, because Temple Run 2 is great. I would definately recommend this to someone as a time killer.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|We have enjoyed all the Harry Potter movies as well as the books. JK is an amazing story teller and writer.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This was the best movie of 2012  I loved it even more on the second viewing.  This was purchased as a gift and I hope the recipient will like it as much and I did.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Quick read full of great insight into the world of Apple and Steve Jobs. People like Jobs rarely enter this world
B001QOGYBI|4.0|Like the author, this story has an edge to it. Great to hear Streep and Clooney give voice to a clever production.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought My Horse was very entertaining and I loved the different types of horses you can get I would recommend it to all my friends.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Like the book I read last summer which I couldn't put down, couldn't stop watching this. Hard-hitting dramedy comes wrapped in a dust cloth -- doesn't cover up the message but it doesn't sting as much when you're slapped with it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|One of the most thrilling and addicting games I've ever played on my kindle fire. G5 Entertainment AB is an awesome app maker.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I played it once for like a minute and it won't open!!!!! I tried uninstalling it to reinstall, but it won't do that either! Get this fixed and I will reconsider...
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book it is funny to u need to make a new book because I love all of your books
B008M721MS|4.0|The Skype simply works fine. My only concern why I cannot have a higher resolution than 320X240 on the captured video? In the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 there is a pretty strong CPU or it is still not enough?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this the best game ever so far so good it has so many challenges and I do recommend this ap for anyone pretty much and it has no glitches while I play it it the best temple run was getting old but they really brought it back!!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I can't say enough about Downton Abbey. The second season definitely lives up to the first one. The story is mesmerizing and the characters so real they might step through the screen. Love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is really hard to stop playing.It's just really fun.I think you should really get it.it is really enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book came with rave reviews which had me salivating. I began reading with great eagerness, but found myself slowing down after the third or fourth chapter as it turned into a pretty typical tearjerker about a super-spunky but very sick child. The plot was predictable and the outcome even more so. Not impressed.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|You are there as you read it.  She present the characters so vividly. It starts out light but get very intense quickly.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Last Man: I enjoy espionage and the vivid depiction of how things work behind the scenes. I have read everybook in the  Mitch Rapp series  by Vince Flynn.The man created by Vince's words and my imagination is unrivaled by anyone in Hollywood.  Hopefully, Vince is  writing another bestseller right now!! I have a credit card and am not afraid to use it for another one of these great books---
B00APUQT7I|4.0|The whole family laughed out loud during the whole movie.  Good message about the importance of family as well.  Check it out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Interesting. Not bad graphics. Storyline could use some Improvement. Not liking the whole every horse is named beauty thing when you compete.
B000SEI230|4.0|I found it not quite as interesting as the movie, which had a much, much better and more exciting ending.
1608862801|4.0|Well let me start out by saying that what you see is what you get. It's a Adventure Time comic! It revolves around the TV story but doesn't interfere with it, which makes it a good read for people that haven't seen the TV show and for people that watch it religiously. The only thing that I had a problem with this is that it was TOO SHORT OF A READ! Only if it was more time-inducing.
B004F1F32A|5.0|Liam Nielsen is one bad ass. Non stop a toon and suspense... All he needs now is a hot rod car for the chase scenes
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love that the game has silliness water falls and rivers! I also like that this one has a scene. I LOVE TEMPLE RUN 2!!!!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Great read, full of impressive technical detail. The outcome was predictable but it was never boring. As far fetched as some of it might have seemed, in the back of your mind is the true story of Apollo 13, so just maybe...

B002ZG980U|5.0|I like this movie, it kept my attention the entire way through.  The first time watching it was a little confusing, as the movie was a little deep.  But after watching it over again, I got more out of the movie.  I like Leonardo Dicaprio movies.  If you like a nice suspenseful movie with a good plot then look no further.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really liked the game. it could have been better but I think a lot of people would enjoy it

B00AE2I4WK|3.0|Warning: spoilers for the romantic side plot.<br /><br />I've watched the other Step Up movies at least twice. While the acting and plot wasn't perfect, the first three did a decent job at getting you attached to at least one of the lead dancers. And I watched them all in one sitting.<br /><br />This one however, was different. I didn't feel attached to the main dancers and I didn't feel attached to the plot. I didn't really care if the main characters won or not or stopped Anderson from building his hotel. I kept going: ok, get to the next mob so that I can see the dancing. And the story was moving so slowly that I didn't feel bad about stopping in the middle of the movie to go do something else. I did eventually finish it. I wanted to see Moose come in and dance.<br /><br />The more I think about it, the more the reason why came to light. Because it pulled the same plot device Step Up 3D did. Female lead dancer is related to the bad guy in the film and fails to keep it a secret and the revealing of the secret will be what kicks off the climax of the movie. And the secret coming out leads to the band of dancers breaking up and until the lead male gets over it, the band of dancers just can't seem to move on.<br /><br />If the creators of this movie read this: find a new plot device! In three of the four Step Ups a fight between the lead dancers is the start of the climax of the movie. Step Up 2 the Streets is my favorite of the Step Up movies. Because it doesn't use the romantic sub plot as the problem that kicks off the climax of the movie.<br /><br />Step Up 3D is my second favorite and close to the top because you did something different. The story wasn't just focused on the male and female lead dancers. It also focused on Moose and his relationship with his best friend.<br /><br />We know going in that the plot is secondary to the dancing, it's a dance movie. But give us an interesting plot with some new twists. Don't be afraid to shake things up.

0307352145|5.0|Learning the true meaning of \\"introvert\\" was redemptive for me.  I had been misguided in my belief that a desire to be alone, quiet and observant of what was \\"going on\\" around me was \\"antisocial behavior.\\"  I have learned to enjoy being with people - joking, talking, genuinely interested in being involved in group activities - I have also learned to bless the need for quiet, meaningful attention to one person and stretches of \\"alone time.\\"  This book is the first I have found that articulates, in 268 pages, what has taken me 20 years to more fully grasp.<br /> Ms. Cain, a lawyer by training, consultant/trainer by choice and an introvert by birth, has ably taken the realities of an introverted nature and shown how those talents are not just an asset but are much needed in a culture that \\"requires\\" extroverted behavior in order to fit in.  Extroverts bring excitement, a desire to discover \\"the unexplored country\\" and empower the connection with a broad spectrum of people, all talents needed for innovation, the steady growth of business and the fulfilling of one's vision.  Introverts offer deep reflection and consideration of what is before them, ask the difficult questions of what has been \\"discovered\\" and form deep connections with the people they meet, talents required for continued origination of ideas and steady, healthy expansion of business and obtaining a clearer idea of \\"what's next.\\"<br /> Extroverts and introverts benefit from each other, however, because our culture expects its people to be verbal and socially inclined, behaviors which come naturally to extroverts, introverts are \\"required\\" to be fluent in this extrovert \\"language.\\"  Introverts need space to recharge, particularly after intense or prolonged contact with other people, toward that end it is not uncommon for them to; elect to \\"stay in\\" rather than attend a group activity, find space in the day for \\"quiet.\\"  For many, accepting that they are not flawed for lacking the desire to be in constant contact with people is a place of personal empowerment.  Extroverts can help create the space for quiet by: designing office space with this need in mind, accept that being quiet does not, of necessity, equal bashful or disinterested, plan extra (often lengthy) time between the posing of questions and their being answered.  At the same time introverts will have to act extroverted a moments - during presentations, asserting/supporting an opinion/passion, etc.; extroverts can benefit from having introverted moments - taking a day to answer a question/request of importance, learn a meditation technique, commit an hour of speaking only when asked a direct question but using as few words as possible to answer it, etc..  In so doing, opportunity is given for more rounded ideas to be discovered.  Ms. Cain speaks clearly to and offers suggestions of how the strengths of each can be shared with the other.<br /> This book is a valuable resource for those struggling to fit into a culture that is the most extroverted culture in history when their native tongue is quietness.  The author cites scientific research, relates the experience of other introverts and tells personal stories to present a coherent, well-defined and easily understood text that will help empower a Self whose voice may be soft but is just as well considered when used.  Rather than demanding \\"quiet,\\" this book reveals the truth of how refreshing still waters can be.
0345803485|3.0|This review contains spoilers?  Yeah, I guess so.  When I talk about a work of fiction I like it to be more of a discussion, including the opportunity to be open with my feelings about the ending.<br /><br />So let's get started.<br /><br />When I first started reading Fifty Shades of Grey, and the character Christian Grey was introduced, I honestly imaged him looking like the Mayhem guy from the Allstate commercials.<br /><br />Then as I read more and got to know Fifty Shades better, I started imagining him as that guy from Suits.<br /><br />I think this book was... well, it was fine.  Serviceable.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't great, it worked in its own sphere and satisfied in a general way.  Your mileage may vary depending on your expectations, though.<br /><br />When I began reading Fifty Shades of Grey, I had two family members immediately write me on Facebook telling me I probably shouldn't read this.  One of them then amended her comment, saying the series is a bit disturbing in the first book, but if you follow through until the end it gets better as the protagonist grows as a character and becomes a strong female protagonist.  I paraphrase, but that was the gist.  This put me into the mindset that this was going to be a book about a girl stuck in a dark, abusive relationship and that she would have to eventually pull herself out of.  I was gearing up for something darkly romantic with some intense scary stuff as we watched a nice, troubled girl slowly sink into a quagmire of abuse and guilt that would bring her close to self ruination, only to be saved in the end by some new clarity where she either escapes Grey or manages to help bring him up out of his dark place where they heal together.<br /><br />What I got was completely different.<br /><br />Book one is just about sex.  I'm serious, that's the main focus of the whole book.  Anastasia Steel is a virgin and Christian Grey wants her to be his obedient submissive, but can't until she gets some experience invanilla sex and some light BDSM.  It seems surreal to read a 500+ page book where so little happens.  Erotica is good in short bursts; erotica makes a good short story.  It's not enough to carry a whole book without a VERY interesting plot framing and giving context to the erotic parts.  Otherwise you get a book that's just about sex.  I might as well be reading a guide to erotic massage.  At least that has pictures.<br /><br />One of the first things I thought while reading this book was \\"Wow, this feels like the logical next step after reading the Twilight Saga!\\"  I read the Twilight Saga shortly before reading this.  I wasn't reading anything interesting a couple months ago, so I thought I'd knock out a few of the current pop-book series'.  But this book seriously feels like Twilight with a lemon twist.  I would say to you 18-somethings that if Twilight was the series that made a reader out of you, pick up this series: it's next on your list and is right up your alley.  You might then be pleased and fascinated to learn that this book was inspired by Twilight, and that the author originally intended this to be a Twilight fan fiction before making it into something original.  That's... kinda awesome really.<br /><br />Unlike Twilight, however, this book has a protagonist that drives the plot.  If I ever get around to writing a review of Breaking Dawn, I'd like to point out that Bella Swan does not drive the plot of her own series.  She goes in search of the plot, generally can be relied upon to be where interesting things are happening, but as a character she does not control the story: she does and says all the right things so that there is a story.  Ana however DOES drive this plot.  We follow her actions and understand her motives.  We get a constant stream of consciousness from her on every little subject and we are never confused or in conflict about her motives since they all generally make sense based on what we understand about her from what we hear in herhead.  That's a plus.  The minus, unfortunately, is that by the very nature of the type of relationship she has with Grey, she is often left out of the more interesting parts of the plot.  But I'm getting ahead of myself I think.<br /><br />The sad thing about this book is that it's a waste of perfectly good potential.  I'm serious, where this book ends feels like something that should have happened much earlier.  So little happens in this book that it feels in retrospect like an elongated setup where all it accomplished was to introduce the characters and describe a variety reasons why Steel and Grey are sexually compatible.  It's toothless and safe.  It's just right for you if you got your start with Twilight.<br /><br />Minor Additions:<br /><br />One thing that irritates me is the way these characters are with technology.  I know it's a petty gripe, but it rubs me the wrong way.  First off, Grey uses a Blackberry.  A Blackberry.  In 2011.  A guy who's a control freak, hyper insecure, and is obsessed with security uses a Blackberry for business.  And gets his gf one.  Blackberry was hacked a few years ago, putting the data of thousands of companies and people at risk, lost all credibility when that happened, and has failed to stay relevant along side their superior rivals, Apple and Google.  Plus Grey has already established himself as a user of Apple products.  He would not use a Blackberry.  He would have the latest iPhone.  He would have given Ana an iPhone.<br /><br />Next, Ana's iPod.  Ana owns an iPod, but doesn't have a computer.  iPods cannot be loaded with music without a computer.  'She uses her roommates computer'- So her roommate keeps Ana's music on her computer?  Does Ana have an iTunes account so she can obtain music for her iPod?  She can't because she doesn't have AN EMAIL ADDRESS!  Seriously, she's about to piss herself in this book when she realizes she has an email account Christian created for her.  A 21 year old girl in 2011 doesn't have anemail account.<br /><br />Anyway, that irritated me.
1451695187|4.0|When Dr. Eben Alexander, M.D. went to bed On 9 November 2008 his back was achy, when he awoke the next morning at 4:30, the pain was severe.  By 9:30 of that morning he was in a coma.  What began as a small discomfort was the early onset of a deadly disease.  When an otherwise healthy individual contracts spontaneous E. coli bacterial meningitis (a 1 in 10,000,000 occurrence), spends seven days in a coma and fully recovers (90% of the individuals who suffer this malady die, the remaining 10% remain in a sustained vegetative state), \\"miracle\\" is the only fitting term.  The fact of his survival remains unprecedented in the annals of Medical Journals.  What is most remarkable, however, was what he experienced while in the coma.  Dr. Alexander is convinced that he spent those seven days in a place \\"more real\\" and  \\"more beautiful,\\" where he learned without limits or filters of matters that will take him \\"the rest of his life to sort out,\\" and which he understood Love is the core of the universe; he visited what is commonly called \\"Heaven.\\"<br /> This book is a wonder in itself.  It is written in \\"real time,\\" what is going in the ICU as he his cared for my his family and his fellow medical personnel is the undercurrent to what he experienced away from his body as both events are told concurrently.  There is not an issue with both events happening at once as time was not measured the same there as \\"here.\\"  What he experienced \\"there\\" was lifetimes but only a second.  He needed no language, as thoughts were given and received, learning occurred instantly at a volume indescribable and depth that made it permanent.  As his family held his hand, talked to him and made sure he was never alone, he was soaring between \\"levels\\" of heaven and experiencing \\"the Core\\" of all existence.<br />His difficulty in describing exactly what he saw was a matter of limited speech. (How does one describe chocolate to one whom has never tasted that treat?  How to relate the vastness of the GrandCanyon to someone who has never seen a valley?  These are the difficulties Dr. Alexander faces in trying to relate his experience.)  He possesses the intelligence, the vocabulary and the ability to relate difficult concepts clearly (he has been a medical researcher and neurosurgeon for over 25 years) yet he is greatly limited to the use of inadequate tools to detail the glories he saw.  The description he was able to present caused my heart to race - THAT is how magnificent what he saw was.<br />After he recovered (all of his faculties returned within a few months of his illness) he researched Near Death Experiences (NDEs), a field of rich documentation, spanning decades and multiple cultural strata, that he has ignored because he \\"knew the about NDEs without caring about the facts.\\"  The last 50 pages of the text are devoted to his speaking of the medical validation of his experience.  As a skeptical scientist, he knows the difficulty before him as he speaks to his fellow scientists of what he learned.  He argues a strong case.<br />As a therapist, I was skeptical of many of the events/details Dr. Alexander posits in this book.  His was a VERY sick brain, under unimaginable stress.  I have seen what that organ can make up when people are under far less stress.  His ending the book addressing many of the questions I pondered was a help.  His brain, according to his illness, was not stressed, the parts of his brain that \\"caused\\" him to be human \\"WERE OFF LINE,\\" they were unavailable to create hallucinations/dreams/logic.  In other words, he was not capable of making up the elaborate events during his illness.<br />As a Theologian, much of what he said resonated deeply within me.  His speaking of all things being connected, of his \\"being a part of all there is,\\" reminded me of some of the profound Spiritual moments in my life.  I want to believe there is a place where my Grandfather Stonecypher can hear, where my Mom-by-Marriage can remember my name, where my Uncle Ted can see.  A place, as the old hymn states, \\"of quiet rest, near to the heart of God.\\"  A home where the greeting is, as it was for Dr. Alexander:<br />\\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.\\"<br />\\"You have nothing to fear.\\"<br />\\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\\" (p.41)<br />That is the message of hope upon which my theology stands.
0345803493|2.0|Spoiler review again, all my reviews have spoilers so get used to this.<br /><br />Ugh....  I'm really surprised about how bad I didn't like this book.  I didn't hate it; there's only a select few books I've genuinely hated.  This book couldn't make me muster up enough emotion to hate it.  This book pretty much broke all my hopes and made me realize what this series REALLY is: a simple erotic love story.  There's not enough of a plot to make it any more than that.  There's nothing particularly shocking or morbid to warrant any deeper interpretation of character motives or other plot elements.<br /><br />Christian Grey is messed up, but ALL HE NEEDS IS LOVE!  Seriously, his love for Anastasia Grey is enough to 'fix' him, and he is fixed so quickly it makes you wonder if he ever had much of an issue to begin with.  Does he still have some issues?  Yeah, sure, but they're manageable issues.  His mercurial personality some have described as multiple personality disorder or something, but every time he has a shift in mood it's preambled by some fairly obvious stimuli.  Grey's not a hard man to predict.<br /><br />Let me dictate to you a plot that I think would be better using the setup James created for us here.  Imagine with me a story where Anastasia Steel signs the contract.  Like... right away!  Maybe they have sex to let Ana get some general experience since she's a virgin and then Christian has her sign the contract.  She is head-over-heels for Grey and has some personality issues that lead her to deliver herself wholly to him largely out of fear of losing him.  She doesn't want the scary, abusive sex he likes, but does it because she can't imagine herself with anyone else and will do anything for him.  If you'd like, lets say book one leads up to her signing the contract at the end.  Book two would be her living under the harsh rules Christian sets for her.  Her relationship with her friends and family start to deteriorate as she goes deeper and deeper into Grey'sdark and scary world.  At first it's hard for her, she resists and fights his rules, gets punished and Grey slowly begins to break her.  Then lets say near the end of Book two some twists occur that force her to see Grey in a new light.  Maybe she learns about his past, why he's the way he is, or meets Leila in the context of her a sub of Christian.  Backpedaling a bit, I'll concede you could add the bit about her wanting more and Grey wanting to try for more, but still in the framework of his messed up version of love.  Whatever revelation happens forces Ana into one of several possible paths, leading to a different ending in book three depending on the path.  Path one: Ana tries to fix Grey, succeeds in book three and ends with them in a healthy relationship.  Path two: Ana tries to fix Grey, succeeds in book three but leaves him anyway.  Path three: Ana tries to fix Grey, fails and leaves him for her own good.<br /><br />There could conceivably be more paths, one where Ana stays with Grey in the abusive relationship or leaves cold turkey, but those would be somewhat anticlimactic and wouldn't make for good reading.<br /><br />Now, I don't know about you, but I'd much rather read my book.  It would truly be dicey story about forbidden love where you could sympathize with both Ana and Grey as you understand the motives of both.  You wouldn't know for sure which of the three endings the story will have because the setup could easily lead to any of them.  Also it would have depicted a female protagonist who had use her inner strength to overcome a harmful situation and find her true value, that it doesn't need to be tied up in the esteem of an attractive billionaire.<br /><br />I started Fifty Shades of Grey with that expectation!  You see why I don't like this book and feel like the series as a whole is an irritating waste of potential?  I give book one three stars for the setup.  I don't think you'd have to change much about it for it to still be part of a more interesting story.  But what kills this series is book two, Fifty Shades Darker.<br /><br />Darker?  Really?  What's dark about this?  It's not like this is the Empire Strikes Back or something.  I guess someone told James the second act in a three act story is the darkest, but she seemed to have forgotten that between writing the title and beginning the story.  It ends on such a high with most plot elements resolved by the end, minus one, which was nothing more than a tease to get you to read the last book.<br /><br />This book just has more sex.  Vanilla sex.  And Grey's past is explained.  And why he likes to beat women.  Which wasn't much of a big deal.  The big reveal is that he beats only the ones who look like his mom because his mom was neglectful and died when he was a child.  We knew his mom was a brunette from a scene earlier in the book, so as soon as we knew that, we knew that had something to do with his choice of subs because they're all brunette, also explained earlier on.  So when he tells this to Ana, that he likes to beat women who look like his mom, she freaks out.  Then we the readers are stuck thinking \\"Didn't we already kinda know that?  Also, hasn't he already pretty much given up his dom-sub lifestyle for Ana?  Is this really relevant information?  We know the creepy relationships were under contract and completely consensual, what's the REAL problem?  Yeah, it's creepy, but not THAT creepy..., especially since it was predicable and ALL HE NEEDED WAS LOVE and is mostly all better now.\\"<br /><br />Aside from that, this book has a serious issue with Ana as our narrator.  As mentioned in my Grey review, the very nature of the relationship between Ana and Christian often forces Ana out of the more interesting parts of the plot.  There are several times when something interesting is happening with Christian (such as his encounter with Leila), but Ana is forced out of the scene because of Christian control issues.  This seems more like a problem with James' choice of point of view.  If this had been third-person-omniscient,  I have no doubt this would be a much more satisfying read.  When you stick the narrative into the point of view of only one character, you need that character to be constantly involved in the most interesting points of the plot.  Christian would not have made a good narrator, or we'd just be reading a bunch of angst.<br /><br />That's why even though I say Bella from Twilight couldn't drive the plot, she at least did what it took to always be where the plot was happening.  And when she wasn't where the plot was, Meyer at least had the common decency to bring the plot to Bella.  Ana is so often excluded I found myself bored through most of this book.  This book tries to bring in some interesting b-plots to enhance the a-plot (which is just sex), but they fall flat and go nowhere or are resolved away from Ana, or in other words, away from us.<br /><br />There was a significantly interesting part where Ana wonders briefly if this whole thing with Leila is partially made up.  I remember thinking that would be the best possible thing James could have done with this book.  Just imagine if Leila wasn't a threat?  Imagine if the only thing Leila did was creep up on Ana outside her work and say some weird stuff and run off?  What if Christian sent his bodyguards on a wild goose chase and filled Ana with paranoia about her or his life being in danger.  Wouldn't that just be perfect?  Imagine the big reveal that there was no Leila all along, that Grey used her to keep Ana scared and dependent on him for her safety so he can keep up with his creepy control obsession.  Wouldn't the visit with Dr. Flynn have been so much more interesting in that context?  But no... Leila just missed her dom.  Nothing interesting to see here...<br /><br />Oh, and the visit with Dr. Flynn!  I have to talk about that!  Wasn't that one of the biggest letdowns in the whole book?  They hyped it up for about half the narrative, making you think it was going to involve some serious reveals.  And during the visit it seems interesting.  It starts with Ana talking to Flynn alone at first.  Then, you think, naturally Grey would come in and they'd talk together, maybe finally Ana would leave after an hour and it would be just Grey talking to Flynn.  We'd be left out of that part, but I guess we'd pass the time listening to Ana digest what was talked about.  That seemed like what would happen.  It even lead up to that all the way until Grey came in.  A weird part of how Ana views herself is revealed and it feels like that's going to be the center of discussion for the next chapter or so.  But no... Grey comes in and they go home.  Nothing interesting is discovered in the end.  No depth.  No closure.<br /><br />Then there's a buildup with regard to Grey's first lover, dubbed Mrs. Robinson, about whether or not what she did to him was bad, maybe it was helpful or saved him from worse fates, and a continuing occurrence where she tries to meet privately with Ana to talk about stuff (which only could have been interesting, more interesting than Ana resolutely telling her 'no').  You keep screaming in your head to Ana \\"Go talk to her!  I want to know what she has to say!\\", but she never does.  But no... it turns out she was evil all along and runs away after a brief confrontation with Ana, Grey, and later, Mrs. Grey.  Will she come back for book three?  Probably, but I'm significantly less interested at this point.<br /><br />It was this kind of stuff that made me notice a big weakness in James' ability as a writer.  She can't sustain interesting dialog between characters.  It's like she begins a scene with a good idea, and I as a novice writer can imagine her going over in her head what she wants to happen.  Then she tries to apply it to paper and comes up short.  The idea runs out before it's done.  Maybe she feels nervous about going that long without a sex scene, which is clearly her comfort zone.  I'll bet even she felt annoyed when she can't finish a scene properly.  She ends up having to end it, maybe thinking when she comes back for a second or third draft she can add more, but the moment has passed and it's best to stick with what you got, I guess.<br /><br />Oh well.  I still want to see where it goes and I still stand by my original statement in my review of book one that it is serviceable as simple entertainment.  It's serviceable.  It's average.  It's acceptable.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Tim's work and in this book he provides some easy to follow instructions to get in the best shape of your life.  If you are looking for just fat loss, he maps out the perfect plan.  If you want to gain muscle, he also maps this out.  Best of all, his instructions are simple, easy to follow, and spot on.  I've been doing p90x for years and absolutely love the exercises.  The diet program was way too complex to follow and I ended up washing out after the 1st month on the food portion.  Today I combine exercises from Tim's book, some p90x, but most importantly, I follow Tim's slow carb diet.  It works.  I've lost 20lbs in 18 days and going for another 20 lbs over the next two months.  The book also has lots of additional tid bits for people that want to learn more about the body other than just weight loss or muscle gain.  There is a huge section on recovering from sports related injuries as well.

B00APUYN0I|4.0|Enjoyable film about collegiate a cappella singing.  Quality of streaming was horrible, however.  I'm not sure if that was because of Amazon or our internet/cable provider.  Despite that, my daughter and I found the film to be funny and I thought it had a good message about teamwork, being true to yourself, etc.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|was very easy and sounds good.  just like playing piano. would like more shorter songs. More up to date songs

B005C6HGSG|5.0|There is a reason that there are no negative reviews on this book ( as of my review). This book is GOOD. It really sounds like Bobby Signer is writing it. Very true to character. It also gives you more incite into a man who is very much loved by the fan base, and lets you know how his first hunt goes. I really enjoyed this book! Great for any fan of the show!

B009FZFONO|5.0|The creators of The Walking Dead are not afraid to push the limits of what is expected from a normal tv series. I was litterally on edge the entire series. You feel as though you are with the characters and facing the same battles that they are. I would recommend this series to anyone interested in zombies or post-apocolyptic dramas. It is graphic however and I have had several nightmares about the series--however some of them are actually pretty cool. Anyways, its a great series!

B006GHA9QQ|5.0|Although this is a recording of a stage show, it is a VERY HIGH QUALITY stage show... the music (since it's the same composer as the original) is amazing, and the actors do a wonderful job.  Though the story itself is not as powerful as &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34;, it is still very engaging and tugs at your emotions.  The ending is a bit of a shock.

B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I picked up Crossed after reading Matched. I didn't love Matched, but it got better toward the end, and it left off on enough of a cliffhanger that I wanted to know what happened next. The beginning immediately drew me in, mostly because it starts off from Ky's perspective. Matched was entirely in Cassia's perspective, so it was a nice change of pace.<br /><br />Crossed is not an edge-of-your-seat, action-packed, thrilling story. Most of the book centers around Ky's and Cassia's journey and struggle to find each other. But I still found myself completely sucked in and invested in this story. Even if what they are doing in the actual scene is completely harmless or mundane, the reader is always aware of the danger and the threat of being caught looming over every minor action. Also, there were enough little mysteries throughout the book to keep you wondering.<br /><br />I really liked the characters in this book. Even Cassia and Ky grew a lot for me, and I found myself more interested in their story and rooting for them. The supporting characters of Indie and Eli were really interesting, too. I think their personalities and slightly mysterious backstories helped to develop Cassia and Ky. I didn't really like Xander from the first book, so his not being a big part of this book didn't really bother me.<br /><br />Crossed ended more abruptly than I expected, but again with enough of a cliffhanger to make me want to keep reading. I have to know what happens with the rest of this story!
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I've been looking at this set for a few months and once I saw that amazon had it for $358, I immediately jumped on it. The price is pretty high but it is at a very decent price when looking at other sets. Every 1000 pieces pretty much equals $100 when it comes to Lego. I bought this set for my girlfriend and I and it was very fun putting together. I would advise purchasing this set now before the price sky rockets since 2012 was the last year Lego produced this set.<br /><br />I was not missing any pieces, I was worried because I read a few people here complaining about missing pieces. I think that those people just used the wrong color piece or they lost the pieces themselves. My set was complete and I was 100% satisfied with my purchase. I would purchase this set again.
0316228532|2.0|Let me preface this by saying that I read this book solely because it was written by J.K. Rowling. The description did not really appeal to me, but since I loved her writing in Harry Potter so much, I felt I had to give it a try. Maybe I would be pleasantly surprised?<br /><br />I wasn't. I have read books that have handled touchy subjects and adult issues and enjoyed them. But I just found something missing here. First, I found that there were too many characters. I found myself often flipping back to other sections to remind myself who they were. I was probably at least 150 pages in before I could keep them all straight.<br /><br />Second, I just didn't feel like there was a major plot. I couldn't really figure out what the point was? People fight? Bad things happen to people? I honestly didn't get it. And because I couldn't find a major plot/conflict, I also didn't find much of a conclusion.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there were definitely some parts of this book that had me flipping feverishly and parts that brought tears to my eyes, but most of it just felt like a struggle. Honestly, if it had been written by any other author, I would not have finished it.<br /><br />As far as the ending, again, I didn't get it. It didn't really tie anything up, and I wonder how she decided where to end this story.<br /><br />In short, as much as I wanted to love this book, I just was not impressed.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|I have never read the original books by Arthur Conan Doyle. I got this full collection and so far it is great. I recommend this to any one who likes Sherlock Holmes. This is also a great set because it has all the volumes and that is a lot to read.
B001TJSZK8|5.0|Amazing this was written so long ago!  Everyone deservers the chance to read Moomin, highly recommend buying this book .
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is the best app ever. I could play this game for hours. Temple run 2 is way better than the first temple Run.
B009O07NMA|5.0|This entire cd is filled with great songs. Florida Georgia Line is top of the charts to me. Love this band and highly recommend this cd
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a really interesting game. I really have to think about my next move. But at the same time i thoroughly enjoy playing the game.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Since its arrival at my home, I have completely caught up & viewed S1/S2 at least 4x. Much more engrossing than Upstairs, Downstairs and a completely welcome addition to Gosford Park!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Crazy fun + free = get it, and that's exactly what I think you should do. The game is supper addicting.
B00AW0KHMY|1.0|8 minutes and you expect me to pay 19.99 for a movie that I already have with 8 more minutes added to it. That's ridiculous.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|I loved Lep' s world so much! But I have to say Lep' s world 2 is even more fun and exciting! This version has so much variety and the graphics are amazing! I gave it four stars because after a while it gets kind of boring. It starts to feel like the same old thing over and over again. Also my character will start to go at a snail's pace and the left and right keys won' t work. But all and all it is a great game! I totally recommend it! ( By the way it' s FREE so, just go for it!)
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app is perfect. It allows you to access your downloads (pictures, pdfs, word docs, videos), access the files from other apps (for example I deleted a youtube video downloading app, the videos were deleted from the video tab on my kindle but they were saved in es explorer. This is because es explorer creates a folder for each app.), and you can even create documents with it. This app has made my kindle experience so much better.
B0085MNZ66|3.0|I had hoped for something with slightly more brilliant colors. It is OK and I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for something that does colors. I did find something that fit the bill better for me.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It lacks in graphics,because i played on an Ipod touch and the visuals are way better for instance, the coins spin, there are more scenery and stuff on the ipod and ipad...I think somebody should make a HD Version of this game.
B00AYDC3CG|5.0|A perfect family movie...this film makes you think how important pets can be and how they can make you happy.
B000FGGE68|5.0|it was an amazing movie and one of my all time favorites and i highly recommend it it is incredible.
0812993292|5.0|The Proclaimers song was running through my head the whole time I was reading this story.<br /><br />I don't really know what drew me to this book, or why I decided to buy it. I've never heard of Rachel Joyce, and I am not usually very keen on books or movies or any stories to do with older (40+) people - no offense. But this seemed like it had such an interesting premise, and although I resisted buying it the first few times, I kept going back to it every time I found myself at a bookstore. Eventually, I gave in and bought it.<br /><br />When I started reading it, I thought it was going to be one of those stories that dragged and took me ages to finish. Not at all.<br /><br />I was blown away by the wonderful prose, the descriptions, the passion, the struggle, and the realistic depiction of this bizarre journey. I found myself growing to truly love Harold and everything he represented, and found myself growing fond of Maureen and Rex, even. I was concerned for Harold's welfare, excited for him, and invested in his every step.<br /><br />When Harold, a retired old man living in the comfort of his ordinary, uneventful life, receives a letter from an old colleague who had done him a great favour and disappeared from his life, he finds himself thinking of what is left of his life. She tells him that she is dying of cancer, and that upsets him more than he can imagine. He inadequately responds to her letter, but when he sets off to mail it, he finds himself walking past all mailboxes. When he stops at a convenience store to grab a bite to eat, the girl at the cashier tells him about her sick aunt and how sometimes you need to have a little faith that they will get better. It becomes Harold's purpose to continue walking, all the way to Queenie (his former colleague), in order to keep her alive as long as possible. He asks her to hold on, while he makes this long journey to her - on foot. In just his yachting shoes and everyday clothes.<br /><br />He sets out on this 800+ (with all the stops and errors) mile journey from Kingsbridge to Berwick-upon-Tweed. The transformation of Harold and Maureen throughout this journey, while one is walking across the country, and the other is sitting at home waiting, is what I found most beguiling about this book. Their memories, the little bits and pieces you learn about them as the book progresses, how you start to put all the puzzle pieces together and figure out where it all went wrong and pinpoint when it was starting to get better again, makes it a worthy read.<br /><br />A marriage once broken is now being put to rights, and you are rooting for them the whole way through. Not to mention all the eccentric and memorable characters that Harold meets on his journey that play a little part in his transformation. As Harold walks and walks and walks he observes that \\"life was very different when you walked through it\\".<br /><br />This story portrays so many different emotions from sadness to pure joy, from desperation to hope, from hate to love - as well as the occasional dash of humour.<br /><br />I loved the ending and the fact that Joyce did not reveal the inside joke between Harold and Maureen, leaving us to wonder about what it was that was so funny. It was the perfect ending in my opinion, a private moment shared between two people who have been married for as long as they can remember. And best of all, keeping it that way - private.(with all the stops and errors) mile journey from Kingsbridge to Berwick-upon-Tweed.

B008F5YDRI|4.0|An enjoyable feel good movie that was well acted.<br />The writing for the supporting characters tends to be a bit thin.
0020518501|5.0|This story is one of a kind. Hemingway is unique unto himself.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|Never gets old; always fresh. A clear-eyed view of the deadly bureaucracy of industrial-strength war making and the scars it leaves.
0307591549|5.0|A lot of books are great for motivation but really light on actual steps. With The Happiness Advantage, that is not a problem. The author starts off discussing why our traditional achievement-based ideas of happiness are flawed, and goes on to give seven clear principles that can help us find actual happiness. I found this book very helpful and worth multiple reads.
B0063GORYU|5.0|EASY TO PLAY. Nice!<br />No bugs that I have run across. Hints are logical and helpful. I'm happy to recommend this game.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a fun and interesting read. I enjoyed the main character, the plot, and the use of hard science. Really a fun read. I'm looking forward to more of this ilk from this author.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|the game it is not realy free. You can play only the begining and then you must pay for it
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I bought the book because I had seen the movie which, frankly, left me a little confused. The book was clearer. it is well written and a nice piece of brain candy.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I just love this app. I can finally get music on my kindle fire without having to buy it and it works just great.
B00A9X9ORI|2.0|not a good movie. unless you are just a big Bruce Willis fan, skip this one, Even the story is bad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A overall great game. Great graphics. If you love horses then this a game for you. I absolutely love this game. :)
B002KVCA1O|5.0|Picking the Rolling Stones to listen to is a no brainier. Being able to get it on amazon is something that makes life a little easier. I like the price for 18 songs.
B008AT71WI|5.0|A wonderful, classic musical comedy.  Presented for the very first time in a high definition format and the legendary original ending.<br /><br />Arrived fast and in perfect condition.
B005HSG3TC|1.0|this case was bulky . it was not convenient to carry . I did not like it at all .
B0025KW29U|5.0|I bought this Blu Ray after having bought the mobile version from iTunes.  Yes, it was totally worth paying for twice.
B00390BE7G|5.0|Eye opening, it is hard to read at times, but this information must be absorbed and dealt with to fully appreciate what really happens in the world.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a great game but it always doesn't let me play the second day I have it.  If they fix it the game would get 5 stars.
B0071CNGI8|5.0|Great book...flows smoothly and interest is always alive.  I would recommend this book to anyone, especially horse and history buffs.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Great movie...funny, charming, and thoroughly entertaining. The story is cute and whatever age the guests are, they love it...young and OLD.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The main character is awesome.  I found myself laughing at some of his comments/actions.  The science comes across as believable, without being too techie.  Give it a chance, you will not regret it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun app I was expecting it to be one of those play a level or twoand then have to pay but i was surprised to find out it was not.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|i like to play it but i realy like buying stuff too. instead of having me go up coins i go down.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is amazing, every time I play minecraft pocket edition. It's just so addicting... and can't wait till the next update which comes out tomorrow. Hopefully since it takes 6 days for them to review it. :) can't wait. It's worth the money.
B000I9UA8U|5.0|These guys, all of them are so good in this movie. It's a great, cute, moving at times, story. It's one of my all time favorites !!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game! I like that you can just keep restarting once you mess up and its not  based on how many \\"lifes\\" you have.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I was so excited when this came out and they look amazing in blu-ray. Im a huge Jurassic Park fan probobly because it was the first movie i ever saw in theaters, and wow it looked amazing on our tv again!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its the best you do every thing you would do for a real horse! its free
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang should add armor to the game!<br />Armor is a cool idea to add to the game.Armor will help to protect the players.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is so much fun, after a busy day at work.  It relaxes me, and I don't have to think hard, it's just fun to slash at fruit, and take out your frustrations from the day.  It's rather funny.
B007VPLNGW|5.0|easy to use,addictive! excellent to kill time while you wait for something.  My 4 years old boy loves it too. Nice to keep him busy while we eat on a restaurant
B008X9Z3UC|5.0|Very nice pouch, zips with ease.  My kindle is well protected, and it looks very stylish.  I can also insert my stylet, so I always have it handy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|A very wordy book with more focus on the characters and less on the plot. Too bad because there was potential.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Just as crazy as ever. Old game yes, but it's till got something to hold ur attention. Give it a try.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|The voices of the young ladies are Angelic and I could listen to them any time of the day or year.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I watched the first 2 seasons before reading the book but I am determined to finish at least up to the third book before Season 3 comes out. Normally, when books are made into movies or series, they are not done to justice. This is an exception. It is a fantastic, easy-to-read book and I am wasting no time in buying the second book (even though I know what happens) as well as the rest of the series. I do not read as often as I like and I often start books and never get to finishing them, but I could hardly put this one down. It is an epic I'd put in the same category as Lord of the Rings.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I could listen to this any time I'm down and their Angelic voices are uplifting which in turn brighten my day
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This movie met all my expectations.  It was Just the right amount of action and drama.  I would definitely recommend this movie.
B000JLTR8G|5.0|I chose 5 Stars for two reasons:<br /><br />The film was delivered in less than 10 days, and I had not seen this movie for over 20 years.  It was amazing, held up to the test of time, and kept me glued to the screen-- OUTSTANDING!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It is not  quite my favorite game but I think it's a good game.  I'd give you a pretty good score
B0001IN07Q|4.0|This is a very good CD and I like this a lot and will purchase more of Michael Buble CD's.
B002ONIST6|4.0|A brilliant script adapted from a true story with stellar performances from both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe. This movie is a must have for your dvd collection.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Its not bullet proof, but it serves its purpose!! I strongly recommend buying this along with the kindle for protection.
1878424114|5.0|Honest, simple yet timeless information.  Have not had the book long, but I'm moving through it one chapter at a time and making an effort to extend my every moment consciousness.  Good reading.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like this game a lot. I think people should play this game. It's easy to play and under stand.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This young woman was on quite a journey and did a good job putting her experience to paper. Walking the Pacific Crest Trail is undoubtedly very difficult and she wrote about her experience with humor and grace but yet communicated the difficulties she faced. Worth reading.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|it is very compelling, and hard to stop watching. Also the filming and detail to attention is wonderful. he really builds the main character form a simple guy to a murder in a really believable way.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|i did enjoy this book as i am from the Puget Sound and know the island. the female character is strong and very capable which i also loved. this is a love story that is quite good but not great. still worth a read.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|i am hoping this movie comes in great condition  i am ordering it for my sister she can watch it together for my mother who is staying with her  she is a 90 year old farm house wife
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I have tried this on my phone years ago and knew there were some ads in the upper corner. In this version the ads come up between rounds and block out the game. They make you wait and click icons before you are allowed to play more. Very Aggravating !!!
0805092447|5.0|This book is great for teaching basic sight words, because words like see appear often , kids are bound to learn these words.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Amazing game, and I would give it five stars, except when I tried to upgrade the graphics level,  it crashed, and I had to uninstall it... I installed it again, though... too good to not!!!  :)
0060235152|5.0|A  very GOOD BOOK, IN EXCELLENT CONDITION,  my  son enjoyed me reading it to him and so did  my KINDERGARTEN CLASS.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved the original Temple Run, but this one is so much more fun! I really like the mine areas and the 'save me ' option.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|The same thing happened with the movie Hope Springs.  Around the last 30 minute mark the movie froze up and I could not manipulate it with any of the Roku remote control buttons.  I had no option (after watching a frozen screen for many minutes) but to shut it down.  I later started it back up but it would not start during multiple attempts.  I was finally able to complete the movie after a restart 30-60 minutes after my last attempt.<br />The same thing happened with the movie Hope Springs which I received a refund of 3.99 today from Amazon.<br />Thank you
B0009WFFS6|5.0|Probably the best concert disc i've ever listened to with no exception...<br /><br />The DTS soundtrack format is breathtaking, Jack Bruce I feel steels the show, and his voice has to be the most prolific in rock music.<br /><br />Camera shots are terrific, and thank goodness they did not ruin this like so many others have.<br />I makes you feel like you are sitting in the first section with them....<br /><br />Spoonful, White Room, Crossroads..my goodness.<br /><br />The shots of all the old rockers in the audience are one of amazement....<br /><br />Ginger Baker, what a drummer, that sound is coming out of that person? Incredible...<br /><br />Eric: what can you say, the consummate guitarist, sober, looking good, and in his glory.<br />Thanks Eric for driving the reunion.....
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its a fun game with good gtafics but I cant get it to work on my kindle fire! so I scored it a two star game
B000FZET5W|5.0|This was an excellent product and I was very pleased with the order process and the product that I received.  Thanks !!!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I find Dark Arcana to have a very interesting and unique storyline, as well as fun little object finds and puzzles along the way. I enjoyed the free version highly, influencing me to purchase the full version.
B005R4255C|5.0|I bought the deluxe version of this amazing album at Walmart when I saw it. I knew that if I couldn't see Cirque Du Soleil The Immortal Michael Jackson when they were in the U.S I mine as well get the music and picture their amazing performance in honor of Michael Jackson himself in my mind. There are quite a few negative one star and two star reviews of people thinking that this was purely for profit and by Sony nonetheless, but that's simply NOT true. Anyone that claims this album is nothing more than a pitiful attempt to make money from Michael by making remixes of his songs is dead wrong.<br /><br />I listen to this album to sleep to on occasion and it's wonderful to listen to. I only wish I could have seen the performance of the Cirque show myself. If you truly love Michael I highly recommend this to you because I've seen some videos of the Cirque group on Youtube (not specifically of The Immortal show) and they truly are amazing and worth seeing in person. If they do The Immortal show in the U.S again I'd love to go. I'm also a bit disappointed that I couldn't nab the book that was being sold separately from the deluxe and single versions of the album.<br /><br />Again though, if you really love Michael then you'd love Cirque's version of his songs for their performance. They really have done a great job expressing their own appreciation to the one and the only King of Pop and the single greatest entertaining the world has ever seen and will never see again by anyone else.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|It's fun when you're bored.<br />Some of the mini games aren't that fun compared to others but it's whatever and stuff
0307716988|5.0|I absolutely loved reading \\"Moonwalk\\". It gave me a lot more insight as to who Michael Jackson truly is. And how much he'd endured through out his entire life. I learned so much from reading this book. I do have one question; I bought the hardcover, re-released version from I believe 2009 (there's the 1998 copyright and there's one that says 2009) and on page 172 there's a photo opposite the text, could anyone tell me if that photo has drawn images over top of it? The photo is of Michael, Tito, Randy, Jackie, and Marlon. But drawn on the bottom, top right, and top left are of I'm guessing three of the five and right in the top middle is Michael's signature with 1998 written and an arrow with three dots. My question really is though, does anyone that has this particular hardcover version have the same thing for this image on page 173 opposite the text on 172? Please comment and let me know. I'll upload a user image of what it looks like. Thanks.<br /><br />Back to the review; I would definitely if I should have kids one day, I'd read this to them and tell them how amazing and wonderful of a person and entertainer Michael Jackson is, was, and will always be. It's an incredible learning experience. It truly is. If you like knowing someone like MJ better, I'd recommend you start with \\"Moonwalk\\". It'll make you laugh, cry, and say \\"Wow, he did that?\\".
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The title of my review says it all; this is much better than its predecessor! I no longer have a life now that I have this game downloaded...
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Very fun game. I get much joy out of playing this. It is very fun and challenging. More than a walk in the park.<br />.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game it is awesome I think every one who l loves temple run 1 should have temple run 2
0865478570|4.0|As someone who is neither a translator nor fluent in any language other than English, David Bellos' book took me on a wonderfully unpredictable but thoroughly thought-provoking journey through a vast thicket of words, concepts, and languages, both ancient and modern.  For me, the real meat of the book did not begin until Chapter 10- which is why I'm only giving it four stars instead of five.  I thought Bellos was at his best when dealing with the far-ranging theological, political, and cultural implications of the simple fact that literal, word-by-word translation actually obscures the meaning of virtually all original texts (yes, specifically including the Bible). Bellos discusses such questions as whether, if an original text contains a word (for example, a term for a foreign or long-extinct plant or animal) that would be utterly unfamiliar to the second-language reader, the translator should use the unfamiliar name, knowing it would be meaningless to his audience, or instead substitute a more familiar word in an attempt to convey meaning.  I found myself wishing this book were required reading for historians and other scholars who tend to make pronouncements of fact based upon translations/mistranslations of ancient and/or foreign primary sources without considering the possibility that they could be misinformed about what the source originally meant. Bellos also brings much needed attention to the vast gulf between written language and everyday speech - a perspective historians often miss.  \\"Is That a Fish...?\\" is especially well suited for long trips or quiet unbroken stretches when distractions are minimal so the reader can ponder the full ramifications of the theory and practice of translation in understanding our world - both past and present.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Very interesting plot line and story strategy. Recommended, although some took me a while to figure out but the hint bar refill,s fairly fast and is very helpful.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very good challenge game for ten and up. If you are obsessed with horses then this is a good game.... p.s. there are unicorns also...:3
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Tried to store either of 2 cameras and was not able to get a good configuration for either one of them
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Good story.  Easy to follow.  Helpful hints and short time between hints.  I enjoyed playing and look forward to the next one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns to keep you interested til the end. A book club must for all your friends
B006LSZECO|2.0|It took half of the book before there was any clue of a mystery. The language might have shocked someone back in the 1960 . It seemed to be used to cover a lack of talent.It did not compare to M.H. Clark, Patterson and Others
1451695195|4.0|Interesting story about a left-brained doctor who, due to a life-threatening illness, falls into a coma and has a profound near-death experience. His story gave me comfort. His telling of his experience is on the dry side, but he provides compelling evidence for a spiritual dimension.
0307887448|5.0|I'll say upfront that I'm a geek and I grew up in the 70's. I played Joust, Tempest. My bedroom bathed in the glow of those awesome yet awful green monitors. Even if you don't have similar credentials you will love this book! A futuristic yet classic David vs. Goliath tale.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this book was vey good wish suzanne collins had more books to add to the series I was hooked from the first one!!
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I am not much of a old time movie buff but my husband is. I enjoyed this as much as he did.  So glad we watched it.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Really enjoyed this last book! The ending was a bit interesting and slightly confusing but good. Fantastic for the next one!
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This is a great concentracing game.  It's great for the older american, because it keeps you thinking. It's a great game.
B004UOE7VA|4.0|Music is personal. Tastes differ. For me, I liked most of the tracks on this collection. I liked the Daft Punk stuff best.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|I brought it for my niece and we had such fun watching it together.  I enjoyed it as much as see did.  Maybe even more  SHH!! Don't tell anyone.
0618154051|5.0|If you have a die-hard Tolkien fan on your Christmas list, you will make them happy with this one. I gave this as  a gift to the biggest Tolkien fan I know and he was very happy with it.
B004PGO25O|4.0|I liked this book and it's message. You have to actually do the work to get the benefits of the work.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game it is really life like. but it takes a long time to load which I hate. but still give this game four stars!
B004XIZN5M|4.0|Very good progressions for all of the core prison body-weight exercises. Nice looking book too very nicely designed.<br />I don't necessarily agree with the author that body-weight exercises are superior than any kind of weight training or that you'll automatically win every fight if you can do the big six moves. Just because you can do a one arm push-up doesn't mean you can  fight your way out of a wet paper sack. It's all relative. A very interesting book nonetheless.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Several of my photo albums have disappeared and nothing has been done about it.  I went to a lot of trouble to find these pictures and now they're gone.  Can't even talk to a \\"real live person\\" to know if they are ever going to appear again.<br /><br />The App Candy Crush Saga has appeared on my facebook.  I can't use it and I can't delete it.  I didn't ask for it and I would like it to be gone.  I can find nothing that allows me to delete this.  Have contacted Facebook twice and nothing has been done and no explanation given.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love having access to kindle books right on my phone. It works very well and doesn't drain my phones battery all that much either.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I was a big fan from the beginning. This lives up to my expectations and them some. Great disc from start to finish.
0061339202|3.0|I didn't get a lot out of this book. I think it's more for someone in college who could get more out of it for their education.
B0030MM68O|5.0|I love this movie every time I see it! One of the many things our troops do for us that we take for granted.
B00B1P5AH6|3.0|As many others have done, I would have awarded this 4th season five stars, which like all the other seasons of NCIS LA (and of course, NCIS), deserve 5 ++ star-reviews.  But to my astonished disappointment, the fourth season has two episodes (5 + 6, I believe), a continuation series, involving Soviet sleeper agents, and 8 nuclear bombs hidden in eight of our major cities.<br /><br />The suspense only builds by the conclusion of the 6th episode, and clearly without the climatic resolution.  So obviously, the 7th episode should have dealt with the resolution of this national emergent, imminent problem (they're still chasing the villain who wishes to sell the old bombs to highest bidders, who could simply detonate them in place).<br /><br />But guess what, the 7th episode has nothing whatsoever to do with this unresolved, inmminent problem.  It goes off on a completely unrelated tangent, and never returns - as though episodes 5 + 6, had never happened.  UNBELIEVABLE!!!  None of the remaining episodes have anything to do the expected conclusion.  How could an entire cast, crew, writers, et. al,. have overlooked such a glaring absence - did they all simultaneously come down with some amamnesia-inducing virus??<br /><br />As I said, an unbelievablly disappointing oversight in an otherwise brilliantly done series.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|there is no love interest like in most dinsney movies and in most disney movies one or both parents are dead or die, and in this movie everyone lives. it has a great ending and really tells a good moral story about listening to each other.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|NCIS - AS ALWAYS, THE BEST!! Somehow these folks never run out of novel ideas, all extremely well done, where the intriguing plot is often the backdrop to the hunerous and character analyzing reparte.  Each episode is like a mini-novel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game world just fine & is way better the first game ! It's really fun you have to purchase it !
B0058YPL66|5.0|The first season is pretty awesome and spellbinding.I got hooked and cant wait for season 2 to come out on dvd.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Don't read this and then say I don't like this game, not my fault. This game is nice and I played it a lot, then, all of a sudden, it would load and then shut down. Its very stupid and I wish that it would be solved in the next few days.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|I'm sure the movie itself was a fine view. However, I didn't get much of a chance to see it, as the copy that I purchased froze on an increasing frequency, thus preventing one from getting &#34;the picture.&#34; Kudos to Amazon, though, they refunded my cost including the shipping as well as the return shipping.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is Entertaining. This book is different but it is very enjoyable. People should give it a shot. Good read.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Pretty good. Love playing bingo, rarely win without using power ups which those in itself are hard to get too.
0446560065|5.0|Its very funny. My daughter and I laughed like crazy. We relate very well with book as we have three fluffy cats.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very excited to read this book after all of the amazing reviews and chatter it has received. The story starts out strong and intriguing. But as the second part of the book starts the story starts to become bizarre and almost completely implausible. the characters become laughable caricatures of themselves and develop personalities that would qualify them for a mental institution. All of this could have been salvaged however if the ending had provided any sort of closure. I have experienced open ended finales before but this one was just ridiculous.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I LOVED the first temple run. but now the new one blows the first one away... so many new twists and turns and a ziplines and caves. I would HIGHLY suggest this... ugh #obbsessed..
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it's so nice the graphics are great the zip lines are awesome and so is  the mine place. I love how there is just one giant monkey instead of six or seven. I also love  how you can save yourself and be able to collect Jems to save  yourself instead of having to buy them, which you can also do. Two is totally better than one!!! :) I'm just happy that this game was free on kindle fires live playing it! Watch out! There are. Twists and turns that make it not so obvious that you know you'll die.
B0083Z614S|5.0|You are captivated from the moment you start reading.  I could not put it down.  A great classic that everyone must read.
B004SRPXWQ|4.0|It's very cute I'm sure my niece will enjoy it when she comes to visit or spend the night with us
B0098XY5VK|3.0|It is fun but it isn't the full vershion. Wich u have to buy and the money you earn you can't do anything with.<br />This game I would rate at a three.
0670022950|5.0|This book is for serious readers because of the complexities of the subject matter and all of the charts and grafts that run through out this book. Steven Pinker brings these ideas into reality and down to earth, which must have been a very laborous task to accoplish. The one thing that I didn't feel he addressed enough was the issue of Class...but that's proabably another 5-600 pages that has yet to be researched.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun game. very entertaining and has pretty horses. wish gems were easier to get though. definately enjoy it.
0062020897|4.0|I really enjoy every book I've read by Ken Follett because he keeps my attention on subjucts that usually bore me, but he seems to have an amazing way at expressing his ideas/and or complecated storylines.
B0056C6XIA|3.0|not so good quality comparing with Leatherman wave not so well finished looks like somebody built the tools in a hurry, flashlight its ok , case its plastic, locking its not so good, but I hope this tool will not let me down in the woods!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I called myself the SLENDER MAN slayer and I got this game and I tried HARD and pick FOG I won but HE was chasing me and I was SCARED and SAD  SCARY SLENDER MAN game and BEST SLENDER Man game ever on kindle!
B004X5SCY4|5.0|Bonamassa and Hart... You can't go wrong with that collaboration, no need to say how well performed... great covers, great recording and mastering, especially in vinyl.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Love this app! I love that I can see all phases of the moon and it tells me when a full moon.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is spool fun. I play it all the time! in the car my mom yells at me to stop playing because she thinks I am addicted to the game.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|well i have both 1&amp;2 but 2 wont work I played it once :(:(:( _i dontk what to do can some one please help me. I'm berry anoyied
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Very addicting game.  It has 2 bugs to it.  First one is if you do not have a gem to save your life, the game shuts down and you lose all your credits you earned for the run and it deducts the gem(s) from you total gem count.  You can start the next game with a negative gem count.  The second is if you get anywhere near the left side of a rock bridge, you do not slide under it.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Largely set in the clean-looking office of an unnamed Wall Street investment firm, \\"Margin Call\\" offers a dramatized account of how a catastrophic financial collapse begins to emerge. No company is named, but we all know for sure where the film is really set. Written and directed by J.C. Chandor, whose screenplay was nominated for Oscar (Best Writing, Original Screenplay), \\"Margin Call\\" unfolds like a well-made stage play with an excellent cast including Penn Badgley, Simon Baker, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Demi Moore, Kevin Spacey, Zachary Quinto and Stanley Tucci.<br /><br />The film starts with a sudden mass layoff of the firm's employees including Eric Dale (Stanley Tucci), who has been in charge of risk management. In the scene (that reminds us of \\"Up in the Air\\") we sense something is not going well here. Before leaving the office, Eric gives a USB drive to a young analyst Peter Sullivan (Zachary Quinto), warning him to \\"be careful.\\"<br /><br />Late at night Paul manages to complete the task Eric was forced to leave unfinished. We know what he is about to learn. The company is doomed.<br /><br />\\"Margin Call\\" works as a morality tale told against the backdrop of the recent financial collapse we still suffer. You don't have to know much about the financial markets (for those who need a comprehensive analysis of the crisis, there are several documentaries including \\"Inside Job\\"). \\"Margin Call\\" is most effective when quietly describing how the firm's employees and CEO John Tuld (Jeremy Irons) react to the disaster that is inevitable.<br /><br />Perhaps some might think with less subplots (a dying dog episode, for instance), \\"Margin Call\\" would have been slicker and more intense. Still, the director knows what he is doing and he does it very well. With superb acting all around, the film is engrossing and even suspenseful as a drama, even though we know where the story is going.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Pretty fun decent graphics hasn't crashed on me or anything yet but I am not that far into the game yet. The competitions are pretty easy and take a lot of energy.
B0085YNML2|3.0|still playing..hav not made up my mind really<br />ok for free..thats all I have to say about the game sorry
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|This is my second cable in less than 3 years.  It frays easily at the connection point to the Kindle and the the Kindle will not recharge.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have only watched one episode of season 2 so far but the story, writing, acting were all excellent. And the sceanery, inside and out, is beautiful!
B000002KFJ|5.0|I love this one from Sabbath.  The CD is a must for any serious Sabbath fan.  The CD was new still in wrapper, so you are getting a great CD, new, and for a great price.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|How I again hate to admit that I loved this book  - as I did the first one.  My biggest disappointment was when I finished it to find out that the third book had not been published and I'd have to wait until May to see what happens next.
B000002KHH|5.0|I bought this CD just to have it in my collection.  Sometimes I just want to have a tangible CD to hold.  Anyone who loves Black Sabbath needs to have this CD. It's one of the best! Also, this CD was shipped new, still in the wrapper.
B004RL9T50|5.0|This movie is fun for the whole family. The movie has no offensive language or inappropriate jokes. I highly recomend it.
0345803485|5.0|If you're on my Facebook, you'll already know that I have Ryan Reynolds picked out as Mr. Grey.<br />*Pause for swooning*<br />Now, for all the women out there that haven't read it yet, I have to ask you why??? Were you like me and thought it was too much for you? Well, that's judging a book by its' cover at its finest, I think.... especially now.<br />Unless you are a prude, most of the stuff in the book you probably do in the privacy of your home. The rest is fantasy, much like ogres and fairies, yet not as frightful. Stories are supposed to be about imagination and fantasy. At least, the good ones anyway.....<br />The story does have graphic sex scenes, whoopdie doo! It's also a great story about two characters, Mr. Grey and Miss Steele, and their \\"Basic Instinct\\" -like attraction.<br />So please, don't think it's some book of debauchery, though that is involved, but more of a mind game.<br />Give it a chance.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer was a real page turner for me, as I read it in one day while on vacation this week.  I couldn't put it down, reminding me of the days when I first found Grisham's work in The Firm back when it was first released.  I found it to be a truly fascinating story and couldn't wait to get to the end to see how everything fit together.  I just thought it was a great work of storytelling from one of today's best authors.  If you like suspense and a fast paced story, The Racketeer won't disappoint.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this hame is amazing its better than the first one and temple run brave i love it love it love it amazing!!!!!!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I always look forward to the Vince Flynn / Mitch Rapp books and this one didn't disappoint.  I liked the plot and found it kept me interested throughout.  Not the &#34;best ever&#34;, but certainly a very good effort.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|it works looks good stands well so i would recamend it to others stylish and great looks give it a try
B001NHNG64|1.0|First book wasn't great but I like brain twinkies. The second one was so silly I'm done with this author. If you are going to write about a firearms expert maybe you should do a little research.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This movie is great due in large part to Heath Ledger's interpretation of the Joker.  The BluRay HD looks great on our big screen.  I would recommend this to any Batman fan.
034580404X|5.0|I had already read the books before I bought them on here, they were a friends books and I wanted to get my own set so I could read them again.
B008JH5HCW|4.0|Guy Pearce held this movie together. As the hero, he is funny in a smartass sort of way. Damsel in distress is annoying. She loses her cuteness factor fairly early into the movie. Bad guys are fairly bad. Government guys are stereotypical. Some of the action scenes were pretty good.<br /><br />I watched it til the end and never felt like turning it off. So, I must have liked it.
B0086700CM|4.0|A great game- good for sitting in doctors office less annoying and makes everyone wonder what you are doing. Easy controls and not too complex . Made to relax and enjoy.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I rated this game ok, one reason, game is fun when you start out with the coins they give you, But you quickly run out of them, then you only get 1 coin every 20 seconds. You can choose to Buy coins, so unless you want to spend real money on a game, This game is not for you! You have to collect game pieces for a puzzle ... Even though the app is free, I am Not willing to Buy coins to play a game!<br />Not with getting this game!
B008PZ69RU|3.0|This is a film about the relationships of people and how they unknowingly are interconnected in ways that in some cases they will never truly understand. The movie jumps from country to country and person to person throughout the storyline and in some way they are all connected with each other and usually it involves a sexual relationship of themselves or their partner. The film features an all-star cast of international movie stars but even such an honor roll of stars could not save this movie.<br /><br />The movie presentation is choppy and the directing is done in the same manner. The storyline drags in the first half of the movie and it is 40 minutes before Anthony Hopkins makes his first appearance. After Hopkins shows up the film gets gradually better but still not spectacular. The script and storyline are just generic and no real plot ever develops during the movie. It is just bland and the film just seemed flat and uninspired.<br /><br />My wife and I still rated it a 3 star presentation but many people will not like it. The film was better in the second half but it only raised it from a 1.5 to a 3 star rating. I am not sure that I can truly recommend this film and if I were you I would rent it and not buy the DVD.
B0036UMM84|5.0|My favorite movie and was surprised you had it to rent.  I would rent it again, or even buy it this time.
B009MO57H6|3.0|This movie was just OK except for the performance of Milla Jovovich (Alice).  This storyline seems to have lost direction and it has begun to wander a bit.  We have now seemed to move from a very good zombie/virus movie series into a world where the mutations seem to be more alien than anything else.  Milla's fight scenes as usual were spectacular and it made the movie worth watching. The balance of the acting was poorly done and in particular the acting of Seinna Guillory (Jill Valentine) was wooden and just awful.  She looked like she was reading the cue cards.<br /><br />The special effects were worth watching but if this series is going to continue then it is going to need some fresh writing with a real script and other actors beside just Milla to help carry the work load.<br /><br />I gave the film a 3 star rating based on Milla and the fight scenes.  The balance of the movie was just not that good. I suggest that you rent or stream the movie and not purchase the DVD unless you are a real hard core fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing the graphics are far better than the first one.another great thing about it is you can slide down a rope and you can go in a mine and ride in a mine cart.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Besides being erotic and titillating I didn't see a whole lot of a story evolve in this book.<br />Because of my own personal fantasies in sexual domination and bondage I was rushing to turn the pages to see what may be next. I was looking forward to visualizing the acts spelled out on the pages but they never fully materialized for me. To be fair there were some pretty descriptive scenes but it was mainly all anticipation of what may come with no real plot of any kind to beef up the story.<br />Towards the end of the book it started to become repetitive to me and I lost interest so I still need to finish the last 4 chapters.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read it because I wanted to know why it was so popular... well, I still don't know, as if nobody has ever read about sex and the story was crap... didn't like the end either, as if there is going to be a sequence??
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very addictive game. However, I am having major problems getting it to load. Once it opens up it seems to do fine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was not only a heart warming love story, but it was dramatic and suspensefull.  It is rare for a book to cause me to laugh out load and to full out cry and these emotions happened many, many times during the read.  I recommended this as a &#34;must read&#34; to my family and friends that are avid readers.  I don't often re-read a book, but I will Hopeless.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It definitely was a page turner and proved to be suspenseful.  I liked the main characters, although I found the possible explanation of &#34;Jo&#34; the neighbor and/or deceased wife, unsatisfactory, and made it deviate from a love story to a fantasy. Still, I liked it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game takes the best of both Temple Run and Brave and combines them into one exciting and addicting fast- action game.
B005LAII1C|1.0|ted on Blu-ray includes an unrated version of the movie.  it has very foul language and sex jokes... one star!
B00632HWOG|2.0|Too frequently I recieve &#34;Done, with error&#34; messages or Just dune and an empty in box when the drop down screen shows there are a number of unread messages. Additionally, yahoo has become so overloaded with high leve graphics advertising that it simply take to long to get from one piece of mail to the next while I wait for the adertisment to finish loading. I am seriously considering switching to MSN.com for all my internet interests.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|when I got this app it let me play but after I got off I couldn't get back on then I uninstalled cause wen I did that the first time I could play it again but the second time it didn't work and I'm really ticked off cause it is a fun game and I want to play!
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Entertainig but not veryexciting. I would watch it again but only because I already own it. Why do I need four more words?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because feels like your actually training a horse and competing. Also because inlove horses so this like my horse.
B00785P2QC|4.0|not bad for a free app. just wish I did not have to buy credits in order yo build stuff faster.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|well put together game that makes you want to keep playing. it never gets old and it gets you strategical.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|It is a great driver set. Nothing I cannot fix with it, more than enough bits. Will continue to buy iFix it products.
B009CGAMK6|5.0|The music, the orchestra, the voices and the production are top-drawer. I have watched (or just listened) to it so many times; I know every note and every line.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Not worth it the money we paid for it, we could not even get the kids to watch it dont wast your time or money
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Una obra maestra debe estar en la colección de todo entusiasta de los videojuegos, la animación o el anime, muy recomendado !!!
B0061JPYX2|5.0|Arrived on time,I immediately opened it and played the CD.So sorry she had to go from earth so soon.RIP Amy
B0055SWM08|5.0|An engaging puzzle game with calm music and lovely graphics.  my whole family likes to play this. a great challenge
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Arrived on time,I immediately opened it and played the CD.So sorry she had to go from earth so soon.RIP Amy
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Simple and easy to use, just as easy to get addicted!<br />All ages can play and the options of time trials really adds a competitive edge.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Great graphics and conent.  It is a nice upgrade from Temple Run.  Everyone seems to enjoy playing.  It was very easy to learn and play.
B005HSL626|4.0|Love the game. Its for all ages. We have a tournament but lately it has been freezing. Im getting ready to delete it for that reason.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good book. Can't wait to read the next!  This is a excellent series.<br /><br />Would recommend to a friend soon.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I think this is a fantastic app. I like the different clock faces and being able to pick songs you would like to wake up to or use the sleep timer on. It would be great on trips! The dimmer is great and the lowest setting is not that bright, like some people complain about.
B008XG1X18|5.0|..... And I've never been happier!! I love this app, it allows me to explore quickly and pinning is easy! I like the app on my iPad mini better than my phone though. Overall, it's awesome.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|If you're having a bad day, just fire up Tom and he'll have you laughing again. I love his sqeaky voice and being able to record the videos and upload them to fb or send them via email. If you try to talk too fast it doesn't grab all of the words. My daugher's apple app runs a lot better on her ipod touch.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite game to play. it relaxes me and is very easy to play. Give you different options to choose from.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I am not the smartest person when it comes to games but this one is very easy for me. I can see how it's supposed to go and can whip through many puzzels in a short amount of time. It keeps me on my toes.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Love these types of games! This one is especially good. Very well done with good graphics and a free bonus chapter after you solve the game.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This one seems kind of boring to me, like the cat better. Just a personal preference I guess. The voice is deeper and just doesn't seem as funny.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|great game to relax your mind. I play before I go to sleep at night. easy to learn and quite addictive.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|It takes forever to get to the meat of the story.There is a lot of boring stuff about wild versus animals in captivity,and bunches of boring stuff about religion.I would'nt recommend it to anyone
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Couldn't stop for 4 hours<br />! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B006LSZECO|4.0|I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a story with a twist. It kept me reading from start to finish in one sitting.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I understand the purpose of the game.  But is there a limit on the levels you can reach?  How can you start a new game?
B008LD09LS|4.0|I've had the AR.Drone 2.0 2 full days using a Galaxy SIII and Kindle Fire.  Control with the Kindle is tougher as it's acellerometer isn't as precise.  Scared first night as it woudn't go above 18 inches, looked to be setup.  USE ABSOLUTE MODE!!!  Much better for beginners.  It isn't default on.  Altitude control isn't nearly as stable as I was hoping, but not dangerous.  Expect to take a while to be as good as the videos.  Looking forward to the time to learn.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|I those a five star because it's very funny and I disliked one or two  parts Cristina I will tell my friends
B003O86FMW|4.0|I was too excited to read this book after the first one. I can't believe the Capitol is so cruel! Again, they are proving their power. Collins did a great job on this one! Following the adventure and love of Katniss and Peeta had me glued to this book. I had jury duty while reading it and the time went by so fast after sitting in the room for 6 hours doing nothing. I give 4 stars because at times, the book is slow and boring, but it has a lot of vital information and picks up where the 1st left off. It speeds up and has a bang of an ending. The ending forces you to immediately get the 3rd. Most definitely a great trilogy. If you have an imagination and need a good read, get this!
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|my 21 month old loves dr panda, he can sit down for a period of time and play this game. while learning and watching things unfold in don't of him. highly recommended
B007V2UGPE|5.0|At version 3 the graphics have improved a lot and it doesn't crash anymore.  If you like tower defense game this one is very good
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is great. It is very smooth and works well on my kindle fire hd. I found the first version to be very boring and plain. I like this new version because of turns, the coal mines, and the the different obstacles. If I did have to change on thing I would have different landscapes because there is only the forest and the main brick roads.
B003VANOFY|5.0|The headset has the best form of wireless-ness without a bulky adapter or power outlet thing. All you need is the USB clip and the headset and the USB Wire to charge it. The connection is amazing since it can work through walls around my house from a 30 foot radius until it'll start losing signal because of the walls. The headset wraps around the ear and is very cushiony, but since the edges aren't made of permeable foam (like the turtlebeach z11's) my ears tend to heat up every now and then. The headset worked on my PC right from the start (windows was doing the &#34;installing this device&#34;...&#34;this device is ready to use&#34;) and it even works on my galaxy s3 with a usb connector (except that the buttons don't work). It's a great headset and the side buttons are truly useful for scrolling through music and pausing/playing as you do stuff around your room. They also have a bit of noise cancellation for vacuuming which is even better :3
B008KYOCA2|2.0|Maybe it was me but it wouldn't let me enter new events. Not impressed. Really don't know why its so hard to create a calendar that works. My 4 year old walmart phone has a better planner.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you loved the  50 shades books then the Crossfire series is right up your alley as well! I can't wait to read book 2!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Hands down the most frustrating game ever! But I'll be darned if I don't spend hours playing this thing! The laws of physics and gravity are completely thrown out the window but just aim a little higher and mass destruction! Awesome!
B008XG1X18|5.0|this has turned out to be one of the best places to keep my craft ideas, patterns ad shopping lists, it's wonderful to have a place with pictures and direct links, no more guessing where a bookmark is or where it will lead to 6 months later.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|no frills calculator. Kind of like the one on windows. Just you basic operations. Works very well for everyday use.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I found this game to be fun and challenging not only do I love it but I have also gotten all of my friends and family in on it as well

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app so much because I can upload my notes into a free cloud!I recommend this app if you want to write something important down.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Preston and Child and read the reviews of their last book with some trepidation...wondering whether they were going to &#34;pull a Tom Clancy&#34; and lose their muse after a wonderful series of Pendergast stories. This novel is back in the groove with multiple parallel subplots, fascinating character development and fast pacing. Sure, as usual it requires a bit of suspension of disbelief, but that's exactly why I read for pleasure. You will not be disappointed.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book. What could you say about something so touching. I loved every minute of reading. My best friend has had a terminal illness since she was in 5th grade. She is a fighter. And will continue to be. I strongly urge that you read this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is probably the most brilliantly book I have ever read. John Green is such an inspirational author, and I had actually cried while reading. Well done John Green
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Excellent app.  I like the ability to download more sounds for free, adding to the already decent selection.  Well done.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I love this movie because is part of Alien movie universe, the visual effects are super-spectacular and the story is intriguing
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Funny lil Irish guy kicking butt and collecting coins and clovers :) Reminds of playing Mario bros. Looks oldshool just like it but its addictive.
B003Y5H5F6|3.0|Not the best of Underworld series, I found the movie short but very entertainment, I think this movie is for fans only !!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Ok you can probably tell I love dragons by my username. This game is the most awesome game eva!!! Much better than Tap Dragon Park. There was a bug where it force-closed on me in mid-play, but I got over it. I am hooked on this game so much that I bred the rare Seasonal, Silver, and Sakura dragons! Just. Awesome. Enough said :)
B005LAIHPY|5.0|This movie is great, the visual effects are amazing and very entertainment, Rihanna is not a good actress but she look sexy !!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Good reading. I loved the twists and turns in the<br />story.  It was difficult to the book down. Love the story!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The Blu-Ray transfers of all 4 movies are fantastic! If you are a Home Theater Enthusiast, then you must own this. You already know how you feel about the actual movies, so the only thing to be concerned with is how the Blu-Rays perform in a Home Theater setting. I've had this collection for a couple of months, and I can say that the Blu-rays do not disappoint in video or sound.
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|Perhaps that I'm not a fan of British production but I found this average at best.  A friend of mine recommended it and I only kept reading the book in hopes for that standout scene in the book that makes the slowness of it worthwhile.  I didn't get that.<br /><br />The book is written the way the book was written for a purpose and I understand that.  It's just that literature like this isn't for me.<br /><br />I expected more from the Queenie story.<br />I expected more revelations from his &#34;pilgrimage&#34; whereas I don't feel like it was there.  I just think it gave him time to think and go a little cuckoo for a while.<br /><br />I wouldn't read it again.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is classic movie making by one of the masters of the craft. Even if Part 3 is not your cup of tea, the first two volumes are more than worth the price of this collection. Just buy it, enjoy it, and thank me later.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Normally soccer mom book chatter isn't my thing, but I gave into curiosity and read the book.  I had a love/hate relationship with this; well mainly with Christian.  It got to the point that I was tired of them having sex.  Every other paragraph was another session and I was like...enough already.  These people have more sex than anyone should be allowed!  But I saw what the hubub was about and continued onto book 2....
B004KKXMSI|4.0|These movies were by far the best remastered movies to make the blu-ray switch out of all my collections, honestly thought that Sam Neil was face to face with a velociraptor!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|And this is how a movie can easily be made!  By book three I was enthralled with Anastasia and Christian.  It was jam packed with action (not THAT kind) and I couldn't put it down!
B0053FANS6|4.0|Nothing like old movies getting revamped in high def, the first two movies are worth it alone and the third one is more family friendly, but in my opinion, a little too much. Good trilogy overall!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Excellent detail in this book and very interested to have the child as narrator.  I bought the Kindle version so I rarely viewed how much more of the book I had.  Needless to say, I was very disappointed when I saw it was over!<br /><br />I get it...the full circle thing.  But I was wanting MORE.  How did Jack develop into his life?  I wanted detail of Ma's courtroom meeting.....just more...and I feel like there was that opportunity for the story to do that.
B008JFC6F0|4.0|Cant wait to see them live. They have sold out shows everywhere! Just kids from Perth, Australia. Their first album is great.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I was born in 1984 and the most of the 50's/60's I know of came from history classes and family photos.  It was interested to get a real look at what it was like to live life in that time every single day; not just stories or dates that punctuated history.<br /><br />Starting into the book I thought it was kind of cheesy....but as it went on it was intriguing.  You just knew things were going to go horribly as he went against Al's rules and really did not lay low!  He did things that really change peoples' lives....<br /><br />However I do still have unanswered questions such as: why did Al want so desperately for the narrator to go back and do this?  I was expecting some tie in with Al and WHY he cared so much.  Also, WHY did Jake continue on?  Did he really care whether or not Kennedy was assassinated?  Did he really feel so obligated to Al?  I must say there were plenty of times that I would have just bowed out....especially just taken Sadie and bowed out (but who knows what that would have done).<br /><br />The middle of the book got a little long while Jake was spying on Oswald.  I'm still not sure why he did this and for so long?  There were only one, maybe two, questions he needed answered.  Everything else was detailed in Al's notes and in  American history.<br /><br />Overall, good.  I'm glad I read it.  It gave this 28 year old a new eye into a different part of life that my parents and grandparents experienced.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a good solitare game and even better that it was FREE! I enjoy playing it a lot. Also like the choices of how many suits can be played.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the book that made me not only like but fall in love with Christian.  You understand so much more and you see that Anastasia is truly the one who has the power in this relationship.  Be careful!  After reading this I was wanting  divorce because I was convinced that I needed and could have a man just like Christian.  lol  Kidding but.....seriously!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Stupid monkey LOVE THE APP hate the monkey it's HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!! and it has this wheel that has spikes on it. and at the begging there's a rope wild thing:)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it like entering in competitions<br />it is awesome!when you play with your horse you fall in love with him
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. the graphics are awesome. I haven't stopped playing since I got it...... my daughter also loves horses and enjoys playing it as well. keep the good games going.
0380515326|5.0|This book takes you on a journey and it's a wild ride. It is slow read, but engrossing! I first read the readers digest abridged version somewhere around Junior High era and then re-read the full version later from the library. I love the characters and how realistic the story is. I love how the author marries history and fiction, and in this book it's a really great union. This book is the story of the west, at the time it was the last great frontier. It tells of the progression from stage coach to train, from the eyes and mind of a stage coach driver, and so much more. It truly is a classic and I wish it were available in digital format so I would never lose it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|fun for my 4yrold wish it could read the stuff to her. she really has enjoyed it. sometimes locked up on my kindle.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this game. In fact, whenever I beat all the puzzles, I clear data and start it again!
B008JFUTT0|4.0|\\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" was made by first-time Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul about the quest by two South African music fans to find out what happened to a hero of their youth, an American musician called \\"Rodriguez\\" who made two folk-rock albums in the 1970s, then was rumored to have died by suicide. Stephen \\"Sugar\\" Segerman wrote some liner notes for the 1996 re-release of Rodriguez' second album \\"Coming from Reality\\" (1971) on CD. Though Rodriguez had been immensely popular in 1970s South Africa and an inspiration to the anti-apartheid and Afrikaans music movements, no one there knew any more about him than was written on the album cover. With little to go on, Segerman asked for information in his liner notes. South African music journalist Craig Bartholomew-Strydom, also an avid fan of Rodriguez, took up the challenge and tried to track down information on Rodriguez through the supply chain for his albums.<br /><br />The two men would both have success, but the project would turn out very differently that they had imagined. That's what makes \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" so compelling. It's a surprising, almost magical story that could not have happened in today's internet-connected world. Nevertheless, it did happen a short time ago, and it's a real crowd-pleaser. The film has a great soundtrack too, featuring fourteen of Rodriguez' original songs, including \\"Sugar Man\\", the song of the title. This is one of those rare films that will send people straight out to buy the soundtrack. Director Malik Bendjelloul worked on a shoestring budget and even shot some scenes with his iPhone, doing the illustrations and editing himself. After four years of work on the film, he ran out of money and was at risk of leaving an unfinished project. But now the film is a minor hit and nominated for an Academy Award. There's a bit of fairy tale in that story too.<br /><br />Though its director may have been inexpert, \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" is well-constructed, engaging and inspiring. It does leave some questions lingering, however: Rodriguez was also a big hit in Australia and toured there in 1979 and 1981. He played to sixteen sold-out concert halls. The film doesn't mention that. And why did Sussex Records drop Rodriguez before his third album was completed if the albums were selling well in other parts of the world? The producers of his first two albums were disappointed by US sales, but did they not know that foreign sales were respectable? The explanation may be that sales did not exist in Australia or South Africa until the mid-1970s, by which time Sussex Records was out of business. Was part of the confusion over the success of these albums abroad and over royalties due to the fact that Sussex Records folded in 1975? \\"Searching for Sugar Man\\" focuses on the South African story.<br /><br />The DVD (Sony 2013): The only bonus feature is a theatrical trailer. Subtitles for the film are available in English SDH and French.nspiring. It does leave some questions lingering, however: Rodriguez was also a big hit in Australia and toured there in 1979 and 1981.

B004LWZW9C|4.0|love the movie... came in good shape but over priced.  my daughteer and her friends watch it all the time
B009IEXKXI|3.0|The Martian was easy read, although I did get tired and skipped thru all the mathimatical calculations. To much technical stuff..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really good game and that it is a must have app. I recommend this game for everybody.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This app took me 45 min to download. No joke. It was pretty annoying, but it was worth it. This game is so fun!<br />:-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Way better than the first game and more of a challenge for the mind.  I like that you don't know what's coming next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great game and cute helper he is adorable I love him great game again and it is a lot like having a horse and I would know
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I was interested in this book after seeing the trailer for the upcoming film.  Young adult series are not my normal pick from the library.  Love Harry Potter but despise Twilight.  But this book blends angel, demons, werewolves, vampires, and magic in to an enjoyable tale that is difficult to put down.
B004ZA9HB4|5.0|Nice product works as promised.  love the interface. great at playing media.  Would definitely recommend to others.  Pick it up.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I rented this movie to decide if it was good enough to buy, and I ended up watching it three times in two days because it was so good!  The lines were hilarious and the singing was fun, even if it was totally pre-recorded singing.  You should watch/buy/rent this movie!!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Erin's vivid description made me feel like I was part of the circus.<br />It was hard to put the book down, there was always another pathway or tent waiting to be explored on the next page.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|It used a lot of the bits up on my kindle fire. The game took 5 hours to load itself. So I had to delete it before it used up more space. When I tryied to open it just would not open. DON'T GET THIS APP IT TAKES UP TOO MUCH SPACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game gives you practice without losing cash fun times galore.  A nice game yo pass away your day with.
B004S9AK9U|4.0|It's a good story, and very sad. Saw the movie, but i liked the book better, all round a good read.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|The Greatest Band of all time...Led Zeppelin!<br />This is a must have for any Led Zeppelin or classic rock fan
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Horrible. Worst game there is way different stuff then the original one. Also hate the zip lines and just one monkey
B009NQKPUW|4.0|It leaves a great 'grab' for a sequel.  Watched it twice during the rental period.  Once on my Kindle and once on my computer.  Could not get it to work on my I-Pad.  I do recommend it, especially for those who have followed all the other Alien movies.
B001TD1XWG|2.0|good beats. repetitive lyrics. more like rock-rap with minimal rap. i was looking for great lyrics and a faster verse showing rap skill.
B00006CXSS|4.0|The show itself is excellent and worthy of 5 stars.  I took one star away from this set though because it has no English SDH options (often the French and Spanish subtitles show up without warning, though that may be a problem with my cheap player).<br /><br />Since my hearing is beginning to fade, it would be nice if a future release had this added.<br /><br />Edit: It's come to my attention that some people have suggested turning on the closed captions on the TV.  While it is not as good as English SDH subtitles, the CC is at least watchable.  (Aesthetically, it's less pleasing, but it's watchable now).<br /><br />I still think it deserves being docked a star for not having the option on the disc menu
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I thought this book was awesome. I have read book 1,2,and 3 I want to read the whole series.this book rocks
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Good writing that sets the scenes well, describes events as seen by the main character at different points in his life.  Shows the way this character kept the events of childhood and of growing up from taking over his life as an adult.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I like this app.  I do wish you could look up all words, but there are some that you cannot if you are not a paying member, that was disappointing to me.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|can't wait for part 2! superman and the joker, plus Batman's army! Female robin is kinda weird though, haha, but great movie overall.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game. I really like the storyline and the graphics are amazing. Well worth the money. Just challenging enough to keep you wanting more.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really love this game. There are many pros and very few cons.<br /><br />The graphics are gorgeous. The first few times I played, I kept dying because I kept trying to watch the screen. The power ups are improved too, since when the meter gets full you can tap twice for a power up. I think there is more gold per thousand meters too which helps you with gathering gold. I also like the missions, the way they did it is a little more motivating to keep playing. They also added a neat part where you ride a cart through a cave.<br /><br />The characters are less though, they only have four. And my game kept closing randomly without saving my game but I don't know if it was just my kindle.
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|Brilliant book, great read, hard to put it down.  I love the mystery and the intrigue it represents to its readers.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Better than the original. I will not waist words or your time. Get the game.... fun and addictive. Easily worth the price. Really. Do it. You will not be sorry.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was very pleased with this book. I can't wait to read the last one  I rate it a five stars
B0060D123K|5.0|Always a great holiday movie. Steaming quality is perfect no hiccups or slowdowns. No cons or drawbacks to getting to amazon instant
B0067Q42BY|4.0|enjoying the puzzles....doing the quest. some had complained about ads, but i am not seeing much of any. though i haee only started the game up once and have been playing thru.  i like it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Very good and the last time I had to be a bit of a jerk to be a good thing
1603580557|5.0|Thinking in Systems is one of my frequent re-reads. Donella's thinking was structured by the domain she became an expert in. She has succeeded to leave with us her thought elegance in such a relevant domain of modeling as systemic modeling.<br /><br />Many undervalue simplicity of expression; however, that never happens with true specialists - simplicity in explanation is the pinnacle of knowledge.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|They are hard to find and very few keep you interested.  This is a fun bingo game.  Goes at a nice pace.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Kept me guessing to the very end<br /> Best book ever<br />And I can not wait for the fourth book to come out I have no doubt in my mind that it will be just as good if not better
B009JBZH54|5.0|It's fun watching them three nights in a row.  So many more details remain fresh in your mind.  Great movie nights!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have some little quirks where certain noises really interrupt my concentration during the day and found myself wearing earplugs, which is very impractical.  So when I saw this app, I decided to download it.<br /><br />It is outstanding!  The sounds are all very high quality and there is a good variety so you can easily find one to match your needs.  The most surprising was the Tibetan bowl sound.  I happened to have a headache when scrolling through and this sound started playing.  I wasn't going to leave it on that sound but then noticed my headache had gone away instantly!  I've tried it a few more times since then and it works every time.  I highly recommend this app for anything from going-to-sleep sounds, baby soothing, relaxing and yes, even headaches :)<br /><br />I haven't had any popups asking for reviews like another reviewer mentioned.  If I had to choose a \\"con\\" about this app, I'd say that I find it very inconvenient to have to force close the app in order to stop using it, rather than it having an on/off button.<br /><br />*Note- I use this on my Google Nexus 7 tablet and on my Kindle Fire (original) and it works great on both.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|Great watch, easy to operate after minimal review of directions. GPS captures signal quickly. Smaller size makes it easy to wear, doesn't feel clumsy on and screen is easy to read.
B0006N2EZ0|4.0|I liked this movie a lot the music was off the hook. Witney's performance was a very good loved her in this.
B009ERK1T0|4.0|Definitely one of Deftones' better albums. My album did arrive on time, but the center piece that holds the disc in the tray was broken. No big deal though.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Although the action and the F/X are very good and I liked most of the perfomances. I found that the story was lacking.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I enjoy the show Big Bang & do not have time to watch it during the week.  I purchased this Season 1-5 bundle as it was cheaper than purchasing individually.  I was surprised that there are scenes not on the television.  I have watched the 1st 2 seasons and have found the quality of the DVD good.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I paid for it on Kendel so I had thread it.  Did to like the book and finished all of them.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I am totally in love with this show... Well written and cases presented are so interested that I cannot wait to see more... Great actors and real world Manhattan stories... Great, great, great... I hope it's not over soon....
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Beautiful graphics and increasingly difficult puzzles make this game addictive. I'm afraid I'll finish all the puzzles in each level too soon!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is what a bookshould be like!!! keep u trapped until you read all the collection<br />......unlike some trash out there *cough twilight cough*
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Christopher Nolan does it again. The entire cast was A+. Why this movie didn't get an academy award just proves why these award shows don't reflect what the consumer likes. None-the-less a must see...several times over!
B003O86FMW|5.0|After Harry Potter i had a hard time finding a collection that would keep me interested. LL 3 BOOKS OF THE HUNGER GAMES ARE AMAZING!!! (MOM APPROVED)
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't generally write reviews, and I never really put a lot of weight into the book reviews since every reader is so different.  I will usually read a few of the shorter reviews, and then get a general idea of the how well the book is liked by getting a ratio of the four and five star reviews to the overall number.  At the time that I am writing this, Wool currently has 3355 four and five star ratings out of 3504 total reviews (Overall average of 4.8 stars).  To me, that is a damn good ratio that deserves to at least have my attention enough to download and read the sample.  The ratio was pretty close to the same when I read Wool 1, although I believe the number of reviews was less than 1000 at the time.<br /><br />I had downloaded the first Wool, and found that it was more than enough to grip me, and I immediately bought the Omnibus.  Wool 2 took me a little longer to get through, I found it to be plodding.  An old woman and the silo deputy climb slowly down hundreds of flights of stairs. (\\"Why isn't there a frickin' elevator!\\"  I kept asking myself.)  It wasn't until later that I realized that the monotonous scene of going up and down the silo stairs was intentional.  It gives the reader an understanding of how huge the silo is, and how difficult transportation and communication is for the people that live inside of it.  Howey could have just said that climbing from the top of the silo to the bottom, and then back again was a harrowing task, but instead he chose the show it.  To make the reader feel it and understand it in a way that few writers have the ability to do.  At the end of Wool 2, we get to meet Juliette, which is a character that I'm not likely to ever forget.  From what I have read of Hugh's background, I don't think he's ever done any maintenance or mechanical work, but he nails Juliette.  From her dedication to completing a job, to the individual triumph she gets from doing the job well, I was able to identify with and like Jules right from the start.<br /><br />Aside from the great descriptive narration and rich characters, Hugh Howey is a story-weaver of epic proportions.  The plot pieces fit together like an intricate puzzle.  The Shift series prequel that comes after the Wool Omnibus answers many questions and introduces even more interesting characters and twists that make me believe that Howey is some type of genius for how he's managed to lay it all out. This story and these characters are ones that will stick with me for a long time - to me that is what makes a book outstanding enough to deserve a five star rating.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read the Wool Omnibus.  It's an incredible value and story that is well worth a re-read too.  I usually have no less than ten books waiting to be read at any given time on my Kindle, but Hugh's books always make their way to the top as soon as I can get them, and the Wool series is one that will be on my re-read list forever, and with all the books out there that I have to read, my re-read list is very short.  Keep them coming Hugh!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book gives a great narrative of what it takes to become a SEAL and the life involved.  Thank God for the guys that do this type of work.

B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids are constantly using this app.  It is like virtual legos...they love building/crafting their sites.  Our only complaint is:  my son insists that it sometimes changes his create mode to survival mode.  He may be making the mistake in how he is saving the game, but he says it has happened twice.  Tears both times, but it does force him to keep creating...it may be desigened that way.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|This was a excellent television series but be aware it only lasted one season so buy a used copy if you can.

B005RAO0GS|5.0|Florence and the Machine is by far the best band ever. BUY THIS CD - you will not regret it. :)
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I couldn't wait for the new John Corey book. The others were fantastic. But this one is just so....boring! Nothing happens! And he just wraps up the ending by telling you what happened instead of showing you how it happens. Almost like he got bored with his own book and phoned in the last couple of chapters. Really, I want a refund.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This book is a wonderful thriller that makes you think about what goes on in DC. Baldacci is a master with this type story.... never a dull moment. Please never stop writing Mr. Baldacci.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|A page turner and an ok story, but the writing is pretty bad. There's so much gasping you would think someone is going to pass out.
B006IGZWB2|2.0|Simple, I don't like films that deal with race.<br />I am a white woman who was raised by a black nanny whom I loved dearly.  I don't want to see this type of film because it upsets me.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a great game with pretty good graphics. They have taken out some of the characters and changed the way you navigate the game. It has lots of new obstacles and scenery. Great game overall!!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this app A LOT would've given it 5 stars but it closed on me three times and I barely got it yesterday :( other than that it was awesome!
B008NW67E0|5.0|This group, especially this album, has ruined me. I literally cannot listen to any other music for more than a couple songs before playing Babel from start to finish. These guys are in a league of their own. I'm fairly certain I will never enjoy a group's music more than I enjoy Mumford & Sons.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The boring book you may ever read<br /> Then again I do not require it no children should not read this
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Movie was Cheap with all three blu ray, DVD and digital copies. Was worth buying since not all the room at home have blu ray players
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I gave this book an &#34; I Hate It&#34; rating because I got so sick of reading variations of &#34;my heart was pounding in my chest&#34; over and over. I slogged through about half of it and gave up. The girl is a not a believable or likable character and seems to have nothing on her mind but this one fascination with the boy. The boy is cast as a all knowing, all things under control guy years beyond his age acting like he is noble and upright. That is hard to swallow.<br />If the author eventually developed the characters I couldn't see any signs of it in the first 47% of the book. Perhaps it was written for hormone loaded teenagers but  that might be insulting teenagers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Really cool app to pass the time. Lots of awesome games to play and unlock. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />P.S. I'm reviewing for more points to spend.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I dolwand it for my daughter and my sons they loved it it more fun woo please get it. and I'm never detle people who gave it bate it you crazy

B00005JMFQ|5.0|I can't tell you how much my boyfriend and I love this movie and now we can watch it whenever we want. The DVD is in great condition. It came to my house before the due date.
0385344333|5.0|I can't post anything bad about Reacher.....you see I am in love with Reacher. Lee Child is my favorite author.....the BEST..

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Vintage John Grisham.  I have read all of his books and am gald to say that he has stepped his game up.  An excellent read.
1609611543|5.0|It has lots of recipies and I have been useing  it to learn more about the flour's and trying to work out a good eating bread,
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read most of Tom Clancy books.  He too tends not to disappoint. I also appreciate how he puts you into what is really happening in the world of esponiage.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love saving and organizing my different interests on boards on Pinterest. It's so much fun to explore my current interests by browsing through other's similar likes. I can then follow one or all of their boards to keep updated with what they discover on my personal feed. If I need a Paleo Diet Recipe, I can search other users on Pinterest to be inspired by their recipes they've posted on their boards. Having this app on my phone gives me a gateway into a very visually appealing world which I love.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|I always enjoy insight on why or how the brain guides our behavior. This book not only explains it but equips us with the tools to change it on a personal, social or corporate level.<br />Great read! I've recommended it to others  already.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|The price was hard to believe, but so low I gave it a shot. The batteries got here when promised and matched the image. So far they seem to work very well (I've put 4 of them to work to date). I don't know about the life of the batteries yet, but will provide an update later. Otherwise, only great things to say about this very low cost solution and the service from this vendor.<br /><br />Update: I use these in small but bright LED lights on my bike for when I'm riding in darkness, which is usually when I start before the sun comes up. As such I turn them off after it gets light and put my bike away. That is the plan anyway... 6 days ago I put the bike away but forgot to turn off my back light. I just realized it as I was prepping my bike for another early ride tomorrow. Though LEDs are pretty easy on batteries, the fact that it was still glowing after 6 days speaks to the quality of the batteries even though it had dimmed noticeably. So I'm reiterating my 5 star rating...and buying 5 more!
B00005AFVR|5.0|I have seen this concert many times on VH1 Classic and after finally seeking out the CD I was not disappointed. The audio is great and really captures the performance as well as featuring bonus tracks not shown on television. This is a great buy for any Springsteen fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never read a magical book or a more special book in all my life, although some parts are a little rough for some kids.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Awesome Book. What an inspiration of strength and the spirit of within in order to survive. Yet disturbing of how her abducted lead this life undetected
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Very easy to play, child and adult alike. Only problem with it is that acorns are hard to get. I refuse to buy things from a game that is free. I get lots and lots of coins but next to no acorns. But I still play. OH WELL!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless made me cry and laugh out loud. The subject matter is heartbreaking, but many of the moments are hilarious.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I say this is a really great game. Wish the energy refill was faster!!Other than that I love this game.
B00AW0KGYI|1.0|I have read all the books, own all the movies, except for Breaking Dawn 2 and will be owning that when it is release. However, I would be out of my mind to purchase another DVD with eight additional minutes! Talk about greed!!! This DVD needs to go back into the vault!
1416905014|5.0|I gave this to my granddaughter for Christmas and she was soooo excited.  She absolutely loved it. Reminds me.  Maybe I should buy her another one.
B000PXUA5W|4.0|I purchased two of these for my niece and nephew for Christmas.  They both seemed to like them.  I think they would be great for any lego lover child!!!
0761169431|5.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift. He was very excited to receive it. Perfect to make a kids mind work and what they can do with just a piece of paper. Great book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is fun and it kills time I definetly garentee that its worth getting so u should buy it
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I use wikipedia almost daily and so I was happy to make a contribution to their operations. I will be happy to do so annually.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I have the tape and needed an upgrade.That should be enough except to say the songs still give me chills 15 years later.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie about the song Amazing Grace and I am so glad that I bought this movie to have in my library of movies.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I heard about this sequel before I downloaded it and while I heard positive reviews, I find' t think it could be better or even as good as the first one. But when I finally played it, I realized that I was wrong. This sequel was perfectly created, well at least as perfect as anything can be.  It is somewhat more challenging, but it's the fun kind of challenging. Love this game, it's an awesome sequel.
B000HKYOK0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching these old episodes again I had forgotten how much fun they are to watch. I only wish there were more.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I never heard of this game before until I downloaded it. I am glad I gave it a chance. It is surprisingly very fun and you can become addicted to it after awhile. I totally recommend this game.
B005FISBTO|5.0|There isn't much to say, either the discs worked or they didn't.<br />All the discs worked :))<br />Good season.<br />Sadly Dexter is over.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's has better graphics than original and new obstacles which makes it better than original. Also like how they changed it from demon monkeys to mega demon monkey.
B00003CXB4|5.0|My children loved to watch it and now my grandson loves it. I also enjoy watching it, great sing a long songs.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I JUST LOVED THE MOVIE, SO NOW I HAVE THE VIDEO !!I CAN WATCH IT ANYTIME I WANT NOW THANK YOU!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I felt the author laid the words on the page to keep you engrossed in the book from cover to cover. You felt the pain the desperation the joy of the characters and it was exhilarating. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves reading.
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game is a brilliant book, taking place in the future when all of humankind is engaged in war. The military has grown desperate - mustering up its very best against a threatening alien species. The only hope for humanity lies in mere children, military geniuses bred for one purpose alone - to command the war against the \\"buggers\\" jeopardizing our survival.<br /><br />Ender Wiggin is one such child, conceived so as to not only have a superior intelligence, but also a ruthless nature and a compassionate heart. However, these two traits conflict with each other, leaving Ender with an internal struggle that may prove to be a bigger challenge to face then the external threat of aliens. As he himself says, \\"In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.\\" This dilemma, along with other themes Card includes, capture the essence of human nature, as well as questions what it means to be human at all.<br /><br />This gripping sci-fi story of friends who are not friends and enemies who are not enemies is a definite recommendation to those interested in the genre, but really anyone can enjoy this superb book. It contains heart-stopping action and mind-blowing plot-twists, with the only negative being that it kept me up all night thinking about it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very good book. I have read all his books and this one was as enjoyable as all the others. I always look forward to his next story.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|Almost exactly the same game-play as Super Mario Brothers. Tubes you jump down, buttons (coins) you gather, enemies you stomp, an underwater world where you transform into a submarine. Even stage you jump on at the end of every lever, via Super Mario  3. The similarities are endless. But, being a Mario fan, this game is GREAT! Beautiful graphics! &#60;3 More levels, please!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When this game first came out the world was obsessed with it. people paid big money towards this game. I never thought their could have been other ones better than the usual one ..but I changed my minds days ago when I purchase this app. Temple run has outdone itself.  this game is awesome!<br />  Ashley153
B006O3MU96|4.0|Excellent app that everyone should own. Fun whether you're bored or not. What I don't care for is the fact that you cannot delete players from the roster. Otherwise, I haven't had any issues as of yet.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|entertaining movie takes a different twist on the iconic President of the United States of America and my friend and I enjoy it
B00884GR0W|4.0|I love this game. I always am anticipating every update because they always bring awesome stuff. When multiplayer comes out, I won't be able to stop playing this game. Its a must have if you are really wanting to have a more in depth adventure where your char can grow with exp from your travels, you just gotta see for yourself I can't wait for future updates its only going to get better. It takes block games in a better direction
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I like Colin Farrell, but this movie was a waste of time and money.  It is essentially a high tech remake of the classic with the addition of one long shoot out.  They changed the movie from one with a plot to essentially a chase scene from begining to end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves it because she has always wanted a real horse and this is the closest thing I could find. It is simple for her ( she is 8) and best of all it is free!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is fantastic! Absolutely everything I need for all the alarms and reminders that I need it for. Best one of about 5 I've tried! Thanks!
B000002KDO|5.0|The early years of Black Sabbath were certainly their best and Master of Reality is a metal gem throughout the entire album.  This is the roots of metal as we know it today!!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Wow. It downloaded quickly, was easy to set up on the computer and runs quite smoothly. Amazing. I don't think I've tried any other app that connects to my computer so well. There is a tiny bit of lag time but it probably depends on the internet speed connection - I have the second cheapest package available. I totally would recommend this app to others - especially if you got it when it was the free app of the day.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|I love 70's guitar rock and this album is one of my favorites.  Blazing guitars, softer songs, a great mix of 70's rock.  UFO is a great band, and this is their greatest album!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This is a fun but very easy HO game to play. The storyline is interesting and has nice graphics. Minus 1 star because the game is too easy - very short playtime.
B009CPJHY4|2.0|A big disapointment because your service did not provide closed captions as the web site indicated it would.  We were misled and should not have to pay for the service.  The movie was probably quite good.  The service was very poor.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|well first it would let me play and then everytime i opened it it would just go right back to my home screen and now it wont let me re install it after i uninstLlled it. im disapionted
B009GXHOW4|5.0|look can you please make this app free i really want to spawn a mob in my greenhouse on minecraft but i can only do it on pro but  i just want it to be free. but you don't have to make pro free forever, just about a week or so because i really want to do what i said in the last sentence. so can you please make pro free for just a little while?!  :(
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Hope it would ease my daughter's fear of the dr.s... it hasn't but she still loves playing it (I'm guilty of playing it sometimes too haha!) but I like the different tasks.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This sounded great so went for it. After at least a couple hours work and paying for $17.77 bait and switch anywhere access pack,  I finally have everything running on my phone, kindle and computer. And it's great but there's one Sunday afternoon ill never get back. I'd give the actual program 5 stars for once its finally up and running and one star for zero customer service response and also, as other reviewers warned, the bait and switch unfolding nature of this apps initial offer of a free app. I wouldn't have even minded paying the extra, just be straight from the get go. If this was somehow overly critical due to my own technical ineptness,then I sincerely apologize. For now though, this was my experience. Glad I have this remarkable integration, but the lengthy hassle of trying to get the whole working etc., was a royal drag. I would still recommend it though even though it definitely isn't free.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Saw it with my daughter at the drive inn & had to have it when it came out, haviing it on the Kindle is awesome cause we can watch it anywhere (most recently in the doctors office) which was so helpful!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|love to play it but now it dont open and i cant play this very very very very awesome game
B00AREIAI8|4.0|daughter loves it . keeps her busy for hours . maybe make more things available with less time and money spent .
B008FYZIVY|5.0|great show.  dvd is put together well.  this is nice to see coming from public television.  keep it up PBS.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I've learned how G5 marketing works and so I just know their games aren't actually free. I am enjoying this game and how the mechanics work much more than my Special Enquiry. The game is more polished and I like that I can choose the level of difficulty. I look forward to more games like this.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Got this game a few days ago  and haven't stopped playing it yet (except to write this review, of course). I definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it was horrible. i got a few songs and a couple days later... BAM!!! a virus hit. dont get this. it could ruin your kindle. luckily my lookout app warned me.thank god. my kindle is safe now.
0312323867|5.0|Love love love this!! After reading Something Borrowed and following madly in love with Emily Giffin's writing and style, I had to read this. I heard that this one was from Darcy's point of view and was turned off at first because of the way she was in SB but I gave this one a shot and loved it more than Something Borrowed. I literally could not put this book down, read it in one day... That is how good it was. After reading this, I saw Darcy in a totally different light and actually felt for her and kind of ended up liking her. If you liked Something Borrowed, stop reading my review and purchase this book now, you will be totally engrossed and into it until you finish it. Thanks Emily for getting me addicted to Chick-Lit and writing yet another fabulous novel!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Putting a tough New York cop in a clash with language, cultural, and religious barriers is a stretch. Although the currency of the Yemen setting and its endless complications of &#34;failed statehood&#34; provide a topical setting, taking Corey out of the USA and to the deserts of the Middle East is a push. The problems and the context are real but Corey wading though it all is too much.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|This is a very entertaining book. I gave it 4 stars because while it was good and enjoyable to read, it just didn't have the sophistication and action of Clancy's earlier writing.<br /><br />I suspect the book is mostly written by the co-author, a growing trend that I think should be discouraged.<br /><br />But the charactars are those developed in earlier stories by Clancy, and the action is pretty good though slow to develope.<br /><br />I would reccoment this book to others, but not as enthusiastically as earlier books by Clancy himself.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great read.  Exciting believable exhilarating ..  I want more.  There has not been one story I was disappointed in.  Read it.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|Put a band name in search & TuneIn will show you any stations that are playing that band in real time!!You can pause & rewind the music up to 30 minutes,has a 10 second rewind,you can record music & schedule recordings,works in standby saving battery.2 things though,1: You can't store recordings on external memory card with the Samsung Galaxy Player(goes to internal memory)Tried moving files to extrenal memory,didn't work.Pretty sure it's just the device your using!! 2: You can't rename recordings so if you have a few there is no way to remember what's on them unless you write it down.Just says station & time.Once you play a recording you can see what's on it.Minor inconveniences on a GREAT app!!Go to TuneIn's website & set up account so you won't lose your favorites if you change device!!Best 99 cents I ever spent!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded it and was awesome until 1 hour later it let me play anymore so I delete it and try to redownload it. Guess what don't work on my kindle fire.Same thing happened with the first game hope it gets fixed like the last game.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|My Kindle Fire fits great in this sleeve, good protection and you can also use it as a stand for your kindle. It is also a good price, price some of those at a retail store and they run about $15 more. Thank you
B00947N6UG|5.0|A great and ancient evil is rising in the land, and it is up to the guardians-Santa Claus, the Sandman, the Tooth Fairy, and the Easter Bunny-to convince the reluctant Jack Frost to fight for the innocence and imagination of the children of the world<br /><br />The quirky premise leads into an enchanting tale of faith and self-discovery. Jack Frost, whose heart is as warm as his magical powers are cold, is the reluctant Guardian-elect. Invisible to children, bereft of memories, and unclear as to his purpose, he wanders through life making mischief (the Easter Bunny is still deeply unhappy about the blizzard on the Easter of '64) and racking up more naughty than nice points. But when Pitch Black, the boogeyman, schemes to wipe out the faith of children in Santa Claus and the other Guardians, Jack Frost teams up with the Guardians to bring laughter and joy back to the children of the world. In the process, naturally, he finds himself and his innermost gift.<br /><br />The premise and plot, though simple, is beautifully written and wonderfully presented. The animation is dazzling and exciting (I'd be first in line for the ice-slicked roller coaster ride through the town, as seen in an early action scene) and the characters are charming and international in their appeal. Santa Claus speaks with a Russian accent and wields double blades. The Easter Bunny is over-sized at eight feet; he wields a boomerang and speaks Australian-ese. It would have been too much, I suppose, to hope that the Sandman would look like Morpheus from Neil Gaiman's Sandman series, but little Sandy kicked some serious booty with his Indiana Jones-style whips. The Tooth Fairy smiles too much; she raves and swoons over pearly white teeth. Jack Frost is at turns whimsically charming and heartbreakingly lonely.<br /><br />Rise of the Guardians will appeal to any young child who still believes, children/adults of any age who want to believe, and cynical adults (like me) who don't believe but who can appreciate a great story and awesome animation.eciate a great story and awesome animation.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|my horse rocks it is the best game ever.when I first played it I could not stop playing it.you should get my horse!!!love it
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Its not bad but you play with friends which makes but do like it so so I would download. It
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I thought this app would be great and I didn't really care about the bad reviews I just downloaded it and when I opened it I tried to type in a city and it froze my kindle fire hd for 24 hours .. beware
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I like anger bird bettter to hard to figure out how to make car go would not downlo at this at all unless you like tom
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't think I was going to LOVE it.  I thought it would depress me but I saw the great reviews and wanted something that I wouldn't stall on out of boredom.  As I read I realized that I wasn't going to be able to put this book down until I knew exactly what was going to happen to the characters.  And finally as I read the last page I felt a true sense of loss that I no longer shared space with these people.  I LOVE this book.  It'll stay with me as long I have the ability to access my memories.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like have a Bible on my kindle I like the daiy verse and if love the Bible you will love this
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have been a longtime fan of John Grisham. His books are easy to follow even without a legal background.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great passtime I love it wish there were more appps like this out there I don't even like horses but I love this game
B00933JL0A|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played. I think that the game is better than the one that cost money
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This is only the 2nd Stephen King novel I've read. The plot is excellent.  If you have a good amount of time to invest in reading, I highly recommend 11/22/63. It's a daunting 853 pages. One nice thing about having a new-born waking you up all night is the quiet time for reading. Without that it would have taken a lot longer to finish this one.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My name is Jasmine McDonald and i test games and rate and reviewed. This game is a good game.its fun and adventurous. Its full of action and i love it better than the first one. Keep making games like this and keep-m-fun.<br /><br />  -J McDonald
B008KRJWEK|2.0|This game is fun in the beginning.  It turns out the it is the same course over and over.  The power ups occur randomly so usually you don't get what you need.  After a while you would have to play for hours of spend real money to advance.  I understand they are in the business to make money, but why not create a game that is fun and doesn't cost a fortune to play?
B0032W5H9C|4.0|I love this movie.  Great acting, beautiful scenery and costumes, good music, screenplay by Nick Hornby... it was worth buying rather than just renting.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is surprisingly fun and interesting to play. I really enjoy all the different levels. Play it and enjoy!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I loved the format of writing. The story line was inspiring, motivating, and deals with every day situations. A must read!
B0054R6BFM|4.0|I am a media specialist and parent. You can bet I will look more deeply at concerns shared by my students and child.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This was a really fun game to play! :) I love the way you can make friends! I would defiantly recommend playing this awesome game!
B008EL4YX6|5.0|This game can provide hours of entertainment if you enjoy solving puzzles. The style is quite different than other puzzles I have played before.
B0086700CM|5.0|Keeps the kids busy...I don't see anything that I don't like just yet. It's fast paced and a lot of fun.
0765316994|4.0|This book is great. Its a thrilling book that kept me awake way late into the night. If you enjoy Heinlen and/or Scalzi, purchase. I wasn't even a sci-fi fan before reading Old Man's War.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This is my first Kindle, and first case so I really can't compare.  I love that is automatically turns on when I open the case.  I feel it protects, and I love the color.  The price was the best considering others were double the price.  Kindle is very secure, and I never feel like it is going to fall out.  Very happy!
0316228532|1.0|Rowling is a great author, but I'm afraid I didn't enjoy this book.<br /><br />She has the skill to keep the reader turning the pages, but when I got to the end, there just didn't seem much point to the book. Like the characters in the story, the book doesn't go anywhere. And, also like the characters in the story, the book has nothing to say.<br /><br />The Harry Potter series was superb.<br /><br />I think Rowling should bury the &#34;realism&#34; of Casual Vacancy and get back to fantasy.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Always a fan of Flynn's work. His knowledge of arms, Govt organizations, and how they work impresses me. But it's hero Mitch Rapp I love. Damaged but committed he's razor sharp, fearless and feared. Like that in a man, not a superhero, but one loyal to the U.S.  and he's not afraid to kill with justification and no seconds thoughts.  Still keeps his humanness and doesn't  whine about what must be done to keep the country safe. Go Mitch!  LNM
B008AK8FHM|3.0|the book is too techinal for me.  It is written for doctors using terms I do not recognize. However, it does have a good message..
0316666343|5.0|I was really impressed with the quality of book that I received in the mail.  It was in perfect condition!  I order this book at 11 pm on 1/16 and had it within a week!

B000N3ST7A|5.0|It's Stevie!  If you like Stevie, well of course your going to like this album.  Some old songs with the newer ones.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying the Wool series.  I recommend for anyone who likes futuristic, apocalyptic science fiction.  Hugh Howey really connects with his readers.

B009JBZH54|5.0|How could you go wrong?  $2 more for the trilogy than the single movie...good movies, good video and audio, good price!
0810993139|5.0|The book, likely written for kids at or above a fifth or sixth grade reading level, was better reading for a 37 year old than I could have possibly imagined. When I say that something is &#34;laugh-out-loud funny&#34; I don't want to be talking titters, mild chuckles, or undersized, underfed guffaws.<br />If you have anything at all to do with middle graders, get this book in their hands ASAP.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Enjoy posts by others especially recipes and home decorating ideas. But still new to Pinterest so I don't know everything it can do.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Well written and a very interesting read, I rated 5 stars for intelligence and the authors insight on sensitive material.<br />I would recommend that people who enjoy history and an odd twist to their reading material read this book a couple of times.
B000SW2F80|3.0|pretty good job of depicting steven king's work. However beginning to show it's age being somewhat dated. I love Steven King's work anyway though. Not as intense as Christine.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|it is a nice game, but all this back and forward gets boring.  it fun to play if really needs something to do.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I just love this movie!!!! Guys might not like it as much but if you like musicals, then you'd like this!!! If you like a cute romance, then you'd like this!!!! Parents, there is only like 2 scenes that could be questionable to kids under the age of 12. Great movie, though!!!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought this for sharpening various pocket knives and multitools. When I first got it I hadn't sharpened any of my knives in a very long time, so over a couple of weeks I sharpened about a dozen different blades. It sharpened the last one as well as the first. It is very functional for a variety of blades and sharpens quickly and well. The two different sharpening grooves are great for sharpening duller edges then finishing with the fine sharpening. The rod makes sharpening serrations easy and its cone shape works for any serration pattern. I was a little worried that its small size would make it difficult to use, especially for larger knives, but this was not a problem. Its sturdy and stays put with just two fingers and the downward force of the blade. The size also makes it great for keeping in any drawer around the house or workshop, in a toolbox, or in the car. Unless you are sharpening machetes or lots of knives on a daily basis, this all the sharpener anyone would need.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Played this game for two weeks. Woke up today and ALL of my hard earned coins and extras were gone. Starting me at square one. DELETED.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game for people who like horses. You have to take care of horses, train them for competitions and do lots of other stuff. If you have a kindle fire, and like horses, definitely get this app!
B008IGP8QE|5.0|daughter knew every song and loves austin moon. this product is very good and she sings his songs every morning
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never read and this series got me hooked i loved it.<br />great action, keeps you hooked the entire book.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Did I say OMG?? Yes I did!!  You will need to purchase this show at a very reasonable $1.99 per episode, just so you can go back and rewatch it to see if you really saw what you saw!! This in an amazing show with amazing talent...from the acting and writing to the cinematography and special effects.  My husband and I were watching back episodes last night, making comments about the acting and and wondering what kind of minds make this stuff up.  Truly horrifying and gripping from the first moment.  Jessica Lange is an incredible actress, and young Evan Peters has a great career in front of him.  Simply stunning...can't wait to see what Season 3 has in store  ;)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I'm joking this is a much better game haven't downloaded it on my fire but have it on my phone it is really cool
0061091480|5.0|There are great chapters in this book on guilt and worry that no other book seems to encapsulate like this one. Helped me!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is super awesome because of the details and graphics and I like the mega monkey, the zip line and the water falls. The thing i really like about it is how they make it look like he's up in the air. So I think that this product is a five star.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|As avid fans of anything Star Wars, and as big fans of Angry birds, this is a big hit. Very neat how they incorporate different characters and worlds.
B000N2HCM4|5.0|I love Barack's (Our Presidents) story. This book has given me an understanding of how this wonderful man began his journey as a positive activist and has become the most influential human being in my life.
B005R32L66|3.0|I downloaded Skype onto my Windows 8 Tablet to talk with my daughter in another state.  There have been some significant enough issues with the connection that most times we try to talk, we have to cut the conversation short.  From noise in the line to screen freezes, it's an OK product to use, but leaves something to be desired.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|All reviews are subjective, and this is no exception.  You will be told my impressions of this item as I am qualified.  There will be no discussion of cinematography, direction or acting.  The reviewer is unqualified.<br />What is the value of this series of shows?  They present the American presidency in the following aspects:<br />1) We see the everyday burdens of the president and his staff in dealing with Congress, the cabinet, varied constituents, donors, lobbyists and enemies.<br />2) We gain an appreciation of the media reporting from the White House and how for security reasons and political reasons some information must be withheld from the public.<br />3) We feel the terror when the president’s entourage is attacked by a group of gunmen who are fanatically opposed to the president’s daughter dating a black aide.<br />4) When this daughter is abducted by radicals the pressures to protect his own family from political foes is exemplified.<br />5) When the president must make public his multiple sclerosis to the voters before his nomination for a second term, we can appreciate the frustrations of a life dedicated to a cause which may be cut short by illness.<br />The acting is good as is the plot.  Some costars are added toward the end of the series, Alan Alda and Jimmy Smitts, and these perform wonderfully.  I admit a certain prejudice about this series.  The president is a liberal Democrat and this suits me very well.  However the Republicans in this show are treated fairly and with a great tolerance.<br /><br />The sets of disks covering seven seasons are very attractively presented in a container that will not detract from the most stylish furnishings.  When you consider what you get in this package I think you will agree it is worth the price.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I downloaded this game for my grandson to play on his Polaroid tablet.  He loves this game and plays it often while we're out and about.  It helps him pass the time and not be bored.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this app is amazing .but I never had the first one so it's overall awesome . It's great for kids ,teens ,parents,and toddler's . One thing  bad is that the ape things are creepy and there's only one ape this time not three. But it's all very very awsome:) .
145210655X|4.0|This is the cutest Star Wars book that I've ever read. I'm glad I added it to my collection.<br /><br />There are a few pages that almost had me rolling on the floor laughing.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, be they Star Wars fans or not.
B0027MJU00|2.0|I read this book after Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn.  I did not like this book. I  was very, very disappointed.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book was so good better then the movie it was great. I loved it i read it 4 tines.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I originally started watching this episode online on Amazon.com, but then decided to link up our PS3 to my Amazon account and watch it on our big screen. it was great. Season 3 promises to be as good as the previous two!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My wife and can't get enough of this show.  It will be sad to see the series come to an end....  So please keep the seasons going...
B005H29GSI|4.0|My son and I sat down to play Angry Birds: On Thin Ice and I found the game to be fun, but it involves some set up time between each round. You draw a card and recreate the layout of the level you find pictured, then use the birds listed to destroy the level. The 'ice' pieces fit together and are not hard to break apart, however the aiming of the slingshot takes some work, there is no real way of storing the game pieces once the game is over unless you save the plastic shell they come in and try to fit the pieces back in how they came. I would recommend this for a child that is old enough to assemble the levels themselves or parents with patience for a family game night because sometimes the levels fall down during construction and it can become tedious.
0470901071|4.0|Great so far.  Id like to give a full review AFTER I take the CCNA test.  Because of the book, I am understanding more and more of the terms and principals I'm using in my work.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|This book is more of a guide to the assesment test you take online. But it had helped me tremendously in my personal life and business.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My son was so excited Christmas morning when he opened it.  The perfect gift for him, it was the first thing that was opened after breakfast.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I was happily surprised to get this and realize southern rock still lives. I can't wait till they come up to NJ.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is awesome! In my opinion, I think it is better than the first Temple Run. I highly recommend this game for anyone! It is AWESOME!!!!!!
B006LS7DQE|2.0|The game would have gotten 5/5 except for the 10 second loading screens every minute... or the few crashes where I need to restart my Kindle to get the game to work again...
B0073XV2W2|5.0|As a techie I can say a lot of this is feasible. Some a bit unrealistic, but . . . Sure; go beyond that and allow yourself some imaginative entertainment! Hey, check out YouTube for \\"quadrotor\\" and see how much of this is plausible. Today; and cheap. For a few hundred bucks you can have your own drone \\"toy\\" albeit nonlethal! Some of the more pricey ones have autonomous inertial guidance; meaning they are super easy to fly. And some have teeny video cameras to spy on your neighbor! Amazon has a few different ones. For example: [[ASIN:B006R6EGCY BLADE mQX RTF]]. And a \\"real\\" hobby shop will have more sophisticated models.<br /><br />To see an amazing swarm demonstration of quadrotors (mineature drones), look in a YouTube search of \\"quadrotor swarm\\" for the clip of nano quadrotors at the GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania. Vehicles developed by KMel Robotics. If you're a technical whiz, please explain how the swarm communicates! (Hint: Look at the background.)<br /><br />The point is that the story is reasonably believable in the not too far future. I'm not much of fiction reader (tech stuff is my cheesecake), but this book had me. I read it in a couple of days, not quite nonstop, but almost couldn't put it (a new Kindle) down.<br /><br />BTW, the touch onscreen keyboard on those \\"pad-tablet\\" things suck. Even with a stylus. (Any pad from any manufacturer.) Stick with a PC for seriousness.
B006O2QNOU|3.0|This movie succeeds in getting the viewer to feel what it's like to be regarded as nothing more than a disposable drone at every level of the corporate ladder including the top. Reminds me of a pre-employment policy statement of a major bank I once read; Basically it said if your \\"lucky\\" enough to be hired, your tenure will literally be on a day-to-day basis no matter how talented you are, and you'll be expected to exceed all previouly set levels of productivity and profitability while maintaining the highest levels of ethics and morals. - LMAO!!!
B00APJLEGA|4.0|This movie is fun for the whole family. I have the kids aging from 13-8 and they loved it. We are so glad we bought the movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a great game so cool I love it and I'm sure that you'll love it greatest game ever
B003UYUP58|5.0|This is a biography of an unlikely subject: cancer. I had to overcome many generations of familial hypochondria to read this book and once I shoved those fears aside, I found the history of the diseases that make up cancer, its treatments and discoveries very interesting. The author's writing style makes medical and scientific information accessible to the layperson. His colorful descriptions of the doctors and scientists who have played roles in cancer's biography, from ancient Egypt to modern times, make the book engaging. He weaves his own experience as a cancer oncologist into the story and he treats cancer patients who play roles in the book with dignity. I often find Pulitzer prize winning books too high brow or intellectual for entertaining reading, but this is a book I would recommend to anyone who is interested in this subject.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed reading.  As always Grisham delivers entertaining and hard to put down story. Looking forward to reading his next book.
1451695195|4.0|I always find it fascinating when someone, in this case a neurosurgeon, comes to terms with the reality that God really does exist and that what the Bible tells us about the afterlife is real. PROOF OF HEAVEN is the account of Dr. Eben Alexander and his journey of discovery through his own near death experience (NDE) and the week he spent in a coma after contracting meningitis. Because Dr. Alexander is a \\"man of science\\" this book is supposed to solve the question once and for all, but it will hardly do so. In fact, there is already a book out disclaiming Dr. Alexander's account.<br /><br />The truth is, there will always be countless numbers who will discount any evidence whatsoever of a supreme being, and that number is growing daily. As our society pushes away from God and faith, it will become more and more difficult for people who have for years, rejected a notion, even campaigned to have it removed even further from society, to all of the sudden accept it. That would require admitting they were wrong and people, especially politicos, academes and scientific types, just don't like to do that.<br /><br />But there is another contingent of people, those who believe in the Word on God, but are conflicted because of the societal pressures that have been applied. No one wants to be considered foolish or nonsensical because of their beliefs, so in time, they begin to question their beliefs. They may even pray for \\"some sort of proof\\" of existence. They just want to be certain their faith is based on something real before they will go \\"all in\\" with it. For this group of people, this book is a \\"must read\\".<br /><br />I've not read much about NDE's, and I would not have read this book if my wife hadn't ordered it after hearing Dr. Alexander on one of those daytime drivel shows while she was recovering from an illness. Me being the consummate reader and her only usually reading 2 or 3 books per year, I'm always intrigued by the books she does decide to read, so as usual, I read the book before she get to it.<br /><br />The book is well written and will most certainly solidify those of questionable faith and will perhaps bring them some of the answers they seek.  For me, as a Pastor and person very comfortable with my faith and my relationship with God, this didn't really tell me much I didn't already know, other than perhaps some of the actual mechanics of journeying into the afterlife. I already know there will be no sorrow, no pain, and no regret. I already know about the indescribable sights, sounds and emotions. I've been anxiously awaiting these things most of my life, but I'm very in tune with the reality that most people are petrified of death and what lies in store. This book will help those people to relieve some of those unnecessary fears.<br /><br />Think of how glorious life on this earth really is. Physical death is when we leave this life and enter into the spiritual realm that is free from all of the pain and suffering of this life. That transition will be far more glorious than anything ever experienced in this life. Therefore, fearing death becomes an exercise in absurdity. Don't put yourself through that! This book will help you not only accept, but anxiously anticipate the day the Lord calls you home.I read the book before she get to it.<br /><br />The book is well written and will most certainly solidify those of questionable faith and will perhaps bring them some of the answers they seek.

B0085TKAW6|5.0|The story demonstrates how families, united in blood, can be so divided in the world of politics - the sins of the fathers......<br />During my daily routine, I find myself thinking of the war time situations that each country faced, particularly in Britain, Germany and Russia; I am thinking of the characters and the hardships they endured at that time although I finished the story a few days ago.  America was relatively unscathed, apart from Hawaii.  The story shows how communism and fascism can take hold when people are desperate for something to believe in or cling to and how apathy can be just as bad.  Many saw this as a life line to hold onto regardless of consequences (believing they had no choice) while others looked beyond the terrorizing and brutality of these &#34;thugs&#34; in power and suffered terrible losses in order to see their demise.<br /><br />It is a book well worth reading and I am looking forward to the third of this trilogy
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a nice and cool games to have and to keep u goin when u are bored and it shows u how to take care of a horse
0451232852|4.0|First book of Folletts that I have read. Not usually into historical fiction, but I made an exception in this case. Great read! Although its almost 1000 pages, it was a relative quick read. Follett kept the action moving. Also a good review of World War 1.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Yo recomendaría este libro a muchas personas que an llegado a los Estados Unidos. me gustaron muchas cosas de este libro.i también lo recomiendo a todos los que vinen como  visita  para aprender más de lo que ahí o que palabras usamos
B003ODI67E|5.0|I consider that Matt Ridley has provided the best possible antidote to the mindless doom and gloom predictors who rely on inadequate, incomplete and/or biassed statistical data to draw totally unreliable conclusions on future trends usually masquerading as &#34;scientific evidence&#34;. The Rational Optimist gives a much more balanced view and a useful reminder of the fallacy of assuming that the past is the map for the future.
B0058FOB2K|5.0|Excellent when recieved and too be a used item it was like it was brand new and I recieved it before the date I was suppose to recieve it! Love this service.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I needed to download this for the reason that I needed this software to view something. It worked so I'm glad I did

B008HK3S4K|5.0|These people got it right - it's everything I expected and more. This sleeve is a nice alternative to pocket type covers and fits right in my purse and provides excellent protection for my kindle. Love it love it love it!
B009KY0WCI|5.0|What a wonderful musician David Fray is. Sublime Schubert, then he gave us full-dimensional Mozart. Now his journey through Bach continues to astound. Little by little he keeps adding to his initial solo contributions, and then the concertos.  Now he adds partitas #2 and 6 to the #4 on a previous disc (coupled with a French Suite and Boulez's Notations, marvelous) so that now that we have all the even numbered ones, we will get the odd numbered ones soon.  Such intelligent and delightful Bach is hard to find.  Virtuoso though the playing may be, one never loses the perception that one is listening to Bach first, and only then to a pianist.<br /><br />The Toccata is no imitiation Argerich or Gould but establishes its own credentials and they are splendid.  If Martha's dances like the old Bolshoi, David's is definitely the Mariinsky or the Paris Opera Ballet. Different ways of attacking the same choreography, different ways of dancing. The analogy is apt, for this Toccata must dance.  If it doesn't, sorry, the playing fails.  No risk of that here.  What joys Bach gives us, what variety he provokes...... Thank you, JSB.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Cliché but I really couldn't put this book down. Highly recommend it. Really funny, action filled, hard science fiction novel.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I've been following the show since the beginning.  I love the crimes they solve and the personal stories of each character as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|ALL Downton Abbey videos are fabulous, and this UK version was no exception. Watch them all.  You won't be disappointed.
B0031RS4UM|1.0|Jack Reacher is a rogue cop, an ex-military cop to be precise, who is more concerned with what is right than what is legal. Yaaaaawwwn! He's big, he's dangerous, he's his own man and he dispenses his own brand of justice. He's a stereotype on steroids! So, with scant regard for the law or his own personal safety, he thrashes the bad guys and saves the day! Yawn, snooze, snore! It's all utterly predictable and reminiscent of every 'maverick' hero you've encountered between the pages of an airport thriller. However, these books are not without intrigue! There is at least the baffling question as to why they are so popular. Jack Reacher may outsmart the morons who get in his way, but I doubt he could explain why anyone would want to read about him.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I would like the next episode.  Look forward to ordering it.  {Please let me know when it's available.  Harriette Schofield
B00AYB20KI|4.0|Good thriller with unexpected ending Jennifer Lawrence is very good  actress I always love to see her in a any movie
B007KW5N9Y|4.0|Comparing to the DVD, there are not many content added.<br />The film quality seems better then the DVD, but the DVD was good as well.<br />The sound is kinda better I guess. It's an HD Sound but there's not much things to listen. It's not an action movie or a Sci Fi movie, so.<br />The booklet seems very luxurious.<br />Above all, half satisfied.
B006GX3ONK|4.0|Simple Minds produced some of the greatest tracks of the 80's and this box set comes highly recommended to listen to.
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Don't want to talk about the film.<br />We all know that the film is a masterpiece. Why again mention that?<br />The only thing I wanna talk about this item is, 'why don't they just sell the 3D version and lower the price'?<br />I won't pay 19 $ for re-buying DVD and Bluray 2D that I gave to my friend long time ago to re-buy the extended version Bluray set.<br />Done.<br /><br />PS: It's not 19.99$. If it goes down- I don't think so- to bellow 18$, Then I will consider buying it.
0316023744|5.0|Great for all World War Two buff, Antony Beevor's books are all great and all come highly recommended to all.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I didn't like comedies before but currently I bought a lot of them maybe because I wanted to change my lifestyle.<br />This one was so funny that I actually cried during laughing.<br />Two main actors' chamistry is so good and most of the actors are all very attractive.<br />The story is nothing, but the episodes and each scenes make the movie shine like a diamond.<br />So funny comedy.<br />If you need to laugh, buy this one.<br />It's a comedy so I wouldn't buy bluray though.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Classic adventure films from due of George and Steven, this box set has lots of extra futures which makes these films even more enjoyable.
0783229364|3.0|When I first watched this film, I actually enjoyed it.<br />But after 10 years (maybe more) When I purchased this in DVD, I kinda hated it.<br />There's no difference with this film and 'Working Girl'.<br />Actually Working girl is more fun to watch and the story is more convincing.<br />The film quality is good enough. It's a DVD not a Bluray or something.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2. I think it's a lot easier for people who aren't very good at temple run. It gets a little hard at the mine car but it's still awesome. I love the different scenes. At first the hills disoriented me but now that I'm used to it, it doesn't bother me.
B00005JMYI|3.0|The story itself seems very well written but the funny wise, it was so so for me.<br />Two main actors were very good but I wasn't laugh over tears.<br />Usually Will was so funny in his other movies that I expected too much.<br />Above all fun to watch killing time film.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Beyond Good! This series is great and addicting. Great acting and suspenseful. Every episode has you on the edge of your seat!
B005LAIHZY|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. The 3D Animation is probably one of the best that Pixar has released. The voice actors were good as well.<br /><br />The only problem is that Pixar has risen the bar so high for themselves that this movie does not compare to some of the greats story-wise. It lacked a little in the general overall story and character development that existed in most of the other movies.<br /><br />That being said, it was still a great movie, worthy of being added to any family's collection.
0316069884|5.0|Foer's book is well-written, interesting, and insightful.  I loved the way he weaved the theme of thinking about our food, or \\"we are what we eat,\\" into the narrative.  I hope more non-fiction books are in Foer's future.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I actually fell into the \\"Gray\\" series without knowing the subject or the controversy. I had a new Kindle, my daughter in law set it up and asked what book did I want and so the journey began.<br /><br />I am in my late 60's and while not a prude or naive, I was a little shocked and at  times turned off by the sexual content,both in amount and explicitness and decided to read only the one book as I had paid for it.  The story was so much more important that the sex, that when I got to the end of #1, I had to find out what was going to happen to this couple as there were lots of changes going on with the two principal characters, several minor characters, a twisting and provocativethen the plot and sub plot. I had to read II and then dive into III.Once again, I had been left hanging and speculating and had to go on to book III.<br /><br />I am so glad I purchased I unknowingly as all three books were wonderful reads.  Many of my friends teased me about my dirty books but after a little explanation of the story, they too read the \\"dirty books\\" and no one quit without reading all three.<br /><br />We are products of our experiences and environment and these books explore this as well as how each of us can overcome adversity by developing a shell, behviors, psyche to protect ourselves and we can also recreate ourselves given the appropriate motivation.<br /><br />I hope there will be a !V.

B00B2V66VS|1.0|Temple Run 2 is an awesome game with awesome graphics, BUT everytime I load it it crashes!!!! But the thing is, it only crashed after I stopped playing it for a while. I deleted it, then reloaded it, which worked for a while, but then it stopped working AGAIN and now it wont let me reload again! Imangi Studios, fix the glitches in the game. please.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It is kind of hard to click off the tiles at times.  I would like the game better if you could change the tiles to make them more recognizeable.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Much better than the first book of the trilogy. I can't wait to start reading the third one. Lots of emotions, great characters, just great!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like this app but i have to keep stopping from playing it because i have to wait to be able to do things on it again. i like this app though because i really like horses and it allows you to understand the work that has to be put into to actually own a real horse.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I never ever in my life thought a book would bring me into tears like this one did. I am a freshman at n high school and this book is amazing.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in over a decade!!!!!<br /><br />This trilogy has taken me by surprise. I didn't think it would be this amazing
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I think My Horse is a very creative game. To me, it gets bored. They could do work on in, improve it, and make an updated version.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|At first I got this app just thinking I was going to put pictures on it to make them look cool then transfer them to my phone. but even though the kindle fire doesn't have a camera, this is the best app I have on here. I have never had to force close it and I haven't had any issues. best picture app out there. by far. I totally recommend for anyone with a smartphone or kindle fire. its AMAZING!!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is just okay. I do use it everyday, but it will not let you send a private message if they are not logged it. It also will not show game gifts or requests that are sent :(
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The first time I played it I love it was better quality than the other temple run I love it
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love it on my kindle. It will alert you when you get a notice and only shows the chatting page you are on. Some people like it some like the computer version with information on the side.
B00A6HHJ9C|5.0|The new album by guitarist extrodinaire and Toto's longest standing member Steve Lukather, is another masterpiece. It has everything we've come to expect from Steve; well written, melodic songs, and great guitar playing from start to finish. From the opening track \\"Judgement Day to the last, the great instrumental of the old classic \\"Smile\\" this album is another triumph for \\"Luke\\".
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My son loves everything angry birds. He loves the star wars and the seasons along with the holiday. Great for young kids.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its about time they made available on kindle. I BEEN using this game on my iPhone. REAL cool and more 3dish<br /><br />Love the game
B00632HWOG|5.0|My kindle alerts me when I get an email it does not show my spam mail but it does filter it better through the kindle
B000068TPN|5.0|This is the most realistic and believable movie we have ever seen about the Vietnam War.  Bravo! Indeed very affecting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is great cause my 6 year old and my 12 year old both love this game. I have also caught myself playing it a couple of times.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I thought the game was fun. wish there was more to it then just running thought. maybe actually make the chharwcters get the idol then run off with it.
B00337KM2S|5.0|Jason Reitman delivers what I consider to be George Clooney's Best Film and a must see for anybody who is doubtful about their job status becuae it really hits home.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Just finished the movie and we loved it. Great music, good humor - if you're forever a teenager- and we are. I love Rebel's lines and all the girls sounded great. I'm also a big 'Workacholics'fan! Seeing Adam Devine be, well, himself ... pretty much (as he is on the show)was a good time.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|The most brilliant Movie I've ever seen with great acting and great comedic spins on the making of Romeo and juliet.<br /><br />A must have for Hopeless Romantics and defiinitely made for a broad audience.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|exciting. challenging.  very realistic.  really enjoyed playing this game. easy to understand instructions. face paced need good coordination. loved it
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|But the tickets were $135 for bad seats and I didn't have the money.<br /><br />Brilliant documentary about the short lived reunion tour with all Five Eagles and featuring their best music both solo and as a band.<br /><br />My Two Personal Favorites:<br /><br />&#34;Help Me Through The Night&#34; sung by Joe Walsh<br />&#34;Hotel California&#34;
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like this game. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes it won't let me play it... It will load for a little and then send me right back to my home screen...
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Exploring the world of professional modeling through the eyes of an idiotic,self absorbed,bumbling,male model &#34;Derek Zoolander&#34; and brilliant perfomances by Jerry Stiller,Owen Wilson,Will Ferrell,and even Jon Voight.<br /><br />I also loved the cameo by David Bowie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Excellent game and my 4 year old Grandson loves it and is very good at it. I don't even try it as it is too fast for me.
B0000A98ZP|4.0|Because you think of John Hughes as being a bubbly status quo filmmaker you're not used to watching five teens from different backgrounds and a true drama that un-folds in the course of a 7 hour period among them and their different views.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Glad I started reading this series.  I will look forward to the finish of the entire series when the third book comes out.
B000HF0ILY|5.0|Even &#34;The Unforgiven&#34; couldn't hold up to this timeless epic of an un-named stranger who went by The Preacher saving Tin Panners in the West from the Tyranny of a Coal Baron. Great Flick and one of my personal favorites
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Good finish for the series of books.  Glad I read them.  It was really good.  Ending was a little fluky though.
076780421X|5.0|A Wonderful Movie featuring brilliant acting and an honest story of love with cute innocent comedy mixed in.<br /><br />A Must Have.
1419701533|5.0|Just what the child I bought this for wanted.  Was very happy with this.  Glad I got it for her
B00000IQC8|5.0|His first movie done on a shoestring budget and offering actors that were complete uknowns to the world.<br /><br />Comedic genious and great writing made this film.<br /><br />It's a shame that he couldn't deliver the same magic with Clerks 2.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Look forward to reading this.  Follett writes great books and I look forward to his thrid bood fo the series.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|I couldn't find this anywhere and found it at Amazon.  It was as described and arrived on time.  This is one of my all time favorite movies.  WARRIORS COME OUT TO PLLAAAYAYYYY....favirite part in whole movie!!!!
B000050XEI|5.0|What a great album.  Very relaxing.  I am really glad I bought it.  I like this artist and will buy more of their works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it.  Fave game of mine.  Hope everyone else will play it. If you love horses you will love this game.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This is a good series.  I really had a hard time putting the book down once I started it.  Great book.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Not one of those pointless apps people like to show their friends. Very easy to use. Get it, you'll like it, its pretty nifty.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Bought it for my mom and she was thrilled.  She can't stop talking about how great the series is.  She loves it!
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I first recognized Ferguson from the movie \\"Saving Grace,\\" and only recently discovered that he hosts \\"The Late Late Show.\\" From there I learned of this book. Reading his book has given me a new appreciation for his comedic commentary on the show. Ferguson writes in the same manner as he speaks, recounting the key moments that have shaped his life today and are presented in yummy, bite-sized anectodes. Ferguson's writing hits the reader as reality hit Ferguson in the moments he is describing. His attitude through the narration is sincere and at times bittersweet,  but with a tenacity that makes it easy to keep reading. If you were charmed by Ferguson's candid personality and rounded humor in person, you'll get a laugh from this, too. I know I did.... In fact--I hate cliches but--I laughed, I cried (just a little), I'll read his book again. And I would definitely recommend this to a friend... or a stranger. :-)
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I bought this for my daughter's boyfriend and they both raved about this series.  They love it and hope to order the 2nd season soon.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|OMG!!! I have never been compelled to write a review about any movie, but this one....WOW!!!! I can see now why it was nominated for every award under the sun. Brilliant cast, Superb dialogue, Masterfully directed & acted. WOW!!! Layers upon layers of deep meaning, it really touches your soul!! The story line \\"seems\\" simple enough: Guy sees wife having sex with another man, goes kind of crazy violently attacking him. Gets put in a mental institution for 8 months, tries to stay positive, moves back in with his ocd parents who are obsessed with football. He is obsessed with getting back with ex-wife, meets a young girl who has her own issues since her husband died, she grieves by having a lot of sex. She agrees to help him get his ex back in exchange for him joining a dance competition. He realizes after a long while that they love each other. But it is so much more than that!!! While I appreciate the prior reviews, they made me run to go see this movie, but I almost wish I hadn't read them because it took a little bit of the element of surprise out. Still, OMG!!! Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence & Robert DeNiro NEED to get awards for their roles! Their characterizations were SPOT. ON. BRILLIANT!!!! That's all I'm going to say, you just HAVE to go see it!!!!! You HAVE to!!!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Never thought I would like a series about zombies, but this show is amazing!!  The story line and character development is top notch.  Definitely worth checking out!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|We really like this and suggest others to give it a try.  We do not think you will be disappointed.
B000OCXI3K|5.0|The most gripping quality of Chocolat is the writing. Joanne Harris makes the world of Vianne Rocher vivid, intimate, and yet mysterious. The beauty, horror, and solace of life in a sleepy French village comes alive through Vianne and the reader can almost feel the chocolate melting on the tongue. It is a gem of contemporary fiction that will please any reader looking for a sense of magic in the ordinary and extraordinary turns life takes.
B00007GZR0|5.0|I love Doris Day and Rock Hudson. Very funny movie! It was well worth the price and arrived very quickly.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game is a good time waster, but it lags in places on the original Kindle Fire.  And I've had the game crash a few times.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|The story line is pretty current to 2012. Mostly aimed at 18-20 year olds Pith Perfect also includes several scenes that will resonate with anyone that was a freshman in college. It addresses issues of young adult anxieties about being themselves vs fitting in with the different &#34;crowds&#34;.<br />The musical score is great with music that encompasses several generations up to about one year ago. The main characters are quite believable for the most part and the actors do a good job projecting how a freshman in college deals with parents, new found friends and kids that  are either not friendly or indifferent.<br />The roles of the commentators were funny at times but too unrealistic. Many of their comments  would never be allowed on the radio or television.<br />Overall we enjoyed the movie. This is a perfect rental movie, we would never pay $8-10 at our local movie-plex.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My 4 year old caught on very quickly.  Through trial and error he figured out the game's objective.  He loves it!  And I think it's a fun strategy game.
0525478817|1.0|I bought this book because of it's incredible feedback and was so excited to read it.  Then I finished and thought...okay, and what was so great?  All the book consists of is cheesy pick up lines and overly sarcastic dialogue.  The characters are annoying, the story feels forced.  Never once did I shed a tear.  The thing is, I've never read a John Green book but I knew a lot about him and his career and this book just seems to not be playing toward his strengths.  It just isn't believable and seems very Hollywood which is something I didn't expect from Green.  For such a good writer, I expected something more moving and powerful. It is a book about cancer and yet I never felt sorry for either character.  It is a cheesy teenage love story and all their love consists of is them saying okay to each other...and that's it. Each one had a glass half-empty look on life and I just didn't care.  I will never know why people enjoy the book so much...
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|I rarey write reviews but I could not continue reading past the first half!  Sorry I bought the book.  I think it was written for teens.  Generation gap perhaps?
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|The collaboration between Clancy and Greany teamed up last year with Dead or alive and locked on. This book was great!<br />In true Clancy fashion real life situation comes at you, and warfare now elevates to cyberwar between China and the U.S.A. One general imperialist ambitions coupled with a crisis like red storm rising. couple that with the MSS knowing about the campus.<br />The cyberware directorate is hitting the US infrastructre hard.<br /><br />But then we come back figting and as always their's no victories without sacrifices of people and relationships.Including the retirement of Mr. Clark. I hope we see him in a future book. Maybe he work at the campus as head of security. He has been my favorite badass since without remorse. The writing was belivable and fast paced. It kept glused to the edge of my proverbail seat. I recomend thsi book to any Tom Clancy fan!!!!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very addictive game.  This one seems to let you score big more often.  Play it everyday and enjoy it. I would recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Had to watch episode after episode.  Great value for the price. Looking forward to watching the rest of the season.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Chuck Norris was classic, laughed my butt off.  Van Dame made a great bad guy.  All the big action dudes did awesome
0345803485|1.0|These terrible books began as fan fiction based on the equally terrible Twilight books and the author (this is a relative term) E.L. James is a total hack.  All of the books in this series are absolute tripe yet they have been ravenously snapped up be the worldwide reading audience.  Seems we are just that much closer to \\"Idiocracy.\\"<br /><br />EDIT: I recently read that this series has sold over 70 million copies worldwide and set the record as the fastest-selling paperbacks of all time, surpassing the Harry Potter series.  And now of course there's the movie franchise which will undoubtedly make E.L. James rich beyond imagination.  When/why did we decide to celebrate the inept, talentless and unoriginal?  This just makes me sad.
034580404X|5.0|This came quicky and was packaged neatly and nicely. I got it on sale and the value is well worth it in every way.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|It's addictive and it's hard.  I think I'd better keep this around for my grandson.He loves Angry Birds.The younger minds are better at this.
B0011Z51QG|5.0|got this with a credit I had...brings back memories of my high school days when I loved this album...still loving the music.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I  HOPE TO SEE THE MOVIE OF THIS FASCINATING BOOK.  MARTEL IS ANOTHER GOOD WRITER.  KEEP GOING MARTEL, AND I WILL ENJOY MORE OF YOUR WORK.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. My extroverted husband read it first and declared it help him understand me better than any other book in the 20 years we've been together. It helped me understand him in a new way as well. I've already admonished a speaker who said when doing fund raising send in those outgoing people who LOVE people. The myth is alive and well that introverts don't love people. Thanks for unraveling some ancient misconceptions about myself and helping me view my current life in a healthier way.
B0086700CM|5.0|everyone loves it right? and so do I ^^ wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow wow
B00AREIAI8|4.0|it is a nice game if you have extra time on your hands. it is good for just about anyone who is able to read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like to play solitaire and use it when on a car trip.  It helps to pass time while driving.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It is bad don't  buy it because,<br />it froze  on me.<br />so that is why i don 't like it.
6302797586|5.0|I bought this a long time ago.  It is a good movie starring good actors.  This is one of Anthony Hopkins early  films and is quite worth watching.
1400052173|5.0|This is a book that I will never forget!  I now see, how she can live on forever in this earth!  I learned a lot about the medical<br />and scientific world!  Pay attention to what you sign, or know nothing about!  Read this book, it will open your eyes!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game and reminds me of the old card game about pipes.  It is very challenging and each puzzle is very different.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the 1st season on Netflix, then wanted to watch the 2nd season ASAP before the 3rd season was going to be shown on TV, so I bought the Amazon on line version and am a fan for as long as the season runs!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|This is fun because it can be played by one person.  It is a good time filler while on a road trip or sitting in a doctor office.<br />I recommend this game.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Was looking To catch Up On some Shows That I Missed during the first run This Is Great Don&#34;t Miss Out
B0096BIENY|5.0|I can't begin to describe how amazing every selection sounds.  This individual and collective voices and song selection makes this CD my absolute favorite. Truly amazing!
B0013F1D02|5.0|Hi,<br /><br />It's a great Movie and I like to watch alot it will be great to have it soon.<br /><br />  Candy
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 10 year old son love this game. He said he really enjoys playing it. Download was easy for tablet
B00A1C1DYE|5.0|This box set came on time, in perfect condition. I am a huge fan of the show so being able to catch up on every season is awesome.
B005HSL626|5.0|My 10 year old son and daughter love this game. He said he really enjoys playing it. Download was easy for tablet
B008Q7O6VS|5.0|I remember buying CTE on casette back in July 92, and I was hooked on the first listen. Then later, I bought the 2004 remix and remastered version on CD and I didn't really like that version as I had thought I would.  Now, CTE has been put back into its original state, but remastered for better sound quality,...and it doesn't get any better than this!  This will remind all fans who remember the first release how awesome this album was and still is! All instruments, vocals, and effects are clearly heard and it all sounds crystal clear. Buy this version only!  Don't waste your time and money ont the 2004 remixed,remastered version.  Buy this version instead and hear \\"Countdown\\" the way it should be heard! Oh, by the way,..the bonus CD of the live performance at The Cow Palace is awesome as well.  I went to this tour back in Dec. 92 in Houston, Tx. and the setlist was the same as on the CD.  Awesome show!
B008F9E306|5.0|From beginning to end, this album is a great one. T.I. is back in full force. Buy the physical album or the digital and you won't be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|seem ok for now. i did not use it that much, but from what i can see so far its okay.
B002JODUI4|5.0|I've purchased this album for myself and over the past year my little sister has grown to liking Deadmau5 and found this album from the collection I have to be her favorite.  'Hi Friend' is a top pick for the both of us!
B004UID2LC|3.0|This is eacy to use. and dowbload pretty fast. seem ok for now. i did not use it that much, but from what i can see so far its okay.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is described as stated above and enjoyable to play. I would recommend to anyone who is a solitare enthusiast.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|He did it again. A few tricks, but also long in parts without action. Still a good read with a few good angles.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was the best one I have read in a long time. Being a high school student, it really gives you good look inside what some of the &#34;weird&#34; or &#34;different&#34; kids go through. This book is definitely worth your time.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I apologize that this message is late. I received this movie a while ago. Thank you for shipping this so quickly and in great condition. I plan on having a Harry Potter mega marathon after I get the last two!<br /><br />Thank you for your help :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's so realistic. Like the graphics, but the shape of the great minds of bothers.any one else? Overall, great game.
B00AE2J5HI|3.0|I liked the movie, and it displays a bit of history into America's past in dealing with moonshine.  Some of the scenes might be a bit graphic for any sensitive viewers.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It doesn't matter whether you were the jock in high school, the nerd, the loner, or that person everyone seemed to hate for no apparent reason. You will relate to this book in someway. It makes you a wallflower for a short period of time and Mr. Chbosky does a astonishing job at making you a \\"filter rather than a sponge.\\" I can only hope that if you are older this reminds you just how hard it can be to transition or find yourself.
B003E88TKS|3.0|This film was good overall.  I like most of George Clooney's movies, and this was about a 3 out of 5 rating.  Kind of a surprise ending, but does reflect true life scenarios.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is probably the best game ever according to me..I think the worst thing is the minecart ride.... that really bugs me.. but other than that, think this could be the best app for kindle fire in 2013
B00846TRHY|4.0|I liked it overall.  It's based on a true story, and I felt it was worth the $3.99 cost to rent online.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book. Very fun and suspenseful. I liked this book a lot even though I do not know much about the 80's. I would recommend this book to everyone with how good it is. I give a lot of credit to the author of this book for making it so exciting and excellent.
B008Y6ZTKS|5.0|This movie will take you from cheers to tears and back again. A truly amazing story about overcoming the worst and demonstrating perseverance!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is really good I think it really deserves 5 stars you should get it it is better than the pc version because in survival you don't<br />have a hunger bar so that you don't starve to death
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is an amazing Peter Pan movie, having read the book I have to say that it's the most acurate out of all the Peter Pan Movies Ive seen , and Ive seen all of them. I would highly recomend buying this movie to lovers of this J.M. Barrie classic.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Excellent program to obain current or future weater conditions.  Stores multiple cities, has ability to check weekly future forecasts for any city.  Great for travel.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I gave it a four because I don't like the power ups. like temple run but the grafhics are great if u have a kindle or something with high definition
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I am very happy with this program and have no qualms in recommending it to others. Any glitches or problems have been fixed  and the sounds run smoothly and blend perfectly. With the paid version, you get a LOT of sounds....many more than in the free version. I travel and this is my \\"go-to\\" for winding down and getting to sleep.  The sounds can be mixed and matched depending on your needs and  preferences. This has become one of my favorite apps. It is soothing, relaxing and a perfect oasis of calm .....at a really cheap price.
1591843790|4.0|As leaders we need to reflect and remotivate from time to time. This books did just that for me. I have since shared it with my brother who recently was laid off. I hope he sees his amazing strengths and move forward!
B005LAII80|1.0|I bought this on 3D Blue Ray & it was a total waste!  Would like to return for a REFUND!!!  What a joke!  The only real scene that felt 3D was the glass particles for a few seconds right at the END!  Stupid, flaky, low budget film, they never leave the one location!  Wait for free TV version if u must see, but don't waste your $ to see this on 3D Blu Ray!!!!!!<br /><br />Seller was fast shipping, only good about this purchase, just wish I could return it for refund or exchange!
B005JJCMN0|3.0|Outstanding visually but not as moving as the master's earlier works but still it's Kurosawa so it's worth a look!
B006JSXYPA|3.0|This movie has some good 3D effects.  Doesn't make you jump out of your seat feeling at all, but has some cool dimensions.  Watched it 1st on Blu-Ray, then 3D with Blu-Ray.  Have to say 3D was better, just wish there had been more scenes where the 3D was captivating!  Ok is my rating.  Surround sound added some sensation at times, just not consistent.  A good part of the movie can be viewed in 2D & never know there is any 3D...
0439813786|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it so wanted to read the book.  The movie was pretty true to the delightful story.  It is a story that both children and adults will enjoy.  The artist draws you into the story with his magical illustrations.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book was well written and captivating.  Held my attention throughout the entire book.  The only reason I gave it  4 stars is because the ending was a bit disappointing and far fetched.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves 2 as much as she loves 1.  She really enjoy it.  It loaded very fast.  Great game!
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I liked it and there was action but I just felt it was missing something. I don't know if the story line had less detail; normally they show what lead you to become a cop but they left that a mystery.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|SO much more fun than the original. New powerups, love the location changes. The obstacles are harder in this one, but I still find it more fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a great sequel to hunger games I cannot put it down! I am so excited to finish this book and pick up the next!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The game is much better than temple 1 but when I'm playing it freezes and xs out of the game. And I'm doing really good 2. Idk y it does tht.
B006HL9G10|5.0|There are several bell sounds to choose from and many possible times, from minutes to hours.  I really enjoy looking at where other people are meditating around the world.  Really nice.
B006OOHYIC|3.0|When I am in the mood for restful thinking, this is the game for me. It is challenging but not too much. There are solutions available although I've never accessed them. You can earn hints, and they really help.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it has very good graphics. love this game. takes a while to load but its worth it.  Ive seen a lot of games but this is one of the best
B009MCRHH6|2.0|I downloaded this because it was free and looked different than what I've already got on my Kindle. It is physics based and simple enough. However, getting it solved is quite difficult. My 23 yr old son likes it, but I took it off to put other stuff on my Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I got this app yesterday and I am totally recommending this game to anyone who has played a game like this before
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a game that I keep coming back to play. It is clean and straight forward. If you do well with spacial games, this is for you. All my adult kids like it and we all have it installed on all our devices. Easy to access and play - challenge to complete as you get up in the levels.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is an awesome series. It starts slow and will go through periods of boring setup again before getting back to the good stuff but it really was impossible for me to put down. It reminds me a lot of the Lord of the Rings in that the web George RR Martin weaves in an incredibly vast scope. My advice is not to get hung up on the details.. if you lost track of who's who... just keep going. The author will catch you up down the road.
B00000K3D4|1.0|It was scratched, and started skipping when i tried to watch it, so you could say that i am definitely very dissappointed :/
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love this cute game. unicorns are a nice touch! I cant belive the graphics. they make it look so real.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played it's allowed me to play online with friends from all over the world.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Mockingjay was very detailed and really struck your emotions, I am telling you the truth that once you start reading you won't stop
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I LOVED this book!! I couldn't put it down!  Rick Riordan has done an amazing job and those who are Percy Jackson fans definitely won't be disappointed! I loved this book and can't wait to read the next one! GO Heroes of Olympus!!!!!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|As to be expected, the characters are true to their basic traits, Draper's autocratic style and his uncontrollable addictions, Peggy's thoughtful but ambivalent personality, Megan's fresh and courageous style, Betty's melancholy boredom with life, Joan's cool yet penetrating gaze, Campbell's feckless ambition and self promotion. Roger Sterling's complete (but witty) cad, king of the comeback.  The only character that I find a bit confusing is Ginsberg who is partly a caricature of the brash but insecure, klutzy Jew and partly a creative genius (how can someone be so sensitive and insensitive at the same time?).  All the characters alternate between existential and humdrum daily issues and all are slaves, in some way, to their inner demons.  Some day, this will get old, but the thoughtfulness with which each episode is constructed is still there as is  the fanatic attention to detail and period authenticity.  Question: can't anyone begin to deal with their alcohol or  smoking addiction?
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is fun although I enjoy the original temple run much much better just because it's easy but I like the zipline
B0031MA7RA|5.0|Amazing book.  I have learned so much about physical limitations and endurance and possibilities of recovery after a stroke.  I would recommend this book to anyone, stroke victim or not.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|This book took me about a week to read!! It's all about love, and how it's &#34;dangerous&#34;. My friend suggested this book for me to get, and I'm so happy I listened to her. It's amazing on how you will connect with the characters, and feel for them too!! I believe anyone, and everyone should get this book!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is totally awesome has all the features of owning your own real horse all but the mess and stench if you love animals this is right for you five-star rating so have fun
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the best!!!!!! The game is definitely more challenging then the first one but it is still really fun!
0199206589|5.0|This book was great. It was very informative and it gave a great introduction into what geopolitics are and how certain countries and institutions use the concept.
0345803485|3.0|The bottom line is when the book FINALLY got to Anna's first sex. I failed to become aroused. My member was not amused. Also she never uses the word cock or pussy their sex parts are never directly named. The entire first half is just teenage girl twittering should I do he maybe if etc. This is the Archie comic version of a BDSM novel. Bad as it is it still is readable and I suppose I will finish it eventually. But I would recommend Anne Rices Beauty trilogy, thats some good nasty fantasy sex.
B0002B15XI|4.0|Always like to watch M.A.S.H., it's a good movie and t.v. show. Needed to update from VHS to DVD. Thanks!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Wonderfully written from the perspectives of a black female slave and a white female indentured servant. You can't help but feel very strong emotions for all of the characters in the book, both good and bad. Incredible first novel from Ms. Grissom - looking forward to the next.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This was for my husband he is a big fan and now he has plenty to watch when there is nothing elsr on tv. The service was great.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This is an excellent puzzle game.  Hope they come out with a second one.  Great graphics and lots of fun.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I tried to read this slowly and savor it , but as always I couldn't stop reading. Now I have to wait awhile before my next date with Harry!
0307352145|5.0|A valuable volume for the understanding of yourself and others.<br /><br />The world seems to be catered to the extrovert. Whether in the job search market, the workplace or the classroom to name a few, experience and studies in everyday life seem to follow this rule. This book is a treasure trove of information in the presentation which follows the history and science of the study of introverts and extroverts and the underlining differences between the two personality types. Shows the extrovert ways of bringing out the valuable contributions of introverts whether a loved one, a teacher, a coworker, friend or neighbor. Also gives suggestions for introverts on how to gain confidence and adapt to the extrovert world. Highlights many stories that enhance the material being presented.<br /><br />Extremely interesting and thought provoking research has went into the creation and execution of this book. As a mostly extrovert personality who lives with and interacts with introverted personalities I found that once I started reading I couldn't stop reading. The material was presented in a knowledgeable and compassionate style as I recognized others within the pages and gained valuable skills I can apply to my own relationships. Very well written no dull or broken parts. I was highly entertained and will recommend this book to others. I received this book for free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing Group for my review. Very easily 5 stars!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book has the best kind of ending...makes you hungry for more! Can't wait to get into the next one!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another great story by Kate Morton. So enjoy her way of thing the past and present together and the mystery there within.
B005R32L66|5.0|Skype comes in and sends my image as good as my computer. Only used it a couple times so far.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly continues to spin detailed, mostly believable,  humorous and suspenseful Bosch stories with a very human side for his cases, co-workers and family. Always a good entertaining read.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I love CCR and this album has all my favorite songs on it. Sound quality is good too. Mixes in with my other songs great.
B0063IH60K|1.0|The game was OK I guess but every time I opened it for play I was thrown into a singles dating site.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I bought this to take up some time when I was waiting for appointments. It works good, but I wish it had some other kinds of solitare games on it.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Great actors, directors and story!  I can't think of three better actors than Bridges, Goodman and Buscemi (or supporting actors) who could have pulled this together so well.  I've watched it several times over the years and I never get tired of it!
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|fun stuff and it starts up easily.  It's good for kids and adults (that think they're kids). I would recommend.
B001RMYWG8|4.0|They don't make movies like this anymore.  Al Pacino shows why he is one of the greatest of all time!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Growing up in New England I could totally relate to this type of humor.  I cannot remember the last time I laughed so friggin haaad!
B004J4WKTW|2.0|Definitely didn't like the abuse of body and mind. This was a selection for my book group and had been read previously by the person putting it up as a choice. We stretch ourselves by reading all types of material with the desired results of learning something new. Too dark and other worldly for me ...
B0011Z3334|5.0|It really showcases Hayley's voice. From her Punk/Alternative voice in songs like &#34;Fences&#34; (my favorite ^^) to her raw singing ability in the slower songs like &#34;When it Rains&#34; and &#34;We Are Broken&#34;, this album is incredible all the way around. I would recommend it to any Alternative fan.
B0031RS69G|5.0|I was surprised to find out The Colour of Magic was 30 years old, as the humor didn't feel dated at all. It's a delightful and charming and oh so very British spoof of all kinds of fantasy, from Robert E. Howard's barbarian prose to Lovecraft's never-to-be-mentioned horrors from beyond space and time. The book follows crappy wizard Rincewind as he guides first-tourist-ever Twoflower through first the city of Ankh-Morporkh, and later the wider Discworld. They stumble into barely-connected adventures, meet colorful characters and incur the wrath of the (though not all) gods by tempting Fate repeatedly and (though not always) wilfully.<br /><br />The cliffhanger ending might annoy some, but I thought it was a thematically appropriate \\"eh, whaddya gonna do?\\" way to end this first Discworld novel. I'll certainly be getting the next one!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed these movies since they came out, but in the blue ray format, they are even better.  Graphically and sound is far better than the originals.  Glad that I bought these.
B00AO2P3GA|1.0|Whenever I try to download it it tells me that it has failed to download. Also it says that yes, I did indeed buy it. WTF why cant I play it then. I'm getting angrier and angrier by the second
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Beth Hart may be the best blues singer alive.  If you saw her perform &#34;I'd Rather Go Blind&#34; during the Kennedy Center Honors, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD for that song alone.  Coupled with some very tasteful guitar work by Joe Bonamassa and a great selections of songs by other great artists, this CD really stands out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing I love it so much: it is very addictive and fun to play. I highly recommend. it.
0684824906|5.0|Read the book before you see the movie. It gives a great insight into the times and the political thought. You think times are strange now, Lincoln was a man among men.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I loved this story! It was a beautiful romance but at times I felt like parts were pointless making the story longer. I give this book 4 stars it is definitely a good read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must app for anyone who wants to do Bible study. The Bible that have voice over are the best.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like having the Bible on my Kindle.  It enables me to keep up with my daily reading even when I oversleep and have to rush off in the morning. :)
B00B2V66VS|2.0|This game is a blast, however, I have a lot of green emeralds saved up because each time I tell it to &quot;save me&quot;, it kicks me off the game, and right back to my Kindle Fire HD' s home page, I lose my scores, coins, everything, just gone. :(<br /><br />Fix this, and this 59 year old grandma who lives video games well give it 5 stars!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a cool game I like it a lot I play it for a long time and my sister enjoys it to.
1451624468|5.0|KRAUSE HAS A WAY OF MAKING A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT NOT ONLY UNDERSTANDABLE(I WILL TREAT THIS BOOK AS A VALUABLE & GO-TO REFERRABLE TEXT) BUT ALSO INTERESTING!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Quick and easy way of checking my Facebook. I just haven't figured out how to go to my personal Facebook page.
1451683405|4.0|SAM HARRIS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE WRITERS...FREE WILL (NOT THE BOOK) IS A CONCEPT THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN DIFFICULT RATIONALIZE...&#34;FREE WILL&#34; THE BOOK IS A VALUABLE TEXT BOOK THAT IS HELPING ME TO UNDERSTAND  THAT HUMANS DO NOT HAVE FREE WILL.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this application. It informs me with the weather, personalized to my location. And lets me know when there is a severe weather alert in my area. 5 stars.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It's not my favorite Disney movie but my daughter loves it so that's why it got 5 stars. I bought it for her after all!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds is very addictive! My husband and I have lots of fun playing against each other. Very good game.
1612680011|5.0|Loved everything about this book! Soon after I finished I did Wht it told me to do..already seeing a gain an feeling better!!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use this app every day as my main way of checking my email especially on the go. Love it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is a pretty cool game over Temple Run the original.  Like the improved game path (zip lines).  Just played it for a few hours now, so I can't say for certain that the entire game is great.  But it is a little better then 1 and Brave.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game the best thing so far .. am very glad you guys have it in the kindle addition
B004EPYZSK|3.0|this movie is enjoyable but noy one you will want to see over and over again lots of people skipped it and missed out
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie's special effects looked pretty good and really made the film. But if you are looking for much depth of plot beyond that, you won't get it here. Being a science fiction author, [[ASIN:B00A9FLVIG Lucifer's Pocket]], I do understand that there is a certain amount of suspending one's disbelief required to make a plot work. Being a Navy veteran, and having written about battleships, [[ASIN:B004E3XAEW Vengeance: Hatred and Honor]], I have an understanding of what it takes to operate a ship. This film not only strained my suspending of disbelief, it broke right past it with no resistance at all. It's almost a better comedy than an action movie and I think it was intended that way. Nonetheless it was entertaining enough in that capacity that I had to watch it twice.<br /><br />If you are looking for lighthearted action entertainment this movie is for you. If you are looking for action with a realistic plot--move on, you won't find it here.
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I enjoyed the movie from being a baseball fan it was a good documentary on fixation on one way to do things
B0076DELIG|3.0|I have been a Harry Bosch fan for a very long time and was anxious to read this latest installment. But I have to say that it was disappointing. Harry is still Harry - dogged in his search for justice and struggling in his personal life. But this book didn't do anything for me. I found the plot to be transparent and telegraphed from a mile away. Even the ending didn't redeem it. I kept waiting for that \\"wow - I didn't see that coming\\" moment and it never materialized. All in all, it's OK if all you're looking for is to re-connect with a character that you enjoy, but don't expect anything special.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|great movie I enjoy the potter movies and will tell any one how likes the others this is one of the best
B0072OFOM6|5.0|A very good serie with really good impressions just as soon as you start watching. Great story, a lot of sexiness, tons of blood and adrenaline. An epic story worth to be seen.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|downey was good though the movie was a bit of a strech it had some real exciting parts acting was good
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have got this on my both iPad2 and Galaxy Siii. I am glad that I got it because now I can buy and read all kinds of books and not needed to have just kindle tablet. Thanks,
B005LAIH4A|2.0|this was a very boering movie to drawn out but chidren might like it though most loose interest quickly thats it
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is one of the best game ever made. Very challenging and exciting to play. I would highly recommend to everyone to get it and play it. Love it. Thanks,
B001UV4XIS|5.0|this one was pretty much a finail epesode for harry enjoyed and will miss the caracter and his partners goodby
B00B2V66VS|3.0|The app aloes me to play it once then the next time I try it doesn't let me so I have to re install everytime I wanna play!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|this game is too new. its weird, awkward and too modern. I have to say that I'm really disappointed w this new temple run. I don't like it at all
B00A4TKDKY|5.0|Fantastic!  Good quality recording - I listen to it often - have it on my IPod.  Album is very good - voice, selection of songs, etc.
0756655307|5.0|Everything you need and could ever want to know about superheroes and villains!! I love it oh so so much,,
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was pretty good, I enjoyed reading it and the twist at the end, although I called it before it was revealed, was a good one. It isn't, in my opinion, a book you can't put down, but I did enjoy reading it.
B009TZBEKW|5.0|This is a great album containing all of my favorite songs by Calvin Harris and then some. Great workout music, too!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderlful movie and to see life does not end when you retire---it begins--new adventures. I know I'm working on my bucket list and enjoying new adventures!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game I just got it and I'm really into it. I wish the horse didn't get tired easily though.
B00009RGBS|5.0|How can you not like Chicago? The music, the show. This was a great addition. I watch it over and over.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Spotify free plus WiFi and I have free mobile music in my garage or living room. I'm sure the app work great outside the home but I don't have a need.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|A worthy read. Good price, easy download. Perfect for anyone who wants to read about the world's most famous and best detective.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so cool I like it so much every one I know like it way better then the first temple run
0312330855|5.0|A worthy read. Good price, easy download and son enjoyed reading it very much. Would recommend it to teenager or older who enjoys animals.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|gorgeous and addictive!  i love this game so far. the animation is breathtaking  and gameplay is smooth. rewards come often and quickly.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A worthy read. Good price, easy download and son enjoyed reading it very much. Would recommend it to teenager who enjoys fantasy and/or sci-fi.
030758836X|4.0|This book is well written, it started a little slow but picks up.  It has deep character development and a twisting plot. I am sure I will love it as I read on
B003TSEL7S|5.0|A worthy read. Good price, easy download and son enjoyed reading it very much. Would recommend it to teenager who enjoys fantasy and/or sci-fi.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app because it is fun the graphics are amazing the screen is NEVER blurry and that's saying something and it is just plane fun!
B000FBFMFW|5.0|A worthy read. Good price, easy download and son enjoyed reading it very much. Would recommend it to teenager who enjoys fantasy and/or sci-fi.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am absolutely hooked on this show!  I know it is more soap opera that SCI but I can't help it.  I am so looking forward to the next episode!
0312641893|5.0|This book got me addicted from the first page. I enjoyed the modern twist on the classic tale of Cinderella. I would definitely recommend this book and awaiting for the next book to come out!
B009Z8HPYM|5.0|Definately a must have for any Neil Young fan.  Reminds me of his older stuff. Love it!  I can put  my I-Pod in my stereo I-Pod dock and watch the videos as well.  Great music to work around the house with!
B009IJJB8G|2.0|I don't why we in the US do not want to watch the original shows! The BBC' &#34;Sherlock&#34;, though only having 3 90-minute episodes per season is fantastically well written, and a true pleasure. After watching both seasons of it, I tried to feed my Sherlock need and moved on to &#34;Elementary.&#34; I will not waste any more of my time.
9562916464|5.0|This is a great basic book to keep in your reference libraries for personal or small business usage.<br />It is a quick reference for old rules which we tend to forget and good to have &#34;at hand.&#34;<br />Highly recommend it.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|If you are a Bruce Willis fan you will like Looper.  Both side of this time travel movie is in the future.  Mankind is always slips into the worst kind of world to live in.  Bad guys and technology always combine to create evil and powerful intent for greed and power.
B005I6EU7U|1.0|This case is difficult to put kindle in. The corner steps cover ports and buttons that should be accessible. It barely fits and the elastic on corner straps are stretching out already. It does look cool. I purchased it right after Christmas.
B009X01D9U|5.0|This case works perfect for the kindle HD 8.9&#34;  I like how it can turn from portrait to landscape quickly.  I mostly use it in landscape mode though.  It has an area on the inside you can put a wipe for cleaning off the fingerprints off of the screen.  The strap works well to keep it closed during transport and when you open the case it automatically brings up the unlock screen.  Couldn't wish for anything better.
0143120530|5.0|I really liked this book, so much that I read it from beginning to end in a few hours. Josh really did his research via literature and most importantly through his experience. I liked his writing style. While the techniques he described in the book weren't in full detail, it was enough that I could see myself learning more about them and practicing them. Josh will be visiting UCSB on March 4th and I'm really excited to meet him.
B0041D843M|5.0|I very much enjoyed reading this book. It reinforces the facts that I knew and have me new information to help change my children's diet slowly and effectively.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|It is good and has old action movies faces enough to attract the audience.<br />O liked it even if it is a violent movie (Guns.)
