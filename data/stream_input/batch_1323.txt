0321334876|3.0|This book does give you some specific ideas and ways to write better C++ code. But I'd read a section a couple times and have to talk to a friend to really figure out what they meant and how to do it. So overall I found the suggestions very good, but it would have been nicer if the explanations and code samples had been clearer.

B000QGAU4E|5.0|I was thrilled to take a speculative fiction class at UC Berkeley and find that this film was among those assigned as homework (along with \\"Gattaca\\" and \\"Bladerunner\\"). There are a few films that I will watch repeatedly and this is one. There is a rawness and harshness to the imagery, dialogue and at times, music. All of it blends well together in my opinion. I catch more and more symbolism each time I watch it ... the barn scene, the mention of high pitch noise that eventually fades (and later when the audio of a high pitch note coincides with a particular scene). There is much to catch while watching this movie and therein lies the beauty.<br />If you are curious about whether you will like this movie or not, rather then telling you my favorite movies, I suggest you give it a try. Like reality, it is beautiful, dark, moving, raw, ugly and harsh.
B005LCECU6|4.0|This is an incredible recording of early Rush. As noted in another review, the panning of Alex's guitar gets a little tired but it doesn't really detract from the overall sound. The only real complaint I have is that the three 'bonus' tracks weren't recorded with as much care as the main program. It was great hearing the beginnings of By-Tor in the Working Man jam. I consider this a must have for fans of early Rush. Much better, in my opinion, than Live In Cleveland.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|\\"I wanted to be the greatest birder in the world.\\" Stu (Martin), Brad (Black), and defending champion Bostick (Wilson) have all decided to the the \\"Big Year\\" (a year long competitive bird watching event). In the middle of trying to become the next world champion all three face decisions that are much bigger then the birds. I have said many times that I think about 80% of the way you feel about a movie is based off of expectations about it going in. This is one that I was not looking forward to. A movie about bird watching with Jack Black (I have never been a big fan of his) did not sound appealing to me. Halfway through this movie (and Jack Black) won me over and I really enjoyed this. This movie was about so much more then bird watching. Dealing with some very heavy issues and as much of a drama as a comedy this is a movie very much worth watching. I recommend this. Overall, a good movie and much better then I expected. I don't think I'd watch it again though. I give it a B+.
B0015DROBO|3.0|I really did enjoy this book, but not until I got past the somewhat boring backstory. I disagree when I hear that this book celebrates rape and torture. Just because a book doesn't have a paragraph devoted to actually denouncing these acts doesn't mean it's celebrating them. These horrible acts fuel the story and the personalities of the book. There seem to be a few cliche lines sprinkled throughout the book. But overall it's a solid read. I would recommend it for anybody that enjoys dark tales. I will likely read the next book in the series.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this doll for my 16 month old Grand daughter for Christmas. She loves her and she goes with her everywhere. The doll is not too big and I like that there is not \\"hair\\" on its head, making her easy to clean and manage. Her body is fabric with plastic legs and arms and head, which makes her soft and easy to grab. As long as her head stays tied on tight, I see this being a favorite toy for a long time. There isn't really a smell to her, now that she is out of the box, which I like. She is highly priced, and there are other dolls that are close, for less, but I feel this was a good choice for her.  I bought a feeding set and diaper bag set for her doll too, so this new \\"mommy\\" can take care of her. Also, I made an extra set of pj's so she can be changed. This has been a great part of her fun!

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I finished reading Pride and Prejudice and immediately checked out the Colin Firth BBC series as well as this film from my local library.  I watched this film first since it was only slightly shorter than the BBC series from the mid 90s.<br /><br />The film stays pretty true to the nature of the book, with some few exceptions.  Mainly there are many moments from the book which could not possibly make it into a 2 hour film.  Several characters were cut entirely, such as Maria and Sir William Lucas.  The two visits to Catherine de Bourg's estate were condensed into one.  And there are a few added scenes where the film takes some liberty.  All in all though, the changes made were good for the pace and continuity of the film.  The only odd scene was when Lizzy confronted Darcy about Jane and Bingly and Wickham.  He actually gives half of his response there, then the other half is contained in a letter (like the book). But the half response kind of takes something away from that moment as described in the novel.<br /><br />The acting is very good.  I liked the casting for most of the main characters.  Donald Sutherland was an odd choice, but he worked as Mr Bennett.  Kiera Knightly is very good as Lizzy; she embodies the under appreciated attractiveness that is described in the novel, especially compared to her more obviously and classically attractive sister Jane.  Knightly embodies the fire and the tomboy style of Lizzy's character very well.<br /><br />I am most happy with the actor who played Darcy.  He is very good at the brooding, yet firm resolution of Darcy's character.  He has the tall, rugged handsomeness that Austen describes.<br /><br />The production quality is what I liked about this film over the drab and overly dark (just bad contrast, not anything with the lighting) BBC series.  Where the BBC series looks like a DVD made from one of those VHS dubbing to DVD devices, this film shines with dramatic settings, and quality film making.  Granted they had the budget to do so!  But with great cinematography, a quality soundtrack, and terrific casting, this is easily my favorite Pride and Prejudice adaptation (over the Laurence Olivier film and the BBC series).graphy, a quality soundtrack, and terrific casting, this is easily my favorite Pride and Prejudice adaptation (over the Laurence Olivier film and the BBC series).

0385535139|4.0|I love John Grisham -- because I read him from the beginning when his novels were fresh and surprising and always meaningful.  Like a few others, I was not as enamamored of a few recent ones and was downright disappointed with Innocent Man.  But, I bought The Litigators anyway because I am an optimist.  I waited until the chaos of the holidays were over and settled in for a good winter read.  And I got it! The team of Finley, Figg and finally Zinc had me laughing, hoping, and truly turning the pages.  It was not one that you had to read all in one night, but it was one tht you did have to finish.  Way to go, John.  I was worried that you had jumped on the bandwagon, aleady crowded, of those authors who lend their names to a book that is mostly written by another.  Not so.  Heartily recommend.
B001FB55Y4|5.0|I am not someone who likes to glorify violence or criminals but this film was so much fun. From the beginning to the end this film goes in full throttle with fun and excitement and even laughs. Basically this is a typical British comedy of errors but instead of stuffy old ladies and pish-posh gentlemen it is criminal gangs, mobsters and international terrorists!<br /><br />To give a bit of a plot description would actually be too cumbersome here but basically the theme and plots revolves around which bad guy is fooling whom. It is multi-layered and complicated at times and you need to pay attention or you will get lost quickly. The ensemble cast is terrific and even the \\"ugly\\" people are full of charisma. I also have to say even though they don't get top billing Mark Strong and especially Thandie Newton nearly steal the show. There is a scene where Thandie is dancing and lets just say she has got some \\"good\\" moves. It is also one of the most fun scenes in the film.<br /><br />This film is not going to be on any critics lists of best films BUT it is definitely in my top twenty favourite films of all time.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I wanted to give a quick update on this film. I have recently ordered the Blu-ray version and I was very surprised to see the difference between the two. The DVD had a beautiful picture but this was even better. It was so clear it was almost uncomfortable seeing the detail in people's faces like skin pours and facial hair. Anyway, worth the extra few bob for sure BUT the DVD is just fine. I don't think you lose anything with the DVD you just gain a wee bit with the Blu-ray.

B006ZBRMOU|4.0|This book was enjoyable, but not as powerful as book 2. There were definite highs and lows, but I felt that the author was trying to wrap everything up in a tidy little box with a cute little bow on top. Basically after 2 books of sneak peaks into the psyche of an emotionally unbalanced guy, we are to believe that Christian is just so much better now. This book had the fewest mention of Dr. Flynn. While he has clearly grown from Book 1, he still has a long way to go. He has given Anna more of himself, but he still does manipulative things i.e., making sure she kept her bathing suit on. Stuff like that made me shake my head and mumble \\"here we go again\\".<br /><br />What I loved about the book: I saw the breaking down of just about all the walls that Christian had erected around himself. Especially the last couple of chapters. The epilogue clearly showed that Anna was still helping Christian to address and deal with his past. Yeeeaa Ana! And Kudos to Christian for being willing to listen.<br /><br />I loved a particular phrase Christian used to describe their sexual relationship. He said to Anna, \\"You know, you're topping from the bottom\\". I think this was realization of the nature of their emotional relationship. Even though Anna was younger, she was emotionally more mature in some ways, than Christian. Before Ana, all Christian knew about sex was the whole Dom/Sub hierarchy. There was never a sharing or mutual pleasure until Ana. With Ana, Christian was able to begin truly experiencing life, whether it was painful or pleasurable. He just learned to feel. He even allowed his mom to comfort him. This must be why the author called it \\"Fifty Shades Freed.\\" Ana freed him to feel again.<br /><br />I would have liked more scenes where they talked about her high school, or her favorite songs or her favorite sport. I wanted more focus on her tending to her own needs, but Everyone's attention was always on pleasing Christian. Even in the epilogue, Ana is still apologizing to Christian. Ana's whole goal in life was to \\"save\\" Christian. But there was a lot of progress considering it has been just 3 months since Ana got to know him. In the end, they were still standing. I saw a happy couple, who accepted each other faults and all. It wasn't easy, but they were learning to fight and work it out.<br /><br />With that said, this was a happy ending for a series filled with such angst. The story ended on a high note, with even the siblings in a relationship. Heck, even Taylor is in love. I have to applaud the author, Ms. E.L James for writing such a poignant book. Whether you loved it or not, it evoked strong emotions in the reader. Book 2 will always be my favorite though.life was to \\"save\\" Christian.

145162445X|1.0|This is a case of learning gone totally awry. Scientific concepts are replaced by high -sounding theories and explanation that defy real logic. The very simplest things have a maker but the complex universe does not? The information and  explanations in this book leave me unsatisfied. Sort of like junk food as opposed to a nutritious meal.
0684135051|5.0|This is not the book to learn to knit, purl, cast on, or cast off.  It assumes that you already know how to do that.  If you want to knit a classic sweater that will be as fashionable twenty years from now as it is today, buy this book.  Read it carefully, take the appropriate measurements, do your arithmetic for the percentage method, and start knitting.  I bought my copy about twenty years ago, and I still refer to it.  If EZ says something works, it does.  This book is worth every penny, even if some of the patterns aren't in the current fashion.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|Some of you may be wondering whether INVICTA is a Swiss made watch. Let's not beat around the bush here. INVICTA is an American company that doesn't make its watches in Switzerland (possibly in Asia). Having said that, the quality of these watches is very high and I am very proud of my choice of INVICTA #1513 model.<br /><br />The watch comes in a very impressive box, which if you are considering gifting it, makes a very good impression. Inside the box, the watch hugs a little pillow - similar to the way my Raymond Weil came.<br /><br />The size of the watch is optimized enough to get other people's attention. I was asked several times what is the type of the watch and my hand attracted enough eyeing from my peers during meetings, or other events.<br /><br />The watch is water resistant and the numbers and hands glow in the dark, so you won't wonder in the middle of the night what time it is. The chronograph works perfectly. It tracks to the 1/10th of a second, the second, and the minutes.<br /><br />Overall, great value for the cost. I highly recommend it.

1451627289|5.0|I've read numerous books by Stephen King, but by no means am I a Steven King \\"freak.\\"  I just love to read. And 11.22.63 is one of the most brilliantly written novels I've ever read. (Lonesome Dove is my favorite all time.)  This book moved me to tears like few others and I loved the story, fragility of the time concept, the characters and most of all, the love of George for Sadie!  The love of JFK also comes through. His death moved our generation from a generation stoked with confidence and optimism to a vastly ugly, more negative one fraught with pessimism, loss and distrust. Then came Vietnam....Nixon...  The prospect of his JFK's survival opens up the possibility of incredible changes in history.  Your son did a great job on the ending, too!  Stephen;  Thank you for sharing this masterpiece!

0380789019|5.0|This was the first work by Neil Gaiman I had read a few years after it had come out. As a friend was a great fan of his, I read this upon his recommendation. I was not familiar with Sandman at the time, so I went in with no preconceived notions. Gaiman strikes a great balance between outright fantasy and our regular, everyday world. His settings come alive as they are extensions or distortions of what we already know, and his characters are painted with a broad brush, inhabiting these spaces in ways we cannot know in our everyday lives.  A blurb from Tori Amos inside the books states, \\"I'm over the moon for this book\\". I've often felt the same way about it. Over the years, I've managed to introduce people unfamiliar with Neil to his writing using this book as a gateway, and like me, they always feel the same way. This has become one of my favorite novels by any author and I highly recommend it.
B005RK6EUS|4.0|I've been really anticipating the final episode of season 6, and it did not disappoint!! I think it's in my top 3 faves from the last two seasons. Moffat is a great writer. While most of the secrets and surprises of season 6 were spoiled for me - perusing the Whovian webscape one can't help but run into major spoilers - I wanted to be sure I watched \\"The Wedding of River Song\\" before anyone spoiled the remaining secrets and surprises for me - success!! Anyhow, I hope you enjoy it, too. I love the doctor!! Cross my hearts.
0743297334|5.0|How did Hemingway do it? How did he just put the simplest of words together, words that anyone might use, yet in such a way that shall always haunt and transcend? \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" epitomizes Hemingway's effortless, aesthetically athletic prose ... though some could easily argue that \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" was such an epitome. The most interesting character in the story may be Lady Ashley, a deliciously decadent, charmingly complicated, and irresistibly intellectual, ethereal woman. The relationship between she and Jake is nostalgically impossible, yet quixotically optimistic, with perhaps the greatest culminating line in all of literature, \\"Isn't it pretty to think so?\\" However, the witty, eccentric banter between the main characters is enough to keep readers turning pages for centuries. Anyone who thinks that Hemingway's work may be cynical, in my humble opinion, has not read the likes of this simple and deep and remarkable novel.

0896762173|5.0|I purchased this book because I was hoping to find some inside detail of how the clothing of earlier era's were constructed, and this book did not disappoint.  I was concerned about the description that indicated that the book was comprised of 'drawings' but when I received the book I was impressed and amazed by the detail.  I must admit that there are times when I am so taken by the drawing detail that the construction was overlooked!  This is one of the most amazing books I own, and I it is one that I return to time and time again when I have construction questions.  If I were to change one thing...I would wish for an actual photo of the item to correspond with the illustration, then it would be totally perfect!

B004A8ZWXS|5.0|In Dartmoor, England a teenage boy named Albert Narracott (Jeremy Irvine), watches in fascination as a thoroughbred colt is born. The baby horse is a beautiful animal and watching the equine run through the fields soon becomes Albert's new hobby. The day comes when the horse is taken to auction. Albert's father, Ted (Peter Mullan) comes to market to buy a plow horse, but when he sees the magnificent beast and spots his landlord smirking on the other side of the fence he ends up paying a small fortune to purchase the animal. Albert names the horse Joey and sets to training the animal. When the landlord threatens to take the family farm, Albert trains the animal to wear a horse collar and plow a field. However, when a destructive storm ruins the family's turnip crop, Ted is forced to sell the horse to the British cavalry for the war that has just been declared (1914). The animal is purchased by Captain Nicholls (Tom Hiddleston) who promises Albert that Joey will be his personal mount and he will return the horse to him after the war. It's off to France and after a foolish offensive Joey loses his mount and is captured by the Germans. What follows is an extraordinary journey for Joey as he changes hands from one owner to the next. The horse has a remarkable spirit of determination and raises to every challenge that comes before it. Meanwhile, Albert has joined the Army and is fighting on the Western front and carries with him an illustration of Joey. He's convinced they will find each other again.<br /><br />WAR HORSE is an impressive movie. Visually, the film is a cinematic kaleidoscope of stunning wonder. It's like watching a Terrence Malick film, but with an actual story and lots of action.<br /><br />The main character in the story is Joey, so if you don't like horses, you might not like the film. However, the human actors all do a fine job. Some of them are only on screen for a few minutes in a couple of scenes, but each of them excellently portrays the emotional depth of their characters. There are some who might say that the movie is filled with characterizations and no real acting, but this isn't the case. Most of the acting in the movie isn't done in broad gestures and over articulation. Instead, the real acting happens in the small moments: the way the eyes light up, the gentle turn of the head, etc. For instance, there is a scene where a German regiment invades a small farm and takes everything away from the farmer and his granddaughter who live there. There really isn't much action that happens in this scene and there aren't many words. However, volumes are spoken between the characters in how they say things and in the little things they do. WAR HORSE is filled with scenes like that.<br /><br />Even if you aren't a horse or animal person, you can take a lot away from WAR HORSE. Though a horse is the main and title character, the movie is really about hope, perseverance, and determination. It is a story about the deep friendship between two kindred spirits. It's an ancient story that's been told again and again throughout history (the Biblical story of Joseph, ODYSSEY, THE AENIED, E.T., etc.). It's a story that resonates because it touches something deep within each of us. It's a grand old story, but in WAR HORSE it's just told through the eyes of a horse and his boy.cters.

B000000W5B|3.0|Goats Head Soup begins the mid-seventies triad of releases from the band which were hit and miss affairs, for the most part. After the high ride of the Stones' renaissance period(68-72), when Goats was released in August of '73, it contained a record that was still varied, yet the overall outcome was, to me, half-hearted and lackadaisal. Opening with Dancing with Mr D., its lead by Keith's riffing with some slide from Mick Taylor accompanying and Jagger follows up the dark ambience with a lyric and vocal that seems tongue in cheek; yeah, we're dealing with the Devil again, but this ain't no Sympathy for the Devil part II, mind you! 100 Years Ago has tempo changes within its songcraft that gives a somewhat blunted quality to it; regardless, Mick Taylor rides the song out with some killer wah-wah guitar playing, and I would say, this is where Taylor began to fit really nicely within the Stones on record. Keith sings on the next number, a soft country-soul tune called Comin Down Again, which, although has a certain warmth to its own, is slightly meandering and boring. Heartbreaker and Angie remain the most memorable tracks for casual fans and are the main hit singles drawn from the album; Heartbreaker is famous for its horn arrangement and doo doo doo chorus wrapped within a song that has a rockin boogie rollin', while Angie was the love ballad of the record and pushed Goats Head into the Top Ten.<br /><br />Silver Train kicks things off with a track deep-heeled in blues/rock and is another showcase for Mick Taylor to show off his slide guitar prowess; the band cooks and chugs along nicely on this song. Hide Your Love is an R&B piano driven track played mostly by Jagger and the inspired soloing of Taylor, which is really the appeal of this, somewhat, \\"basic\\" song. Winter is ballad number two on here and is not as popular as Angie, but it succeeds well on its own merits; as a matter of fact, I find this song to be a hidden gem within this mixed feel of the record. Can You Hear the Music is the oddball track here as it contains elements of studio wizardry within the vocals, and the basic theme of the song is of a plodding melody which is definitely of a lesser quality here; I don't care how much Nicky Hopkins tries to rescue the song with his piano, its still a subpar track to me! Star Star ends the album on a rockin' note in which Keith recycles another Chuck Berry rip-off riff with a straightforward chugging precision. Overall, Goats Head is the wake of what Exile had done(which was their recording zenith) in closing a particular chapter in the Stones' career up to that point. In some respects this album is forgivable in that light, on the other hand, it is also a bit subpar. 3 stars

1606865617|2.0|This looks like a book that English teachers would inflict on students because of its \\"brilliant use of language.\\" And while I have to agree that there are some amazing phrases, the bulk of it is filled with overblown prose that adds nothing to the storyline - if you can find the storyline, that is. I got tired of looking, so quit before I got halfway through it. The author wanders down rabbit trails that have nothing to do with the story, and the characters are never developed enough to evoke any concern about what happens to them. I wanted to like this book, I just couldn't.

B004Q0SQ24|5.0|These toys are bright and cheerful, and fun to play with.  They are something of a wood hybrid plastic monstrosity, but they are definetly among the best products of the Chuggington line.  I prefer Thomas track and wooden destinations, but these toys make great invaders.  They will not fit under all tunnels, but there are plenty of other products you can buy that will.  I treat them as welcome guests to my son's train table.  Don't forget that Wilson is included in two of the starter sets.
B006GG1KOC|1.0|I believe the devoloper has intentionally made it easy for your child when in the app to purchase additional apps. It's just plain wrong!
B004HHKFIY|5.0|This is the best of the Chuggington line.  These toys are bright and vibrant half plasic-half wood monstrosities.  Even if you are plastic adverse like me these little engines are a great pickup.  There are plenty of more woody products out there if you shop around.  They are oversize and won't fit through small tunnels, don't hook up perfectly with smaller trains.  Consider buying the clocktower set and Brewster or pick up the Wilson/Brewster starting set and Koko.  Hopefully we will see more variety in the wood line later!
1451627289|3.0|Started out great.. Suspenseful and intriguing for the first two hundred pages or so, then fell fell flat and boring for about five hundred pages.. Finally picking up the pace with about eighty pages left for a good ending.. I found the characters growing more and more annoying as the story wore on.. Seemed to me that King saw a squirrel and got sidetracked with the love story and by the time 11-22-63 came around he was running out of ink and decided to just photocopy a page out of his junior high history book, then just wrapped it up without climax.. However, I did enjoy his take on time travels effect and consequences at the very end.. 5 star beginning, 1.5 star from then on til the 4 star finish.. If you want a thousand page book about a guy going back in time to be a phenomenal school teacher who falls in love, with a decimal point of suspense, then by all means this is the book for you!!
B006IVBSBU|5.0|I don't have a lot to add after reading Grady Harp's review.  The film moved at a very nice clip and did a VERY effective job showing how a global pandemic \\"might\\" actually occur.  It will definitely make you think about food storage and emergency preparedness!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app. a lot of fun games to play. once you start playing its hard to put it down. I highly reccomend it
B003YGSLDA|5.0|This is THE BEST Santa movie. The sound track is very good and listening through large speakers adds to its impact.  The Santa's sleigh take-offs are brilliant.  Dudley Moore as Patch the elf is terrific.  Watch this movie and become a kid again.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Great microphones for the price . Built solid , nice weight . I bought 2 and they sound great . These mics could go head to head with the other pricier mic...<br />The ones I received were actually all black . Real nice flat finish . I have no complaints about that as they look great .
B005CMSDKA|3.0|From the trailer, I expected a hell of an action movie, but within the first few minutes (the crazy rotating camera scene), I already knew that wasn't going to be the case.  As an action movie, it falls short, but it's still plenty watchable. The few fight scenes there are, are sweet. The characters are nice, though they don't seem to connect well with each other, so everything ends up feeling detached. There are many shots that I guess would be classified as 'artsy' or 'psychadelic', and as I'm not a huge fan of those, all of those shots just fell flat with me.  I wish I could say I liked this movie more, but something about the main character just pushes you (the watcher) away instead of connecting you with her, and thus that angle is gone. The story is so-so, and could have been expanded in places, but I suppose it was satisfactory within the movie's span. The ending ('Just missed your heart') was blatantly telegraphed and just wound up feeling cheesy.  This movie is a rental at best. Somewhere between a 5-6/10 from me.
B002VECM6S|3.0|This is a new movie and all new movies usually have Closed Caption but this one did not. I was really disappointed. I am hard of hearing and in order to keep from bothering other family members and turning my television to loud I always use close caption but I couldn't with this movie. Must of been a cheaper addition  I like the movie but I was not happy about the lack of closed caption.

1576754227|5.0|Stop whining about your overwhelming workload--and listen up! Author Brian Tracy has good news and bad news for you. \\"...the fact is that you are never going to get caught up. You will never get on top of your tasks. You will never get far enough ahead to be able to get to all those books, magazines, and leisure time activities that you dream of.\\"<br /><br />The author and executive coach adds, \\"And forget about solving your time management problems by becoming more productive. No matter how many personal productivity techniques you master, there will always be more to do than you can ever accomplish in the time you have available to you, no matter how much it is.\\"<br /><br />The good news? Frogs!<br /><br />He quotes Mark Twain's wit and wisdom, \\"Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.\\"<br /><br />So Tracy serves up two frog rules and 21 ways to stop procrastinating and accomplish more in less time.<br /><br />Frog Rule #1. \\"If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first.\\"<br /><br />Frog Rule #2. \\"If you have to eat a live frog at all, it doesn't pay to sit and look at it for very long.\\"<br /><br />Time management books are a dime a dozen.  So what's different about this one--and why should you read it?<br /><br />Instead of tasting the frogs, taste these chapter titles:<br />  --Apply the 80/20 Rule to Everything<br />  --Practice Creative Procrastination<br />  --Focus on Key Result Areas<br />  --Upgrade Your Key Skills<br /><br />I recommend books that align with my 20 buckets (core competencies).  They must also have alignment with the best leadership and management writers.  The author references Peter Drucker, Stephen Covey and others whose works complement this must-read procrastination fix-it book.<br /><br />My friend and mentor, George Duff, reads Drucker's [[ASIN:0060833459 The Effective Executive: The Definitive Guide to Getting the Right Things Done (Harperbusiness Essentials)]] (\\"know your time\\") once a year.  Covey's four quadrant diagram in [[ASIN:0743269519 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]] is mentally tattooed on my forehead. A look in the mirror reminds me: Am I focused on the correct quadrant? Several clients report that [[ASIN:0142000280 Getting Things Done: The Art of Stress-Free Productivity]], by David Allen, has dramatically changed their daily productivity.<br /><br />So...what do you read every year, especially in January, to keep yourself and your team members focused on Priority #1?  Try Tracy's book. You can read it in about 90 minutes (117 pages)--and the 21 short chapters with two \\"Eat That Frog!\\" next steps are perfect for a weekly \\"Procrastinators Anonymous\\" self-help meeting.  (\\"Hi. My name is John and I'm a procrastinator. Please pass the donuts.\\")<br /><br />If you've conquered procrastination, you will still find the 21 strategies valuable--especially as you coach others. \\"One strategy might be effective in one situation and another might apply to another task. All together, these 21 ideas represent a smorgasbord of personal effectiveness techniques that you can use at any time, in any order or sequence that makes sense to you at the moment.\\"<br /><br />The one-liners are memorable--and poster-worthy:<br />  --\\"Goals are the fuel in the furnace of achievement.\\"<br />  --\\"Just find out what other successful people do and do the same things until you get the same results. Learn from the experts.\\"<br />  --\\"One of the very worst uses of time is to do something very well that need not be done at all.\\"<br />  --\\"Before you begin scrambling up the ladder of success, make sure it is leaning against the right building.\\" (Stephen Covey)<br />  --\\"It only takes about 10 to 12 minutes for you to plan out your day, but this small investment of time will save you up to two hours (100 to 120 minutes) in wasted time and diffused effort throughout the day.\\"<br />  --\\"Resist the temptation to clear up small things first.\\"<br />  --\\"Time management is really life management, personal management. It is really taking control of the sequence of events.\\"<br /><br />Somehow, we always get payroll out on time!  Brian Tracy's Law of Forced Efficiency says, \\"There is never enough time to do everything, but there is always enough time to do the most important thing.\\" How effectively do you manage your time?<br /><br />And finally, this myth-buster: The author writes, \\"Under the pressure of deadlines, often self-created through procrastination, people suffer greater stress, make more mistakes, and have to redo more tasks than under any other conditions.\\" Have you believed the myth that you're more productive under deadline pressures?<br /><br />Idea: buy a dozen books to share with your team members. Delegate to a point person who will recruit people for five-minute chapter summaries at each of your next 21 staff meetings.>  --\\"Time management is really life management, personal management.

B0062NAX1U|2.0|No sub titles for the hearing impaired.  If you love a Promise Keepers theme then you'll love this movie.  My wife said she liked the movie.  I got extremely bored watching this preachy movie, that is until the sermon, I mean story got to the cops vs bad guys action scene at the very end.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|ok this is a great app and upon reading the other reviews i just wanted to clarify the part about needing wifi use the app. there is an option to download the translation you want so that when your not on wifi you can have it. there is endless translations and if your on wifi u can highlite take notes and share favorite scriptures its a very easy app
B003Y5HWK4|3.0|I read a review where the complaint was that whenever that person tried to click on \\"Episodes\\" nothing happened.  It happened to me too.  In fact my player froze up.  I have to use the Play All to watch an episode which is a pain because you have to fast track the previous episode already viewed.  You  would think for the price paid for the Blu-ray someone could have taken the time to insure that the disc played the way it should.  I only have watched one episode so far but I think its great.  I loved the Sopranos and I know I will love the rest of the episodes.  Maybe the season two blu-ray will work the way it should. I wonde if the DVD version has this problem.  If this is a major problem for Blu-ray disc than the product should be recalled and new ones sent to all.  Patrick
B005XQLBU4|2.0|The game is a lot of fun. It would be better if there was a way to exit on the Galaxy Nexus.

B004FOA84A|4.0|My first game of this type. I had to Google some clues! Pretty fun, but only took me a few hours to solve, even getting stuck. If you like clue - driven solve the problem games, you should get it! If not, then probably still with a try, I liked it.
B0062KJ1Q6|3.0|Im taking the middle road here.  I am glad that I did not ignore this one.  It came up on .99 and I liked all the actors so gave it a try.  I went back to read the reviews and was surprised that so many rated this so low.  Maybe some were expecting another FB, but when I saw who was in this, and based on the R rating, am surprised that people will rate a movie low based on language, ect. when its clearly to be expected.<br />I found it fun and yes, funny and enjoyed watching it play out.  The characters played off each other well, the direction was good. Nothing too unexpected, but kept me watching and interested.<br />If you arent afraid of an R rating, and you know what to expect from that, I would disregard those that rated it poorly on that merit alone.<br />Fun group!
B004Q1FDHO|4.0|Great for killing time while standing in line at amusement parks! Doesn't take much thought, but fun to blow up fish!

B005XQLBU4|5.0|fun retro game for those that remember the original missile command. my only gripe is the accuracy though I think that's more of an issue with the touch sensitivity of my tablet (nook color running ics).
0439023521|3.0|I guess I don't get why these books are so popular. I haven't read them, but from the description it just sounds like a rip off of Battle Royale. Or maybe somewhat of a rip off of Lord Of The Flies. Why can't people come up with any original ideas anymore? Don't reward banality and infringement people. C'mon.
0061992860|5.0|What can you say.  This is the Bible of Survival.<br /><br />So many others have said it so well. the SAS Survival Guide is more than worthy to add to your library or 3 day assault bag!  I love the size as it is just right for any pocket you would like to put it in.<br /><br />I can see myself wearing it out!  :0)
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Help, if you haven't already heard all the hype, is an AMAZING movie.  It is a  heart warming and touching story as one girl defies all of societies rules to help those who never had an opportunity to say how they felt, to finally speak out.  A must watch and a must own on dvd.
0393064476|5.0|Am very happy with the item condition and the speed of delivery during the busy holiday season!  The price was also very reasonable.  There were not many sources for this book, either.

B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I was hooked and couldn't put this book down.  It was thrilling and a great love story.  However, I was very dissappointed in the last few chapters.  I chose to read this book because I expected a happy love story, but the ending really upset me.
0062101897|5.0|Having been a huge fan of the Harry Potter world since the first book was released, I have been very upset with the void left in my life from both the books and movies being complete. But, luckily, this book helps fill the gap. It is so interesting to read how the makers of the film translated such a wonderful series into epic movie experiences. My favorite part has to be looking at the large picture and descriptions of some of the props, and how much detail went into each piece of the movie. I can not wait to go back and look at the movies so I can find the smaller details. I also have enjoyed this book because it explains why they had to deviate from the book at different points (not all deviations are explained though), and it makes it the book nerd in me a little less upset with the changes upon hearing why some of the magic from the book could simply not be translated to the screen. Overall, this book is a great buy for anyone who loves the magical world of Harry Potter.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another GREAT book by Nicholas Sparks.  You will fall in love with the characters!  I love reading books when they are going to made into a movie and this was an amazing book with a great story.  Can't wait for the movie!
0670022705|5.0|Ordered this book for my husband for  Christmas in November from another company.  Still wasn't here in January.  Amazon wrote the company was no longer doing business with them.  Reordered from Muffin lord and the book seemed to magically appear.  Great, fast service. Will look for that name when I order again.  Judy
0307592731|4.0|Cheryl Strayed chose her last name well, as rarely have I read an account by anyone who wandered so far off the path of sober reasoning.<br /><br />I will say at the outset that I found it difficult to put this book down for very long. A colorful, dynamic, and at times harrowing account of one woman in search of self, this book doesn't disappoint in the thrills department. There is a constant need, however, to question her decisions in everything from her cavalier use of drugs, to her aimless and frequent trips back and forth to different parts of the country in her attempts to find that one perfect place to settle.<br /><br />In her defense, it appears that she got off on a shaky start in childhood, with an abusive and neglectful father (who disappears from her life mercifully early) and a free-spirited mother with also a questionable and unorthadox approach to motherhood. Her mother is her anchor, and when she loses that anchor fairly early, she takes a slide into the abyss.<br /><br />There are a series of bad and peremptory choices; an ill-thought-out early marriage, a succession of interim partners, and then her epiphany of hiking the Pacific Crest Trail - alone and without any training or physical preparation.<br /><br />I am frankly amazed that this young woman survived her various trials and travails relatively unscathed; she really must have had angels watching over her on her long hike. This is a trip even stalwart single men would think twice about (thought there were several she encountered); it was a year of unusual snow in the mountains, treacherous footing, the possiblity of dangerous wildlife; not for the faint of heart. There are enough horror stories about lone hikers who disappear. I can't think that any untried, previously non-hiking person would attempt such a thing alone, yet she managed to succeed in her goal.<br /><br />For sheer perseverance, she deserves kudos, and I have to admit, there are few dull pages, althought the angst is pretty thick in a lot of places. It was something of a hare-brained plan; I'm glad she made it to write about it.brained plan; I'm glad she made it to write about it.
0071762345|5.0|Do you want to be inspired and find great, low cost ways to boost your social media?  Then buy this book.  I liked it so much, I bought it for our entire social media group here at work.<br /><br />\\"Likeable Social Media\\" offers very common sense approaches to social media - how to build your presence, create affinity and to counter less enlightened bosses - and each chapter ends with exercises to help you distill your ideas into an action plan.<br /><br />I can't recommend this one highly enough.

0307959856|4.0|P.D. James is one of the great mystery writers. Her books are psychologically dark and dense, humanely subtle and complex. Long before I started reviewing and writing books, she was the author I had to read each time she published a new book.<br /><br />Her latest takes a decidedly different direction. Instead of contemporary England, she has set this one at Pemberley estate in 1803, six years after Miss Elizabeth Bennet has married Darcy. That is, P.D. James takes the prose of Jane Austen as her setting.<br /><br />P.D. James has an excellent ear. When she writes in Austen's mode, she does so with incredible exactitude. The tone and diction sound as if lifted from the pages of Pride and Prejudice. While I fully recognize the torture I inflicted on teenage boys by requiring them to read Pride and Prejudice when I taught high school English, some of us in the world adore Austen. There is something of a cottage industry of imitators of Austen these days. I've avoided most of them for one reason or another, mostly time shortage. But when a master like P.D. James joined the cause, I bit. She didn't disappoint me.<br /><br />James goes beyond skillful imitation (which would be challenging enough in and of itself), but the hybrid she creates feels at times like strange bedfellows. Even P.D. James admits in her author's note that death and murder are not the stuff of Austen. James's customary darkness never feels to me quite at home with the light if cynical tone that Austen strikes even in her most tragic moments. A Picasso set next to a Vermeer are both still delightful to examine, and the juxtaposition can actually illuminate both. Reading Death Comes to Pemberley was a bit like that, two masters at work, but on separate projects that somehow got jumbled together at the publishers.  One minute James has you lost in Austen's language and worldview. The next she's bent over a bloody corpse or elaborating on police procedures at the opening of the 19th century--not Austen-like at all. One other smaller note: Of such elaborations on various background topics, there were perhaps too many and they were not organically integrated into the flow of the tale. Austen never needs to go into such exegesis, but we understand her world without difficulty. I think James could have trusted us to do without some of this information.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, and I recommend it if you happen to love both P.D. James and Austen, but be aware of the disjuncture you may sometimes languish in. Watching a master at work is engaging, especially when she tries something audacious and remarkable. It doesn't have to be completely successful to be worth the attempt.note: Of such elaborations on various background topics, there were perhaps too many and they were not organically integrated into the flow of the tale.

B004LROUW2|2.0|Most of the reviews I read were glowing so I was disappointed to find that I just couldn't stay interested. This was my first Murakami novel and I can't say that I'm itching to read another. I have NEVER left a book 700 pages in for ANY reason. It doesn't matter if the book has a slow plot, is boring, easily predictable, whatever... but this one was so redundant that I couldn't take it any more. The world the author creates is fascinating and magical, but the book just does NOT move. As much as I would love to know what happens at the end of the book, I just couldn't keep reading. I usually finish a book in 3-4 days and 10 days later I am finally throwing in the towel. Apparently if you are not a Murakami fan before this, you probably won't be one after. Glad I got this as a library book, but wish I had all that reading time back to have read something more interesting or just fun.

B003G4W49C|1.0|This book is a kids book masquerading as serious reading.  It is not worth the paper it is printed on.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The book was well written with a tremendous amount of detail.  Just when you think you have it all figured out, it gains a new twist.  Absolutely loved it and had a hard time putting it down.
031603438X|3.0|Well,I thought it was a better read than Clapton's autobio,but then that's not a big stretch.The constant drugtaking,alcohol excesses & the quite unnecessary foul language used for most of the book wore me out and started to bore me half-way through.I guess that's how it was,but it didn't entertain me as much as I had hoped.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Very addicting games! Can't put them down. A few are pretty challenging. A good time killer for sure. Kindle Fire
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This is a great classic game with a twist. You can rebuild with the funds you earn through successful defense of the city.

160094048X|3.0|My main gripe with this book is they don't actually show a picture of each cookie. And, for some recipes, they keep showing the same cookie (that is not the one from the recipe!!) Other than that, there is great variety here in the recipes. I just wish they hadn't skimped so much on the pictures. The same is also true for their cupcake book.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is fun for all ages. My kids love it and so do I! We have fun working to unlock the games. Definitely worth downloading if you like mini games or if you just have kids who want something new to try.

I viewed my Pdf using kindlefire and then this app. This app has a better scroll feature, and when turning horizontally works better than the kindle fire. There is also a search option not on the kindlefire. Admittedly I'd like to zoom in on the text and scroll without it moving but neither kindle fire nor this app resolve that problem. Adobe provide some sort of lock feature allowing me to zoom in and scroll without the page moving and this app would be that much better.

B005PK1G76|5.0|great product! the velco really holds & doesnt fall off even while folding the stroller! im really happy with it
B005N0PJJO|3.0|Loved the first book.  This one was very cheesy.  I expected Christian's character to evolve more in this book; not so much.  I tired of the \\"inner goddess\\" references that made it sound like a teenager was the author.  It was more of a teengage romance novel than an erotic thriller.

0545265355|5.0|Purchased this for my niece for Christmas. The product came very quickly and saved me lots of money over a store even with shipping.
B004P98QZ8|3.0|My 10 year old son had to have this for Christmas. I was a bit dubious due to the cost but he went on about it for so long that we gave in. Anyway there are certainly a lot of pieces and it took him a few hours to build which was good. The trouble is that he hasn't played with it much since, but then that happens with most toys.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is fun, overall, but I can't help asking, why the heck do the pigs want the eggs so bad? I mean, yeah, eggs are edible, but (breaking flash news, Rovio!) pigs are PLANT-EATERS!!! And besides, even if they DID eat eggs, after the first time the birds kicked my butt, I'd give them their eggs back and never touch them again. I mean, if their smart enough to build forts, they could realize that. In conclusion, good game, bad storyline, don't buy paid version if either this or that.
B002RI90WM|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a book club and when I heard the title I thought I would never enjoy it being about racing. But I did. Being written in the first person by the dog it is just so different. Having a dog myself it really made me think about what goes through his head. It's certainly not exactly a happy book but it really takes you on a journey.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|I ordered this CD very close to Christmas, and really wasn't sure if it would arrive in time, to enjoy during the Holiday season.  But, the CD came really quickly, it was in perfect mint condition, the packaging was well insulated.  Over all, I was extremely pleased with ordering this CD, from the vendor that I chose.  I would give it a 5 starr rating.

0143039431|5.0|One of the greatest American books of all time.  It truly sits equal with Twain.  The praise of the government camps seems a little erky now, but just remember it's a symbol for government action.  The inner chapters have an almost Jazz like quality. So innovative.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I just purchased this cover (in pink) for my new Kindle Fire and I am very, very satisfied with it. It is very lightweight which is a good thing since the Fire is a tad on the heavy side. The MicroShell cover is very sturdy so I feel my Kindle is protected well and the pink flap is very soft and I have no worries of scratching. The flap folds back easily and holds the Kindle in position if I want it to stand. It closes with a wide rubber band piece and is very secure, secure enough that I can slip my wire earphones under the band to secure them and believe me, they do not move. This was a very good purchase. Oh, and as a sidebar, I received this so quickly, I was impressed.  Cyndy
0756404738|4.0|If Wise Man's Fear has a purpose, then it is a world-building novel. It sets the stage for the greater conflicts that are coming, exploring the different corners of Kvothe's world and explaining their traditions, cultures, and (most importantly) mythologies. It explains the creation of the Fae and its basic mechanics, and delves deeper into the workings of sympathy, sygaldry, naming, and so on. Granted none of this has much to do with the Chandrian (except that you learn their true names, get a complete description of their signs, gain some insight into how they try to keep themselves hidden from the Amyr and others, learn how they were probably able to track down and kill Kvothe's troupe in book 1, that the Masters at the University have knowledge of them, and that the Chandrian are both known and feared in the Fae), but that's beside the point.  This isn't Harry Potter (thankfully), so the answer to the ancient mystery isn't going to just be sitting around in some hidden room in the University that everyone already knew about but nobody ever bothered to search thoroughly so that Kvothe doesn't even have to cross the street to get the answers that he seeks. It's not that kind of story. If you just want to skip to the part where Kvothe sets off on his heroic quest to battle the Chandrian, knowing in advance nearly everything he must do and everywhere he must go, then this isn't the book for you.  Skip Wise Man's Fear and go straight to the next book.  On the other hand, if you are curious about Kvothe's world and the people (both real and magical) who reside within it, then this is the book to read.  All of the different people, places, and cultures are depicted artfully and in a way that is flush with detail but which also never feels like it is including anything extraneous.  And yes, there is certainly more sex and violence in this book than in its predecessor, but this should not be surprising to you if you've read The Name of the Wind. Kvothe is not ever held up as representing any kind of role model in either book. He is depicted as having a short temper with few qualms about resorting to violence from the beginning; he toys with the idea of killing Chronicler and crafts a careful plan to immolate a bully and his lackeys for crying out loud!  And you were given a summary of the entire story way back when, which goes:  \\"I have been called Kvothe the Bloodless, Kvothe the Arcane, and Kvothe Kingkiller. I have earned those names. Bought and paid for them.  I have, of course, been called many other things. Most of them uncouth, although very few were unearned.  I have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods, loved women, and written songs that make the minstrels weep.\\"  So yes, clearly he is not perfect nor perfectly altruistic. Clearly a lot of people dislike him, and for reasons that at least Kvothe sees as valid. Clearly he loses his virginity at some point, and is involved with at least two women plus Felurian. Clearly he kills at least one person (and probably more since kings are usually well-guarded).  These are things that happen. And they are things that were preceded by a warning about a thousand pages or so earlier.  If you have no stomach for sex and violence, then there was ample foreshadowing warning you to put down this book and read something else instead.  But if you've got an interest in Kvothe and his world and aren't offended by a level of sex and violence roughly appropriate for a story set in a medieval world full of swords and shields and bandits and warring feudal states, then this is the book for you.
0525478817|5.0|This book is not only for the young set. There is great benefit to all who read this. It's not only about two teens battling cancer; it's about a lesson to all of us to live our lives every day, every minute. We should be thankful for this time especially if we are lucky enough to find love and be capable of giving. This story is beautiful, funny, heartbreaking and poignant. Gus and Hazel made me laugh, cry, laugh all over again, and cry yet again. I'm still crying!

B0007KLH1Y|5.0|I got these for my grandson's ninth birthday. Although he has tons of lego & building experience,his parents report that he (w/ a friend sometimes) spends 3 hours at a time developing huge complicated projects using these little wooden planks. Very impressive, as well as creative, for such a simple toy.
B00006WKSZ|4.0|I like this album, its a harder edgier Scorpions than what I remember from the melodic tunes of the 80's.  It has a real raw and organic vibe to it.  This was different than what I expected and I enjoy the change from what I remember from this band in the 80's.  And I liked their 80's stuff as well.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|One of the things I don't like with most iPhone 4S cases is the fact that they are either ugly or so bulky that they make the phone look like an industrial wallet. I was very excited when I came across this product and watched the video review. Several things that appealed to me was the fact that it didn't appear to add much bulk; I love the fact that it's clear and the white of my phone can be seen; and it appeared easy to put on/remove. I am pleased to tell you that this product fulfills everything I wanted. If you're going to get a case for your phone, this should be it! My only complaint would be the clear screen protector. It makes sense to invest in a more expensive and better version. Getting the protector on was quite an ordeal as pieces of lint got caught in the stickiness and it was pretty much unusable at that point. Maybe the screen protector was included as an afterthought, but it definitely shouldn't be the reason why you purchase this product.
B000V6583C|5.0|This album had such a unique rock sound that held up and turned into a true rock classic.  Holds up today with its catchy line up.  Awesome bridges and classic guitar solos.
1405255439|5.0|I got the book after hearing about it on Charlie Rose PBS show with the author.  Was done as broadway play and they were discussing that so ordered book.  Now has been made into movie, I am waiting for my copy to arrive.  I also have the cd soundtrack from movie.  Will be interesting if movie follows book.  Was originally a children's book and is nicely done.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|The movie, In time, is Definitely a great idea, but with a lot of flows. It would take a lot more film and pages, to make this idea work. I actually wanted the lead actor to be the guy, who gave his time , and died in the beginning of the movie. Justin Timberlake was okay, but there is room for improvement, plus I am not his fan, even thought the movies that he played in, usually are really interesting.    Amanda Seyfried never fails to impress me. I thinks she is beautiful, and looks great as a brunet. Love watching her movies.    I liked '' In Time'' mostly because it made me think, just like anyone. Maybe someone can make a better movie, using this idea, and work on the flaws.    Common phrases were in abundance,with the word time.    It was so funny, but I just can't understand how they lived forever, if they had a lot of time, or how did they stay young for a long period of time. How did they frizz the age,  was  confusing to me. It was hilarious when Justin was being introduced, by Amandas father to the family, it was like watching 3 women the same age different generation, and I think Gemma Word who was the grandmother, was younger then her granddaughter. I gave this movie a B-.

0439023513|1.0|I thought Hunger Games was good. I thought Catching Fire was repetitive and pointless. I thought Mockingjay was a disgrace. The fact that this series is receiving so much acclaim is really an indication that the people of this world are as superficial as the literary Capitolians in these novels and can be entertained by poorly written, scattered story lines full of violence and nonsense. Honestly, I think Collins was a Team Jacob fan from the Twilight series and published these books to bring justice to Jacob by having Katniss end up with Peeta (spoiler alert, sorry). If you've read the two series, think about the parallels... supernatural beings (vampires and muttations), all powerful controlling body (Volturi and the Capitol), gory war violence, a normal girl torn between two men she loves while trying to protect her family from the reality of the situation, two attractive men trying to protect the one girl they love while she resists the idea of marriage and children, etc. etc. Overall, Mockingjay lacks character development, lacks a consistent story line, lacks dimension. You lose interest in the protagonists and the antagonists, and you're left feeling sorry for the few people in the plot who were genuinely happy with their lives because they die violently for really no reason. It's such a jumbled mess that the ending is actually perfect and expected considering how nonsensical the rest of the book is. Also, Collins needs some work in learning to illustrate scenes and people with detail... use more appeal to the senses and the imagination instead of being so technical and boring. Another thing that kills me is every time she doesn't know how to describe an event, she just conveniently has Katniss black out for a while. I guess that's a perk of being the author, but it sucks to be the reader. Don't waste your time getting involved in this series because they get progressively worse.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this. is a very very very very very very very very very vex very very very very verb good book.
0439023491|2.0|Literally, this story is the same as the Hunger Games only in a different arena.  There is very little character development, the writing is actually much worse, and the story line is predictable and boring.  I finished it because I bought it just to see what all the hype was about.  My advice to you... if you just want something to read to kill time, wait for this to come to the library.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I started the book and saw that it developed slowly as every small detail was there to be understood and remembered. A story is the sum of many parts. A great story is made up of vivid characters and their nuances. It is not to be delivered as \\"fast food\\" but to be savored slowly like a good meal topped off with desert, coffee and finally a fine brandy. Storytelling is applied magic that requires the attention and the presence of mind of the listener or the reader. It is interactive.

B004UXUUDA|4.0|Excellent Franco-American co-production set between the beginning of WW2 and the present, as American Journalist, working on a story about the Nazzi occupation of France, discovers a connection as she inhabits an apartment in Paris which holds the \\"key\\" to her story. Presented in 1.85:1 aspect ratio, with subtitles during the French dialog scenes, this is a well directed and effectively photogaphed thrilling drama. Excellent performance by a great cast which includes Kristin Scott Thomas in the leading role, ad supporing cast includes Aidan Quinn. I recommend this film highly.

B006ISJQ1W|2.0|A reporter, ideally, is supposed to seek out and expose the truth. If you can't find the truth or your superiors don't it want it published, make it up. At least that's the preferred method undertaken at The San Juan Star in this bizarre comedy based on the novel of same name.<br /><br />  Paul Kemp (played in typically off-the-wall fashion by Johnny Depp) is a novelist whose greatest work of fiction was the resume which got him a job at the Puerto Rico periodical. Determined to show the real living conditions outside the beach houses and five-star resorts, Kemp (Depp) experiences and recounts tales of dive bars, cock fights, and poverty among the local population. It becomes clear to him that his employers were looking for something they can print in a brochure, as opposed to the facts. While trying to satisfy his employers, Kemp encounters a local businessman by the name of Sanderson (played by Aaron Eckhart) after a chance encounter with his much younger fianc&eacute;e Chenault (played by Amber Heard). Sanderson has a proposition for Kemp and Chenault proves herself to be intriguing, unsatisfied, and just out of Kemp's reach.<br /><br />  While the accent's gone and the surroundings are meant to be gritty rather than supernatural, Paul Kemp is played here as though he's Jack Sparrow in a suit and tie for most of the film. He's perpetually inebriated and skates from one `dangerous' situation to the next without as much as a scratch. And while the later portions of the film seem to build toward some dramatic confrontation, what Kemp and the viewers are left with is disappointment.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|Let me begin by saying that I think Meryl Streep is perhaps the most talented actress to EVER appear in films.  It is no coincidence that she has been nominated for Academy Awards and Golden Globes more often than any other person.<br /><br />That being said, \\"The Iron Lady\\" is neither a \\"crown jewel\\" nor a \\"feather in her cap.\\"<br /><br />There must have been a powerful draw to portray Dame Margaret Thatcher, the first (and so far, only) female Prime Minister of Great Britain. But when I think of recent \\"real-life\\" biopics like \\"[[ASIN:B001NMYZXM Ray]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B003UESJH4 The King's Speech]]\\" (or even \\"[[ASIN:B002VXGW2E Julie & Julia]]\\", which featured Streep as famed Chef Julia Child), \\"The Iron Lady\\" falls short.  Far short.<br /><br />The film is anchored in a recent time - with Mrs. Thatcher an old widow, at least a little demented and frequented by hallucinations of her dead husband, played by Jim Broadbent in maybe the film's best performance.  The rest of the film is told in clumsy flashbacks, but always returns to doddering old Maggie - Ms. Streep under an often distractingly bad pile of makeup.  Old Margaret shuffles around the house, looks confused, stares out the window, and absolutely sucks any life from the narrative.  (Here the fault lies not with Ms. Streep, but with the screenplay and direction.  And perhaps editor.  Was there no one putting the final product together who looked at \\"the forest\\" and noticed \\"hey... we've got about half of the running time devoted to old Margaret shuffling around, getting in and out of bed, etc.?\\")<br /><br />In REALLY brief don't-blink-or-you'll-miss-them flashbacks we see the Margaret who grows up the daughter of a grocer with a political bent, marries a young earnest man who sees that Margaret is determined to become the powerful half of a couple, has twins, runs for office, and is finally thrust forward as Leader of the Conservative Party and elected Prime Minister.<br /><br />In a good biopic (like last year's King's Speech) you get a good feel for not only the central figure, but also those surrounding.  In \\"The Iron Lady\\" I never felt any connection to anyone.  Other players, such as daughters, other members of Parliament or American Secretaries of State, show up long enough to be cast aside by the ambitious \\"Iron Lady\\".<br /><br />How I wish that this film had reached the scope of \\"[[ASIN:B00190N4E4 Gandhi]]\\" or the emotional depth of \\"[[ASIN:B004SIP98S The Queen]].\\" The Mrs. and I agreed that it is likely that both Ms. Streep and Dame Thatcher herself are not pleased with the result.  We know we weren't - and it isn't OUR movie.<br /><br />Addendum: Last Sunday Meryl Streep and her make-up team both won Academy Awards for this film.  Neither of these facts change my opinion.  I read a post-Oscar article that suggested that the Make-up Award was given BECAUSE of Streep's performance.  Perhaps, but that being said, the Mrs. and I saw \\"J.Edgar\\" since I wrote my original review here - and the \\"old age makeup\\" for Leonardo DiCaprio was substantially more believable than what we saw in \\"The Iron Lady.\\"  Again - my major beef for this film is not at all related to Ms. Streep's performance or to the makeup, but rather to the overall movie and the amount of time it devoted to depicting a very old and very demented Margaret Thatcher.  Because of the award, someone unfamiliar with Street's total body of work could be tempted to think this performance and film superior to The Deer Hunter, Out of Africa, Bridges of Madison County, Doubt, etc.  IMHO - this would be incorrect.King's Speech) you get a good feel for not only the central figure, but also those surrounding.

B003QCCS36|5.0|I was skeptical about a new Ray Lamontagne cd with a full accompaniment backing him.  I have liked all three of his previous albums, each being better than the last.  After the first listen of this new album, I was not amazed by any means, but I did like it.  I listened a second time, and started pulling out a couple of i-pod worthy songs.  By the third play through, I could hear the album for what it was, which was simply the best music that Ray Lamontagne has done to date.  He really outdid himself on this album, and it really is astonishing how far he has come since Trouble came out.  Don't be skeptical of this album as I was, just pick it up, it's truly charming.

B001ECQ75A|5.0|This is an animated Dreamworks action comedy, that has Jack Black as the main character. The story is really fun and all the characters are interesting. I'll admit, there are odd voice acting choices, considering a lot of characters don't really talk much. That's not saying it hinders the movie. The animators do a great job of bringing the characters to life, as believable as they can be...considering they're all animals. This was the best Dreamworks movie in a couple years. The sequel is also fun.
0439023491|3.0|Great to be back in District 12 to see how the victors of the Hunger Games are doing. President Snow, briefly introduced at the end of the first book, quickly emerges as a ruthless villain. A new uprising is brewing and Katniss is flip-flopping her affections between Peeta and Gale. Then somewhere in the middle of the book the momentum is lost. While the first book opened on Reaping Day and never gave the heroine (or the reader) a chance to catch her breath, this journey has several time passages where she seems to have plenty of time to plan her next move. Unfortunately, instead of building on events that have been set up rather effectively in the first half of the book, Katniss sort of gives up and lets the story put her back into the kind of exciting situations that were so thrilling in THG. The writing is still fast-paced and exciting. A sequence where Katniss is being chased by a cloud of poisonous fog was reminiscent of the heart-pounding tracker-jacker chase in the first book. But then the last few chapters slow down as the main characters devise plans and sit around and wait for the precise time to carry out those plans. What was frustrating to me was the author trying so hard to misdirect us by having the narrator repeatedly over-analyze everything in the final third of the book on the completely wrong path when it was obvious to me (from a blatant clue given very early on) what was really happening. It made Katniss seem [politically incorrect term for not-so-bright]. Still, I'm looking forward to the uprising in the next book that was only teased at, then artificially delayed, here.
B005Q78IPG|4.0|Innocent China girl, 23, settles in London to improve her English. Moves in with an ageing hippie. Tours Europe with a rail pass.  The female first-person narrator produces interesting comparisons between western and Chinese culture (relationships, family, husband-wife, privacy, food, expressions, money). It's mostly written in naïve, child-like wrong Asian English, getting slightly better only towards the end.  I found it a fluent, easy read even though I had my reservations: Some episodes seem to be fumbled by force into the story just to illustrate another east-west conflict (The Guardian: \\"There's too much tell and not enough show\\"); the narrator's partner is a rather unusual figure (a bisexual vegetarian); the narrator attends English classes throughout her fictionary diary, but tells very little about class and shows very little progress except towards the end; occasionally her wording sounds much too complicated for the naïve non-native speaker she pretends to be.  I got the impression, that the author - who moved from China to England at age 22 - put her own life into the book. This includes several one-night stands across Europe, which I didn't care for very much. The role of cinema is too strong (the author studied film). Anyway, it is a very interesting and entertaining book if you're interested in England, China and/or intercultural relationships.

Its nice to have a well practiced writer who has both studied and thought about this subject explain things in a way that can help me explain reality to many of my friends and family who just don't get it. Like a new friend to me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was a really fun game and I really liked it . I like games were you have to earn points from games to get more games
0307887898|5.0|This is a quick read that uses some case examples to make the point that it is better to get into the market with an imperfect product than to wait and dither for perfection, which rarely comes after all. Even an imperfect product gives valuable information. Since new products are inherently risky, because most fail, it is best to find out quickly, learn and try again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some of the games are both thoughtful and fun. keeps me entertained!!!! my daughter can even play som of the games
1612130283|5.0|I wasn't really sure about this book simply by reading the jacket however, there is no one word I can use to describe this book. I was 100% engaged after the first page.  Being introduced to Mr. Christian Gray was an tantalizing for me as it was described to be for the character Ana.  Captivating, intriguing, troubling, moving and sexy !! Kudos to E.L. James for this book.  I hope that the second book in this THRILLogy will be as consuming as the first.
B006W0QOF2|3.0|i have not as of yet seen this movie...but...before i do, i will get out my dvd of \\"the driver - 1978 - with ryan o'neal\\" and watch first.  i will make a comparison as to any differences in acting, directing, etc.  the 1978 version happens to be an excellent movie.  some might think this 2012 version is the original, but as always, it has been done before and should be, if not better, just as good.  will update this review later and rate accordingly.
1612130607|5.0|The evolution of Ana and Christian (as well as the other characters) in this book will leave a resounding effect on you. Fifty Shades Freed was a more than suitable name for this third installment in the trilogy as Christian is \\"Freed\\" from his tormented past and Ana is \\"Freed\\" from a potentially tormented future with him.  Tears rolled and fists slammed as I languidly flipped the virtual pages of my Kindle to continue the read.  Christian's esoteric life finally comes to light in front of Ana and his own family, all of whom truly love him but really knew so little about him and his \\"Fifty Shades\\".  I sat completely attentive to 'Freed' as if I were trying to unravel Christian's history and mystery myself, reveling in each chapter I read.  The Fifty Shades trilogy will make you blush, palpitate and leave you hanging on every word.  Again, kudos and two thumbs up...and only because I only have two to raise.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Pretty good, looks good and challenging, but not as good as the original. Nice that it doesn't have ads though,
1612130585|5.0|As a whole, I don't find that books subsequent books in a series, saga, trilogy etc. are as good as the first, but to say that about this book would be a complete untruth. Another book that couldn't be easily set down, I found myself up into the wee hours of the morning reading.  The \\"relationship\\" between Christian and Ana was obviously already in turmoil before it ever really started. The first book gives us just a small glimpse into Christians 'Fifty Shades' while Fifty Shades Darker is more revealing of the the rest. Can Christian be what Ana wants and consequently, as much as he wants her in his life, can Ana ever truly be all Christian needs ?  This book will leave you in a constant state of revery. Looking at every \\"Christian\\" you see leaving you to wonder if a person of such mystery, such beauty could truly exist. Thanks goodness there is a book 3 (Fifty Shades Freed) to give us more !  Congratulations again to the Author for such a wonderful piece of fantasy for us all to share.
B000654YS8|3.0|First of all I like music concerts or live recordings.  From this point I can say it´s not the best  Dire Straits DVD.  It has no unity,  it´s like several Videos placed  together on a DVD. Some of them are Recorded Live and some others are the videos I used to watch on MTV...  No subtitles!!  They are just for the main menu.
B000OPPBEQ|3.0|This looks extremely promising (BDs usually have better image quality for HDTV viewing) but what is in this collection? I see it mentions The Matrix multiple times... but what is the \\"Reloaded\\" version? There was only the one movie. Are these enhanced \\"What if?\\" versions or something?

0307593312|3.0|This is my review of 1Q84, thus far....I've only gotten to the end of 'book 1'......usually I find it hard to put down a Murakami story, but this time, as the plot constantly shifts between the story of Tengo and Aomame, I am alternately bored and fascinated.  While exploring the central mystery of a secretive cult, Murakami ends up repeating the same information.  It's also unusual that certain peripheral character are not given names but are referred to as \\"Tengo's older girlfriend\\" etc.  Hopefully part 2 will make up for the shortcomings of the story so far
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|It only took a few days for me to get the movie. It is in fact a blue ray and it comes with a digital copy.

B004L79VUI|2.0|Lyrically this is a big disapointment. On the bright side the music by itself is very good. All in all I can't stand listening to it due to the stupid lyrics.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this game! ! have it on my kindle fire!! would recommend it on the fire!! keeps me busy and gives me goals to get higher scores
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The Winchesters are my favorite brothers on TV and the last ep of this season is Swan Song, my favorite ep ever.  When I tell people that do not know SPN, I say it is about family. Yes a family that just happens to hunt demons, vampires and all the things that go bump in the night. My number one series and I have watched all seasons over and over. The writers have a good mix of scary, humor and great one liners.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game. I love this game. I wish the games were already unlocked. It would be so much better.
030726999X|5.0|This is the last book Stieg Larsson wrote. It is the third is a series which was planed to be a ten book series. However Stieg Larsson died of a heart attack, after climbing 7 flights of stairs to his office, because of an \\"out of order\\" elevator.  Of course it's a great book and will probably become a collectors item.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is so so good and I love it so very much great for passing time and I love it
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I already loved this movie for lots of reasons. Then my boyfriend got it for me for my birthday. Yay!!!  The story is of a young couple, well almost a couple, of teens along with the girl's huge family save the world from being attacked by the evil internet virus Love Machine.
0525478817|5.0|ive read all of john greens books, and im a huge fan, i love this book. its not your typical cancer book, if you know what i mean. the plot was different that what was expected, but i wont say and be a spoiler! its a beautiful book and i encourage you to read it. my copy was signed and its something ill treasure for a very long time, i wish all of my john green books were signed!

B004UID2LC|4.0|I'm on the kindle fire and this app crashes quote frequently on me, very annoying. other than that I LOVE this app, does what it says.
B006ZBRMOU|3.0|I really loved the series..I was very excited for the third book but in my opinion it felt short..I expected more from Jack Hyde..more action more drama and more steaming love scenes..I love ana and chistian their romance but for me lacked intensity like in the other books..that was HOT..not so much in this one...but i still love the series i will love the second book forever...
0525478817|5.0|This is a beautiful story. It made me happy, sad, angry. It made me laugh, cry, and long for a boy...in a book...that is only fiction. Oh, but how  Mr. John Green made the characters come to life and made you feel like you were in their world with them. If only for a little while.  So again I will say beautiful. This is a book worth reading. It is one of those stories that stays with you. Even after I finished the book and put it away, I am still thinking about it.

B00000JNNY|5.0|Etta James has died; and the world has lost a major talent and legend. She shall be sorely missed by this writer and countless others! I feel so sad, even shocked, although I read the news reports recently that she had little time left to live. She had her ups and downs in life; but here on this CD we get her first album for Chess Records and she is in wonderful form all throughout the album--this is the way I want to remember Etta best. The sound quality is excellent as well.<br /><br />Etta had it rough in many ways; she barely knew her mother and her father was absent from her childhood. However, she stood out from the start when she sang in church--but that wasn't enough for Etta; she wanted fame and she wasn't afraid to be \\"raunchy,\\" as she called it--but what I think she truly meant was that she wanted to sing meaningful ballads straight from the heart.<br /><br />This album has nothing but exquisite songs all performed by Etta. We get fine numbers like \\"Anything to Say You're Mine;\\" her excellent diction and sophisticated sense of timing and phrasing all combine to make this and other numbers here absolutely timeless. \\"My Dearest Darling\\" sounds terrific in Etta's more than capable hands; and there are other gems including \\"Trust in Me\\" with Etta handling tempo and key changes like the pro she always was; the poignant \\"A Sunday Kind of Love\\" with that music fitting in perfectly with Etta's vocals; \\"Tough Mary\\" with some backup even though Etta never needed backup--her talents carried her through every time; \\"I Just Want To Make Love To You\\" with Etta's usual exquisite touch; \\"At Last\\" which remained one of her best hits throughout her career; \\"All I Could Do Was Cry\\" which sounds fresh and new every time I hear Etta sing it; a stunning rendition of \\"Stormy Weather (Keeps Rainin' All The Time);\\" \\"Girl of My Dreams\\" that gets the royal treatment from Etta James; \\"My Heart Cries\\" with Etta squarely front and center; a great duet with then-boyfriend Harvey Fuqua  on \\"Spoonful;\\" \\"It's a Crying Shame\\" and the closing number, \\"\\"If I Can't Have You.\\"<br /><br />Etta James may be gone; but she clearly lives on through her music. She will remain a music legend forever and that's grand. Etta's fans should add this to their collections and it makes a fine starter CD for anyone just discovering the incredible artistry of the great Etta James.s a Crying Shame\\" and the closing number, \\"\\"If I Can't Have You.\\"  Etta James may be gone; but she clearly lives on through her music.

B004H83IM8|5.0|Some dummy gave this product a poor review because it supposedly didn't have all three movies. Well, the third movie is on the reverse side of disk two.  Dummy.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I first watched this movie several months ago. It's really quite sweet. It tells the story of a young man who has trouble acceptance. Who he really is versus what he's expected to be. If you're into stories that make you excited about the characters, I say this movie is for you. It's a decent length film and one that I think is pretty well written. Give it a chance. I bet you'll be pleasantly surprised!
B000KIRT6A|5.0|If you want an eq pedal right away to tweak guitar/keyboard sounds, this think is GREAT. People are trying to hate on this, but it is fine, I was expecting the worst from the reviews, but still wanted it so I got it anyway. You don't need the adapter they push (the behringer brand 9v), best way to work with this is turn all bands ALL THE WAY DOWN, then just go up with each one till you get the guitar sound you like, then you can turn it off during this test to go back to your \\"default/normal sound\\" to hear the difference. It works nicely, and for the price it was a steal. In the future I may get a more expensive one, this seems fine for now.
B0054JELS4|5.0|Bought these for my husband, who's biggest complaint is he always misses the continuations on TV.  Now he can pick the show, and see them all in order.  It was a great Christmas gift.

1451627289|5.0|I finished the last page of this book two days ago - roughly three days after I first picked it up. I simply could not finish reading and now that I'm done, I can't stop thinking about it.  I've never been a huge fan of Stephen King, although I have read some of his more famous works. Definitely a good writer, just not that much into the whole horror genre. I am, however, extremely interested in the JFK assassination and I love time travel books.  I read some reviews stating how boring this book is and how long it is and how much it's NOT about the Kennedy assassination. Look, King will happily describe a lamp post for six pages but that's just the way he writes. I don't think it was too long at all - matter of fact, I want more, more, more!  There's two story lines here, one of romance and one of stopping a major event in US history. Both are given equal room and are mixed together in some very intelligent ways. It's not a nail biter, but there are chapters that just keeps you hooked and you can't...stop...reading. I love it. 5/5.
B001P9EQH8|2.0|i purchased this to use with my 55 ohm headphones and was disappointed to learn that the battery on mine was completely dead and refused to except a charge. The amp functioned normally when plugged into a power source but this amp is suppose to be portable so its useless without battery power. Going to return and get a fiio E11 instead. This amp sounds great with very low interference for the price but FiiO's quality control is poor at best.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I was a little skeptical at first, but after a few weeks with this app, I can truly say its a must have for people who wish they could carry their home pc in their pocket. Works flawlessly on my galaxy s phone and connects fast! Can't wait to see what future updates bring to the table. Five stars!
B004YW4L5K|5.0|Have been reading since I was 4 years old and am now 61.  There are few books I keep a copy of and none (before this one) that I have purchased AFTER having read it.  But am buying this one and on top of that, am planning on reading it again (another thing I seldom do is reread a book).  So - granted, you don't know me from Adam - but believe me, my purchase of this book is beyond any review or rating I could ever give it.  It's just a dern tooting good book and if you like good fiction and enjoy stirring up the \\"little grey cells\\", then buy and read this book.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag works as advertised. It is made from high quality nylon and holds my Nikon D5100 and four lenses snug and comfortably. I highly recommend it.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Excellent product well made durable I do not know about the durability of the elastic stripe on the back. But I really like the product and how it fits and protects the kindle fire
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Let me start by saying that I think that many people on Amazon are way to cavalier about placing one star reviews. Reviews are meant as a service to each other to help give some perspective about a product. If you have a bone to pick, fine, but there's no way this should've been given a 1 star review. Everything about this movie was well done. The editing, camera work, etc. The acting is superb. This director did an amazing job because even the people in this movie who played very minor roles were so believable. It made for a very enjoyable experience. I read this book and for once the movie was way better. The book I found dry and repetitive. The movie kept me totally engaged. Brad Pitt is on the top of his game here.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great time waster. It is a little annoying that the points you need to unlock games keeps increasing, while you don't get very many points per game, but the games are fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game I love it so much with all of the great games in it, would so reccomend to a friend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful both from a technical and a practical standpoint. Very sleek and convenient. Love everything about it from the Bible interface to the devotions and daily reading plans. We have it in all our devices and I always recommend it to friends and family.<br /><br />This app is a true blessing!!!!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I am a romance reader and this book (and the first two) has truly hit the mark. These books are the real thing. The ups and downs of the real world and the effects that life have on a couple are truly shown throughout the series. Nothing is predictable, it had me on the edge of my seat throughout not knowing what was coming or where it would end. While many romance stories hit a point where the ending is predictable (a happily ever after where the simple differences are resolved) and the final scene is a forgiving kiss; E L James goes beyond the norm and pulls you in to a true to life complicated existence that REAL people face. Granted were probably not all secretly hiding a BDSM lifestyle or an extremely overbearing millionaire boyfriend that could buy a country should he chose. But life isn't all roses and James shows that in an enticing and enthralling journey between two seemingly opposite people. An extraordinarily well done job. I recommend this book to all REAL life romance readers who are looking to be captivated in the first chapter. Thank you E L James, you do not know how much I have truly enjoyed your talents. You are wonderful.
B001IFZL50|3.0|Having read the book then immediately rereading I was really looking forward to seeing the miniseries. I did notice significant differences between the two but have no idea as to which was closer to reality since my own military experience was nothing close to this. We had disparaging nicknames for all of our officers however since I was in crypto-maintanance they at least admitted that they had nothing of value to say to me other then muttering \\"ETR\\" periodically.  My only problem was with the Blu-Ray Disc itself.  It's seven hours long but if you stop it for any length of time you have to start over from the start along with interminable ads and warnings in half a dozen languages.  They couldn't give us \\"RESUME WHERE STOPPED\\" like in any DVD?  I think that the formatting of the disc seriously detracted from one of the best war movies I have seen in years.
0385504225|3.0|I can't add anything to the 2000+ reviews already done, except to say that 3 stars (\\"OK\\") is a fair rating. Not nearly up to the quality of The Da Vinci Code, nevertheless, worth the read. But quite glad I read this from an ebook I checked out of my library, and didn't pay anything for. Might be worth $1.
B005YDLJ76|1.0|I am one of the biggest Beyonce fans for sure! However this was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY! It's basically the Vegas intimate concert DVD with 4-5 new songs from the 4 album. No wardrobe changes or anything like that. Same skit, going through the MJ song, Destivy Childs etc etc. If you have the Vegas one (which I would def buy over this one if you don't have it) I would not buy this. Save your $! I read other reviews saying the same thing and thought they were just haters but they weren't! They were right. Def waste of money! I would even send it back but between the cost of shipping to and from it's not worth it to even send it back.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|I bought this little tape player because I have a bunch of old cassette tapes I wanted to transfer to cd's,Lot of the reviews said it was hard to install the software and what not, I'm not a rocket surgeon,but I got it put on my laptop and desktop in about 20 minutes, READ the instructions! Which by the way are printed pretty small but readable. Its a Little bit slow transferring data, and a little bit of a learning curve to figure out which way to put the tape in so side one plays first etc. Play with this little gem and you can do it too. Only thing I did notice was it sounded like some of my tapes were skipping like old vinyl LP's used to, sort of cutting out for just a word or so.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Not fancy, just simple &amp; perfect. Have this on multiple devices and love it. If you like plain old solitaire, you won't do better than this.

B003YOMNCM|3.0|Both violin concerts are a beautiful interpretation. The first one is very soft and goes with intensity. It is a modern form of the classical repertoire. It has wild interruptions with the wind section. She plays it very good. The Higdon concert had a very easy access then the Schoenberg violin concert. Higdon dedicated it for Hilary Hahn. The violin part is characterised through a brilliant playing. It is not so modern as so many new modern concerts are.  The violin concert of Tchaikovsky is so often on CD that you can chose from a very wide variety. I prefer the edition by Baiba Skride. There you have a complete album of Tchaikovsky interpretations. (Swan Lake, Glasunov) Hilary Hahn plays it on a very high level but you have no special edition of the concert. If you have a good edition of the Tchaikovsky concert than it gives you no benefit. If you like the Higdon concert more than the Tchaikovsky one, than the CD is a complete bull's eye.
1401223176|5.0|This is an awesome graphic novel.  Seriously, every major batman villian makes a cameo in this thing.  Great story, twist after twist.  I am a casual Batman fan at best, so I wasn't up on all the different Robins and whatnot, but the story made it very easy to follow and doesn't punish you for not being a fanboy.
B004FOA84A|5.0|played with my 5 and 6 year old boys.  we all loved the sound effects, graphics and the challenge.  worked perfectly on my fire.  now i need to find another game just like this one to play with the boys.
0786955570|5.0|Good game.  Don't be afraid of all the pieces, it's not that bad.  The rules could be a little clearer in places, but there's lots of unofficial erratta on the interweb that addresses them.  The box art is kinda weak, but it's what's on the inside that counts.
0439023483|1.0|My daughter loves these books and begged me to read them so we could talk about them.  I truly wish she had never read them in the first place!  Yes, the other reviewers are correct, the books are bloody and barbaric and wholly inappropriate.  But the main problem is that this is a poorly written rehashing of a million other stories, some of them not very good in the first place.  **SPOILERS**  Katniss is a worse heroine than Bella Swan, entirely unlikable and irritating as a narrator.  The love triangle is not set up properly, Gale is a completely static character throughout the first and second books, leaving the reader to wonder why on earth she would consider him over Peeta.  Peeta is unbelievable as a character because his devotion to Katniss is so sorely misplaced.  Collins' idea is compelling at first, but ultimately goes nowhere.  With no growth or maturity on the part of the narrator the reader's view of this alien world is stunted and shallow.  She mistrusts and thinks poorly of everyone else, so naturally we come to not believe her instincts as they are proven wrong time and time again, thus rendering plot twists mundane and expected.  The conclusion is the lowest blow of all.  It is perhaps the worst ending since, \\"and then I woke up\\".  This is, unfortunately, a recurring theme throughout the books; Katniss is rendered unconscious for hours or days and afterward is told of the important and world changing events that happened while she was sleeping or hiding or drugged.  Go find something else worthy of reading-Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, Brandon Sanderson, Anne McCaffrey, Ray Bradbury.  Even James Patterson is better than this!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|It's been quite a while since I've picked up a S.K. book........but I soon found myself blasting through the pages so that I could find out what was going to happen. If nothing else, I'll be going back to start my \\"rediscovery\\" of Mr. King's work.
B005EVV5GI|5.0|I have all four of these Mahler symphony recordings on separate CD's from previous reissues.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game! It needs focus, though. The little Om Nom guy is adorable! Especially when you break or drop the candy and his eyes get all glossy. You can change the candy to a donut and a cupcake. People need to get over themselves when it comes to updates. Just chill out and wait! What is this game, your life? Freaks. That is coming from a girl who's best friend is a total whack job.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Damn those fast missles!!! this game is very addicting &amp; so much fun. the only gripe I have is that it won't let you upgrade past level 5 ... otherwise ... basic, simple, no big graphics but AWESOME GAME!!!!
B00275EHJG|5.0|I had never seen any of the Toy Story movies when I was asked to go to this one.  The kids were really young in that movie theatre but they barely made a movie and were quiet all the way through.  So was I!  Toy Story 3 was far better than most movies in 2010 and I suspect the best one.  Woody, Buzz and the friends are left in a toy chest now and with Andy going to college, mom is all gung ho in cleaning out his room before he goes.  The toys have to be carted up to the attic or thrown out.  That's it.  Andy puts the toys in a garbage bag and leaves it to go up into the attic but mom thinks they are meant for the junkyard and puts them out for the trash!  The toys manage to get themselves to a daycare center but it turns out to be a living hell.  A stuffed bear named Lots-O rules the roost with cruelty and the toys need to get out before they are broken by unruly young children.  Woody has been chosen to go to college with Andy but tries to save his friends.  Adventure ensues.  What is so impressive is how complex the story is and how well developed the movie is made.  Adult movies are usually more childish these days and contain less complex dialog.  Toy Story 3 doesn't insult children or adults and entertains all.  This movie is truly for all ages and meant for enjoyment of all.  Wonderful film.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was very pleased with this app. The games keep you interested and very creative. I would recommend this app to anyone.

0393327345|4.0|I'll admit that I'm one of those who watched the movie various times before actually picking up the book. That being said, I will also say that I am a Palahniuk fanatic. I have fallen in love with the movie, so it shouldn't have been that hard to love the book, right? Eh, that's where things get difficult. For me, the book wasn't that hard of a read. This was the third Palahniuk book I've picked up, so I've come used to his style. (However, I did have to reread a few things every now and again.) I do like the book; I will reread it as many times as I'll please if I ever so get the desire, but it's still a bit on the edge about it.<br /><br />The movie does change a variety of aspects of the novel. And I can't quite tell if I prefer the book or the movie more. I guess, for now, I'll just say that I love them both despite the differences. But I'll probably be enjoying the movie before I pick up this book again.

145162445X|4.0|Cosmologist and theoretical physicist, Lawrence Krauss tells us that science has unveiled the astounding concept that nothingness is not necessarily metaphysical, but that it is just as physical as \\"something,\\" and that nothingness is unstable. \\"Nothinginess\\" being defined as not even empty space, or time. The implication being that quantum physics is showing it to be plausible that indeed something can arise out of nothing without the need for divine guidance, where science does not make it impossible to believe in God, but rather makes possible to not believe in God. Enter the strong possibility that ours is a universe that is just one among trillions, known as the multiverse, and it changes the playing field when we think about creation.<br /><br />He points out that we cannot consistently and simply pass the buck and invoke God every time we are confronted with a perplexing question just to avoid asking \\"how,\\" and allow it to die there. That it is not intellectually dynamic nor honest, and that, \\"even theologians recognize that such recourse diminishes the grandeur of their supreme being,\\" especially when new work is casually dismissed when it explains the puzzle.<br /><br />Krauss offers some mind bending insights, however, there are swaths in this book that were over my head, finding them incomprehensible, laborious and boring, and I suspect most lay people will have the same experience. Despite that, Krauss gives the reader a sense of the enormous complexity involved in the truly ingenious processes scientists create in answering these stupendous mysteries, a new perspective on the nature of our existence, and nature itself. He states, \\"A truly open mind means forcing our imaginations to conform to the evidence of reality, and not vice versa, whether or not we like the implications.\\"<br /><br />Joe Arrigo<br />Author of, Fostering Cooperation: Power and Harmony through People<br />and, The Secret Factor for Uncommon Sales Success

B002436WFI|5.0|This is a fun movie that takes some liberties with the original source but keeps the humor (or should I say humour?) of the books.  The effects are on par or better than what one expects in made for TV broadcast films.  all in all this is a fun film.  Everyone in my house from my 1st grade daughter to her somewhat adult-acting parents love it!  I bought this as a gift for a friend after he discovered The Hogfather and found it to be quite enjoyable.
B0000696I1|1.0|This is seriously the \\"Manos: The Hands Of Fate\\" of the TMNT franchise.<br /><br />I recently got a bit...well, I'll just say too curious and started watching on YouTube. I knew this was bad already because I watched a trailer for it once and noticed the costumes weren't made by Jim Henson's Creature Shop for this one. The animatronics in the original costumes were way better and allowed for a far better range of facial expressions, but in this one I don't know what the heck they did.<br /><br />Either they sped up the film to make the voice-overs match the mouths, or the mouths were just flapping back and forth erratically (usually not matching the words. They were more careful about that in the first 2 movies). In some scenes, it's really hard to tell, though neither would surprise me because this movie is that bad.<br /><br />Whoever did the puppetry for Splinter was terrible. The first time he opens his mouth, the delay between the voice and movements is painfully obvious. Also, the voice was not the original man who played him.<br /><br />Lastly of course is the script. There are no real villains that present a challenge, no Shredder of course but come on, there were so many other awesome villains from the comics and cartoons they could have used. April just so happened to pick up an old Japanese scepter at a flea market and the turtles are sent back in time to feudal Japan, exchanging places with four guys whom Splinter and Casey Jones are left to babysit for the duration of the entire film.<br /><br />The characterization was so completely off that it made me want to cry. Raphael isn't angry or upset as usual, Splinter isn't as mellow or sagely, Casey Jones doesn't even do anything...<br /><br />It's just such a departure from what TMNT originally was. The first film was spot-on PERFECT. It had all the darkness of the comics, a few funny moments, serious moments, and it knew exactly when each needed to be expressed. The music was great as well, and the camraderie and life lessons were all there. The second wasn't as good, but was still tolerable and fun.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and don't touch this one. I regret spending even 2 seconds on it.ood, but was still tolerable and fun.  Do yourself a favor and don't touch this one. I regret spending even 2 seconds on it.
B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game is a good time killer.  Works just fine on my old Droid 1.  I like the ability to upgrade the defenses upon successfully defending the city and that the difficulty doe increase pretty well to match your upgrades.

0439023491|4.0|I loved this book! Catching Fire is my favorite book in the whole series. People are rebeling in the districts, and they're using Katniss as thier banner. President Snow tells her to make the rebels believe that her stunt with the berries was an act of love, not rebelion. Katniss tries to do this,but fails, and the rebels continue to fight in her name. Then comes the Quarter Quell. A Quarter Quell happens every 25 years, and the Hunger Game has a twist to it. In the first one, The people had to vote on who goes. In the second, there were twice as many children. Now, in the third, the unlucky contestents are victors from previous games. With that, Katniss and Peta are thrown back into the arena. They make an uneasy alience with Finick; a sexy man from district 4, an older woman; also from district 4, \\"Nuts and Bolts\\"; two crazies from district 2, and Jona; a woman from district 5. Together they figure out the traps of the arena, but there is somthing wrong with it all. The other victors are protecting Katniss and Peta, some even sacrificing themselves for them. Is this just another game, or is someone keeping them alive for a purpous? If you like suspence, action, and mystery, then this is a good book for you. I only gave the book 4 stars however, because of some unnecessary nudity and other \\"R-rated\\" scenes, but it is still a fast read and an awesome book.

0553382179|5.0|I found this at a used book sale at the library. I try to keep my house clean enough, but it seems like I am always behind and there is always clutter. I enjoyed reading this book, because it helped me realize that I am not the only person who has this issue. Flylady helped me to realize that some of us just need a little extra help in the area of the keeping the home clean, while for others it just comes naturally.For those who have a hard time keeping the house clean, this is a great start. I love her philosophy on clutter and &#34;blessing&#34; the home.  It has now been a few years since I first read this book. This is the book that started me on a journey to finally having a clean house. I have read other cleaning books since then, including Sidetracked Home Executives and have incorporated some of those ideas into my routine. As you learn new routines and how to keep a clean house, you will naturally start to find what works for you. I will always be grateful that I found this book by chance one day at the library, because it changed my life.come up with our own routines anyway. I would definitely recommend the book over the email group if you are interested.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I bought this watch for my husband for Christmas and he was excited to use it. He used it a few times and thought it was great, but when he went to use it for the Disney half marathon it wasn't so great anymore. He is having a real hard time with the touch bezel. He wants to return it and get one without the touch bezel. Other than that he says it's great. It would be a 5 star if it wasn't for the sensitive touch bezel.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I don't think anyone can say enough about this series of shows.  The actors are incredible and do a wonderful job of embracing their roles.  It was so easy to get involved with each character, and get heartbroken when they disappeared in a hail of bullets and mortar.  The generation of WWII vets are disappearing fast, and most great grandchildren will never know what their grandparents saw and did in the war. This series gives a great insight to the struggles and mental hardships of the men. As a grandchild of a WWII vet I can tell you I never heard my grandfather's story.  It was something he just didn't talk about.  When I would ask him what he did over there, he would only tell me he built bridges in Europe.  After seeing and hearing the stories of these soldiers I began to understand why he never spoke about it.  I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in our military and their history during WWII.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|There is no option to repeat the audio notification.  If you miss it the first time you're screwed.  For some reason it is causing my battery to drain quickly and wake locks
B006Y5EMHM|5.0|I really enjoyed this episode! The songs were great - and the two lead actresses both had amazing voices. All the characters were well acted, scripted and directed. I can't wait to see the rest of the episodes!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love angry birds and always will no matter how old I am I will love it when I'm 68 hears old
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I picked up the first book and loved it.  The second book was okay...but didn't have a purpose beyond expanding the story...then we got into books three to five.  Great stories...but no reason for them...new characters coming out of the wood work and not advancing the plot.  This last book was hopelessly the worse one yet...nothing happened and the characters never got beyond doing stuff...To be honest George R.R. Martin is a great writer and should stick to short stories, or he needs to go back to writing 101 and learn to develop a novel...or just go back to book one...he did so much better there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for kids and it is a great time killer. my son n loves these action games. my 3 year old likes the frog game
B004P2HMNM|5.0|What can I say! Of course this is a stupendous product. My son still builds these, (and shhhh he is thirty and works a very stressful corporate job). He has many of the city sets and duplicates of several. These fill his need to create , relax and I think re-live a bit of childhood in a sea of work days and responsibilities. They are so well thought out in design and have  such amazing tiny details . He loves lego, I love that he does, and I will continue to buy this great product for him. I hope more come out in this particular series. The detailed buildings such as these are by far his favorites. Ah yes..as far as educational..please, it is one of the few toys left that allow you to build as it was designed, and then as we do ...take them apart and re-design with your own ideas.
1451627289|3.0|I've read Stephen King in the past and his books scared the heck out of me. Good suspenseful reading. I bought 11/22/63 expecting a lot from Mr. King and was disappointed. Great premise, decent characters but it was too wordy and just a mediocre read. The middle was too long and the ending wrapped up too quick. Good book for jury duty.
1932735410|4.0|I think this book is very much helpful and it is very easy to follow the book so that I can emphasis on my study.I found many websites for pm exam like Chris Scordo's pmperfect.com etc. although those websites contents are not bad and as well as full of information but those were little difficult to me to understand the contents. The contents of this can be easily understand and if any one ask for any suggestion to me then I will happy to recommend this book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! Great selection of reading plans to choose from; community encouragement; many, many translations to use in your study of the Word.

0345529057|5.0|Such a wonderful collection, I have been so enthralled. The story lines are so original, I have enjoyed every minute reading each book.
B006YNC4LA|5.0|This was another great episode, but dont expect any resolution. A young woman is strangled to death and all signs point to the Mayor having committed the crime. The investigation shows she had been a college professor, but quit suddenly and began taking odd jobs prior to her death. Why? Well, i wont tell ya', but the why was a cool twist of sorts. However, the main theme of this episode centers on Beckett's investigation into her mother's death. You may recall Castle was encouraged to steer her away from investigating that murder, and she ended up taking a sniper's bullet because of her persistence. Well, it seems we will be delving further into those mysteries as the season progresses. Sadly, the young lady's strangulation is loosely tied to Beckett's mothers death, so of course, the real killer is never revealed. However, it is a tantalizing thread to keep us wanting more in this particular, overarching plot line.<br /><br />Enjoy!

B005OK722U|1.0|Some Producer didnt get his coke on time and as a result his naggy wanabie filmmaker son was given the chance to make a sequel to any film he wanted to. So he thought and thought \\"hmmmm.. horror thats easy a little blood everyone is happy i can do that\\", well no he cant. This dumb boring film if only will end the tourcher porn thing and people will go back to makeing good films, please Saw is done...i hope Hostle ??? are you done,. Human Centapied 2 was a joke so i hope thats done. If anyting the single thing good that could come out of this mess of a film will be the end to ely roth and Tourcher porn NONE ARE SCARY THERE JUST DUMB, LIKE MR ROTH WHO COULDNT DIRECT HIS WAY OUT OF A BAG.
B004LROUW2|1.0|This book should have been half as long and still would have been overdone.  And the ending?  It's brainless and makes me sorry I kept on reading.  What happened to the Sakigake gang anyway?  I read a lot and cannot figure out what everyone likes about this book.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|Utter & total garbage! I suffered 15 minutes of this rubbish before switching my dvd player off in disgust. Pathetic script,pacing, direction & acting, that says it all. This is the pits in a nutshell & the worst thing is knowing that there were enough people who watched this to warrant sequels,go figure!
B0061HZWTU|5.0|This movie is my favourite Aussie movie, bar none! I am from Australia too, and I first saw it there, and had to have my own copy. It is a love story, but also very funny, and the dancing is amazing.  If you like Romantic dancing movies, you will love this one too.

0679446230|5.0|His prose is almost poetry, it is so concise without feeling so. I am definitely going to read more of his books now.
0439023521|4.0|A friend told me about this book and then I watched the movie trailer and looked at the casting for the movie on IMDB. This way I get a picture of each character before reading the story. I have to say, based on what I read, they really nailed the actors for each part. Woody Harrelson is a perfect Haymitch and Lenny Kravitz should be great.<br /><br />I'm a little old to be reading teen fiction but I really enjoyed this book. The characters are very interesting and the author spends a lot of time giving back stories. I was entertained from start to finish. Some parts more than others but it was all very good.<br /><br />I wouldn't give the entire series four stars as the quality of the story starts to take a nosedive about halfway through the second book.<br /><br />I suspect the movie coming out in March will be even better than the book.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I did like the book, but I can't believe that an author of Baldacci's caliber would borrow the Jack Reacher character from Lee Child. It is just another Jack Reacher book with a few small changes. Baldacci has made it official: he has run out of creative talent and is now borrowing others Ideas. SAD!

B0036S4C6G|5.0|Let's be honest: the Pulitzer is the cool prize to win in literature. With a Nobel winner you run the risk of a book that you don't understand, either because it's too deep or because it's not in English. When you pick up a book that's won a Pulitzer, you can (almost) never go wrong. Some of my favorite books, like The Road, Beloved, and A Confederacy of Dunces have won the prize. The 2011 winner isn't like any of those fine works, and that's why it's so brilliant.<br /><br />Some people hysterically (as in upset, not as in funny) wanted to classify this book as a collection of short stories with some characters in common. I preferred to think of the book as a chain. Each chapter seemed to introduce a new character (the cast was enormous!), to which the following chapter would be devoted - but not necessarily in their current form. Perhaps they are much younger. Maybe they are much older.<br /><br />For example, if there is a main character it is the kleptomaniac Sasha, an assistant to a record producer. When we first meet her she is in her mid-30's. A few chapters later we encounter her in college, then in her teens. She finally appears in the dystopian final section of the book as a middle-aged mother of two teenagers. The other characters appear in a similar, non-linear fashion. Nevertheless, just because the presentation is non-linear does not mean that (if you were so anal-retentive) you couldn't outline the events. There is a plot there. It just refuses to follow the prescribed formula, which is the definition of creativity.<br /><br />There have been other non-linear works in the past (think Pulp Fiction), but that is not the only source of novelty for Goon Squad. Narrative modes change from chapter to chapter, including the rare second-person perspective. I don't think I've ever read anything in second person except for a Choose Your Own Adventure book. Formats change, including the chapter presented as a young girl's journal made up entirely of PowerPoint slides. Why the girl chose PowerPoint as her journaling medium isn't quite explained, but few people can explain why girls do anything. Whatever the case, that idea was so damn cool I wanted to throw my Kindle through the window, frustrated that I hadn't come up with it first. Finally, the last few chapters offer a Children of Men-like view of our possible future, commenting on everything from our recent militarism to climate change to the impact of technology on our youth.<br /><br />When I finished Goon Squad, I was sad. Sad that it was over, yes, but also sad that I will probably never write a book this brilliantly conceived. But that doesn't mean I'm going to stop aiming for it.rPoint as her journaling medium isn't quite explained, but few people can explain why girls do anything.

B004132HZS|5.0|This series is incredible.  There's action, deduction, and one of the best friendships ever.  The details relating back to the original stories are beautifully done... Cinematography and writing are superb.  Characterizations and story adaptations are so true to the originals, but yet updated in a way that makes it fit today vs. Victorian times.  But Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are the crowning jewels ... Unbelievably good.  What a Series... Can't wait for Series 2 and !!!!!!
B005J79KJG|5.0|I'm surprised that out of all these reviews, no one has chosen to comment directly on the fact this recording is on an open-reel, analog tape. When Zep II came out, open reel was the choice of many audiophiles because it had the potential to avoid all turntable rumble, as well as pops-and-clicks from a vinyl record, while offering better dynamic range, and deeper low end response. And unlike cassettes, the tape \\"hiss\\" from open reel was no worse than surface noise on a typical LP.  We won't know until this tape is played back on a good machine whether the label actually put all that quality into the production of this tape, and that this specific tape has been stored away from magnetic fields and humid conditions.  But what generally was the case is that the master analog tape recording made during the studio session was mixed to a high speed duplicating tape, which in turn became the source for recording the tapes that would be sold at retail, like this one.  As an aside, what a shame that today's MP3 digital recordings have denied listeners the chance to hear a pristine studio take.  MP3, with its nasty digital dirt from compression, is audibly worse than the Compact Disc that made the open reel recording (as well as the DAT format) obsolete on the retail market.  Now, even the CD is obsolete, but no one can defend on a technical basis that we've improved upon the mainstream way we listen to music.  Best wishes to whomever purchases this open reel recording.  It, like the music, is a classic.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Every day I look forward to reading Joyce Meyer's Daily Devotional. Not just because of the content, but because of the functionality of the app. To read the devotional and scripture, and then to be able to easily  share with friends is a dream come true.

0060853980|3.0|These two are the absolute stars of the book.  There were a handful of other good supporting roles, like the Satan nuns and the Four bikers.  But Adam and Them were downright boring.  I even got tired of Anathema and Newton Pulsifer.  And the ending was downright cheesy - Adam's speech seemed like it was written for the children's Saturday morning specials.  This book should have really focused solely on Crowley and Aziraphale because they were the most entertaining, funniest, and likeable characters.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|overall the game isn't to bad. it gives me something to do when I am bored. some of the games are really addictive too.
B003XOAJ7E|5.0|I originally got Notorious when I was 7 years old, and the Strange Behaviour tour (with Erasure opening) was the first concert I ever attended.  I was a Duran fan since I remember, but most of the Notorious album was a bit subtle for my underdeveloped sensibilities.  But, picking up this deluxe set I now appreciate just how good an album this is.  Other reviewers have noted some imperfections, such as the cover scans which should be better. As far as the remaster goes, it sounds fine to me... but I'm not a total audiophile.  The inclusion of the \\"Working for the Skin Trade\\" DVD is really great.  What a fun concert!  And the videos for the album's singles are also included, which I appreciate.  There's only one real original song amongst the b-sides for the album, so you also get a lot of remixes here.  I know I had some of these mixes as a kid, and my brain struggles for vague recollections.  Anyhow, I'm so glad I picked this up.  I also love the Big Thing deluxe set.  Both were albums that I couldn't fully appreciate when they came out (due to my young age), but I tried.  Now I love them.  And the videos are nice depictions of the tours I saw back then.  Also, there's some photo cards and a poster.

B004EPZ07K|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing this movie having been a fan since my childhood. He in fact has always been my favourite Superhero.<br /><br />Having read a number of reviews, I expected the worst and so was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It's a good fun movie. It provides a relatively quick background (unlike Captain America which went too long I thought) and gets us into the action pretty quickly. Ryan Reynolds was a good casting of Hal Jordan and I thought he did a great job and didn't take himself to seriously.<br /><br />I thought the movie was let down by the \\"bad guy\\", a \\"yellow fear\\" of a moving mass that consumes all in its path. And Parallax, what a name. Sounds like a medication.<br /><br />I'd happily see a sequel if there are sufficient DVD sales of this one to warrant it.<br /><br />Bring on The Justice League movie!

I loved that the story was told from a female point of view this time. He uses so many literary references in this book and I love that. I think that he is a genius and everyone should read this book and all of his books! DFTBA!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. It is quick and easy to learn.  I played it all the time on my computer,before my kindle. It is faster and easier to play on the kindle.
B00280LYIC|5.0|very exciting and full of mystery.  i realy liked how well formed the personality of each character was. it is exciting when percy discovers new powers and who realy stole zueses lightning bolt and who his father is. i have read a lot of books and this is deffinatly my favorite book i have ever read by far.
0788812408|5.0|I prefer getting VHS(s) when the DVD I want is in the vault. If you don't have a VHS player, check your local thrift store, I got mine for about seven dollars. Don't buy a VHS player here on Amazon, because they aren't worth the $50-$350 and beyond. The Little Mermaid is one of my favorite Disney Movies, and it's an excellent children's movie. Since Disney is re-releasing Disney classics on the big screen in 3D, if you are unsure if you like the movie, you can wait to see it there.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've tried a bunch of these style apps, from logmein to teamviewer, and nothing compared to the speed and ease of use that this app provides. If you want, you can stream full audio and video using this app. I was watching a video online, and walked away to get food out of the oven, and never had to take a break. Try this,i guarantee you'll like it. Best app I've down loaded
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has been awesome for getting me into the Word on a regular basis. I love the reading plans and the ease of access...waiting to pick someone up, waiting for sports classes, etc...instead of playing a mindless game on my phone, I am reading the Word. when God brings scripture to mind or someone asks me a question, I have the Word right at my fingertips. love this app.
0618836594|5.0|This is a great rendition of the original Polar express book.  I gave it to my son as a day before christmas gift along with the movie and he loves reading it.  My impression was to keep this as an every year read.  I found the audio cd of Liam Neeson to be a nice addition, though I must admit I don't listen to that very often and it was more of a pack away with the book.<br /><br />This edition would seem to work better for a gift that you'd want to use each year, rather then just any book that might be used for general play.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought this item for my grandson.  I liked the color and weight. It helps protect the Kindle from likely abuse from a 12 year old boy. Every Kindle Fire should have one.

B0028IDXDS|3.0|I've heard a few people swear by these things, so obviously they work well for lots of kids.  My baby though would gag whenever she got the nipple into her mouth.  Not really sure why... but she never had Soothies in the hospital or anything and prefers the Avent pacifiers with the wider, flatter nipple.  Also, like many others have noted, it would have been nice if it could be sterilized.  I held the monkey over a pot of boiling water, being careful not to get the nose of the monkey too wet while the pacifier boiled.  Not sure how well it worked, but better than nothing!  The monkey could've been a bit heavier too, as it often fell off of my baby. (She's 4 months, so this would work way better for a kid still being swaddled.)

0385339089|4.0|John Grisham is one of the best at weaving complicated and intellectual plots and then making them accessible reading for everyone.  He keeps a taut thriller with legal elements moving at a pace that can only be produced by the hand of a master.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|I went with my husband 2 preteen sons.  We all loved it.  As the movie was beginning to end I was trying to come up with people that I could go see it with again that hadn't gone yet.  Kermit and Co. are a part of my childhood. It was like meeting up with an old friend.  I laughed and cried.  I wanted more when it was done.  With that being said, if you did not grow up with the Muppets you're probably not going to fall in love with the movie like those of us that watched The Muppet Show on TV.  The movie alone does stand on it's own even without prior introduction Kermit and cast.  The actors in this movie...WoW!  Did not expect so many big names.  Granted that some appearances were minimal but from the interviews I've seen or read, the actors/actresses wanted to be involved.  They, too, had grown up with the Muppets and considered it an honor and a true pleasure.  I love the movie to get the DVD.  I've never pre-ordered a movie...ever.  I promise you that I will be watching it the evening it arrives at my doorstep.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I agonized over getting a sturdier, prettier case after reading complaints about this product's flimsy and cheap exterior, but I am delighted by what came in the mail. It is so light that I hardly notice its presence. The felt-like inside cover has the double advantage of cleaning the screen and, when folded, makes for easy gripping. I chose the graphite color on a whim, and I think the contrast makes it look a bit sleeker and more modern. I also love the strap, unobtrusive but handy.  Cons: It is true that the fold-for-display flap isn't the most sturdy if you are pecking away at the screen, but works just fine if you are watching a video, which is the only way I would want to use that feature. Would definitely recommend!
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I hadn't read any of the books til I went and seen the movie. As soon as I left the theater I went an got the 2nd book. I thought the 2nd book was better, this one ran a little long at times. I do think this series will be the standard set for some time now.

It helps keep me on schedule with my devotion. my only dissappointment is that the NIV versions are not downloadable for my Fire tablet. But the vast majority of versions are there for offline reading. I am seldom away from a wireless connection anyway. I highly recommend this ap!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a fantastic app, it has gotten me to take time out of each day to spend time in the Word.  The only reason I am giving it four stars.is.for the inability to access your reading plan if you don't have a wi-fi connection.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Margin Call is an extremely well done film about the \\"thinking\\" that led to our economic meltdown. Very unsettling too, to learn how little control we have over this sort of thing happening over and over again. It's the nature of our economic system and as such deserves serious discussion. All the actors were excellent in portraying different ways Wall Street types view situations such as this. Loved Simon Baker (as usual) for portraying a conscience-deficient hard-nose. He makes any role he plays come alive. Kevin Spacey as the lead is superb as a guy with a conscience that the system keeps him from using. The only outlet he seems to have for that is his sick and dying dog. This DVD is well worth your time and money - and thought.
B004EPZ08E|5.0|I personally loved this movie and product. This came with DVD + Blueray + Digital Copy. This movie made me laugh throughout the movie and was a great comedy to watch. It is not appropriate for children though because it does use a lot of foul language and there are some nude scenes. There are also some scenes that are not appropriate but it is great humor to me and a lot of mature audiences will find it funny. If you like comedy, give this a try.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|To craft this superb three-and-a-half-hour landmark documentary presented on two separate DVDs, Martin Scorsese reportedly edited down more than 10 hours of source material, so as usual with filmmaking most of the available footage was left on the cutting room floor. The result is a textbook lesson in first-class documentary filmmaking very much in the mould of Scorsese's 1978 release `The Last Waltz' or his excellent film series about the blues.<br /><br />Scorsese's ambition with `No Direction Home' is to tell the story of Bob Dylan's journey from obscure origins in Hibbing Minnesota to international success in the mid-1960s. In 1966 following injuries sustained in a motorcycle accident, he dropped out of the public eye for a couple of years to later re-emerge into the second phase of his long and enigmatic career.<br /><br />The film describes Dylan's time in Greenwich Village NYC in 1961-62 (visiting Woody Guthrie in hospital, playing the folk club circuit and making his first recordings), then uses Dylan's important but at the time controversial UK tour in 1963 as the framework for a revealing montage of concert footage, straight-to-camera interviews with the young Bob and contributions from Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Alan Ginsberg, Al Kooper and others from the period. His embracing of electric instruments and a fuller sound in the teeth of the anger and bewilderment of diehard folk purists is well told, an early character indication of iconoclastic mould-breaking. Dylan is and always has been his own man, does what he wants and answers to no-one; he can come across as hard-as-nails even whilst delivering sentiments of exquisite tenderness.<br /><br />At the end of the film, do we understand more about the 20th century's most important popular musician/poet, the `voice of a generation', and what makes him tick? Well, a bit. Dylan's legendary taciturn personality and cryptic answers to (sometimes unbelievably crass) interview questions is on full display here, and the film really does reveal something of the young man in all his frustrating don't-try-to-pin-me-down complexity. Now aged 70, he ain't changed that much.<br /><br />This is an absorbing, interesting film which never drags, despite its length. Martin Scorsese is very, very good at this game. Even if you're not really a Dylan fan, watch the editing and choice of content to see a master filmmaker at his craft and see how it's done. A follow-up film of Dylan's mid-life and later career from 1970 would be something to look forward to, but will we see the result of such a project? Probably not - more's the pity.the film really does reveal something of the young man in all his frustrating don't-try-to-pin-me-down complexity.

B000GRTQSE|5.0|It's so good to see Bob Dylan continue to create virtual masterpieces after a career spanning almost 50 years, when most former contemporaries have disappeared into obscurity. From his early distinctive Woody Guthrie influenced folk-style, through the years of protest songs as an iconic figure of the 1960s, the truly great albums in the 1970s like \\"Planet Waves\\", \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" and \\"Desire\\", his long collaboration with The Band; through the \\"gospel years\\" and a less creative fallow period to his latter-day renaissance when as a mature musician he once more has produced great and memorable music not because he needs to or has anything more to prove but because he loves it, he has great talent, and he can.<br /><br />Traditional American folk music runs through Dylan's soul like a seam of diamond through ancient granite. If there has ever been a master of the genre who thoroughly understands the core of traditional folk-country in all its forms and permutations, and can stretch the dynamic to occupy new territory, it's Dylan.<br /><br />\\"Modern Times\\" is a satisfying mix spiced with boogie, R&B and lyrical ballads. Dylan's choice of instrumentation (like acoustic double-bass for example, rather than the more obvious electric bass) gives a pre-rock age feel to a collection of faster, positively danceable numbers and slower, more poignant melodies with haunting, memorable lyrics shot through with wry humor. Dylan's uniquely distinctive vocal style has matured into a rich, gravely baritone perfectly suited to his material. No other musician in the early 21st century personifies traditional American folk styles yet makes the music so contemporary, so relevant to the modern age, and for this  reason the album's title is perfect and (probably deliberately) ironic.<br /><br />Dylan is like a phoenix, ever rising from the ashes into new life. That a 65-year old can find new generations of listeners and still produce fresh, distinctive and quality music like this is an almost unique achievement in the modern era. The recent Grammies and chart-topping sales of Dylan's last three albums are well deserved. In the sea of imitative conformity and contrived mediocrity which largely characterizes the contemporary music scene he continues, after 50 years, to teach younger generations of musicians how it's done.<br /><br />It's great driving music, too.<br /><br />Long may he thrive and survive. Respect.almost unique achievement in the modern era. The recent Grammies and chart-topping sales of Dylan's last three albums are well deserved.

Literally kept me on the edge of my seat.  Many people said to me, \\"How can you read that scarey stuff?\\".  Well, all I can say is you can't beat Stephen King for a very thrilling read.  Not scarey, just thrilling.  Can't wait to see both of these books put into movies.  I'll be the first in line.  Thanks Stephen King for two such wonderful reads.  Adds to your long list.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ernest Cline created a future that revels in the past  in this novel, and a huge reason I rated this book 5 stars.  The arcade game \\"Joust\\", Intellivison\\", the movie \\"Wargames\\", many of your favorite 80's cultural phenomenon are not only present but deified in Cline's vision of the future.  Everyone can enjoy Ready Player One, you don't have to enjoy an affinity for 80's culture to enjoy this book though.  The story in its own right is a very enjoyable and worth a five star rating.  It almost seems impossible for anyone to not enjoy this book.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|Casting director did an excellent job. The movie is about a group of backwoods men who have perverted mentalities and are willing to do anything to get what they want,even if it means destroying someone else's life,mentally,physically and emotionally. An author is minding her own business in her \\"lake house\\". writng or creating ideas for her book. Each guy (who lives in the area)all know each other including a no good cop(nothing new) and a mentally challenged like-minded teen ran a \\"train\\" on the author. The author seeks revenge(who could blame her). When the young woman is in motion of getting revenge she does a damn good job,isolating each man by himself and taking her turn of doing as she pleases with them the exact same way.The only thing negative about the movie is,there are too many questions left unanswered. Did this tragic event she experienced make her want to write about it? Did anyone in the little town find out what happened to the men ? Why didn't she bring anything with her to protect herself,especially in (basically) the middle of nowhere ? Did she ever tell her family, her boss what happened ? That's a movie ending for you.

B001HNE3NO|4.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay is a story that is told through two perspectives by two main characters: Sarah and Julia. The story takes place between two different time periods as well: in 1942 and 2002. The history behind this story occurred during the unforgettable event of the Veldrome De' Hiver roundup in Paris, 1942, where an incredible amount of Jewish children and families were transported to a large, abandoned, cycling arena. Julia becomes interested in this subject and begins to research more about this event that has taken place within one European country. However, similar events have also taken place in other countries. The reader starts to learn more about Julia's life and the way it was related to Sarah's. It is known that this story has impacted Julia's decisions, her goals, and overall the way she visualizes life.   This novel starts in the year 1942, Paris, where Sarah is one of the major characters within the story's plot. She experiences locking her younger brother, Michel, into their secret cupboard when French police come into their house demanding and retorting orders for the deportation to camps. She remembers leaving her brother alone and holding the precious key within her fingers, wondering if she will ever meet her brother again. Unfortunately she is sent to the Beaune-la-Ronde, separating from her parents sent to Auschwitz, leaving her brother to his death. Julia is introduced within a great amount of alternating between both time periods. Beginning in 2002, Julia is living in Paris with her husband Bertrand and her daughter Zoe. She is an American journalist who is given the job to write an article. She decides to research about the Veldrome de `Hiver roundup and the ordeals of one family and a ten-year old girl, Sarah. As the story progresses, the reader starts to learn more about Sarah's struggles and dreadful experiences, but also about Julia and her determination in finding the truth behind Sarah's mystery.  Furthermore, the storycovers what really happened during the early 1940's in France, concerning the roundup of Jewish families and their transportations to several concentration camps. Julia is trying to reveal the secrets behind what really happened. She is determined to learn more about Sarah's story. As the novel advances, the reader finds how her own life is linked to Sarah's story. It affects Julia's decisions. The story affects her way of living a well. She is now being divorced from her husband. She is also keeping her child and naming her Sarah. She is appalled by the ignorance of society on their knowledge of the Veldrome de' Hiver. The message of the story however is clear: never forget. Once a story is told it is not forgotten, it just takes one to remember and believe it.   All in all, I believe that this was a very interesting story. The author has definitely placed a large amount of thought into the novel and has resulted in successful work. However I would not recommend this book to an individual who is not interested in the events taking place during the Holocaust. If I were to state one point that did not engage me while reading was the fact that Rosnay tends to use short, choppy sentences that do not seem to flow from one to the other. She also seems to repeat too many of the phrases. Otherwise, the story cannot be underestimated. It is truly a book that when started, is worth finishing.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This movie was motivational, well done, clean and had a wonderful feeling to it.  I had read some of the reviews for it and they had said the acting was poor and the story wasn't portrayed well.  Thank you God I decided to buy the movie to watch it anyway.  I thought it was excellent and will be showing it to others in my family.  Thank you for putting Bethany's spirit and story on film and thank you for the extras you've attached as well.  Its wonderful to have a clean, true life story to show my children that life with hard times is still life and it is what you make of it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It's fun and my daughter loves it! We love that there are so many games in one app! Great games.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I will look for a Bible that I can read anywhere. I do most of my reading while riding in a vehicle and wifi is not available so I can't read it.  there is no time at home with 3 kids running around.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book so much when I finished I immediately downloaded the second and third books. It was totally gripping and I could barely put it down.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Great app. My phone or tablet are all I need to access my computer from anywhere in the house!  Almost turned a laptop into a server.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I can download some versions and read even when there is no Wifi. Love the audio, different versions and searching.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|For those of you looking for a \\"Fireproof\\" sequal, just keep looking. This had all the drama, action, and family moral values of \\"Fireproof\\" and then some! It also had humor and love and the story really strikes at the heart of what being a Christian husband and father is supposed to look like. I am so thankful for another good movie from the Kendrick brothers that I don't have to worry about being offensive to my children. If you are looking for a good movie with firm Christian values, humor that is not crude or nasty, and entertainment the whole family can enjoy, pick up a copy of \\"Courageuous\\" and enjoy!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this app has made my walk with God a closer one. Thank you YouVersion.  Every new version just keeps making it more and more User friendly. Great job. Should be named best app ever made.
0810988232|4.0|Reading over all of the reviews, I understand what people are saying about the quality of the cards.  While mine came in good condition and I don't have any real complaints about them, I can see how people might think them to be a lesser quality than other decks.  I have another deck by another author which is a bit sturdier, but I know that I just need to be a bit more careful with these. I wish the box they came in would have been designed better, because if the cards are stored within it they slosh around-the holder isn't sturdy.  There are Tarot bags created for this purpose and I'll need to buy or make one for the fairie cards.<br /><br />As far as the cards themselves, I love the pictures and have not experienced any difficulty between them and the translations in the book. These cards really resonate with me, and I've had great success in using them.  And I haven't had them for very long.  I began using them as a daily guide as soon as they were given to me as a gift, and from day one I've found them to be very helpful. Perhaps as with other decks, these cards resonate better for some than for others?  I've heard this to be true with various Tarot decks; some work well for certain people, but not for others.  Decks such as this help us pull from our intuition, and sometimes one subject won't vibe as well for a person as another might. Since I love all things Celtic and Faerie, and since these things are part of my heritage, Celtic decks and faerie decks seem to work really well for me. I've seen others that I didn't feel as comfortable with.<br /><br />As far as the extra cards, I thought there was an explanation for these in the included book but can't find it at the moment, so I could be wrong.  The cards are for us to interpret as we're inspired, much the way when doing a Tarot reading one might pull up messages that aren't directly related to the written meaning of the card but are still valid. For instance, I once did a reading for a friend in which I saw an image of lawyers in my head when I was looking at a particular card.  The card itself had nothing to do with legal matters, but it did turn out that she was having legal issues and was involved with lawyers at the time. Looking at the card,I, for whatever reason, saw that she was surrounded by legal professionals and was troubled by it. When doing a reading, the idea isn't just to spit back exactly what the books that come with the cards say, but to derive our own interpretations as well, and weave them into the original meaning of the cards.  This has always worked well for me; I'm not sure what works for others and certainly there is more than one way to do a reading.<br /><br />Anyway,I don't have the other deck but am now interested in obtaining it! I love the one I have but am curious about the other, since it seems like so many people enjoy it more than the Heart of Faerie Oracle.s in my head when I was looking at a particular card.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is one of the cool games because, it's not jest one game it's 101 games. see you earn points so you can unlock more games and more games and on. it's the best game I ever played.
1932735410|4.0|I am preparing for my PMP exam (my exam is scheduled a few days before Christmas) and I'm a bit worried as I don't know if the book that I'm using to study for PMP and this book really help me.PMI's Project Management Professional credential is the most important industry-recognized certification for project managers. I highly support this book.
B003UMW68Y|2.0|I thought the DVD I was getting was one that could be EITHER regular or Blue Ray. I don't have a blue ray player so it's useless to me. But since I've already opened the package, I guess I can't return it. The gift card I used was a Christmas present from my son.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I purchased this for my kindle fire so I could edit files for work on the go. I wasn't after anything fancy, just serviceable.  This more than fits the bill.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|So my wife read the book earlier this year and I decided to get her the movie for Christmas. I had no interest in watching the \\"Chick Flick\\" because it basically didn't have any thing blowing up.<br /><br />I would like to be the first to say I was wrong, very wrong. The Help is both an enlightening and moving film. It's hard to believe that we have a portion of our history that is that twisted. If you are not familiar with the movie it's the story of life in Mississippi in the 60's from the point of view of the African-American help. They were allowed to love and raise the children of the local socialites but not able to share in simple things like using the indoor toilet.<br /><br />The movie is not an us against them film; it does a good job of highlighting when the help and their employers had good healthy relationship, the wrongs that they suffered through, and deep loving impact that the Help had on the children in the film.<br /><br />It was easily the best film I've ever watched. I found myself sad at times, angry other time, and sometimes laughing my head off. Do yourself a favor and watch the film you will not regret the time you invest.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Once again-- not a disappointment!!!  This book was everything I wanted it to be-- Finally Christian becomes the man we wanted him to be!! Ana is so patient and strong in this book-- I enjoyed every word in this book-- Never wanted the book to end.. I hope this series continues-- such a fun romantic read- with vanilla & kinky to add to it...
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put this book down!!  It has been a very long time since I have felt this way about a book & author.  There are only two things I don't like regarding this book (& the series) #1 is that it took me this long to read them!  I only just read them last week(all three). I absolutely could not put them down.  Before I finished The Hunger Games I had already downloaded Catching Fire & Mockingjay to my Kindle Fire so I could keep reading about these amazing characters.  #2 I am sad that I am finished and have no more books for my Katniss & Peeta addiction!!  Of course I will definetly be rereading this trilogy countless times!  Suzanne Collins is a wonderful story teller & I can't wait for her next book!  I am beyond excited for the movie---March 23, 2012 can't get here soon enough!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Many different bible versions. I like the reading plans. I wish there was an easy way to create my own custom reading plan.

140131046X|5.0|Mitch Albom is asked by his childhood Rabbi to give the Rabbi's eulogy. Several times, over the next eight years, Mitch interviews the Rabbi. These interviews provide the basis of a spiritual journey.   During the same time frame that Mitch is seeing the Rabbi, Mitch also comes across a Christian preacher named Henry. Mitch develops a strong bond with both men. The relationships between Mitch and Henry and Mitch and the Rabbi form a synergy in Mitch's own existential quest.   The life experiences that the Rabbi and Henry share with Mitch are full of wisdom. For example, on page 39, Mitch summarizes one of the Rabbi's stories by writing, \\"The most inspirational man I knew only reached his potential by helping a child reach his.\\"   For those who want to read about the struggles of good people and the wisdom they gained from these experiences I highly recommend this book.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The app worked great. I had no type of frame rate issues. Became very challenging after a while. Great update to the old school Missile Defense.
0321213351|5.0|This book was exactly what I was looking for.  While understanding the GoF Design Patterns is useful, this book goes into sufficient detail to explain them (and online searches for the DP's is easy enough).  The book expands into naming the various refactoring so as to have a shared language describing (naming) those refactoring methodologies.  Overall I have been pleased with the level of detail and content.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really enjoy this game. lots of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone. hours of fun for all. if you don't pay for points takes long time to open longs of fun.
B002WY65VU|5.0|I purchased Zombieland online after going to several stores to find it only to turn up empty-handed. Apparently it's not a hot Christmas gift, but it was what my step-sister wanted. :) It was way cheaper than I expected and it came the day after I ordered it! I was impressed by the promptness. Thanks!
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|This was an absolutely fantastic way to end the series. We got to see the love, tenderness, tenacity of the characters. We got to see them struggle, enjoy each other, and hate each other...I wanted to hate both of the main characters at different times in the book. I love Ana's need to keep herself grounded now that she's married to a mega-millionaire, I love that she wants Christian to be more open, how they both struggle with this, but that they trust and love each other enough to work on this. I love how it seems to be Ana and Christian vs the world at some points.  Oh MY I want to re-read this entire series again and again!!

B000SMWUPS|1.0|I loved this for my baby jogger city mini, but after 8 months of use, the straps literally came right off.  Also, strings kept unraveling off of the velcro straps used to fasten it to the handle.  It was a great buy, but had I known that it was not well made, I would have sprung for a more expensive model.  Not sure which one I will be going for next round.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|The product is as advertised and I compared it to price in the store, and it was a great deal for this set.  My son was thrilled!
B003Y74AXO|5.0|This Protector and Cleaning Cloth is in use on the iPad at our house and I couldn't give it higher marks.  It does a wonderful job w/out diminishing screen clarity and the cleaning cloth is gentle and does a fabulous job.  Way to go, AmazonBasics!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|For starters, it's safe to say this is a puzzle and text-based game. There is a lot of reading and dialogue, and no actual player-controlled movement (besides clicking an arrow to go in that direction). Long story short, this game will make you think; you cannot just rush through this game, skipping (or speeding through) all of the words, like you can with many other games, and expect to do well.<br /><br />  Here's how the game-play works: you read a decent amount of words which bring you into the current situation, and you are advised what is going on by reading. You then use the touch screen to solve puzzle-like games within this game to advance and progress throughout the story.<br /><br />  Without giving much away, the story itself starts out pretty much like this: you awake after being knocked out and kidnapped against your will. You are in a small room, and have no idea what is going on. You then find out a few things, and realize that you are on a ship of some sort. You then escape the room you start in, and find eight other people. You talk with them, and you all decide to work together to try to escape the ship. All nine of you are told that the only way to escape the ship is by partaking is a cruel, sick, and twisted game in which all of your lives' will be on the line, in which you must all work together to \\"win\\" (survive). In the end of the game, there are six different endings, each with its own unique outcome. The outcomes will depend on your decisions and choices throughout the story. The goal is to try to imagine if it were real; what would you do (if you were given the choices that you are given in the game)? Try to make rational decisions and try not to let emotions get in the way, and play it out.<br /><br />  This is not like any other DS game that I can think of. It is unique in its own way, and I really did enjoy playing through it six times (getting each ending one time). You can beat it the first time in about 30-40 hours or so, and each additional run-through will probably be about 10-30 hours, depending on how hard you try and how much you really care about trying to survive (in-game, of course). The first time I played it (my first run-through), I tried to put myself into the game as much as I could, and I let my personal emotions get in the way too much, and I ended up getting brutally murdered by an axe. I won't be making that mistake again. >.&lt;<br /><br />  Anyways, overall, I'd give this game a 10/10. This is one of the few games that I really, really did enjoy. It is number ten in my \\"Top 10\\" games list, which might not mean much to you, but I have played literally hundreds if not thousands of games in my life, and this is one of the greatest, in my opinion. If you like suspense and getting totally hooked and drawn into a game, then this is great for you. I personally dislike reading a lot, and despite all of the reading in this game, it is a GREAT game. Trust me.<br /><br />  Ok, so I'll end by saying that I didn't actually buy the game from Amazon, so I'm not reviewing my experience with Amazon, or the shipping or anything like that; I'm reviewing the game \\"9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors\\" for the Nintendo DS handheld gaming system. I hope you liked my review.<br /><br />  - God bless. -ably be about 10-30 hours, depending on how hard you try and how much you really care about trying to survive (in-game, of course).

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Got this on sale for $5 right before getting the other 2 suites. Still a great purchase. The document and spreadsheet interface is great on both my tablet (Iconia a500) and phone (G2). Superior to the other popular office apps.  However, QuickOffice (pro or trial) does a much better job rendering PDFs quickly and has a more functional interface. Additionally, OfficeSuite is not well integrated with cloud retrevial, and does not allow documents to be saved into PDF format. Combined this means while it has all the formatting you want the ability to convert it into a polished file without all the &quot;word&quot; markup is a cumbersome process.  I look forward to cloud support and the ability save as PDF. Without that, it is not a stand-alone product, but still one worth having.

B002UDFNNO|5.0|I read this book as a teen, long before I met the love of my life who convinced me to finally take the leap and go to Paris. The first year, before I could afford school which allowed me to apply a working visa, I wasn't much better off than Mr. Orwell's character working under the table, at menial jobs. I worked watching spoiled kids and in overpriced restaurants with abysmal kitchens and descrete restaurants with excellent food and spotless kitchens, happily, just to be living the dream. I met people who were just happy to be in the presence of a magical New York American. After I got my working visa, I had night club and office jobs. All the jobs I had the pleasure of being employed at began with the staff gathering for a meal and wine before the shift, and ended with our gathering at the cafe for wine and coffee.<br /><br />I had long ditched the Anglophone safety of the American and Irish bars, for the seduction of art, romance, conversation, music that is the magnetic force of Paris. From the bookish scientists and engineers, to the people from all French colonized countries, who religiously slay live animals in courtyards to be eaten in foyers with those of the same faith, or just broke hungry folk like me, to the avante garde elderly musicians who perform musical theater on the perepherique, et the youth who perform live Reggae sur les bateaux; the friend who becomes your lover and vice-versa, enlightening you for the next interaction; everyone is a philosopher and all spend hours debating history as it relates to current politics/their personal philosophy, . The lights, the language, the sights, the food, the love, the accordion music, the cathedral bells.....<br /><br />I have survived on one bottle of red, a stale baguette, and a bottle of water, shared with true friends. I have dined on the finest fare in the company of true friends. I have been loved with abandon and hated as well in Paris. I would not change a single moment of my life there. For the years that I was there I was a happy Parisienne in Paris. Isle St. Louis, Trocadero, Cours de Vincennes, Chatelet Les Halles and Centre Georges Pompidou, Montmatre, Rue St. Jacques:)<br /><br />I lived a unique year in London, but that's another story.<br /><br />Now as lady luck has stopped spoiling the west, I am re-familiarizing myself with the reality of doing with less with an attitude of gratitude. It seemed easier to do when I was surrounded by 1200 year old works of art, and several hundred year old magnificent architecture to walk along the cobblestoned streets and contemplate my next move, but I cannot say that I have not lead a charmed life, before and after. I have been blessed.<br /><br />I will absolutely always have Paris. Much love to the young man who paved my way to Paris, all those years ago.<br /><br />Big shouts and love to my long-time friend and Paris benefactor:) Richard Shalhani, owner of my favorite restaurant SAVANNAH CAFE . 27,rue Descartes, Paris, France. 01 43 29 45 77 Hope to see you soon!
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|How do you rebound from a cliff hanger like Marshall and Lily breaking up? Right where you left off.<br /><br />Season two starts moments after we learn about the split with Barney and Robin rushing to Marshall's side. I love that they let the break up go on for a while and didn't opt for a quick one episode fix. Therein lies a big reason I feel that the show is so wildly successful, because they explore real situations. They realize break ups hurt and they let Marshall hurt...and hurt...and hurt some more. All the while his friends rally around him to help him try and forget, or at least not dwell on, what happened. In classic HIMYM form, some very funny results ensue, from Barney taking him to a strip club to Ted taking him to a baseball game (ending with Marshall freaking out on a newly engaged couple) and Robin, of course, taking him to the gun range.<br /><br />Now that's not all that happens. Of course, Robin and Ted are officially an item so we get ample comedy from them. Lily comes back from San Francisco to commence a funny round of apartment hunting. Ted finds out his parents got a divorce. And Barney...well, Barney does what Barney does best, chases women. All of that leads up to Marshall and Lily's wedding.<br /><br />Their wedding could've been handled in so many different ways, and it could've failed in so many ways. However, they cover the wedding over the span of two episodes. Everything from pre-wedding jitters to how everything will always go wrong, to their own private ceremony headed by none other than Barney. They did it perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, season two builds upon what season one started in all the right ways. There are no midseason lulls, only laughs offered throughout. With huge heart and a wonderful cast there's nothing missing.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game for it being free some games difficult others easy to rack up the coins to buy other mini games.
0525478817|5.0|This is a beautiful book.  I am caught in the wave of excitement surrounding the release but think I would have loved this book if I'd pulled it randomly from the YA shelf at the library.  There is so much about the universe that is just not fair (insert stomping feet) and it's not easy to talk about those parts of life.  The story unfolds and enfolds you and at the end you have a few more words to wrestle with the unfairness of it all.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is wonderful and I really enjoyed playing it all the way through.  I can't wait to play reflect!
1400069181|4.0|I spent my winter break contemplating my future. Constant worries about where my place should be in the world filled my mind. That is, until I read Start Something That Matters by Blake Mycoskie. The thing is, I never really knew what I wanted to do with my life and when I read Mycoskie's book I realized that I want to make a positive impact in the world and dedicate myself to causes that inspire me.  I have always admired TOMS and its movement of helping children in need by giving, but after reading this book I became inspired by the social good that they have created. And so, that's where the book begins: the TOMS story. Don't worry, Mycoskie isn't selling the TOMS brand or himself, he wrote this book to motivate others to get out there and well...\\"start something that matters.\\" As he tells the story of TOMS, he weaves in the stories of method, charity:water, FEED Projects, and TerraCycle to guide readers in getting their organizations started. With these lessons and a six-step (just, six steps!) blueprint, Start Something That Matters, could easily be sold as a motivational guide to entrepreneurs. Throughout the book, Mycoskie is illustrative if not, extremely motivating and helpful.  By the end of the book, Mycoskie's presents a challenge for its readers in hopes of inspiring them to make a difference in their community or even the world. \\"For me, the ultimate success of this book will be not by how many copies it sells but by the number of people it inspires and the number of letters we receive.\\"  I also found what Blake wrote quite inspiring. Here are a few of my favorites:  \\"If you're like me and most of the people I know, you yearn for something more than just business success. You're searching for meaning. You want to have this time and freedom to do the things you love and contribute to making the world a better place.\\"  \\"When you have a memorable story about who you are and what your mission is, your success no longer depends on how experienced you are orhow many degrees you have or who you know. A good story transcends boundaries, breaks barriers, and open doors.\\"  \\"A lack of resources i not reason to avoid starting a company. If anything, it often inspires creativity and a competitive edge.\\"  \\"Don't make giving an afterthought. Figure out how to make it a responsible part of what you are creating.\\"  Start Something That Matters is definitely a good read. A simple and creative book for:  Those who want to break away from standard textbook business models  Those who are inspired by social entreprenuership  Those who are ready to make a difference in the world  Every business starts somewhere and Blake wants to show that you can \\"love your work, work for what you love, and change the world at the same time.\\"  It is possible.

B0055Q5F36|4.0|I bought several cases for my Galaxy S2, so I could try the one I most liked and sell the other in my country.  I liked it because: the protection is really nice, you can feel your equipment is very well protected in all sides, the quality of materials used are very nice and the finish is really well done. It also have rubber cover for all the conections and holes in the S2, which the Ballistic does not have.  I didn't liked it because: in comnparison with the Balistic case there is less protection in the corners. It is also more dificult to put it on the S2. The plastic cover on the outside is hard and have a fine texture, I scratched it very easily by just using it for 2 days, the Balistic in comparison have a more rubbery finish wich does not \\"absorb\\" scratches. And finally the rubber bessel along the sides of the glass is shallow, it does give some protection but could be a bit more higher compared to the Ballistic case.  It is impossible to not make a comparison with the Ballistic case since both are very similar. So in short the OtterBox in my opinion have a more low profile, simple case then the Ballistic and indeed give a very good protection level to your expensive S2, the Ballistic is just a bit more nice and give a bit more protection just that.  In short I liked it.

B005FLX2WC|5.0|I bought my dad some other Joe Bonamassa cds and a blue-ray for Christmas and bought this one on a chance that it was good and he would enjoy something different.  The reviews swayed me and I read that others enjoyed this as well.  My dad was surprised and he said that it was a really cool cd.  If my dad says it is cool, then it is cool!

Well after my dad got the chance to listen to this cd a few times, he made me listen to it so I could see how cool it was too.  I'm a fan of John Hiatt and have seen him in the Songwriters Tour, so I enjoyed this new cd, and I know my dad really enjoyed it!

1451627289|5.0|This is only the second book by King I have read, the first about the  world series  Red Sox.  I found it fun and very readable.  Great mixture of  facts and fantasy.
0307454894|3.0|The Reader by Bernard Schlink is set after World War II and begins with fifteen-year-old Michael Berg becoming ill with hepatitis.  He is found by a woman, cleaned up, then sent home.  That woman is Hanna Schmitz.  He returns to her home, and they soon begin a passionate love affair that will affect him the rest of his life.  Their affair lasts the duration of a summer, and then, inexplicably, she disappears from his life.  Approximately eight to ten years later, she reappears when he is observing a trial; Hanna is under investigation.  I found this book to be very simply written and a pretty quick read.  There was no over-embellishment and nothing flowery about Mr. Schlink's writing, which I appreciated.  Because of the simplicity of his writing, I felt that the emotions in the book were not way-layed by excessive description.  Everything pertained to the story.  However, because of the way the story is written, I feel that it undertones the crimes that Hanna is accused of, thereby dulling the severity of her actions involving the Holocaust.  I felt that the trial section of The Reader was shallow and unconvincing.  I feel that Hanna's illiteracy is a metaphor for the Third Reich's lack of morals.  She is almost a representative of the German people for being unable to \\"read\\" the signs of the mass murders being committed essentially in their name.  Her Nazism, like many other Germans of the time, was not intentional.  The Reader also comes off as an anti-illiteracy campaign; imagine how much different Hanna's life would be if she were able to read.... all of the choices she made pertaining to her future were because of her inability to read.  I enjoyed the story and the writing, but the issues involved in the story seemed so glibly written that I cannot give Mr. Schlink's The Reader any more than 3 stars.
140053271X|2.0|Got a Nook Simple Touch about a month ago. I successfully set up the WiFi to communicate with my home WAP-protected router. After that first time, WiFi never worked again. It always says the connection was unsuccessful. Obviously the password and SSID were correct since it worked the first time. Wiped out the old settings, re-entered everything: no dice. This device has buggy wireless software so I do not recommend it unless you are willing to always download your books from a USB connection to a wired computer. Honestly, that USB download process is buggy too. At first, a downloaded book showed up on the USB Nook-drive icon on the computer, where I drag-and-dropped it into the Library folder, and would NOT show up in the Nook library display. But then a few days later it decided to show up on the Library list on the Nook too. I have 3 computers on secure home wireless and they all worked the first time and 100% of the time after too. Not the Nook. It's at 3% and going down. At least it can still read a book which somehow actually got downloaded. From what I've read, calling B&N tech support is a waste of time. Besides, I'm an experienced electronics engineer. It's not like I've never done this stuff before. Garbage software, grossly inadequate SW QA.
0385535139|5.0|John Grisham continues to be one of my favorite authors.  I don't usually do surveys and reviews, but in this case I feel it is necessary, because I want John to continue to write his wonderful books.  I do lose sleep over them as it is difficult to put one down once I have started it. I think I have all his novels and reread them regularly.  Keep up the good work, John Grisham!

1932100660|5.0|The enormous amount of positive reviews is promising. However, I see a huge problem: a lot of these reviews and/or comments have been up since 2004-05. This is 2012 now. It's been 7-8 years since humankind could have been informed of what is at stake in \\"The China Study\\". Has Dr. Campbell been requested by the governments of the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany or France? Are politicians in any way interested in spreading this information to the masses?<br /><br />I don't think so. I am a resident of Mexico, a country where obesity has become a national disaster. The Health Minister is spending huge amounts of money trying to make people conscious of the fact that obesity is an undesirable condition. But this government, like the USA counterpart or any of the other governments in the world aren't doing anything about the need to radically change the feeding habits!<br /><br />Is there a group of people already studying the transition of a society fed with animal protein, to a society fed with whole plant food? Have they thought of a soft migration process? It's unacceptable, unethical, to continue ignoring, even at official levels, what \\"The China Study\\" implies.<br /><br />My wife had been a vegetarian for spiritual reasons, but she did include dairies in her diet. I was a passionate lover of cheese, milk, beef, pork, chicken, eggs. My transition from that to whole plant food took exactly 1 split second. At that moment I wrote and sent to my extended family e-mail group a message stating my determination to never, ever take into my mouth any animal piece of \\"food\\". It's been 10 days since the radical change; all I can say is that I had never, ever in my 62 years alive, felt better, with more energy and with a better balance between anxious activity and carefully planned, step by step actions.<br /><br />After watching the documentary \\"Forks Over Knives\\", then reading \\"Keep it Simple, Keep it Whole\\" and finally reading \\"The China Study\\", I can't think of anybody who would continue playing the \\"Animal Protein Roulette\\": it's like you have a revolver with about 200 bullet chambers and only 1 bullet; every single time you pull the trigger, you have 1 probability in 200 of killing yourself, but since for some unknown reason it feels so good to pull the trigger, you continue doing it!<br /><br />Everything I need is in the whole plant food. I can feel it in my whole body now. The real pleasure is living inside a healthy body with an active mind. Personally, I have solved my life problem. I'm trying really hard to convince my children: the oldest one (38, woman) was already a vegetarian, but has now dropped all animal protein from her diet; the next one, (28, woman) might more difficult to convince, but I know that if she reads \\"The China Study\\", she will immediately understand the whole picture; my son, (26) will go along with us, once he senses that we are all convinced; my youngest daughter (21) is already working on the process.<br /><br />This is something we need to, at least, spread amongst our closest family and friends. Bragging about anything is a hassle, but not bragging about amounts to keeping silence while you see them playing the \\"Animal Protein Roulette\\" or \\"The APR Game\\".<br /><br />This book should have already been translated into all the languages of the world. I don't know if there is a Spanish translation. I would certainly make it a point to give it as a gift to all my close friends and relatives. But the most important is that our governments move on and behave responsibly on this issue.

B0055QYKQO|5.0|The first thing that drew me to this board was the all-black color scheme. I plan on buying a case with an all-black interior, and this board will look great for what I'm trying to achieve. After reading many good reviews about this board and taking suggestions from a Gigabyte fanboy friend of mine, I dropped the $$$ for it. So far it's performed perfectly with my Phenom II 965BE. There's more USB than I know what to do with and headers for 4 additional USB 2.0 ports and 2 USB 3.0 ports. The board comes with several decals, the driver disc, and 4 black SATA cables, 2 of which have a 90-degree connector on one end. Of course, the I/O shield is in there also.  The BIOS is very robust and has the capability of saving up to 10 profiles. Coming from an Asus M2N, I was a taken aback by just how many settings there are in this board's BIOS. I've done a lot of reading since getting this board just to learn what everything does. The board does not have a RAM multiplier setting to support DDR3-1866 at the stock reference clock, so you'll have to play around with that if you're planning on running your RAM at that speed. It does have overclock profiles for several RAM speeds of 2000 and above, but I haven't tried using those yet. So far I've managed to get my CPU to 3.7GHz on stock cooling and voltage. The NB and HT links are both sitting at 2200MHz at stock voltage and stay stable in prime95. Anything above those speeds requires additional juice. The UD5 and UD7 boards are still having vboost and vdroop problems without hardmodding. From my experience with the F5 BIOS and the addition of PLL on the rev. 1.1 board, I have seen no vdroop at all. The board does overvolt the CPU compared to the BIOS settings, but that's a simple fix. Under load, the board typically pushes about .015v to the CPU.  A feature that's new to me that's made me very happy is the on/off charge. I have a wireless gaming mouse and headset, so being able to plug these in at bedtime and still turn off the computer is great. It charges extremely fast also. Just guessing, it charges my iPhone around twice as fast as my previous board and it seems to charge faster than the wall charger also.  This is a great board and if you don't need the luxury of tons of PCIe ports like the UD5 and UD7, this board will make you happy.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|After purchasing my Fire, I wanted a case to protect it from bumps and bruises while I carried it around in my purse.  I really like this case.  It simply snaps on and you're ready to go.  The outside is a hard shell.  I find it easy to hold and less slippery than the Fire by itself.  All the ports and on/off button are exposed, so you don't ever have to take your Fire out of the case.  The inside of the front flap is a soft velvet to help protect the face of the Fire.  I don't find the prop/stand feature on this case very good.  But for me that wasn't a big drawback, because I always either hold it or lay it down flat.  If you think you'll want to prop your Fire up very much, then this may not be the case for you.  But it you just want a nice, sturdy case to help protect your Fire, then this is the one.  I do wish they offered more colors than just black, grey and pink.  But that's a minor point.

B004LWZW9C|2.0|I hated and loved 2010's \\"Valentine's Day\\", Garry Marshall's attempt at \\"Love Actually\\". This film had almost two dozen big names, and had stories that I had seen done in countless films before. There was nothing original about it, but it was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. In the end, I did kind of like it. I hated the way that it didn't give its characters enough time to grow into anything more but caricatures, but it made me smile. I enjoyed the ways that the stories came together in the end, I guess you could say.  I was hoping that \\"New Year's Eve\\", which may as well have been a sequel to \\"Valentine's Day\\", having the same filmmakers, and a slew of other big names, would be an improved version of \\"Valentine's Day\\". This one had the exact same effect. It had half-stories that felt extremely gimmicky, a cast that was eager to please, but didn't have any place to go, because they weren't given anything interesting to do. I blame Katherine Fugate for doing to this, what she did to \\"Valentine's Day\\" a few years ago.  I like a GOOD romantic comedy. I can forgive an unrealistic or unoriginal story if the cast is amiable and charming enough, but this one is unforgivable. I had a nice time at the actual movie, because it was pleasant enough for me to temporarily overlook its obvious shortcomings. It threw its two dozen fantastic actors (this time including some Oscar winners such as Hilary Swank, Halle Berry and Robert DeNiro) into trivial scenarios that end up being less than they began, which is saying alot.  For examples of why this film is so ridiculous, I will bother to explain some of its idiotic excuses for plotlines. Katherine Heigl plays the scorned woman, who was broken up with by Jon Bon Jovi the previous New Year's. Robert DeNiro is a dying man whose last wish before dying is to see the ball drop in Times Square one last time before he croaks, and Halle Berry is his nurse. \\"Little Miss Sunshine\\"`s Abigail Breslin is a rebellious teenager who wants to goto a party, and her mother (Sarah Jessica Parker) won't let her.  These stories have been done to death, and the characters are caricatures once again. The festive nature of New Year's makes it watchable, albeit barely. I enjoyed seeing so many actors that I recognized, but they were simply not given enough material to work with, that could have possibly saved this train wreck. For example, I love Sofia Vergara on the television program \\"Modern Family\\", because she is absolutely hilarious, making a character that could have been a dry caricature her own, and making her character detailed and exciting. She only brings life to the few scenes that she is given, although she is reduced to a \\"sidekick\\" role who doesn't even have her own story line.  I was glad to see Lea Michele working in a project that wasn't \\"Glee\\", but she has a stupid part in this, playing a background singer (yeah right...) who is stuck in an elevator with Ashton Kutcher, who apparently hates everything about New Year's. I understand the characters in \\"Valentine's Day\\" who hated the holiday that the film was celebrating, but come on now. Who hates new year's?  While I don't understand how this film's budget was large enough to pay all of its actors, I can tell that the script was probably scribbled down in a few hours. Not very much attention and money was paid to cinematography, and there is an upsetting amount of product placement scattered throughout the film. Like I said, I had a nice time watching this. I thought it was a pleasant way to spend a few hours. But now that it is the new year, it has zero re-watch value. Once I thought about the film that I had seen, I realized how easy it was to hate.  Grade: D+

So I decided to add another case fan [[ASIN:B002XISTXM Ultra Silent 140mm Fan NF-P14 FLX (Brown)]] in order to keep anything cool and quiet.

0198326769|5.0|I was very impressed with this book. It was an easier read for me, but with the viewpoint from a child using simplistic language, it was captivating and I could not stop reading it. I have read many Holocaust novels, and they are normally from the point of view of a Jewish family or a young teen struggling under the pressure and fear of concentration camps. This book was a refreshing change of view, with a naïve young boy thinking the concentration camp behind his new house is a farm called \\"Out-with\\" where the people wore matching pajamas. His naïve attitude is innocent at first, but once his opinion of the war is contrasted to his new friend's inside the \\"farm\\", it is both heartbreaking and interesting to see the effect on Shmuel, and how his and Bruno's friendship develops.

B004I8WD6E|4.0|Hard to complain about a 9$ case!  Screen protector easily and smoothly went on the face.  Case is snug on the 4s but not difficult to put on or take off.  Nice clear material--even the swirls on the back are good looking.  Only complaint is that the bumper prevents my phone from sitting properly in a docking station.  Bit of a hassle to remove the case each time I plug it in.  Overall though, I'd certainly recommed to a friend!
0062082353|1.0|The author is not much more than a thug. Yes, he saved lives and his kind of person is probably a necessary evil during war, but I think it is completely unnecessary to revel in the memories of a cold blooded murderer. He stated more than once that he ENJOYED his work.  His basic philosophy states \\"God, Country, Family\\". It seems skewed, especially if you happen to be someone in his family.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you haven't played the original before, I would suggest starting there.  The original is a classic and will get you acclimated to the fundamentals of this brilliant puzzle game.<br /><br />Quell Reflect is more complicated than the original by virtue of the additional puzzle elements.  These include<br />- Multiple raindrops:  Instead of one mover, you now have two or more.  This makes the number of possible moves exponentially higher than before.  It also makes the game far more difficult.<br />- Poisonous red drops:  These drops (non-movable) cannot be touched or your raindrop mover \\"dies\\".<br />- Bronze balls: Collect these to knock through the bronze walls, accessing different parts of the puzzle<br />- Wooden spikes: These spikes can be pushed around from the non-prickly sides in order to access strategic parts of the puzzle.<br />- Transport rings:  These rings transport you to different parts of the puzzle and maintain the direction through which they are passed.<br /><br />The first Quell was great fun and really addictive.  I finished it in about two days.  About halfway through Reflect and things are getting REALLY tough.  It's going to take me far longer to finish this one.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic game for your tablet or smartphone.

0316056863|2.0|Tina Fey is a very talented, very funny actress. Her book is not very good; half-way through it I had to give up on it because I felt I was wasting my time. The amazingly positive reviews of this book are really unjustified. The reviewers in fact praise the actor Tina Fey, not her really modest book. There are some funny passages, but overall the tone of the book is predictable (the self-deprecating narrator; her clumsy incidents; etc.) and not amusing.  I do not recommend it.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is awesome - in the sense that it is awe inspiring. The book pulls you into the story of Augustus and Hazel, making you feel every emotion that they do and more. In the book its self, there was a quote: \\"Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with a weird evangelical zeal, and you become convinced that the shattered world will never be put back together unless and until all living humans read the book.\\" That is how I would describe this.  I highly recommend buying this book! I know it seems odd, but I bought both the eBook and the hardback (I like to have my favorite books in actual book form...) It is a worth while purchase, I promise you.
B005WMQ5R8|3.0|I was really looking forward to this one based on the reviews but I just couldn't get into it.  I'm not a fan of the animation style or the characters.  There's also not much in the way of plot or character development.  They do include some nice extras on the making of the film.  They did mention in the extras that they had to take out a lot of the story.  It's eye candy to be sure and I appreciate what the makers were trying to do.  I do agree that the soundtrack is great.  There were moments towards the end that I enjoyed though.
B005LJK3AC|2.0|This one had SOOOO much potential - great premise, great cast and could have been really cathartic for the thousands of us who have worked for borderline sociopaths. The Kevin Spacey character is a retread of his character from \\"Swimming with Sharks\\", a far better dark comedy with a similar plot-line, and comes closest to being successful. The Colin Ferrel character is relatable, but they really missed the potential for some great, crass humor, going instead for a few fat jokes and the like. The Jennifer Anniston character is an absolute cop-out, though. There is great potential in exploring the tough female boss, who overcompensates for her perceived shortcomings or for inherent sexism by being TOO aggressive (I've worked for a PRIME example), but instead they go for the fantasy character of the sexy nympho boss. This plotline is completely unbelievable and ridiculous. What could have been an excellently dark cathartic comedy ends up being unforgivably lazy.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Holiday Inn is just that, a holiday treat.  It has in it two of Hollywoods historic stars, bing Crosby and Fred Astaire.  I remember seeing it when it first came out and, since then, on TV.  Now I can watch it at home whenever the  spirit moves me - and I expect that will be often!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|a fun game to play when you have time to kill.  I wish you didn't have to earn so many points to unlock other games.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its cool if u r bored and passes time fast. even tho some of the games are kinda hard they're still fun
B004EFYZ1C|3.0|I had this as live wallpaper until this morning. I liked it.  it doesn't seem to live well with ice on my xoom.  I had multiple crashes when exiting multiple different apps after my ice ota upgrade yesterday.. I finally stopped the crashing by removing the live wallpaper..  this might be an ice bug. I don't know.  otherwise, I'd give this a 4 star.. not 5, since they need more contrast, as everything looks like a full moon unless you look closely.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Its. a good game that can keep you busy for a while but some games are hard and its annoying to have to earn points.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the ease and options. thx for incorporating a lot of great tie in's. looking forward to a new update to see what else you can do.
B000002URV|5.0|I bought this CD for the 2nd time (1st time came up missing in a move).  This is PERFECT relaxation, meditation, or that special night with that special someone.  Take a listen, it is definitely music to take you down whatever road your mind wonders.
0060873027|1.0|Simply awful. A dumb story, with stereotypical characters. Imagine: shrinking people. How many times have we seen this movie? I expect Hollywood to be most interested because they can turn this into a digital special effects bonanza, since after our intrepid good guys get shrunk by Dr. Cyclops, they have adventures! What this is is a micro-world version of Jurassic Park, too similar to the original, in some respects, to constitute honorable work. How did this get published? As an editor, you'd have to have a mighty contemptuous attitude toward the reading public to let this one pass muster. Avoid at all costs. Burn it if a friend makes the mistake of giving you a copy. NB: this is an insult to the life and work of Michael Crichton.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I notice that some reviews refer to the DVD while others to the Blu-ray.  I already owned the Restored Edition DVD, and while it was much much better than the original, I have to say the Blu-ray is amazing!<br /><br />When I first started watching, I thought it was too grainy.  There are some scenes that appear a little too sharp in Blu-ray, especially the sky.  I'm guessing they sharpened the image to bring out detail in some scenes.  However, when compared side by side with the DVD, there is no comparison.  I have seen this movie more times than I can count, but it was like watching for the first time!  The colors are so much brighter, first of all.  In scenes where I had previously thought the characters were wearing very similar dresses, I realized they were different colors.  Also, the textures and patterns can be seen that were previously not visible.  I can hear the clocks chiming in the background that couldn't be heard with the original version (I first heard them in the Restored Version DVD).<br /><br />If you are trying to decide whether to upgrade to the Blu-ray, I would highly recommend it!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|[[ASIN:0792833236 Raging Bull]], [[ASIN:B004LOJPLQ The Fighter]], [[ASIN:B001EC2IYE Million Dollar Baby]], [[ASIN:B0017VT5E8 Rocky]], and Warrior are all films about personal issues and challenges faced by someone who seriously kicks ass. All of them are excellent films with excellent writing. Warrior is my personal favorite of those 5 great films. I absolutely loved it!<br /><br />It's fast pace keeps you captivated by this very personal story of 2 brothers fighting their dark pasts, one to forget, and the other to improve the lives of his family. Emotionally charged and incredibly exciting, this film is extremely easy to recommend.<br /><br />Added bonus: Nick Nolte deserves a great deal of respect for his supporting role performance.

B005FITIK0|4.0|Director Jason Reitman's previous pairing with screenwriter Diablo Cody on the film [[ASIN:B0019I6WDG Juno]] set the funny bar too high for this film to clear, but Cody's dramatic dialogue and Reitman's use of dry comedic delivery still punctuated this \\"my life is going nowhere\\" drama with leavening humor. It's not meant to be as funny and playful at Juno, so knowing that allows an audience to better appreciate what the film was meant to offer: plenty of us try to look at our lives through the prism of how we are doing now compared to who we dreamed we might be when we were younger. Some of us never let go of how others saw us in High School, and some of us go to great lengths to escape ever thinking of those hellish four years ever again.<br /><br />But what if someone never let go of being the IT girl in school? What if she began to rewrite reality to fit still being that IT girl years later? In that role Theron made believable what might have been out of reach for many other actresses: truly living in the dream world of the high school party days never ending, and the boy she loved is just a heartbeat away from leaving his child and happy marriage if that's what she asks.<br /><br />It's a film to help adults let go of the past, and empowers \\"Young Adults\\" to see that there is life after high school, and taking High School with you is more of a burden then a benefit.
B0042ADBGE|1.0|After the purchase i waited over 30 days for it to arrive. When it did i noticed it came from Italy, and the jacket cover was in Italian.  I slid the DVD into our system and it rejected it and said no disc.  I tried it in several other players withe the same result.There is no movie on the disc. So I'm out 20 bucks, and will never buy anything through Amazon again.
0812550706|5.0|I wish I had read this book when I was 10 years old, and still as an adult I may have enjoyed it all the more. It was a welcome break from more highbrow literary reading. The writing is solid and well paced, and by page 20 I already couldn't put it down. It's a fast paced novel about a young hero bravely pushing on against all odds it also offered moments of thought inspiring resolution for readers of all ages.<br /><br />It's genre is not limited to Sci-fi lovers. Much like the 2004 television series [[ASIN:B0036EH3U2 Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series [Blu-ray]]], and the 2009 films [[ASIN:B002T9H2ME Moon [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B002SJIO5E District 9 [Blu-ray]]], this is a story of a boy with very human problems that takes place in a sci-fi setting. He's constantly under attack and he's always pushing back with us as the readers cheering him on.<br /><br />For parents - It's a great story for teaching young people about how their age doesn't limit their potential. It's also validating to creative types who approach old problems in new ways. If you are a parent wanting to inspire your child to be brave under pressure and to have faith in their own ideas and intellectual abilities (or an adult struggling with the same issues), I recommend this book all the more.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have a kindle fire and I absolutely love this app. It loads fast and hasn't been wrong about a forecast yet
B004NO55EK|4.0|the book I purchased arrived within the timeframe that was noted upon placing the order and it was in good condition.  I would use this vendor again with upcoming purchases as they apply.

B005HSL626|5.0|The I pod version stinks(free)but this rocks. The Ipod version you cant do sensays swag (excuse my spelling)but over all good game.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a pretty good app although some games are definitely more fun than others.  The sushi game is pretty amusing and my daughter loves the urban skydiving one.
B0047S1KMS|5.0|My zombie bar is set high, but Dead Set far exceeded my expectations, especially for a television miniseries. A worldwide zombie outbreak has left the contestants on the UK Big Brother reality show oblivious to the horrors outside, and safe (for the moment) in their locked down \\"house\\" on a studio lot. Contestants consist of the cliched personalities typical of these shows: the dumb jock, the blonde Barbie, the sassy gay guy, the creepy outcast, etc. The series is a perfect blend of suspense, horror, and comedy. Yes, comedy. The scenes between the loathsome producer, Patrick, and Pippa, the unbelievably stupid Big Brother contestant, will have you laughing out loud.<br /><br />The survivors eventually need to make a decision: do they stay trapped in the house that is at least somewhat secure, despite the hungry zombies massing outside the studio gates, or do they make a run for it, not knowing where to go or how far the infestation has spread? Not surprisingly, the group has differing opinions, and a couple of idiotic moves with catastrophic consequences, forces their hands. As the outbreak catches up to our survivors, you will be rooting for some to escape, and hoping that others (Patrick and Pippa come to mind) become zombie food.<br /><br />As the zombie attacks started halfway through the first episode, I started to worry a bit that all of the dark lighting and quick edits were a sign of very cheap special effects. Not too worry though - things really picked up by episode 2 and stayed that way to the end, so stick with it!<br /><br />And speaking of the end....just WOW. It was absolute perfection.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love this app for the Kindle Fire. A wide selection of stations and audio sources at your fingertips. I particularly like the ability to select the quality of stream and the reliability rating the software assigns to individual streams. The suggested listening based on current selections is usually spot on.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great to pass the time! certain games give a lot of points so unlocking new games isn't hard. Lights Out grants many points with very little time investment.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love serphant and romeos plan there are sol many fun games and this is very addicting I'm glad I got this game
0307891372|5.0|These Prima game guides have been splendid for me on my last two Elder Scrolls games. i got one for oblivion and it helped me  find things that i know no human would find on their own without a bit of help. the map alone is worth but all the class info is very helpful too. Thanks Prima. i will always use you!
B004W4N55C|5.0|This is a very valuable tool. I can usually find what I'm looking for here. This was another app worth the money. I used to get online And go straight to this website, But now I can do this anywhere I want :)))
0802473156|5.0|This is the book I give to every engaged couple I know.  It is the wedding shower gift that gets the most talked about.  If you are not speaking your partners love language, no matter how much you try, he/she will not really feel the love.  This book tells you the love language of your partner and helps you figure out your own.  Be generous with our spouse - speak his/her love language often.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|product was shipped very fast, great price cheaper than any other place I checked and I did check quite a few. Product was packaged well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love that this has so many different games. I don't have to play the same games if I don't want to. Overall this is a great app.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I liked this movie from the opening soundtrack, \\"aint no love in the heart of the city...\\".  It is rare today to find a good legal drama that hit on all levels like this one does. It just might be because it wasn't written by a lawyer. tee hee hee.
0553386794|5.0|I first read this book 10 years ago, when I was in high school, and just finished it again in order to refresh my mind on the details to prepare myself to read through the whole series(I read books 2 and 3 although never read the later releases of books 4 and 5). I remember being enchanted with the book as a teenager and after the second read was blown away all over again. This was the series that made me dream of being a fantasy writer as a kid and inspired me to draft some short stories and sketch out some rough plot lines of my own. After trying to write a story (got through about 30 pages) I gained a whole new appreciation and respect for Martin particularly and those who pull off complex plot lines and character depth in general. It is partly discouraging and partly inspiring to try to hobby write in a genre when masters like this are out there. As I read, I feel as through Martin is describing a world that exists, rather than creating one and I suppose this is one mark of a true professional.<br /><br />Also, I wish the term \\"mummer's farce\\" (oft used in the books) had more traction in describing political gaming in the modern world. It says so much with so few words.
B005WGBQ9G|4.0|I am enjoying the break from all the gore of season 1, but like others have said the characters in season 2 seem to constantly be doing stupid things. What annoys me even more is the unresolved cliffhangers. For 6 episodes they have been looking for a lost girl. That is just too long. And then there's the man and his son from the very first episode. Why don't we find out what happened to them?
0061992860|5.0|This is an excellent book, it covers a wide variety of topics and is small enough to be carried in a cargo pocket or a butt pack. This is a must have for the camping enthusiest and outdoorsman. Bushcraft skills laid out in easy to follow instruction. Great for your B.O.B.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|As much as I like Tommy Lee Jones, this isn't the best vehicle for his talents. The plot line is typical: dry drunk cop barely in this side of the law (and ready to burst with rage at any moment) fends off bad guys and saves the women and children with unorthodox techniques. Sound familiar?
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible app has so many great features that it's hard to pick a favorite, but I'll start with this: you can switch to any popular English translation on the fly. You can download multiple translations to read offline or you can select a new one online. You can create notes for your own use or you can share them and you can access other reader's notes. There are numerous reading plans to choose from and you can choose to get daily reminders if you want.  My only complaint at present is that I don't see a way to change the font size. Other than that, I love it!
0143034901|5.0|I picked up this book after my friend loaned it to me.. and during a business trip I started to delve into Daniel's story, a story of love, betrayal, and mystery. Never have I been so inclined to write a review and make sure everything understood how amazing it was! Few books have the ability to master such a variety of emotions, and had me laughing outloud on the plane, and almost in tears during some of the most heart pounding passages I've ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone, and I'm so happy I stayed up nights, wondering what obstacle Daniel would encounter next.
B00004SAAX|5.0|I purchased simultaneously both this set of \\"Bach complete organ works\\" and [[ASIN:B0033KR5XY Bach: The Organ Works]]. I heard the latter first, and found my expectations far exceeded. It is simply exceptional, and entirely satisfying to me. I can't say enough good things about it.<br /><br />Walcha's is a very interesting contrast. This set is of great historical importance, without doubt, and worth owning for that reason alone. I find the playing very pleasing and rock solid, relative to rhythmic sense, phrasing, and general interpretation. Overall, it \\"feels\\" more like a tradition interpretation than does Preston, which is understandable. That's in no way a problem, though. The contrast is instructive. There are indeed multiple ways to walk up a mountain.<br /><br />Some of the recordings sound less aurally sharp than I'd have liked, but that's a minor point, and no problem at all once the music gets going. For the most part the recorded sound is very satisfying, and it's hard to believe, for example, that these recordings, made between 1959 and 1971, include some of the earliest stereo recordings ever made. The organs sound gorgeous. THIS surely is baroque organ as it ought to sound.<br /><br />The packaging is very good - sturdy, full and detailed documentation of the organs, the player, the recordings themselves, and so on. All in all this is a wonderful set to have, listen to, study, and be grateful for.
0763631205|5.0|I saw this book at a local bookstore and didn't grab it as soon as I saw and regretted it.  Upon returning they were sold out and were not getting anymore till the 1st of the year.  That didn't work for me since I wanted to book before Christmas.  I went straight to Amazon and not only found the book but at a lower price!  A Christmas Carol of a classic, of course, but not with the illustrations within this book.  Together the book is wonderfully magical.
0345528581|5.0|As a woman who makes her living sitting down, this book came as a pleasurable deviance from cult fitness and expensive gym fees. This is a great book [though filled with typos], but the app [Iphone or Android] is way better! Side note, I am a self proclaimed graduate of Tim Ferriss's [[ASIN:030746363X The 4-Hour Body: An Uncommon Guide to Rapid Fat-Loss, Incredible Sex, and Becoming Superhuman]]...needles to say, I wish I picked YAYOG up first.  The pros, in my case, are multiple:  - I gained strength from the inside out, not the outside in.  - Some body parts that never got attention started to get extremely powerful [like grip strength...who knew]?  - Instead of losing fat in spots, my whole body started to slim down uniformly.  The cons are multiple, as well:  - These movements are extremely hard for women and men alike, which can be discouraging.  - They are not cardio friendly; if you love the elliptical, or pounding the pavement, this is not for you.  - You do have to invest in some tools, like a pullup bar, and/or look for some places to do some of the work. You can always skip or modify.  I bought the phone app first [Android], then the book for further explanation. I added burpee ladders, as explained by Mike Rowe from Dirty Jobs, and never looked back. I invite women, and especially sedentary geeks prone to excuses, to pick this and the app up; a typical workout, for me, is 40 minutes: including warm up and cool down. Women might want to cross train with [[ASIN:B000SEW8EY Callanetics Classics 2 DVD Set]] to stay limber and men might want to invest in [[ASIN:0938045768 Convict Conditioning: How to Bust Free of All Weakness Using the Lost Secrets of Supreme Survival Strength]] to get more power.

B0063IH60K|5.0|Very smooth on the Kindle Fire, and the ads don't interfere at all.  I like playing Vegas style. Go get it!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a really great app...let's you highlight and make your own notes which is very convient. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it requires WIFI, which makes it almost impossible to use when out and about. But other than that, it works very well.
B005OTGS08|3.0|I'm a big fan of WWII movie, this movie is OK, won't watch 2nd time, it is more like from the movies of late 70'
B0054JZC6E|3.0|graphics are poor but the game is pretty fun to play I enjoy getting to the next level and gaining points
B004HAG40O|5.0|Best Album I've bought in years.  Can't say enough about the simple folk-rock arrangements and tight harmonies.  Tracks range from wistful and ethereal (January Hymn)to exuberantand poetic (June Hymn) to wierd and funny (Calamity Song).  Five Dollars for ten solid songs, not a dog among them, get the whole album, its a steal.
0374275637|5.0|This book has been a very insightful and interesting read. Stepping back and using this knowledge to take a look at my own life has been eye opening. Wonderful book that everyone should read.

068981528X|5.0|My son's favourite amongst dozens. The ages indicated are 5-9 but I find it's quite fine for a 3 year-old. It's a very refreshing take on a well-known tale, and one which can help (did for us!) dispel children's fear of the ever-present in fairy tales mean and scary wolf.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun but some games ok not good at but its a lot of fun. y'all should get it for sure
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Myself and my son are fans of this movie. We have a copy of it in DVD but when we saw in ammazon the blu-ray one we immediately bought it. The sound is really superb and to see it in blu-ray was really awesome. We watch it on weekends toghether and we love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty cool game wish unlocking was rosier though and didn't cost as many coin as some do. blab blab blah.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|I'm a fan of foxit for pc and use it all the time.  When I first purchased this app it did not work properly on the kindle fire, much like everyone else's reviews.  I sent them an email and receive a prompt response, although the problem was not resolved at that time (early December).  Just a couple of days ago, I received another email notifying me that they had fixed the bug related to the kindle fire and even provided me with the updated .apk file as a replacement.  Great customer service, especially for such an affordable product ($2.99 for android; free for pc).<br />  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the editing features for android were a little lacking, which is what I mainly purchased it for since the kindle fire is .pdf compatible.  Otherwise, a reliable product with excellent customer service.
B0007PAMEM|4.0|Considering that at the age of 69, Tina Turner put on 90 energetic shows during her 2008-2009 50th Anniversary Tour, you really need to see to believe how dynamic she was in her prime, by which I mean in her 40s and 50s. It was during those years that she sang and danced like a woman possessed (and looked fabulous doing it) thoughout the five massive stadium tours anthologized on this DVD: the Private Dancer Tour (4 tracks from 1985), the Foreign Affair Tour (1 from 1990), the What's Love Live Tour (3 from 1994), the Wildest Dreams Tour (8 from 1996), and the Twenty Four Seven Tour (5 from 2000). The latter included the misnamed \\"One Last Time\\" concert at London's Wembley Stadium, possibly Tina's best, most spectacular, and most indefatigable performance ever -- and she had just reached 60!<br /><br />Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee in 1991, recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 2005, and winner of eight Grammy Awards, Tina Turner is and will always be, as Rolling Stone magazine called her, the Queen of Rock & Roll. She never gave less than 100 percent during her career. This live video collection is indisputable evidence of her power over enraptured audiences, a joyful demonstration of her musical and theatrical craft, and one hell of a good time. Dedicated devotees will want to get the two-DVD, 43-track collector's edition of \\"Tina Turner Live in Amsterdam / One Last Time: Live in Concert\\" (1996 / 2000) so as to have complete shows, but for many casual fans, this disc will do. Below is a complete listing of the contents of \\"All the Best: The Live Collection.\\"<br /><br />1. Steamy Windows<br />2. Show Some Respect<br />3. I Can't Stand the Rain<br />4.

B003Y5H53S|5.0|This is not the best computer animated film I've seen but it is without a doubt the best animation I've seen. To briefly sum up the story, a chameleon embarks on a journey to find himself, winding up in the old west in a dry little town called dirt, dirt because it's bone dry because someone's siphoning its water away to the desert a la Chinatown, which this film makes parody of, among other classic films and themes.<br /><br />I think that what really makes this film fresh is that it's for grownups. The plot is very sophisticated, the references it makes to films like Chinatown and Apocalypse now are definitely films that most youngsters today aren't familiar with. The animals in the film, unlike most films animated in the west here, aren't cute and cuddly; they're ugly and often downright scary. Like many have pointed out here, this film was poorly--I mean POORLY--marketed. But when you think about it, when we Americans think of an animated feature we automatically assume it to be kid's stuff. Other cultures like Japanese have a more broader perspective when it comes to what's considered kids stuff, which probably explains why adults here lump anime in with \\"cartoons\\" that we make over here. Here's what I mean: recently, I recommended this film to a woman I know and asked her if she'd like to see it. Automatically, she said no and when I asked her why not her answer was that her 12 year old cousin saw it and didn't like it. What? I'd like to believe that as a man over 30 that my tastes would be a little more sophisticated, a little more substantial than that of a 12 year old. Go figure.<br /><br />Anyway, I really enjoyed this film. Saw it on the shelf at Blockbusters for months before I tried it, the cover didn't really look like much, hadn't heard anyone say anything about it. I am glad I rented it and later bought it. Adults may like it. Definitely not for kids imo.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|This book is just boring and terrible. It is like reading Quantum Leap meets Back to the Future. Why is there a helper named Al just like in Quantum Leap and like Sam Beckett falls in love with a woman he must leave to carry on with his mission.  Who cares anymore??? The first part of the book rambles on with saving a janitor. What does this have to do with Oswald???  Like Back to the Future, he goes to a dance. Where's Marty???  I am so disappointed in this book that I cannot wait to finish this story and move on to something better.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote daily to save articles I find while using my PC for reading later on the Kindle Fire. It's become my favorite app for clipping articles and storing notes and reminders. It works seemlessly across mobile and desktop devices.
B005LAIGMI|4.0|this is for you. Punches thrown by a woman who has done it for a living. Car chases w/o cgi. Bad people get their due, maybe not all, but that's for a sequel. A good solid old fashioned B-movie with good actors, director and intentions. That's more than you can usually expect these days. This is not a MI paced flic. It is slower, more real-life paced. But well worth the time.
B003L16FAE|5.0|I recently tried to watch my Predator DVD, circa 1997 (or thereabouts) and it looked horrible. It was a fullscreen, widescreen disc with black bars on top, bottom, left, and right (which insluts my HD TV). The film was also not cleaned before transfer so it included wonderful hairs and scratches too. That's not to mention the films always horrible fuzzyness.  Don't believe all the whiners, Predator: The Ultimate Hunter Edition is the best this film has ever looked, and probably ever will look. Some people complained about too much Digital Noise Reduction. They said that it doesn't look like its supposed to anymore...don't listen to them. I almost didn't buy this disc because of all the complaining people were doing, but I'm glad I did.  Yes, there are maybe 3 shots where Carl Weathers' face looks a little too smooth in the beginning of the film, but that comprises about 10 seconds of the film. The rest of it looks great. The film still has film grain, it just isn't as offensive as it was in the original release. Filmmakers on a budget and with location constraints chose a film stock that didn't need a lot of light, that meant super grainy film. They fixed that imperfection (which wasn't a design choice).  Bottom line, if you are a fan of this film BUY The Ultimate Hunter Edition, not the 2008 Blu Ray release.  P.S. Amazon, do you think you can stop cross contaminating your reviews. This movie's reviews are confusing because it includes reviews for every version of the film. Star Wars is even worse. Please fix this.

0439023513|5.0|I liked the first 2 books despite the cheesy \\"young adult fiction\\" motifs which were really just teenage girl fantasies similar to Twilight (2 handsome men vying for the young, awkward maiden's attention, every character is inexplicably obsessed with fashion and can't stop complementing how beautiful the main character looks, girl is oblivious to most of the attention, etc). The world, the games, and the characters are what kept me coming back, so it was a pleasant surprise for me to see the direction the author took the series with the third installment. It was a legitimately gritty book with everything you want in a war story: sacrifice, valor, grittiness, and gruesome deaths. The characters actually developed over the course of the story, even though I suspect they didn't go in the direction most of the young audience wanted. Labeling this book in particular as young fiction is misleading. This series was infinitely more adult than Harry Potter, for example. I certainly wouldn't want my kids reading about the various decapitations and incineration that take place. As for the ending, I for one enjoyed it a lot. It was a very realistic portrayal of how war affects relationships and left quite an impression on me. This book changed my opinion of the entire series because now I know the cheesier plot points actually come to a bittersweet conclusion. Katniss is no longer beautiful, she is in a relationship of necessity with a brain damaged boy while her handsome soul mate is partially responsible for her sister's death, and it is mainly business as usual in the Capitol with the exception of the Hunger Games. But still, there is hope. I'm glad the author didn't have a teenager saving the world. The way she ended it made the whole experience leave a much more lasting impression because we know it's right on the money.

B004K4IZ3G|1.0|This is a great DVD to buy if you want to watch previews, because apparently there's no way to skip them.  I recommend you rent this first, so you know what you're in for.  Then, when you discover you can't watch the movie you actually got the DVD to see, you can send it back without losing any money beyond what it cost to rent.  I don't understand what goes on in the heads of Disney executives who think that when consumers sit down to watch a movie, they first want to watch a lot of advertisements.  Especially when those advertisements come on every damn time they want to watch the movie.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This purchase of an HP12C Platinum from Amazon was to replace an earlier version that no longer functions. It is far superior than its predecessor.  It is much faster and the keys function properly without sticking. The addition of the Backspace and Undo functions are very welcome. I miss the days when HPs were made in the US and the keys were injection molded for a lifetime of use. My use of a financial calculator requires programmability and at least 20 storage registers. Incorporation of a second battery is assumed to be a plus. I highly recommend this version.

0525478817|4.0|John Green's book is an epic and realistic tale of love. It is really the most beautifully and tastefully written book that can make you laugh and cry at the same time. It has sharp, witty humour with loveable characters that take you on an emotional journey through the ups and unfortunately mostly downs of cancer. This has to be one of the best books from John Green and is well worth buying!

1400052181|4.0|Our book group picked several non-fiction books to read this year, and Rebecca Skloot's The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks attracted our attention because of the favorable reviews it's received, and because we felt curious about the production of human cell lines. The cover didn't inspire me once I got my copy of the book. Neither did the blurb. But a few chapters into the story I was hooked. It's a fascinating, thoroughly well-researched look at health, science and community, but it turns into a wonderfully human story once Henrietta's daughter Deborah comes on board.<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks was a poor black woman whose cancer cells, taken from her body during treatment, proved to the be the first human cells successfully grown outside the body. As a result, long after Henrietta was dead, her cells were instrumental in changing the face of modern medicine. But for years, Henrietta herself was unknown, and the medical care received by her family remained unreliable and unassured.<br /><br />At first I felt somewhat detached from this story. Having grown up in a world where healthcare is a human right, I found it hard to relate to demands that someone be paid for their mother's genes so they could afford their children's medication. I struggled with the idea that money might change hands for human cells, and couldn't relate to the concept of a living cell-line bestowing immortality. But Deborah struggles with these things too, then rises above poverty and lack of education to seek answers rather than jumping to conclusions. Adding friendship to enthusiasm, she recognizes beauty when she's finally introduced to the microscope, rejoices at what her mother's cells have allowed, and laughs delightedly at the (surprising) mischief they cause. Her human touch excuses and explains. Her vulnerability builds humanity. And her family becomes a group of real people with real concerns and needs and mysteries.<br /><br />Soon I've lost that feeling of being asked to take sides. All I want is to know more. The investigation gains a life of its own, almost as those curious cells have done, and the story's a delight to read, a personable, riveting depiction of race, ethics, medicine and big business, all viewed through the inverse microscope of a precious human life.<br /><br />Disclosure: I bought this book because our book club chose to read it, and I'm glad they made that choice..

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this app for the number of games available. the only thing I don't like is having to play games I don't care for to get to the better games. they have some good games that don't cost a lot of points but they also don't give a lot of points making you play the easier games a bunch just to unlock others.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is exactly as demonstrated in the product video.  I was looking for a nice low profile, lightweight case, and this one fills the bill.  Provides solid protection without the bulkiness of many of the cases.  Perfect for someone who travels extensively.

B001DSNEJM|5.0|Great Movie. Might start out a bit slow but as you catch on you will soon feel for Ben (Paul Walker) as he's in a position that challenges his sanity, knowing who he can trust and who's in on the plot.<br />I found the movie to be very different from others I've seen. The movie throughout stays pretty mysterious.<br />How one likes & rates this Movie is so very subjective to how one looks at life, how one understands Psychology and how one can relate. I've given it 5 Stars because it definitely captured me and gave me to think.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|I gave this to my 8-year-old nephew for Christmas and sat on the floor with him as he began putting it together.  I was able to stay while he put the dragon together.  The final product was a detailed and stunning bit of Lego artistry!<br /><br />Loved that each step in the building process has a matching bag of parts.  Helps tremendously to keep down the possibility of losing pieces by the end of the build.<br /><br />The directions were meticulous and my nephew worked patiently through each step.  Highly recommend this set for a kid who loves Legos and has the patience to see a project of this magnitude to the end.  The finished project(s) was a masterpiece!
B004XE0P5E|3.0|Washes of muddled romanticism that have more in common with the kitsch of Sigur Rós or Coldplay than the bard's vagueness would suggest.

B004C4IKCU|4.0|The 1960 album is considered to be one Elvis' very best studio albums, to stand proudly alongside From Elvis In Memphis and That's The Way It Is, etc. A great effort by all: artist, writers, arrangers, engineers. We all have our favorites among the diverse set.<br /><br />The 1961 album again showcased an engaged artist, though he is often drowned out by a discordant piano and two backing groups (correct me if I'm wrong). A more grandiose production...with some very stale tunes that Presley holds back on - taking the EIB approach, with stirring high notes from his chest, not so much from his throat, would have saved things like \\"Give Me The Right\\", Judy\\", and \\"Sentimental Me\\".<br /><br />The \\"hit singles\\" are pop music masterpieces - but what are they doing here? Most were done after March, 1961! Let me take it a step further: what the heck is SOMETHING FOR EVERYBODY doing here?<br /><br />I surmise the \\"Is Back\\" of \\"elvis is Back\\" surely covers that great 1960 to 1962 period when he expanded his audience..and really expanded his style of singing (note the wonderful soft ballads (\\"It's A Sin\\", \\"Starting Today\\", etc. sensitively sung by the 25-27 year old singer).<br /><br />I do not have a state of the art playback system but there's something about te remastered tracks which is less than satisfactory. A real re-MIX should have been the real deal here: then I could hear his majestic ending note on \\"There's Always Me\\" - what in the world was the dude at the mixing deck doing?<br /><br />As expected, great artwork and liner notes.

B006Y5BWQG|5.0|I have been a huge Marilyn fan for years and am so happy that something has been produced to help concrete Marilyn's stardom for new fans. After hearing about 'Smash' last fall, I've been anticipating the pilot and can now say it definately was worth the wait. It offers an insight into how a broadway show is put together while weaving in Marilyn-esque ora throughout the performances. I will surely be watching new episodes in the future.
B005OZ4EVW|3.0|Laura has a great voice but this is not one of her best materials, I was disappointing, I wish I can return the item. Next time I will try to listen more to samples before made a purchase. I love her voice but this is not the style of music of maybe I expect.  Laura tiene indiscutiblemente una gran voz. Este no es uno de sus mejores discos, tiene 3 canciones que valen la pena las demas son demasiado personales en mi opinion.  Creo que la proxima vez tratare de oir las canciones antes de hacer la compra de el disco entero. A veces las mas sonadas son las mejores y en este caso creo que es lo que han hecho, \\" bienvenido\\" es el mas sonado y por algo  las demas no valen la pena.
1451648537|5.0|The only down side of this book is the COLOR picture of the author. All other pictures are black & white.  Was the author trying draw attention to himself; rather then Steve ? I really do not care to read about the author,or see his picture; he is not important.  Would have enjoyed color pictures of  Job album.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game it is so addiicting too!!! wish I could play always and forever u know love it though play on!!!
B001L51RQE|5.0|Excellent! If you enjoy masterful musicianship this is a must see. Summers is magnificent on guitar, Sting is a virtuoso on bass and his voice sounds impeccable and Copeland is wondrous on the drums.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Having the digital copy of this movie is a HUGE plus! It was really easy to load onto my iPod and it is a life saver when we are stuck in a hospital office, in the car, wherever. I just hand my iPod to my son and he watches this movie. You NEED to have at least one movie on digital copy, it is a lifesaver with kids.  This is an excellent family movie. My 2 year old son and my wife both love it. There are not many movies out there we feel comfortable watching together. There is good music, lots of animals which Jude loves (Dogs and birds). Lots of laughs which his parents love.  I don't have a blue-ray player yet, but it's nice to have the blue-ray also so when I get one I will be able to test it out.  Great deal!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have and iphone and a kindle fire and a laptop, and I.have Evermore on all three. I love it because I can make a note or journal entry or anything and it syncs too all my devices. So if I make a note on my kindle and need to check it when I'm out, then I can just pull it up on my phone. Makes life a little easier, and isn't that what an woo is supposed to do :3
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden's Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son is the pinnicle of Maiden's creativity and technical profiecency. Davidson, Harris, Murray, Smith and McBrian are clearly at the top of their game. The first great song is Infinite Dreams, an epic and meanadering piece about the fine line between dreams and reality. Maidens exploration of these themes was well established at this point in their career. Can I Play With Madness has a killer drum beat by Nicko McBrian, his playing is precise and inspired much like Neil Peart from Rush. The Evil That Men Do has a great bass line from Steve Harris who is unquestionably one of the top 10 rock bassists of all-time. The title track is a long and well-crafted song similar to Rime Of The Ancient Mariner on Powerslave. The band later departed from such progressive masterworks and decided a slightly more commercial approach on subsequent albums. The Clairvoyant is another \\"hit\\" of the album, although Maiden has never officially been on the chart list. This album is a fitting end to Maiden's 1980's output, all of their albums are must haves from this decade and are surely their best work. Highly Recommended!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great. game love they way you play to get your coin to buy more games. recommends this game for every one
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Amazing story of the life of a man that would give anything for our country. I hope I can give as much to my country as he has.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Not only am I happy with the DVD I ordered but, considering it being the Christmas season, I received the DVD in record time. It was in perfect condition.
B0048IMZMG|5.0|This is actually an album worth buying. There are very few albums that have more than 3 songs worth buying. This is one of those albums. I was very impressed to learn that Taylor Swift actually wrote all the songs on this album. I don't know why they didn't let her do that to begin with because this is much better than he last album.<br /><br />Almost every song is really good.<br /><br />\\"Mine\\" is the best song on the album, it is a great love song about how a special someone is \\"the best thing that's ever been mine.\\"<br /><br />\\"Never Grow Up\\" would be the next best song. It will bring any parent to tears, it talks about how we shouldn't rush through life because many of the special moments like having little children are so short.<br /><br />\\"Sparks Fly,\\" \\"Mean,\\" and \\"Better than Revenge,\\" would be some other top notable songs.<br /><br />I bought it for $2.99 when it was an Amazon special. Very few albums to me are really worth $7.99, but if you are a big Taylor Swift fan, this one is worth it.
B005DC68NI|4.0|The author sets out what I've found to be a balanced view of self-publishing. He's included lots of helpful links for those starting out.<br /><br />I could have done without the 'success stories', but I know that many people will find them inspiring. And he has wisely chosen to focus on a broad range of self-publishers, and has avoided the very obvious super-stars.
B0002EXH54|5.0|Megadeth was a by-product of Dave Mustaine's agressive, vibrant, and destructive personality. He said that he left Metallica because when they got drunk they acted stupid, when he got drunk he became violent. Peace Sells...But Who's Buying? Was a slap in the face to his former bandmates. Megadeth created THE thrash metal masterpiece against which all others are judged. The bands playing is fierce and distilled, all bandmates are devestating on this album. Mustaines lyrics are direct and brutal, he is begging that you take him on, almost welcoming the melee that follows. This song reflected the eighties political climate in which it was written. In 1986, the world feared a nuclear showdown between the United States and the Soviet Union, this album is the culmination of those fears as well as a collective call to arms for freedom loving patriots. Not bad if ya want to get up for a game or exhausting workout either. They buzz around and envelope you with their ferocity, you get the feeling that your being consumed by this violent tornado of death and destruction. Recently, with albums like 2007's United Abominations, 2009's Endgame, and 2011's Thirteen, Megadeth has returned to form, with the assitance of great lead guitar playing by Chris Broderick, and pulverizing drumming by Glenn Drover. I feel the the last three efforts are far and away their best since Peace Sells. If you like agressive and brutal playing this is your Holy Grail.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety of games, but never get any updates. But on the kindle fire, you cannot get any free apps to earn free coins.
0446547654|4.0|Nicholas Sparks' new book, The Best of Me, is a great read!  Its main characters are Dawson Cole and Amanda Collier, former high school sweethearts. But they both come from different worlds, Dawson comes from a crime filled family, even though he tries to steer clear of the family buisness. Amanda comes from a family of wealth that has her path paved for her before she can even decide what she wants to do. After 2 and a half decades they are reunited by the death of the man, Tuck, that took Dawson in and helped their love to grow back when they were in high school. Throughout the twists and turns Tuck leaves for them in a series of 3 letters, Dawson and Amanda come to realize once again what they loved so much about each other.  As a freshman high school student, I found this book refreshing to read in the midst of drama and the craziness of everyday life. It is not a challenging novel to read but a very quick read. It engrosses you from the very beginning! The amazing journey Nicholas Sparks takes you on with this book is enchanting and a love story that any young girl dreams about, for the most part. Nicholas Sparks ingeniously plays the end into a way that is definitely not to be expected by any reader. You'll just have to read to find out!  I believe most, mature high school students would be able to read this book no problem. Clearly however, I think girls would like this book a lot more than the boys. Every person dreams of finding that one person that they fall irrevocably in love with and this book lifts your spirits and makes you believe that all our dreams can come true. I think people of all ages would love this book and tear through it as quickly as I did.  Nicholas Sparks once again does a great job creating a novel that can instantly top the best seller charts. The story of Dawson and Amanda is one that you always want to know more about and never want their time together to end.  This novel has an original taste to it, but still carries the classicalNicholas Sparks persona. I encourage everyone to read this book and to enjoy it just as I did.
B005NNVPOO|5.0|Love the remastered version of this album.  Sound quality is far better than the older versions I ripped from my CD years ago.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having so many versions of the Bible at my fingertips.  The reading plans are an easy way to start a regular reading routine.  I haven't missed one day since I downloaded this app.

B003B02OQ4|5.0|This one is still one of the best legal novels/thrillers I have ever read. I like how Grisham weaves the plot and twists it, and how he creates his characters and makes them alive. Page after page incresing intensity: what will happen to the client, and will the government win or the mob?<br /><br />I liked the movie version, too. It is not quite the same as the book, but it was very good, too.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is quite possibly the most overrated pile of horse manure i have ever seen. People say i don't get the movie, well that is not true. I understand the point of the movie it is just so long and boring. After all the rave reviews I kept waiting for it to get good and it never did. If you decide to watch this movie do yourself a favor and shut it off after you see Scarlett Johanssen in her underwear in the first minutes, its all downhill from there.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|The product is great... however the screen cover is not for the galaxy 2s (I do wish it had been the appropriate one)... so its a bit off in that respect but does exactly what it needs to do... and its gone through a few drops :)
B0053F042G|3.0|Wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it, but it probably isn't a movie that would get repeat viewings by me, like other favorites.
B004SBX112|5.0|i almost didnt get this due to the reviews. so let me clarify. you only see ads when you pause. they are not on the screen during game play and they don't interrupt your game play at all. you only see them when you pause and it's just stuff for rovio like angry birds merch or other angry birds games. still super fun and the themed levels are awesome.
0525478817|5.0|Great book, don't want to say too much and spoil it for people but it was an easy and intriguing read, it took me five hrs to get through. Sad that it's over though. And also I found so many quotes that I liked. This book will make you feel every emotion possible. One minute you're like ahh then you're like ughhh then aww then out of nowhere haha. It was amazing. I love John Green and his awesome talent for writing exceptional books.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I find myself coming back to this game over and over.  Goals seem a little high to achieve but doesn't stop me from playing.
0307593312|2.0|The core of this story is intriguing, but the ending is disappointing with no explanation of anything that made it intriguing.  That in it self would have earned 4 stars, but it lost another because the great majority of this story is completely mundane. What they wear, what they eat, how they walk, what they like, their history, their family's history, their friends' history, their friends' pets histories.  Even then, it would not have been so bad but then every other chapter is a reflection of prior events. Whether it's the character reflecting on it, or telling it to someone else, or another character reflecting on the same thing, or yet another character reflecting on the same thing. And this happens several times over. Basically anytime any character reflects, and they do often, it will be narrated in almost its entirety. And on top of THAT, they introduce yet another character's perspective as he tries to figure out everything that has already happened in the first 2/3rd of the story, and you get everything regurgitated to you all over again. So that cost it another star.  I would say there may have been 5-6 chapters that were integral to the actual plot out of the 50+ chapters. The rest are reflection on those chapters or reflecting on reflections or chapters that doesn't lead anywhere. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe there is in fact a lot of symbolisms or some other redeeming factor at play that I outright missed. But don't expect this to be a page turner unless you're ok with turning 30 to 60 pages for every morsel of intrigue.  Why did it earn 2 stars? Well the second fourth of the book was interesting. After 100 pages of Aomame getting out of a taxi and walking down an escape staircase to get out of a traffic jam and another 100 pages of Tengo telling his editor how interesting this other story is, a lot of interesting unknowns are introduced. It was at this point that I thought I would end up liking this story and hence the two stars. Then nothing happens for along time. The crux of the story occurs (interesting!). Then nothing happens for a long time afterwards while repeating the interesting unknowns ad nauseum. Then the two protagonists meet and resolves their trouble without much (or any) conflict. The end. Insert 200 pages of monotony in between and you get a 900+ page novel.
1439138311|4.0|Maybe it's because the subject is so close to my heart (I too moved to Brooklyn from far away and lived in the neighborhood where most of the book takes place), but I found myself incredibly engrossed in the story and moved by its characters. The emotions the main character, Eilis, feels after leaving behind the family she loves in Ireland and entering an unknown country are very realistic and presented so earnestly. Most of her actions and thoughts are very subtle and do not necessarily reveal everything to the reader. This allows for exciting storytelling, as the audience never quite knows what the character will decide to do when she is torn between her new life and her old.  Sometimes the book was a bit frustrating, from the occasional unlikely character response or slightly contrived event, but in general it was such a great read. The story moves along at a quick pace and the author is amazing at detailing the scenery and era in which the story takes place.
B005NPBT5M|5.0|Excellent remastering and sound quality of a classic album.  I love getting to upgrade my Pink Floyd catalog with higher quality versions.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Simple to learn, yet can get extremely challenging. Who knew that getting a piece of candy to a little green blob could be so fun? A cutesy physics-based game with the heart of a Rubic's Cube built in. just when you get used to wrapping your brain around one concept, they introduce another... such as spiders that crawl along your string and steal your candy, little puffers that'll blow your candy around, magic hats that transport your candy through space and even boxes that seem impossible. A great little game that's well worth the money.
0525421580|5.0|This book is good, at first one of the Will Graysons was annoying with all his complaining, depression, hating life and what not but I got to see how he grew and changed. And that's what I liked how throughout the whole book he changed, it might not have been quick but he changed for the better with the help of the other Will Grayson. This Will Grayson also had his faults but he also came to realize that he needed to change. I really liked how they both came together in the end to make a friend feel better in an amazing/awesome way. This book is a good read and it is recommended if you have not read it yet. :) My favorite line, paraphrasing of course, The best part is the floating.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved this book and my only complaint is that it was not nearly long enough. I was totally immersed after just the first two chapters and a book I could easily read over and over again. It is so well written you almost have to shake your head to clear it back to our reality after being so submerged into this other world.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The ads really aren't that bad. I love the fact that the short games are so varied. If you are capable of ignoring ads and like simple, casual games, check it out.
0439023521|4.0|To frame all of my comments; I confess that I read this book in nearly a single sitting. I read chapter one a few days earlier, then when I picked it back up, I ended up reading for about eight hours until I had finished the book. So no matter what else I say about it, Hunger Games was a riveting read. Somehow I thought of it simultaneously as a fun read, and felt a sense of horror which kept me going.  As for my insignificant critiques: I didn't care for the writing style. I'm not a fan of first person usually, and there were a couple instances it became distracting, but usually it was only because I suddenly realized I was reading first person when I had been totally absorbed for the last 50+ pages. So, while it took me a while to get into it because of the style, once I got into the story (which didn't take long) I let that pass me by and enjoyed the story.  My only other thought about the book, other than the fact that I'm looking forward to reading the second, is that I'm not sure how I feel about the uniqueness of the plot. That is, after taking a step back, I can see the plot as a redone Tunnel In The Sky (Heinlein) along with various other survival sci-fi stories. At the same time, I enjoyed it thoroughly, and only afterward can I look at the story and find similarities to other stories. I truly enjoyed the book, so in the end, any similarities don't really bother me. To me, no story is left untold, but there is always a new way of telling them.  In the end, I give Hunger Games 4 of 5, though if I could I'd give it more like 4.5. I don't think it's the most amazing book ever, and I doubt I'll reread it, but I downright enjoyed it and don't have any complaints about staying up half the night to read it.
B004GYOQ6A|3.0|This game is entertaining for a short period of time but I ultimately deleted it because it quickly got boring.  Fun while it lasted though.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it has clever play, great puzzles, nice graphics.  this game is very addicting.  can't wait to see more games like this.
0142414999|5.0|I thought it was going to be weird reading it being by three different authors, but it flowed and it was an easy read. It was good, although its not first book I've read that was written by multiple authors, but it was structured different than the first one I read. The first collaboration book I read was Dash and Lily's Book of Dares, that was only two authors, Rachel Cohn and David Levithan, but they alternated on the chapters they wrote. And that's how this one was different, first Maureen Johnson wrote a short story, then John Green and finally Lauren Myracle, despite the separation of the stories I liked how they were begun and ended and in the end they all came together. And it was interesting reading the different stories through different point of views.

0307891372|3.0|This guide looks fanstastic, but that is where the good things stop. The index is incomplete, with many key elements missing. You'll have a very hard time finding what you need. It's a lot easier to go to wiki or You tube and find what your need.  I am disappointed.....
0375758992|5.0|This book takes one to a time and place that most have never, and will never, experience. Told in lyrical language, in a matter of fact style, the author describes a horrifying and wonderful childhood all in one package. At the end of the book one really understands the magic of Africa for white settlers.
0525478817|5.0|(Spoiler free!)  As a nerdfighter, I was pretty much set to buy any book John Green writes. I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary, just a good book to read in bed. And the very little I'd heard of the storyline promised tears, which I did not want at all. I could not have been more wrong. This book is just as funny as it is heartbreaking, just as silly as it is genius. I've never been more surprised by a book in my life. I'm 23 years old, and I honestly thought I was getting too old for YA. I started craving books with more substance, with protagonists my age or older, feeling I could no longer relate to teens and their teen drama. I can't tell you how foolish that was! This is not a teen story, this is a HUMAN story. With equal weight and value given to every single character- from the adults, to the amazingly vivid 16 year old girl who narrates the story.  I can't recommend this book enough. You have so very much to gain.  Thanks for reading!
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Madonna once again did not dissappoint with this tour from Into The Groove to Get Stupid thi tour is great. There was not a single moment that I was bored during this show in Argentina. I love Madonna and can't wait for the next CD and tour to come so that I can go see it.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|Can't say enough about how much our entire family loves watching this movie over and over again. It's hilarious, action packed, has great dialogue and an awesome ensemble cast. But the most interesting thing about the Blu-Ray edition is listening to the ex-CIA agent's commentary about how the movie compares to the real world. There are some juicy tidbits included in there. Last but not least, I was going to say how I love Karl Urban, Bruce Willis and Mary-Louise Parker, but just adore the other main actors, too, so cannot leave out Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Helen Mirren, Brian Cox, and a wonderful cameo by Ernest Borgnine.
B0059XTTXC|5.0|\\"IT'S EXPERTLY ACTED BUT IT'S DULL.\\"- That's a pretty convenient out for the negative reviews here, and I'm not a contrarian, but I wanted to give my take. This is a great film, not for the easily confused, and not for the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE crowd either. It's the most labyrinthine film I've seen in YEARS. It is confusing and I felt that some of the characters weren't quite as fleshed out as I would have liked, particularly Ciaran Hinds, but it's a wonderfully stylish and quiet spy thriller packed from beginning to end with top-notch performances, particularly from Oldman as well as a surprisingly strong performance from Mark Strong. I've seen him in a number of films but never been truly impressed. Relegated to playing the heavy in films like the first Downey SHERLOCK HOLMES to KICK-ASS to GREEN LANTERN, I felt like I was missing something that so many others had seen. In TTSS, I finally got it. Also, Tom Hardy and Benedict Cumberbatch do excellent work as well.<br /><br />Honestly, I have not read the book, but I took my father, an avid Le Carre fan and lover of the \\"Smiley\\" books, and not only did he really enjoy it, but he also remarked that it held up quite well with the source material.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I bought this video to share with my grandchildren.  After my purchase, I was thrilled to be able to see it on my computer while I waited for delivery.  My grandsons and I watched it first on my computer and again when I received the DVD in the mail.  I remember watching this movie with my children, and, now, seeing it again with my grandchildren was just as enjoyable.  The dinner scene with the Day O song was just as hysterical today as it was 20 years ago!
B004GYY714|5.0|This is the best free app I have gotten.Works great.I haven't any buffering issues.Can browse web,read book,or whatever else while listening to your favorite stations!!!
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I'm rating this 1 star not because of the quality of these excellent books, its because these merchants are taking advantage of us by charging more for the electronic version than for the actual paper books.  If I spend $25, the paper books come free.  So I can get actual books shipped to me cheaper than I can download the electronic version.  I understand that things are changing but I don't understand why there is this disparity in pricing.
0307719774|5.0|I've had this for about 2 weeks now and it's been so fun! I like to journal, but in the past it's been sporadic, this gives me something small to think about and write everyday, it makes it lots of fun

B00440DRVQ|5.0|This is my second pair of Brooks running shoes and I can't be happier. I log about 20 miles a week and I'm 5'10\\" 175 lbs. My feet tend to pronate, but the GTS 11 shoe is like a dream to run in. I would recommend this to anybody looking for a solid running shoe.
B004GYY714|5.0|The product information says it all.  After loading the app, I played with it awhile.  Very impressive!  Loads of stations to choose from, very clear audio, and super easy to use.  I'm very surprised they didn't put a price on it.
0439023491|4.0|The book was the most dissapointing out of the trilogy. I guess it would be pretty hard to top the last one, though!
B00006GA48|5.0|Great album of that time.  Always will be.  You can't beat this 3 man band !  I have listened to them since I was a kid and have been to several of their shows.
B004FOA84A|3.0|I enjoyed playing the game and figuring out the little puzzles, but it was over way too quickly especially for a paid app. I have uninstalled, but will keep on my app list in case there's a chance for more puzzles.
0812992792|5.0|This book presents an imaginative peak at life inside the North, which might be one of the most interesting places left on earth.  One of the great events that happened there about a year ago, was hardly noticed here.  The Dear Leader discerned that people had made too much money in their market trading activities of produce and goods and so overnight devalued the currency from 10 to 1.  That is the kind of prison camp the country is, run by the lowest criminals on the face of the earth.  It is very much about the year 700 there.
B004ZN9YNC|1.0|This album is a debacle - its not even worthy of the Pink Floyd name.  I have never recognized this album as Pink Floyd. Its a Roger Waters solo album.  Period.  The proper name for this album is \\"Roger Waters - The Final Cut (with special guests David Gilmour and Nick Mason)\\"  Because its labeled as PINK FLOYD, that pisses me off.  The band isn't even existing at this point - Roger kicked out Rick Wright after The Wall, and Roger, David and Nick recorded this album in separate studios.  Thats not a band, its a charade.  And there are WAAAAYYYY too many orchestral parts, and the saxophones don't do it justice either.  Its evident that Roger was an ego maniac and wanted the Pink Floyd name to himself.  The lyrics are very self-indulgent and the music itself is a lot like stuff that was recorded for The Wall, but not used.  Its VERY evident on \\"The Hero's Return\\".  If you can't hear it, then your obviously not listening and in complete denial.
0143038419|4.0|This book did a very good job of getting me \\"hooked\\" into the plot. I felt like I was living her life with her! I did find it a little preachy and I think too much value is placed on a woman being in a relationship to be happy. I know not everyone got that out of this book though.
B000002A46|5.0|Lost my original  so........ Very Happy !! Xmas wouldn't be the same !! Thank you Thank you  Thank you !!!
0684857219|5.0|Nice book, I love it! I think that it's very good not only for bodybuilding fans, but for everyone who wants to know more about this sport.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the convenience, reading plans, alerts and everything else it comes with to utilize. I always recommend it to everyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! I'be used the online, blackberry &amp; Aneroid phone version for a long time. Now I use on the Kindle Fire. Love the reading plans, social connectivity &amp; audio compliment. I use it for daily reading, study, research &amp; even preaching. Rarely lug my actual Bible to church or meetings.<br /><br />Only issue is not with the app, but Amazon's lack of timely updates to the store. Takes several days to provide an update after it hits Android Market.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love accessing my computer from my tab and my phone.  Also great for monitoring my childrens usage.  Will use this for a long time to come.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|pretty good game. play it and you will like it i did and my kids .good way to wait for our wives shopping.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game was awesome you should get it there are so.many games that you could get but none of them compare to this!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this App. One of the first ones I downloaded for my iPhone years ago. So glad to now have it on my Kindle Fire as well. Always great updates. Absolutely LOVE the reading plans offered, highlighting, translation choices..everything!! Seemless UI. Best Bible App available, no contest. Would never use anything else. Enjoy this daily &amp; keep the faith. :)
B001TH16DS|5.0|As a life long Star Trek fan I was glad that they put this show out on blu ray. They even give you the option of the updated special effects. Season one really changed society and tv as well. Many of the ideas of this show inspired real scientists too. It's a classic show and well worth owning.  The blu ray picture was loveningly cleaned up and the show has never sounded or looked better. Sadly the movies on blu ray are just didn't get this treatment. Noone can explain why either.  Still grab this blu ray set if you love this show because it has never been better presented than here.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|as long as you have wifi this Bible app is great! you can compare different versions and pick your favorite to read whenever you are online
B0013FFMOK|5.0|This is an excellent movie and I got it at an even better price.  Definitely worth owning and viewing again.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|This is not an accurate reflection of the legal system. What it is though, is an entertaining movie that highlights one man's ethical dilemmas and what he does to overcome them. So do not get this movie because you think you are watching something that reflects the legal system. Rather, just get it for some good acting and a good movie.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|pretty good but some of the games don't have instructions and it is hard to figure out what to do
B005XQLBU4|5.0|The game is fun to play and its easy to squeeze a game or two in while waiting for something.
B004W48QFG|5.0|My workplace has strict firewall restrictions and I can't connect to my PC there by any means except Remote Desktop.  It also uses a weird gateway.  I originally downloaded one of the free Remote Desktop apps, which worked fine connecting to my PC at home, but I couldn't get it to go through the gateway at the office.  So I bit the bullet and paid for this app.  Setup was easy and I got through to my work PC on the first try.  Navigation was a little awkward at first, but the help available in the app menu provides the exact information needed.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|This is a great movie, with a great music which makes you believe you fly with them in these wonderful places!  I will start learning snowboard right now!!!
B004LWZVZC|2.0|This movie was created with an ulterior motive in mind, and I would argue that the motive rested in trying to reflect how military tribunals are never worthy of the American values Redford supports. The way in which the trial was presented reflected too much of today's procedures, but not as much of what actually happened in the past. This does not make it fatally flawed, rather too ambitious. However, that was not what made this a bad experience for me. Rather what was the problem rested in the fact that the dialogue was far too slow, as well as the entire movie.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This has to be one of the best games I have played on my Kindle Fire. It is a really fun and really addicting game and I hope they continue to make more levels for this game. Everyone needs to play this game.
B000A0GXGA|2.0|Wish I would have read the reviews before I bought.  This product is not worth the price!  Three shows only; sold by a thrid party. It was a gift so I did not send it back, but certainly fell into the \\"P.T. Barnum\\" category...one born every minute-that was me with this purchase.
B002RI9M2U|3.0|What would you do if you were mailed a bunch of casette tapes from a girl you knew from school who killed herself, blaming you as one of the 13 reasons for her sucide?  That's just what Clay Jensen has to deal with when he opens a package containing 7 tapes labelled 1-13 in nail varnish.A schoolmate and old crush of his,Hannah Baker, soon tells him what her last thoughts were via walkman.  First of all,I didn't expect to give this book three stars out of five cause it had a neat concept and curiousity soon got the better of me ,so I thought&#34;what the hell,what's gonna be so unlikeable about this book anyway?&#34;  In one word-Hannah.I tried to like her,especially when she tried to befriend a popular girl called Courtney ,cos still being in high school and about Hannah's age,I could pretty much relate to Courtney's unintentional actions towards Hannah, and Hannah being let down by it.  But all your reasons were ricdicolous,Hannah!No reason at all to kill yourself.You could have done what many other people do when they are treated like crap-dust yourself off and try to forget about it at least!Those popular  kids were never worth your time,my friend.  When we finally got to Clay's part of the book, where we find out what he did to upset Hannah,I half suspected that since he is the sweet, typically nice guy of our book, that he would be the one who didn't derserve to be on the list(not that the other people did anything major to Hannah in the first place).I know it might sound a little harsh coming from a high school girl who went through alot of the same stuff that Hannah went through but getting your name put on a list saying that you had a nice ass-a little too dumb a reason for killing yourself,I'd say.  I know that Jay Asher has never been a teen girl in high school,but I' m giving this book three stars instead of the one it deserves cos Asher did a good job with Clay's part of the book.He made it  alot more interesting than Hannah's part in my opinion, cos Clay came across as more sweet and likeable than Hannah did.  I was also confused that even though Hannah admits that her decision to kill herself was her own decision,she still blamed people for hurtful,yet small things.Not once did she blame herself... and Clay agreed with her for all of the book!!!Like I said earlier,it got more and more harder to feel sorry for Hannah and I never got why Clay liked her so much.  Sorry if you have finally made it this far through this long,boring review andfind it pointless, but I had a lot of issues with this book that I needed to get off my chest.In short-a decent book about snowballing problems,but not one of my faves!!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are so many different choices that this app is fun for all ages! the sushi. game is by far the best
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|Sergeant York is one of my all time favorite movies.  Over the years, I watched this movie many times on regular tv.  During the VHS tape era, I bought a copy in that format.  Now that we're well into the DVD era, it was time to upgrade.  With this movie, there are 2 items of note:<br /><br />1) Product quality - for what is now a 70 year old movie, the qualtiy of this video is perfect.  TV played this movie in B&W and a poor colorized version.  This DVD is in B&W just as it was filmed.<br /><br />2) Movie rating - Really?  This is one of the greatest war movies of all times depicting the early years of Alvin York, recipient of the Congressional Medal of Honor.  If you haven't seen the movie, what are you waiting for?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is a really fun game. Throwing the birds at the cages and the evil monkeys is fun. Everyone should play this game.
4770031246|5.0|I was anxiously awaiting this to come in the mail, and I have to say I am not disappointed! The recipes are fun and delicious and she gives plenty of alternatives to the main courses. Her advice is practical, friendly and fun.  I find myself partial to the cutesy bentos, but they can easily be made more simplistic. For my husband, I make them a little more sleek, and slightly less adorable.  Also, its wonderful that you can use these recipes for actual separate meals, though it helps that often she includes recipes for single servings.  This book is fantastic, I love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|All my grandchildren enjoy playing, even the 18 month old.It's funny to watch. We all play together and alone! Love it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun!!! I love all the games on here great fun for anyone to enjoy !!!!!! happy playing!!!!!
B001QWBM62|5.0|This item is used extensively in a DSLR video shooting function, as well as for ambient field recording. Dual XLR with phantom power and the 4-track recording function are the main selling points for me. The built-in condensor mics are quite sensitive and have a good response. Low-cut filters (various settings), full manual level inputs, etc. are nice. Originally was not happy that there was not a dedicated 3.5mm line input jack, but line-input signal can be fed thru the 1/4\\" jack inputs. I believe there was a problem handling line level input though originally, but a firmware fix enables this well (the recording levels will now go below the \\"1\\" setting in the high input signal use). A seperate 3.5mm input jack for line level input would be welcomed however. A firmware fix also enables seperate channel recording levels.<br />I'd personally rather have a nice traditional pot for the manual recording level as it seems easier to use in the field, and is smoother for fading in/out, but doesnt really matter as that can be done easily in post, but still think a nice pot is easier to use.<br />Like that it uses readily-available AA batteries, but it can eat them pretty fast (esp. if using phantom power, etc). I use several pairs of eneloop rechargeables to switch out with. The LED display seems dated and could be upgraded in a future model, as well as the start-up time, maybe even make the form factor slightly smaller.<br />But the recorder is very functional and does a great job with high-quality field audio, and the price is quite reasonable for the features/quality.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Hot hot hot, I loved reading 'Fifty Shades Freed'. It was everything I could ask for in a book, hot, exciting, loving, and funny. I am sad that the series is over but I felt that it ended perfectly. I was also happy to read the extra's at the end of the book from Fifty Shades of Grey' from Christian point of veiw. I loved reading what he was thinking while Anastasia was interviewing him. I hope we see more of Christian point of veiw either in a book or something. I love this series and will be looking forward to whatever EL James comes out with next.
1466284862|5.0|This novel is unforgetable, beautiful, deep, insightful, full of wisdom  and thought provoking. It is an artistic masterpiece. For those who love  to enter into a consciousness of earlier times and inhabit worlds that  preceded our own, this book is a revelation, and a gift.

0439023521|1.0|I teach primary aged children and I have a teenage daughter.  So when I learned that a book about children killing each other on national television was all the rage, I was disgusted.  I was even more disappointed when I found out that my daughter had read it at school, and liked it.  Obviously, there are a lot of kids who like this book, and we all know that as long as the publishers are making money, more books like this will be written.  I work with children all day, and I know that they will be affected by the message that these types of stories tell.  Why will we be surprised when children start killing each other in the news?  Sad.  More than sad.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|LOVE this app! amazing plans to follow, daily remjnders, &amp; tons of translations. highly highly recommend! great ways to quickly reference favorite passages
B0053JJLLC|4.0|MICRO is a fun and exciting read, nothing more and nothing less. Its plot isn't a bit more outrageous than that of Jurassic Park. I enjoyed it and will probably read it again someday.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|I have read a couple of one-star reviews for this album and I couldn't quite understand what had upset these noble reviewers so much. That's true that I am not, and haven't been a fan of PT, so I can't compare The Incident to their earlier albums ... in fact, I only discovered PT for myself a few weeks ago.<br /><br />Anyway, this double LP is simply excellent(I am convinced that Porcupine Tree is a kind of a band that is best when played on a vinyl record). I certainly do not find any irritating flaws on it.<br /><br />It's one of those meaningful, yet enjoyable \\"concept albums\\" that the musicians don't seem to be producing too often. It's monumental and sophisticated alright, but without being heaped-up, pompous or overbearing.<br /><br />Hope this helps ... I don't know how to write witty reviews, but - once again - The Incident is great.
B004HO6I2E|1.0|i ordered the unrated version on here. got sent the regular version, no unrated option anywhere on the dvd. so, i am upset that i did not get the one advertised and the unrated version i specifically ordered. it remains to be seen what can be done to correct this. i will be looking into it. a person should get what they pay good money for. not happy. UPDATE: THEY FIXED THE PROBLEM VERY NICELY. GOT A REFUND, AND GOT THE RIGHT ONE LATER ON. tHIS MOVIE IS FOR PEOPLE WHO REALLY HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF HUMOR. IF U DON'T HAVE A STRONG SENSE OF HUMOR, U MIGHT FIND THIS MOVIE OFFENSIVE OR NOT FUNNY. BUT IT IS ONE OF THE FUNNIEST MOVIES I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG LONG TIME. GET IT.....if u wanna crack up, that is.

B005WM6RUS|5.0|Sarah's Key, by Tatiana de Rosney, takes place in two different periods, 1942 and the present. In July 1942, the Vel' d Hiv, a large roundup of Jews that were eventually sent to their death, took place in Nazi occupied Paris. The story flashes forward to the present because of a connection to the past. The French police, who abandoned the French Jews to their sad fate, committed great atrocities.<br />  Julia Jarmond is an American working in Paris as a journalist. Her magazine is for Americans living in France. She is researching the Vel' d Hiv round up, this connects her to Sarah and her story. Sarah Starzynski, a ten-year-old girl and French Jew, living in Paris is rounded up in 1942 and eventually taken to a concentration camp. Sarah and Julia share the same century, but very different lives.<br />  The Vel' d Hiv was a large roundup of Jews during 1942; families were taken from Paris and eventually sent to concentration camps and to their death. The book Sarah's Key tells the sad story of Sarah Starzynski and her life after the tragic events of the Vel' d Hiv. Her younger brother Michel's fate affects her life and decisions greatly. Sarah's story is intertwined with Julia Jarmonds' story and her busy life. Sarah's story turns Julia's life upside down. It affects her marriage, work, family, and life as a whole.<br />  Sarah's Key is a wonderful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat to the very last page. It is a magnificent portrait of two different time periods that are very different and yet share many connections. It will make you cry and realize what is truly important. It is a story of a tragic history that will never die. Sarah's key is a remarkable novel that will stay with you long after you've finished reading it.

0441013597|5.0|I do not like the rest of the Dune series as much as this book but having said that, this is the only book in my library that I pick up every once in a while a read all over again. It is that good. If you feel mired in this mundane world of wages and bills, this book is for you. The Dune universe is at once bizarre in the extreme but very familiar insofar as its a very human story.<br /><br /> I believe that as innately religious creatures, humans are drawn to stories such as this where the main character eschews his/her animal nature and embraces their spiritual side. Paul is a god-like character because of the human spirit within and it reminds us all of what lies inside within us.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|Could not this movie anywhere, especially on Blu-Ray. I was searching for it for the Holidays and found it here. Arrived in perfect condition and before it was promised.
0066620996|4.0|A must for people starting businesses and already in business...valuable lessons learned. I would recommend for instructors teaching entrepreneurship and for corporate training modules
B001F7MSFM|3.0|Love the movie - it's the DVD I'm not crazy about! It plays in Fullscreen, not Widescreen, although Amazon AND the DVD case say that it's in Widescreen (letterbox.) I can't find anything on the disc's menu that allows you to change the format. It's not my equipment - all my other Widescreen DVDs play in Widescreen with no problems using my DVD player and TV set. I'm puzzled that both the Hellboy movies' DVDs that I bought here on Amazon say Widescreen, but play in Fullscreen.
B005IZLPMY|5.0|As a marvel comics fan, the origin of the avengers was absolutely delightful. The film was excellent in pointing out the qualities that made up Captain America. The only issue was it used a major character from another marvel film. The movie used Chris Evans who was the human Torch in the \\"Fantastic 4\\"
B004MC8CA2|4.0|love this app.  lots of versions and easy to use.  wish it didn't always require wireless connection so I could use it everywhere
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs are hilarious in 2 Broke Girls. Comic Gold. I definitely will be buying the first season when it comes out.
B001AK3S4Y|3.0|The movie itself is great- my problem is with the actual DVD. The description of this DVD on Amazon's website says that it's Widescreen, but it's not. It plays Fullscreen in my DVD player, and I cannot find anything on the DVD menu that allows you to change the format. All my other Widescreen DVDs play in Widescreen (aka letterbox) with no problem, using the same DVD player and TV set. I'm not happy.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|The movie was filled with action which held a few surprising twists. It was very entertaining even though the battle over gold and planetary seemed a little far-fetched.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fantastic game play with easy to use controls. the animation is smooth. I'd recommend this version because it doesn't freeze.
B004EPZ06G|5.0|I watched the first one and wasn't really a fan. But this one was just enough funny. A must see! Don't take my word for it, watch it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so awesome lots of mini games that are a lot of fun challenging but fun highly recommend
B004EPZ07U|4.0|The film was nice - another DC Comic answer to many Marvel Comics movies. This movie answered the one of two origin stories of the Green Lantern, and it was very entertaining.
B0029LHW68|5.0|This album is awsome, i need to say one thing, that some of the songs were a little bit of a bubble gummish sounding, the record company is making them record stuff that is from somebodys else compossing, the band needs to go back to the heavyier sound like the first two albums, but this is my two cents worth, I love the group and there songs, but I can hear the difference between Jared leto and his brothers compossing; compaird to the record companys contract, But Hey still Buy this Album because a real (30 Seconds to mars Fan) Will ALLWAYS BUY Anything the band will put out there for us FANS And All die hard Fans that are MENTALY DEVOTED to this Band; Is to buy any Album that they shall produce for us to listen to.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app! It runs a little slow on 3g but still allows full access to PC remotely on my HTC EVO 4g,  works fast on 4G and wifi. I was able to run quickbooks and email the invoice from 45 miles away on 3G.  the next day needed an address from an email on my PC and on 4G switched programs to outlook, opened the email and read the info I needed 60 miles from home.  Can't beat that for a $5.00 one time fee.
0465043577|5.0|This book is both entertaining and instructive. It is also a more approachable text for those who don't have the background to enjoy his collection of papers published in \\"Fractals and Scaling in Finance\\".<br /><br />It is instructive because a good part of the text is a very generalized presentation of the math theories used in Finance to model the market. Most of the Finance books present the math without a complete analysis. Mandelbrot does an excellent job instructing the reader about the theories and how they are applied to market models. And he presents the flaws which exist. You may not agree with his overall thesis, however, it is still very instructive.<br /><br />People may not agree with his point of view, but his research from the 1960's  is interesting and still relevent today.<br /><br />As far as his assertions, I personally agree with him, and so does a large part of wall street. Random walk is not employed by traders, and the market makes most of its major moves in very short discrete periods of time. And Wall Street employs alot of math types to develop trading models to exploit patterns. Of course the patterns change as more systems exploit the pattern.<br /><br />The flaws in modern finance theories are more based on the fact that there are standardized methods like the CAPM, which become worthless once everyone is forced to employ them.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|Easy and addicting!!!  Skill level is enough for an adequate challenge.  Very enjoyable effortless entertainment.  I recommend this collection of games.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this case. When I bought the Kindle Fire this is the case that I hoped would fit. Thankfully, I had them show me at the store whether or not it would fit and it fits fine. The fact that this case was designed with bands at each corner makes it a great case for almost any Kindle. I would definitely purchase this again if I needed another case.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I lovey this game so so much it is so much fun and is so ridiculous and I would recommend it for anyone!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|i absolutely love this app.... it gets difficult to get point but that's wat makes the game better.... its not an easy game you can beat in one day
0307946711|1.0|The only reason I kept reading it was because I was hoping that the two main characters would get drunk and pass out in bed and their lit cigarettes would burn the house down and they would both be dead.  These people were so unlikable - I didn't care if they ended up together or as friends or anything.  I don't know what was so \\"funny\\" about this book.  I think I laughed at the joke about orthopedic high heels, but nothing was funny about these two people, this story or the way it was written.  The political statements were lame.  The whole thing was just a waste of time.  I wrote a note in the cover that said \\"read at your own risk - this book sucks\\" and left it in an airport.  I'll probably be arrested for terrorism.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I love the idea of a book's story revolving around photographs. A book of this kind is a first for me, and I thought it was very original. The photographs taken by Ransom Riggs himself draw you in while the story moves at a decent pace that gets you. For those who love a good ya book, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a fresh look at the bizarre.

B000MTFDCO|4.0|Michael Douglas was in 2 unique films during the '90s I believe, \\"A Perfect Murder\\" and \\"The Game\\" by director David Fincher (Seven;Social Network;Curious Case of Benjamin Button) but only \\"Murder\\" scored at the box office which really mystifies me because the second film is unconventional and original at the same time. Douglas of course seems to enjoy playing a seemingly unlikeable character in both films but in \\"The Game\\" he finds himself in a web of contradictions.  Perhaps the unconventionality of the film turned off Douglas fans and they opted for the former but if you like your intellect and senses challenged, do check out this original film. A fine supporting cast includes Sean Penn as his brother, Phillip Baker Hall and Deborah Kara Unger.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is really cool because there are a ton of games to play. I like it so you should get it!:)
0385534639|4.0|When Celia is only 6 years old she is brought to a father she's never known, the great magician Prospero the Enchanter. He's brutal and his motivation is selfish, but he teaches her everything he knows about real magic, in an attempt to lock her in a magical competition she has no say in.  In reality there's no real way to summarize this story. This book is pure magic. The list of characters is large, and all of them important to the plot. The magic is described in a way that makes you want to take every tent home. It really opens up your imagination. I've never been big on circuses but I would be pretty excited going to the one described. And even the structure of the story was interesting. The chapters bounce back in forth in time, first spanning years, then 1 year, than just days. If you're going to read this book, PAY ATTENTION TO THE DATES. This makes the book a little more difficult to read, but it adds to the mystery and magic of the story.  Unfortunately, though, I couldn't really connect to the characters. I felt like the writing was so formal that I couldn't really see the characters as real people. The only characters I really loved were Poppet, Widget, and Bailey. They are younger, and therefore have an excuse to have more personality I guess. Another issue I had was that the love story wasn't really described very well. All of a sudden they were in love (this isn't a spoiler since the book is billed as a love story). I had to pull additional emotion from my imagination since I didn't feel the pages gave me enough of it.  Overall: It was a wonderfully magical story worth a read.  For more reviews check out [...]

B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have tried several Bible reading Apps, buy this is the best I have found.  It would be nice if there was a dictionary function.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this Bible. I like how I can increase the font and its easy to navigate. The addition of different Bible versions is especially handy!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Yes it's been said before for other movies, but despite being an overused word, it fits this movie to a \\"T\\".  Throw away anything you know about anything regarding this genre of movies and buckle up for the ride.  Ever watched a horror movie where the girls watching with you say, \\"awwww\\"?  They will if you can get em to watch this, in between cringing at the gore and laughing at the antics of the ridiculously endearing main characters.  This is not a soft movie that pulls punches, it is definitely horror.  So be leery this may not be your kind of film, but if it is, you'll love it.  PS: This has some of the funniest one liners . . .
B000I0QL82|5.0|Great quality dvd. I would LOVE to see this in color though, I think it would be beautiful! There aren't special features, but I do not generally watch those so I didn't miss them. Other than that, it's a great movie!
B004SUWR2C|1.0|downloaded and charged ...and now it wants me to install 80MB memory to play and the kindle fire keeps telling me the download is interrupted and cannot be completed.  Why do some reviews say it's working and others it's not???  Does anyone have the solution???

0385523912|5.0|My wife and adopted children (13 and 14) are from South Korea, so North Korea is a subject of endless fascination for us. We read this book out loud as a family, and couldn't put it down. Every time I wanted to give my voice a rest, the children insisted that I go on.  Barbara Demick expertly weaves the life stories of several North Korean defectors together into a cohesive, compelling narrative that is honest and gripping but not sensationalistic. Demick is, after all, a journalist, even though this book keeps you turning the pages like a bestselling novel. The simple facts about North Korea are heartwrenching enough and need no embellishment.  The measure of Demick's writing skill is that we really come to care for these people as we watch them evolve from patriotic citizens of the most repressive regime on earth--full participants in the Kim Jong-il cult of personality--to refugees running for their lives, hunted by secret police, soldiers and bounty hunters every step of the way. The triumph of their arrival, one by one, in South Korea, is deeply moving and satisfying.  But Demick is not content to leave it at that. The process of integrating these wounded souls, traumatized by a lifetime of brainwashing, abuse and cruelty, into South Korean society is often difficult. Demick provides the only extended view of this process that I'm aware of in English.  In summary, Nothing to Envy is three books in one: a chronicle of real life in North Korea before and during the famine; a collection of harrowing escape stories; and, finally, a fascinating account of bittersweet redemption as the protagonists face a new set of problems as strangers in a strange land.  My family and I enjoy Korean TV dramas, which are perhaps the best made in the world. Any one of the human subjects in this book could be the hero of his or her own TV drama. These stories will make you stop and think about who you are, what you have, and what it truly costs to be free.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I have to admit, I have been waiting for this movie since I was 7 years old. It was that year that I came across some moldy, badly withered copies of the original Golden Age Captain America comic books. The colorful costume, bizarre villains and intriguing cross between horror comics (ahead of its time in that respect) and an old fashioned heroic archetype was irresistible. I gathered them up and took them home, but never got the chance to actually read all of them as they were immediately discovered by my Mom (how do they do that?) and thrown out into the trash. While my exposure was fleeting, it was indelible. When I saw the uniform on the cover of The Avengers #4 I snatched it out of the rack and rushed home, reading the book every step of the way and repeating that read over and over for days. He was back, that mythical uniform bursting straight off the cover and into my age of the comic book. The Silver Age was finally going big time for me. This was a hero I could not resist, much like Spider-man, because the overarching theme was an intriguing mixture of dedication and doubt. Steve Rogers is a man out of his time, everything and everyone he loved either gone or changed so drastically as to be unrecognizable. He awakens in the world of today, having been buried in a sheet of ice since the waning days of WWII having met his apparent death along with his partner Bucky while on a mission. That is where the modern day mythos of Captain Americas' begins. But the back story, his origin, his ascendency to national icon and his epic confrontation with his opposite, The Red Skull is the story of this movie. It is told well with a great feel for the period combined with wonderful details from the Golden Age Marvel (Timely) universe. It is suitable for a wide audience range, the story is broad enough that the viewer does not have to be a fanboy to follow the plot and has enough insider touches and threads to delight the real fanboys. Captain America has some great effects, some very thrilling action scenes all tied together with a healthy dose of excellent acting. As a set up for the upcoming The Avengers it does not make a wrong move and it will certainly be followed by at least two more sequels. If the quality of this first effort is carried through the sequels, Cap fans are in for a real treat
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have finally got back into a great daily reading plan with this app.  I love the one year Bible plan.  also I was able to download the version that we use in church to my device so I can have it even with no wi fi.  Love it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|like the games but it needs better graphics. overall I like this app and would get more from this designer.

030745455X|5.0|This whole trilogy will suck you in.  It is not often that I am impressed with a book that I'd buy into a \\"trilogy\\" but I am addicted.  And wouldn't you know it?  We may not get anything more from this author, unless they figure out who Mr. Larsson's estate really belongs to.<br /><br />This one explains our hero's past, and why she did what she did and why she isn't finished.

B0012YYZYK|5.0|In the early 70's when Rock was still young and concerts were a major geographical social event, the greatest Rock band of all time decided to pursue a movie project and The Song Remains The Same was born...  Each member of the band has a personal vignette that attempts to capture some of the soul of that person, with the rest mostly being live footage of the 1971 concert in New York's Madison Square Garden. As awesome as the Led Zeppelin albums were, Zepp really took flight when playing live and it shows in this spectacle of the legendary guitar riffs, pounding sonic drums behind the music, magically lifting keyboards and bass, and soaring vocals that scream into the heavens only to lilt softly back to earth... Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John \\"Bonzo\\" Bonham come together to show the world what Rock and Roll was meant to be.  If you were born too late and missed out on the most fun decade the world has known, or just want to go back and revisit the majesty and surreal greatness that was the the epitome of rock concerts, this DVD will do the trick. The BluRay is even more of a feast for the senses... \\"Been a long time since I rock and rolled....\\"  Don't wait another second...this show is just too cool.
B004LROMSO|3.0|Starz gained alot of creds with Sparticus and so they wanted to creat another series. this a result, based on the Arthurian legend. which in the end I find to be a bit of a mixed bag. (Beware Spoilers to follow.)<br /><br />First off I am an avid reader of Arthuiran fiction. I've read Malory, Geoffery, Chretien, and others. I've seen the Arthurian based movies and series. (And written reviews on them. see my page). And I know that NO movie is going to be totaly close to the legend. there are some good versions but some just dont entirly capture the feel. there has been a definitive Robin Hood (Flynn), but not a definitive Arthur movie. there are good ones though. Point is I dont entirly expect this to be totaly close to the legend. which is not a bad thing, but something like this should have the essence of the subject matter. this has the elements and a few twists. some may claim that there is a bit of modern 'political correctness'. Maybe there is but thats nothing new. Its also not so 'modern'. esspessily to Arthurian fiction. one need simply read Chretien to know that. (And lets not forget his patron was the daughter of one of the most powerful of women in the Midevil period). There are other examples as well of strong women in Arthurian fiction. Look at the 'Wedding of Gawain', Malory's story of Sir Gareth would be nothing without the strong willed Linet, and so on.<br /><br />That is not to say this series has its faults. it does. for various reasons. before I get to that let me speak of the actors.<br />At the top of the list is Joseph Fiennes as Merlin, Eva Green as Morgan, and Sinead Cusack as Sybil. these are by far the best of the cast meambers and really make the series. if you watch it then watch it for no other reason then these actors.Then there is Jamie Campbell Bower as Arthur. at first he seems a bit of a fop, dishonorable, and unfit. yet as the sereies progresses his charture changes. for the better. he becomes the Arthur of legend. And maybe that's the point. that he starts out as reckless but becomes the hero he needs to be. still Fiennes excells as Merlin. he's clearly mad, not allways trust worthy, but loyal to the ideal of Camelot. Green is bitter, cunning, and strong willed. Cusack is another treat. her charture cares for Morgan as much as Merlin cares for Arthur. she is also intelligent and cunning. these main actors are what carry the series and are fun to watch. the others do a decent job, but some let the side down just a bit.<br /><br />Ultimatly in the end I can only reivew this series episode by episode. Because they have their good and bad points. I just cant review the series as a whole because of the jumble we get here. partly because of the writers, and other reasons.<br /><br />-Homecoming- Uther is slain, Morgan lusts for power and allies herself with Lot, and Merlin seeks out Arthur and tells him his true hertige. This episode has a lot of potential. some things are rather contrived. (It seems to quick for some of the knights to automaticly pledge their alleigance to Arthur.) Yet there is still the potential. Merlin has the dream of Camelot. he hopes Arthur will forfill this dream, and Arthur could become the king of legend, but there is a chance he wont. there is the possiblity he will fail. This is something I found to be interesting and they really could have worked on this angle a bit more. Arthur at first seems a typical reckless youth. he beds whatever woman he can get his hands on. he is awed and bewildered by what has been cast upon him. he dosent interly understand it all. yet he wants to do what is right. I think what lets the side down a bit is James Purefoy as Lot. He's not a bad actor. it's just his charture seems to familur to other roles he's played. his Lot is no different then Anthony in Rome for example. This is porbably my main complaint for this episode.<br /><br />-The Sword and the Crown- Arthur meets Guinevere, who he's been having dreams about. Morgan and Lot attack but Lot is defeated. Arthur claims the sword from the stone. Another good starter episode. the new telling of the sword in stone story is interesting and inventive. I also like that there are hints that Merlin set up this whole thing. Purefoy again lets the side down a bit again, but his charture meets his fate in the end. he beats Morgan, but is himself destroyed by Arthur. (Allthough you get the sense that if he had not lost to Arthur he would not have outlived Morgan). the highlight is really how Arthur is achiveing his inhertiance and Merlin's aid in this matter. Both Kay and Arthur have lost their only family to Lot. this angle could have been played up a bit more, as its a bit hard to really feel for the chatures.<br /><br />-Guinevere-These next two episodes I admit are not the best written. Leontes is one of the knights who serves Arthur. Kay and leontes seek out Gawain to come to Camelot, he reluctantly agrees. Arthur and Merlin are invited to feast with Morgan, which they do. merlin is himself taken prisoner. guinevere and Leontes are to be married but Arthur lusts after her. he wishes to be with her before her wedding. the twist here with Guinevere is that she is betrothed to Leontes, who himself willing serves Arthur. (This is all a whole twist on the Arthur-Guinevere-Lancelot relationship). Morgan menwhile is using magic and it is costing her. the first thing I didnt care for is that Merlin and Arthur go to see Morgan without guards and are rather brazen. there seemed no good reason for this thinking. it was silly. of course they would be traped and tricked. aparently Arthur is just that blind about Morgan. aslo it is hard to see Arthur act in such a dishonrable manner. (and I see others think so too). He surrenders to his lust and risks everything. it didnt seem right.<br /><br />-Lady of the Lake- Arthur's sword is broken. Merlin seeks a new one from the swordmaker Caliburn, who wants to kill Arthur. his daughter, Excalibur, takes the sword but dies by accident in a lake. Merlin takes the sword from her dead hand. Arthur is upset that he cant be with Guinevere but she inspires him to do change things. While Morgan is ill there enters a nun, Syble (Cusack) who aids her. Again this is a weak episode. Caliburn's motives are rather murcky and it would have been nice if they were fleshed out. we need to know why he wants Arthur dead. it would have made the tragidy of his dauther's death more meaningful. however, I like Merlin's deceptive way of relating how he got the sword and establishes the legend. Arthur again isnt acting his best here. the highlight however is the introduction of Syble. it may be tempting for some viewers to give up at this point. I see some have, and I was almost tempted to as well. I encourage you to hang in there, the series improves.<br /><br />-Justice- Arthur and his knights look into a murder charge and they hold a trial, while Morgan minpulates merchants to come to her side. this is by far the better of episodes. this is where things start to improve and get better. here Arthur is acting as he should, as a man of honor. he is the Arthur of legend here. a man of the people who wants to improve his lands. yet at the same time Morgan uses cunning to change peoples minds using 'justice' to her own ends. Arthur uses justice to give hope. Morgan uses it to establish fear. this is a rather nice parrallel. this is one of my favorite episodes and agian its when things realy make their turning point. Arthur sees his own faults and sees he must do better. not only for himself but to others. I rather enjoyed this episode.<br /><br />-Three Journeys-Guinever travels to see her dying father, Arthur goes with her. Kay, Merlin, and some of the knights travel to Kay's home for a libary. A nun come to see Morgan telling her how Syble had burned down the nunnery. this is a rather interesting episode with different storys going on at once. on the one hand we have guinevere dealing with her father's death,the guilt for her actions, but her genuin love for Arthur. Arthur also loves her and is also guiltful. Kay is reluctant to go back home, but in the end finds beloved memorys of the past. merlin is incouraged to use magic rather then not use it. morgan is torn between admistering justice in front of everyone or punishing Syble, whome she cares for. it is another well written episode. I liked the mutliple storys going on and the chature devlopment.<br /><br />-The Long Night- Arthur and his court spends the night at Morgan's castle. she has various entertainments and stages a fake attack. at least time Arthur was smarter when visiting his sister. Merlin genuinly wants to go just for the sake of knowing what Morgan is planning. its interesting to see the 'staged' attack and how it effects the knights. Arthur genuinly believes it is real and wants to protect Morgan. all the while Morgan is discovering out the secrets of Camelot. in particular what happend with Arthur and Guinevere. its a nice little 'misleading' episode. at the end Igraine is taken prisoner and Morgan has taken her shape.<br /><br />-Igraine- As Igraine Morgan infiltrates Camelot. she seduces Merlin, exposes Guinevere, and all the while meets Igraine's friend a small orphined boy, Redwald. Igraine in the meantime uses all her wiles to escape and return to Camelot. Redwald is a nice chature a young dreamer. yet he sees Morgan's true self and by accident is killed. (those who dont like to see children harmed may not care for this episode.) It seems Morgan is genuinly affected by the boy, but the final scean shows her true colors. its a rather well written episode. showing how Igraine is and how Morgan precieves her. how Merlin cares for her and how he feels he is dangerous when people get to close to him. we see how a servant of Morgan is twisted in that love and convinced to stage an attack at the Bardon Pass. Vivian, Morgan's servant, however questions her misteresses actions. Syble however willing does all she hast to all for Morgan's sake. even though Green is not shown, her pressence is felt.<br /><br />-The Battle of Bardon Pass- (Bardon seems to me to be a refrence to the Battle of Badon, one of Arthur's well known victorys.) Morgan's troops attack the pass, Arthur and his men ride to defend the pass. Merlin finds out what Morgan has done, he and Igraine ride off to confront her, but are captured. Leontes in the meantime confronts both Guinever and Arthur. in the end it is Arthur alone who is left at the pass. This is a good episode. the only bit that lets the side down is Merlin and Igraine ridding off to confront Morgan. this seemed rather silly, and doomed to fail. the other bits were good. how the guilt of Arthur is exposed and how it effects the men. the battle sceans are well done. In the meantime Morgan is closer to achieving her goals.<br /><br />-Reckoning-Arthur alone defends the pass, it is believed he is slain. Morgan claims the crown. Leontes and the men return to aid Arthur, Leontes is slain. Arthur confronts Morgan. Syble takes the blame for all, and is executed. Morgan is left alone. Arthur and his men decide to honor Leontes and to achieve the goal that they set out to do. to creat a Camelot worthy of legend. Igraine in the meantime has been slain by Morgan and Merlin decides to leave. he sees that Arthur no longer needs him. this is the culmination of the series. we see that Arthur is becoming the man of legend, the man he was meant to be. it is fun to see him fight alone against so many. peace is gained between him and Leontes. all seems to be set to rights in Camelot. Arthur shows how he wants to give people peace, while Morgan gave them fear. he becomes the man the people and the land need. we see that he shall set up the legend that we all know. we even see the Round Table begining to be set up. Morgan, however, has taken Guinevere's shape and seduces Arthur. she departs, no dought to birth Mordred.<br /><br />So agian, in the end thisis a bit of a mixed series. its not toatly bad, it just could have used more work in some areas. some things were well done, others could have been worked out better. there were parts that were not so well written that could have imporved. its all a jumble.<br />over all Id say its a decent series. good. not terrible. but good. if you are interested give it a chance. it has potential.<br /><br />sadly this series lasted only one season. it was canceled for various reasons and there will be no second series.<br />which is a pity. a few better episodes really could have helped this series.<br /><br />but you have to take what you can get. some episodes are quit enjoyable. others needed more work.guiltful. Kay is reluctant to go back home, but in the end finds beloved memorys of the past. merlin is incouraged to use magic rather then not use it. morgan is torn between admistering justice in front of everyone or punishing Syble, whome she cares for. it is another well written episode. I liked the mutliple storys going on and the chature devlopment.  -The Long Night- Arthur and his court spends the night at Morgan's castle. she has various entertainments and stages a fake attack. at least time Arthur was smarter when visiting his sister. Merlin genuinly wants to go just for the sake of knowing what Morgan is planning. its interesting to see the 'staged' attack and how it effects the knights. Arthur genuinly believes it is real and wants to protect Morgan. all the while Morgan is discovering out the secrets of Camelot. in particular what happend with Arthur and Guinevere. its a nice little 'misleading' episode. at the end Igraine is taken prisoner and Morgan has taken her shape.  -Igraine- As Igraine Morgan infiltrates Camelot. she seduces Merlin, exposes Guinevere, and all the while meets Igraine's friend a small orphined boy, Redwald. Igraine in the meantime uses all her wiles to escape and return to Camelot. Redwald is a nice chature a young dreamer. yet he sees Morgan's true self and by accident is killed. (those who dont like to see children harmed may not care for this episode.) It seems Morgan is genuinly affected by the boy, but the final scean shows her true colors. its a rather well written episode. showing how Igraine is and how Morgan precieves her. how Merlin cares for her and how he feels he is dangerous when people get to close to him. we see how a servant of Morgan is twisted in that love and convinced to stage an attack at the Bardon Pass. Vivian, Morgan's servant, however questions her misteresses actions. Syble however willing does all she hast to all for Morgan's sake. even though Green is not shown, her pressence is felt.  -The Battle of Bardon Pass- (Bardon seems to me to be a refrence to the Battle of Badon, one of Arthur's well known victorys.) Morgan's troops attack the pass, Arthur and his men ride to defend the pass. Merlin finds out what Morgan has done, he and Igraine ride off to confront her, but are captured. Leontes in the meantime confronts both Guinever and Arthur. in the end it is Arthur alone who is left at the pass. This is a good episode. the only bit that lets the side down is Merlin and Igraine ridding off to confront Morgan. this seemed rather silly, and doomed to fail. the other bits were good. how the guilt of Arthur is exposed and how it effects the men. the battle sceans are well done. In the meantime Morgan is closer to achieving her goals.  -Reckoning-Arthur alone defends the pass, it is believed he is slain. Morgan claims the crown. Leontes and the men return to aid Arthur, Leontes is slain. Arthur confronts Morgan. Syble takes the blame for all, and is executed. Morgan is left alone. Arthur and his men decide to honor Leontes and to achieve the goal that they set out to do. to creat a Camelot worthy of legend. Igraine in the meantime has been slain by Morgan and Merlin decides to leave. he sees that Arthur no longer needs him. this is the culmination of the series. we see that Arthur is becoming the man of legend, the man he was meant to be. it is fun to see him fight alone against so many. peace is gained between him and Leontes. all seems to be set to rights in Camelot. Arthur shows how he wants to give people peace, while Morgan gave them fear. he becomes the man the people and the land need. we see that he shall set up the legend that we all know. we even see the Round Table begining to be set up. Morgan, however, has taken Guinevere's shape and seduces Arthur. she departs, no dought to birth Mordred.  So agian, in the end this is a bit of a mixed series. its not toatly bad, it just could have used more work in some areas. some things were well done, others could have been worked out better. there were parts that were not so well written that could have imporved. its all a jumble.  over all Id say its a decent series. good. not terrible. but good. if you are interested give it a chance. it has potential.  sadly this series lasted only one season. it was canceled for various reasons and there will be no second series.  which is a pity. a few better episodes really could have helped this series.  but you have to take what you can get. some episodes are quit enjoyable. others needed more work.
0525478817|5.0|I really loved this book. I feel like I end up hating the protagonist of most YA novels because they're immature, not relatable, etc. But Hazel is the opposite. She's witty and compassionate and so incredibly relatable (especially considering her voice was written by a guy). Her viewpoint on dying is one I had never thought of before and it's a really brave one when you think about it. It reminded me of Franny and Zooey, where one of them (I can't remember who) says something about not having the courage to be an absolute nobody. That's what Hazel has. She has the courage to be an absolute nobody just to save people from the \\"wounds\\" her death would cause. She's obsessively worried about Anna's mom in An Imperial Affliction just as she's obsessively worried about her own mom and dad and how their lives will turn out after she passes. Gus, on the other hand, is the complete opposite. He wants his death to change someone's life forever; Hazel wants no one to be affected by her death. Gus represents more of the classic version of heroism that we immediately think of, but I think Hazel's is the more selfless kind of heroism. She almost cares more about other people than Gus does because she doesn't want to emotionally hurt them and scar their lives while Gus is more concerned about meaning something to someone and leaving a mark.  Aside from all of that, this book made me laugh, awkwardly, in public places and, yes, even cry. It was so enveloping and hard to get away from and I  just really really really recommend it.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'm gonna be honest, if you haven't read this book you really are missing out.  I've read this so many times I can't even tell you.  I've laughed. I cried. I'm not sure I've read books that make me really feel as much as this one does. I know that sounds sort of odd, but it's true. This book makes me think about so many things, yet at the same time it makes me forget about so many things.  People say this book is a \\"teen book\\" or whatever, I'll somewhat agree. The first time I read this book I was a senior in high school. I'm now a sophomore in college and this is one book that I honestly feel will be one of those books I'll continue to read throughout my life. I want my children to read this book when they're in high school. I really do believe this is should be a required reading for all young adults or even people who have teenage children.  I promise you, you will not regret reading this book.
B005KAH7QU|1.0|I watched this movie mainly because the trailer was well made and the ranking was very high at IMDB (7.1 at that time with 20-30K raters). I was thrilled during the first 15 minutes then at the middle of the film I was already bored. I kept watching it hoping some good twist or surprise towards the end of the film. I was wrong, totally wrong. One thing I did learn from this movie is not to count on the reviews/ratings. But then, how and where can we get more objective opinions. It is not about the money wasted on this stupid film, but about the time and emotion you put in that 100 mins.  I will never watch a movie directed by Joe Wright.

B004LROUW2|2.0|Just finished reading all 1000 pages of 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami. That was time I'll never get back. There was something in the eliptical writing, a sense that the story was going somewhere, a palpable danger that kept me reading. He does have a beautiful, disctinctive voice. But I got to the last 50 pages, thinking: Buddy, you better deliver. He didn't. Not even a little bit. So much was left hanging, unexplained, and traded in for sticky sentiment between two characters I already didn't care that much about. Normally, I don't review books, good or bad, but I have to warn people away from this mindless time suck.

Got refund on ebay and purchased on Amazon through a vendor that is \\"fulfilled by Amazon.\\" MISTAKE! SAME BS!!!! Another counterfeit item identical to the fake item on ebay sold on Amazon for $234. BEWARE of this item anywhere on the internet. Recommend pay more and buy locally if you can find it. Or look for the silver set that has each season packaged indvidually. Horrible shopping experience on ebay and Amazon.

0525478817|5.0|I consider myself something of an avid reader and few novels have done to me what this one did. I am a 26 year old male. A Civil Engineer in the state of Texas and was raised in the state of Mississippi in the exact manner you might suspect. While I show my emotions more than most of those who live around me, it is still somewhat of an oddity for something like a book to elicit anything more significant that a \\"Wow, what a good book\\" when I'm done. John Green.....you have written a fantastic novel that reaches any reader who picks it up. I would recommend this book to anyone I come across (and have). A MUST read.

It is truly his best work to date, I can't recall a book that made me laugh just as much as it made me cry. I would recommend this book to anyone. Don't hesitate to buy it.
B0068ZGHQM|5.0|This is my favorite show on TV.  Ryan Murphy is a genius! If you loke Horror movies and mysteries you will love this show.  The whole idea of a severly haunted house where the ghosts are not only visible to the living but also active on the physical plane (they can kill and have sex). The whole idea becomes so much scarier!  The season was amazing and I can't wait to see what next season has in store for us!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wow, these books are action packed and really grab your attention. At first I was like, \\"there is no way I am gonna like these books cause they are just too far out there\\". Boy was I wrong!!!!!!! I loved them. Just thinking about them makes my heart race with all of the action and intrigue. The bond between Katniss and Prim is great (the kind of sisterly love that every sister wants to have). The emotions between Katniss, Gale and Peeta are so realistic. And for the Hunger Games all I can say is, \\"WOW, what a heart pumping, tear jerking and action packed idea\\".
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|I enjoyed this film on a few different levels.  Yes, it is a great baseball movie about an underdog team, but is also about being an underdog in life in general.  The movie can be motivational for anyone, basically sending the message; do the most with what you have.  Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill contribute homerun performances with subtle humor throughout.  A great behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of baseball, but also the personal inner-struggle of an individual who never reached their potential.  There is also a small subplot of a strong father-daughter relationship.  I'm a moderate baseball fan, but I recommended this movie to non-baseball fans and they also enjoyed it immensely.

Nothing impressed me as Bram Stoker's Dracula!  Nothing Dracula has impressed me as much since!  Yes it went into my keeper's collection!

B00457WZEI|5.0|I finished this book in less than two days. It was a fun and great read with plenty of action, drama and humor to keep you reading.  A young horse by the name of Joey was raised by a young boy from England, Albert. It was a good life for little Joey till the war came. Alberts father traded him to the English troops for money in order to save his farm. Joey was seperated from Albert for a long time, he tells his tell as a calvary horse, a vet horse and more. Joey was determined to be reunited with the young English laddy whom he trusted and loved dearly. That day did finally come with some sad outcoms on Joey's trageties as a war horse.  I'm planning on reading Farm Boy as well, which is the 2nd book of the series.

B006OFN0BQ|5.0|Clint Eastwood, Dustin Lance Black and Leonardo DiCaprio join forces to understand the 20th century's most admired, hated and controversial man, J. Edgar Hoover (with a tour de force performance by DiCaprio).  Let me first say that when I first heard of this project in the works I virtually knew very little about the F.B.I founder. I had however seen great depictions by actors like Bob Hoskins, Vincent Gardenia, Billy Crudup and more recently by Enrico Colantoni. All good performances without a doubt but only two dimensional portrayals. Here DiCaprio creates a 5th dimensional character that the audience can try to more or less understand.  The film spans nearly 50 years in the history timeline, jumping timeframe by time frame and creating a rich tapestry of political drama and turmoil in our nation's history. DiCaprio plays both the young, ambitious and advanced Hoover as well as the old, embittered czar whom all politicians feared by the 1950's.Armie Hammer plays his protege and second man in the Bureau Clyde Tolson. Hammer is the soul and conscience of the film as well as Hoover's constantly ignored emotions. Judi Dench, Naomi Watts and Jeffrey Donovan turn in great performances as well. The screenplay is rich and meticulously researched and Eastwood's direction has perfected greatly to the point of crafting his most ambitous, and richest project since his excellent \\"Flags/Letters\\" duo.  If you enjoy history, historical dramas, this is for you. A thought provoking, psychological insight into this man's soul and heart and the effect he had on this nation's history. One of the most chilling moments in the film happens toward end when a anxiously devastated Hoover witnesses the inaugural of Richard Nixon amd almost forsees the devastation that will befall the U.S. with the race riots, Vietnam, protesting students and assasination of MLK and etc, while \\"Star and Stripes Forever\\" plays in the background and if the audience undertands it, they begin to mourn the death of our nation.  Eastwood almost mirrors Oliver Stone in a more calm way but by the end of the film your opinion is yours and yours alone. I watched this 5 times in theatres and I would damn well watch it again because it is simply an American Masterpiece from an American Master who has clearly matured and seen the significant changes in our country. I can only hope this review does this film justice for all the misjudgements there have been about it. Frankly, it is the best picture of the year!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Missile Defender is basically a remake of Missile Command on the old school Atari game system or arcade machines. The concept is simple: shoot your missiles to destroy incoming missiles before they destroy your city. There are two sizes of enemy missiles: standard and oh-my-god-watch-out. Luckily the latter are larger targets and rarely get through your defenses.<br /><br />At first the game is fairly easy. Enemy missiles are slow. You just tap your screen a short distance ahead of them and they explode in your blast radius. The objective is to use your blast radius more than scoring a direct missile to missile collision. My first run through on this game was a little sloppier than it should have been, but my second run through I had a better grasp on timing and positioning my blasts that I scored mostly perfect round through level 25.<br /><br />As you progress through the levels, the missiles get faster. A lot faster. Some fly off in unexpected direction. The bigger, deadlier missiles appear more frequently, and I'm fairly certain missile quantity increases.<br /><br />Fortunately, you can upgrade your armaments as you go along. You can increase missile speed, missile quantity, blast radius, and blast duration each to level 5. If you score mostly perfects and don't have to waste your points on building repairs, scoring these boosts rolls along at a steady pace. I'd recommend increasing missile speed first. It helps. I went speed > radius > duration > quantity until they were all level 2, then repeated for all 5 levels. Worked well for me. You could probably hold off on quantity a bit. Unless you're just randomly tapping the screen all over in a 'hope you hit something' style approach, you probably won't run low on missiles. You will need to upgrade but quantity isn't the most important boost.<br /><br />At times the game can be a little nerve-racking. It's hard to pay attention to everything going on once the speed and quantity of incoming missiles really gets going. Missiles start sneaking by. Buildings are destroyed. By this point I'd already upgraded everything to maximum, so I could just use my points to rebuild, but as levels increase, building costs increase, so losing is inevitable. That's how these types of games work though. It's definitely high on replay value, as you try to best your score.s are destroyed.

0525478817|5.0|The sheer rawness of The Fault in Our Stars is completely outrageous. I mean, who would have the nerve to write something to absolutely honest, or so unimaginably true to life? Who writes about a girl in a book whom is obsessed with a book about a girl in her exact situation? Tis madness. The Fault in Our Stars displays nearly every attribute necessary to make a good book--and it displays them well. I have a feeling John Green going to go down in history as one of Those Authors, if you know what I mean.
B000TBG8HY|4.0|I bought this vinyl along with yellow submarine. It was a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. I was a bit hesitant to buy this because the description stated there were slight scratches but plays well. But this was the only vinyl I found that had the complete color book still attached to the jacket. My boyfriend had no idea it even came with a booklet which made it that much sweeter. I'm happy to say it plays really well with 1 scratch, but not noticeable. By far the magical mystery tour is my favorite:)
0307279189|5.0|The author of this book is not only a runner, he was a hurt runner with no one who seemed to be able to offer him more than occasional shots of cortisone into the sole of his foot.  That wasn't good enough so we went on a quest to find someone who could offer something more.<br /><br />This starting point lead McDougall on an unexpected and unpredictable trail that led eventually to a hermit-like running man who lived in the extremely isolated Copper Canyon of the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, home of the Tarahumara Indians.  The Tarahumara were, he discovered, perhaps the best long distance runners in the world.<br /><br />Along the way we are introduced to the sport of ultra-distance running and that rare breed, the ultra-distance runner.  This typically eccentric, but almost superhuman collection of characters spend their spare time going on runs 3, 4, 5 hours long, just for fun.  When they compete, their races are at least 50 miles, sometimes 100 miles, or even longer!  How do they do it?  Why do they do it, and what do they share in common with other long-distance running cultures?<br /><br />You'll just have to read the book to find out.<br /><br />Personally, the part of the book that I found absolutely amazing was toward the end where the author provides a glimpse into the anatomy and physiology of the human body, and of a theory that is gaining strength - the running man theory.  This theory states, in general, that humans are built to run.  We ran to eat, we ran to migrate, and we ran for pleasure.  And we did all that originally in bare feet.  As a biologist I was spellbound when the author shared information from researchers who studied anatomical and behavioral difference between running and non-running species.  I am embarrassed to say that I never caught onto the observation before than humans are the only bipedal species that is designed to run, but that does not have a tail!<br /><br />I could go on and on, but the short of it is that while you don't have to be a runner to enjoy this book, it helps.  I am a mere hobby jogger compared to the ultra-distance runners in this book (the farthest I've ever run is a 1/2 marathon).  Still I felt a distant kinship with the people in the book.<br /><br />Easily 5 stars.  Highly recommended!I am a mere hobby jogger compared to the ultra-distance runners in this book (the farthest I've ever run is a 1/2 marathon).

1451627289|2.0|I liked the premise of the book and couldn't wait to read it.  I enjoyed it immensely until the romance part of it started.  It ALL seemed like filler, which of course it was, since he had to fill up 5 years worth of time before the big day in Big D.    As a native Texan, I was totally confused about all Jake's movings around (besides what was necessary to keep up with Oswald).  Mr. King invented Jody, Texas as a place south of Dallas, but had the characters go quite often to Killeen, which is just north of San Antonio.  On a world map that might look close, but it was disconcerting to a person who knows how long a trip that would actually be.  AND - how difficult would it have been to find another hospital to take the characters to besides Parkland?  I GET the whole \\"history repeats itself\\" concept, but really, you'd pass 20 hospitals to get to that one in some cases.    I kept telling myself that the reason he went back to 1958 was because Tugga was going to reappear later in the book and make a huge difference, bad or good, to the whole plot.  Maybe he'd be the man on the grassy knoll.  Who knows?  But no, never mentioned again.    Some of the concepts were interesting.  The look at how things used to be was interesting except when a whole chapter was used in some cases for no other reason than to point out that things were different then.  The saving of the family in Maine was really good, and oh yes, I did learn a lot about Oswald, but overall, I'm disappointed.
0440244412|5.0|To start things off, I do understand what a few reviewers said about there being an overload of illusion and so many twits and turns. It can be confusing. However that is one of the tings I loved so much about this series. I never had a moment where I could accurately predict what was coming next.  Now about this book. I HATED the beginning of this book. I didn't hate the style, I just felt physically ill from the moment Barrons \\"died\\". I don't think I have ever raced through chapters faster than I sped through those. Dani's speed had nothing on me. The grief was palpable and was almost more than I could stomach. I give MAJOR props to an author who could do that. Once I got to Barron's \\"rebirth\\" I was a happy camper again. This is a great book, an even better series, and one I am sad to see end. I hope the rumors of spin-offs turn out to be true. I'm very interested to read more from this author.

My lack of desire of reading about it on my leisure time is NOT what I wanted, granted I was expecting some from the title alone.  I was NOT expecting the depth of which Steele went into for the plot, & setting.  I did however, appreciate the struggles the Martins' went through as Heloise was growing up.
B004A8ZWXS|5.0|I loved this movie.  The fact that it was from the viewpoint of the horse was very compelling for me.  In my opinion, it also continues to reflect Steven Spielberg's willingness to take risks and be creative.  The story was visually stimulating.  Each character that \\"owned\\" the horse drew me in and I became involved.  I went to see this movie 2 times in it's opening weekend.  I have never before done that and I left the theatre telling my friends that I am going to purchase it.  Best movie I have seen in a long time.
B005HEGS9G|5.0|\\"I was a complete gentleman the entire time.\\" ~ Tripp.  Yep, he's pregnant! He's the first human male in Earth's history to do so.  This is a great Star Trek episode, and one of the few from season 1 worth remembering.  It's a comedy spiced with Trek.  There's even Klingons!  Folks, if you are going to watch some Enterprise, watch this one.  Just be prepared for a lot of male maternity jokes.  4.8/5 Stars.  ~Keep On Trekkin'

B005K0HDGE|2.0|King has written some of the best books extant in his chosen genre, The Stand, Carrie, Salem`s Lot, The Shining, etc. He had a great opprotunity here to write a great book. At times, it rose to the occasion, however the constant errors of things out of their time  would make my heart sink. The NFC did not exist in 1963, neither did I-30 in Dallas. I`m from Texas and lived during that time and no high school coach in this state , or teacher for that matter would have been caught drinking at party of any kind that students would have attended. The list goes on and on. King`s own political biases and obvious cliched dislike of the State of Texas are disappointing too. The worst, though, is the lame, lame, lame ending, which pretty much tries to illustrate that everything is predestined and that if one were to change anything then the world and or universe will break apart. Who ever said that? The bad guys win !    Don`t spend the money on this one, he has obviously lost his edge and fallen into the trap of senior political bias.
0143119680|5.0|A witch is something Diana has never wanted to embrace being. Running through her blood is some of the most potent blood known to man and all she wants to do is run from it. When she stumbles upon an ancient manuscript her dreary life suddenly comes to a grinding halt. Now all types of creatures are coming to look for her and without the training necessary she stands no chance of being able to defend herself.<br /><br />Vampire Matthew has been searching for this book for many centuries and now that Diana has been able to recall it he knows he must stop at nothing to get his hands on it. Only problem is that he is more interested in the witch and protecting her then he is with the actual book. Racing against time and those who wish her harm, Diana and Matthew will have to open their hearts and souls to the fantastic in order to survive.<br /><br />Have you ever wondered what would happen if Twilight and Harry Potter had an adult baby? Well, look no further because A Discovery Of Witches is exactly that. This is probably one of my favorite books of 2011..and yes I finished it just in the nick of time to say that. A Discovery Of Witches has it all! Suspense, mystery, intrigue and romance.<br /><br />The beginning of the book starts out a bit slow and I wasn't sure how I was going to connect to scholar Diana. she's extremely bright and for the first quarter of the book there is a TON of science. That was never my strong suit in school so I can admit to be a little lost in the complexity of what was written. Past that though, Diana started to grow on me. She's smart and inquisitive and really, completely naive about her witch heritage. Choosing to run from it and create stories about her parents death that didn't involve witchcraft. Her reality is coming slowly unwrapped, as are her powers when Matthew shows up. He can give Edward Cullen a run for his money any day....and I'm pretty sure he would kick his butt. Matthew is also extremely smart and is a doctor in his own rights. Fifteen hundred years is a long time in which to gain all kinds of knowledge in many different areas. The one thing that eludes him however, is creationism. He strives to find out how himself, witches and daemons all came into existence and Diana holds the key in her ability to call up a long lost manuscript.<br /><br />When Matthew starts protecting Diana instead of trying to get the manuscript for himself things get really interesting. He crosses a line with witches, vampires and daemons that has them all out to get Diana, the power she possesses deep within her blood and the manuscript that holds the key to everyones undoing. The possessiveness Matthew portrays is heartfelt and emotionally raw. I was slept away by his tidal wave of emotions he experienced while trying not to admit to himself that he was in love with Diana and simply trying to protect her for the sake of the manuscript.<br /><br />I enjoyed Diana's slow evolution into the witch she will be become in the following books. It was a breath of fresh air to see a witch just coming into her powers and not knowing how to do or control what she has. She is a witch unlike any other in that she has the ability to do most everything imaginable. Which for the sake of this book, is unheard of. The world building is superb and by the end of the book I was half way understanding the science behind it...which for me, is a huge feat. :)<br /><br />There is an entire array of secondary characters that make the book so much more. From the creative daemons to Diana's two meddling aunts there is a bit of something for everyone. I especially liked the fact that Diana's childhood home is haunted and the house has a life of its own. It's very \\"Poltergeist\\" the way the house takes and returns things when it feels they are needed. Even growing extra room before guests arrive. Definitely not like anything I have read before.<br /><br />A Discovery Of Witches has all the fast paced witchcraft of Harry Potter melted perfectly with the romance of Twilight and wrapped up nicely is a brilliantly written story! I can't wait for the next book to come out later this year!!!<br /><br />I give A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness 5 stars!<br /><br />Nikki- Ramblings From A Chaotic Mindantly written story! I can't wait for the next book to come out later this year!!!  I give A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness 5 stars!  Nikki- Ramblings From A Chaotic Mind

0312641893|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Every once in a while, as story comes along that will completely take me by surprise. That will capture my attention and refuse to let go. Cinder is one of those stories.  And I was quite apprehensive about reading it too. What with the fairytale story turned on its head and a cyborg taking the place of the Cinderella we all know and love.<br /><br />But the thing is, Marissa Meyer isn't retelling Cinderella at all. This is an entirely different story with some throwback moments to the original. But Cinder stands all by itself as a strong novel with an immensely well thought out plot, characters that are so vivid that you'll either love and adore them or hate them with a fiery passion, and a setting that comes to life. I loved it!<br /><br />Cinder is everything a reader could ask for in a heroine. She's strong, snarky, has quite the attitude, but is also incredibly sweet and loving. She's a cyborg, but she's more human than her not-so-nice stepmother. Her relationship with her stepsister Peony is the backbone to the story and Cinder's love for the young girl comes through in all of her actions.<br /><br />The plague that threatens Cinder's home of New Beijing is captivating. The scientists, the research, all of it ties into Cinder's life and will surprise readers again and again. The growing tension between Cinder's world and that of the manipulative Queen Levana is palpable from the first page, but the twists thrown in are entirely unexpected and had me unable to put the book down. Readers will be dying to know more about Cinder, about Prince Kai, about Queen Levana, about the plague, and about a past that no one seems to know about.<br /><br />Cinder will capture all readers, despite it seeming to be targeted towards a sci-fi audience. It is a phenom of a book with so many surprised thrown in to keep readers on their toes, while also adding touches of a fairytale we all know. Marissa Meyer has created the first of what is sure to be an enthralling series that I'm dying to read more of.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|I just purchased the zoom for the kinect because of small space living room,we were backed up to our couch it was miserable. I really don't understand why this zoom is not rated higher because it works great.I think most people are simply not installing it correctly. you just can't clip it on and expect it to be lined up the first time,I ran into this at first then I slid the zoom on the kinect just a bit to the rite and left until I felt and herd the click! and then it was just a matter of dialing in the kinect with the new zoom lens. the zoom cut the distance we were playing in half.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|perfect! I love it!  wastes time! great variety! I love love love it! sometimes I fall asleep playing it.! addicting!
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|I absolutely love these animals. They are very cute and sturdy. It's worth paying what Lego.com charges, which is ten ninety-nine. I bought it as an addition to my huge tub of duplos. I actually enjoy playing with them and making interesting play theme like play slide, and let my  20 months old son slide those animals down.  I bought this set because I wanted to make a zoo, and it's affordable. The animals are all babies. The giraffe's head is not movable, unlike the mommy giraffe where my son likes moving her head up and down (found it at yard sale) Toddler boys will always prefer cars, but if you can make a fun set out of your big duplo sets and your imagination, your toddler will have a lot of fun playing with you.

0307959856|3.0|I have never been interested in Jane Austen sequels, but when I heard that veteran crime writer P. D. James had written a murder mystery set five years after the end of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, at Pemberley, the ancestral home of Fitzwilliam Darcy and his new bride Elizabeth Bennett, I was intrigued. And James' prologue is magnificent, twelve pages summarizing the original book from a fresh point of view, in impeccable period style, and with a wit echoing Austen's own. Her stylistic comfort continues as she moves the story forward, showing Elizabeth confident in her role as mother of two boys and mistress of the Pemberley household as it prepares for the annual Lady Anne Ball.<br /><br />Then death strikes: a murder in a wooded part of the estate. It is fascinating to watch James apply her police procedural mode to the very different legal system of the early 19th century, and carry it through from the first interviews and local inquest to the eventual trial in London (a process that now seems to us hopelessly unbalanced). For the magistrate, Sir Selwyn Hardcastle, is soon convinced he has his man -- somebody whose conviction and execution, even whose trial, could bring shame on the Darcy and Bennett families. But since this is P. D. James, we know there will be more to it than at first appears. And so we read on.<br /><br />Here, however, she comes adrift. Her stunning earlier ability to channel Austen seems to desert her. The style remains, but we get used to it and it just becomes ordinary. She is forced to move out of Austen territory and introduce other characters, in particular a family of Darcy retainers, who do not fully come to life. Equally seriously, a Darcy who is seen as devoted husband, responsible landowner, and man of action is no longer the aloof and mysterious Byronic figure of the original book; though believably real, he is no longer interesting. Elizabeth, everyone's favorite heroine, does retain some life in the earlier chapters, especially as she watches her sister-in-law Georgiana being discreetly pursued by two rival suitors. But by the second half of the book, she has virtually disappeared, and half the fun of reading an Austen sequel has gone.<br /><br />Mystery writers eventually explain things; it's what they do. James steps up to the plate twice, both as a mystery writer and as a romance novelist, but amazingly strikes out both times. There are indeed revelations about the murder at the end, but they involve events that have scarcely been prepared or minor characters introduced only pages before; to continue the baseball metaphor, they come out of left field. James adds an interesting epilogue in which Darcy explains some of his strange behavior in the earlier novel -- but much of the fascination of the original character is precisely that his moods can not be explained. Explanations of a mystery that do not satisfy or explanations of a romance that are not needed are really no explanations at all.n-law Georgiana being discreetly pursued by two rival suitors.

B004JZBGWI|5.0|I'm huge on staying organized, and I have lists everywhere for everything! I have one 'sticky note' for my groceries, one for my exercise schedule, one for budgeting, one for needed home repairs, and one 'to-do' list... with options for many more sticky notes. They all display on the same screen so I can look at them all at the same time. At the store, you can just touch an item on the grocery list and it crosses it off so you can still see the item on the list but know it's checked off. And you don't have to keep up with a paper list and a pen. I love it and am so glad I got it!!

0741470314|5.0|I am very grateful to Dr. Moriarty for writing such a detailed book about Sweet Michael! Whether or not you are a fan, this book will give you a much better idea of what His life was like. Dr. Moriarty researched well for this book and provides many glimpes into Michael's amazing life. There were a few times I had to stop reading and dry my eyes before continuing. I was not surprised by Michael's generosity and love for His fans, family, and people all over the world. It's who He was/is. He loved with abandon. He gave with ease. This book is a gift to to our community, and a must read for the entire world. Thank-you so much Dr. Moriarty. You are definately a soldier of love! peace, light & MichaeLove, E. M. Bx.

B001OSIV62|5.0|I imagine most people who achieve incredible goals must have some self-centered-ness.  Jobs. Gates.  This French-guy who walked across the World Trade Center on a wire in the mid 70's.<br /><br />\\"Man On Wire\\" is no different in that way.<br /><br />The film was gripping as we watch their plan unfold and reveal the details of this caper.  I was surprised how I felt worried for them even though we know it all happened.<br /><br />Another amazing thing is that they have film-quality footage of themselves when they were all young preparing for this caper.  It is fascinating to see them as young men and woman (just one) smiling and interacting as young college-aged adults and then talking and recalling their feelings 30-odd years later after the whole event.
B003HKN52U|5.0|As did I Tom Cruise did a hell of a job, Brad Pitt ??? okay, understand he hated the role? if true he did a good job reguardless, Anne Rice didn't think Cruise was the actor to play Lestat ! Tom Cruise can play anyone or anything, she did admit she was wrong and that was very good of her, me I just enjoyed the whole damn tale and liked Antonio Banderas too.
B0057MFA42|2.0|This is the best you will ever hear or see Nirvana. It's a shame that when the two are combined everything is completely out of sync. It's amazing to see Dave Grohl bringing his hands up to crash the cymbals when you've already heard the crash, or to hear Kurt Cobain start singing while he's still a few feet from the mic and hasn't opened his mouth yet. (And to clarify, I've tried all three included audio tracks, and they all have the same problem.)  I only gave it two stars rather than one because it's definitely quite playable as a live audio disc; the music all sounds spectacular on its own.  Long story short, as someone else already said, this Blu-ray is an A+ and an F at the same time. The audio and video are amazing; if only they could be synced up. This release is a travesty. Whoever mastered this and whoever gave the approval for the production should be fired, and it's incredibly disingenuous of UMG/Geffen to blame end users for these issues.  I've read that the DVD doesn't have these problems, but haven't been able to verify that on my own.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I am 70 now,been riding Lone Wolf for 52 years, this is one hell of a yarn and closer to the truth than most would imagine....Katey Segal is one hell of an underated actress so I commend her husband for writing this part for her,brings out her full potential, I'm a Scot and so I find it humorous you have a Limey playing a CA.Biker, but what the hell he doe's a damn fine job, their all good, I have ordered this from Amazon but haven't recieved it yet. People that I know that have looked at me as an abberation have come up and apologised. The greatness of Sutters writing is that he makes you both love and respect them as well as hate them and the truth is they simply measure humanity as a whole. I knew Ralph Barger lightly in the 60's always liked him, he was a great President of The Oakland Chapter H.A.'S a good man, was a shock to see him on the show, in my mind he's still that good looking young man of the 60's The Angels are poorer for him not representing them now.

For the first time in my life I am going to throw a book away so I don't subject anyone else to this drivel.  Utter rubbish, don't bother.  I just lost 3 days of my life.
B000MQ54OY|5.0|Well mine does anyway :) My daughter fell in love with a movie poster for Happy Feet 2, so I went ahead and purchased the movie. It came in no time, and the blu-ray edition looks so great on my tv that in some of the far away shots it actually looks like a bunch of penguins standing there. It is truly stunning. The movie is pretty cute too, even though as a parent with a great sense of humor I find myself laughing at the inneudo in most of the song choices.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is an amazing series ! Excellent special effects,and supurb character development. My only complaint is that it was too short !! How do we get more episodes. As they say in Texas--it is plumb good. and if you're not from Texas, sorry!!  Now as far as writing a long drawn-out review, I am not doing it--I told you all you need to know. This is a very good science fiction entertainment. I will not guarantee that you will like it-- life has risk--you spend your money, and you take your chances !! Do some research and make a decision. I did, and I liked the series !!

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I have never felt the need to review a book, but this series captivated me.  After greatly enjoying A Beautiful Disaster, Amazon recommended the Fifty trilogy.  I can't thank them enough.  As a Twilight fan, I could see the underlying similarities in the series, but Fifty held it's own.  James has a way with words, and though I found a few parts of the story frustrating, I couldn't put it down, and found myself desperate to see what happened next.  Well Done.<br /><br />Give this one a try.  It's worth the time.
031261246X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. As a technologist I know how hard it can be to describe technical issues and topics to non-technical people, especially in an entertaining and engaging way. Mark Russinovich is a not only an exceptional technical wizard but is also a great speaker who has brought his ability to entertain while informing to his writing. I can't wait to read his next book.
B000I186FW|1.0|The message of the movie could have been presented in a better fashion -- instead it was spun to be general liberal tripe. It is unfortunate that people hold this storyline to be something greater than it really is. As one reviewer put it, the movie isn't bad if you don't think about it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is very user friendly. There are about 100 different daily reading plans and it will read the Bible to you (and not in that boring computer voice!)  There is also a large selection of Bible versions. This is a must have for anyone wanting a mobile Bible.

This is a great live band (brilliant performers) with many profuse improvisations. Recommended if you like DP and the best classic Hard Rock.

B005FDWIGQ|3.0|So, I've seen all of the episodes of Breaking Bad up to this point and am a little confused. While it has good acting, there are some things that have been troubling me. First off, Walt has become an unlikeable character at this point. What was once a man who was all in it for 'fam' has now become this egotistical prick. I'm not gonna lie, I was actually rooting for Gus this season. How do the writers let that happen? Aren't you supposed to maintain some shred of sentiment towards the main character so that the viewers want to root for the protagonist and keep watching? And God, if they show one more scene of him walking away from a pending explosion I'm going to explode! They did that in the first season, so why recycle it in the 4th? I was so hoping he'd just die already. Though, I'm pretty sure that's coming soon. My main issue was after Walt has been so cautious about not being caught with Jesse. He not only shows up at the hospital and vocally makes himself noticed in front of the cops, but he also brings a bomb in with him! Uhhhh, so I guess it's safe to say that next season the cops will somehow mention this to Dean and he will get access to the hospital tapes and see his brother-in-law: live and in living color! Also, I don't understand why Jesse has lived this long.You mean to tell me that Walt has been able to geuss all and I do mean ALL of Gus's plans to undermine him but he couldn't lose this perpetual screw up? Jesse is the biggest testament to Walt's weakness. And while we are all humans who have our own weaknesses, this is uncharactersitic for a man who takes all these precautions to keep his 'other' life hidden. Jesse has always been a liability. From the first season of him revealing Walt's info to Krazy-8 to several other acts of semi-retardedness he's committed (hydrochloric acid in tub incident, drained battery, talking Tuco out of takiing the poison, etc) and trust me I do mean et cetera. Why is Walt so devoted to him? And don't say it was answered already because the answer he gave Gus is not backed up by the plot. When Gus posed the question to Walt I was actually on the edge of my seat and not because of the acting but because I really wanted to know, too. Having access to all of the information as audience members and still not being able to grasp the answer to that question beforehand is a poor storyline.  I understand that now they have been through so much they've become emotionally invested in each other but what I'm saying is that it should have never gotten to that point. Jesse has been more of a roadblock than endearing. He was an idiot almost the whole 2nd and 3rd season. There is no question about his stupidity in the first season. BUT NOW I GET IT! They have used Jesse as a writing crutch to spare the life of Walt and vise versa for the 4th season. Crutches have become a sort of visual symbol throughout this season with Walt, Jr., Dean, and now the actual plot! Well I'm growing tired of these crutches and can't wait for them to turn on each other. That is the only way this show will interest me again for season 5. It was the shows comparison to The Wire that brought me here. Now, the disappointing realization that it crumbles in comaprison is making me leave.

B0013527I4|5.0|Received this a few days after Christmas.  My grandson, son and myself have enjoyed watching this a few times.  Excellent - no problems
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its a fun app, don't get me wrong, but after a while, it gets dumb. other than that, it rocks!
B00005JNS0|5.0|Received this a few days before Christmas, made a good present for my little guy.  All my grandchildren have watched this a half dozen times..  No probems - Excellent
030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One is easily one of the most entertaining books I've read in years. It is a direct callback to everything that made my childhood wonderful.
B003L8EX0G|4.0|It's safe to say that the future of vocal jazz is safe in the hands of young artist like Ms. Yanofsky. She has chosen to learn from the best (Ella, Sarah and June) but has added her own youthful entusiasm and \\"spin\\" to well-known \\"classic\\" pop music. Her scatting is impeccable and she brings a very nice maturity to her singing. Definitely well worth checking out and keeping an eye on in the future.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I absolutely loved it but I was a bit disappointed with the end and a few minor details. Overall, this book is a must read! The ramifications of time travel made sense for the most part.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like this app because it has everything organized. Unlike a physical Bible, with the Bible app I can simply search a topic by finding the book and verse numbers. I also like that the version of the Bible can be changed. You can go from King James to The Message to compare verses or if you don't understand all that ye olde English. It does take a little time to load after you switch versions, however.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|I thought I'd be tired of this show by now since I typically get bored with most TV after about the 3rd or 4th season. Not so with Supernatural where the only dark moment was the beginning of Season 6 when Dean was busy trying to be a middle class white guy in suburbia. (So not you, Dean) Season 7 continues the saga while upping the stakes for the guys yet again. I miss Castiel, but not that much since the storyline he was such an integral part of has resolved--at least to some degree for now. You never know and that's the best thing about Supernatural, it combines common elements with fresh surprises every episode. Season 7 also sort of brings the regular cast back to their original roots of simply chasing monsters while staying one step ahead of their enemies. And I never get tired of that.
B0059M7ZVG|5.0|Bought this album on one of amazon's 1000 albums for $5 apiece deals and it turned out to be a great album.  Very good gothic metal.
B004SBX112|5.0|No ads but no dragon..angry.  this was going to be my birthday present!!!!  I better be compensated or it better show up soon<br /><br />*** Review Amended****  The game is great, but updates are NOT updated fast on Amazon.  If something new comes out, you better be ready to wait a day or two.. or five.  Same with updates.  Once it is on your kindle, it will update when it is available, but not until amazon deems it time to be available.  Makes you want to get an Ipad!
B001RP1G0U|5.0|This one is on a regular rotation at our house.  The spouse and I watch it 3-4 times a year.  Diane Lane has never been more beautiful, John Cusack has never been funnier, and they have great chemistry together.  The supporting cast has some impressive actors as well: the awesome Christopher Plummer, Elizabeth Perkins, Stockard Channing, a delightfully smarmy Dermot Mulroney, and some of the cutest dogs in cinema.  You really can't go wrong.  I know this movie so well I can recite some of the dialogue and will laugh before the punch lines.  It is simply a feel-good story.  I love the dynamic of Sarah's family - they gather around when times are hard, they don't take themselves or each other too seriously, but they have that foundation of love.  Everybody wants a family like that.  I like to think my family is like that.  The dialogue is really good and always manages to hit the right notes.  There is a fair amount of talk today among professional movie critics to the effect that no one makes a good romantic comedy any more.  It's easy to make a bad one.  The plots are all similar, and a subpar script can make even an excellent actor look bad.  Must Love Dogs has good actors and a great script.  It's not the greatest movie ever made but it's my favorite romantic comedy.  And my husband likes it too!
B002O3Z50G|5.0|This is a great \\"disaster\\" film & goes well with Dante's Peak, Volcano, Towering Inferno & Day After Tomorrow. There are several actors you recognize (much younger than they are now) who have gone on to being recognized for their talent & receiving Oscar Nominations (Seymor Phillip Hoffman is one).  The special effects are pretty good & shows just how devastating Tornados can be.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm would recommend this app to my friends its fun kinds addictive but over all u should get it. And its free!!!!
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|If you love the Killers, it is likely because of the killer voice of Brandon Flowers. Nothing great about the Killers is lost on this album in my opinion. He still has that great voice that makes you smile, the fabulous electric pop sound that keeps your arms up, and beats that spur movement! I listen to it when I workout or when I'm driving. Now, some of the songs are more lulling in pace compared to what the Killers produced, but all the soul and sound is there, so those are the best parts for me.  \\"On the Floor\\" has a good 'ol Vegas/Elvis vibe, but it is really slow and introspective, whereas \\"Magdelena\\" is more upbeat and has a similar feel to \\"I Can't Stay\\" from the Killers' album Day & Age, with all its southwest-Mex imagery.  Now there have been many a time when I like an artist because I have heard a couple of his or her songs on the radio, so I go for the album only to be disappointed that out of 10 or so songs, the two I heard on the radio are the only ones that I really liked, but that is NOT the case here. Unlike those other artist's solo albums, you will like many of the songs on Flamingo- I strongly dislike the name \\"Flamingo,\\" but absolutely love the songs! Check it out and enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an amazing game i play it all the time! me and my friends compete for high scores on the games we have!
B005LJK3AC|2.0|Only made it through 20 minutes of this filthy mess of a trashy romp, and only because my wife wanted to see it. If you want to see incredibly good actors saying and doing impossibly stupid things, this is your bag of crapola for sure. I am no puritan, and can appreciate a well done movie no matter what the subject matter is. This is just swearing and sexual innuendo for the sake of shock and laughs, although there's no humor to be derived from this joke of a film. Got 2 stars because Jennifer looks absolutely stunning. The writers of this should be flogged for thrusting this on the public. The majority of US movie goers are dense, no arguing that, but not dense enough to devour this. Forget it!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I saw this series on TV, and enjoyed it so much I bought it for my sister for Christmas.  Don't know if she has actually watched it yet.  It was very informative and I enjoyed it very much.
0307891372|5.0|Great price, shipped quickly and considering i couldn't find one locally, it was the icing on the cake! It's very helpful those times when you just get stuck, or you can't chose which side to go with, and instead of saving and doing it again the other way you can know which ways the best outcome for you.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. It's cool the way it can be customized for my own preferences. I always have to win the game before I can quit playlng it.
0789318245|1.0|the cover looks awesome, but this book is full of crude doodlings.  i thought it would have lots of old school flash- and it does have some but most is scary looking.  some of the text is semi-interesting, but you don't buy this kind of book for the text.  you buy this kind of book for the art work and flash- which is really bad IMO.  85% of the flash is crude, bland, boring, poorly drawn, or just in bad taste.  to top it off, many of the pics are blurry.  it's like they didn't even try to hide that they just did a google search for \\"old school tats\\" and pasted it in a book.  i feel ripped off, what a waste of money.
0345528581|3.0|I don't understand all the 5 star ratings.If anyone has ever tried a PT type workout they don't need this book.It seems every 4 or 5 years a Navy Seal tries to come out as a fitness writter.Ok ,we all know diet and exercise will produce results.I don't care if it's bodyweight routines or free weights or machines.  You can get all of these ideas on the internet free.Youtube has tons of Bootcamp workouts.I bought this based on customer reviews and was not happy.All anyone needs to do is set of a routine using pushups,crunches ,pullups,chins,bodyweight squats,dips etc use reps ranges you can handle and increase weekly and you will see your body change.I also disagree with Mark's view on no running.If you add a 2 to 3 mile jog 3 times a week you can and WILL lose fat and weight.I dropped 50 pounds using a bodyweight routine and have kept it off for 2 years.I also think lifting weights is needed to build mass.I like to switch it up every 3 months between Bodyweight and free weight routines.I think Crossfit style routines are the future of fitness.They are a mix of both.One last thing ,I would never do chins on a door or hang from a door knob to exercise!!!
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I can't remember the time I read a book as good as this one.  I was literally reading every spare second I had in the day.  I couldn't put this book down.  I just kept wondering what was real and what was not.  Christine, the main character, has condition where she can't remember anything that has happened to her once she falls asleep.  She starts to keep a journal so she can put things together and that's when the fun begins.  You're never quite sure what to believe and it keeps you reading and wondering.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.  EXCELLENT READ!
B000H6SXMY|5.0|I ordered this item with little time for xmas. I had little hope it would get there on time with standard shipping, but it got there and I couldn't be happier for the quick response time. THANKS.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|This is a great app!  That should get a 5 star rating. except for 2, what I consider BIG flaws.  The first being that it only works when you are connected to the Internet.  Having a multi-version Bible at my fingertips during service was the whole reason I got a Kindle in the fist place! But we do not have wi-fi so this app is completely useless at church.  Second is it does not work in conjunction with my dictionary like an e-book Bible does.  If there is a word I don't understand the meaning of I can't just touch on it and havethe definition show up.  I think this is a HUGE oversite for this app &amp; I rally hope it is improved. upon.  BUT!  If you want multiple  versions (100's of them) in one spot while you r online..this is the app for you!  Also...I really do enjoy the reading plans that it offers .
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app it is so fun and so addicting I play it all the time!!!  it has so many fun games!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is awesome and very addictive.  The games start out easy but get more challenging as u open more.  A lot of fun.
B0063GORYU|4.0|spider solitaire is fun and challenging. every game is different. the challenge keeps it more exciting. definitely one of my favorites.
0062101897|5.0|The book i purchasedfor my daughter is so beautifully done, the pictures are amazing and there is so much information in it. She thought she would be through it in a few days but she just keeps going back to it. I highly recommend this book as any Harry Potter fan will love it.[[ASIN:0062101897 Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey]]
0670022411|4.0|I was immediately drawn in.  The writing is interesting and the book is well paced.  The author does a fantastic job of providing just the right amount of information to make you think ahead and ask the questions she plans to answer.  I found the connection to history and science intriguing; however, I didn't get down into the details of those areas or find glaring errors as others claim.  I took the information at face value and will research accordingly, if needed.  Sometimes, my reading friends, we have to take a leap of faith and even suspend reality.  May I remind you our main characters are a witch and a 1,500 year-old vampire...we may need to lighten up a bit.  Unfortunately, the last 25% of the book left a lot of unanswered questions, but I hope this was the intent.  I need some answers!  This is not a cliffhanger ending as some claim, but closure of one chapter in the adventure and a prelude to the next.  For those who felt slighted, I think sour grapes are not in order just yet since this is a planned trilogy.  I gave it four stars because I didn't connect with Diana.  I had a few hang-ups with her which I hope will be resolved in the next book.  I was put off a time or two by some of her silly reactions and comments.  This wasn't something that kept me from enjoying the book, far from it, but it did flavor my opinion of the book overall.  If you enjoy modern literature with a supernatural twist, I highly recommend this book.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|I LOVED it!  My favorite parts were in the last half, but I LOVED Ana standing up for herself and learning to have better control over her body!  Also, LOVED the last 2 chapters told from Fifty's perspective as others have mentioned, I wanted MORE!!!  I, too, wouldn't mind reading the series again from his perspective.  So good!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. I use this at church a lot. I recommend using this app. I also have this app on my cell phone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great set of games some work better than others but still fun and worth a free app I personally enjoy working towards aa new game
B0055SWM08|5.0|Playing this game puts me into a trance-like state of utter tranquility.  It's a nice way to get recentered in the middle of a hectic day.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Great movie! Loved the story line and great acting by many talented people. It is a very emotional movie, it will make you cry and laugh.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I found this whole series of Hunger Games books to be a bit repetitive. The series is entertaining and a fun and easy read. I was however a bit shocked to read that Ms. Collins' father was all about peace, ant-war, and she wrote these books to help support the idea of peace. Additionally, it appears her target audience is the teen population, hence Katniss's age.  I find these books to be pretty violent and full of death, not to mention completely unrealistic. If real life human beings had gone through even just a small amount of the trauma these characters experienced even in one of these three books, they would be mired in the world of PTSD, not to mention traumatic brain injury issues. I just sort of find it pretty ironic that author claims to have been writing to support peace, yet it appears that one can go to war, suffer greatly, and then come out on the other side to have fulfilling relationships albeit some nightmares. This is not really the message of peace, non-violence, anti-war to me. Perhaps including some technology that could remove the impact of the trauma would have solved this dilemma for me or perhaps making Katniss end up in an aslyum of sorts would have worked.  Anyway, go ahead and read it and pretend you are the winner here.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Love the movie, but if you are going to advertise something as containing a digital copy you shouldn't sell ones where the codes are expired. You can do better than this, Amazon.com.
B006VRZ5YM|2.0|Used to a rated R on a romcom meant some racy bedroom scenes and some adult language. In the last few years it means the raunchiest forms of sexual humor the writers can drum up - as in junior high locker room level and worse. The main character, as portrayed as raised by upper society Bostonians, was a completely unbelievable back story given the character's portrayal as essentially a very crude minded slut - but of course one with a good heart (presumably that makes any character palatable for us to identify with).<br /><br />Anna Faris has definite potential as a comedic actress, but even if she was cast into higher quality material than this film, I'll always be tainted by the characterization she portrayed here (ugh). It was her career choice, of course.<br /><br />Wife and I agreed we couldn't recommend this movie to anyone we know. And we're giving up completely on any romcom movie that is rated R.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this app! the games are really random but a lot of fun!!! I would recommend everyone try it for a little while before ruling it out
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Was absolutely thrilled to find this among the free offerings for Kindle! I am between apartments just now and all of my books are in storage, so I was bummed that I didn't get to do my yearly reading last month. I just bought my Kindle a couple weeks ago so I got to do it after all, I little late, but better than nothing!  This is such an amazing story that is still relevant today. It never fails to warm the heart and bring about the realization of what Christmas is supposed to be.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|A really good app, easy to pull out different translations quickly. What I like most is the Bible can be read offline.  What I don't like is that to make notes you need to have a wifi connection.  Search function also depends on having a wifi conection is also a very painful process. Would have given a 5* if not for this.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this. game is really fun.it's. a great. time. waster. the controls are a difficult. occasionally it will freeze up,butcim not sure that's because of the game.

B006W0QOF2|5.0|So I've repeatedly asserted the greatness that is Ryan Gosling. His unvarnished acting chops can be seen in such great films as Half Nelson and Lars and the Real Girl. But the sexy Canadian was never more great than in his starring role in DRIVE. You have got to see this movie. Everyone from Albert Brooks to Ron Pearlman to yep, Brian Cranston are superb in this gritty and deeply disturbing thriller but Ryan, oh Ryan, he is a master, a savant, a brilliant actor that draws you into this character from the very first whispered scene to the last gasp of blood everything about Ryan's performance in this movie is brilliant. As with all great actors all the action happens in what he DOESN'T SAY, rather than what he does. The scene after the pawn shop robbery when he locks the hotel door and puts on his gloves and then turns to the girl and says, \\"I'm going to ask you some questions...\\" Oh My! Reminds me of the scene when Al Pacino sits in the armchair and tells his brother that he'll meet with Salazzo and says, \\"I'll kill them both...\\" Man Drive just went on my top ten list. YOU MUST SEE THIS FILM!!! I suspect it's a film that Quentin wishes he could do it's as brilliant as Quentin without all the useless pithy dialogue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is easy to unlock games. its a lot of fun for all ages. keeps even young ones engaged.

0307592731|5.0|The subject line is Doug Peacock's title to his memoir [[ASIN:0910055998 Walking It Off: A Veteran's Chronicle of War and Wilderness]] on overcoming his \\"Post Traumatic Stress Disorder\\" after the Vietnam War. He took to the wilderness, and long hikes. Peacock served as the model for George Washington Hayduke in Edward Abbey's environmental classic [[ASIN:0061129763 The Monkey Wrench Gang (P.S.)]]. PSTD can take many forms, and one does not need to go to war to be so afflicted. An abusive father, who absences himself from his parental duties far too early, and a mother who dies from cancer, also, far too early, can leave one grasping for the illusionary safety ring of a \\"Leave It to Beaver\\" upbringing. A marriage, also to use the same phrase, far too early, did not provide it. And heroin and too many mindless, anonymous couplings proved to be failed grasps at obtaining self-esteem. A chance glance in a bookstore provided the opportunity for a sense of accomplishment and achievement that might provide it though. Cheryl Strayed (the last name she assumed for herself, after her divorce, underscore her wayward path) sought salvation on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), and largely found it.<br /><br />Strayed commenced her solo hike in June, 1995, in the Mojave Desert. Her original objective was the Oregon state line. She was abysmally unprepared, physically, or mentally, for the challenges ahead. There were no three to five day preliminary hikes to break in her body and her equipment. She went \\"heavy,\\" save for the proverbial \\"kitchen sink.\\" But she had that gritty \\"make it or break it\\" determination, and whereas many in her situation would have quickly made alliances, of one sort or the other, with fellow hikers, and although she did not eschew the occasional camaraderie with them, by and large, she hiked it by herself. She was almost always flat broke. It was a year of very heavy snowfalls during the previous winter in the Sierra Nevada, and much of the trail was socked in, to all but the very heartiest of hikers. By far, most skipped that portion, as did Strayed, but she decided to make up for it by hiking all of Oregon instead.<br /><br />Strayed met a couple bad people along the way, but was fortunate (lucky!) to stay out of harm's way. Mainly though, it was the kindness of strangers she encountered, which helped her through. Strayed is no naturalist, and thus lyrical passages on the beauty of the natural world are largely missing. And this is hardly a \\"how-to\\" guide to the PCT. But one can learn a lot of how-not-to, and that is just as valuable. Sin and redemption, rather than the trail itself is the central theme, and the hike is laced with flashbacks from her earlier life, much of which I found fascinating, having once had connections with Minnesota, and the \\"back to the land\\" survivalist efforts. The PCT provides a strong narrative thread; she writes well, with a lively pace and I found it hard to put down.<br /><br />The author wrote this book 17 years after the events, so there is naturally some skepticism as to the authenticity of the dialogue. There were no stunning \\"bon mots\\" or deep insights into the human condition; and to a large measure it reflects her self-absorption.  She never discusses how memory might play tricks on you after 17 years, and although she cites at the beginning that her personal journals were sources, one wonders how thorough they could be after an exhausting day on the trail. I found myself pondering what might have been embroidery for the sake of a good story, and what was authentic. Like Charlie Brown, Lucy has fooled me before, but overall, after what I consider to be a balanced judgment, it rings authentic and true, and a remarkable achievement. Furthermore, the \\"thumb on the scale\\" was that she has done it; I haven't, and thus the book is, if nothing else, an inspirational goad. Also, of the books she toted, I placed two on my must read list, [[ASIN:0393310337 The Dream of a Common Language:Poems 1974-1977]] and [[ASIN:159017013X The Ten Thousand Things]].  5-stars.159017013X The Ten Thousand Things]].  5-stars.

B0069UV0LS|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />The late screen writing guru, Blake Snyder, came out with a book a few years ago, entitled 'Save the Cat'. He argued that a successful screenplay should contain a 'Save the Cat' moment at the beginning of a script, where the hero ingratiates his audience through a humanitarian gesture (it could involve helping a person or even an animal; hence the term, 'save the cat'). Newcomer writer/director Paddy Considine turns Snyder's advice on its head by offering up the opposite: a 'Kill the Dog' moment. Rather than feeling sympathy for the protagonist, Considine seeks to alienate the audience from his protagonist and is quite successful--I can't recall a film in recent memory where not only one, but two dogs are actually killed by the film's protagonist.<br /><br />My pet peeve with 'independent' films these days, is that many protagonists don't like themselves. I call them 'sad sacks'. They're the type of characters that don't make for good drama, since their egos are weak, are always down on themselves, and have little or no charm. Considine's 'Tyrannosaur' goes a step further by offering up Joseph, the unemployed North England widower, who has a perpetual anger management problem. When he meets domestic violence victim, Hannah, who runs a charity shop, his harsh words toward her, are a very hard draught to take.<br /><br />Nonetheless, there is an even more despicable character than Joseph and that's Hannah's husband, James, the ultimate abusive husband. James' character is designed to shock as he's seen returning home one night, intoxicated, and ends up urinating over Hannah while she sleeps. He later rapes her and she reveals that he's placed shards of glass in her private parts in the past, causing her to become infertile. While the domestic violence scenes are admittedly powerful, they are also wholly manipulative, since James is merely a one-dimensional monster. It would have been much more difficult for Considine to humanize his villain. This also holds true for his secondary characters, the skinheads who live across from Joseph, who are also perpetually angry, and are not above goading a dog to attack a child.<br /><br />Considine attempts to humanize Joseph a bit as he ultimately softens up in his relation to Hannah. But in a cruel twist of fate-SPOILERS AHEAD-Hannah is jailed for murdering her abusive husband. While Joseph pays his respects at a funeral for a friend and visits Hannah in prison at film's end, this seems to indicate that he's 'cleaned up his act' somewhat; but is it enough to forgive him for past transgressions? Some would say, given his background, 'yes'. But to my mind, the horrible killing of the two dogs, is enough to reject Joseph out of hand. There are many people who had horrendous childhoods or difficult lives, who don't end up killing defenseless animals and subjecting others to continuous, psychotic outbursts. Considine seems to argue that characters like Joseph, should be given a 'free pass'; or perhaps people should be 'understanding', given the environment these characters come from.<br /><br />There are occasional strong moments in 'Tyrannosaur', especially the aforementioned domestic violence scenes. But there were some characters who were too one-dimensional (such as James) and others like Joseph, who I was inclined to have little sympathy for. Only Olivia Colman's performance as the brutalized Hannah, proved to be compelling and saved the film from a total unpleasant aftertaste. With so many films on the market, investing oneself in Joseph's journey, is not one I would care to take again.also holds true for his secondary characters, the skinheads who live across from Joseph, who are also perpetually angry, and are not above goading a dog to attack a child.

0385736002|4.0|Reading this book lead me to Scott's others in the series. Fantastic plot. It sets the stage beautifully for all that came afterward. For me it was a page turner. In reading this as a writer and then the following books, The Alchemist clearly showed how to lay a base that can explode in even better, later work. As somehow who has worked extensively with teens, I can see how they would be enthralled.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Everything you would want.  Various reading plans.  A plethora of translations.  You can highlight important passages in a variety of ways.  It has definitely helped me in my Bible readings.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great deal. My kids proceeded to watch every movie within three days of receiving them. It's great to have them on Blu Ray so the picture is sharp and clear. Makes for the best viewing.

0385342063|4.0|When you read a Sophie Kinsella novel, you go into it knowing that the story will be hilarious and a little over the top and totally unbelievable. That is part of the fun! Her heroines usually get into embarrassing scrapes and ridiculously humorous situations and while the plot at times stretches plausibility, it makes for enjoyable reading. With I've Got Your Number, I found myself laughing out loud or smiling much of the time.  There were a couple of things that I didn't like that detracted slightly from my enjoyment of the book. Poppy is supposed to be a physiotherapist but she doesn't spend much time at work. She sometimes comes across as a little flaky (typical for Kinsella's heroines) but you'd think Poppy would be written as a more intelligent character. Perhaps the reason she appears this way is in part due to the inferiority she feels next to her fiance Magnus or his family.  The other thing that bothered me were the footnotes which got to be annoying after awhile. Some readers could probably just ignore them but I found I couldn't. Still, these are just minor things and some of the footnotes are quite funny.  I liked Poppy as a character. She is caring and creative and even though she has that inferiority complex, I think that makes her easier to relate to. Sam annoyed me a little bit at times because he could be cold and aloof with his employees but I think Poppy was a good influence on him. Sam makes quite a positive contrast compared to Magnus. I enjoyed the development of their relationship and the funny texts back and forth between them.  Overall, I thought this was a great book for a cold winter day. The short chapters and humor made it a quick read. After her Becky Bloomwood books, this is my favorite and I certainly liked it more than Mini Shopaholic. I'd suggest this to fans of Kinsella's other books and readers of chick lit in general. Pick it up when you are in the mood for something light that will make you laugh out loud.  Readalikes: WeddingGirl by Madeleine Wickham (Sophie Kinsella's real name), The Sleeping Beauty Proposal by Sarah Strohmeyer, Forget Me Knot by Sue Margolis

B004EPZ03O|1.0|This week the Muppets has been released in Germany and I really wished I had read some reviews before. So, watching this film, it became a sad afternoon. After 45 minutes we left the cinema and we weren't the first but the last people who fled the movie let alone two spectators.  Happend 19th january 2012 in UCI Colosseum (a Movie palace in Berlin)  ...argue about facts?
B003VANOFY|5.0|The sound on the microphone and headset are second to none - I use this not only for gaming and entertainment, but for VOIP calls using Zoiper biz. The only negative I have for this product is that the headset feels large on you, and can get a little warm on extended use - not from the device but from the retained body heat inside the ear pieces.  Definitely worth the money.
0307891402|3.0|The book was great, my boyfriend love it! The only problem is that the map they send you with it is crappy.  The creases came ripped where the creases met and continuously ripped more and more each time it was opened.  We had to tape all the creases in order to stop the damage, however it included every single location which is nice.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|a third of the way into death comes to pemberly i have to ask, why bother? why bother continuing to read this unconvincing, thinly plotted, sloppily executed book and more importantly, why did james bother to write something so obviously beneath her abilities? Aside from what one might feel about honoring or dishonoring Austen's original, the present author's the total disregard of conventions appropriate to the date of her story are preposterous and distracting. Policeman in 1803 enters aristocratic household to investigate and interrogate? forensic methods that were cutting edge 100 years later but unheard of at the time this story is set? seriously? it's a foolish book and far far beneath the talents of james or austen.

B006IGZWB2|4.0|Entertaining movie about living in Mississippi in an era of racial oppression. What makes the movie good is the comical element of the movie that keeps it funny with a hint of seriousness. Highly recommend this!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Alright, first off, the only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five is because I haven't used it yet. It seems like a great sharpener right off the bat. It has a carbide groove for rough or dull knives (straight edge,) just to hone into the right shape, and then a ceramic groove for fine sharpening to put the finished edge on your blade.  I'm assuming that it works well, and if it doesn't then I'll change my review. The other nice thing about this sharpener is the flip-out diamond rod.  The rod can can be to sharpen single-beveled edges the old-fashioned way if that's how you prefer to do it, but it can also be used to to sharpen serrated edges and gut-hooks.  I'm sure if you are willing to put the time into it, this little tool can be used to put a nice, sharp edge on anything (even an axe; although a grinding wheel would be more optimal for a tool of that size.) I have a folding Gerber knife upstairs with a partially serrated blade that I will test this thing out on a little later. I'll update my review after using this to see how effective each aspect of this tool is (I believe this tool was made with knives like that in mind.) My Gerber is rather dull on the straight section of the blade, so I'll be able to use the carbide groove, the ceramic groove, and I'll even try out the rod on the serrations (even though they're still pretty sharp,) but a good review is an informed one, and I think I owe you that much. As for construction and quality, everything seems pretty solid, and this tool is small enough to fit into just about any pocket you can have, so its extremely portable as well. I'll update after trying it out, and tell you what kind of edge I get on my Gerber.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|But of course, there are ads. BUT IT'S FREE, SO DON'T COMPLAIN. Great graphics, too. What can I say? The popular games usually win. (sometimes)
B005CKPQHA|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Breaking Bad, and Season 4 blew my mind.  I cannot recommend it strongly enough.  I have several of the other seasons on DVD, but got Season 4 via Amazon Streaming.  Very easy to use, very good quality video.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I went from 122 to 114 in about 6 weeks doing 30 Day Shred M-Th, No More Trouble Zones (also Jillian) Sat, and rest on Sunday. I have never been in such good shape and have arms I didn't think were possible!<br /><br />**Tips for beginners**<br />1.  Your first goal should be to finish the workout. Nothing is more deflating then to get all excited about a new exercise routine and crash and burn on the first day. You are much less likely to stick with it if you feel like a failure off the bat, so take it easy at first. It is better to go 50% and finish the workout then to blow through half the workout at 100%. Go as easy as you need to, but never stop a workout once you start. The psychological difference is huge.<br /><br />2. My calves were so sore after the first time it took me 3 days to recover. The second time I restarted the program I was smarter. Err on the side of caution and back off if you feel burning during the jump rope or jumping jacks. Again, you want to finish the tape and be well enough to repeat the next day.<br /><br />3.  There is no time for drink breaks by design; if you feel thirsty during a half hour workout you aren't drinking enough water during the day.<br /><br />I have also recently started a newer Jillian DVD, Ripped in 30, but will hold off on the review until I complete a cycle. So far it is comparable to Shred and a nice change.<br /><br />Good luck and happy sweating!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|I cannot recommend Breaking Bad strongly enough, and Season Four even more.  This was my first experience with Amazon streaming, and it worked great!  Love this show.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|I purchased the app so that I can view password protected PDF files.  I get the screen prompting me to enter the password, but when I tap on it, I do not get a keyboard pop up to type it in.  I just spent 15 bucks for nothing.  I am very disappointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! I love being able to switch between versions while reading the passages. I'm very thankful for the plans, too!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I haven't had any of the problems others have been discussing. there are ads but not as often as some reviews say. Some of the games are really addicting!
0446573019|5.0|I think the reviews are spot on.  The Puller does remind me of Reacher, but that isn't a bad thing.  I enjoyed both characters and I am glad I have read many books from both authors.  Zero Day has a great new character for Baldacci to write about, and he does an excellent job creating Puller.<br /><br />5 stars
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Fun basic game. can be more rewarding if you did not have to wait for score to be added up.keep it up!
B0055SWM08|5.0|can't put it down!!! most addictive game ever, and very challenging, despite it's simplicity. would have gladly paid for it.
0385342039|5.0|Sometimes a light, fun book is just what is needed to restore your faith in the world.  Twenties Girl was, for me, a laugh out loud, smile and giggle kind-of-book, filled with charming delights.  I found myself rummaging around London, dressed in beads with a ghost on my shoulder as the chapters passed with ease.  Charming and fun!  I really enjoyed it and would recommend it highly.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Great movie - wonderful sights of Paris to start off the story and then the inclusion of all those famous folks - Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald and more - a travel back in time - plan to watch it many times to capture Woody Allen's humor and depth of story line.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app has really helped me get into the word on my mobile, kindle, Pc...anywhere! It has great features for bookmarks, sharing etc... Its a must have!
B005MYEPXC|1.0|First, the acting is terrible...TERRIBLE. Second..the story didn't take me anywhere...i felt as if I was watching a boring high school theater act. Thirdly, ending was weird and sucked. Fourthly, if they thought it's a comedy, the humor was not existent.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Great movie. The entire cast acting was Outstanding. This DVD will be a cherised addition to my collection of movies worth keeping for posterity.
B004EPZ06G|3.0|Even though you pretty much can guess what's coming next in the movie it was still worth the $ to see it.

B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire on kindle fire is great. it gives you many options and is good company. it helps me unwind. I highly suggest it, keeps your mind sharp.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|A great way to take notes and have them available across multiple devices and locations. It has replaced any other note-taking apps I've tried. My only gripe is that I'd like it to have a robust undo. On my phone, there's a key combine that can easily (and inadvertantly) select all text. Of course, the next key press overwrites it all. No problems on my Kindle Fire.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have enjoyed the different Bible versions along with the devotional plans. I would recommend this to everyone. It is awesome!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game , the thing that I don't like that before you play a game it does not give you the instructions but I know what to do after a while BTW I love this game.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|See title. It is dumb that every time you open it you must say you will or wont rate it.
B001H1WXWO|3.0|It's a good movie in general, but a simple story with too much details about violences one after another. Even the romance part is shot in uncomfortable background and darkness. I would expect it to be told differently, in a more normal daily life way, and it could make the argument more powerful regarding a girl wanting to be a boy ending up in death. it seems all the other charactors besides Teena are already troubled souls (simple mothers, fights in the bars, getting theirselves in trouble all the time, making silly decisions etc). This makes me wondering if this is really the case in the middle America which I know little about (would appreciate if someone tells me).  If this is the case, brutal crimes would be there with or without Teena.  Hillary performed perfect. This is not a mainstream story and I guess Acadamy would not give her a recognition for this role.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Going to the noon showing . . . won't get any sleep tonight!!!  OMG . . . So pumped up for this!!!  Don't spoil this for me, thank you.
0812992792|5.0|When I started reading this book, I wondered if it was science fiction, where I was taken to this \\"Big Brother\\" planet where a society totally lives in fear under the rule of a madman. It has hard to digest that this was an actual place on earth at this time and age. It is about life in North Korea and a character named Pak Jun Do.  We begin by meeting Pak Jun Do at an orphanage that his father works at. Being an orphan is considered being one of the lowliest persons alive. Although Pak Jun Do's father works there, everyone he meets thinks he is an orphan and immediately forms their opinion about him.  We follow Jun Do through his unbelieveable and haunting life where he seems to be the puppet of those above him. He is forced to become a kidnapper, an intelligence officer that lives on a fishing boat, a prisoner, and eventually tortured. Throughout this, he has one thing to cling to, his love for the national actress, Sun Moon. We do not know his original name, but then he becomes Jun Do in the orphanage and then becomes others as the book progresses. In a society where you can \\"replace\\" a husband, or a wife, etc., and accept that as reality, Jun Do becomes who he needs to be when he needs to be.  I am so fortunate to have received an advanced copy of this book. I do not think it is a book I would have picked up on my own to read. Once I started reading, I was hooked. The author weaves Jun Do's different lives in and out of one another, and jumps from the present to the past and back again. It was confusing in the beginning, but once I figured out what was going on, it made the journey more interesting.  It really opened my eyes to the injustices that are occuring in North Korea and makes me thankful that I live in America. I would encourage others to read this book so they, too, can learn about life in North Korea
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This is a truly remarkable book, which I appreciated for several reasons. On one hand it's a precious resource for aspiring authors. Stephen King does a very good job at sharing his experience as a writer, without ever coming out as patronizing. I particularly liked the fact that he really focuses on the fundamentals of good writing, but doesn't impose on the reader a heavy and rigid academic process. On the other hand, the book draws a very engaging and intimate portrait of a man who went through a lot of personal and professional crisis, and shows how much they shaped him and his work. I absolutely loved every page.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|My daughter has had the Kinect since May.  In the 14' x 14' room, it was not possible to play the games with two people. We purchased the Zoom for Christmas and it worked immediately, without even moving the Kinect camera.  She's delighted that she can play along with her friends now.  Great product.  It's easy to install and worth the price when using the Kinect in small spaces.
0553584537|5.0|This book is excellent! It is hard to put down, she can really tell a story. Then as you near the end, you hate to finish it! Well worth your time!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|fast paced,like the movement of cards, and the option to compete with other players. like the ability to play other solitaire games as well
B001BPQT8A|1.0|I am beyond disappointed with this, received it Monday and it's a great little package for a great movie, but it doesn't work at all. No playback on my sony blu ray player, and invalid disc on my PS3. Sending this one back to amazon immediately, as many others below have said. I'll get something else instead
B006BDHAX0|3.0|Very frustrating when you've almost completed the game and then it shuts down.  This happens quite often.  I have the game installed on my Fire.

0739383728|1.0|Pheidippides died from exhaustion right after telling the Athenians that the  Greeks had defeated the Persian invaders in the very first marathon, which happened four centuries B.C.  Noted joggers Jim Fixx and the USA Olympic committee member, (the man who was actress Grace Kelly's brother) both died prematurely after finishing their daily jogs. Jogging reduces the capacity for pumping blood through your arteries, a very sobering thought, which has been well explained in Dr. Al Sears's book on \\"progressively accelerating cardiopulmonary exertion.\\"  Christopher McDougall probably means well, but his paean to marathon running could very well kill you instead.  Olympic sprinters are all muscular, athletic-looking people; but marathoners all look like skinny beanpoles. Ask yourself why .....  Caveat lector.

0545123275|5.0|I really liked this book, there was a bit of poetry which gives the story and characters depth. I like it more than Twilight, although I can tell it is somewhat a spin off on the series, except without vampires...which is great, because I love werewolves so much more.
0062082353|5.0|I pre-ordered and finished reading the book before all of the negative reviews started pouring in.  Some of the bad reviews had some decent points, but, come on, give the guy a break! Unless you had \\"been there, done that\\" then shut the heck up! No one forced you to complete the book. If you saw that you weren't enjoying the book, just close it, put in down, and \\"case closed\\"! Everyone knows that you take a gamble on ordering books on-line, especially if there are no prior reviews, which in this case, there were not .<br /><br />  I served in the Marines (mid 80's) and really appreciated Chris Kyle's positive evaluation of Marines (and even soldiers, on occasions) all throughout the book. He didn't put himself upon a pedestal, like some of the reviewers claim. Heck, he's a SEAL, he has every right to be a little cocky!<br /><br />  Kyle makes a good point when he said that the reason that he doesn't feel any guilt when he has a confirmed kill, is because most of the bad guys were intent on killing themselves in the process anyway (suicide bombers, etc...) So why not go ahead and do them a favor a little sooner, while also saving lives of fellow Americans and innocent civilians?<br /><br />  Kyle , throughout the book, reminds the reader that he is not the best sniper in the world, far from it. He was just in the \\"hot seat\\" quite often, which results in higher #'s of kills.<br /><br />  I also enjoyed Kyle reminding me that some things never change, such as weak C.O's, the \\"hurry up and wait\\", and especially lying recruiters!<br /><br />  The controversy on whether or not he 'decked\\" Jesse Ventura..., well, to me, the jury is still out. I've seen Kyles interviews discussing it on YouTube, and I also have heard Ventura's side, also. Ventura is so strung out from all the \\"juice\\" he has injected over the years (check out his prior incidents and comments on everything from UFO's to politics), that I am really leaning toward believing Kyle, the only reason I think it might not be true is that I am surprised that it wasn't brought to ones attention (back in 2006). By the way, I'm not all that sure you can call Ventura an actual SEAL, but that's another story).<br /><br />  The biggest fault I could find with the book is that Kyle's story did jump around quite alot, making it sometimes hard to follow, and there were alot of blank spaces on every page, making it a quick read although it has close to 400 pages.<br /><br />  Unless one actually knows a few SEALs to back up some of the events in this book, or if some actual SEALs would give us some reviews here on Amazon.com, we can't really comment on whether or not Chris Kyle is \\"full of it\\" as some suggest.<br /><br />  His two Silver Stars, along with several more medals, should tell most of us, especially anyone who served in the military, that he ,in fact, has \\"BEEN THERE, DONE THAT\\"!t brought to ones attention (back in 2006). By the way, I'm not all that sure you can call Ventura an actual SEAL, but that's another story).

B002OPZ37E|5.0|Man...I haven't been happy with a CD purchase in months! This whole album is amazing, it's so unique, I haven't heard anyone like them.
B004J80CXE|3.0|This review is for the K2HD version. As noone has yet to post a review of this CD and given it's price I felt compelled to do so. As I said I have mixed feelings about this disc, made and mastered in Japan.<br /><br />First the good. The sound quality is exceptional. I have a high end system that reproduces the nuances of this disc very well. I think to truly appreciate the sonics of this disc one will need a very resolving playback system. That doesn't mean it won't sound good on any system. It's just the better the system the more one will be able to appreciate it's sonics. I have been auditioning some of the higher resolution discs as of late and have been quite impressed with many of the formats such as K2, DXD, and Utra HD. (The sound of the Ultra HD format is extraordinary BTW.) This disc provides outstanding details without being bright. The overall sound is warm and smooth and subtleties are very well expressed. Much closer to the \\"analog\\" sound so many audiophiles desire than what your typical redbook CD provides. If your looking for exceptional sound quality this disc certainly provides it. Another positive is it includes all of the lyrics to all of the songs and it all comes in a very nice \\"book like\\" package. Also this isn't simply a remaster of Mr. Richie's 1992 \\"Back To Front\\". It includes two songs not on the original CD, \\"Dancing On The Ceiling\\" and \\"Stuck On You\\". Yet this leads me to the negative.<br /><br />This disc despite adding two more selections and being so well produced has the shortened, and in my opinion less likeable, \\"radio edits\\" of such classics as \\"Still\\", \\"Sail On\\", \\"Three Times A Lady\\", etc. For example, \\"Sail On\\" on this disc is the 3:53 version rather than the 5:30 album version. I find this very disappointing for a disc where so much went into it's mastering and production, not to mention price. Since it's obviously not simply a \\"better sounding\\" version of the original, by virtue of it's inclusion of two more songs, why not give us \\"better\\" sound of the better long versions and really make it something special? For this reason I can't give this disc a higher rating. If it had the long versions it would've easily gotten 5 stars. If you want the long versions I recommend the 2006 \\"Lionel Richie/Commodores Gold\\" 2 disc CD set by Hip-O. It features every song on this disc plus a lot more. It also has very good sound quality remastering which I've found to be the case with all of the \\"Gold collections\\"Gold [Original recording remastered]<br />Commodores, Lionel Richie   Format: Audio CD<br />. It's selling for far less than this disc. $15.38 from Amazon and even less from other sellers. I give the the K2HD disc A+ for sound, D- for music content, overall a C. If you want exceptional sounding short versions then get this disc. If you want exceptional sounding long versions take a pass on this. If you want the album versions go for the well remastered \\"Gold\\" set.of the better long versions and really make it something special? For this reason I can't give this disc a higher rating. If it had the long versions it would've easily gotten 5 stars. If you want the long versions I recommend the 2006 \\"Lionel Richie/Commodores Gold\\" 2 disc CD set by Hip-O.

B005C9YZIW|5.0|Great price! Fast shipping! Got it in time for Xmas. My dad loved it. I would buy from them again!
B002RVZVO0|4.0|I give this dvd a 4  star not for the quality of the dvd and not the sound they were great. The Beatles sounded and look tired they were off key in some songs, but other then that this is not a bad copy consider that it was 1966. The extra on the dvd is in japanese so there fore all you can do is watch and enjoy. Don't get me wrong when it comes about the Beatles I been a fan since 1962. If you enjoy the Beatles and there were few concerts that was tape and recorded at that time after all it's the Fab Four and that is and always be history. I say get this one. The Drummer.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Finally, I found the DVD I was looking for.  This is Cher at her best. For the last 40 years there hasn't been any singer who's even come close to her talent and showmanship. The lady has style and class and you can't say that about any of today's singers!

0399242864|5.0|I first saw this book at the Tate Modern Museum on a trip to London. It is the story about a boy trying to catch a star with no luck until he finds one washed up on the beach in the form of a starfish. I live in Charleston, S.C. and grew up on the beach. This story reminded my of one my grandmother told me when I told her that wishing on a star was a waste of time. She said, \\"Oh, darlin' the falling star falls into the ocean, and the wish only comes true when you find that star once it washes up on the beach.\\" I loved that idea and in the late summer of 1998 we had a strange marine occurence here in Charleston causing hundreds of starfish to wash up on local beaches. No, ALL my dreams didn't come true but I called my grandmother to remind her of the story and she said she'd made it up on the spot because she didn't want me to lose hope in making wishes.....I love her for that....

B004I1WIWU|5.0|This chick can really sing. She has a very subtle yet powerful voice. Make no mistake about it, this is an incredible album. Now I have to get 19.
B004VQFQ2Q|5.0|in all honesty this is my all time favorite black sabbath album.i bought the lp when it was originally released in 1983.i was just getting into hard rock and heavy metal,and this was my introduction to what i consider to be sabbath's heaviest album of all time.contrary to what many critics have said,this is a album that demonstrates veteran heavy rockers at their absolute best.this deluxe edition is not much more improved in sound quality than the 1996 gimcastle remaster.i wasn't expecting there to be a noticeable difference in leaps and bounds.if anything,having the inclusion of the bonus disc 2 with unreleased studio and live tracks makes it worth purchasing.buy it from amazon for sure.i can't say enough about born again.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Racheal Erb  Dr. Shea  English 110  Paper 3  The Fall   The Fall is a (2008) visionary adventure film by director Tarsem Singh.  The film was shot in over 20 different countries, and the effort to capture the beautiful scenery of each of the individual countries is evident within the film.  The film covers the interaction between a severely injured stunt man, Roy Walker, and a young injured girl, Alexandria, who is also staying at the hospital.  The film follows the character's interactions both within the hospital and in a story that Roy is telling Alexandria.   As the film progresses, it becomes clear that the director intended Roy to be both the antagonists and protagonists of the story.  The lighting around Roy's face changes with his intentions with his interactions with Alexandria.  During one heartbreaking scene where Roy is trying to convince Alexandria to steal morphine from the hospital to use in a suicide attempt, the lighting in the entire room goes much darker, except for around Alexandria's eyes.  The light from Alexandria's eyes was used to demonstrate the innocence and general trust that she has for Roy's intentions.   The film also reflects on how our past knowledge is used in our imaginations.  While Roy is telling the fantasy to Alexandria, the costuming for his otherwise partially historical characters creates a futuristic feel to the film.  Darwin is the scientist of the group, and acts like an observer to the character's movements, but he wears a red, white, and black furred coat with a bowler hat and black boots.  Another character, Otta Benga, a fit former slave has what one would anticipate for traditional garments, but has a hat more recognizable in Hellboy then in a historical image.  Certain props within the film also show the mixture of futuristic and historical, such as the space-aged car in front of the Taj Mahal.   The setting of The Fall creates an adventure within itself.  The heroes of Roy's fantasy must battle their way through adesert to an insane maze, and back to the riches of royalty.  As the characters face each new physical area, it becomes quite clear that certain characters are not as readily able to adapt to the new setting as others.  Roy's fantasy character responds the same regardless of location, but as Darwin moves to the palace it is clear that he is outside his realm of comfort.   An incredible feat of the movie is that it was done entirely without any computer, CGI, support.  While watching the film move across the fast land of the desert to the close shots that stare directly into the character's eyes, I realized just difficult the movie was to create without computer support.  To think that all the shots in the film had to be created physically, and then captured at the precise moments to visual the true artistic mastery it's a phenomenal success.   Due to the amount of time the director committed to the film, there is a certain expectation that the viewer will also dedicate time to the film.  Therefore, the story moves rather slowly.  Everything from the camera's flow over the individual characters, to the speed that Roy speaks is done in a slow fluid movement that captures the beauty of the scene.  This does detract somewhat from the core story of Roy's journey from dark to light.  Yet, certain scenes would not have an impact for Roy's character if they were rushed through; in those cases this technique was vital for creating a masterful film.   One moment, in the movie, that is very memorable is during one of Roy's earlier fantasy stories.  The fantasy army is found trapped within a desert after just escaping the opposing army with no supplies and no map to show them the way home.  A messenger sent out to look for water, who carries a single helmet of water, reaches the commander.  The commander takes the helmet and slowly pours all the remaining water onto the burning sand, giving hope for any of his men to survive.  The negative outcome of those men reflects Roy's loss of hope for his own personal survival and lack of will to live.   Roy's story reflects the film's almost desperate  plea for hope.  As the characters make their way through each fantastical image, there is an undertone of man trying to find a reason to live.  With each prop, whether it's a futuristic car or a burning tree, Roy is trying to distract himself from his reality.  He is looking for not only a reason to save the characters in his story, but also himself.   Alexandria's blind belief that the heroes of Roy's story reflect the little hope Roy has in within him for a better life.  Alexandria's challenging childhood, but perseverance for hope in Roy and herself, demonstrate to Roy the hope he could have if he chooses.  At the end of the story, when it is only Roy's character and Alexandria left alive, Alexandria cries out in desperation \\"why is everyone dying?\\".  Roy realizes that Alexandria is asking why does he have to die?  He finally succumbs to the girl's wishes that he lives, because he realizes that Alexandria loves him.  He has to be bigger than his own personal demons, to spare Alexandria from developing her own, through his death.   The Fall is a quirky film that shows the darkness found within all people, but also the light and courage to survive that lives within the very young.  The subtle changes of lighting give great support to the emotions of the characters.  The actions of Roy's fantasy characters and their personal appearance reflect Roy's incapacity to see the light himself.  The images are used to not only tell the tale of Roy's fantasy, but also provide insight into the thoughts of Roy as a character himself.

0525478817|5.0|The Fault in Our Stars   John Green's The Fault in Our Stars follows the story of sixteen year-old cancer patient on her quest to have a normal life.  The story deals with not only her own personal tragedy of having cancer, but also the complications of her cancer to those she closest to.   Hazel Grace Lancaster has been dealing with cancer for years in her young life.  The cancer has metastasized to her lungs; therefore, an absolute cure is not an option for Hazel.  Yet, Hazel longs for a normal teenager's life, filled love, hope, and freedom.  She finds her first love in Augustus Waters, who is later revealed to have a severe complication of his osteo sarcoma that has spread to essentially all his major organs.  Augustus' tragic death is a major trial for Hazel to get over.  Yet, Augustus' life only meant something because Hazel loved him from his point of view.   While Hazel may come off as pessimistic in the book about her cancer, she is absolutely hopeful about the futures of those she loves.  She desires her parents to be able to live normal lives after her passing.  Even though her desire for her mother to have a normal life comes across as ungrateful for her help, it's truly so that Hazel does not have to feel like a burden.  She can visual her parents futures without her as though where they still succeed in life, instead of falling into the pit of despair that is her disease.  John Green tells Hazel's story with frank honesty.  Hazel is not a saint just because she has cancer.  She has moments of being a terrible child like all teenagers.  However, the true magic of John Green's story is the passion Hazel has for life.  She wants to live, even if it is a modified version due to her physical limitations, despite knowing death so well.  Her passion extends to not only her life, but the life of those around her.  At one point in the book, Hazel becomes irate with her mother; because she feels that her mother is becoming entirely the care taker of a disease.Hazel finds great comfort that her mother has started taking courses for master's degree, instead of solely focusing on her disease.   Hazel desires freedom.  Her desire for freedom not only from her physical limitations that arise from her cancer, but also the emotional complications that arise due to her disease.  At one point, Hazel is given the opportunity to go to Amersterdam to visit her favorite author with Augustus.  However, some of Hazel's doctors feel that the risk of flying a patient who is on oxygen and is the first successful patient on an experimental drug is too great.  Hazel's physical limitations threaten to stop her from getting the closure she needs to move on from her obsession of her favorite book.   John Green's true strength in the books arise the in the blatant honesty that the disease is given to each of the characters.  Some of the characters live, and go onto live normal happy lives.  Yet, would the success stories of some the characters mean anything mean anything without the loss of other characters?  The loss of Augustus reiterates the desire of life for Hazel.  At times, it may seem that the book has lost hope, but it always comes back as in life.  I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever known the real beauty of life arises from the pain that we feel in tragedy and our trials are what shape as individuals.  I would also like warn future viewers that the books mentioned within The Fault in Our Stars are not real books, which is the only real disappointment of the book.

B001UHOWXI|5.0|Found out they only play this on tv twice during the holidays. Now my family and I have it for ourselves and can watch it whenever we want.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|Whether it's a major block buster film, a comical television show, or a re-imagining of a classic series of stories it seems that we Americans can't match our British counterparts when it comes to original entertainment.  This film, while entertaining, doesn't capture the feel or intrigue of a \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" story; perhaps if it were released 15 years ago, before all the \\"twists\\" and \\"shocking reveals\\" were commonplace on basic cable.  I believe this film, and its sequel, could have done just as well (maybe better) if they weren't trying to jump on the Holmes \\"mythos.\\"  If you're a fan of the intrigue and mystery that's the basis of a good Sherlock story, of the \\"I didn't see that coming\\" and the \\"How did they pull that off?\\" then I STRONGLY RECOMMEND you avoid this film and instead turn your attention to the \\"Sherlock\\" series produced by the BBC; you know, the company that's based in the traditional home of Sherlock Holmes.

B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I looked at many different covers for my fire with my main focus being basic screen protection and something that doubled as a stand.  This cover was what I finally decided to buy.  Pros-  Decent Cover  Good fit  built in stand  Not hideous looking  Cons-  cheap build  non-cheap price  elastic handle is so flimsy it's not really usable  stand unfolds really easy.  Basically, I'd feel pretty good about the purchase if the price was around $10-15. As is, I have that feeling in the pit of my stomach like I bought some hdmi cables at Best Buy.  I'd probably return if I found something better for a reasonable price.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|My case is absolutely awesome. Ive used my kindle fire umpteen times a day since receiving it in November and the elastic strap still hasn't given out! Lol The only thing I would improve would be to have the stand hold the kindle up vertically as well as horizontally.  Otherwise, it is absolutely great.
