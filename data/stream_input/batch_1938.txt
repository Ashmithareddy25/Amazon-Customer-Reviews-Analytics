B005NK69ZC|4.0|really enjoyed this book, it was like listening to Ellen on her talk show.  Lots of laughs and giggles throughout
B002ECN4P0|4.0|Nice, Need Greatest Hit Part 2, Most of the Songs I was Looking for wasnt there, But I'll buy Greatest Hit 2
B009JBZH54|5.0|I've always loved all the Batman movies. I bought this as one of many Christmas gifts for my boyfriend and we both enjoy watching it together during movie nights. It's a very nice and simple gift set. Everybody loves batman! :)
1423140605|4.0|Riordan continues the saga!<br />My grandson and I share the love of Mythology and<br />Rick Riordan has done so much for Mythology with<br />his series! He has introduced the younger generations<br />to it!!  And we can't get enough!!
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|I went constantly back and forth. I liked katniss then I didn't. Then I liked her character again and then it was like I was numb and just wanted to finish the book. Objectively a well written series. But I doubt t I could ever bring myself to read it again.
B0051GY0LS|2.0|I thought the story line was a little weak and a very short read. Not his usual fantastic standard. disappointing
B005EGXNLS|3.0|I have read many books by Cornwell and find most of them 4 and 5 star reads.  HIs trilogy on King Arthur is creative and profound.  I have thrilled at parts of the Saxon Chonicles and the exploits of Utred, but Death of Kings was brief and contributed little to the series.  I down loaded the book for free so have little to complain about, but would have felt ripped off if I paid 10 bucks or more for the book.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Despite knowing how the story ends, it kept me interested till the last page. Great book about great men and the sacrifice they make every day. Not just on one day.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Greek and Roman mythology lovers would enjoy reading about Percy and Jason learning on how to work as a team instead of handling every minor quests by themselves. This book shows how some members copes with the fears they grew up with and how they overcome their phobias. The reader can easily visualize every task and scenes that the young demigods faces throughout the book. Can't wait until the next book comes out.
B00A992W9Y|5.0|For only $6, this is great buy. Almost every song is amazing, with the exception of a few. Definately worth it
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Classic tale is a beautiful piece of literature...Dickens is a great author...this was a thoroughly enjoyable,albeit short, read..highly recommended short story
B00992CF6W|4.0|does this really worth 7.00$  h h Lvi j u u u u u I j j I uvk uvivu u I
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I did really like this book, especially the tender affection between the characters.  And even though I was disgusted, it was actually interesting to see things from the bad guys point-of-view as well.  I just wish there had been more development between them before it was all &#34;I love you&#34;.  But then, that's the way most of his books are so I guess it should not come as a surprise.  I do think this will make a great romantic movie and I can't wait to see it!
B006ATJXQW|2.0|This book was ok.  I thought it would be about Thomas and Teresa and how they came to the decision to enter the maze. I had so many questions about what their involvement was before having their memory wiped.  This book was a disappointment. Prequels generally have some of the same characters as are in subsequent books. Maybe if I had read this first, I would have enjoyed it more.
0756407125|5.0|Only problem is there is no book 3.  Can't wait until it comes out. I'll be buying it right away!
B009MF56GC|5.0|Bought as a Christmas present for my husband's step-dad.  We enjoyed the first one and have enjoyed this one also.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|An engaging story.  Sometimes the technical aspects slowed down the pace,  but the suspense  building and KEPT you turning pages .  LOVED the humor.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This game is just magical and thrilling I could not wait to get to the end of it I might actually play it again
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Very cute and entertaining. The short puzzles allow you to pick it up and play it at any time, whether it's for a few minutes or a few hours.
B00785P2QC|5.0|fun fantastic enjoying it loving highly recommended game for ure kindle and enjoyin enjoying these little games and really looking forward to any other games u bring out five stars defo
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This movie is not for kids. There is a lot of swearing. BUT, for the adults, I laughed my @$$ off throughout the movie. Just hilarious! By renting it in HD & at it's highest resolution 1080, it took quite a while to download this. Even with my Kindle sitting right in front of the modem. So don't go trying to watch it right after renting it because you will only be able to watch a little bit, then it will freeze until it downloads a little more, then you'll watch a little more, then it freezes all over again. Bottom line, if you want to rent a movie, do so, download it overnight while you sleep. Then just watch it the next day. Because once you START watching it, even if it isn't downloaded yet, your rental time frame starts then.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|These books are not too bad. But man can they keep their hands off of each other for at least one chapter.
B00ARPMIJE|3.0|I really liked this story. It's very much like a modern Cinderella. However despite this book's gripping nature the writing contained many grammatical and punctuation errors. Also, the words used to describe feelings and the flow of the bookmarks the writing feel as if it were that of a sixth grader. I was disappointed that the writings not match the standard of the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book because it's got more meaning in the love between Peeta Melark and Katniss Everdeen and Peeta telling the world that she's pregnant with him and that they are married already.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book is an amazing completion to the first book. Ken Fillet is able to make his characters come to life
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Definitely worth watching. I bought it after renting it. De Niro is great as a pirate with a secret (but I will not spoil it for you), so is Michelle Pfeiffer as a witch.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Definitely one of those gluttonous reads if you need a break from the more serious books. It was well worth it.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Great movie (one of my all time favorites), Blu-Ray is a bit soft but still OK considering the movie is a bit dated.
B005HSL626|1.0|I was really happy until an ad popped up for a HORROR FILM. Thank goodness I was the one that it popped up for... this app was supposed to be appropriate for children?
B0032KNA4I|4.0|Plot is sometimes cringe-inducing but special effects are great. Blu-Ray is worth the purchase at reasonable price. Need 3 more words
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I loved this game. Kept me guessing. Great graphics and storyline. I wish the game was a bit longer though. Still loved it.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|If you are a fan of old school ZZ, you will like this. It is a guitar oriented album, so if you are a fan of the keyboard fuzzy guitar pop Top, be warned. This is ZZ Top returning to form. The lil old band from Texas is KICKING ASS again!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this app more then temple run! But in order for me to update the app I have to uninstall and reinstall the app! Also if my kindle fire is even close to dying it deletes everything! pls fix this!!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book, could not stop the read.  From start to finish an exciting and powerful book.  The continuation of the storyline was exceptional.
B008VBYN80|5.0|Lots of fun. Plenty to do to eat up time. A real free game. Can easily be played without donating real money.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|Was surprised at how much I liked the rest of the CD, beyond their hit &#34;Use Somebody.&#34;  Hope these guys have the success they deserve.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This item was shipped fast and was of great quality enjoyed watching this again and again with my daughter we love Disney movies
B005DESVPO|4.0|It was all about the first track for me.  The other tracks were OK but now I only listen to track #1.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Perfect in every way.<br />A great novel with a great ending. Beautiful story I love a happy ending an  this set was it
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Fantastic edition of the famous adventures of our hero, Indiana Jones.  The Blu-ray version is a must for those who loved the original adventures as it increases the enjoyment with its visually enhanced detail!  For me, the only one of the adventures which I am not crazy about is \\"The Temple of Doom\\", so this set allowed me to own everything as a set without feeling \\"compelled\\" to spend a ridiculous amount of extra money on such an unworthy component!  Over the years my feelings about this installment have never changed, but it is good to have it I suppose for purposes of discussion and comparison.  The other movies however make it all worthwhile and then some!
B0041KKYDI|3.0|It's pretty much an average DVD, but it looks used. It's not bad, but don't give it as a gift!
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I've got this app on my PC and iPhone, and it's a great way to keep all my passwords updated and available on ALL my devices.<br />Just remember to not set it to 'remember' the master password on mobile devices--that way, if the device is lost, no one can get access to your passwords.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great Quality, Like a Store Shelf! It's basically like driving over to Best Buy or something and getting the DVD, same thing, but cheeper here!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As usual the visual effects are exceptional and story line delivers and leaves you hungering for more. With the reappearance of old characters and bringing in new characters, the show gives us those we love and those we love to hate. Can't wait for the season to resume.
B009JBZH54|5.0|the price was un beatable and i knew what to expect as far as the blue rays go, but the box was of good quality and somewhat of a velvet finish the book inside had some great pictures, the shipping was quick and no issues what so ever.
B000002AGN|4.0|I heard &#34;Time Out&#34;  when I was very young during HS years. Dave's music appeals to every generation. Excellent jazz music which I recommend for anyone
0880796863|5.0|Came with a great book and the cards have very nice art. It's a really nice set and at a good price. I was happy with this.
B007KAJG3K|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. is fun to watch in this. I just got it because he is a consummate actor..Gotta love it.
B0046RE5HW|5.0|Always delivers- with a great twist at the end of this one. More so than usual. Complex but easy reading
B001NS5F62|4.0|Dire Straits saved their best for last.  The songs are well balanced and the Mr. Knoffler's guitar work is at it's most thoughtful and sublime.
B0053TMP24|1.0|Awesomeness. Rick riodan  has done it again. Insanely funny. I love it. I  love all of his books. One awesome book.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|OK for quick fixes. I used it to change the photo size and it worked well. However, not comparable to Microsoft Picture it! which is also a basic photo editor.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Reasonably well written but VERY disappointing ending. I felt the book was leading up to something and then it didn't deliver. Did not live up to it's hype.
1451613512|4.0|- but still a good (if superficial) read.  Stone is an iconoclast, more interested in smashing official preconceptions than structurally creating alternatives.  Though the history discussed here is a twice-told tale, it's still locked in the closet of official mythology and will strike readers of standard material as fresh or outrageous.  To even hint at many of the events reviewed - authentically true history that they are - would get most public school teachers fired.  (Hence one reason for slashing tenure: how school boards and their sponsors prevent the deconstruction of politically convenient mythology.)  Any parents serious about their child's education should see this work (and Zinn) are read at home, besides the sanctioned textbooks.  Fortunately, the private book industry has not yet sunk to the standards of American education: a loophole the corporate merger network may resolve as have local school systems, with future editions appearing as hand-typed samizdat.
B009WJ14FA|5.0|My wife and I like the energy of the sessions and the vocals are great.  Also, the price was right.
B008AITJ24|4.0|The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the season was shorter than usual. Season seven had only 13 episodes, besides that I love the show.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I am and probably always will be a sucker for books about books.  The magic they contain within their pages, the look, feel and smell of books...describe that experience to me while I am in the throes of a good book and I am in heaven.<br /><br />\\"Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore\\" provided a wonderful book adventure - narrated by an aficionado of books.  Or the written word.  Or a certain bookstore.  Anyway, someone who speaks my language.<br /><br />\\"They are a ward against claustrophobia; without them, it would feel like a catacomb down here, but because they line the shelves and lend the chamber color and texture, it actually felt cosseted and comfortable.\\"  The main character, Clay, even appreciates the look and atmosphere that books create when not being read.<br /><br />And this is certainly ad adventure - one fully embraced and acknowledged by Clay.  As he tries to look behind the curtain of a mysterious new world he has encountered, and as he tried to delve into the secrets of his employer, Mr. Penumbra, he assembles the requisite players for an adventure.  A rogue, a warrior, a wizard...and of course, a quest.<br /><br /> \\"Neel takes a sharp breath and I know exactly what it means. It means I have waited my whole life to walk through a secret passage built into a bookshelf.\\"<br /><br />The author, Robin Sloan, does a good job melding the world of printed books, duty, immortal works of art and the new electronically available books.  Clay is young, so his world is more pixels than pages...but he has an appreciation for the craft of those who have written and published ink on paper.  This straddling of the past/present/and future - along with the pros and cons of both - is handled very well.  Since I am in the place in my reading life where I am contemplating how to incorporate e-books into my library and reading habits - this was actually one of the strongest aspects of the story for me.<br /><br />And in the end, it comes down to the story.  To adventures both real and imaginary.  To the lives we live on Earth and the lives we live vicariously through the books we read.<br /><br />\\"There is no immortality that is not built on friendship and work done with care.<br />...in the world worth knowing are hiding in plain sight. It takes forty-one seconds to climb a ladder three stories tall. It's not easy to imagine the year 3012, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't try. We have new capabilities now - strange powers we're still getting used to.  The mountains are a message from Aldrag the Wyrm-Father.  Your life must be an open city, with all sorts of ways to wander in.\\"oth real and imaginary.

0143121006|4.0|A debutante, her scholar (adoptive) father, Peking just as WW2 is beginning, the Japanese Army, White Russians (including prostitutes, madams and a pimp hermaphrodite), heroin and opium sellers and addicts, and enough low lives to fill up \\"Rick's American Bar\\" to make any film noir afficianado with envy.  That and a the mutilated murdered body of the blond debutante and you have a story better than most made up mysteries.  Read it.<br /><br />Zeb Kantrowitz
B009IF8CH6|5.0|The story line seems to get better all the time.  Kudos to the actors who have developed their characters perfectly.  I'm looking forward to each new episode!
0399160450|4.0|Another &#34;chapter&#34; in the extended biography of the Ryan Dynasty, &#34;Threat Vector&#34; reaches pretty far into the unlikely possibilities for it's plot line.  I felt I was reading some of Clancy's earlier novels using alternative sub-plots to bring out a new volume. Maybe it is time for the daughter to get involved with some counter-culture activities that would force Jack Junior to have to make a choice about eliminating his own sister, or leaving His booming spy-career for something less conventional.<br /><br />I think Clancy has come close to the end of this production line....Maybe publishing a short summation in which all the surviving characters, from ALL the novels settled in at the Ryan Presidential Library for an &#34;After-Action&#34; Seminar.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY!  HE IS THE GREATEST!  READ 2 BOOKS OF THE TRILOGY, CAN'T WAIT FORTHE THIRD TO COME OUT IN 2014!
0374214913|4.0|Just when you thought the days of wizards, warriors and evil overlords were a thing of medieval fantasy comes along a book that brings them back to life again ...but with a modern twist. Spell casting comes in the form of computer programs with wizards working in Google and Hadoob, and warriors are bookstore clerks and start up CEOs.<br /><br />There's a secret club called the Unbound Spine with the goal of members being to solve the puzzle around the Founder's codex vitae which is believed to contain the essence of immortality. The club is currently controlled by a man who believes the quest must only be conducted through years of study and code breaking without the use of modern technology. So no computers are to be used, even if it means they may be able to get to the secret today rather than perhaps in 50 years.<br /><br />But along comes our warrior, Clay Jannon, a nighttime book clerk at Mr Penumbra's bookstore, who stumbles upon the secret in logs stored at the bookstore, and the members who come in to borrow certain books in sequence. When Mr Penumbra closes his bookstore and disappears as a result of an unprecedented act by Clay, Clay rounds up his band of warriors to search for him and save him from the 'burning'.<br /><br />It starts off a little slow, but gathers a momentum before long. Woven into the story is also a look at how Google operates as a company and explanations into what big data applications like Hadoop allow us to achieve and how. It's an interesting blend of diminishing the cloud that sometimes covers today's technology and keeping with the more traditional quest that fantasy readers are familiar with.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK AND THE OTHER  OF THE TRILOGY!  CANNOT WAIT UNTIL THE THIRD COMESOUT IN 2014!  I HAVE READ HIS OTHER BOOKS, AND HE IS THE BEST.
B0091REZMW|3.0|enjoyed but not loved.  seems fun but already requiring I purchase things to get further.  what do ya expect in a free game though.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Read the book since it was the final in the series. Was a good book and I thought the ending was fitting for the series.
B00979CS50|5.0|I have not heard it yet but I'm sure it is great, every thing Neil does is fabulous.  Thank You
0439023521|5.0|I ordered this my accident but I am glad I did I have read it 3 times now. Good read!
B00785P2QC|3.0|I played virtual city first and thought this was like an expansion or sequel, but this one isis geared towards lots of in-app purchases.  Kind of annoying and slower game pace if you don't want to pay for quicker/more stuff.<br /><br />Updated:  I've had this for a while now.  Once you have a pretty big city, the game is extremely slow to load as it recalculates the earnings from the various buildings.  Takes almost 4 -5 minutes to load at this point, and I've barely even occupied a quarter of the available map space.  I'll probably stop playing soon.  Changed rating to a three.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game makes you think several makes ahead. If you like sudoku you will enjoy playing free flow. The colors are great.
B007F7XXKA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I think the author made pertinent points, and gave the reader much to think about. I noted some of the reviewers pointing out small errors, or examples of bias. In spite of this, I found the book to be interesting and informative
B0007GAEGC|4.0|came on time and was in good shape in the packaged materials, the book is a good read for young adults
B0070YDOT8|4.0|this is not what i expected it to i found some better ones that i really like it a nice item but i just did not want it at this time
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The graphics were terrific. really enjoyed the storyline.  it wasn't so hard that I got frustrated. it is definitely worth the 2.99 I paid for it.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I was so pleased to see this book on the shelf of Nicholas Hoare in Toronto. I couldn't buy it then but when I returned home it was my Christmas present to me.<br />As were all the stories before it was great. I hope that Rebus will continue.
B000003BES|5.0|Big Hits (High Tide and Green Grass) is one of the better Hits albums by the RS. Fan of them when they first started.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Great product for listing to local radio and sports station. Also has ease of use, and very little buffer issues.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|She loves it.  Came quickly and safely packaged. I don't know what else to say but apparently I am supposed to say more.

B0068TJLSY|4.0|This is a good movie to watch for fun or just some light entertainment.  It isn't Oscar winning material, but then every film doesn't have to be, so that's okay.  It is just good entertainment.  The kids who were the stars in the movie were amazing actors - totally convincing.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|A really good read, but gives a lot of personal experiences not war related initially. You WILL want the book to end differently by the time you get to the final chapters - very sad.
1577312082|1.0|Okay so it did make me realize that all we have is the NOW and not to worry too much about the future but how many times do you have to hear him say that in a 1,000 different ways?
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Im a fan of every action actor in this movie.  Ive been waiting for the sequel since the first Expendables.  And Im equally excited about the third installment of the franchise
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The book was extremely entertaining.  The editing seemed a tad inconsistent (a lot of &#34;he said&#34;) throughout and the plot was generally predictable with very obvious setups.<br /><br />But like I said it was very entertaining.  If you like 80s pop culture, video games and dystopian future themes you will enjoy this book.

1455519006|3.0|Most suspense novels, Baldacci's or any othe authors, don't have the tender, caring aspect demonstrated by Will Robie in this story.  Thank you, David Baldacci, for this good tale.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I grew up on Pacman, so to get this on my Kindle (for FREE!) has been great.  The controls respond fairly well and the graphics are good.  For a free game, it exceeded my expectations.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Sorry the story didn't ring true.  I am a Board Certified Medical Psycho-therapist retired from private practice and a major university medical center.  Over many years, I worked with many, many critically ill and dying patients and their families.  The brain of a critically ill and/or dying patient is starved for oxygen and/or chemically unbalanced.  Visual, auditory, and olfactory hallucinations are not uncommon and vary from patient to patient depending on life experience.  Those patients who do survive their medical crisis often remember some of their hallucinations and report that they are aware that the hallucinations were not real even though they can vividly discribe what they saw, heard,or smelled.  The human brain is a fantastic organ.

B00006CXSS|5.0|as advertised. no problems. great shipping cost and time considering I live on guam a u.s. territory in the middle of the pacific. good use of usps, since again guam is a u.s. territory.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|didn't expect much for a free app.  but I love it!  has a great clock as well. It also has more downloads available.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is one of the best stories of &#34;conversion&#34; ever written. It is very perceptive of Charles Dickens to understand the workings of the human psyche.  He cleverly uses images from the past, present and future to evoke deep emotion in Scrooge to break his icy heart and bring him back into the human community.<br />I also enjoyed the style of writing. It brought the period of time into sharp focus and drew the reader right into the story.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|These books had me on the edge of my seat all the way through!<br /><br />The setting is fantastic and original. The story is interesting and original. The characters are very much alive and they feel like real people. Everything about this series is a product of either very hard work or a very able mind...probably both I guess.<br /><br />Hugh Howey is also not afraid of killing his characters and you will have to say goodbye a couple of times where you will be surprised. I really like that because life is not predictable in the way that a lot of stories are. It feels more realistic when everything can happen and this story is like that.<br /><br />I won't even comment on the Sci-Fi part of this, because you would want to take the trip into this world on your own like I did: With no expectations of any kind. Just know that it is very much worth it to buy this book. Best value for money I have had on my Kindle ever!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Interesting enough to keep you reading.  Subject matter could be a bit disturbing for some.  Good character development and decent suspense.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Read Gone Girl and loved it - and I seldom read crime or mystery. Just casually started this book and was wrapped up in it in about two minutes and read the entire book. What an incredible brilliance this lady has!
B00ADYY7MA|5.0|If you Love the show.. You .must have the soundtrack....I love  it.......you will too....download he sound track today and enjoy it
B00A80SHFM|4.0|I gave this only 4 stars cause this Cd does not include 'Do you hear the people sing?' Or 'Little Drops of rain'. I dont understand how their not considered a highlight. Other than that, this is a great CD for every Les Miz fan. I'm a big fan of Eddie Redmayne and I admit to buying this CD mainly so I can hear him singing, though I'm disappointed that 'Little Drops of rain' isnt included in this. But it has 'Empty chairs at empty tables', which is my fave song that he sings, so I'm pretty happy. And since I've seen the movie twice now I can envision the acting during the songs. I only hope that a complete recording comes out soon with ALL of the songs on it.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|Great to watch something that provides a little comic relief without being juvenile...great cast...Love the interaction with Castle and his daughter and mother.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I laughed and I cried. It's nothing you can predict.....Holder had the perfect words to say to Sky. From beginning to end its worth the read.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I downloaded this for my 5 yo daughter and I got sucked into it. Now we play together and I find my self playing on my own. It can be expensive if you buy the extras but I PW protected all purchases and we just play with what we can get for free. You can friend me: Gameloft ID: cdbear_83
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Nelson DeMille is one of my favorite authors. But The Panther is not. I read half of the book bc I was hoping that it would get better but it just dragged. DeMille 's humor and insight are great but not good enough this time to to keep my interest. I'm sure there's good action and plot somewhere and I may pick it up again to finid out what happens in San'a.
B007NR9WBG|4.0|On this one I hade heard some things about the aspect  of the wide screen not being quite right, But other reviews I read hade said this version got it right. So I thought I'd give it a try,  One thing I noticed was that the  Aspect had changed in several parts of the Film,  The most interesting parts of it was pretty wide ,  Other parts were almost like 4.3 aspector full screen.  I never  hade the DVD copy this ,  So I can't tell how much it mite be, But I seemed pretty dame good to me. Over all an excellent Blue ray
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft pocket edition is the best game I ever played on earth it is so cool. when I always play it
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first two books have to be the best books ever.However,this book was disappointing and very boring.I don't think that they should have made this book.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|The book was well-written, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was slow to develop and, to be honest, very little happened throughout the book.  We see some scenes of Jaime's childhood in a Catholic orphanage, which was horrific, but apart from that the entire plot centers around him and a woman who are looking for marriage partners.  In my opinion, that doesn't make for a very interesting read.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the fact that I can win if I work it out.  It is a fun challenge for me.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I have bought and downloaded several other Mahjong games, but this one is hands down the best I've ever seen... I'm hooked!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am always watching the weather and now I have it on my new Kindle fire 8.5 so where ever I go will have the weather available
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Hot and steamy and well written.  The story flows right into book two and three.  I sure hope there are more books written by this author.
B007SGM084|3.0|The first book had too much &#34;chaining, etc.&#34;  I liked the second and third books much better as the story unfolded and I began to understand  &#34;&#34; WHY&#34;&#34;  he was that way.  It is degrading to women;  I skipped a  lot  of what went on in the red room;  could only take so much!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was better than the first.  I could not put this down.  There is more drama and intrigue than the first.  Ready to read the last book.  Ready for more!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|Wow, what a title. I liked the songs that were chosen for this CD and were well done. I like Taylor Swift and the songs that inspire her and I'm sure others as well. It is very good and if you like her this is really great.
B00866JL96|5.0|Love this movie. I tried to get this movie on Black Friday, they were all out selling at $4 that day. I went to three different stores to didn't find it. I'd seen that Amazon had it for the same price that day and ordered it while in line to check out at the store. I got it just a few days later in the mail. Great shipping time.
0756407125|5.0|I love the writing in this series! It has rich characters, a complex plot, and a feel of fantasy and history all at once. I highly recommend this writer!
B000I62JAK|5.0|One of my most favorite movies ever!!! Hilarious, cant believe it is from 2001-- before its time!! If you like Ben Stiller and Wil Ferrell you'll love this film.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The program is great but not perfect. I've noticed that sometimes when it crashes in windows XP it doesn't recover. When it fails to recover it also deletes the security password.  Update: After years of using this and a few updates, it's gotten much more stable. I haven't had the same issues in a long time. Once in a while, with a limited mobile connection, it can try to connect and fail but the computer thinks it has succeeded. That has locked me out of the computer for an hour or two  but it's better than it was. I haven't had to power down the computer to recover in a long time.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book really gets you thinking, a little tough at times sticking with the flow but it kept you going because you wanted to get Dr. Alexander's experience with a NDE.. Not sure if I like the way it just &#34;ended&#34;, but I found it very informative.  If you ever &#34;wonder&#34; about what happens after life, Dr. Alexander paints a clearer picture than most other similar books.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This was a perfect gift for my 14 year pld grandson. It was a little bit of current history that he could relate to. It makes a good desktop display.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I like this game it's fun and scary and its cool. my sister likes it to so for thumbs up
B0042HOTRC|4.0|We gave this Lego set to our 8 year old grandson. He enjoyed putting it together. He continues to play with it. When pieces fall off or there is an accident he keeps putting it back together.It also has an educational value as being part of our space program.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put this down. There was so much good story since all of the character development had been done in the first one. I don't read much, but got through this book in a couple days. Can't wait to read Mockingjay!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I got this for my wife and she loves it. Now we can't wait for more. Can't I give 6 stars????
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|I like the part where Leo builds the huge ship.  The part I dislike is that there is a lot of dialogue and not enough action.  I recommend it to anyone who has read Percy Jackson.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game really keeps your mind alert .  I now have my husband playing.  I recommend it for everyone.  hope you try playing very soon.  firefly
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The Fault in Our Stars examines life and death in a way that I have never known. It is beautifully written and truly calls to mind the indiscrepencies of human life and the universe that we live in. I would highly recommend this book to all adults and adolescents.
B000SEI230|5.0|Soo god!! I loved everything about this book. I cried like a baby at the end because it makes me think about how I sometimes take life for granite...
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|so much fun..Is very Addicting..Froze up a few times..But it working well right now. I would recommend it.<br />Only negative comment is that it has advertisements at the bottom of the screen when you 1st open it.
B009I2UH2W|2.0|Well.. lasted about a year before it broke. Better off getting a USB lighter charger and using an OEM Apple USB charger.  These aftermarket charges with cords never work right.
B007N6EUHI|5.0|This this is so cool.<br />NO IM not a doctor.<br />No Im not a med student.<br />But I do have a degree in computer animation, so I know what it takes to make this stuuf.<br />Im a disabled vet with nerve and muscle tissue damage to the spine in the whole cervical spine and two spot in the thoratic spine and a small area in the lumbar spine.<br />I have had these issuse for over twenty years now. I have read books and looked at pictures and even tried to modle the stuff out in my own modling software. But not of this got me closer to having a better insight to be able to see what was going on in my body.<br />This did,<br /><br />Ok ya its cost a butt load, but this this is too cool.<br />It covers everything that I can tell so far.<br />And it is very interactive.<br /><br />I recommend this for all ages
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|As someone who is coming back to Web development after three years, I found this book very insightful.  It would also be of value to any one who wants to know what HTML5 is all about.  The book does not demonstrate it with examples so if that's what you are looking for you will be disappointed.  Instead the book focus on why should you adopt HTML5 that goes beyond outlining the features.  Most other authors stop right there as if features alone were the most important factor.  This book will objectively describe the features significance.
B007WEQ3K8|3.0|not a bad game it has its issuse<br />glitches here and there<br />dosent always save data<br />dosent always show update in score while playing<br />still its would be cool if they got it fixed
B009VB7P6G|5.0|My kids and I thought this was the best one of the Tinker Bell movies!  Very entertaining.  You will love it!

B00AMBK0X4|4.0|Funny movie. A little over the top. To much f word. The fx on this was very good. Forgot Ted wasn't real after a while
B000F8O35U|5.0|I gave my original to a little girl who never saw this classic.  Finally replaced it in my library.  One of my favorites.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this presentation.  My wife especially enjoyed it and talked to all of her friends about it. Looking forward to the new season.
B006P4FBUE|3.0|Enjoyable but even though I took piano,prefer the real keyboard.  Just do not have room for one where I live.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I'm amazed by the challenge of this puzzle.  I received it as a Christmas present and imagine I'll have it solved sometime around next Christmas.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|One of my favorite bands,great Vidio  and the music rocks.  They only get better with age,like a fine wine.  Hope one day to see a live reunion in person.
B0043UB0EI|1.0|The acting was somewhere between awful and terrible. It was over dramatised and silly with a story line that silly. It fake blood flew all over the place and made for a boring spectacle of ridiculousness. Some people may see this as just a bit of fun. To be fun it needs some substance and this lacked any. It was trying to be 300 and didn't even come close 300 had a story line and the flying blood contributed to the story. It was fun because it had substance and was well written. Don't bother with this nonsense!
B005HSL626|4.0|This was different and more fun actually than at first thought it would be, nothing like slicing fruits, watch out for the bombs though
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a good book but it is kinda sad but still it is a very very good book I love it
B00A757EFW|4.0|This is a nice retro pac-man, just like in the olden atari games but Kindles are much nicer and portable.
B000I8G5NA|1.0|what the hell Amazon.  No closed captioning for this movie when viewing through the xbox 360!!!  this is ridiculous for people that are hearing impaired.  the dvd has it, so should you!!!
B007RE0RR8|4.0|My daughter is into the monster high dolls the last few years and really likes them all. thank you very much
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This has a great story line and no vulgar language.  It's sometimes hard to find a movie you would be comfortable watching with your family, but this is a great family movie.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|This is a very good game I loved it. It is kind of confusing at first but you get used to it. I would recommend this game to all ages.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|Schleich has always made the best quality products.  The unicorn looks so good that it could be real.  The item also arrived quickly and in good condition.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|great movie good service by your company good great good great super fantastic awesome. . . . . . .
B0073LWEXK|5.0|for those with a kindle HD its the best game I have ever played same with the haunted mantion they are intertaning
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great game and looking for something similar now.  Any suggestions out there?<br />Reminds me of some of the early PS?? games like  Monkey Island , etc.  Really enjoy solving puzzles!!!
B001FVV2X2|5.0|We didn't start watching Fringe till the 3rd season so we were lost as to the beginning.  We downloaded onto our Kindle and were able to watch while travelling.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|If you're a Susan Boyle fan, you'll love it. If you're not yet a Susan Boyle fan, try it, you'll soon fall in love with Susan's music too. She's fantastic.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Very nice, fun, and challenging but easy enough for my eight year old to play. Well worth the download. You won't be disappointed.
B000W9399S|5.0|Pratchett is a delight.  He is witty, intelligent and creative.  His books are always a mood lifter, and this book is the beginning of a series that delights with every volume.  Well worth the price, and a welcome addition to any library.  I have read it and re-read it.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Exciting 80s or 90s style action flick with big stars, giant explosions, and lots of guns. And the plane is the best character.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Intense and keeps you gripped with every word. I could not stop reading it and when it was over I wanted more.
B008OOYALE|4.0|my only complaint is the price of items you need in order to advance in the game. 10,000 coins to purchase a dragon is too pricey for me. I still enjoy playing
0316123587|4.0|My 14 year old wanted this for Christmas.  She was satisfied but wished there was more writing in it.  85% pictures.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Hooked on these games! Can't put it down once I start. Worth the money and very entertaining. Just sorry there are not more!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Couldn't stop reading! Lisbeth is a great character whom I cannot wait to learn more about in the next book!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|case does what it said it would have done water test an worked great, like the slimness of case not big an bulky like some case well protected.  Received prompt service would buy from seller again.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Makes me even more anxious for the season to begin. Gives you just enough information to make you wonder what will happen, how they got in their situation and how they will get out.
0375851569|5.0|I read my 6 month old grandson to sleep for his nap yesterday with two of these books. They are favorites for my 16 month old granddaughter as well. Classic children's books at a great price. :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was the saddest book I've ever read - and I read a lot... I highly recommend it to anyone. Anyone. It was touching and I can truly say that The Fault in Our Stars was literally the best book I've ever read.<br /><br />The best part - and saddest was how real he made it. It wasn't some tragic story where everything fell apart. It was all good until tragedy struck. And that tragedy could happen to anyone. The book touched my heart in ways no book ever has. Thank you, John Green.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great great great great great great great great g r e a t cool cool cool cool cool cool great great great cool cool cool cool
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Once I start playing, it is hard for me to put down.  I'm hoping to get good at it so I can challange my grandson...
B00A757EFW|1.0|I like Pac man but the controls are horrible and it gets boring fast it's the same thing every level.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I absolutely love &#34;proper English&#34; being spoken. Maybe that's why I love Harry Potter movies, Maggie Smith is the reason I started watching this. I've been a fan of hers for years and the cast is perfect. I'd strongly recommend this collection you will not regret it.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Once again  this book leaves me hanging with its sour and sweet endings/solutions it deserves every star it's earned in my favor.
B00A80SHFM|3.0|Les Miserables Highlighted songs, not the actual soundtrack of the complete movie. Russell Crowe can't sing! and he sings a few on this cd. Hugh Jackman can sing and doesn't sing enough and Anne Hathaway also doesn't sing enough. But the singer in this movie is Amanda Seyfried and she only gets 1 song, one? Mamma Mia!. You might like this but honestly I regret purchasing it, I should have listened to it on Spotify first.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|EVERYTHING! This book has everything. It's so freaking hot and sexy and sad... I can't wait for the next book.
B008WCP2KG|3.0|When you have seen the previews you think &#34;okay, nude guys, hot dang&#34;. The guys are great, handsome and dance well, but the movie could have been better without Matthew, Channing was the reason I bought this Blu-ray. He's hot and worth purchasing just to see his body. Alex Pettyfer, Joe Manganiello, Matt Bomer are all hot and Matt being out and proud in real life made me also want this video. You'll enjoy the guys, I did and I'm gay it's worth the money.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Took an entirely different spin than one could expect.. yet i couldn't take my eyes away away. You feel alive in the world of panem and taking these adventures were fantastic.. i only wish they could continue. Thank you suzanne collins for such a wonderful story.
B004LWZW9M|5.0|From the Director of Pretty Woman among others, did it again. The cast is great and to see them intertwined in some way made this movie great. Lea Michele is the primary reason I bought this, the girl can sing and her acting is flawless. Ashton is the perfect match for her. How Ashton has never been on the cover of People as the Most Handsome Man in America is beyond me, he's gorgeous. Good movie, see it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing, I can't wait to read the rest. I actually saw the movie awhile ago and really wanted to read the book. The movie was stunning I loved every part of it but the book was even better. I loved that I could picture every part of it and I couldn't put the book down.  Every free second I had I was reading the book unable to put it down.  I'm really looking forward to reading all others, especially before I see any other movies, which I wish would come out soon with the second one.  To Suzanne Collins you are an amazing writing an  I loved it! Thank you!!!
B00914JWSW|5.0|What I love about this CD is the music takes you back to the time she sang these songs. Any &#34;real&#34; Streisand fan knows how her voice sounded in the 60's, 70's. 80's and today. All the songs are wonderful, it's Streisand! one word say's it all, Barbra!
B005LAIIQC|4.0|This film may be a bit tough to penetrate at first, but if you are a fan of the Matt Damon Bourne films you will be richly rewarded.  I believe you are intentionally brought into a state of confusion at first, but as the film unwinds and the parallels between the previous movies and this one become apparent, you will begin to smile more and more, until you are a full-on Aaron Cross fan.  Jeremy Renner gives a much-better than average thriller-star performance with this nuanced character, and the action and locations are way above the competition.  Well worth seeing.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|It's one of those movies that you can watch over again and get more from it each time. enjoying this movie a great deal!
B006LSZECO|2.0|Two bad books in a week is two too many.  Just not a good book, in my opinion.....I have not gotten any real sense out of it yet, and frankly doubt I will finish it.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|This was a disappointment.  I don't think I will bother withthis author again--much of it was boring.  Hopefully Ms Cromwell will just retire.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Haven't  even gotten through it - a major disappointment, to me, as it had been highly regarded. if I could undo my purchase, I'd do so!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|super useful, would pay to upgrade if I could connect it to Pandora for music to wake up to since I don't have any on my fire :) but great app use it everyday, and helps me stay on track with regular stuff :)
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved this set!  Allowed me to catch up on missed episodes and prepare for season three.  Would have loved even more behind the scenes extras.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It's one of the best books I've read. I can't wait for her to write another.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|My family is a fan of the franchise so I was looking forward to this installment.  The movie was so bad that I fell asleep and my husband turned it off 30 minutes in and declined to finish watching it when I woke.
B003EY7IUY|5.0|This was in my opinion by far the funniest of the series. just loved it!!! I want to keep reading more and more about Rebecca and Luke and theire life!!!
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Fun game with enough challenge to keep things interesting. Had a couple of instances where the game froze, but I exited the game and restarted without losing my place and was able to continue where I left off. Cute, whimsical storyline, which was a great change (why are so many games dark and gloomy).
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept me in suspense the whole time I was reading it, It was very hard to put it down! The only thing I was annoyed with was the ending. Not giving anything away here but I definitely feel it needs a sequel!!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I don't believe that this is the end of the Bourne frachise, just a brief respite until Matt Damon finds another story to extend Jason Bourne's case. In the meantime, Jeremy Renner fills the void extremely well. Great action flick.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Great Graphics, fun to eat fish and people -<br />Kills time ( when you need too ) easy to use<br />I enjoy the real life feel of the game too.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|The MIB franchise is one of my favorites, but I happen to love action flicks. I realize that they will never win an academy award, but for pure entertainment where the good guys always win and the bad guys always lose, you can't lose.
B000J3Q8U4|1.0|The LIONSGATE copy of Emmanuelle 2 is a copy with edited and missing content. Seven minutes compared to my VHS original. This copy is also small-screen format and when produced at full scale is of poor resolution.  On top of that, the copy is a poor copy that even contains advertising cues.  LIONSGATE usually can be counted on for quality productions, but after producing this unacceptable copy (at a premium price) this buyer will not purchase without complete consumer info.  Wonderful movie once again diminished by a production company who apparently is willing to cheat their customers.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|What can I say. I love action flicks, and Robert Downey Jr. has become one of my favorite action movie actors. Who'd of thought!! I loved it.

0547258305|5.0|Graceling by Kristin Cashmore; Harcourt, 2008<br />I have been waiting for an epic novel filled with fantasy, beautiful lands and of course assassins since my beloved Poison study and I have found it. Graceling is an epic novel filled with politics, fantasy  and of course people that are graced. Our heroine Katsa is a Graced assassin under the regime of an evil king. Po our hero is Graced with the skill of fighting. What happens when the realms best assassin meets the realms best fighter? Fireworks of course.  Graceling is an epic fantasy novel filled with inventive world building, intrigue, political power plays, a gentle passion and lots of fighting. This book is not for the faint of heart. Though it is technically a young adult novel; just because of the characters ages, it is filled with lots of violence. It is a sweeping novel that introduces you to a new world filled with beauty, deception and heartbreak. This is fantasy and romance at its finest. This book is part one of a three part series and trust me, you will read them all.

0547884591|1.0|This is a toal waste of money. Wrong title, poorly organized. This guy has just turned into an egomanic douche and everyone is just falling in line. His first 2 books were good, this one is just ego stroking.
B004SDEP38|5.0|the only way i know of to open password protected MS Office docs on a phone.  Good customer service as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game EVER!!!!!! I have played all three versions before P.C. pocket and XBOX and I can say this game can only get better!
B000FVQM2Y|4.0|Only thing I was unsure about was it sounded like something was loose inside...thought probably the DVD and was hoping it wasn't broken since it seemed to be loose inside during shipping and may have moved around and gotten broken in transit.  But, when she opened it all was well.  Maybe should have been fastened down better somehow.  I'm super satisfied with the end product though and my daughter was excited to get it for Christmas.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Gripping! The twist is unmatched. Sky is so relatable and Holder is so yummy! I really could not put this one down.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Though the case was cracked this didn't compromise the cd. I'm satisfied. I received the album on time. Great service.
B008Y5OWO8|4.0|We have taken so much of what this film introduced to us in 1950 for granted and if there is any doubt as to the great debt film-makers owe to this wonderful director with regards his massive contributions to film-making over his entire lifetime then this film certainly goes a long way in putting all that to rest.  Many already know how my personal favourite Kurosawa film [[ASIN:B003KGBISY Seven Samurai (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]] directly or indirectly influenced films like [[ASIN:B004J04KXU The Magnificent Seven [Blu-ray]]] and even [[ASIN:B000W9DSVW Ocean's Trilogy (Ocean's Eleven / Ocean's Twelve / Ocean's Thirteen) [Blu-ray]]] but Rashomon has influenced too many future films and even tv dramas over the years to even be mentioned.  Every time you see a scene with a direct shot of the sun in it it's because of this film.  It was the first film shot mostly in the depths of the jungle too.  Every time Gregory House states in one of my all time favourite tv series \\"House\\" that \\"everybody lies\\" or every time we get to see alternate possibilities on any CSI episode all this has its genesis here in this brilliant Kurosawa classic.  Kurosawa himself once described this film as an attempt to show that everybody relates events that they have experienced in ways that put them in a favourable light or that no testimony is ever completely objective.  We see this premise here as every witness somehow manages to relate the same event in a way that they feel achieves a positive outcome for them.  Whose story is true?  The viewer will have to decide and for this viewer the answer is a mixture of all the stories but we'll never be sure and unlike [[ASIN:B008M4MB8K Blade Runner (30th Anniversary Collector's Edition) [Blu-ray]]] where Ridley Scott basically tells you if Decker is a replicant or not (at least in the special features documentary of the version that I have) Kurosawa does no such thing here and he leaves you to decide.<br /><br />Thankfully we get Criterion in the driver's seat and not Kino or worse StudioCanal and taking responsibility for the very important task of restoring and making this essential film worthy of a blu-ray release.  The source master isn't perfect but Criterion's effort at picture quality restoration does bear fruit and although it is not perfect you would have to try very hard to detect any obvious imperfections like spots or scratches although they are not completely eliminated.  Also the constrast and picture definition isn't the best that you'll see in other black and white 1080p releases but considering the age of the film they are still quite admirable.

The source master isn't perfect but Criterion's effort at picture quality restoration does bear fruit and although it is not perfect you would have to try very hard to detect any obvious imperfections like spots or scratches although they are not completely eliminated.  Also the constrast and picture definition isn't the best that you'll see in other black and white 1080p releases but considering the age of the film they are still quite admirable.

B00AAX68HG|4.0|This game is a really fun twist on a game like 'traffic'. The focus is on the 'twist'... developers made a cool game that stands alone, has great graphics, entertaining characters, and over all positive fun for any age with enough challenge to stump any puzzle-solving genius.

B002CLBJPK|5.0|Really enjoyed it. More musicals like this should be made for new generations ... but this is tough to beat for simple, good hearted fun.
B00452VF4O|5.0|May contain Spoilers. So don't read, until you have finished the book. What an interesting book about such a significant person in the mid 1200's about whom I had never known anything. Simon De Montfort, a saint in his time and memorialized as the father of the English Parliment system after his time. Worshippers attended his grave site for hundreds of years after his terrible death. His life was marked by courage and principle. He dared to oppose a weak and destructive English King, Henry III. Extending democracy in his Provisions restricting the King to trades people, knights, and city mayors was indeed revolutionary. De Montfort tried to lesson the effect of just having the \\"blood ruling class, born and bred\\" and let more of the common folk have a say in their own lives. Truly a George Washington of his time. A wonderful love story between Simon and his wife Nell, the king's sister. I knew how things were going to turn out, knowing that Henry's cruel son Edward Longshanks of Braveheart fame would ultimately triumph, made this a tear jerker for me. It is so sad when good men don't prevail.
B008H6GH8I|5.0|I enjoy the live action Resident Evil movies too, don't get me wrong.  But you have to look at them as just fun movies.  If you are a big fan of the RE video games as I am, these CG movies are much better, add to the real story from the games and use the same voice actors from the games.  When you're watching Claire or Leon, you are watching the same characters from the games, not some live actor's interpretation of the character.  And it's (almost) always disappointing when, for example, the live actor of Claire Redfield is just not like the Claire from the games, in looks or mannerisms.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is so addicting. I can't put it down. Very fun, very funny. Great for kids and adults.  Well worth paying for the full version.
B009MF56GC|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable movie, fun and entertaining from beginning to end with great tributes to the action films of the 80s and 90s.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|if it didn't cut out on its own it would be perfect other then that no complaints keep it up guys
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is a great version of the game for you to play during down time. It is easy to use.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This isn't like the kind of books I read. But it's the best I've read. I really like the way Charlie's character develops throughout the book.
B0010KG2NS|4.0|it was fantastic thanks it turned up in not to bada time but i have got it now it will now injoy watching it
1423140605|5.0|I like the Percy Jackson series. The book is awesome. I love everything about the series. I would recomend it to all Percy Jackson fan's.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Nothing special about this. Good length and solid power ups for my Kindle. Does it's job, no breaks, no complaints.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|I've had this game for quite some time now and have gotten hours of game play from it. As others have stated, the best part is creating all the new combinations. Some are obvious, some are hilarious, and some don't really make sense. Regardless of which one you happen to create, in the end it's still extremely entertaining.<br /><br />To take it a step further, you could even play with a friend! No no, not like words with friends. I mean sit in a room with someone who also has the app and see who can create combinations faster! Eventually yes, it gets to the point that you're wracking your brain trying to figure out what combination you could possibly make with what you already have. That's just part of the game! You can either keep trying, have a friend give it a whirl, or Google it!<br /><br />Highly recommend. You may not play it all day every day, but it's a great time waster!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This longer version has better character development and more detail, so much so, that I didn't recognize the movie, the second time I watched it.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case literally fell apart within 4 days of having it.. I gave it to my sister as a gift and it was in pieces only after a few days. I guess this is life-proof, not sister-proof
B0047SF41G|5.0|Predators is a really awesome thriller, along with good actors. I've always liked the Predators series especially the first 1 with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The character building and the plot lacked depth, however the author did a great job with progression. The simplicity of this book is comparable to fairy tales. That wistful quality is what intrigued me.<br /><br />The down side of this story is that it's written at the level of a middle school student or younger, but it contains strong sexual themes. It seems to be fitted to a simple minded female in her early twenties. I'm sure that group has a lot of potential for a professional writer, but I would rather see the author push her artistic limits and write at her own level if that is at all possible.<br /><br />I suppose the bottom line is that though Colleen Hoover spins cleverly twisted plots, she plays plays it safe everywhere else.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cried. A lot. Because you think you know what's going to happen and you don't know. You think that it will be alright again, but it won't. This is my now all time favorite book. Ever, and I read a LOT of books. I write stories on my laptop. But this kept me on my toes, unable to put it down. You don't know what your missing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun game my whole family plays. We have competitions to see who can get the most points in an hour.
B008K8U13K|4.0|My 6yr old downloaded (prior to me setting a PW) It keeps him busy when he is on the Kindle.
B0099G3I96|5.0|No Doubt sounds better than ever. I have fallen in love with this album.  If you are a fan of ska or Gwen you should get this album anyway possible. I promise you will groove to every track.
B006LSZECO|1.0|These are two self serving people feeding on each other!  Didn't like it at all!  And of course they are both crazy!
B007FH22VQ|4.0|I enjoy this album.  However, after being listening to early albums its hard to rate this one.  Tracks that stand out are Behind the Sun, and Break those bones.  I can not quite make it through the album without skipping a few tracks.  So while being good it is not great.  I favor ObZen over this one.  ObZen in my mind, is a hard album to follow.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Susan Boyle is phenomenal, remarkable, exceptional, extraordinary, amazing, astonishing, astounding, sensational, stunning, incredible, unbelievable; marvelous, magnificent, wonderful, outstanding, singular, out of the ordinary, unusual, unprecedented; fantastic, terrific, tremendous, stupendous, awesome, out of this world; wondrous.<br /><br />She reminds me that there is good in this world. I would love to meet her. I would love to be her best friend. I am so happy for her.<br /><br />Her voice is so clear. She and Donny make a great duet. He sounds great. I could listen to her forever. There are so many songs I'd love to hear her sing. I'm sorry that \\"I know him so well\\" is not on this compilation - either alone or with Elaine Page.<br /><br />A new \\"over the rainbow\\" arrangement and I love it!<br /><br />I love that I can hear her voice.  The orchestra does not drown her out. I could listen to her voice forever.  Thank you, Susan!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|While I enjoyed the movie, the book has so much more to offer. Very well-written, insightful, deep. I highly recommend it.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|My friends boys are huge green day fans. they loved it so i also bought them the second one for a christmas gift.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Just another fine, intriguing book by Lee Child. A always, you'll want to keep on reading and not put it down. Baldacci eat your heart out.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Very suspenseful. Hard to put down. Great ending with A surprise. A good read. Love Harry Bosch novels  so exciting.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|It kills time and it was free! It is fun and the progress gets really hard! Give it a try!!!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Connelly, once again, keeps readers on the edge of their seats with another Harry Bosch mystery. It was difficult to put this one down as Harry continues to evolve as a man in front of us with each new installment. His growth as a single father who is dating, but cognizant of all that it entails, all while keeping his work as a detective front and center is particularly endearing, especially to someone who's been there himself. Well done Mr. Connelly!
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Neeson is perfect for this movie and did an amazing job.  Would highly recommend this movie to anybody that likes action and suspense!!!
B00003CXRM|5.0|This all came packaged nice and in brand new sealed container,  I loved the movie I have not seen it in years but so enjoyed watching it again I laughed through out and the music and placing of music in the scenes was a great part of this movie and the charcters are all so fasinating . If you never seen this movie it is a must see get it rent what ever just watch it.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I've read these since the 3rd grade and still love them! Unlike other authors, Jeff Kinney really does know how kids feel and embarrassing experiences teenagers and middle schoolers go through with parents and siblings! I'm just kinda disappointed because this only took me 30 to read, which questions if it's worth the money. But I still had some laugh out loud moments!!
B004X60QE2|5.0|Arrived in a timely manner and in great condition.  My daughter and I have both enjoyed watching it.  We were fortunate to meet Colin Ferguson this past April at a Comic Convention in Toronto Canada.  He was so intriguing that I watched Season Six and ordered Season One.
B00992CF6W|5.0|When I first watched my nephew play this game I thought that it was so stupid, but my 5 year old wanted it so I downloaded it to my kindle fire and now I even enjoy playing it with her.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I would give this an A+ rating.  My daughter, grandson and I saw it at the theater and we were glad that it came out on DVD before Christmas.  I would recommend purchase of this to anyone.
B009D5VNLS|4.0|My family loves this movie and it is a lot of fun to watch. We still watch it at least once a week.
0446554995|5.0|I love Douglas Preston books.  I have not had the opportunity to read it yet as I just got it got Christmas.  Would recommend any of these author's books.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|But it did seem to drag at times. But all in all it was  really good story. I would recommend it
B000NQRE9Q|3.0|It's great to have the old movies in Blu-Ray.<br />The bonus features are great.<br />Spielberg pretty much admits that &#34;Temple of Doom&#34; sucked, and kinda blames Lucas.<br /><br />But, damn, &#34;Crystal Skull&#34; is horrific. And the bonus features make it seem even worse.
B008VBYN80|4.0|It's a great game! I was looking for a build and battle game (ie....civilization) and this works great. My only complaint is that if your impatient like me you have to buy energy to stay ahead.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Castle is an awesome show!!!! I'm a huge Nathan Fillion fan I loved him in firefly!!!! Can't wait to see the rest of season five!!!!
B004QX07G4|5.0|Amazing, she is so funny and I honestly didn't think she would be a good writer but i was wrong.
1401322786|1.0|This book is a religious fable/fantasy.<br /><br />Here is the plot: A young man named Dor begins to measure time. He lives in a prehistoric society. With him, this task is almost an obsession. But he has a wife who gets sick. He runs for a doctor. Then God enters the story. God puts him in cave as punishment for \\"discovering time\\". He stays in the cave for thousands of years listening to human voices complaining about time. Two of these voices belong to Sarah and Victor. They live in modern times. God moves Dor out of the cave to interact with them. At the end, God sends Dor back in time to his dying wife.<br /><br />Perhaps, if you are religious (or sympathize with mysticism), you can tolerate this unrealistic story.  If you are looking for a philosophical discussion of time you will be disappointed.<br /><br />PS. I have not read Albom's earlier books. I do not intend to do so.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app! I use it everyday very helpful!<br />It pinpoints many out of the way locations which makes it great for traveling.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|Live in London...almost as good as seeing them in person.  I couldn't get to see this concert so love watching it over and over!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I have read all of the Percy Jackson series. This one, was a good one and I highly recommend it to everyone else who has either read the past books or not.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This was well worth the long read. The short stories make it easy  to pick up and put down without losing anything. The stories themselves are a treasure to read. The characters are intense and lively and the plots are fun and entertaining. Doyle's descriptive abilities make 19 th century England!!d come alive.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I think this game is not only fun it is the bomb this is awesome and the best game ever for littlest pet shop
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was just as good as the first, it pulled me right into the continuing story. Can't wait to get into the next book
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|I think the cabin fever was the best one . And this one needs to improve a lot . Kk
B008MM9630|5.0|I am pleasantly surprised at how well this play's on the kindle fire hd. The farm is gorgeous graphic wise. Play is smooth and glitch free. So far I have not needed to buy anything,although you can if you want. A must try if you like farm games.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am skeptical of many sci fi books because the science is so implausible & too often the plots become yet another space opera. Not so with Andy Weir' s debut The Martian. An unlikely hero becomes stranded on Mars & the race for survival is on. The story is told through the journals & communications of the main character & his colleagues, making for an amusing, touching, & page turning read. Funny, suspenseful, and very very real - The Martian does not disappoint. Lots of science & McGyver-ish moments make this geeky action story a hit for just about anyone, although Weir' s characters speak candidly, ie, dropping f bombs when things go bad in a hurry, as most folks do! I couldn't' put this book down & could imagine a great movie being made of this! Highly recommended.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I like this one a lot, especially because when he ties together all the loose ends, I was both impressed and relieved that the victim and her family finally received justice.  Definitely a page turner!
B00008G9JM|5.0|What is next from these guys after TAAB?  APP.  Wow, and they even topped TAAB in my book.  Ian Anderson has quoted that this crazy piece of work is one of his faves in the JT catalog, and crazy it is.  The changes throughout are more severe than TAAB, and take you on a prog rock journey through a renaissance faire setting that is unreal, and not matched with anything you have heard today.<br /><br />What can you expect?  Some sax (not present on many other Tull stuff), complex time signatures (duh), and the typical Tull 'bringing it all together' from start to finish on the concept masterpiece.  I particularly like the irreverent Ian at his best on this one (think 'Wind Up' plus 10).<br /><br />There always seems to be a lot of talk about the 'Hare who lost his spectacles'.  Who cares - it is a waste of time, and they must have been stoned when Tull thought this was an 'valuable addition' to this masterpiece.  Hey, just my opinion....<br /><br />APP...is one of the BEST Progressive rock CD's ever...get it now!!!
0891419063|5.0|I did not read the Okinawa part.  (Sorry)  But the Peleliu part helped me understand what my young uncle went through before he died there.  For that, I am very grateful.  It also helped me understand some often misunderstood aspects of the war in the Pacific.  Very good book.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|I have loved this album (now CD) for years, and this it one that really stands the test of time.  Jeez, I must sound like an old 'classic rocker'...guess I just am.  I love Nightwish, My Chemical Romance, Epica, etc...so don't put me off as some ole fuddy duddy rocker.  I am very specific about the rock music I listen to, and I don't have time for old stuff that bores me or has really dated itself.  BOSTON just never fell in that category, as well as other bands from that time (FMac, Foriegner, Cars, etc), and what I have always liked about them (especially after listening to more new stuff like Staind/Korn) is that the music from then was always so POSITIVE.  Life sucks most of the time, and I really don't need some rock band telling me that!!  On the other side, I do not live in a fantasy world where nothing is bad, but heck, I rather have more positive music than negative now and then. Give me some 'Peace of Mind'!!!<br /><br />After all that, yes, BOSTON really rocks...think 'Don't Stop Believing' from Journey for the power of great 70's-80's rock....
B00466HM28|5.0|it love that i can use it on any programs in the computer with any vst, and the pad that comes with it, it awesome when you know how to program it properly
B00000AOUD|5.0|I cannot belive it has been 40 years since I bought the old LP with that cool fake newspaper that followed up the classic Aqualung...  BIG LP to follow, but I just loved the fact that Ian Anderson just said 'well, this is what we want to do next, and here it is'.  I am not sure if the record company really approved his approach on this one, but it was a true 'home run' - it went #1 in no time. I don't think there has been a 'concept prog rock album' that has done this in quite awhile.<br /><br />JT is one of my fave bands, and TAAB still sounds great today.  Some bands from days gone by still sound great, but JT's stuff is awesome and stands the test of time like other band's cannot.<br /><br />There are bands today doing the concept prog rock thing (Dream Theater, Spock's Beard, Transatlantic, etc) - mind you their roots are with JT and others (Genesis, ELP, etc), but it is great to know that the concept/themed CD is not dead!!  But back to this gem...if you have not heard it, you will not be disappointed at all if you like prog rock.  As others have mentioned, this CD is in the hall of fame of prog rock with Foxtrot, Close to the Edge/Fragile, Tarkus, etc.  A lot of people hate this kind of music, but there are many that love it...and if you do, TAAB MUST be in your collection!!!  In 1 more year, 'A Passion Play' is up...another one of JT's 'single song' gems that Ian still says it is one of his faves...get this one too while you are at it!!!
0385737955|4.0|**MINOR SPOILERS**<br />Let me just say that I am NOT a fan of the Hunger Games. However, I found the Maze Runner much more interesting. The characters such as Minho, Newt, Alby, Gally, and Thomas were all very different. Once the new girl arrived, everyone except Thomas hated her. They accused her of being the cause and fall of the maze. Thomas was the only person who trusted her. After a while, Thomas and Teresa started to communicate in their heads, sharing clues they discovered about the maze.<br /><br />The reason I give this book four stars is because some things were not very clear such as the Griever hole. Towards the end of the book when Thomas and Minho discoverer the Griever hole, I felt like James Dashner did't fully describe its surroundings and how it worked. I did not feel like I was... there. I was also disappointed by how many characters practically committed suicide. I will however, look forward to the second book.
0307594165|5.0|I was helping another person buy this book.<br />My computer illiterate friends ask me to buy books for them.<br />It is easy for me to purchase an extra book for them.<br />the difficult part is to write a review about something so impersonal.
159514188X|5.0|This book is about an already heavy topic so I expected some intense moments but there was something about it that left me hanging on until the very end and even then, when I turned the last page, I still wanted to know more. It makes you think about the way you treat people and how the littlest things can really shatter someones world. It arrived on time and I am happy I read it, It's not the best book I have ever read but it was definitely worth reading.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|A lo t of fun personalizing the island a shooting octopus it gets complicated managing all th  little pirates but figuring out their strengths and weakness if fun to
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I will say that this series of books are the best that I have ever read. I love the main characters and they way that they are described.  I find my self laughing and crying and sitting on the edge of my seat, I have just started book 5 I don't want them to end.<br />DW<br />Utah
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I LOVE this app!!!! Was dissappointed it was 3 bucks...but it was worth it. There is a wash, dye, perm, style, picture, and accessory station. You can grow the hair, or dye it, or cut it, or shave it....ANYTHING!!!!! it is really REALLY fun!!! The people look and act silly... but its still fun. I love taking pix of each style so I can see how much better I got the more I played! GET IT!!!!!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|Great book. I would recommend to anybody interested in making improvement to themselves. Reading it on a Kindle or computer helped since there are many links to other sights that are helpful to understanding the concepts provided in the book.
0345803485|5.0|The best books I ever read I couldn't put them down I read all three in 2 weeks then ran my life till I was done and oh how I wished I was her...I really hoping for another fourth book even if its just a continuing of their life ill be happy and an actual movie of the whole story so I can watch it that would be the greatest ever in my lifetime and I would love to meet the author...she should have an announced book signing in the United States
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game was a great beginning game for our 10 year old.  He started with this game and has gone on to more different angry birds since.  He still goes back to this one once in a while.  This company has a great thing going with these birds and pigs.  Great games for kids!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The story line was good but the book was a little to technical for me, but I would recommend it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game!  It reminds me of when we would go to the carnival and use quarters to try to win prizes.  It is something I play every chance I get.  Great game!
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This is a story within a story.  The 10-minute encounter between enemies is really not the story.  It's really a biography of Franz Stigler and a fulcrum for a larger story about the war.  The concept is really excellent but honestly I wish a more experienced author had tackled it.  I thought it was a little too goodie-goodie much of the time.  Franz Stigler is portrayed as \\"the good German\\" who hated the Nazis but fought for Germany and his dead brother.<br /><br />Somehow I have to think there was more to the story.  The author depicts larger currents of anti-Nazi feelings among Franz's associates -- I wish this had been developed more thoroughly and credibly.  I'm not saying it's not credible, I'm just saying that the saccarine approach to the story made me feel that it was more like a Readers Digest story than a history book.<br /><br />The book could also benefit from tighter editing.  Many scenes are written as if the author was right there or the subjects had photographic memories of events long passed.  My guess is that during his interviews and research that the author learned a lot of general things (e.g., like how a BF 109 sounds when it starts up) and he weaves these into the story as if Franz and others were recounting all of these details.  Some facts are repeated several times and some are just down-right inaccurate (e.g., there were no \\"transistor chips\\" in WW II radios).<br /><br />But there's no doubt that this is a page-turner.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This game is fun but VERY challenging.  My little guy complains that it is too hard - but that is good for him.  Keep up the great games!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I Loved it! I was engrossed and my family could not tear me away from reading Suzanne Collins' trilogy. Will re-read.
B008MEM24S|4.0|10 year old says - &#34;this game is kinda creepy, kinda crazy and really weird. Creepy because he makes household items into evil minions. Crazy because these items kinda resemble him (Dr. D).  Weird because Dr. D wants to make household items into his own evil agency.&#34;
B007FG9LIE|5.0|This book was definitely a book that kept you wondering what was going to happen next. It definitely didn't end the way you expected.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|The game is pretty cool according to our 10 year old.  He especially likes this game because of the changing seasons all in one game.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|Audio fluctuated wildly and storyline was out there...very disappointing!  I would only watch this if HBO or Showtime had on--don't pay for it!
B008K8VDPU|5.0|This is a fantastic way to start teaching our kiddo the piano.  He is learning piano and music at the same time.  Great game.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book.  Cleverly written from various characters viewpoints.  I cried but mostly laughed.  Everyone will wish they had a friend like Auggie.  What a remarkable story.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I like that this game helps our 10 year old to start learning the piano and love music.  It is a great game for learning and still having fun at the same time.  Thanks for that.
B0066WJLU6|4.0|This seems to work well. It is very bright and is much better than I expected.I didn't it to fill the entire screen.
B0041KVXLK|5.0|It was the summer of 1967. I was 14 and 1/2 years old, the biggest Beatle Fan of all my friends and the much anticipated \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" album was almost ready for release! Finally, the day had come, as I raced down to the local music store! I bought it and brought it home. I stared at the strange but cool artwork as I unwrapped the package. I put it on our Sears StereoPhonic Turnable (how modern!) amd adjusted the bass and tremble controls.<br />Of course, I had every album to date, and was nervous about this new one. Would it be better than the last one?? Would I like it?<br />I played all the songs....and then.... \\"A Day In The Life\\" came on. I was mesmorized! It was the BEST song I had ever heard! I played it over....and over...and over! I could not get enough of this song! Especially the end, where the last chord takes 36 seconds to fade away! Unbelevable!!  And it still is....45 and 1/2 years later!!
B002C97C12|4.0|Haven't viewed it fully, but gave it as a gift and the receiver made a comment  the packaging looked old. Great experience so far!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good book.<br />If you like epic love stories you will like this book. I think every woman deep down would like to have a fifty shades man.
0345525558|4.0|This book touched my heart.  Victoria is a victim of the foster care system, and of a caseworker who is less than compassionate.  Some parts broke my heart.  Flipping back and forth between present day and when Victoria was 10 and living with a foster parent, I couldn't help but feel sorry for how this little girl/ young woman was failed by the system.  Skepticism, mistrust and lack of self-worth severely compromises her ability to love.  Yet along the way she meets people who fall in love with her.  She just doesn't see it.<br /><br />I found myself cheering her on the whole time and I was very happy with how she was able to make something of herself.  I gave this 4 stars rather than 5 because I felt the ending was a little too predictable.<br /><br />This is a book, however, that is worth reading!
B006LSZECO|4.0|A friend of mine told me about this book, I didn't know much about it but I was surprised by how good it is. It's a kind of book that keep you reading, you don't want to stop until you are done. For people who like unexpected events, this is THE book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love the variety in this CD! Bought for my mom for Christmas and the whole family ended up buying copies. The piano guys are very talented and unique!
0446554995|5.0|Long time fan, read every book of D&L. This one is among the best and worth the wait. Good story that keeps you guessing.<br /><br />Spolier Alerts below:<br /><br />I have been waiting for Diogenes for while and though he almost made it in this one but seems like the writers want him to stay dead for now and instead comes Albun who seems to be a younger and better version of Diogenes. I still would like to see Diogenes one of these days. Ther chemistry was out of this world, the good and evil brother.<br />Corrie Swanson's side story was totally unrelated to the rest of the book, Dr. Fleder's story at least had Constance in it so was relevant. But her you get 3 in 1 stories in this book. Not bad.<br />You have to go deep into fiction in this book as some of the ideas are pretty far fetched but again it is fiction and I loved it.<br />Waiting for their next one.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book is great and touching. It makes you believe that fairy tales really do exist!!!!! A must read. Enjoy.
B001229HEK|5.0|It's not for everybody but it is great.  I think that even people who only sort of like metal bands can find something to like.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Nerf has done wonders with the new color scheme!  I love the look of this blaster, but I am a bit worried about the durability of the handle that you cock to change clips!  I am sure Nerf has done multiple tests and in the long run the blaster will outlast me!  The entire Nerf Nation was excited to increase the ammo amount that you be able to shoot!  I have put a 35 drum along with an 18 drum and even added the 25!  It's great not to have to keep reloading a 6 dart capacity clip!  Over all I am proud to have the hail fire as a new edition to my collection!  It's look is just great!  Reminds me of a lazy Susan!  For those too young, you won't understand it so those of you who do - your just old like me!  Nerf or Nothin!
0739378341|4.0|The work is very well written and being a lawyer I enjoyed its language. However the story is highly improbale and complicated and at times a bit contrived. But then isn't all fictional creations more or less contrived? I have read or viewed all the works of John Grisham who has attained international stature beyond the confines of the United States.
B005OP7162|5.0|I don't usually commit to watching any show for a whole season.  My friend kept telling me that I needed to watch Revenge and that I wouldn't be disappointed.  I finally did and I am addicted! Love it!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Good movie that has a little action to it, great story, with some historical significance to it.  I haven't read the book this was based on, but this movie had made it worth looking into.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a wonderful game, a nice way to gently exercise your mind. I like that each segment has a time limit
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My 2 year old daughter loves these kids.  I admit, I'm not a fan, not my cup of tea, but I'm an old dad now, and that's how it's supposed to be.  She loves the single that came out, but after having watched the video on tv a few times was disappointed to learn that this CD didn't have the video as well.
0345803485|1.0|The story as a whole is okay but does it deserve such high praise and ratings?  Personally, there is nothing extraordinary about this book.  It does not deserve all the attention it is receiving.  It is just a plain story with some sexual elements which will shock only those who never read such things ever before.<br /><br />I would call it Mills & Boons with some little extra sex.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Andre Rieu does not have one bad program.  Every one of his vidoes is so very entertaining.  This one is fantastic and shows how he relates to every one of his audiences.  So enjoyable we watch often.
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|Movie is as good as any of the movies in the Ice Age series. I would recomend this movie to anyone young at heart.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey is now one of my favorite authors.  Period.  I read Wool 1 as free selection on my Kindle.  When I finished; I had to have more! And I got more than \\"more\\" with Wool 2, 3, 4, and 5!  He makes you feel like you are right there with each character...like you are right next to them, not observing from a distance.  Almost a sense of tolerable claustrophobia that plays right in with the plot.  I just purchased First Shift and Second Shift, the next two books of this series.  I can't wait to find out what happens next!  Thanks Hugh!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. The note pad that wrote down your clues was awesome. I will be looking for another of these games.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I absolutely love it. What would we do without it.  Please don't stop making angry birds. My daughter that has cerebral palsy LOVES this game
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a very great game. Personally i like having to earn coins and able to buy gadgets and jetpacks! This is a really good game! By the way, if your character is flying with out you tapping anything. Exit out, put on sleep, wipe off your screen, play!! I hope i helped! :)
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This knife was a gift for my husband and he loved it and his friend wants to get one now too. It is a sturdy knife and it arrived very quick.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|Seriously speechless. There are no other words to express how I feel about this book. It's magnificently written, and I'm extremely exasperated that the third book isn't done for me to start reading. I loved the 50 shades trilogy, but I must say this series is outstanding. I pre ordered the third book even before  I started reading the first book. I'm glad to say I don't regret it at all.
B008KW43TE|4.0|I didn't expect a lot from this album, no offense.  This just isn't really my genre.  I liked how different Thinkin bout you sounded and the price was enticing so I bought it.  Well, to my surprise I like more than half of these songs and there are a few I just love.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book tugs and tugs hard at the emotions but over all its something that you will never want to put down. I love it so much, it's also something I can relate too.
B00A17AD36|3.0|I tried to listen to this trilogy but the songs are too similar and I feel like this could've been reduced to 12 songs....  I've given this several listens and have found maybe 5 songs I like.  Maybe with the proper meds I would've felt differently.<br /><br />**I just changed my review from 2 stars to 3 stars.  I still feel like there is a lot of space filler on this trilogy but I've now found about 7 likeable songs.  I have yet to obey his commands in track 1 (as title suggests) and this whole album would probably transform into something magical if I did.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I love these \\" coming of age\\" stories. This one was really touching and beautiful and is easily one of my favorite books
1936608618|4.0|As a triathlete and marathoner, I want to learn how to use crossfit to balance my exercise regimen.  I thought that this book would give me an actual program to follow, which it doesn't.  It does have a lot of useful information on proper running, swimming, and cycling technique, but I still am unsure how to put everything together in an effective training plan.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|There is very clear audio when i wear it on my collar, but there is a large amount of noise that it picks up. It could be easily covered with a quiet music overlay while you talk, but its still there. Considering the price, its great and efficient.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|My husband and I found this very entertaining.  Being close to the age of the Marigold Hotel residents there were parts that were a little TOO familiar but that made the movie that much more entertaining.
0307720950|3.0|I enjoyed this book but an important chapter was left out: what fields does the maker ideology not apply to? Who opposes innovation, \\"do it yourself\\" (D-I-Y) hobbyists, open source or distributed knowledge, and cooperative communities of users?<br /><br />Anderson's examples are all toys, more or less: radio-controlled model airplanes, World War Two weapons for Lego sets, a fish tank for jellyfish, a \\"Baja racer\\" (dune buggy?) kit car. His organizational model of enthusiastic customers creating new designs and voluntarily fixing code only works with hobbyists. I work in medical technology; the \\"maker\\" ideology doesn't apply. Licensed medical professionals are adamantly opposed to innovations that threaten their income and/or prestige (read: guarded knowledge). I've been trying to get people with speech disorders to volunteer to code speech samples for researchers, using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. This would cut the time and expense of research in half or less, as well as enable people with speech disorders to feel they are \\"doing something\\" to advance research in the field. The charitable organizations, professional organizations, and government grant providers oppose this. I could go on with many other examples. Anderson has a chapter about D-I-Y DNA labs, but he says that all they've done is check if sushi bars are passing off cheaper fish for expensive species.<br /><br />A couple minor complaints: \\"cool\\" and \\"ultimate\\" are used way too often. Anderson needs a word processor that beeps annoyingly when he types those words. He also uses the phrase \\"a dog's breakfast\\" when the correct phrase is \\"a dog's dinner,\\" meaning an unpleasant-looking mixture of different items. (My dog just finished his dinner of rice, olive oil, doggie nutritional powder, grated cheese, a pork chop, and pizza for dessert. The phrase doesn't apply to all dogs!)
1401207529|5.0|Arguable the best batman story ever written.  a retelling of batman's origin which was one of the firsts to have batman shed the campy &#34;superhero&#34; teeny-bopper feel.  this singlehandedly made batman into the dark knight born of the dirty, putrid depths of the dregs of gotham city.  this is what made frank miller the best in many people's minds
B005GFPZYK|4.0|An interesting book about an American Seal who was a sniper in the military.  It talks about the training demands, the demands of a soldier in combat as well as the demands of adjustment returning from a deployment to family life.  It is a much read for all military families who have family members who have been deployed.
B005LAII8K|5.0|in a day when it seems every single big budget movie comes from a book adaption a remake or a sequel, comes a original endlessly entertaining film.  although it is a &#34;sic-fi&#34; movie with some similar themes we see in other orwellian/dystopian future movies, looper presents theme themes with its own twists and presents them in its own way that renews them and washes them of the generic stigma they have gained over the years of uninspired, bloated screenplays.  buy it for yourself, you won't be disappointed.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A mililary understanding of who one trains and then is assisted to go after and help bring down Osama Ben Landen.  I helpful book for families who have family members on a deployment and what they much go through in their training.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Interesting true scenarios to illustrate the principles that get to the roots of habit formation. Easy to see the relationship habit has to business decisions; harder to apply to personal habits but not impossible to determine with a little study of comparisons.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|This item arrived ahead of the scheduled date.  It was in excellent condition.  I saw the previews for this movie, and I had to have it.  I would recommend this item to others.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Excellent read. The book was well written with a lot of unpredictable twists.The main characters are unforgetable Must download and read!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I loved this game.  I usually play Big Fish Games but the never HOG's on Amazon for Kindle fir hd are great and really improving.  ,This game is definitely worth the $. Enjoy it !
B005WYFLNU|5.0|Great alternative to a messy craft! We have several Melissa & Doug Sticker Pads and they are all high quality and the kids LOVE them! Great quality and value
B001C08RHA|2.0|Well, the production values are good but the story is pretty forgettable.  Totally formulaic and predictable, i'm surprised that Marvel doesn't have better writers to offer.  Lacks the biting sense of humor that Robocop had, for example.  Disappointing.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|love Lady Gaga and got this for a great deal a long time ago on Amazon. This is a great, fun cd
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I heard about the book long ago but never got around to reading it. The protagonist being a dog kind of put me off. I don't know why. I loved WATERSHIP DOWN, and that was all rabbits!<br /><br />Anyway, when I finally picked it up, I really enjoyed it. So much that I had trouble putting it down.<br /><br />The story starts off with the older Enzo, a golden lab, waiting for his master. But we immediately see this dog is special. He's near the end of his life and knows it. He watches TV--he learned from a documentary that Mongolians believe dogs are reincarnated as humans. He adores Denny, his owner/racecar driver, and wants the best for him.<br /><br />From that beginning, when we know this isn't going to have a happy ending, we're drawn into Enzo's life. This is his memoir, and the story of Denny and Denny's wife and daughter as seen through Enzo's eyes.<br /><br />Racing in the rain comes into play literally because Denny knows how to drive so well in the rain; but it's also a metaphor for life and struggling through life's rains. Like the sickness and loss of a wife, like the fight to retain a daughter.<br /><br />And through it all, Enzo offers support and understanding.<br /><br />Yes, I cried. Couldn't help it.<br /><br />Good book.
B0037UUZQY|4.0|This doll is typical quality you would expect for any barbie doll. My 4 year old loves playing with her.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a counselor at my college after reviewing my results of a personality test that confirmed that I was an introvert. She explained it to me the best that she could but recommended this book to me because she felt that it would be a better way to explain exactly why that meant. After reading this book, rushed light on many of the things I was experiencing and feeling while I was growing up and even in this current day. It brought up many memories from my childhood (some  good and some bad) that caused me to think about what really was going on. I feel more empowered by the words from this book and I am confident that was at least on of the hope of this book. I intend to share this book with all my friends and family both introverted and extroverted in hopes that they can not only gain a greater understanding of the why I think, speak, and act the way I do, but also help then to come to create  way to interact with people of the opposite ends of the introvert/extrovert personality whether they are introvert and extrovert. I really feel that this book could be one of the keys to help people get along with each other.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book confused me for a couple of chapters but it needed to be like that so you understand the feelings and emotions of each character and the relationships they have with each other. I highly recommended this book, it's not like any other romantic love story that I have read.
B0041T52S6|5.0|I love the movie. It has losts of geekyness. There is never a boring moment. It comes with a lot of extras and a different ending in the special featers. If you like video games, rock, and comicbook style violence you'll like this movie.

B00005V9IL|5.0|A movie for everyone:  like submarines?  like aliens?  like mystery?  like adventure?  You've got it!  Plus for those of you who are &#34;softees&#34; there is also love and sweetness!
034580404X|5.0|I loved all 3 books. People will enjoy it or dislike it for different reasons. For me, I looked passed all the sex that was in the book and enjoyed the love story of Fifty Shades ( Christian ) and Anastasia. It was not your usual love/romance story but that is what make this book different. I can't wait for the movie. 2015 can't come fast enough
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I rented this on Amazon streaming for my son, who really liked Iron Man. The movie has a ridiculous plot (don't they all?), but credit has to be given to the actors, who are almost believable, except for the stoic Captain America who could be replaced by a cardboard cutout with detracting from the film. The special effects and CGI get five stars, with amazing detail and remarkable action sequences. Samuel Jackson does a fantastic job of playing, well, Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />Some of the scenes are quite violent which make the movie unsuitable for younger, sensitive viewers.<br /><br />Amazon streaming gets 1 star, as it seems to &#34;hiccup&#34; if you pause the movie. I've noticed this on all of their streaming videos, and it makes me hesitant to rent from Amazon.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love this game.I might be only 9 but I do have a reason to like this game so much! At first I couldn't do it<br />but as soon as I learned how to play I loved it! Every time<br />I get on my kindle fire I would go straight to this one amazing &amp; fun game. I am now officaly a gamer! But not the arcade or the wii kind or the x-box kind.<br />But the kindle fire subway surfers kind!!!

B0041KVZ18|3.0|Yesterday I received my copy of the 180 gram 2012 remastered \\"White Album\\". The vinyl is noisy. Lots of clicks and pops for an \\"audiophile\\" record. Record 1 is slightly warped, record 2 is OK. But what made me return the set for a replacement is the fact that Side 2 in both records was pressed OFF CENTER. Record 1 was worse, as Record 2 was \\"tolerable\\". One would have thought - then again, you'd have to think like an EMI record executive: damn the quality!! Churn them faster and cash in as quickly as possible - that being such as special album from The Beatles, and that people would be willing to pay the extra bucks for the quality - that they'd take EXTRA care in selecting the pressing plant and that the factory would have better quality control procedures as they do in Japan: defective records to be destroyed and re-pressed. Neither the records nor the sticker on the plastic seal reveal where the records were manufactured: The label has green hand writing both on top and bottom of the apple photo, like in British, European, Australian or Japanese releases. I don't know if American releases adopted the European Apple label design for this particular album (the original label had a larger apple picture and no writing, save for \\"manufactured by Apple\\" or \\"Capitol\\" records - and pressed on nosier (inferior) vinyl). In any case, I am waiting for the seller to reply and if I get a replacement, I hope it will be a better copy. It just makes me so angry that in this day and age, vinyl pressings are still as myerda as ever, if not worse, than the awful American vinyl quality in the 1970s.
B00181JGI2|5.0|hadn't seen this in years, I was looking for Grumpier Old Men and stumbled on The Big Lebowski.  What a great flick and it still showcases the versitility of Jeff Bridges.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is an absolutely amazing game that helps pass time and is absolutely addicting I love how there is so many games and it can keep you occupied for a long time. this game is about having fun and trying to get to the end and finish all the games.

B008HK3XU4|5.0|Nice case, seems to be good quality.  Just bought it for our daughter for Christmas and so far so good.
B007712XAU|5.0|I just finished watching Season 1 & 2 ordered through Amazon.  There were many versions and I hoped I ordered the correct one.  The box says &#34;Original UK Edition&#34;, Carnival Films.  Some reviews I read before ordering claimed the Christmas episode was not included.  Mine HAD the episode.  We really enjoyed rewatching before season 3 begins.
1423140605|5.0|A prophecy once again, \\"Seven Half-Bloods shall answer the call. To storm or fire the world must fall. An oath to keep with a final breath and foes bear arms to the Doors of Death.\\" The prophecy of the seven confuses all of the half-bloods at Camp Half-Blood. However, more disturbing is the fact that a stolen away brain washed Roman boy named Jason Grace inhabits Camp Half-Blood. While he is there he discovers that he has been switched with the famed Percy Jackson. Now, Percy, who is also brain washed is living in Camp Jupiter (Roman). Was this trade by Hera done on purpose? Of course!  Together these two great half- bloods will unite the Greeks and Romans and create the team of seven. Together they will have to stop Gaia from rising and destroying the world.<br /> Riordan creates the third book of the Heroes of Olympus with stunning suspense and funny moments as always. As found out in the previous books of the series, the team of seven will consist of Jason, Percy, Annabeth, Piper, Hazel, Leo, and Frank. So, Annabeth and the group set off for Camp Jupiter on the Argo II. When they arrive, they encounter much ruckus with the Romans. The Romans and Greeks have been long time enemies. Also through this ruckus, Annabeth is reunited with her boyfriend Percy! The leader of Camp Jupiter, Reyna, refuses to let the Greeks and Romans work and go off on this mission. However, the seven see otherwise. In the middle of this turmoil, Leo makes things worse by firing at the camp from the Argo II. Luckily, the seven escape and head on their quest. On their journey they encounter monsters, gods, and most feared of all... Gaia.  Hazel and Leo on this journey discover the dark secret that connects them. Leo's great grandfather was the lover of Hazel in her former life! Obviously Frank is not enthralled in this at all. Hazel and Leo encounter the goddess Nemesis who warns Leo that, \\"Soon [he] will face a problem [he] cannot solve, though [she] can [him]...for a price.\\" As the journeygoes on, Jason and Piper fight with Hercules to allow them to pass and go to Rome as the destined spot for Gaia to rise. They go to fight the twin giants told in the prophecy and find Nico who has been captured by them. However, Annabeth will not be joining them to fight the twin giants as suspected for their quest. For the first time, she will make a solo quest and find the Mark of Athena. Athena gave her a coin and told her, \\"Follow the Mark of Athena. Avenge me.\\" Annabeth embarks on her own journey to get what her mother wants and possibly be the only Athenian child to do so. When the seven arrive in Rome they split up and Annabeth walks alone. She makes her way into finding the mark. Percy, Jason, and Piper fall into the trap that Piper had seen in her dreams. In the end they recapture Nico and Jason and Percy battle the giants. They slay the giants, get reunited with the rest of the group minus Annabeth, and go searching for her. They find her, but due to consequences the team loses Percy and Annabeth. Can the team go on without them? Can they get to the House of Hades? Are Percy and Annabeth still alive? Will the seven close the Doors of Death?<br /> Mark of Athena is filled with suspense. As any reader of Rick Riordan knows that he is the man at making suspense. Every chapter leaves you hanging and you can't stop reading. The end makes you wish you had the fourth book already. The suspense in this book is not the kind of suspense found in a horror or mystery book, but the suspense that makes you wonder what is going to happen. Not only is the book filled with suspense, but great characters. The book is narrated by Annabeth, Piper, Leo, and Percy. Their different viewpoints give you a different feeling about the book. This book gets more in depth about Annabeth and her complex self. Percy just keeps getting better and Leo is more explained in this book. Riordan did an amazing job at using four viewpoints to tell a story. Thumbs up to Riordan!<br /> The book is an amazing continuation of the Percy Jackson series. These two series are really alike. This book would not be the same without the two great characters of Annabeth and Percy. Throughout this book there are so many references to the former series and many aspects of mythology. There is not another book other than the Percy Jackson series like this book.<br /> This book is highly recommended for any Riordan fan and those who love reading lots of suspense, action, and mythology. Give this book to any Percy Jackson fan and they will enjoy it. They will love this book because Annabeth shines, but Percy is reunited with her. Riordan fans will enjoy it because Riordan's writing just keeps on getting better and of course Percy has the spot light. Fans of tons of action in books will enjoy all the thrilling action in this book because there are no slow parts. However, it recommended for those who have not read the Percy Jackson series to read that first. They will get so confused with all the references made in this book. For those who read the Percy Jackson series, but not the Lost Hero should read the Lost Hero first. Lost Hero is the first book of the Heroes of Olympus series and this is the third book. If as a reader you don't like mythology, then don't read the book. You will have no interest in it.<br /> Overall the book was outstanding. The action was crazy and the suspense was great. Spoiler Alert: the book is in third person. Read it and you will love it! The next book of the series comes out the fall of this year.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Ok improvement boring book seriously don't believe me? READ IT... that is if you want to go ahead unless you want your brain to hurt
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|Game was good, had fun story. The puzzles were pretty easy and fun also. You do have to purchase the 2nd part of the game but wasn't expensive. Will check out more of their games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|a guy that runs on a street. and jumps over cars. and you<br />can get powers. it gots a lot. of characters.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Not a great movie. Not something I would highly recommend. Best not to go to theaters to see movies nowadays as too expensive to see poor quality.
B00913DPW2|4.0|I found this game very challenging and hard.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes to hunt, figure out puzzles and find hidden objects.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Me and my fiance compete to see who can finish levels faster. Its a fun game. I would recommend it to anyone who likes puzzles.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Fair. Not as good as the first two books.  I would recommend it to finish the series .  Was fairly interesting.
0385737955|3.0|i truly wanted to like this novel. i read it in about a day. you would think i liked it because of how quickly i went through it, but unfortunately that's not the case. as other reviewers have mentioned, so much is unknown throughout most of the book- and i just wanted to find out what the heck was going on!<br /><br />i didn't like the made-up words - i had a problem with that when i read the uglies too. it's just unnecessary. character development wasn't there. i really didn't care about anyone. i'm going to read the second book - but it'll be from the library- not worth a purchase.
B006VAEEHI|5.0|We love this book in my house.  I teach 6th grade and I have a 4th grader.  The story itself is well written and one cannot help but love Hugo and really hope he has something go his way.  Also the illustrations are works of art.  What is not to love about this book?
B0007G89G4|5.0|best movie there is its my personal favorite and i beleive that everyopne should watch it and im just a huge fan so i got the delux version
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved all three movies! BR quality is definitely better than regular and for the price this was a steal! Should have cost at least $40!
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was great!  I loved reading it.  It was hard to put down.  Can't wait to read the third book.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This game was exactly what my child wanted for Christmas and the stores were sold out of it so I came on amazon  and purchased it for more than I cared to pay but it was Christmas and it was one of my kids top 3 gifts he wanted.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am one who has been told that I need to participate in life,just as Charlie is told in this book. I would recommend this story to anyone who has struggles with anything.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Absolutely one of the best games out on the Kindle, for lovers of games like League of Legends and Dota. Very easy to play, only lags a bit during PvP on the Kindle Fire. Overall, very impressive. Add my on Gameloft Live. Username is tleiby.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|love the visuals and scenery but I thought this was a free game but its really a demo!  may buy it anyway Cu's it is a good game
B005URRCUY|5.0|my son enjoys this very much. not my kind of thing, but he likes it. sound is great. buy it.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The characters are fantastic. The story is great and it is so difficult to wait from one episode to the next.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|...and I thought Seasons 1 and 2 were action-packed and suspenseful. Season 3, (the first half), had unpredictable plot twists and and a finale that left me screaming for more. The Walking Dead is one of the best series I've seen in my lifetime, and I'm 55!
B0081X8AE6|5.0|I love this album. It's very easy to listen to, with a depth that enables repeated listenings without becoming boring.
B0006J28BO|5.0|My college-aged son recommended this video. He was delighted that I bought it for him for Christmas. We watched it together as a family and we all loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Does what is expected for a simple circulator.  Big numbers, easy to see and use.  Great app.  No need for another one for me
B009186JYI|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas. We had seen the documentary on TV once and he loved it. He also loved the gift.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Not sure I would purchase again, but it wasn't bad for the price. Decent graphics and story line. A lot of going back and forth between scenes.
B007SGM084|4.0|The entire storyline was a page turner; I personally didn't care for the ending. Have read all three books twice and skipped over that word I refuse to repeat which read smoother. Happy reading.
0316044695|5.0|Excellent,what a hero,kids should read this to understand what patriotism really is. Shows the good, the bad, and the ugly of war. Cried allot.
B002W5GPVE|5.0|I think the book is very useful for readers who love reading case studies research.<br /><br />the decision to rate with 5 stars the book  is due to the book is very easy to follow and implement practical examples.<br /><br />As mentioned before, I like the type of exposed cases. The book have full social orientation, I do not like this. Authors should add in new editions, issues related to the application of case study research metodology in technical sciences.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to students of PhD, to reviewers and to readers in general about case studies.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It is perfect. The best part is that you get everything the description says with ZERO advertisements. Great for the pet owner and the business person alike. 5 stars.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|When I saw this on the Amazon website, I didn't give it another look. Then I was browsing another site and saw a picture of this exact cover and realized just how nice it looked. Because I had an Amazon gift card, I ordered it from Amazon. It has not disappointed.<br />One feature I like is that if I'm on a slick surface (hard table, desk) I can &#34;prop&#34; it open in the landscape mode because the edges have a &#34;grippy&#34; surface. I also love the &#34;pocket&#34; for using as a hand hold - the only reason I really wanted a cover in the first place.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought this for my fiancé for Christmas and it was a huge hit for the whole family! There are 3 more discs with extras on them that he almost cried about!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and I think his best one yet. I had trouble putting this book down and finished it faster than his other books. I have read all the Mitch Rapp stories and this had a great story line and can't wait for the next book.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|This young man has so much faith and courage.  The tale is timeless and should inspire all who read it to follow their hearts and dreams.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|i love this book so much. it was so touching the wa Percy and Annabeth(Percabeth) were reunited. now i am just wondering if people are gonna start a Pason(Piper and Jason) vs Percabeth(look at above lines. it would be really childish if they did though. : 
B00A6PD8RQ|3.0|I watched this movie because my son enjoyed it. I thought the storyline would have been more about saving her clan, village, etc other the relationship between her and her mother. That being said the movie itself was entertaining but not a major hit.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|There resides in all of us a bit of fantasy. This show brings it out. It evokes a kind of anticipatory excitement. I looked forward to each episode, and this is something I haven't done in years. It works its own magic on you, and, once hooked, it's difficult NOT to watch. I hope my fascination continues, but, that will be up to the show's writers.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love this show and it was an awesome present for my boyfriend he also loves this show! Thank you
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I enjoy playing this game on my kindle it was the first game I downloaded. I would download it again and again if I could its very addictive and easy to play.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such an emotional roller coaster. One of the best books I have ever read! I really connected with the narrator!
B007R21JJK|5.0|Extremely worthwhile purchase and very much worth the price.  The only issue that I have with it, although it's one that doesn't rate a star being taken away, is that it doesn't support ram above 1600.  I mistakenly purchased 2133, as I plan on using this board for gaming.  However, due to the fact that it would not be compatable, I had to return and buy 1600 RAM.  My fault on not reading as thoroughly as I should, but it's still a very much worthwhile motherboard.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|it's like watching a game i love resident evil but it hard to watch this movie.  Maybe if i seen it in 3D it would be better but I don't so.
B004S49YEM|4.0|I found it interesting as I was a child at the time, remember people talking about not talking, so those years come to life for me.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|LOVED This book can't wait till May when the next one comes out. Think I may have to go and pre order it now!
B004I1WIWU|5.0|This woman's voice really touches your soul. Her writing stays with you long after the record stops playing. Buy it and you'll play it often.<br /><br />Sound recording quality is top notch. Vinyl version is quiet as a mouse. Very pleased to make this purchase and recommend it all of my audiophile and music loving friends.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!! I can't wait to read the other three books and for more movies!!!!!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|After watching season one we were excited about starting season 2. After the first couple of episode I was dissipointed, not as good as the first. Decicided to give it a chance we are glad we did, as the story line got more interesting.  We did a marathon watch over the weekend and by the 5th episode  were hooked couldnt wait for the next, now that were cought up, it sucks we have to wait till next week.for episoe 11 Worth waching
B007SGM084|5.0|Great read.<br />Recommended to read over and over again. Hopefully the author will have Christian's version out next. Thanks for a great love story.
B001QOOCTE|2.0|Maybe I'm getting too old for this kind of music. I liked what I heard online, but the CD was just boring to me. Some might think it fine though.
B008VBYN80|4.0|It is a fun little pass the time game. I dont like the pay for more gem stuff but if it becomes more fun i will buy the gems the
B009IAN56E|4.0|It was a gift for my daughter who loved it. It  seems we have a new British invasion! Not as good as the Beatles though
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Enjoyed every moment!  Definite page turner, couldn't put it down.  I loved the romance, the history (at least the fictional history), and all the characters.
B009B4ZEMA|3.0|What can you say about Christina? She has a strong voice although sometimes her lyrics are a bit off. Chose the G rated version as it was a gift for my 13 yr old
B009UX2YAC|5.0|a fun game for the whole family. bold colors and fast pace. we see who can collect the most coins.
B008CP93S0|2.0|The movie was funny and I liked it, but about middle ways it started acting up.  It took a long time to get to the end.  It would stop  and start...a lot
B004DM0UII|1.0|1) malicious intent because a sticky broadcast will blow by any other security and be global to the entire system. So they can easily be used for very nefarious reasons. 2) lazy programming. 3) some valid reason for some system level application that you truly truly trust that actually would need such access (I cannot think of a single example of a user level application that would need this level of access).<br /><br />Unexplained sticky intents in a radio app are EXTREMELY suspicious. They are global and they stick around forever. They also blow past all other permissions and security since they are intended to be used at the SYSTEM level only. No radio app ever needs that level of access! Ever ever ever! Sorry, but no way in heck will I install this and I will definitely warn people about it. I did \\"buy it\\" as the free app of the day but when I noticed the permissions I did not actually install it and I will not as long as they have these ridiculous permissions embedded in it. Shame on this developer for trying to pull a fast one (or so it seems).<br /><br />In fact, here is a direct quote from a developer of Android itself: \\" Er... there is NO reason to use sticky broadcasts for communication within your own app. In fact, I'll go farther and say you just should not do this. Sticky broadcasts are GLOBAL to the system. And because of this, performing a sticky broadcast is multiple orders of magnitude slower than just implementing direct calls within your own app (IPC for each receiver to register, IPC to the system to send it, IPC from the system back to your app to deliver it, marshalling and unmarshalling of all the data within the Intent over both IPCs).<br /><br />More than that, there is NO protection on them, so any other application can watch your sticky broadcasts, or even send their own values back to you. (Btw, this is also issue with using any broadcasts within your own app. Broadcasts are really there for cross-application communication. It is just far more efficient and easier to implement these things within an app by having a callback interface.)<br /><br />Now I am really regretting that I made that function public. :/<br /><br />> And of course, if you want out of application notifications, you have > no other option.<br /><br />You do have the option of using a normal broadcast rather than a sticky broadcast. You'll notice that there are basically no sticky broadcasts used by the system, at least that you see in the public APIs. In fact there are some places they are used internally, but even those are slowly going away as we discover security holes with them because there is no way to protect who can receive the broadcast data.\\"<br /><br />If you Google a block of this post you will find the original source Amazon will not allow me to post a link to it. (Update you can find the link to this in Daniel's comment, below! Turns out that links seem to be okay in replies, just not in reviews? At least it wouldn't allow me to do it.

B002VPE1WK|1.0|The first time that I packed my T4i and lenses in the bag and picked it up by the top strap it came apart. I would have thought that there would be better quality assurance since Amazon has attached their name to this product.<br /><br />The interior of the bag is well designed and am hoping I received a defective bag. I have requested a replacement but can not recommend this back at this time to carry valuable photographic material.
0425263916|5.0|I just loved this book.  It is all and more for anyone to love and to read.  I will read it again.
1594481717|4.0|FWIW, I'm a right-brainer.  For the most part, it's served me well through several career changes in environments from small startups to mega-corporations.  I've always managed to find some way to satisfy my creative impulses and &#34;big picture&#34; view  and leverage them to accomplish real work in different and often highly effective/efficient (and *always* more entertaining) ways.  As Mr. Pink notes, the universe needs BOTH types of minds.  Though, the business world often succumbs to exasperation when encountering those of us on the far right end of the right-brain scale.  (I can't say I don't understand left-brainers' occasional disinclination to suffer my own fits of artistic mania -- I drive *myself* nuts once in a while.)  In any case, I agree with the author that the further the developed world moves away from more analytical &#34;L-directed thinking&#34; toward high concept/high touch &#34;R-directed thinking,&#34; the more likely an increase in demand for right-brainers.
0345803493|5.0|I just can't say enough about all these books which I have enjoyed very very much.  Before I never picked up a book to read untill I read the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  The 3 books were just the best.  I have learned alt from these books.  And know what I am missing in my life.  Thank You alot.
B000HF0KXU|5.0|If you haven't seen this...SEE IT!  An exceptional movie that you cannot figure out until the end...and then?  Lots of fun, John Travolta is excellent as usual, Hugh Jackman  is fabulous, and Halle Berry is great.  Exceptional entertainment, I highly recommend.  Not for the faint of heart.
0425263908|5.0|I just loved this one too.  I have learned alot and just enjoyed reading it.  It only took 2 days to read it.  I loved it alot.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|My opinion, the best Batman of all the Batman movies.  Why???  Heath Ledger, he totally steals the movie, the best Joker (apologies to Jack) ever.  The movie is well done, a little to sappy with the Gyllenhaal girl, but like I said the movie is worth everything because of Heath Ledger.  Sorry he passed away.
0345803507|5.0|These 3 books were out of this world.  I loved these three the best.  I have recomend them to my friends.  Like I said before &#34;These were the best&#34; E L James you are the best in my book.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I cannot say enough about this movie, it was filmed in my city of Detroit (which I am proud), and the story is so sad yet kind with a smattering of humor.  Please give this movie a chance, it is so great.  So many people do not know of the Hmong people, but we have quite a large settlement in the Detroit area.  Clint Eastwood does not disappoint, as usual.  His acting is perfect and his direction is flawless.  A truly a 10 Star movie!
B0087OXDDC|5.0|I recommend this book , because it makes that you understand Phrasal Verbs in a practical way and you can remember them in your daily life, Also the author is smart when he find a relation between the preposition or particle and the phrasal verb .<br />Enjoy this e-book
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the books and was glued to it every day until I finished them. Nice to buy all 3 together.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|it's good and I am happy with what I got. this thing is annoying and I am adding words now
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this trilogy!! I have read it many times and loved it just as much as the first time.
B001AQR39O|5.0|Hank Moody for president! My literary skills and vocabulary are nowhere good enough to review how excellent this series is; especially if Hank proofreads it. Once one graduates from entourage they'll end up here.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Loved every second of this book! It was suspenseful and keeps you wanting more. The detail in her writing allows you to get completely lost in story. A must read if you have read The Hunger Games!
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I really really like this book. I would recommend this to people who like sad stories. I will read the rest of the series:)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I give this book fives stars! I dove in head first after reading the other two books in this trilogy, and found myself lost in the country of Panem once again. There are twists and turns that you never see coming. The love story as always keeps you wholeheartedly involved. A must read for anyone who has invested in The Hunger Games trilogy!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|A wonderful addition to the series. I couldn't write a better third book in the series myself. Great job Rick.
B008FOB124|4.0|Been a DCD fan since Beyond the Realm of the Dying Sun album and have seen them many times live. This new record is excellent. Outstanding songs are Lisa's- Anabasis, Agape and Kiko. Brendan's Amnesia and Opium. Dark, layered instruments, well written and produced. Vintage Dead Can Dance. You won't be disappointed!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Using this search board is easy to use and will always be my search engine of choice when looking up items..

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Riveting, scandalous, and a masterpiece,, John Grisham has delivered again. Very captivating and a must read. Excellent. Highly recommended. Great
B000FBJAOG|5.0|I've always been fascinated by believable fiction. Max Brooks brings to the table information that is so near authentic, I almost went out to begin filling a survival shopping list. The accounts, information and suggestions in this work are<br /> so believable, you'll be jumping at sounds in the night! Bravo!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I rated this book because I love Rick Riordan`s books.  I would recommend to this book to anyone who likes fantasy adventure or mythology but even if you won`t think you like it you must tread it.  You should also read his other books.
B005HSL626|5.0|I had got this then went to buy the full version but it would have been a waste because the free version has more content then full version.
B009MO57H6|3.0|Good god paul anderson, i am a long fan of resident evil and your lovely wife Milla but this film kinda sucked. It did take alot from the game some but some of the action scenes were cheesy, and i could tell some makeup on zombies was poor. The story line seems all messed up as well and was confusing from the start, milla falls in water wakes up in umbrella.....fights and kills the main guy from last movie but yet at ends fights on his side and now given the t-virus again?? I can see that this is leading up to going back to the hive to fight the &#34;changed appearance&#34; the &#34;red queen&#34;. Why could you not leave some things as they are. kudos on milla still pulling off her hotness but in the last film please paul get help!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time, if ever. Couldnt put it down, very intriguing and complex plot.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My husband & I both adore Downtown Abbey. The people are portrayed as real people with difference beliefs and most are good and it is injoyable because most are working hard to do the right thing. The Crawley family are smart and humane and care for everyone. The costumes and settings look real down to the last detail. It's a joy to watch. All seasons.
1935670913|5.0|This book has some very good advice.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain that Mr. Locke uses some unconventional marketing methods, such as \\"purchased reviews.\\"  Obviously, these reviewers have never operated their own businesses.  Do they live in America?  Have they even visited America, or do they live is a cave somewhere?  Well, of course they probably live here, but they are incredibly naive or they are completely sold out to the culture of BIG business.<br /><br />Look at CBS Sunday Morning.  Look at The Today Show.  Look at the New York Times, itself.  These are all full of powder puff news pieces that are written or managed or spun by advertising agencies, which are themselves marketed as public relations agencies, lobbying agencies, or journalists.  Their purpose is to generate \\"purchased reviews\\" for products, personalities, events, and political positions.  So it's okay if the BIG Boys do it, but it is almost a crime if the little guy does it.  Especially if he succeeds.<br /><br />The fact is that in this country, you have to do something to get your name out and to build a brand. You have to market your product.  No matter how good you are, no one will buy your product if you don't market in unconventional ways.  Cooke is honest and forthright in saying this. He has succeeded with his marketing techniques.  As he says, his product is not Bill Shakespeare, but it is not intended to be.  It is intended to satisfy his customer base with a product they want and will buy.  He markets.  Great.  He sells.  Well, no matter how well you market, you cannot sell if you have a crappy product that no one wants.  Someone wants his product.  Lots of people do, in fact.  (He sells a lot more books than I do, that is for sure.)<br /><br />The converse is not true.  If you have a great product and you do not market (in the American way, which is not always the way that those who could not sell umbrella in the rain and have never tried, are always complaining about)you willnever succeed.<br /><br />You have to have a half way decent product, and you have to market it.  Locke is dead right about that.<br /><br />John Roy Brown
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|My husband was thrilled with his gift! He spent the whole day watching movies and the extra's. This was his best gift of the year.<br /><br />The quality is great. The price was great!<br /><br />Thanks Amazon you delivered yet again!

The last good albums from legends like Michael Jackson,Genesis, Dire Straits, and Bob Seger just as a new wave of music was coming: Nirvana,Pearl Jam,Soundgarden  and resurgent veteran acts like U2, Metallica, R.E.M, Red Hot Chili Peppers were reaching new heights. Dire Straits holds a special place as the biggest musical act on the planet for a short period after Queen and the Police and before U2 would take over.This is the end of Straits with a solid entry into their Discography.

B00AQF8CJ0|2.0|Bought this game yesterday it could be fun.  HOWEVER  when it gets to Mushroom Power, it goes crazy and WILL not stop processing.  Have to shut it down to go on.  Can not get but so far and the processing starts all over again.  I did delete it and downloaded it again and then synced it.  ANY Suggestions?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I honestly wasn't sure what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised.  What an interesting book and story.  Doing it from the perspective of the dog is very cleaver.

0307592731|1.0|Cheryl Strayed/Starved or whatever name she chooses to use this week sets off on a hiking adventure of hundreds of miles - without ever packing her backpack to see if everything will fit! Without a hiking staff! In hiking boots that are too small! And it doesn't get any better as she walks. She continues to make immature, impulsive decisions from California to Oregon. I guess the reader is supposed to be impressed and amazed at her growth and insights. I was more annoyed at her stupidity than anything else. Her lack of planning and and foresight lead her into one crisis  after another, and I found myself rooting for the PCT vs. Cheryl.

B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I knew going in that it was juvenile but I did not think it would be so over the top silly.
B000FBJAOG|3.0|Very flat and unspirited writing but interesting still for zombie genre fans.  Not an action or thriller of a read.  More like reading a dictionary.

B005LAIIQC|5.0|I like this movie.  I wasn't sure I was going to since I really liked the Matt Damon Bourne character but I gave it a chance.  The movie ends a bit too soon so I think it means there will be another one coming to finish the story.  I hope so anyway.

B007L3BMGA|3.0|I can't see what all the hoopla is about this book, plus also the two sequels. There is nothing more raunchy or explicit in this book compared to many other books available for a cheaper price.<br /><br />I do feel somewhat conned into purchasing this book and would strongly recommend that people look at other titles before committing to purchase this one.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I knew next to nothing about the plot of this film besides it being about a headstrong girl that with a mop of red hair. I was pleasantly surprised by the touching story. While I found myself identifying with the girl, my wife felt the girl was more to blame instead of the mom like I concluded. Regardless, the movie was funny, charming, very colorful and vibrant and nicely animated. I would have given it 5 stars but my wife insisted on 4 because the two songs that were sung, the artists had no accent while singing and she felt it did not match the thick accents of the cast very well. Overall, as an adult, I felt this was a very good movie that was fun and entertaining that also had a point to make while not being heavy handed.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|If you like thrillers - you'll like this.  Very exciting until the end.  No let downs and no wasted words.
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|Wow!  Some of these old songs, really took me back to a unique time in the history of disco sound and dance.  Highly recommend!

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|Keeps the story flowing, great narrative style. Characters you can identify with.<br /><br />Highly recommended. Read the series, you won't be disappointed.
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Rashomon.  It is a film based on three short stories by Ryunosuke Akutagawa and directed by Akira Kurosawa.  It was one of the only films he directed for Daiei, and it is arguable the film that catapulted Kurosawa to fame (definitely the film that brought international attention to his talent).  The film was the Grand Prix selection of the Venice International Film Festival and won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film.  Though Seven Samurai is often regarded as his masterpiece (and often regarded as one of - if not THE - greatest film of all time), Rashomon was a success that endures to this day and without that success, Kurosawa's later films may not have ever been realized.<br /><br />Rashomon is interesting because of the broken narrative.  The film is about a rape and murder in the forest and four different accounts of the events of the crime to a tribunal.  The initial scenes are set at a 'Rashomon' gate.  The three characters are a priest, a woodcutter, and a commoner.  The priest and woodcutter recount their recollections to the commoner.  Interestingly, all four accounts might be false.  Kurosawa even stated (in his autobiography - the excerpt is included with this version of the film) that the film is a metaphor for the human spirit.  Regardless of the symbolism, the film is an icon of classic Japanese cinema.<br /><br />About this version.  I have seen the previous Criterion version, and it is very good.  But Kadokawa headed and funded a major restoration of the film in 2008 for re-release in Japan.  Criterion gained the rights to distribute this version in the states.  And I must say that I was blown away by the restoration.  The Blu-Ray is phenomenal.  The viewer can see each stray hair on characters' heads.  Other amazing scenes are the gorgeous forest backdrops, the close ups of the characters under the gate, and one particularly amazing and beautiful scene where the woman is running her hand through a stream.  It's all so clear that I am amazed it was released in 1950.<br /><br />The sound is amazing, but there are a few scenes where the audio track is off so very slightly from the spoken dialogue.  I assume these scenes had to be re-recorded in studio due to ambient sounds (they were all scenes from the gate set).  The music is at its eerie best.<br /><br />Extras are plentiful.  There are several options on the Blu-Ray itself.  There is an interview with Takashi Shimura, though I found this disappointing, sadly.  Another extra on disc is a 60 odd minute documentary with several members of the original crew.  But the best extra is the audio commentary by Donald Richie, which is included on previous versions.  The booklet is nearly identical to the previous Criterion booklet: it includes an excerpt from 'Something Like an Autobiography' as well as the short stories 'Rashomon' and 'The Grove' by Akutagawa.<br /><br />So really, the only true bonuses for this edition over the previous edition are the restoration, the additional Shimura interview, and the mini documentary.  If you are thinking of upgrading to the Blu-Ray then this is a worthy purchase.  If you own the previous DVD version and are thinking of just getting the newer version on DVD, then there really isn't much more you can expect.  If you don't own a previous copy, then either version is worthy.  But the Blu-Ray is the way to appreciate the new restoration.  It's a film that is timeless, and I applaud Kadokawa for spending the time and money on this masterful restoration for the 21st century.<br /><br />Verdict: buy the Blu-Ray regardless of if you own a previous copy, then sell or give away the previous copy.l so clear that I am amazed it was released in 1950.<br /><br />The sound is amazing, but there are a few scenes where the audio track is off so very slightly from the spoken dialogue.

B007EECSFA|5.0|I was so happy to see that Kate Morton had a new book out! And it was impossible to stop reading! Excellent plot and LOVED the characters. You will never see the end coming! Just fabulous! Please Kate, don't make us wait too long for the next one!!!
B002ZG976U|5.0|Wonderful story, wonderful music, wonderful acting, and wonderful dancing.  I loved the humor, I loved everything about it.  I've watched it about 20 times, and even have the music CD.  5 stars are not enough!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Awesome Movie!!!<br />The Best Movie of the Year! Hands Down the best! Great Fun! Great writing, great character development, and great acting.
1572816112|5.0|Definitely not your ordinary run of the mill art. This intriging deck is beautiful and dark with a touch of bizarre. Each card is like an art piece by itself.  The card stock is good and sturdy and the cards were particularly accurate.  Great deck to add to your collection.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have a samsung galaxy s2 with a lot of apps.  I like to use the GPS and typically keep the bluetooth, wifi and 4G turned on. My battery does not last long and this is great for repeated chargings.  Took it to Universal Studios and had power all day with plenty to spare in the backup. If you want something for your jeans pockets, get the smaller unit.  This will be ok in cargo pockets on shorts/pants, but too big with the phone for other pockets.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Sturdy cable, unlike some other companies with 3 times as expensive cables, I feel like this won't fray easily. I'm able to transfer documents to my fire with this which is not true of every Micro-USB cable as some seem to be too thin, to be able to engage that functionality.
0345803493|5.0|This trilogy is unbelieveable....really entertaining.  When she says it's dark, she really means DARK.  It's sick and twisted and I loved every minute of it!  Great writing, totally engrossing and VERY dark.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Basic concept of the game;<br />  1. Pick a type of infection (Bacteria is your only starting option).<br />  2. Pick a country to start in. Factors like cleanliness, access to drugs, rural versus urban, population, sea and airports all factor into how quickly and well it will spread from here.<br />  3. Acquire &#34;DNA points&#34; over time as more people are infected by your disease.<br />  4. Mutate your disease to make it spread more rapidly and give it more side effects.<br />  5. Try to keep your disease ahead of the world trying to fend it off through a variety of means.<br /><br />You DO NOT have to do in app purchases to get a lot of enjoyment out this.  Personally I appreciate the challenge and the &#34;grind&#34; of doing it the hard way. The 99 cents I paid for this so far has been well worth it.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I mean, it's a Blu Ray Movie. Shipping was fast, as it was from amazon. Movie was a great watch, and the quality was awesome as well. Cheapest price for the this product is here, as far as I know. Recommended.

B008RYN44U|2.0|This CD is a bit overdone.  I do love No Doubt, but prefer their earlier stuff when it was less about being a diva and more about making some good music.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Loved this movie so much we bought it and have watched it five times and enjoyed it more and more each time!
B008J34466|5.0|If you are pink fan, this will not dissapoint.  Granted I hate the new P!nk as her name for this as it makes it a nuisance for searching for it in my Itunes, but what ever.. Still a fine cd and I think it may be her best one yet.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a book that started out great and ended the same. Like how we got to see Connor grow and realize what love is before it was to late. Makes people realize that money isn't everything in life and to come to reality of the real importance of love and family.
B0088TG252|5.0|You were in the Green Latern.  This is a good comeback.  You did much better in this film.  Lol.  Acting was much better.  Ha ha.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|Not much to say, its just horrible. My son and I made up the dialogue for the last 30 mins of the movie to make it enjoyable. We found that &#34;Mortal Kombat&#34; work great for the ending fight scene.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is a lot like bejeweled 3!  Great graphics and game play!<br />If you love bejeweled you'll love this game. One of the best gem games out there :)
B009KHCT94|2.0|The idea of this movie is very intriguing, and there are some scenes that feel very original, but overall it just does not deliver.... unless you think of it as a comedy... then it makes watching this movie palpable.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|First of all: to trevordog the key is in a book.  This was a great and entertaining HO + Puzzle game that captures your attention and makes you not what to STOP!!!!  I really enjoyed this game and can't wait for a sequel!
B009NQKXYK|1.0|I feel like the mythical god Prometheus having my liver ripped from my body, blood spilling out onto the ground beneith me. Over and over I endure he pain and ask for it to stop, but it does not. This is how I feel every time I think of this movie. I felt as if I was watching a VERY beautiful national geographic documentary on human evolution, DNA, etc and in the end a shinny tooth dino-pet erupts from the belly of the beast. I was neither scared or intrigued during this movie. The tone of this movie is dark and also visually &#34;dark&#34;, but it is not scary and it is not action paced. Imagine being in a classroom with the dull drone of the teacher as he relates and described &#34;xeno-biology&#34; every once in a while he throws a couple of rubber snakes at you just to see if you are still paying attention. I have not added my upset with regard to relation to the &#34;alien&#34; universe as even without this, the movie by itself lacks everything a good movie should have in it.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|first time playing a game like this. very challenging . I like the graphics. I had to use the help and hint button on occasion.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|Very lame, was completely disappointed. No actual substance, just a movie of cameos. Thought it would at least be decent like the first one or A-Team...rent something else!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Two characters that you both love and hate at the same time.  I especially like that the book alternates between two points of view.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like the challenges and the graphics are great.  I play temple run as well. It's an ok game the only thing I don't like is I have to tilt my kindle to get my player to move side to side. Unlike subway surfer just a swipe of your finger and you move left or right.
B0087X728K|5.0|Best thermal paste to use in my opinion, period.  Have use this product always for 10 years, never disappointed. Use only the best.

B009Y4E414|5.0|Eva Cassidy was a D.C. Area success story. She grew up in Oxen Hill and Bowie, Maryland.  Having grown up in the Riverdale/College Park, MD area myslef makes me especially sorry that I only discovered her recently.  Her candle burned brightly but for only a few years.  Cancer took her and she passed in November of 1996.  She could work with artists of many assorted styles (Chuck Brown of D.C. area fame was just one) - She's not a sham to sell music - There's real talent there and I would recommend her CD wholeheartedly - ONly the  good die young !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  RIP

B009VYF5E2|5.0|I should mention I have only seen the first four seasons of this show (apparently the fifth and final season just finished airing) and that is what I'll refer to. Most all \\"spoilers\\" aren't really spoilers considering the age of the Arthurian myth but I'll try to keep spoilers to a minimum anyway.<br /><br />I'm going to start this review with a synopsis of something completely unrelated: a Disney version movie about the Alamo featuring Davy Crockett, Sam Huston and a number of such cowboys that some might say have now passed into legend was released almost ten years ago. I watched it on one of the movie channels and I just remember being so disappointed with it on so many levels. Where I was expecting and hoping for something with more the fun tone of \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" I got more of historical almost documentary that seemed to go out it's way to delusional me with with facts and realities about the different characters around the events of \\"The Alamo\\". In short, just wasn't that fun to watch and was a very forgettable movie.<br /><br />I mention that because this show takes a legend/myth, perhaps not exactly the same level of myth/legend, and does it right. In fact this show is the reason I enjoy British shows so much more than American stuff.<br /><br />The thing is I don't know why I like it so much. The production values are extremely low. The effects are hokey. I have no kids and I'm in my mid-30s. I really have no excuse for watching and/or enjoying this show. And yet there's something about it I just have to keep watching it. And when I say the production values are low I mean they're really low. As in the prop shields actually LOOK cardboard. They don't even reflect light as if they're some sort of metal. Same for the swords. It's almost as if the production values are low on purpose like the early seasons of South Park.<br /><br />And maybe you could say the writing makes up for this. Well some episodes are actually pretty good and at thesame time have rather gaping plot holes. The palace guards may as well not exist they're so easily over-come or knocked out.<br /><br />I think what sets this show apart is that it although if you just watched a short clip of it you could tempted to dismiss it as a kid's show at the same time there's a lot of serious issues that are tackled and a lot of grey areas explored. And what really sets it apart from any American kid's production is death. Characters, some times major characters, actually die. There's never any actual blood (it's not game of thrones after all) but people do die. In fact the first episode of the series features several magic practitioners being burned at the stake. Not shown in any detail of course, just people tied up and fires being started, towns people looking away.<br /><br />So it's not a realistic show depicting life of the dark ages or realistic combat (what combat there is always shown in exaggerated slow motion) or what you'd really have to do to survive in the wilderness. In that way it may as well be an animated show. And yet it's not so sanitized as to never ever cope with death, loss, betrayal, or tough decisions.<br /><br />I thought they actually did a good job with the character arcs. Arthur and Morgana for instance: In that first season I would not have thought it possible Morgana would turn into this evil villain she eventually becomes. And Merlin gains more and more ability so gradually I hardly noticed it happening. I wasn't expecting Merlin's elderly alter-ego to become a regular thing either. By the end of the forth season it was just seemed like it fit perfectly. Some famously named knights, Lancelot for instance, make appearances early on but leave upon realizing Camelot isn't ready for them. In one episode they even find a long abandoned castle with round table in it. And over several episodes in different seasons Merlin manages to work in the sword in the stone part of the legend.<br /><br />There's also some solidvalues included through out about doing the right thing, taking responsibility your own actions, forgiving when necessary...everything you would expect the King Arthur of legend to represent in other words. Let me emphasize it is not in any way preachy. These are about as universally accepted values as you can find.<br /><br />In summary this exactly what I would hope and want a TV production about the Arthurian myth would be: a group of noble knights, lead by King Arthur, fighting for their kingdom and holding up what's truly right against all evil. Doesn't get bogged down in the logistics of how that army is being supplied or how that army covered that distance all the way to within sight of the main castle without anyone in the kingdom noticing. That's thinking about it too hard. Just enjoy it for it is I guess I'm saying.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I like the game but when I starter playing it wouldn't let me go onto the next level, it kept making me go back to level 1, fix that and it would be a good game.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Tom Clancy's ability to present complex military situations has again come through as he relates a realistic tale of cyberwar, global threat and US response.  His research is superb as he develops a fictional threat which mostly seems to be non-fiction!<br /><br />Great read.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another excellent Michael Connelly book! Harry Bosch never disappoints. I really like how the relationship between Harry and Maddie is developing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|There's a strange thing that happens after playing this game for even a few minutes - though that's easier said than done - my mind feels somehow relaxed and fully engaged. The soundtrack surely has a lot to do with that.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I would have rated this a little higher but part of the story line is rather icky and uncomfortable to read. *Possible spoiler alert* - if reading about incestuous rape makes you uncomfortable then this is not for you. I don't know why anyone would want to read about that - its just icky to say the least. However, I liked the characters and the plot was obviously very well thought out and detailed, but as I said, there was an aspect that I didn't particularly like reading about.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|My kids laughed non-stop on this movie.  It is very similar to Home Alone 1 but still a good rent.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have used Adobe Reader extensively at work and like being able to have the software available at home now.
B00A757EFW|4.0|Good game, wish the control would react better, but then again, what can you do, it is on a touchscreen.  It is true to the original and fun when you need a quick game fix.
B008F5Y7UQ|3.0|A attempt at a sweet romantic comedy, though rather unbelievable and contribute.  Emily Blunt and Ewan McGregor make a good rffort to give the movie substane.  Recommend  it as a pocorn movie to relax an evening away.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|Good game...its free after all, and it is entertaining for a little bit anyway.  Graphics are basic and gameplay is ok.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|for a free game, I really enjoy playing it - sometimes it takes me a number of tries to get three stars.
B009HEJXFS|1.0|Never got to preview the movie! Streaming was<br />what you could say was less then Desirable! POOR QUALITY! If I could have seen movie,  then I could have evaluated it!
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|I enjoyed the actors and their performances within their respective roles. The balance of the various character's intentions is well exectued and creates an excellent sense of tension thoughout the film. However the period music, full of sung lyrics, detracted from the overall setting and the period story within that setting.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Great deal cant go wrong with it!!! Comes with great book and behind the scenes clips!! Great price for blue ray!!
1400067820|2.0|This is the 3rd book of Taleb's that I have read and each seems to get a little worse in terms of giving new ideas, writing style and the author's excessuve opinions.<br /><br />Not many new ideas associated with finance or economics in this book, but lots of new ideas conerning diet, exercise, architecture, medicine, the value of various professions, etc.,.<br /><br />The writing style often changes from chapter to chapter with some chapters extremely difficult to read and others pretty easy.  The conclusion was especially easy to read yet thoughtful.  Don't understand why this writing style could not be used throughout the book.<br /><br />I have never agreed 100% with Taleb's ideas, but found them interesting, learned from them, and liked where they took my own thinking until this book.<br /><br />As this book brought me more new insight to his opinions on diet, exercise, medicine, architecture, and various professions versus economics and finance, this is my last purchase of one of his books.
B007THA4FI|2.0|I found it to be boring. Some parts were okay. The ending was horrible. I feel like I wasted all my time on the disappointing ending. I really feel as if there wasn't an ending.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I loved this game G5 Entertainment has the best games WAY to go G5 Entertainment keep it up :)  Fixing to find another one to play!!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Fifty Shades Freed had the possibility of being a five star book, but the author dragged out every little scene.  We get that they love having sex everywhere and anytime, but OMG, really!  The whole entire book!  I believe had the author focused more on the action part of the book it would have been better.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Family were all here for Christmas. Big Sherock Holmes fans. Have all the original shorts & novels as well as the movies & t.v. versions. Relly enjoyed it.<br /><br />Thanks, Lisa
B004V5A7K8|4.0|I love this game. Even though you have to go back when you run out of balls, it still is fun. I got this game when it was free on the deal of the day. Great game!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love this game it is very good game love the storyteller must be more game like this in the future.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I waste so much time on this app. I love it! I haven't had any problems with it. some options aren't available that you can do on a computer though.  would highly recommend :)
0780619587|5.0|Very dark and different kind of TRUE story, great cast as well, it keeps your interest all the way through.<br />The ending is very uplifting, had a great time watching it, can't wait to see it again!
B001JIFYSA|1.0|This film is flat out determined to rub the old fashioned minded among us raw with its \\"anything goes\\", cameo soaked take on love.  In their desire to point out the fact that love is happening all around us everyday the producers chose to take the low road and indulged in a decidedly relativistic view of morality and ethics.  Scenes run the gambit from thought provoking vinets to the suddenly perverted and bizzarre.  Declaring this 2hr hodge-podge \\"Love Actually\\" is akin to declaring a birthing video \\"Parenthood Actually\\".  I think most of us would agree that love goes far deeper than sexual impulses and emotional highs.  After about 1hr of bewilderment we ended up fast forwarding through the key scenes just to find out why everyone gave this little gem 4 stars.  We found nothing which redeemed its $3 rental cost. Save your $3!  Instead, take your special someone our for a coffee and reaffirm your commitment to them, write them some poetry or thank them for being who they are in your life.  Unless your a cameo junkie or enjoy having your sensibilities accosted every half an hour this film is a vacuous waste of your time.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|this is a good dictionary it was so helpful I Will  use it again yes I Will use it again
B008PZ69T8|5.0|It is exactly what I expected and I love it I listen to it every day I just cant stop
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fact and scenery everything you would expect of the BBC, this is real life nature at its best, a real education treat for the family.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Not just a calculator, but a very well thought out and powerful tool to have at your fingertips -- keep your previous results in front of you so you don't have to remember your last step.
B006JD48NM|5.0|Being a fan for as long as I can remember, to watch the greatest driver of all time evolve from a young man to the true champion and then the heartache of his demise, so sad.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This was a replacement cable so I'm giving it 4 stars because I received it the next day.  I like my Kindle and hope this cable stands up in quality better than the previous one.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin is IMO unquestionably THE single greatest rock n roll band of all time, and their talent is showcased well here. From Page's extended solo in White Summer to Bonzo's explosion on drums in Moby Dick this DVD absolutely rocks!! I promise that you will not be dissapointed in the least with this DVD! I bought it about 7 years ago and hadn't listened to it in several years until today. I decided to pull it out and man am I glad I did! I loved it so much it prompted me to get on here and review it. Well over 600 reviews and it still has a 5 star average! I dare you to try to find ANYTHING else with that many reviews that maintains a 5 star average! Watching this you'll come to appreciate just how extraordinary they are individually and even more so as a band. The odds of putting together a band and having each of the 4 members be unquestionably in the top 10 of their respective areas of expertise are astronomical. They are the first and greatest superband of all time! HAMMER OF THE GODS is right!!!!!!!!!!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|It kept my interest so I read it most every day.  The ending did surprise me so it was worth the money spent.
B0087GZ8YW|2.0|The plot as well as the characters of Rebus and Siobhan in Rankin's latest have become less than credible. Rebus should really settle for retirement.
B0091REZMW|3.0|When the rooms go dark you get this little circle that is mostly under your finger to find each object.  If you have any vision issues you probably wont like this app. This is the reason I don't like it. So NOT for the vision impaired.
B004TI5N38|5.0|This was a super story and certainly kept my interest. About two thirds of the way through &#34;The Forgotten&#34; by the same author. Incredible writer.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|It held my attention from the first page to the last. It is the best book I have read in a long long time.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Love John Grisham, however, if felt that this story &#34;kind of missed&#34; in the end.  Can't be 100% all the time.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once again Nicholas Sparks has written a great book. I wanted to make sure that I had read this book before seeing it on the big screen, and I of course wasn't disappointed. Can't wait to start the next one by this great author.
1423140605|5.0|For my 11 year old daughter who has been reading the series.  She said the book was great and it met her expectations.  She loves this author.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A good yarn by one of the best storytellers around. Interesting twist with the main character and the conclusion is excellent
B004O3YGMC|1.0|The app worked fine but after installation on my kindle fire hd no other app would work. Hulu would not work. Netflix would only play sound no video. I had to uninstall splashtop. After i took it off my kindle fire hd was back to working nicely again.
B0064W65SO|5.0|Just a great telling of Barman's origin. Highly recommended to any fan of the Dark Knight or the comic book genre in general.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This item was the hit of the season. I would buy again! Thanks for the great service. Top of the line.
1452110581|4.0|I have known many cats and I'm sure if they could hold pens in their paws they would write  poetry such as this.  I found it honest, hilarious and beguiling.  Perhaps people without intimate friendships with felines will not be so enchanted as I was, but I highly recommend it to anyone who has lived with or does live with cats.
0385344228|5.0|I enjoyed it.  I lived up to my expectations and then some.<br />I am loaning it to my aunt, I'm sure she will enjoy it also.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was a superb game with great graphics and story line.  It was well put together with easy to read dialogues and guidance. Your doing a great job Alawar! I am looking forward to more games from You.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is amazing!!!! So many huge bombs where dropped and it's absolutely awesome! I can not wait to see the movie!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|the first few chapters are a little hard to get into but give it a chance it will suck you in.  Watching the first season helped as well
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|It is pretty cool. The only thing I don't like is that u have to pay to get more diamonds. But other wise it's great.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|Doing things &#34;in the cloud&#34; is very new concept to me.  With it's easy set up this was a great intro to it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the first one more, it was a little slow in the beginning of the second book but quickly got my attention more and more until the very last page! Cannot wait to download the third and final book!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr.Alexander is an amazing man with an amazing experience to share.  A thought provoking book for anyone who has an open mind to post death existence.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is great in it's ease of downloading, simplicity of use, and the price is definitely right since it's free!!! I would certainly suggest it to everyone and anyone who enjoys the game! It's a good way to keep your mind active during those moments when you've got idle time.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|this game is fun a little boring at first but when you  get use to it .it turns out to be a fun game to play.shakira approves!
B007704HO6|5.0|Lovely story.  I found it well balanced between Bob and his owner.  An impelling story of how of one little cat turned a man's life around.  I wish both of them much success.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I saw the movie first and loved it. I decided to read the book when I got my Kindle and oh my gosh was it the right decision. I laughed, I cried (a lot) just in love.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I purchased these over 6 months ago.  My primary use is at my home computer for gaming and listening to music.  I use this headset for voip communication - such as TeamSpeak or Ventrilo.<br /><br />When I first received them I was fairly worried about the construction quality.  They feel flimsy.  However, they fall on the floor multiple times a day - and still look and function great.  Nothing has ever broken due to the multiple drops.<br /><br />The signal has dropped a few times - but I think it has more to do with our router.  We moved the router and the drops were cut down dramatically.<br /><br />The sound quality is very good - especially voice.  In game friends can't even tell I'm on a wireless set.  They are rather large - and it really muffles room sounds (not that that's a bad thing).<br /><br />The only mildly annoying thing is that sometimes they just turn off for no reason between sessions.  I'll put the headset on thinking it's on and it's not.  They do not turn off while in use.<br /><br />I've been very happy with this headset.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This cover is adorable and sturdy. The kindle clicks in so it's secure and very useful. And I love the bright color.
B0086700CM|5.0|I loaded this on my Kindle and Droid for my grandsons and ended up playing it myself whenever I have a free minute.  It is truly addicting.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|What else can you say. Best Disney movie ever with all the extras you want. Blu-ray looks great on both our players
B0058VW36U|5.0|I bought it for the grandkids and find myself getting caught up in trying to &#34;cut the rope&#34; for the little guy.  Well worth downloading.
B0007LGCB8|5.0|Best all weather sandals around. Great for traveling. Good fit and look. . . . . . . . .
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|These were Christmas gift for four boys, ages 7, 8, 9 and 10.  Needless to say, they had a ball chasing each other around and shooting their Nerf guns.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Great way to play chess. It is easy, you can play it anytime you want, and if you're planning on doing the harder difficulty, you better be pretty good at chess
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Need I say more?  They play it all the time on my Kindle and I can hear them laughing away.
B008B3GP2A|5.0|This is the first album I purchased as I am new to Amazon Cloud and I have to say the album and the service is better than I expected it to be!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have both Yahoo Main and my &#34;regular&#34; Outlook on my Droid and, I must say, the Yahoo Mail runs circles around my Outlook Mail.  Not only is it easy to use, but I seem to make a connection no matter where I am (Outlook just sits and looks at me most of the time).
B0063GORYU|5.0|Yahoo!!!! &iexcl;!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! !! !! !!! !!! !! !!! !!!! !!! ! ! ! !  ! !! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Everyone kept telling me how addicting this game was and, to be honest, I didn't believe them.  Now that I've downloaded it, I find it a lot of fun (still can't say that I'm addicted).  Of course, it's a little embarrassing when I can't past a certainly level and my grandkids take it and get through effortlessly.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|Looking for a good movie on a Saturday night and re-watched this one. Enjoyed it as much the second time.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I was waiting for an appointment with my grandsons when I noticed they were becoming restless.  One of them mentioned this game so I downloaded it on my Kindle and it kept them occupied for hours!
B007FH9GA6|4.0|Listened to audio books of all three books, and watched the Swedish film version of the first book. Liked them all and had to see the &#34;Hollywood treatment. Haven't seen it all yet but so far so good. Seems they combined parts of all three stories which works well if you know the whole story.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Okay, we have this game on the Kindle as well as on my Droid (just to keep the grandkids happy).  They sit for hours playing these game but I just don't understand the fascination.  I know you &#34;build things&#34;, and I guess the variety is enough to keep them going; however, it seems a little boring to me.
0425263916|5.0|I can not believe what he does for her!!!!!!!!<br />I can hardly stand to wait til May for the next book<br />I feel like I am standing there in the room with them, holding my breath, waiting to know what happens next<br />YOU MUST GET BARED TO YOU AND REFLECTED IN YOU THEY ARE GREAT!!!!
0316789798|5.0|I have one grandson that loves to draw so I bought him several of these drawing books.  He loves the fact that it gives him step by step instructions on how to draw something which gives him the confidence to try even more by himself.
0425263908|5.0|love this story<br />I am very invested in this couple<br />Reflected in You is great as well and I can hardly control mystelf waiting for May 2013 to bring me the next book!!!<br />get hooked, you will not be sorry!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I hate waiting in doctor's offices!  Let me repeat, I HATE WAITING IN DOCTOR'S OFFICE!!  Thankfully, I can now keep busy and use my brain matter a bit by using this app.  It's entertaining and quite well done.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|The Dark Knight is my favorite, but it is so lovely to have the entire trilogy in this sleek looking box set. I have yet to check out the bonus features, but the little behind the scenes booklet that comes with it is pretty cool too.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|Anderson and company have completely abandoned any sense of story or plot development in favor of eye catching visuals.  Sadly, the devices used to propel the characters through script suggest that Anderson doesn't understand this; he thinks he's telling an epic story and that undermines a viewer's ability to go with the flow and appreciate the &#34;girls with guns&#34; vibe on display.
0399160450|3.0|I don't know how much this associate author contributes but this does not sound like pure Clancy.  Maybe we are both getting older.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I love everything Anthony Bourdain does, and this is no exception. His candour, honesty and snarkiness make this an incredible read, even for someone who couldn't tell you anything about most of the dishes he mentions.
B00A1XOPE8|1.0|Although already a short novel, this book is way too long with little happening in the middle 80%.  The first and last parts were okay, but after slogging through so much boring material with nothing really new happening, I didn't much care about the heroine by the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great story. I can't wait to read the others. I wish the lending library would let me get all of them at once.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its a great game to play. Sometimes challenging but very much fun to play. I love this game. Sometimes takes up to much of my time.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This game has fantastic level design, tons of levels and tons of achievements to push your skill/luck to the limits. Each course is 9 holes but most only take 5 to 10 minutes or so, which makes it perfect for those times you're looking for a quick distraction (waiting at the doctor's office, waiting for the metro, etc) but you can definitely sink more time (lots more) if you so desire. Definitely pick it up!
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Entertaining and fun to play. The game is similar to cut the rope, but just as fun. Glad I found this game!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|a great game to play, especially if you need some down time to escape from the really screwed up world. highly recommend getting this game. Have always been a fan of G5 games and this one does not disappoint.
B008476HBM|4.0|Enjoyed reading this classic story! I would recommend this to anyone, especially those who love reading about the prescense of mind of those from historical eras.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|This is an awesome case. It is comfortable in the hands and the cover strap is great to hold it open or closed.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|it takes a lot of time to finish a level if you have a lot of patience this is the game for you but if you don't ...don't bother.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This has been one of my favorite books in a long time.  It transports you to a dreamworld that fills you with wonder and romanticism.  I feel in love with the circus just as Herr did and would happily dawn a red scarf with the other reveurs.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I love reading Nicholas Sparks books because I love getting lost in romance. This book was right on course with the rest of his books. I know the movie was coming out soon, so I wanted to read it before it was in theaters.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|pretty good. game. I enjoyed it. It was fun without being too difficult. I would recommend. it to anyone. Worth trying.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My opinion of this game is high. I love this game about its concept raising dragons boss. mostly for people that like  fantasy or mythology. My place on dragonvale is amazing o most every dragon. I will tell u the sun dragon combo because I know a lot of u want that (Blue fire) &amp; (Crystal) that how I got my for real. It may take a couple times. That's my opinion of the game. If it does not work don't be blaming it on me keep trying. I had to say that again.
B005K17RU0|4.0|like the app. would like to see a better EST. almost a half an hour behind? like all the different views available!!
1609611543|4.0|The book is very informative.  Dr. Davis explains with good data why it is so difficult to lose weight even with regular exercise.
0553826166|5.0|I love the Reacher books..what a guy..just buy it and read it and enjoy..great escapism..You read one and you want to read them all. Lee Child has a winner.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is truly sensational! The dynamics of being a teenager to becoming a young womaN story telling is awesome. I'm 34 years old and thoroughly loved every page in the book I couldn't put it down. Now I'm going to look for more of Colleen Hoover's books as this was my first book of hers. READ IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!
B009VSW15Y|5.0|easy to use, not great pixels for enlarging but nice, and has a flash and adjustable settings, easy to share or email
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Language of Flowers was a very interesting and fascinating novel which kept your interest to keep reading to see what was coming next in the lives of the characters.
B007TUAHVQ|1.0|....not for the missing pieces.  I contacted mega blocs for the replacement part on Christmas day.  It is now January 5th and the missing piece has still not shipped.  Total waste of what could have been a nice gift for my son. Should have stuck with legos.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicolas sparks books this book was amazing and helped me realise that you can overcome anything in life
B00454U1NS|5.0|This CD of Pink was great. each song got better and I would recommend it to everyone. She is very entertaining
B0086700CM|1.0|This game frosted my device it wouldn't let me move at all this game sucks I don't think people should get this game that's how bad it is so don't download the game it will mess your device up
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Love Kelly Clarkson and I loved this CD.  She wrote most of these songs and I enjoy listening to her music
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is one of the most addicting games I have on my kindle fire. The colors are bright and there are so many levels in this game you'll never get bored. As I said in my title AMAZINGLY AMAZING!!!!  ;)
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|love the ending of the full story of Harry Potter. sorry to see it end, but I was happy with the ending
B003O86FMW|5.0|Filled with surprises you never see coming in a million years, this book triumphs the first in more ways than none! The end left me speechless and dying to read the next book
B002UNMW7O|5.0|My mother needed a gift for my brother for x-mas and he just loved it and she loved the price!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Was enjoyable but &#34;copied&#34; the original &#34;Alien&#34; movie a bit too much for my liking.  I would have liked just a little more creativity in creating the characters rather than having them so similar to the original movies.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun i can play it but i can  get alot of coins on my other game Style My Girl i can get things on both games
B006VRDZ44|5.0|Steve buscemi is good, the story and acting gets better as season one progresses, definitely worth a look look look
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I have not read many books, as I loose interest quickly. I just could not put it down. Riveting,interesting,great story line. I will definitively read more from Mr. CHILD
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I enjoy this album, but only know a few of the songs.  I listen to the radio most of the time, and the songs from the album are often on the radio.  Songs are for a younger crowd than I am, but still a good choice for Taylor Swift fans.
B003ES5ZPK|4.0|I gave it four because it can stick out a bit if you are having serious space clearance issues (say a flush wallmount flatscreen) It does help a LOT though with getting something tucked in in reasonably tight spaces. I got this to add a streaming dongle to my flatscreen and it cut a few inches off the stickout but I will not be able to have the TV bottom edge tight to the wall on the bracket. It helps a lot though with it sticking way out.
B005LAII6C|5.0|This is a great movie!  The more I watch this movie, the more I love it.  There are soooooooooooo many subtle little references/comments made throughout the movie that we parents would pick up, but would go right over the heads of our children.  There are some scary parts in the movie, but overall the movie is very tame and children of all ages would enjoy it.  It also provides a good lesson that all of our children need to learn at a very early age!!!
B006YTTVHO|2.0|I expected more in depth information. I give this book  two stars based on its brief explanations of educating the reader.
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Nice piece of software that does what it is supposed to do.  It allows me to quickly see any of my remote cameras on my cell phone's screen without having to do all the laborious username/password entries.  It's quick and easy to use.  I'd recommend it to everyone that has a remote IP addressable camera.
B006O6EOII|5.0|el despacho del producto es oportuno, el embalaje es seguro, producto viene sellado y cumple cabalmente con mis expectativas. mi hija feliz...<br />saludos.
B002LMV7TS|1.0|The cartoon is a classic and one of the best Christmas shows of all time. This move, however, stunk.  I honestly hated this movie.  There was no need to build a backstory for the Grinch!  Yet so much time was spent in building backstories for both the Grinch and Cindy Lou Who that the movie felt like it was an hour and a half too long.  Jim Carrey was terrible in it.  His improving through the film made him more of a goofball instead of a &#34;Grinch&#34; who should be feared. I found myself saying, &#34;get to the point, get to the point&#34; over and over.  By the time they got to the part where the Grinch was to steal Christmas, I long stopped caring. Another thing I hated about it was how they made Cindy Lou Who a central character.  That it was her who turned the Grinch. It changed the whole meaning of the show and was unnecessary.  Get the classic cartoon instead.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love those book it includes romance and lots of surprise.<br />some funny moments and some sad moments.<br />You'll love this book i didn't think I would
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This was a really fun game with great graphics. Mini games were interesting and the hints were helpful without totally giving the game away.
B005BCE7II|3.0|Unable to accurately rate, my 3-D Blue-ray player would not play the 3-D movie.  Not sure if it was the DVD itself or my blue-ray.  My blue-ray is brand new but it mentioned something about updating the blue-ray.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I did not write the text below. It was already here when I opened this review screen. Where did it come from? Sort of makes the review pointless if others can write a review and attribute it to me.<br /><br />Not very interesting, nothing new. Yawn! Seems like a money grab like so many sequels or prequels. Save your time and money.<br />I would give it a barely watchable.
B0089K7DGW|5.0|HBO has done it again!  If you haven't seen this series...what are you waiting for?  Love the digital copies!  Very portable for traveling.
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is OK. A few problems I have with it: you cant send gold to more than 3 friends per day, yet the game encourages you to invite a lot of friends but never tells you the gold limit so you try yo send it yo everyone on your list naturally, but it only randomly picks 3. Also the ammount of money you earn is hourly so it takes forever to get anything accomplished. Also, every dragon is the same ammount of food. I think it should be more with rarer dragons and less with common ones. Like I said its OK I guess. Could certainly use improvement. I personally prefer tiny monsters.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This series is sensual and a wonderful love story. Well worth the purchase. I was apprehensive to get, in the end I am so glad I did. If you like steamy love about two people over the top for each other, you must read this series!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|I have had the other two versions of this movie in the past and I like this one the best. It fills in a lot of blanks left behind. Although the sound isn't the same as the Directors cut, the movie is still good. I think everyone should know that war is not glory, not romantic and it is certainly not fair. I don't know why as a so-called civilized civilization we go back to it time after time, war is truly Hell! And this movie does a good job depicting this.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I already had these (not as a set) on DVD but I wanted to get the Blu-ray version for the improved sound quality. It was worth it!!
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|So I see the game is free.. I read the reviews.. &quot;purchased&quot; the free game... 40 minutes ago... it finally downloaded and will not install.. Would like to say if I like the game or not.. but sadly.. guess I will never know...
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|very long, set aside some time.  Very dark storyline.  I'm all for meheime but this may be taking it to the edge of acceptable in my book.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This is an amazing series which was watched by the whole family over Christmas. We can't wait for Season 2 to be released.
B004R6JG7Q|5.0|Great movie.  It's from the 70's so it's not for everyone but I don't know of a better race movie.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|The show speaks for itself. Even if you seen just 10 minutes of just one episode .PHYNOMINAL<br />Don't hesitate to purchase. You won't regret one iota.
B000S88JTS|5.0|This is an old movie, expect that it's corny like the 70's.  it's fun to watch and kind of laugh at but watch adn learn too.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|The games is awesome but I won it on my second try plus slender man doesn't walk but in this game he does which I find that that almost takes the creepy out of slender man but it is a very fun game and I would recommend it.

B002ZG97RE|4.0|This movie was a war movie which followed a different path than most. Acting was fine. Don't expect a Jason Bourne movie. Enjoyed it. Probably won't watch the second time.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I have played this on iphone and now happy to have it on Kindle<br />Love the game<br />Play it on all levels AND like the challenge levels
B005OCFGTO|4.0|After Christmas I saw 3 of the movies on sale for $3.99 a piece at Best Buy. If I'd had time and energy, I probably could have found all the movies and combined them for cheaper than this collection.  However, that being said, the collection is nice, it's all in one box set and very compact. My grand daughter was so excited to open this gift.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|was a fun game just as good as a free game game can get will see how far l can get with it and not get bored
B005K17RU0|5.0|......change the stupid icon it is not always sunny and it gives no clue as to what the app is
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app does exactly what I need every morning. I wish there where puzzles instead of just math problems. I like that I can make my mp3 tracks into alarms.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Fantastic series, never got around to seeing it on HBO so we ordered it via Amazon. At first we just ordered the first episode, but after that we were hooked. So hooked in fact we watched the whole season in two nights and I am now waiting very impatiently for season 2 to be released!<br /><br />As always Amazon delivered fantastic quality when it came to viewing.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I loved this movie!  Just a mixed matched group of people all looking for something different yet the same, who grow together and find something they didn’t even realize they were looking for in the end.  Great cast!
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|The movie was so boring. I prefer the original by far. I love sci fi movies and its pretty rare I'll fall asleep during a movie, but this one did not keep me entertained. It even had two amazing actresses, that still wasn't enough to keep me from snoring over half way through.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I expected a little time in the therapists office and the rest interaction with a lot of comedy, but it wasn't like that.  I got so bored, I finally just gave up and turned it off.
B003ITZBW2|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies featuring Jason Todd. Not many characters unless popular such as the Batman or Superman have a movie. This one was pretty good for me who read the Death in the Family. I was hesitant to watch it but I did. It was amazing. I enjoyed the voice of Jason (Supernatural); the character was done well and I like the script. In my opinion it was done well. However do consider this movie is 75 minutes, this means that it is rushed. Overall it is a good movie.<br /><br />The disks are better for me because I enjoy the Robins.<br /><br />Disc one contains the move and trailers to the other DC movies.<br /><br />Disc Two was good and disappointing. It featured Robin: The Story of DIck Grayson which explores the origin and evolution of the character. I happen to enjoy all the Robins but the problem was this movie is about Jason Todd who took over as Robin. The movie only gave you a small history of Jason Todd from his death to upcoming role as THe Red Hood. It also contains two Batman Animated Series episodes which feature Richard Dick Grayson.<br /><br />The main reason I bought this is because I love the movie and it's the only animation featuring Jason Todd besides a cameo. Jason's background and history is probably one of the most tragic within the DC nation. All the Robins (Male) have been featured within the history of DC animation. Jason's had only  one other appearance which once a cameo in Young Justice. and it was not even for a full minute.<br /><br />I've had this movie for a few days but I'm enjoying it and most likely I will probably watch this every week before DC nation or after.

1400067820|5.0|Antifragile is a wonderful work.  I am so happy I read it, and that I own it for rereading and further study. Taleb took observations made in the Stockbroker trade and has successfully applied them to whole swaths of universal themes and fields. And those in other fields not covered by the book can readily make their own applications.  It has the effect of coloring every decision and other book or article with the thought &#34;How does Antifragile apply to this situation.&#34;<br /><br />Now for the negatives:  He wanders a lot, which is one notable fault, and he repeatedly makes it clear that he was unwilling to accept any editorial advice. It shows.  But it doesn't take away from the book's high value. The non-linear element also lends its own charm to the book's theme, making it more autobiographical than perhaps he intended, which is its own value.<br /><br />It has quite the undercurrent of unsubtle humor of the snooty/arrogant variety, which sadly turned one friend off from reading more than the first third.  His repeated swipes at people who have earned his disdain are &#34;a bit much&#34;.  This is one of the faults I noticed in Ayn Rand's non-fiction; the need to gratuitously snipe at one's intellectual opponents.  After the twelfth time, I wanted to call him and say, &#34;I get it; economists and Harvard professors are stupid.  Get over it and let your arguments speak for themselves.&#34;  But I reiterate, this lack should NOT get in the way of reading the book in full.<br /><br />Another fault is the failure to make the leap to specifics of regular people's daily lives.  There is a little bit of it when discussing the Barbell theory.  But it's just not enough.  And for someone who was involved in trading, there should have been more directed financial-type advice.  I was not expecting stock tips.  But still more.<br /><br />He assumed that the math and graphs were too difficult.  They were not, and quite helpful.  In a nutshell, this was one of my best literary investments of the past decade. Thank you Professor Taleb.
B001O5LVPI|3.0|There were elements in the video that I would not show my 5 year old. I got this for the school I worked at and we had to turn it off
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't usually read books with teenagers as the main characters. However, Hopeless is the most amazing book I have ever read and I am totally in love with Holder. It would be wonderful if every teenage girl could have a Holder in her life. There are many reviews of this book explaining the plot, so I will not. I was so enthralled with the book that I finished it in two days. I definitely plan to read Colleen Hoover's other books.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I was in love with this game. I thought it was a lot better than temple run be because it was in more of a city atmosphere. So why did I rate it a 3?? well the day I got this app it crashed. I had tons of awards and a new board and a new character and I lost all of it. Everything I had played for all day was gone.
0142004413|4.0|This description and recollection of the author's (a brother of Lawrence Durrell) moving as a boy from England to the island of Corfu is an fascinating glimpse into a slice of life that is very different from what most of us are accustomed to (and may be a glimpse of a Corfu that no longer exists - I've not been there to see). Anyway, an interesting take on a very different life.

U will then see a key on the left page, tap to pick up, go back to cupboard and voila! :)  Hope this helps!<br /><br />So, just got game today and I can't put it down! The story line is fun, the graphics are great (I'm playing on Kindle Fire 7 HD) and running perfectly! I love that u get to make &quot;friends&quot; with an adorable lil monkey who is ur helper (u swipe on him in the direction of the object u need him to get)....just a real cute addition to the gameplay!<br /><br />Just an added note, those of us &quot;HO&quot; fans (or any game to that end), it is ALWAYS  best to read reviews before downloading. That way ul kno if it's just a &quot;free&quot; TRIAL (I, myself, had to learn the hard way! :(  )<br /><br />Gameplay is similar to Enigmatis, Ghosts of Maple Creek, Voodoo Whisperer, Stray Souls, et.al, so if u like those games, u will DEF enjoy this one!
B0086700CM|5.0|GREAT GAME! I really enjoy playing this game because u can always improve  your score and challenge yourself. This is my favorite game. It is worth the $0.00 dollars.

B00A9X9TIW|1.0|A lot of build up for very little pay off.  The idea of meeting a future version of oneself is ripe with possibilities, but this film just doesn't get there. Levitt is great though and his performance makes his young Willis more believable, even though the make up is a bit distracting.

SO PLEASE TELL ITS NOT THE END OF  AGENT ALOYSIUS PENDERGAST.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|This staging, performance and recording is of the finest calibre. I have now enjoyed this performance six times over the past couple months and it's impact doesn't diminish. I don't know how it sounds on two small built-in speakers in most TVs, adequate I'm sure. My playback is on a 52&#34; Sony Bravia feeding a Sony ES series receiver powering seven restored KLH model Five speakers. The spectacle is dramatic and the sound is magnificent and both reveal the talents of all that performed, participated, assisted, recorded and attended this incredible performance! I am awed! Cast, chorus, orchestra, conductor/director, staging, lighting, sound, audience all combine to create a performance that draws you in as if you are there live in the best seats in the house! I have thousands of recordings, hundreds of DVDs & BDs, This is the best of the best!
B0053KWDES|4.0|It was a surprise how good it performs for the money. The only disapointment was not able to use it while recharging.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Couldnt put it down. The relationships in the novel are so diverse and intense, they swallow the reader into a world one can only imagine.

B009VSW15Y|2.0|My camera feature works just fne without any additional apps. The only thing that confuses me is the fact that the camera has to be facing the subject, it's like I can only take pictures of myself or  have to give my kindle to saomeone to take a picture of themself. I don't understand or is that what the application is for...so you can just use the camera like any other camera..really bugging me as I would like to take pictures of something other than myself, with my kindle remaining in MY HAND. Sure would apprecate some feedback
B0044WUIHA|5.0|This Tom Hanks Classic is in my all time top 10 movies.  Hanks, stars as an upwardly moving Fed-ex executive that finds himself stranded on a deserted island all alone.  Newly engaged, career on the rise and the whole world believes he is dead.<br />I highly recommend this movie to people that enjoy thinking about a movie for hours after it has ended.<br />Tom Hanks gives one of his greatest performances of his career and has you believing that you are stuck on that island with him<br /><br />Watch this movie and you will be thinking for hours about how life really turned out for this character..

B0086T6XQ2|4.0|This is a successful television series for many good reasons, and it's a bold and worthwhile updating of the 125-year-old, smarty-pants detective story. If there is a true star of the series, I would ask you to consider Martin Freeman as the nothing-left-to-lose, PTSD-afflicted Dr. Watson as being it.<br />The writing, production, and photography deserve a serious mention, since the time/effort alone of designing and inserting the graphics that depict Holmes' thought proceseses had to be created in a way that it enhances, rather than intrudes on the scene. A deft touch in that detail alone, and the show has plenty of small choices that really work.<br /><br />The stories are well-adapted to modern realities. The one quibble I had on the updating was with the casting choice for Jim Moriarty, not in the writing for the character. I found the resulting on-screen appearance wholly un-menacing, which is apparently not a majority opinion since he won a BAFTA for his supporting role. But I voice it so that a differing asthetic is heard, and also to illustrate that I found the show to be entertaining despite this impression on my part.<br /><br />Oh - and the Behind the Scenes interviews contain series spoilers, so watch it last!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow. If you haven't started reading this series. START.<br />You simply will not be able to put the book down. It is a gripping, edge of your seat kind of book.<br />It is simply THRILLING. And honestly.... really turns you on. So sexy, tastefully written, and absolutely endearing.

0060558121|5.0|Although I am not normally a fan of books in the style of magical realism and fantasy, I have to admit that I tore through \\"American Gods\\" at a very rapid clip. This genre busting novel is a well paced and plotted story, wonderfully and skillfully written, and easily can be considered good literature to boot.<br />The book is essentially a road trip which is also a treatise on the nature of worship and the role that gods play in our lives. It is also an examination of the pluralistic society of America, and as already mentioned it is an intriguing and quickly moving tale. I would encourage reading it with a book club or a few friends because I think the novel has many layers that a variety of readers would best be equipped to discuss and explore. As a result, reading this enjoyable text would be rendered into an even greater reading experience.<br />One of the many joys of the text is noticing, and trying to catch the vast amount of mythological references that Mr. Gaiman has saturated the book with. His knowledge and reading in this area must be extensive, as the references are vast and deep in the text. It is a great pleasure when you recognize the clever, and usually subtle, manner in which these references are integrated into the storyline. The large number of them only serves to highlight one of the text's themes, the sheer amount and vastness of belief and the huge role it has played in human history.<br />Although I tore through the book at a rapid pace, I will admit that in this 588 page text I was slightly bored and annoyed from pages 543 to 583. Essentially, Chapter 19 to the beginning of the Postscript is the weakest and most contrived part of the text. After building to a climactic battle that brings the book's themes into sharp focus, this falling action of \\"American Gods\\" was a little underwhelming. However, the novel's postscript redeems it, and frankly even if it didn't I could not complain all that much considering the brilliance that preceded Chapter 19.<br />A real delight was the novel's protagonist, an ex con named Shadow whose sardonic and very dry humor was a highlight of the text for me. His identity is also a mystery, and one is left with many plausible possibilities for who Shadow may really be.<br />This was my first experience with a Neil Gaiman novel, but it has left me with a taste in my mouth for more. \\"American Gods\\" was a thoroughly original and enjoyable reading experience, and one of the best novels I have read in the last year. I will read it again someday, and I know I will find even more in the text than I did on the first reading. That is a mark of a truly excellent work.er 19.<br />A real delight was the novel's protagonist, an ex con named Shadow whose sardonic and very dry humor was a highlight of the text for me.

B000BVMAJ2|5.0|This Duplo Lego is very age appropriate for a 2 year old and up.  Pieces interlock easily for the youngest age.

Not just creating the scene on the box, but also other pretend play can be done.

0345803485|2.0|I absolutely can't believe how much this book as garnished so much attention, let alone being a bestseller!  This book has no plot, no true creativity, and the sex scenes are amateur. The main character, Ana Steele, I wanted to smack with a 2x4 because she's written as a complete dimwitted Mary-Sue, and the romance, I'll wait...<br /><br />EL James had it right, this is her more sickening and gross version of Twilight (and I hated those books too because girls and women alike seem to have been possessed by that foolishness, like this series).  The \\"romance\\" between Ana and Christian is completely undignified and Ana is a spineless, judgmental of twit of Christian's past with Ms. Robinson's, and a low-esteemed schizophrenic with the people skills of a 10 year old!  There is nothing remotely rootable about her what-so-ever and to think there are women who wish they could be in her position because they've always fantasized of having a well-off, hottie with a mess of a life is a complete turn-on.  Come on women of the world, do you honestly know your worth?  Because based off many of these reviews, I beg to differ!  And Christian, 'I'm 50 shades of f______ up' -- personally no arguments there -- he really is!  He's a stalker and doesn't date women because of his strange past with his crack addicted mother.  However, I could defend him better than Ana's character despite there are holes in his character development.<br /><br />I have nothing against anyone who actually practices BDSM, but I found Ana to be so weak-willed and not willing to fulfill too many of the rules in her role as a submissive and allowed Christian to do whatever he wanted as long she got to be near him and \\"change him for the good\\" -- total bull!<br /><br />As for EL James, I don't mind you making your money off these people who finds your writing to be 'riveting,' 'daring,' and 'moving.'.. however, I find your writing to be complete trash.  Repetitive language, no true creativity, shows signs of plagiarism from Twilight and thesaurus abuse -- but I'm sure you don't care since you have pocketed a 5M dollar film deal with the series.  So I doubt you'll be getting much help in the long run to improve your skill-set as a writer, how I know this, Stephanie Meyer didn't bother when people told her to get it together before 'The Host.'<br /><br />People if you are interested in reading this book borrow from a friend, family member or go to a library, but don't waste your money in these tough economic times on such a low-grade read!<br /><br />Rating - 2.5/5.0agiarism from Twilight and thesaurus abuse -- but I'm sure you don't care since you have pocketed a 5M dollar film deal with the series.

I just thought that for it wold be their latest book, that it would be better than<br /> that. But it was a good book . I think the things i liked about the book would be the illustrations like the drawings , and but almost everything .
1416562605|4.0|I liked this novel more for its refreshing style of storytelling than the story itself. The story is the everyday reality in India so no surprises there. I couldn't help comparing this to The Inhetitance of Loss, which also tries to depicts a class divide (among other things). TWT wins hands down.
030758836X|3.0|Not as good as the hype would lead one to believe.  The beginning was obvious. The middle was good. The end was unsatisfying.
B009MF56GC|5.0|I really like The Expendables.  It's great action flick with some of the top action stars of the past 40 or so years.  So, naturally, I was pleased to see that they were making a sequel.  The Expendables 2 doesn't disappoint.  It's great action from start to finish, like the first one was.  The plot isn't overly spectacular, it's a pretty basic action plot.  However, what makes it great is the action, some of the lines, and another great mix of classic action stars.  Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger have much bigger parts in this one, and Jean-Claude Van Damme and Chuck Norris joined the party for this one.  One thing that also helps this one is that it has more humor than the first, lots of inside jokes for those of us who have enjoyed action films starring these  over the past few decades.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray itself is a good product, as you usually get from Lionsgate.  The picture and sound are great and it's resumable and has the ability to set bookmarks, which are always nice features.  I haven't watched any of the special features  yet, but I plan to soon.
0062101897|5.0|This is a great gift for Harry Potter fans. The books is substantial and makes a great gift. My Harry Potter fan-friend nearly shed tears.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|i think the media just likes the sex scenes and catchy title so they bring this up all the time.  It represents the media's ability to alter the news very well.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|The idea for the movie is great - a teddy bear that comes alive, is a life-long friend and circumstances change causing problems. While it was always going to be a comedy, the movie falls into a barrage of crass nonsense almost from the start and never recovers. Clearly as the unrated version it was always going to have below-the-belt humor, but the director lost his way early on. He forgot about the story and tried to make every scene as offensively funny as possible instead. He failed completely. The movie Borat is one of the few movies that (sort of) got away with this type of approach. Ted (the unrated version anyway) fails completely.<br /><br />Don't waste your money.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Awesome! I played it on full screen and it was not blurry at all! Great watch and playback was quick also.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|The general consensus seems to be that the first series of Downtown Abbey is a marvelous British period drama but the second run dipped in quality and turned into a soap opera. While there is some truth in that view, it overlooks one key thing not just about Downtown Abbey but also British period dramas in general. Most of the beloved costume dramas from the UK have a strong streak of soap opera in them.<br /><br />This is as true of programs based on books like Brideshead Revisted and Poldark as it is of the show that Downtown Abbey most resembles - the original Upstairs Downstairs. It's also just as true of the first series of Downtown Abbey meaning that, while there was a distinct dip in quality between the first and second series, it would be a mistake to attribute it to the show suddenly becoming a soap opera. The real culprit seemed to be a lack of focus on the part of the writer, weaving in so many plot threads that not only was it was sometimes unclear which ones we should care about some of those we clearly are meant to focus on felt rushed such as the problems encountered by Mr. Bates late in the series.<br /><br />Despite that, you have to give credit to the actors for continuing to approach even the more preposterous plot lines with conviction. This is most apparent with Brendan Coyle as Mr. Bates whose dignified performance is a stark contrast with the sensationalistic storyline he's been given. Coyle also starkly contrasts with Maggie Smith as the Countess, whose role has largely degenerated into throwing out pretentiously pithy comments every so often whether the story calls for it or not.<br /><br />With the third series of Downtown Abbey premiering on PBS tonight, too long after its UK run for most American fans, the biggest question is not what will happen to Bates but rather whether it will be more like the first or the second. Whichever turns out to be the case, the new series is sure to have one thing in common with the previous ones, it will be the classiest soap opera on TV, and that's not a bad thing.the classiest soap opera on TV, and that's not a bad thing.
B003QSMCKO|3.0|Loved the movie. The quality was well also, when I placed it on full screen, it was clear and not blurry at all.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|A group of us plan to discuss this book in May or June with author Egan and with author Tom Wolfe, who leads an Alumni College book discussion every spring at Washington and Lee University here in Lexington, Virginia. It's just the sort of book Tom likes and so I suspect Tom Wolfe fans (I'm a rabid one) will like it too. I did have trouble keeping all the characters, plots and chronologies straight. The BookClub-in-a-Box Guide for reading clubs, which I downloaded from Amazon.com to my Kindle Fire, has been a great help.Thanks!
B005HSL626|4.0|I have no idea why I find this game so addictive. But I do. It;s a great time killer. lol
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I didn't expect the book to play out.like it did. It was truly incredible. Highly recommend this book to all.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I haven't seen my kids in awhile. They seem to be lost in this game somewhere. They play it on kindle fire and really like it. When the time runs out in their trial, they start a new trial world. Probably a good thing overall, or they'd never put it down.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every Harry Bosch. Each one is better than the last. It's a book you don't want to stop reading but you, also don't want it to end. Now I have to wait for the next Bosch book. Hope the wait isn't too long.
B00417HV14|5.0|Highly recommended for guitar fans.  Bonamassa knocks it out of the park in this concert.  The duet with Eric Clapton is a 'do not miss.'  Production quality of the DVD is superb and the music is just simply outstanding.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|have not been able to put it down. a friend at the office was playing this. he showed the rest of us. then there were twelve of us playing this. it does seem addicting.
B007HOOAH6|4.0|It's a little short, but cute.<br />He likes then a by and how he follows the cat and the dog.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Really fun. This isn't a in depth review, I just wanted to give this game the 5 stars it deserves and I had to type something. You guys are awesome! Again, great game!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I don't know who he knows, or where he gets his information. However, he hits the nail on the head with every book of his. I would not miss any book of his. His understanding of our current &#34;administration&#34; is right on. And his solutions are just about the best we could do...term limits.
B004QX07G4|4.0|Pretty hilarious, I'm a Ellen fan but I would have loved it anyway.<br /><br />I really liked how you could just open up this book and read any where and not be lost. It's just a jumble of hilariousness.
0785814531|5.0|This book was a gift for my 14-year-old grandson, who was unfamiliar with Poe, but had chosen him for a school project.  The content exceeded his expectations, both in the volume of selections, as well as the breadth and type of selections.  Very comprehensive - when he finishes his project, I want to read the book, which contains many short stories and poems that I had never heard of, even though I had read a lot of Poe's works!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|We read reviews that slammed the film, but we figured we would give it a chance. We don't mind campy or less-than-perfect films, as long as they have something to offer. The kindest thing I can say about this disaster is that some of the cinematography was nice. Otherwise, it was a trainwreck. Stay away, even if it's free. You'll never get that time back.
B002C949KE|4.0|Great book that does a good job reflecting on and explaining the errors in logic we make and the way emotion unconsciously creeps into our otherwise rational decisions, rendering them irrational. The detailed descriptions of the author and his colleagues' experiments will probably bore some people to tears, however, but they do demonstrate how reliable their observations are.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|This is a great bargain and I would recommend it to anyone who has a fondness of the Animated Alice in Wonderland
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I got this app to remind me when to take my breaks at work. I truly enjoy this app.  Plus it let's me know what to expect when I step outside. :)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|LOVED IT! If you're a huge nerd or an 80s buff or a gamer - you'll love it a lot!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I had heard the story briefly of Charlie Brown and his crew in \\"Half a Wing, Three Engines, and a Prayer\\" (another good read if you like B-17's), but not from this angle and certainly not this well told! Fabulous writing helps you to connect to the people involved on both sides. What a great story. The only criticism is I read the book too fast! I couldn't put it down. Finished in two days. I'm sure I'll re-read this one several times.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|love this game.... way more advanced then it was when i first played it 25yrs ago. kind of hard to follow at Times but still Like playing it.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|I am a Nelson De Mille fan; wow was I disappointed with The Panther!  What happened John?  Did you make a deal with your publisher to deliver a book only to discover you didn't feel like writing one?  I really felt like this was such a half-hearted effort.  For chapter upon chapter there was nothing but John Corey wise cracks.... and very little story to go along with them.  Interspersed here and there, the wise cracks can be enjoyable, but when thats all there is..... this reader was left wanting and waiting.  I read this book on a Kindle and discovered that no real action took place until I was 70 something percent through the book.... and when the action began it was over before I knew it.<br />I was sitting on an airplane the other day and heard the person behind me complaining to his seat mate that he was halfway through his book and was still waiting for something to happen.  Curiosity got the best of me, so I turned around to see what he was reading, and sure enough, it was the sleeper, The Panther.  I hated to tell him he still had at least another 20 percent of the book to go before it got even slightly interesting.<br />I have always read a new DeMille book as soon as it is published in hard cover; I will be leery of doing that in the future.  I will wait and read the reviews first.<br />I don't know if Nelson needs to retire John and Kate, or retire himself, but certainly none of them are what they used to be.<br />Take my advice, save your money, and if you just have to read it, get it at the library.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|Great reception by those who received this on Christmas morning. None have given me feedback yet from playing them but I know they are happy with the gift. Am going to find a copy for myself in the near future.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank
B008N1V11U|1.0|As of now am rating this app a big fat 0.  I can't properly rate this app because I can't install it.  Amazon should have indicated that this game when installed is1GB; that's most of the Kindle's app space!  Amazon regulates which apps are presented their users for the Kindle; this is why you can't find all Android apps in the Amazon market.  Come on Amazon fix the User interface for your apps and inform your valued customers the info they need to know.<br /><br />I would rate this higher if my Kindle would allow me to install it without UNINSTALLING ALL MY APPS!<br /><br />I'm sure this is a good game.  If I ever play this game for Kindle, I'll rate it accordingly.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|This was a Christmas gift to two our family. They seemed impressed with it when they received it. My wife and I have read the book and thought they would enjoy the CD. Haven't heard anything back yet, but know they will be happy with them when they play them.<br /><br />J. Robert Ewbank
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Fun puzzle game with cute graphics and animations. My 6 year old likes it for the cute factor and ease of play. I like it for the challenge of 3 star puzzle solving. Love cut the rope and love this too.
B00867GHS8|4.0|I've always liked Finding Nemo.  Finding Nemo in 3D adds a whole new dimention to it.  I like my 3D movies.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a great game to play for kids and the adults who are a big kid at heart. Love it!
193609648X|4.0|Crocheters who are fans of Noro Yarns - or of Sixth & Spring's two prior Noro books, [[ASIN:1936096153 Knit Noro: 30 Designs in Living Color]] and [[ASIN:193609620X Knit Noro: Accessories: 30 Colorful Little Knits]] - have been waiting for this book for a while.  The concept is simple: 30 crochet patterns that are perfect matches for the color combinations found in Noro yarns.<br /><br />The book is made up of patterns by 21 designers (including 8 by Kazekobo/Yoko Hatta and 2 each by Mary Jane Hall and Linda Permann).<br /><br />There is a range of skill levels and project types included.  All patterns are written in U.S. pattern abbreviations, and several also include charted stitch symbols.  Here is a breakdown of the patterns in this book:<br /><br />Skill level:<br />12 Easy<br />16 Intermediate<br />2 Advanced<br /><br />Project type:<br />7 Garments (2 Cardigans, 1 Pullover, 1 Skirt, 2 Tunics)<br />7 Scarves/Cowls<br />5 Shawls/Capelets<br />4 Hats<br />3 Bags<br />2 Mitts/Wristers<br />2 Home Decor (1 Throw, 1 Nesting Bowl)<br />1 Necklace<br /><br />Techniques:<br />8 Motif projects (5 assembled using join-as-you-go methods)<br />3 Beaded<br />1 Felted<br />1 Short Rows<br /><br />Stitch Symbol Charts:<br />13 charted in pattern<br />3 charted in back of book<br /><br />I had the opportunity to see a trunk show for the book at the December, 2012 meeting on the New York City Crochet Guild.  I was looking forward to seeing the samples for Doris Chan's Bias Mini Skirt and Yoko Hatta's Flower Blossom Purse and Lacy Capelet.  I wasn't disappointed.  I was also pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the Chrysanthemum Shawl by Anna Al.<br /><br />All of which brings me back to my book review.  My overall reaction to this book is virtually identical to my review of [[ASIN:193609620X Knit Noro: Accessories: 30 Colorful Little Knits]].  To my eyes, this book is presented as an artsy tribute to Noro yarns and not as a crochet pattern book.  While I can attest to the fact that the designs are, in fact, quite beautiful (because I've seen them in real life), there is so much going on visually in this book that it is often difficult to see the projects.<br /><br />Most projects are photographed against walls with floral wallpaper, on models with clothing in bold colors with elaborate patterns or adornments.  It's almost as though the entire layout is competing with the projects for your eye's attention.  Nonetheless, the projects overall are quite lovely (and would probably work well in other yarns, if you're not a Noro fan).<br /><br />This is a hardcover, and it does lay flat while you crochet.  Crocheters who enjoy working with thinner yarns or colors will definitely enjoy these projects.  The range of skill levels make this book appropriate for all but beginners to pattern reading.  As with all pattern books, your enjoyment will be closely related to how much you like the designs.  Ravelry members can view images of all but one design on the book's source page.<br /><br />My overall rating is 4 out of 5 stars.  Though I have concerns about the presentation, the patterns I've looked through are clearly written and the projects I've seen are beautiful.<br /><br />Full disclosure: A free review copy of Crochet Noro was provided by Sixth & Spring Books. Although I accept free products for review, I do not accept additional compensation, nor do I guarantee a positive review. My reviews are based entirely on my honest opinions.fact that the designs are, in fact, quite beautiful (because I've seen them in real life), there is so much going on visually in this book that it is often difficult to see the projects.<br /><br />Most projects are photographed against walls with floral wallpaper, on models with clothing in bold colors with elaborate patterns or adornments.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|It is one of the best &#34;classics&#34; of all time.  It is perfect for family enjoyment and for viewing multiple times.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|best game ever played !! and its FREEE-!!! I do recommend. you guys to get this game!!! the animals are too cute! !!!!!!!!!:)
B003O86FMW|4.0|The first book was way better it kept u on your feet, and this one was kind of slow when the games started then the end was better. It wasn't bad tho
B000FCKGPC|4.0|But still a good read. I love the character development along with the introduction of new characters into the mix!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I said 5 star because this book is very detailed and very very good. I saw the movie there were a couple differences  but after all good book :)
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I agree with previous posts that the narrator needs to be replaced. I did think it had a plot....but it is convoluted by all of the personal &#34;thinking&#34; of Scarpetta salong with other character developments. I will keep reading the Scarpetta novels and will continue listening if they change narrarators.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was not sure would like the book, but I was totally taken by it<br />  Must read. I loved it.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Bought it so I could reread and pick up when I need a pick me up...This series is just a guilty pleasure for me!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Much more fun than one bunch of tiles, you get I believe 8 different stacks to match which keeps you thinking.
B005LAII0I|4.0|This is a very good take on the classic Snow White tale. It is very visually pleasing and the acting was great. It was also nice to see Sebastian and Ron from the tv series Pit Boss in their acting debuts as part of the seven dwarfs. Julia Roberts was great as usual, and the young lady who plays Snow White really pulled it off, she was vulnerable at times and then really stepped up and showed her tuff side when the time was right, and she did a wonderful job of balancing the two, so that you don't fell killer she was just totally helpless.<br /><br />This isn't a adult take like Snow White and the Huntsman, so if you are expecting something along those lines you are going to be disappointed. This movie is more of a family version, but it is wonderful for what it is and I absolutely recommend it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great product and easy-to-use. I like the ease of use wonderful app<br />Recommended for everyone.  A must have if you have a kindle.
B004QL7K6Q|5.0|This movie is great from start to finish. Paul Rudd delivers another awesome comedy. Rudd and Aniston really seem to play off each other very well, and this is probably the best movie Jennifer has been apart of in a long time.<br /><br />The laughs are non stop, and some of the are pretty raunchy, so be forewarned, it has a R rating for a good reason and it earns every bit of it. The characters are just so off the wall, that each one brings their own comedic style, and they are all hilarious and work so great together.<br /><br />Check this one out for sure, you are guaranteed to laugh your ass off, I sure know I did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't put it down. This book was exquisitely written. I would recommend it to everyone. Definitely a must read!
B0067QPVD2|5.0|This movie is a fantastic prequel and it gets better and better the more times you watch it. There are so many little things from the original that they add into this movie. One example is the axe in the wall in the original, in this movie you get to see how that axe gets there, it just totally blew me away. You can really tell how much care and love they put into this movie to make it worthy of being a prequel to the original.<br /><br />To get the full effect you really need to watch them back to back, I swear it goes together so perfect that it is absolutely astonishing. Any fan of the original would be crazy not to see this movie. I believe that J.C. is probably very pleased with how much care they put into this movie to really make sure they honored him.<br /><br />So if you are a fan of the original, or even if you have never seen it you MUST check this one out, then watch the original, you will not be disappointed!
B00846REIS|5.0|Have recently got in to reading and Sylvia day and e l James and there erotic romances are probably the only reasons..... great book keep them coming.....
B008XCPO2Q|1.0|I have enjoyed just about every movie Channing has done, but this one is a total stink bomb. The movie just dragged on, coming in just under the 2 hour mark. The acting was really good, the story just wasn't there for a 2 hour movie, it would of probably still fell dragged out at 1hr & a 1/2, so to push out as far as they did was a very horrible decision. There were a few funny moments, mostly in the dances, but that is it. My advice is to rent this first to see if you like it or would even consider watching it again.Hope this helped.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|Amazing I have not a lot of words to explain it it is amazing I love all the pics and all of the separate boys:)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was not nearly as predictable as so many YA books are. I really enjoyed the story, liked the characters, and appreciate that the author was not afraid to let their relationship develop naturally. I was drawn in by the intense emotions and felt like I was experiencing them along with the characters. I usually love series, but was happy that this was a stand alone book without a cliffhanger at the end. This was so much better than the usual YA romance.
B005FISBV2|4.0|One of these days Showtime will get it right when it comes to new Blu-ray releases for \\"Dexter\\". The sixth season of \\"Dexter\\", as with the previous ones, may have a formula but that formula allows the writers/directors/producers and actors to continue to develop the characters in new and interesting directions for the show.<br /><br />There are marked changes for Dexter Morgan, his sister and his co-workers face some changes (a particularly big change that signals a change in direction for the series in season seven)with the latest season. Featuring Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos, the acting from regulars to the guest stars continue to be terrific.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />With the sixth season Dexter faces the Doomsday Killers (Olmos and Hanks)two men who are trying to bring about the end of the world by recreating key moments from the book of Relevations. Along the way, Deb Morgan finds herself unexpectantly promoted and dropped right in the middle of a scandal involving a high ranking officer.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The sixth season starts off really good (although, if you're sharp you'll be able to spot the twist in this season by the third episode)but by the last third the show comes across as a pale imitation of previous seasons with twists and turns that indicate, perhaps, that the writers were running out of ideas. What keeps the rest of the season fun to watch are the performances from the regulars as well as the guest stars all of whom are top notch. The premise for this season is exceptional it's just that the execution is a bit shakey. Still, for fans of \\"Dexter\\", the show will still be essential viewing.<br /><br />The Blu-ray transfer looks great with a sharp, detailed and colorful look to the show. The blacks are rock solid throughout so if you're looking to buy the Blu-ray the advantage is the nicely done transfer for the series.<br /><br />The lossless audio likewise sounds terrific.<br /><br />Where Showtime continues to fail is in the area of special features. Some people could care less about special features but they do matter to me. There are no commentary tracks and all the special features are only available via BD-Live. The interviews are pretty decent featuring Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren Velez, C. S. Lee, Colin Hanks and Desmond Harrington. WHY they don't have any featurettes on the productin of this season, shooting of various episodes, etc. is beyond me. It's cheap and doesn't reflect well on Showtime.<br /><br />The inclusion of episodes for other shows I probably wouldn't watch isn't all that big a loss (and I really don't consider the special features) but, given that's all that's really included, it would be NICE if it was actually on the Blu-ray disc. I don't uses BD-Live all that much anymore and, to be quite honest, to go on to view the episodes is a pain. Of course, the interviews and episodes (two each) of \\"Californication\\", \\"The Borgias\\" and \\"House of Lies\\" ARE included on the DVD. So, if you want special features and want to pay a little less (and can settle for DVD vs. Blu-ray high def quality), you may want to get the less expensive DVD.<br /><br />Recommmended even if once again Showtime drops the ball in terms of special features (again) and the season, as a whole, isn't quite as strong as what came before.fail is in the area of special features.

B009O07NDY|3.0|Nothing is wrong with the soundtrack, and it is great. Love the orchestral bits and I am so glad they include the sung ones too. HOWEVER! This is what you really want to know:<br /><br />The Dwarf song IS on here, and is extended, but is still incredibly short. They have an extended.... &#34;remix&#34;? of it on the second soundtrack sung by some... dude but it's not really good at all. The big orchestral Misty Mountains piece, however, that is done THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRETY of the movie, is not in here. They have one spot where it shows up in a track for a second but they do not have a nice, long hobbit suite. I am really sad this is the case. How do you miss an opportunity like this besides releasing a special edition soundtrack after the DVD hits shelves? Money Grabbing theives! All I know is I am not the only one upset by this.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: This is a great soundtrack and if you enjoy Howard Shore or the Hobbit this is a must have. It just gets a huge blow for missing what is a no-brainier SHOULD-HAVE on the damn soundtrack. If I am not mistaken, this is even then bonus soundtrack of the two available versions out... so... there is no excuse.<br /><br />Soundtrack still gets a 10/10 review... but the fact they missed this important score slices it to a 5/10 (3 Star). Try again, Hobbit.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This is the most up-to-date techno-thriller every written.  The basic theme is cyber-warfare, but with plenty of the usual Jack Ryan shoot-em-up action and political subplots.  I buy a lot of Amazon freebies (buy?) and 3.99 or less, but I always know Clancy is worth every penny.  Norman
B008I34YYY|4.0|Great comedy film and an inspiration to Indie Films everywhere. Why did it lose one star? Soon after buying this I realized it was JUST the blue-ray (I have no blue ray player) and soon after that... it's on Netflix. So, watch it!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|But that's part of what makes it so much fun! Lots of action, fun effects, cheesy acting in a funny way. We got some good action laughs out of this.
B007THA4FI|1.0|A long meandering depressing story with way too many characters.  Life can't be this bad in any town in England!
B004LWZWBU|2.0|Why did I listen to the other reviewers here?! Seriously, what do you expect from a movie about a bird siting competition?! If you buy this, you must be a dodo. I'm sure feeling like one!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A great read!  Not as flawless as some of his others, but a great read.  He says himself it was less researched than some of his others, and that may be the difference - but I do recommend it.
B0072GPQNG|4.0|Beautiful cinematic work. Speilberg at his best. But the ending was predictable. Too much of a horse-tale. Nevertheless worth watching. Entertaining.
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I enjoyed the book very much, though it's not quite as good as the other two in the series..  I like Grisham.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|We're prudes. Not for kids. Vulgar at times and high a sexual content. Sometimes it embarrasses us to watch it. Hey, I told you we were prudes!
B003ZMF26W|4.0|Replacement for OCZ gaming mouse that's been discontinued. It feels alright. I got used to it but then I'm really picky about how my mice feel.<br /><br />Pros: strong cable, ergonomic, multiple cursor speeds.<br /><br />Cons: not sure what it is but it slides weird on my gaming surface mats. Over priced for style and mechanics.<br /><br />Overall not too bad for a mouse
B002N5N4M6|5.0|We're prudes. Not for kids. Vulgar at times and high a sexual content. Sometimes it embarrasses us to watch it. Hey, I told you we were prudes!
B004SUDQE0|5.0|Just loved it. It was such a fun movie to watch and heartwarming. Very light, which we all need from time to time.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|There are parts of this movie's plot that are just plain mush. I also don't think that they digital effects are that great. Still, fun to watch. Make sure to have a Bane imitation contest with your family or friends afterwards. That's actually turned out to be hilarious!
0529064847|5.0|This is for my RCIA class.  they use it weekly and it has been quite a useful tool for them and for our teachers
B0083SBMBM|2.0|What have they done to comic book heroes? And everything in here is effects, effects, effects. And some of the effects are really dumb. Stupid flying fish skeletons? Really??? I don't think so! The only thing I liked is when the Hulk slugged Thor. Ain't that pathetic?!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is very easy to use and read.  I really like that it keeps your work history.  That's it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game will provide hours of fun. I highly recommend it to anyone, all ages. I don't like the fact that you have to spend more money to beat the game faster, but the flip side is that it certainly keeps you entertained! There are games to appeal to all appetites.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Relive the beauty of Les Mis and the raw emotion of the 2012 movie.  See the movie to appreciate the emotional impact of the songs and the visuals associated with the characters, as you will replay this CD over and over again.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August Pullman,Summer,and Jack Will. I like Summer because she sat with August when he was alone at a lunch table. She was friendly to August because  nobody liked his  cleft  palate.  I like Jack Will because  he  met August and became his friend.  I like August because he was friendly and unusual.  August  is  really nice. Same with Summer and Jack Will. This book  \\"Wonder\\"  is  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!
0375842209|1.0|Haven't consulted the recipient of this present,  but assume it was good,  as they would most certainly have told me if they didn't like it!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Sorry have not finished reading this yet. What I've read is good...good plot and character development. I like dialogue and this book has lots.
159514188X|1.0|She told me she enjoyed it and she has very eclectic tastes and reads voraciously,  so I'll keep supplying her!
B00785P2QC|3.0|Fun... just stupid they always want u to connect with fb which becomes annoying. Fun for something to do though.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|R.R.  You've done it again! This world you've created is so rich and enthralling. When I finish a chapter I can't wait to dive into the next one. Excellent saga! Onward to book three!
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Thus far, in my opinion, nothing has ever quite paralleled her album Stripped, but this one comes awful close.  I think this is the album she meant to make when she made Bionic.  Army of Me is my favorite track.  It's a heavy pop/dance album, so if that isn't your thing (like me) it can get tiring by the end of the album.  Still an excellent album that I would recommend to anyone and everyone.
B00005T7I1|3.0|Was able to watch most of the movie near the middle there was something wrong with it had to use fast forward the get movie to play again. Sad, it seemed like a new movie ...obviously not since its defective.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much its the best game ive ever played this game is the new temple run F temple run from a rate from 1 to 10 I give it 1000 ;)
0525953728|5.0|fascinating book. reading how the soldiers trained and prepared for there missions was very interesting. and the training these soldiers go thru is fascinating
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is a wonderful tradition to watch this movie every year around Christmas!  There are so many great messages to share with your family!  Even though it was made so many years ago, some things never change, like good will toward your fellow man!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I thought this game wold be boring but I it really fun I mean you get to see how good you are and have fun!!!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|this dvd was great my granddaughters loved this. i suprised them with this dvd and they were happy, it came at a perfect timing.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Is this the best movie ever?  Yes.  This is easily the best movie anyone has ever made.  I doubt other movies have been made.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the book and enjoyed reading it on my kindle. Price was reasonable too. I would order more books from them.
B00AH69BPM|4.0|I felt \\"Death Magnetic\\" was a good album, the result of a decade and change of evolution from a trio of guys coming down from a crippling loss. Along the way, Metallica have made a lot of interesting pieces and headed a lot of different directions, but I feel that \\"Death Magnetic\\" was about as close to their 1983-1984 thrash metal beginnings as they've been since even before Cliff Burton's tragic death. Of course, there were flaws and areas that could be improved, but that's the nature of raw music: it's not perfect, which is the charm. As to \\"Beyond Magnetic\\", it's an excellent middle ground between the success of \\"Death Magnetic\\" and the what-the-hell-are-they-thinking of teaming up with Lou Reed for the musical abortion known as \\"Lulu\\". \\"Beyond\\" contains four tracks that sound like they would be more at home on one of their original platters, long, meandering, heavy, and unapologetic. Much as the rehearsal DVD and \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" documentary from the \\"St. Anger\\" sessions, at face value, \\"Beyond Magnetic\\" is just a way of taking stuff that didn't make it onto the album and capitalizing on it to squeeze out every last cent. Maybe that was the idea, maybe not. Either way, \\"Beyond Magnetic\\" is a worthy LP, better even than some of the tracks on the album that spawned it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book and loved reading it as an e-book. I would definitely order again from you. Thanks so much for it!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put the book down! So engaging, felt like I was there. You can get completely lost in this book and forget about anything outside of the book
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book. Good price and so convenient to read as an e-book. I would order it again from you.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is one of the best games i've ever played it is so fun and there are so many different swords and backdrops to chose from, and they also did a good job on jetpack joyride.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|Great story line!  I wish it had more special effects like the others.  I enjoyed the movie but not enough to watch it more than once.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed all three books to the utmost.  And that's from a guy that has not read a book in 25 years.  Viktorvonm
B001706I5I|2.0|Jim Cary is creepy as The Grinch.  In one sceen with him &#34;naked&#34; and the way he moves around the little girl is scary and almost sexual.  There are also some other &#34;odd&#34; scenes....and they way they portray that it seems ok for a little girl to go along to a wierd strange man's house is disturbing.  I would not recommend.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Especially like the ability to create notes by forewarding email and clipping web pages.  Works flawlessly and the UI is pleasind.  I'm filling it up and will purchase the premium version.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This was given to a family member as a gift and she loves the color and the fit on her Kindle Fire. She uses this everyday to read and search online and check her e-mails. She showed me how sturdy and protective the cse is for her Kindle. This item would be recommended for anyone looking for a good quality protection for the Kindle Fire.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ok these three books are so amazingly good! I love peeta and katniss so much!!!! I thinks these books are the best ones I have ever read!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was just too good to put in words to be quite honest. I can relate so much to it because I'm in high school. I'm definitely reading this more than one time. Suggested to everyone I know.
B008JMKN4Y|3.0|Liked that it was engaging and easy to follow. Didn't care for the lack of thought and retribution to the disaster......

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is AMAZING!! I thought that I had it figured out but with all the twists and turns I was on the edge of my seat until the very end. I highly recommend this book!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had already previously owned a copy of this movie, this was a replacement for an old worn out home recorded copy.<br />Amazon went above and beyond with customer satisfaction.  My order placed with regular mail shipping got hung up in Philadelphia for several days, missing the orignal delivery date.  When I used the 'where is my order?' inquiry, to perhaps get a revised delivery date, I expected some song and dance about delivery dates being approximate only etc, but my reply from Amazon blew me away.  Email from service apologized for missing the delivery date, and informed me that they were shipping a copy, overnight UPS, at no extra charge, and if my original order showed up to just refuse and return.  I got my movie, which is one of my favorites, and eventually did get the original USPO mailed order, which I returned as instructed.  Thank you Amazon.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|A breathtaking depiction of what love should be.  True indication of what dedication to one's love is all about.  Fabulous!!

B000BCE918|5.0|Jurassic Park is my favorite movie series of all time, I really wish the seller i bought it from wasn't a jerk and actually sent me this set. The movies alone make this good enough for a 5 star rating, just don't buy it used on here, some people like to send you the case with 3 wrong discs..
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read the book from beginning to the end in 5 hours!! I just couldn't put down my Kindle! If you like reading Harry Potter, then you will love the Sorcerer 's Ring!

1423140591|5.0|One of my grandsons asked for this book for Christmas.  He is reading it now and says it's great.  I have to go by what he says.
0385536828|3.0|I enjoyed seeing the movie, Atonement, based upon McEwan's book and until reading this book was the only exposure I have had to the authors work.  When this book was offered by one of my Dealer's as a Christmas read (it came with a coupon!) and the reviews of the book have been stellar and intriguing, I looked forward to reading it.  I knew of the author's fame but had read none of his books and had no expectation of what waited when I began reading this novel beyond what I had read in the dust jacket and said reviews.  Those sources indicated this to be a spy novel.  I learned at least two things by the end of this book: 1) expectations can be formed on minimal information and 2) \\"Spy Novel\\" has a much broader definition than I originally held.<br /> After Serena Frome (\\"it rhymes with plume\\") graduates Cambridge with a \\"third in Maths,\\" she is unsure what that degree and a rather provincial childhood (as a Bishops' Daughter) has prepared her to do as a livelihood.  The year is 1972, the sixties have helped to loosen some of the societal norms, woman are beginning to be \\"allowed\\" into roles once closed to their gender and an unexpected relationship opens the door for her to work for MI5 (the British CIA).  Her voracious appetite for reading (it was at her mother's insistence that she did not study English) gains the attention of her superiors.  Her skills gain her a promotion to \\"Spy Handler, of sorts.\\"  The \\"spy\\" is an unknown author recruited, unbeknownst to him, as part of an MI5 initiative to influence public opinion by using literature, journalism and the arts.  The story's \\"spy\\" influence takes an entirely new perspective from this point onward.<br /> The novel is tedious in its detail.  Far too much time is spent on describing Serena's home, her dress, the weather, etc., ad nauseum.  The reasoning for such minutiae is lost on this reader.  There are serious adult moments within the telling of this tale, no violence and an interesting perspective of God injected in the midst of its presentation.<br /> There is a point, near the end, where the reader will realize she/he has read this book previously, even if this is the first reading of McEwan's novel.  This is the genius of the novel and the power of its fiction.  The timing, location and culture of the novel intrigue to this turn.  While it is no Gone Girl, the twist is unexpected and fitting.<br /> Overall, I would rate this book more a \\"masculine\\" love story or a \\"feminine\\" spy yarn.  It is difficult to say if this is a Spy Novel with a heavy romantic current or a Romance Novel with intrigue as its vehicle.  This is a good holiday read but one I doubt will garner the author any new awards.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The Art  of Racing in the Rain is a quick read. It's an enjoyable book from a dogs point of view. If your an animal lover this book is for you. The story line is emotional and you can relate to the characters easily.
1619695006|3.0|I liked the book, didn't love it.  She creates an interest in her characters that even if you don't love the story, you have to go along for the ride and see what happens to them.
B008I34YYY|5.0|I don't know about the actual product as it was a gift. But the shipping was good and it arrived in good condition and the recipient was very pleased
0062101897|5.0|We have enjoyed reading and sharing the information from this book.  Anyone who likes the books and movies would enjoy this book.
0143038583|5.0|This book has definitely changed my life. I took a food and nutrition course at my college and we learned everything food...where it is grown, who gets it, the politics, what it does to the body.....<br />This book was a great addition to what I had learned in class. I recommend this book to every person.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Was enjoyable from start to finish.  Liked it so much that I have bought the other Brothers Sinister books.  It's light reading with an easy to follow plot.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I think that everyone should play this game. I know that you will enjoy this game if you will buy it ,so please do and I know that you will enjoy this game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game. It provides hours of challenging puzzles. I recommend this game to all who love puzzles and logic lol.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is inspirational. I strongly recommend that you can see the girl has been a rate of the girl has
B005AUWY2W|5.0|Blu-Ray awesome!<br />The kids really enjoy watching this...the blu-ray disc has been handled roughly by our 3 year old and it continues to work!
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|To be honest, this book left me with an odd, empty feeling. Diary of a Wimpy Kid has lost the comical charm it had in the first few books. When I turned the last page and saw the acknowledgments, I was caught off guard, still expecting more because I didn't feel satisfied. There were very few somewhat humorous remarks, but overall, the story and plot was pretty bland. There were no surprises that made me think or any truly clever moments in the book. The series used to be so much better, but now I'm not such a huge fan.
0689853491|5.0|My 2 year old loves this book and &#34;reads&#34; along with me. It has a great rhythm to it and some repetitive text which makes it fun to read.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The story was engaging, enticing, and overall awesome. The characters had relatable qualities that make you feel as if they could be that friend that you've spent your entire life knowing... minus the godly abilities... I'd suggest it to my friends if they hadn't already read it.
B0038AL7EW|5.0|Sometimes we forget what films were/are about.  Before they were the legends handed down by a people to teach, entertain, make people think, and mold people into better human beings.  Now it is ALL RANDOM ENTERTAINMENT including crappy remakes just to make money, big names putting people in chairs, and \\"cool\\" special effects.  The story is GONE.  BUT in foreign films I forgot I had found there is STILL alot of HEART and entertainment.  It's UNEXPLAINABLE compared to the crap hollywood subjects people to.  They need millions and millions to touch a human heart nowadays?  Well that's how far this society has strayed, again not in many foreign films like departures.<br /><br />It will touch your soul, make you think about what it is to by you, and awaken a sense of wonder in you. GREAT MOVIE worth ten hollywood number 1's that really don't teach anything or get people thinking anymore
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|You should of added that everyone screamed and yelled while Greg was in the bathroom ¡!¡!<br /><br />I really enjoyed it<br /><br />Sincerely,,,,,,,,Connor Martin
B008FYZIVY|5.0|My sister & her husband are able to watch this series on TV, we are not so purchased the set.  We have not begun to watch them but are certain from conversations with my sister that we will thoroughly enjoy them.
B005LAII8K|1.0|Just a few words about your humble reviewer, so you'll know my biases:  I'm an old guy (63), who thinks that among the greatest movies ever made are Richard Attenborough's 'Gandhi', Michael Mann's 'Last of the Mohicans', and Peter Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy.  (You can see where this review is going.)<br /><br /> Appearing in sixty some films, it's inevitable that Bruce Willis has had good and less-good roles.  His most memorable movies are 'Death Becomes Her', 'The Jackal', 'Mercury Rising', 'The Kid', 'The Sixth Sense', and 'RED'.<br /><br /> 'Looper' isn't memorable--at least in the positive sense.  I'm not going to give away the plot, if you're interested in watching the movie; but I do have thoughts about some of its characters.<br /><br /> The movie's protagonist, Joe, is a sociopath.  He is a contract killer, who murders for money whoever is sent to him.  No second thoughts.  The highlights of his personal life--when not on the job--are drugs and a prostitute.  The most positive and popular review, above, calls that 'the good life'.<br /><br /> All the characters that surround Joe are sociopaths.  He does a good turn for a fellow assassin, takes heat for it, and subsequently gives up his only friend to be murdered.<br /><br /> The cartoonish gang, of which Joe is a part, comes after him, and the burden of the movie is comprised of the various gratuitous, bloody gun battles between them.<br /><br /> Virtue is represented by the shot-gun toting Sara, a gorgeous, single-mother and Kansas farmer (!) whose young son has paranormal abilities.  As is every character but Joe, she's one dimensional, just sort of plopped out there among the people of the corn.<br /><br /> Joe has two dimensions.  We know that he was noticed by the syndicate when he was younger and stole a watch from one of the front stores owned by a mob boss.  In a silent part of the movie, we learn that his older persona married an elegant Chinese woman who helped him clean up his drug habit. She was murdered.<br /><br /> I watched the entire movie only because I paid $22 for the Blue Ray disk.  I came out of it wondering why, for two hours, I allowed myself vicariously to share Joe's dissolute, violent, and virtuously pointless life.
0307719774|5.0|I gave this book to my niece for Christmas.  She has a new baby, and her time for writing in a journal is limited.  She called and told me she started on January 1 (you can start on any day) and she loves it!  It just takes a few minutes a day, and she said it will be so interesting next year to see how she answered the questions.  It will also reflect her baby's first 5 years.  Thank you for a great product.
B00AAX68HG|2.0|Nice game- good graphics, interesting game play, but...<br /><br />The free version contains ads. Lots of ads. Static ads and videos- loud videos, even if you have music and sound turned off in the game. Have I mentioned the ads?<br /><br />Yes, you can opt out of the ads - for $4.99. Pretty steep, and more than this game is worth, so it is being uninstalled. I'm glad I played this one before seeing it up for the kids.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I highly recommend this book!!!<br /><br />As a novel it was a compelling read. I read it \\"from cover-to-cover\\" as fast as I could. The plot was intriguing and moved along nicely; the characters were solidly depicted.<br /><br />I grew up in a machine shop, and appreciated some of the details that were included. For example, when Jules adds an air hose to a helmet she describes how she used the tap to create the thread. I've done that hundreds of times and this made her actions more realistic. Details like this would probably be overlooked in a movie.<br /><br />I am a software developer by profession, so the idea of IT was familiar. However, in Wool the IT function was more political and media-control than \\"IT\\". That's Okay.<br /><br />After finishing the book I thought about how \\"complete\\" the story was. It's like a miniature world history of people we can relate to (to some extent...) placed in a \\"smaller world\\" and living under different rules (\\"religion\\"). Whether the author intended to or not, the story touches on survival, political, military, media manipulation and environmental issues. Makes you (or at least me...) think!<br /><br />Great job, Hugh!
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|The average star rating of this title is just about right because although the author may know his subject matter,  he was unable to articulate it well.  I am glad I read other titles before this one because although I got his points,  I also felt irked by the convoluted manner in which the author conveyed the material.<br /><br />If you are a novice who is seeking an answer to  'What is HTML5?\\"  then don't read this as a first book because it will cloud, rather than clear your mind.  Read other sources first, then brace yourself for this one.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excitement adventures intense dark love the storyline and caricatures love how easy but still makes you think very good graphics.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|These Blu Rays have an excellent video and sound which enhances the viewing pleasure for these movies!<br />I highly recommend this series, even though &#34;Crystal Skull&#34; is not that great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator app, not only is it free but it is really useful.  Since it saves the last figure put in when you are finished computing the balance in your checkbook, you can return to the app and the last dollar amount is still there (assuming you haven't used it in between).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series is well written and acted.  I love Natan Fillion and he does a great job with the storyline.
B006YC74E8|4.0|It's free. You can crop/adjust color easily. The only criticism is probably more with the kindle itself...but it is very hard to see the shutter button and line up the camera to take pictures of things (other than your face).
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This is a great movie with a new take on the &#34;musical&#34; style.  I am a musical fan, but this took it to the next level!  Everyone in the movie puts on a stellar performance and the singing is great.  The movie does get a little predictable (as most movies are nowadays) but there were still several surprises.  Rumor Wilson is brilliant, as she is in everything, and she really gets to stretch her wings in this movie.<br /><br />For a movie that had fairly limited advertising support and released slowly, I think it really deserves the acclaim it has been getting.  Hilarious and entertaining, it's definitely worth a watch and the bonus features make the blu-ray worthwhile.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Serena was an intriguing main character.  But she ended up very disappointingly mediocre.  Shirley, too.  I liked the character development, but then they didn't amount to anything.

B002BI6SMI|5.0|Of course, Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors.  This story is intense, well acted and well written. Get it.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I liked how everything worked out but who was Dedee? Teresa? A girl from group b? Otherwise it was an adventurous book
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read the next book. Even better than the movie.  I definitely recommend this series.
0679746323|4.0|I loved Jung Chung's previous book[[ASIN:000714539X Wild Swans]] and wanted to read her Mao book, but felt intimidated by its huge size.  Then I saw it unabridged on audible.com and took the plunge, listening as I drove and flew in the US, South America and Asia.  The authors amply document Mao's great wickedness, from childhood until his final days.  Their narrative is clear and taut.<br /><br />Why then four stars?  Because the authors failed to show what made Mao such a charismatic leader.  What was it about him that made people follow him?  It wasn't only fear...  The book was great, but the side of Mao as a leader was left uncovered.  Still, I highly recommend it.
B0061S073A|5.0|I can't recommend this app highly enough if like me you occasionally let your kids use your Kindle Fire.<br /><br />You provide a specific list of apps they are allowed to use, and Kids Place does the rest.  It gives them a simple little user interface to launch from, and also keeps them out of the system settings screen.  It even locks the home button so if they press it they return to Kids Place.<br /><br />A must-have if you have kids, and all the more amazing that it is free - I'd gladly pay for this app.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|My almost 11 year old loves this game. I would have given it 5 stars but it will not install the update. Honestly I'm afraid to install the update since another free game I had continued to crash after installing the one it had.<br /><br />I also find myself drawn to the game and helping her out after she goes to sleep at night ;)
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Talk about eye candy!  This movie sure has a lot of it.  But even with all the great bodies the storyline is real and dramatic.  Highly recommend it.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This is a riveting book, as usual. I chose 4 starts instead of 5 because nothing will ever top the Museum Murders but Pendergast is such a wonderful character.  I just loved it and would recommend these books to anyone who asked.

B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Looking at him in any other film, I'd never had pictured Gordin-Levitt as a young Bruce Willis, but the guy does something.  I tell you, it's like sorcery!  He gets this look, and suddenly it's not Joseph in the frame anymore but a younger Bruce Willis.  It's uncanny.<br /><br />Aside from wizardry of facial features, this film has a great story, an interesting setting, and a nice blend of scifi with familiar modern setting elements.  Every year there are only a few films that must be seen; sometimes, there are a negative number of them.  2012 was good to the film industry, and this is one of those films that must be seen.<br /><br />Am I the only one who wants to see these two work with Frank Miller now?  ... Oh no I'm a cliche *dies*
B00005LIN0|5.0|The story is entirely enclosed in a black community that lives on the coast of South Carolina next to a fishing harbour. They are fishermen and they till some land for cotton. They live in some kind of a fort that is closed by a metal and monumental gate and that is entirely turned inward onto its own courtyard. The only outside people are the police that comes when a crime is discovered and that is only to make a token arrest since they never get any testimony about who committed the crime. There will be two murders in the \\"fort\\". The other visitors are peddlers. The strawberry lady, the honey man or the crab man do not represent a danger in any way. But the drug peddler known as Sportin' Life is another can of worms. He is dangerous and his role will be dramatic in the story.<br /><br />The story is simple. A woman who is more or less an easy woman is the unmarried woman of a violent man. They are Bess and Crown. She provides her man with the money he needs to buy alcohol and drugs and to gamble. She is entirely mesmerized and dominated by the drug, Happy Dust, and her man. The drama starts with Crown killing another man, Robbins. He runs. The cops want to arrest some bystander, Peter, but he will be eventually released after some time in prison. The main witness that testifies no one has seen anything is a cripple and beggar, Porgy. He appears as being the one who defends the waterproof character of the community. Do not deal with the white police. He is also the one who is going to take care of Bess, left behind by Crown who is on the run.<br /><br />The rest is the story of the fight of this woman between two men, Porgy and Crown, a battle that is lost from the very start but not by the fault of anyone in the community but because of the outside \\"invaders\\" the police and the drug peddler are.<br /><br />The drug peddler has it right when he says that two men for one woman always end up with one man dead and the other in prison, and the woman having no one at all. Porgy kills Crown, is arrested with no testimony against him but under the pretext that he is supposed to identify Crown's dead body, which he refuses to do, even when in front of the body. He is sent to prison for contempt of court. Hence Bess ends up alone, an easy prey to Sportin' Life who manages her so that she goes back to drugs and then goes away with him to New York. When Porgy comes back with presents for everyone, since he played dice in prison and made a little fortune, the community is friendly with him but does not want to tell him where Bess is. He finally gets it out of them and he decides to drop his two crutches and go to New York after Bess.<br /><br />That kind of rivalry between the protector of an easy woman and someone who falls in love with her is not so uncommon, even in the opera world. The new element is the fact that the man ho falls in love with the woman is a cripple and the protector turns criminal. The rivalry between two men for one woman is not uncommon in all spheres of literature and music and the fact that one kills the other is banal, except that here it is the cripple who kills the super strong and powerful protector. The end is purely opportunistic. The woman is totally unable to live without the authority of a man: she is helpless without a man and she finds herself alone. She cannot choose the community as a substitute or at least she cannot resist the suggestion from a third man, the drug peddler who proposes her to go back to easy life in the big city up north.<br /><br />But this opera is a lot more interesting than this dramatic love affair and this surprisingly effective love quartet, one woman and three men. As long as the black community lives closed up on itself it can survive more or less decently though poor but proud of what they can make on the very edge of the white society outside, the society of the buckras. When you get out of this cocoon, you run all kinds of dangers: fishermen are killed by hurricanes when they go fishing. Women are exploited into selling themselves to anyone, into drug addiction and even slavery of some kind when they get out and follow a man out of their community. And it is from outside that the drug peddler comes to bring into the community what may destroy that community. And yet this community is totally pervaded by gambling with dice, alcoholism with whisky and moonshine alcohol, and even common brutality among the members. What saves them is their solidarity in front of the outside white society. They even have a fringe of black exploiters like the undertaker, the divorce dealer, the drug peddler and some others that ransom their own black community for any mostly illegal reason.<br /><br />Solidarity cannot do anything against that kind of easy exploitation.<br /><br />The opera was composed in 1935 and represented a revolution in itself. The action concerned a black community that was depicted as containing normal human feelings and passions and that was under the perversion imposed onto them by the white society outside that both victimized the community with systematic suspicion and made that community close up onto itself into some autarchic functioning that made them accept to be exploited by some black crooks and accept the violence of some of their members even when it became criminal. In other words their minds are totally colonized, under the domination from an outside, surrounding and seen and felt as superior group that dominates them. In 1935 there was yet no way out of this colonized situation except hard work to make a better living in that system but that did not change it, no matter whether they were fishing or growing cotton. Their lot was to be fishermen or sharecroppers. We were at the time still a long way from the education and then civil rights transformation, the main two ways for these communities to open up on the world, for the individuals in these communities to find their way up in society by conquering an equal, or at least as equal as possible position in the surrounding white society. But this opera showed that the situation was becoming highly explosive inside and in the relations with the outside world. It could not last very long indeed because presents, beautiful dresses, new hats were wanted and there would come a time when these people would say: we want them and they will finally do what they can to get them without selling their bodies, drugs or fake divorces, not to speak of coffins and funerals.<br /><br />And yet the composer is not black which means the Blacks are not in 1935, though they are some of the greatest musicians in America already at the time, accepted on Broadway yet. It will take a long time before the Blacks are accepted as equal in showbiz as composers, authors and artists. But this quasi-all-black opera is a very important precursor of \\"Guess who's coming to dinner\\" that was only to come out in 1967, thirty two years and one World War later.<br /><br />But the music is surprisingly modern and avant-garde for its time and even today. It is both melodious with some sentences coming back both with words and notes, but also disruptive of standard harmony and melody, working on slight variations from major to minor tones, and working tremendously on half tones and other intervals that are often taken downward when we expect upward movements or vice versa. It is not jazz but it integrates some of the innovations of jazz in the music and particularly the polyrhythmic aspect of African and African-American music by playing on the chorus as opposed to the leading voice, or on some more distant rhythm that has its autonomy behind the voice, on on gospel technique of a chorus calling for attention every so often in the rhetoric of some songs and introducing a different tempo articulated on the main tempo. Hallelujah! We are like entering a musical forest in which each tree is revealing the whole forest and all the other trees of it.<br /><br />Dr JacquesCOULARDEAUor at least as equal as possible position in the surrounding white society.

B0086213XW|1.0|This is strictly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The female lead in this film acts completely selfishly, which would be fine, but there is no real justification to her actions given or shown to the audience. This single bit of information is more than enough to make the main character instantly unlikable and therefore make the movie dreary, dull, and downright painful to watch.<br /><br />Avoid this non-sense at all costs.
B00957T6X6|2.0|The first book is decent, but it goes downhill from there.  The writing is formulaic, the descriptions are boring, and there is so much unnecessary clutter in the wording, that I wonder if Martin ever had anything edited by a professional.  It is a shame, because there is a really good story beneath all the clutter.  I barely got through three of the books (each worst than the last) and had to give up on the fourth.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|To any and all interested in a wonderful classic. This movie is a wonderful piece to own in your collection of famous musicals.
B005ZUR724|4.0|game is really cool.  it can be a little laggy at times but overall the game isdefinately worth a go, especiallyif you like mmorpgs.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|These books are all about change.  Even though E. L. James is not the greatest writer, the dynamic characters keep you reading.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|I found this game to be challenging and fun as well as addicting. A great game to add to any puzzle lover's collection.
B001NAT05W|5.0|Sincerely, didn't expect the movie to be good:)) I think every woman should watch it  to see the difference we can make ourselves:). Interesting to watch, enough action and twisty plot to keep your attention and interest. The quality of the video was good.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Beats High School Musical completely! It is a fun look at teenage life in college. The songs will keep you singing along
B000ES4QOO|5.0|Bought the book used through Amazon where it was rated in \\"Acceptable\\" condition. I was surprised and pleased to receive the book in what I consider good condition. The illustrations are beautiful. I do not recall reading that this was \\"Abridged for Modern Reading\\" but it states it on the title page.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If only all detectives were like Harry Bosch.  Politics be damned, every case gets equal treatment from Harry.  I hope Harrty never retires.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I finished it because I wanted to know how the series ended but there wasn't anything new or exciting that really held my interest.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|I got them as a Christmas gift for a friend and she loved them! They usually cost about $20 in store, so this was a great deal. Too bad I couldn't find a combo pack that wasn't Blu-ray... But other than that, it was great.<br />Shipped on time as well.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I was really looking forward to this movie.  It is a well-made movie all around with solid acting, plotting and production values.  Character development is average.  Basically, though, this movie is simply 'The Terminator' with a dash of 'Carrie' and 'Shane.'  BTW - telekinesis?  Really ??
B002MQYOFW|5.0|BEST BOOK EVER!!!!!!! I love this book, and the characters and the seam and the woods and the arena and I love EVERYTHING!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I could be on this game for hours.  Its really challenging and fun.  the levels get harder and harder! Its a great app!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I loved it.  We always root fro the underdog, even when they are lawyers. Grisham keeps you on the edge of the chair as always.
B00004W5A6|5.0|There are other ratings on the album.  So my review is a pathetic review of the SACD version.<br /><br />SACD is dying or dead and only SONY and a few others support the format in their bluray players.<br /><br />I have read that this SACD is barely better sounding than the CD version by professionals.  But I thought that on my better than average system with a sony bluray, Yamaha receiver, BOSE 901's had a huge improvement over the cd.  I thought the guitar riffs were clearer.  But then I could be wanting the sound to sound better.  My wife did not notice much difference, but my son did.  Either way this is a rarer SACD and a nice addition to my collection of music.

B002NJWHHA|5.0|It was awesome! I'm going to cry when the sequel never comes out!!!! :( The effects were so good and the end was amazing!
B003L77GH4|5.0|Great Service, it came two days early and I was super excited when it arrived! I can't wait for season 4!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I love the MIB series, it's clever and fun.  MIB did not disappoint and I loved the new plot twists.
1401207529|5.0|This graphic novel is awesome, and is the novel that changed how Batman is perceived.  It shows the dark, scary Batman that we know today and how he got his start.  Very awesome, and so is the animated film for it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I saw this title on a couple of years best lists, and even though I rarely read crime novels I decided to give it a try.  The characters draw you in and repulse you as well and it's tough to fully commit to an accurate assessment of exactly who either one of the main characters really is.  So many lies and so many twists...it's impossible to keep up!<br />wormtowngirl
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I got them as a Christmas gift for a friend and she loved them! They usually cost about $20 in store, so this was a great deal. Too bad I couldn't find a combo pack that wasn't Blu-ray... But other than that, it was great.<br />Shipped on time as well.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Connelly's novels and have read every one of them. At this point I feel I know Harry Bosch like a friend. The Black Box is among his his best books--a perfectly paced narrative written in clean prose with characters so well drawn that even went they do something that doesn't quite make sense to me, I'm willing to go along.<br /><br />Connelly's grasp of human nature, his ability to show the complexity of people, make his novels more than masterful thrillers. They're worth rereading even though you know what's going to happen.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|was a great game.  was a little disappointed when it ended up not free.  it was one of the games yet.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|fun game that gets more challenging as you advance thru the levels. I like the variety that you get from the different levels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome! I am not very good at It but I'm constantly playing it with my brother. But I really wish Mojang would make the Pocket Edition to be like the computer edition a.e. Nether Reactors, spawn eggs, etc. ,etc. Overallxits the best game ever!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|After reading reviews of those product I was iffy about purchasing the case, but it had features that was really looking such as the the revolving aspect. I don't have trouble charging my kindle with the case closed, one simply rotates the kindle. The case does have an odor when you first open it, but it's not bad. The leather feels good & not cheap. With the case the kindle does feel a bit heavy, but at least it's well protected, which is what I paid for. Overall, I love it!
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|Kind of an old person's action flic. Not so much of anything that might put a strain on the heart ... or brain, for that matter.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|but very well done.  I am not usually into the horror genre, but I find the writing and acting superb.  I also love how they are almost like a theater group - many of the same actors from season 1 have returned in completely different roles, which makes me appreciate the writing and acting even more!  Finally, I love how the writers are not afraid to allow the story to take big twists, but can't say anything else about that without giving it away!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It is obvious by the current reviews for this show that a lot of people follow the series. I do wonder though, are people watching because of the gore and fiction, or are people watching because of the fact that it seems that everything in our lives seem a little frail at this time.<br /><br />We have had and are still going through one of the roughest times as a society with our volatility in our economy and employment that it make me also wonder if some are watching to actually learn how to survive when there is no structure or law to protect us.<br /><br />Personally I seriously doubt that the day will come when &#34;we the people&#34; take back what is rightfully ours. All I can say is bring it on! I have fought my entire life from a nobody dope head drop out kid to actually taking charge and doing something with my life.<br /><br />Back when I was in my late teens and early twenties I though how I would have it made if I could only bring home $400 a week. I now bring home three times that and I am still living paycheck to paycheck and the government thinks that its OK to take a little more. When is enough enough?<br /><br />The show is great and has made me do a little soul searching to decide if the world as we know it today ended would I be able to survive and protect and provide for my family. In the end I say hell yes!!! I am ready, I beat Mr Osama, oops, I mean Obama's assault rifle ban. Therefore I can protect myself as my forefathers expected me to be able to.<br /><br />You see when the stuff hits the fan I really don't want the criminals to be the only ones with a weapon which is apparently what some very naive people believe is the answer to stop gun crime. Hello!!! anyone listening? Criminals will always have access to guns to commit crimes!!! It is the law abiding citizen that becomes a defenseless victim when they are disarmed.<br /><br />5 stars to The Walking Dead!!! because I believe there are some that will understand what it means to be defenseless.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I am a newly converted Taylor Swift fan and have started listening to her previous albums, which are really good. Just downloaded the new Red album and it is great! Highly recommend!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Great book that I enjoyed reading. It is a good starter book to refer people to who say they do not believe in heaven or hell.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|Nice layout and easy to use but if you are repeating the same formula calculations with different variables, it will not hold the formula so that you only need to enter different s,y variable values.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Interesting look at cyber warfare.<br /><br />more woods eat pigs and sheep and dogs and omg this thing needs so many words
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I love the story very close to the comic book. I like the price I paid for it. It is a good buy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I enjoy the Suspense of what will happen next and how the characters are developing.  I go from not liking one at all to finding myself liking them.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Granddaughter wanted this app for her kindle fire. She absolutely loves the interaction. She can practice her styling ability as well as her hair designs.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very good game'it keeps you suspense.  Very challenging.  I am not much on search games but this one was a good,  even playing on a kindle fire.  Well worth the money.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Got the movie for my son...he has all the video games.  He enjoyed it very much, at least having his own copy.  The movie is broken up into segments on one of the games already though/
B009YP9L7U|4.0|If only the story could be true......<br /><br />The story was written well and is an easy read. But the characters were too perfect.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I love the story very close to the comic book. I like the price I paid for it. It is a good buy.Blu-ray is the way to see this movie.
