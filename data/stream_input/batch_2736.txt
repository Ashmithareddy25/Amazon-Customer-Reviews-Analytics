B0012HF5NC|5.0|One of the best classics, the plot is great, action, actors makes your eyes stay glued to the screen till the very end. Kids absolutely loved it,
0307730700|5.0|I work 12+ hours a day, often waking up as early as 4:15 after 6 hours of sleep.  It's not the worst of situations because I'm fortunate to have a job, home, car, etc.  However, it requires some motivation from time-to-time.  If you find that you're also in need of motivation, this is the book for you.  If Adam Brown could overcome drug use, lose an eye, and have his hand badly injured in an accident, then what can't you or I do?  Initially I read books like this to hear the story of those who have served our country so well, but I come away with so much more in the inspiration that such stories bring.  This may be the best book I've read, of any genre.  I appreciate the Christian values that Mr. Brown upheld and how this book was so civil and polite.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This movie is great. If you love Jane Austen, then you will love this movie. Actors did a wonderful job.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is great game :) its kinds like temple run it very good for when you get bored and when youate stressed
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love the group Fun, their harmonies and music are so original and refreshing. Voices on the album are wonderful.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Hooked and cannot wait for the next Crossfire book.  Once you start it is very hard to put down.  if you enjoyed Fifty Shades, you will enjoy this one too.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved this book, so heartbreaking at some points but so well written I never wanted it to end!  A great read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Found on the free deals and it was very cute read.  Quick read also finished it a matter of hours.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|The book really kept your attention and wanting more. It was a love story but also showed downfalls which is appreciated because life isn't always rainbows and sunshine.
B008KRJWEK|5.0|The game is ok and is hard to get coins though so please give me a yes and I really hope you like the game
0802473156|5.0|This is a really great book. So easy to read and interesting. It turned my relationship around completely.  I think everyone should read this.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|But how can HE be the father if he's from the future?! You know what I'm talking about. Gotta watch the 2nd one now.
B00C5ZORES|3.0|While this latest effort is not as solid as their last two CDs, it successfully delivers an enjoyable pop-rock experience.
030758836X|3.0|Definitely has you on the edge of your seat and I couldn't put it down because I had to know what was going to happen. But it starts getting ridiculous halfway through and the ending is unsatisfying (which Flynn did purposefully, I'm sure, but still...).
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love this DVD. It is faithful to the Harry Potter series of books, and is visually quite good watching.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This show has all the necessary requirements to be a hit and remain a hit . A supremely self confident and habitually winning lawyer with his equally proficient Secretary slash possible ex-love interest. A pot smoking, photographic memory, genius on the run from the police and his love interest. A manipulative self serving majority partner and a scheming, backstabbing junior partner. With all these different personality types and a better than most writing team there can be no other outcome than an intriguing and ultimately satisfying legal romp.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|It was a good summer read. Probably will make good movie. What more is there to say. Too many words
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Some of the levels can be very difficult, but it's still a fun game to play.  It really makes you think.
B008M87GJK|4.0|This is an awesome app that would get 5 stars if it had screen rotation.  Annoying, but I still recommend.
B00DCX08MW|4.0|Operates very similar to a real aircraft.  Way to brief, not enough scenarios, I would like more than the 12 there.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was a great third novel in this series and I can't wait  to see what a fourth will offer. The story line is compelling and every bit as entertaining as the 'FIFTY SHADES' series.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This show has everything. Drama, action, twists and classic root for the underdog plot. The cast has great dynamic and you almost feel a part of the futuristic western. A must see for all sci-fi fans, or for anyone interested in a captivating plot
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a lovely and strange story. Beautifully written.<br />Evokes incredible imagery. It was like reading a painting. This book has made me curious to read more Gaiman.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|I was a huge fan of World War Z the book, so I looked at this movie with skepticism when I figured out they had made it an action movie. I was also worried about the PG-13 rating. Yes, it isn't the book and you can say it is loosely based on the book...but this is an excellent stand alone zombie story. They have found a way to really make this a terrifying scenario and there were several parts of the movie where I was literally holding my breath. There really isn't much gore in the movie and I noticed I didn't even miss it one bit. Overall, I can say it is an very fun and exciting summer style blockbuster with zombies....millions of them...billions...running very fast.  Worth watching!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have had TWC on my kindle for a long time and was very satisfied. Out of the blue comes this new version and it is awful. Worst piece of crape ever. I want the old version back.
140006922X|1.0|John Dickerson wrote the following on Foxnew.com. I could not agree more.<br /><br />Media reports have introduced Aslan as a \\"religion scholar\\" but have failed to mention that he is a devout Muslim. His book is not a historian's report on Jesus. It is an educated Muslim's opinion about Jesus -- yet the book is being peddled as objective history on national TV and radio.<br />\\"Zealot\\" is a fast-paced demolition of the core beliefs that Christianity has taught about Jesus for 2,000 years. Aslan is not a trained historian. Like tens of thousands of us he has been formally educated in theology and New Testament Greek. He is a bright man with every right to hold his own opinion about Jesus--and to proselytize his opinion. As a sincere man, Aslan's Muslim beliefs affect his entire life, including his conclusions about Jesus. But this is not being disclosed. \\"Zealot\\" is being presented as objective and scholarly history, not as it actually is--an educated Muslim's opinions about Jesus and the ancient Near East. Its conclusions are long-held Islamic claims--namely, that Jesus was a zealous prophet type who didn't claim to be God, that Christians have misunderstood him, and that the Christian Gospels are not the actual words or life of Jesus but \\"myth.\\"<br /><br />As a journalist and author who is Christian I cannot imagine penning a so-called objective biography of Muhammad and then concealing my conflict of interest in national media interviews.<br /><br />\\"Zealot\\" is written with the self-assumed authority of groundbreaking revelation from a historian. In reality, it is a religious person's opinion about Jesus--from an adherent to the religion that has been in violent opposition to Christ for 1,400 years.<br /><br />Aslan informs us that we cannot trust the Gospel of Mark--because it was written 40 years after Jesus' death. He then chides us to trust his new book, written almost 2,000 years later.<br /><br />I believe in Aslan's right to hold and propagate any opinion. It's a right that, ironically, Christians do not have in many Muslim countries.<br /><br />Pouring praise onto \\"Zealot\\" as new information about Jesus, without explaining its author's devotion to a combatting religion, is blatant bias. This same bias would be unthinkable if the Christian and Muslim roles were reversed.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I am a huge John Grisham fan and thoroughly enjoyed this collection of short stories. Grisham writes in such a way that the characters come to life, but doesn't lose sight of the main point of the short story. I recommend this collection of short story reading.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I know it's a trite line...My twelve year old granddaughter taught me how to get this app, which is probably why i enjoy it since I think of her each time I use it.
B000W9399S|4.0|I went back and forth about whether to give this 3 or 4 stars.  In the end, I liked it a lot more than I thought I was going to.  I will download the next one to my kindle.  This is good for people who don't take their fantasy books too seriously.  It can be very funny for most of the book, but it could also drag at times.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is the best game ever I recommend it plus it's free it's like mario except on android if you get this u won't regret it the NER brothers are awesome at 2D games can't wait Until three
0786958731|4.0|Whether or not you are a fan of the D&D RPG, this stylized board game is a good time. If you are a fan of high fantasy in any format (literature, RPG's, films, computer games, etc.)you should find this game stimulating.<br /><br />The Highlights:<br />*the game system is easy to learn and plays smoothly (for the most part...see \\"Drawbacks\\" later in the review)<br />*the pieces are very well made, especially the miniatures<br />*allows for creation of additional adventure scenarios<br />*great variety of playing pieces<br />*can be played in a short amount of time; 45 min.- 1 hour<br /><br />Drawbacks:<br />*Rules: I'm not a fan of a monster automatically being placed on every tile; i.e., I like it to be a bit more random. This is more of a personal dislike of the game system. I've played traditional D&D (RPG) for over 3 decades and like \\"wandering monsters\\" to be more random. I made some house rules with my own random encounter chart and monsters only appearing on a roll of a 1 or 6 on a d6. In my house rules, black triangles on the well-crafted cavern tiles call for a random roll as well as an automatic encounter card draw whereas white triangles only call for a random roll for a monster.<br /><br />Once I worked in this house rule, the game seemed much more enjoyable to me personally. Others may not find the automatic placement of a monster on every tile to be an issue.<br /><br />I also don't like the fact that your movement stops once you reach the edge of a tile. Thus, again, I interjected a house rule in which players may continue their movement onto a newly placed tile during their \\"hero\\" phase of a game. Basically, this somewhat combines the \\"hero\\" phase of a turn with the \\"exploration\\" phase in which new tiles are placed. Otherwise, if a hero stops at the edge of a tile, which calls for the placement of a new cavern tile, he/she will automatically be attacked by the monster that pops up on the new tile! Under the rules as they are written, the player essentially NEVER gets to attack first in combat when a new tile is placed. By allowing players to advance onto a newly placed tile the heroes can attack if they can reach the monster with whatever remains of their allotted movement.<br /><br />*Storage requires plastic baggies in order to keep the plethora of pieces separate (this is a minor complaint; don't let it keep you from purchasing the game....the variety of pieces is one of the true strengths of this product)<br /><br />Overall:<br />The game is quite fun with or without modification. If, like me, you don't like some of the features of the rules such as a monster appearing automatically on every tile and monsters that attack first every time you place a new tile, then a few house rules will facilitate play. This is a nice replacement activity for those D&D players that, on a given night, might not feel up to role-playing or might not have the time for a traditional D&D session.ially NEVER gets to attack first in combat when a new tile is placed.

B0036OS3F6|4.0|I couldn't believe how light these shoes are when I first got them. You can barely feel them. Two winters later, they are starting to leak a little bit, I think, but they served me well.
B00009Z574|5.0|I like Yes and I love Tormato when I bought it in 1980 on vinyl.  Now I got it on CD I still enjoy the songs on the album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This might be a book aimed at teens, but grown ups who have some knowledge of popular culture and world history will get a lot out of reading this book as well, probably even much more than the kids, who have never heard of gladiators, never watched reality TV, and don't know about much about the history of Nazi Germany or the Soviet Union.
B005SJIP2S|5.0|I loved it.  The CD explaining the choice of singer was very helpful.  I could not have been more satisfied.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I am a fan of Hosseini's and eagerly awaited this book. Unfortunately, there are too many points of view and jumps in time and place, and when they changed it often took several pages before I was sure who was telling the story, when, and where. I most enjoyed the beginning and the end but the middle third was disorienting.
B00AIBZJLG|4.0|Admittedly, there is not much new here with regard to the Cirque presentations. in fact, I recognize many of the acts from previous touring shows I have attended. However, the blend is different and the performances just as splendid.
B0070Z97LG|3.0|Good movie to watch if you want to be sad.  Didn't quite expect the ending but was suspicious of something strange during the course of the movie.  Might recommend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I absolutely love this game. The funny kill sentences. But the mines are really annoying:(<br />And it doesn't auto update<br />Amazing game overall
B009329ZF2|2.0|Did not like.  More for a kid who likes action movie.  Would not recommend to friends.  Don't think they would be too impressed.
B004EPYZV2|4.0|If you have a awesome 7.1 sound system this is a bad ass movie. The sand storm was amazing. Hearing the sand blow by with the wind whistling past you.  OH YEAH!  you just got to listen for your self.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Story line really weird but liked it.  Unusual movie.  Liked the actors and thought they did a good job in this one.  Jennifer Lawrence was very good in it.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|WHAT can one say about a movie, when they can't find a American to portray the son of a u.s icon. like when they got an irish<br />man to portray ROB ROY! that said the actor wasn't bad but I suspose we all came to see BRUCE once he arrived the action never stopped but why did they have to go to a radioactive location all those baddies with their protective suits and bruce and son in<br />t shirts, makes one wonder, but all in all, lots of action, lots of swearing, and the good guys win, and BRUCE says there's one more<br />then he'll hang up the T'SHIRT, won't be the same. the cuz
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Would recommend.  Very unusual movie.  Very mystical.  The cinematogrophy was exceptional.  Thought the boy did a good job of acting.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Having been given this book as a present, I was originally sceptical about reading it. There are so many books which have been written about the war, and so many of them are extremely similar and very repetitive. Therefore, I was not particularly enthusiastic about reading it; but that all changed by the time that I had read the glorious opening line of the book.<br />This book is entirely different to any other war books which I have read; it is certainly in my top 3 favourites of its genre (along with Louis de Bernière's \\"Captain Corelli's Mandolin)and it deserves to be read.<br />First of all, the characters are very realistic. You warm to some of them; you are disgusted by others,and, most surprisingly,you get the impression that all of them are real people (although they are actually all fictitious). The plot is so engrossing that you feel as though you are in the book yourself,that the protagonists live down the road from you, and that you are experiencing the same trials and tribulations of life as they are. Although I finished this book a week ago, I keep thinking about the protagonists and their experiences.<br />In addition to this, unlike other books which are set in the same era, this book does not glorify the \\"goodies\\" and the victims of war whilst antagonising the \\"baddies\\" of the war. It analyses the perspectives, positions, situations and difficulties in which all parties found themselves at a given time, and discusses them neutrally, so that the reader can understand that life was not easy for the Jews or for the Germans at the time; that both parties often found themselves in difficult positions and had to resort to great lengths, because their lives and/or the lives of others were in danger, and drastic measures needed to be taken in order to save them. To illustrate the situations of the protagonists, C Fischer analyses what happens to various Jewish, German, Czeck, Slovakian and Austrian families before, during and after the war. It becomes clear that the stereotype which is presented in other books which were written about this period in time is far from being accurate: not all Germans at the time were evil, and not all Jews were angels.<br />Furthermore, one can learn or consolidate one's historical knowledge by reading this book, because, as a work of historical fiction, it is filled with historically accurate facts, events, and even a map of the area which is described in the story. The amount of reasearch which C Fischer must have carried out in order to write this story as accurately as he has is astounding.<br />Whilst reading this book, you will feel fear, sadness, joy and excitement. C Fischer has managed to weave all of those feelings into a wartime plot, which is quite remarkable (one does not expect to laugh at anything which is occurring under the terrifying Nazi regime). Moreover, C Fischer approaches even the most gruesome of events with a significant amount of tact and of respect: the reader understands what he is describing although it is not described in graphic detail in the story.<br />I recommend this book to anyone aged 13 and over. It is thoroughly enjoyable.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Disappointed.  Thought is would be more of a mystery than about alcoholicism.  Depressing to say the least. Would not recommend.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Helps us understand the hardships of being different and that different people are still people. I love this book and I am happy I bought it
B007REV4YI|5.0|I think that this is one of the best Bond movies.  No special gadgets, but a good story.  The ending is totally unexpected.  In Blue-Ray tdhe special effects are wonderful.
0812550706|1.0|First of all their is no action what's so ever,and the ENTIRE book is just about a kid goin to milatary school and how does OSC take 320 pages to explain that!!!!!!!! This may be a short review but this is all I have to say about this!!!!!
B0090SI4LU|1.0|This movie is what it is.  If you liked the Twilight movies, well, maybe you can tolerate it.  For everyone else, this movie is a complete waste of time.<br /><br />The basic premise is in the future, an alien race has invaded Earth by inhabiting the bodies of humans, controlling their actions.  A few isolated pockets of resistance remain.  One resistance fighter, an early-20s young woman, is captured and becomes a host for an alien named Wanderer.  Wanderer finds that the original host is still resisting the alien presence.  The host likes one guy, and the Wanderer likes another guy.  They are conflicted.  Hijinks ensue.<br /><br />In the middle of an alien invasion, when trying to reclaim your world, the most important issue is to count the number of hot boys who like you.  Thank you, Stephanie Meyer, you know your audience.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Le Carre never disappoints me.<br />And the theme is very up-to-date and relevant.<br />The characters are so real I became immersed<br />and couldn't put it down!
B00004XP35|4.0|I like the album, a lot. Coldplay got me into music big time and this album was a big part in that.<br /><br />The vinyl is 180 grams from what I can tell, so it's exquisite in that regard, mine just plays a little weird. All-in-all it's is a fantastic purchase for anyone seeking great music with that classic sound.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a fantastic escape game but I feel like it should have taken much more time than it did. Loved it though!
1595828753|3.0|There are no plot-giveaways in this review.<br /><br />While I honestly enjoyed reading this graphic novel, I must admit that it covers my least favorite part of the Promise Series. It almost feels like an attempt by the author (Gene Yang) to elongate the story. It seems this way because most of this book was about the subplots that revolved around the main story. Considering that this series is already a subplot and is a supplement to the TV show, I thought this was a waste of time. This novel focuses on Aang and Katara's relationship and Toph's metal bending academy. It rarely illustrates any confrontation between Zuko and Ozai. Thus, the cliff-hangers that were released at the end of The Promise: Part I will go unanswered.<br /><br />The story in it self was good but it was not meant for this book. As I said before, I think the series was elongated, that too, for financial reasons. Nevertheless, if you feel like collecting all the Avatar books, this is a good buy.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Excellent series.  A lot of characters to keep track of - it helps if you've read the book, but it's not necessary.  A lot of nudity, but it is part of the story.  The acting, scenery, and writing are all top notch!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I like the new app a lot. The one item I can not find is the official Sun up and Sun down times.
B0053TMP24|3.0|This book is a really fun read. It gets slow at a few points, but if you stick with it, you'll like how it turns out. Would definitely recommend the whole series.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game even though it is exasperating at times.  I love a challenge and this game fills the bill!
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Both my wife and I loved this movie. We can't wait to see the next one when it comes out next month
B0091REZMW|1.0|I've had this game since February and really enjoyed playing, but now suddenly it's no longer compatible with my tablet. If this hadn't happened I would have given it 4 stars. If they fix this I will change the rating but the game is useless at this point.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Best device ever from Google.
B008JD7VZM|5.0|My son loves Lego and he loves Minecraft so of course he couldn't wait to spend his allowance on this Micro World.  It truly is a small set but my seven year old had a great time building it and he incorporates it into almost everything he does.

B003G4W49C|4.0|This was one of those books that the ending saved it. And now I gotta read the sequels of course.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|It is a great movie.. Much Better than I expected... Love it.  Not just like some movie with many viewers but no meaning I the story.
B000QFQE4U|4.0|The story was portrayed well by Denzel and Angela Basset, however, much more could have been presented about his conversion to the universal Islam as practiced worldwide. That was the true turning point in his life.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Love the 3 D effect.  Great movie !  I have watched it three times.  The story is not too difficult to predict the ending.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|Everyone in the entire world should watch this movie.<br /><br />Even though the movie is listed as fiction, the science is spot on concerning how global warming can cause an Ice Age.<br /><br />I highly recommend you to buy this movie.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid was outstanding in his performance.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|Great movie for all age group.  The 3D effect is fine. I am really enjoy it.  My kid love s it as well.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Watched the entire season in a little over a weekend. I'm a huge fan of this series. Love every episode, as usual. Now waiting on Season 8! I'm missing the Winchester boys!
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|I have watch the movie twice and love it.  My kid watch the movie several time as well.  He loves it very much!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|It's a really good app I think. It takes away all the junk on your Kindle Fire and makes room for more things.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome fun and great challenges with friends. GOAL after GOAL. Readily available coins. Great competition non stop. Hope to see more worlds and c challenges for coins.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is one of my favorite apps for relaxing and the fact that at the time it was FAOTD makes it even more amazing.i use this in my classes for cool downs and for myself to sleep after a rough busy day. Just superb.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|First saw it on the cable channel then had to order it.  The weekend it arrived we watched it about 10 times!  The music is a much of the plot as the story of the kids.  Love the chemistry between each of the characters.  Be prepared to sit back and enjoy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very addicting and so much fun. I love the movies, so glad they came out with a game. It's just perfect.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|No wonder its so cheap....the quality is awful. Pictures and videos do not come out clear at all. They are foggy and blurry looking. Who knows this may not be a defect in the camera, but in the kindle at any rate it's no Good!!
B003D83DPA|5.0|Anyone who is a fan of what I call &#34;Jam Bands&#34;, or anyone who is a fan of music in general would do well to buy this concert. Dire Straits was one of the best bands in the 70s and 80s, and received what I consider too little acclaim for their music. It's an older concert, so the film isn't the best, but the sound is top notch and sounded great in DTS 5.1.<br />Buy this concert.
B002MGR18Y|3.0|I thought it was ok. Its not the most amazing scary movie Ive ever seen. But if your into &#34;I Spit on Your Grave&#34; or &#34;Straw Dogs&#34; you will probably enjoy this.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I liked this book but it fell short in comparison to Hosseini's last two books.  Its pretty depressing but that is not unusual for this author.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love this game, it's great for when I'm bored. The ads are annoying but ads are everywhere, right? I LOVE horses so much and this game is pretty cool.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I thought this second book in the Trilogy by Follett was better than the first one, Fall of Giants.  My only criticism is that at times I got bored reading about the Russian history and wondered how much of it was accurate.  Other than that, I loved the book.  I'm a big fan of Ken Follett.
B001EC3JME|4.0|Very robust and tough. Good Material. Fits on waist belt nicely and its 90 degrees turn is a good feature.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Loved it as well as the first. I would really like to know how it all ends.  Guess I'll have to wait for the next installment.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|It must be great to be king!!! This is a very entertaining series from Showtime. It takes a bit of &#34;Hollywood licence&#34; from a historical viewpoint. But that is what makes it addictive. It is well written, well acted and very entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If your looking for a show to keep you on your toes and great acting.... If you arent already hooked by Season 1 & 2..... You surely will after season 3. Amazing writing and great acting. I love the variety of characters and the constant moral/ethical questions and situations the characters deal with. Amazing!!
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Action after action.  Bruce Willis is at it again and still comes out looking good.  Well worth the money.  Some of the action scenes are unbelievable and the stunt men that did them were awesome.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is a great children's game .It is a lot like subway surfers but this game seems to have more tragical.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this was a great game and I really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this to people. worth every penny that you spend.
0375842209|5.0|Good read ....teen agers as well as adults who remember WW2 .<br />Story of German neighborhood. A young girl who loved books and<br />Her way of finding them.
B008MVP97S|4.0|My husband liked the colour combo and crocs can be trusted to last. Item is as described on web page.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very challenging. It really gives your brain a work out. I would definitely recommend it to others!
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Wonderful,  I think it is very easy to do and it doesn't cost any money for membership or other fees.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the most popular game I play it all day every day it is so so so so so so so awesome
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was loads of fun. I would recommend it to anybody. I wish there were more levels. This game could do big things like candy crush.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game may need A LOT of updates for it to be exactly like the PC version, BUT this game is just plain old amazing. Period. The updated graphics make the smooth lighting look a good amount like the lighting on PC Minecraft. I wish that they would use the Redstone update instead of the 0.7.1 or whatever update was most recent. Still, I like how they added spawn eggs, the actual Nether (Just a big tower of Netherrack Witch spawns Zombie Pigmen, quarts, and other good stuff), Armor, and Realms. I can't wait for next update!!! (I think next update is the Redstone update :P
B003ODIZL6|3.0|I like that it comes on my kindle fire but you have to flip through it to the middle letters
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|Rent it instead of buying it. That is my opinion. Hate that Tatum died during the movie sorry if spoiled.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a really good game it could be better if it had more characters to earn then you should have more power ups and more outfits for people and that alien chick.
159463176X|3.0|The story line was good, but I had to reread parts to keep track of everyone.  The part about Abdullah was too chopped up.
B00992CF6W|5.0|So cool I would pay 10 dollars to get you must buy so cooool love it buy it :) good work with the game you should make an update
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a good app but it like temple run and things.other wise it's great. Please get it if you trust my review.
140053271X|5.0|Though I bought the refurbished, it works pretty well and at least there's nothing wrong by now. Actually now we have more choices when choosing a e-book.
B00CXQL828|2.0|The musicianship is great, but wow, that cheese factor is all over the place. The lyrics and the riffs are just recycled (albeit high-quality recycling) from everything else out there. This doesn't sound original at all.<br /><br />BUT - my expectations were probably too high given the talent level in the band.
B006T5GTK0|4.0|So this was of particular interest to me.  I think the TV miniseries has the edge because it go could deeper into the various threads of the story, but this was very good.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This workout is not easy, but it definitely works.  I just started my 3rd round of the 30 Day Shred, and I've lost 56 pounds total.
0439023521|5.0|When I watched the movie version of \\"The Hunger Games\\" I was captivated--and disturbed--by its intense and compelling storyline. And when I found out I could get the book on loan for free on my Kindle through my amazon.com Prime account, I couldn't resist. The book does not disappoint. It is every bit as riveting as the movie. An interesting feature of the book is its first person narrative by the main character, Katniss Everdeen. This approach allows us to see into her head, so to speak, to discern the thoughts and emotions that accompany her actions and interactions.<br /><br />The movie, as it turns out, was very faithful to the book. The harmony between the two was almost seamless. But what was truly delightful about seeing the movie and reading the book is how they added to, and enriched, each other. Book + Movie = 2 + 2 = 5. The book fills in a lot of the background and context of the events in the movie. The book also includes some details that enrich our understanding and appreciation of the characters. The movie, of course, adds a fascinating visual component to the story. Characters from the book literally come to life on the big screen, which in its artistic excellence, draws the viewer into the drama with a sometimes disturbing intensity!<br /><br />The only real difference I saw between the book and the movie was their respective endings. The movie seemed to be more complete in its ending, leaving one with the sense of a satisfying conclusion. The book, on the other hand, masterfully left many loose ends untied--not in a way that left the reader frustrated, but with a desire to read more. And urgently so! The sequel (\\"Catching Fire\\") is now definitely on my \\"must-read\\" list.<br /><br />\\"The Hunger Games.\\" If you have watched the movie, do yourself a favor and read the book. If you have read the book, do yourself a favor and watch the movie. You won't be disappointed.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This sucks hardcore! I don't know what the heck this is, but it's not worth it. I deleted this mess.
B00CL68NOG|1.0|This movie was a total disappointment. Streisand's star power is not enough to get this thing over the hump.  The road trip plot goes nowhere although I have to admit, I did not get all the way through this sleeper.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love it! I hope more levels come soon because I'm addicted now! It kept me entertained but I love puzzles so hurry with more levels
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I've watched all the Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte adaptions. Felt bereaved because there wasn't anything else close to that style that i would want to watch. That i would take interest in. Then , i stumbled upon this cinematic treasure. Emily Blunt was and is absolutely superb in this movie. She embodies everything that is regal while at the same time showing the naivety of the character Queen Victoria; whom had to rule at so young an age. Now, this movie could have gone terribly if they did not cast the perfect person to play Albert. I was pleasantly thrilled with Rupert Friend's performance. He and Mrs. Blunt had great chemistry within the story. It made the love story that much more believable and surreal. It was so concrete.  I loved his portrayal of Prince Albert, particularly when he was showing his frustration and yearning for Queen Victoria's affection.<br /><br />I also enjoyed Paul Bettany's performance. He was great as Melbourne. My favorite scene with him was this one \\" I'm sorry , i can see that i am not making myself clear. You have played the game and lost.\\" That bit, was perfection. Right down to the movement of hands when trying to insert emphasis in the short but oh so perfect speech.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love this game it just doesn't let me buy bombs (and other power ups) like it suppose to ggggg
B004UID2LC|1.0|this used to be my favorite app to download music videos on the go, but today it up all of my tethering data somehow and according to everybody else it sounds like this is full of malware which would answer why it's acting wrong. Too bad I have to install it, it really was a good app
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|I've only had this app for a short time but it is alot of fun shooting the bad guys.  It seemed to take awhile to download but it was worth the wait.  However, I have to say, this app can get mighty expensive and quick, fast and in a hurry.
B008M87GJK|4.0|I prefer BBC to most, if not all, domestic providers.  It's straight up news and that's what this app will bring to your Kindle.
B004478AS4|5.0|It one of the best novels I have read. I was looking for it everywhere and thank God I found.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest? Two words: loveeeeeee it! Pinterest is one of my favorite pasttimes now. You can find almost anything on here! The fashion board is my favorite!
B007X4ECLY|4.0|Guy Pearce made the movie!  His off handed remarks were perfectly delivered for a very funny element in the film.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|You don't expect anything! It's a real thriller with excellent acting. Couldn't stop watching it if I tried! Must see.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was the best book I've read in a long time! I read it in 2 days. It's one of those books where you block out everything else in your world just to read the next page, the next chapter. A beautiful story that I will never forget!
B008JFUR10|5.0|At first I didn't want to see this film, but now I am glad I went this summer.  It works!  Big monsters versus big machines (B-movie), but there is a story and character development that jives well.  Plus the sound and special effects are amazingly entertaining.  This takes the best of Transformers and Godzilla and makes it even better.  Even if you didn't like Transformers or Godzilla, this movie will keep you locked in.  This is on my wish list!  All around entertainment.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Wow, what a cliff-hanger!  This well written book touches on things happening today.  Really good writing and gives the reader a lot to think about.
B007Z9QY1S|3.0|The whole movie should have been  more about Wallis and Edward. It's still a good movie just not what I expected.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, the Blue-Ray combo is a must have.  Lots of extras, good packaging and of course the movies!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this book Can't wait for the next one.  These books always leave me wanting more.  Let's see where the journey takes them.<br /><br />Veronica
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This book resonated so deeply with me. Its like Chimamanda looked into my soul and wrote this book. ... About the strange discontent of life as an African in America but the  sense of not quite belonging in Nigeria either. Chimamanda, thanks for telling our stories!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this chromecast here on Amazon, when it arrived everything looked  good but when I couldn't get it to setup I called google tech support after  about 45 mins of jumping thru the tech support hoops ( by the way I an a computer field/tech support engineer with 40 plus years of experience) was told.<br /> #1. as it did not have serial number as all google sold items did they didn't know what the problem was<br />#2 no it would not work with my Kindle fire HD<br />#3 Some thing must be wrong with my computer it wasn't their hardware or software.<br /><br />Google support a minus 35<br />chomecast packaging  10<br /><br />this is the reason I left chome browser  looks good just doesn't work
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A wonderful calculator app for the Kindle Fire.  Nice big buttons and I like the fact that it shows your last calculation.
0399157565|1.0|Im beginning to think that either Cornwell is really stuck in her formula or she is deliberately painting her character as a narcissistic \\"victim\\" to make Scarpetta as unlikeable as possible.<br />Marino is supposedly \\"obsessed\\" with her (enough to have attempted rape in one of the previous books).<br />Benton is \\"obsessed\\" with her enough to fake his own death to keep her safe.<br />Lucy is \\"obsessed\\" with Scarpetta's safety.<br />And in every single book, the villain becomes obsessed with Scarpetta.<br /><br />Oh, and she cooks and drinks good wine. I mean, these are the things we can come to expect with every single book that has come out in the last 10 years. And it's a shame because Cornwell used to be one of my favorite writers.<br /><br />I feel like this angle of Lucy becoming her own personal Black Ops is just worn out (so much so that she laments in every book about how Lucy does illegal stuff to help keep her safe) and I am just SICK of Marino stupidly falling into love or flirtation with weirdos.<br /><br />This was the last straw for me. I didn't even finish the one previous to this one because I didn't care but wanted to give one last ditch effort. I'm done with Cornwell and I hate that because I feel like she has talent but has just gotten either lazy or bored with her own work. MAke that TWO of us who are bored with her work. :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is really challenging but you don't want to stop til its done! good game for those who like mind games
159514188X|5.0|THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A VERY GOOD BOOK. MY DAUGHTER IS TO READ IT FOR SCHOOL. SHE IS NOW HALF WAY THROUGH READING IT. SO I SUPPOSE IT IS GOOD TO READ.  THANK YOU FOR SENDING IT SO QUICKILY
B005QPMB2Y|5.0|Very easy to use and set up. Looking forward to when Agasio camera's will be added. Thanks for your hard work.
B00005K3OT|5.0|What more can be said.  Juliette Binoche is the lead actress so it will be a good entertaining movie.  Plus it has Johnny Depp.
0780626494|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for and this item is something that fulfills my needs for what I want.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for and this item is something that fulfills my needs for what I want.
B00023BLXK|5.0|This movie that will bring out the dancer in you.  A very enjoyable and entertaining film.  One you can watch with your significant other.
6304698690|5.0|Here is a movie that one cannot stop watching it is a heartwarming story that you will just have to watch without me spoiling it for you by telling you all the details.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Has a few plot holes for time travel but it is just what I was looking for and I enjoyed it as it fulfills my movie watching needs.
6304698623|5.0|Here is another movie that one cannot stop watching it is a heartwarming story that you will just have to watch without me spoiling it for you by telling you all the details.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|A modern telling of the Titanic story.  What more can I say about a gorgeous ship on the wide open Atlantic Ocean with two lovers on board?  I hope I am not giving too much away of the plot but in the end the Titanic sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean struck by an iceberg.
0792844890|4.0|I found it interesting in a funny comedic sort of way and actually enjoyed it but have only seen it one time.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is an enthralling and enjoyable fairy tale movie which was recommended by a friend and they were right as it was very delightful to watch.
B00004RF9G|5.0|What a beautiful love story.  It is just what I was looking for and I enjoyed it immensely as it fulfills my movie watching needs.
0312965788|5.0|Purchased as a gift as his real last name is the same as mine.  It made a good present for my mother.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Good fun, keeps you alert but not aggressive in avoiding solutions. Keeps the grey cells firing. Enjoyment for all ages, great mental gymnastics.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app works great, it gives you a lot of information about your battery state,  charge and information on battery life using different apps. It is very helpful.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Useful app that gives you a lot of information. This app is easy to use and understand. The app has worked great, with no hang ups or glitches.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I look forward to Book Two. As an American, I've learned a lot about the British in that period. But what was most interesting was the background of the political goings-on, and how WWI came about and the specifics there.  I realize that this book is fiction but I feel the overview was quite real.
B005LAII80|5.0|A very entertaining movie. Pretty violent, but that's to be expected for this kind of film. The actors playing the two lead judges did a great job, especially Karl Urban, who had to do all his acting with just the lower half of his face due to a helmet that stayed on for the entire movie. The special effects were great. There are some scenes in slow motion that are kinda beautiful and also relevant to the movie.<br />I thought it was pretty neat how the main story all takes place inside one giant apartment building/city block. You get an up close view of how the people in this world live.  It was nice to see a female lead who wasn't just a damsel in distress. Olivia Thirlby, playing Judge Anderson, really toughens up as the movie progresses and kicks some serious ass. And Judge Dredd is just a complete badass. He isn't saving the world in this movie, he's just doing his job which on this day happens to entail warring with a drug ring and killing dozens of bad guys.<br />So overall, it is a very well made movie, with actors who really fit the bill, and a story that accomplishes exactly what it set out to do.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is a very entertaining movie that is fun for people of all ages. I think kids will like the alien creatures and super hero-like John Carter. And adults will like that it has a complete plot that isn't dumbed down. There is some violence and some slightly skimpy costumes but nothing offensive. It is a Disney movie after all. It's the kind of movie that leaves you with a grin on your face. Everything is well done. The special effects are amazing. There are funny moments and epic battles. When I finished watching it, I didn't want it to end. I wanted to see what happened next.
B007IJDXFK|5.0|This is, simply put, a beautiful album. At times it sounds to me like something Steven Wilson would have done.  If you appreciate good, heartfelt music, do yourself a favor and add this to your collection.
B004WGGQPQ|3.0|This could be a sweet app for crafters, even as is. The grid background could be laboriously filled in, square by square, with a stylus. But it's merely a background choice, there's no one-touch color fill function, nor even a way to draw straight lines. At least the grid is bigger than 20 x 20!  Paint markers are wider but with fewer colors, whereas colored pencils hold true to their small paper contact but have decent color spectrum choices.  It's got UNDO, I think you can SAVE and RESUME, although I haven't tried that.  There are decals if you want to use them, but this is not a pre- designed coloring book or game or puzzle, nor is it pre<br />-programmed to spread color repeats across the page, nor does it force you to register for sharing on a social network.  My Kindle Fire can handle it just fine, but for now it will have to remain on the Cloud. I can continue to do my design work on the PC.  Some day soon I hope to be able to use the wonderful convenience of the tablet away from home and offline for the type of grid designing I do.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is the &#34;Best Superhero Movie Yet!&#34; It really is. Hulk makes this movie, but all the characters play off each other and make this possibly one of the best movies ever made. I loved it. Well worth your time and money.
B005LAIGOQ|3.0|I got this movie for my daughter who loved it when we rented it. It was just okay to me. It's well acted but the story just didn't hold my interest and the scary factor was just okay. I sit through it thinking &#34;Really?&#34;
1423140605|5.0|Rick Riordan is creative in his recreation of the mythical. Brilliantly bringing the Gods from the Roman and the Greek mythology and pitting the Heroes against each other. This is very entertaining. The entire series is worth the read and I would rate each book with the same 5 stars. Read them all!
B0084IG7KC|4.0|They really did well at making this movie. The characters were played well and for a movie made from book was done very well. You will like this movie, but if you haven't read the book get to it.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I had 50 gru thingys than I hit a rocket thingy and lost all of my gru thingys but it is a fun game I guess
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fast paced and exciting.  I'm excited to read two. I was surprised I enjoyed the book as much as I did since I had already seen the movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|watched a teen play and had to get it myself. very fun! anyone can play! the hints are a little confusing because you don't know they're only so many per round.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|The app worked well, even the first time.  It was easy to understand and get up and running.  The only thing I had to work on was learning that each time I set an alarm I needed to also set what volume I wanted for the alarm.<br /><br />It has enough choices for clock display, alarm ring, and a few other little options.<br /><br />I'd recommend this app to friends, especially considering the price.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I 100% recommend you get this app because its constantly being updated and is just well, great I also recommend that you get the computer version of the game<br />(Besides the price of $30.00)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I spend hours of playing this game and my son just loves it and can't stop playing it either. The Minions are like really little people. I just can't get enough of this game. I play it in the morning and at night before I go to bed.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|the boss is WAY to hard even the easy One took me about 16 minutes to kill and even then I almost died....
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love despicable me, and being a minion in the game is so much fun. The game has frozen a couple of times but that could be my tablet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best game ever love it. I like the fact that is a challenging game not like others which are pretty easy.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I loved this Movie and so did my kids!!! Also loved the way I got this Movie thru Amazon not only cheeper than the stores but convenient!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I was surprised  by the will of the woman to take on a trip like that, it took unbelievable strength.Can hardly wait for our meeting and discussion !
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|What can one say? Any CD by Guy Clark is authentic, honest and from the heart.  It's Guy Clark.  The lyrics and the music are as real as it gets.
B002JI94J4|4.0|I had only seen bits and pieces of this over the years but it has always been something I wished I had seen when it first came out.<br /><br />This was pretty light-weight entertainment but is was nice to see all 4 of the Fab Four alive and interacting on the big screen. The story was not much but it was good to see what, in reality, were the first real music videos. I almost think I would have preferred just to see more footage of them performing than anything else.<br /><br />This was a very nice walk down my personal memory lane!<br /><br />I would rate this 4.0 of 5.0 mostly for the nostalgia value.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Great challenging game...fun and very very addictive. A bit confusing at first, however after 3 or 4 games you learn it.
B006ZDS7CE|4.0|I dismissed her at first and then i finally, actually gave her a shot. She crafts song with a classic pop structure but a true twenty first century sound. Secondly, it's \\"girlfriend friendly\\", which is always a plus for me.
B009AMANBA|5.0|I felt like I had just met Abe Lincoln!! This is a superb movie showing what probably happened historically to our 16th President.
B0016CVN02|5.0|&#34;Minight Rambler&#34; is about as creepy as it gets and the brilliance by inserting certain musical instruments in just the right places  makes this great tune a excellent listen.  None of that Zombie, chilling nonsense written just to scare you for frightening's sake, But a real piece of work that reminds us, locking the suburbia doors at night is a splendid idea.  That's what makes it so good.  Keep listening from side one track one, all the way to &#34;Wild Horses.&#34;  Feel everything from the sweat, pain, truth, beauty, and passion of one who is not going to denied his Woman.  Love is the major theme thruought this collection.  OK, so &#34;Sympathy for the Devil&#34; didn't please my Pastor in the least.  I don't think he got it.  The others, and especially, &#34;You can't always get What You Want&#34; will last well unto forever.  Using the Boy's Choir in the beginning and climaxing with Jagger belting out the lyrics while the piano is playing a little finalizing medley is again, nothing short of brilliance.  Play it very loud, and sing along.  No one will hear the off-tune singing while you're busily embracing and being wrapped up by the song.  And for us air guitar afficiandos, &#34;Street Fighting Man&#34; will get any 60+ years old guys pumpin', even if you can get your country and western heads outta their recliners.  The lyrics of any tune were diligently written for the right person, and Jagger absolutely nailed it every time.  Rock on!
B007REV4T8|5.0|Who knew they would kill off &#34;M&#34; ??  I didn't see that coming - I really didn't!  I love this movie - the third of Daniel Craig.  He's a good all around James Bond man.
B0018ARNME|5.0|Neil Young would later dismiss some of his work stemming from the &#34;Hippie Days&#34; but it was all important to me.  And really, to him, too.  Who else would care enough to seek that grinding sound for a song?  (Answer: he learned, I believe, from a member of Crazy Horse who told him to switch a bulb or two in the Amp)  No doubt it worked and most songs sounded like the were produced in a garage.  Cool.  Neil Young hits and drives it hard either with love in Cowgirl in the Sand or with his best, Cinnamon Girl.  Frankly, I hated Ohio because I despised what happened.  He just sang a song about it, that's all.  The Needle and the Damage Done would strike close to home and Rockin' in the Free World smashed the joint.  The land of the free, home of the brave stuff can be really painful if the people in charge don't care if you're nothing more than a bump in the road.  But those of us can, are still rockin' and it's the music that keeps us going.  I was 22 when I first heard &#34;Old Man.&#34;  41 years later.  It's a great song to sing along with.  Thanks for it all, Neil.
B0002TJGQS|4.0|They deliver three times the service life over those No-Name brand batteries<br />that I had previously used. The price was reasonable for Lithium Batteries.
0345525558|5.0|My sister recommended this book to me and I loved it. Read it pretty much straight through. Easy read, gets your emotions going.<br />Definitely recommend it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini's novels always open my understanding of that troubled part of the world. It was a little hard to read because each section was the whole story of some individual. It didn't always feel like it hung together.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Bought as a gift for my son and he loved it.  Can't find thus season in the stores, they are always out.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|After visiting Guernsey Island and seeing the remains of the German bunkers, it was easy to picture all of the story. The people Seemed quaint but very real.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I saw him on a late night show and was not sure whether or not I liked him, but it grew on me; heard it at work and realized I liked it a lot and finally found it after Binging a bunch of half lines form his song
B001L83PLQ|5.0|This novel was very intense but I couldn't put it down. An eye-opener about the effect of war on even the educated middle class. No one is untouched.
B000002OTK|5.0|Do not have VHS hooked up at the moment. I watched on Prime. I bought the DVD afterward. This is Tarantino at his best!<br />I like him, but this says so much, with out shoving down your throat. Which I think he later stuff has a tendency to do.<br />Travolta is amazing in this. The dance scene is worth it alone. Subtle.
B001BANK32|5.0|The story line keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The characters are relateable and interesting.  Nobody can weave a story quite like Stephen King. His underlying themes and plot twists are riveting. I cannot wait to read his sequel.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|When I first heard about this, I was pretty excited. I wasn't sure if it would do exactly what I wanted, but for $35, I was willing to try it out. I got it yesterday and set it up on a Samsung Galaxy Note tablet. I didn't realize from the ads that it required a separate power supply. Fortunately, my TV has a USB port that I could plug it into. I would have hated to have another device to plug into the power strip. However, having it plugged in to the USB port means that it can't turn on the TV when the TV is turned off (like they do in the ads).<br /><br />It was nice being able to see Youtube videos on TV, but I generally don't spend much time only watching Youtube videos (I'm usually checking my e-mail or browsing the web at the same time) and I don't use Netflix or buy anything through GooglePlay, so Youtube was basically all I could use it for. Even with that, I feel like if you have a decent sized computer screen, there really isn't any point in trying to watch a short Youtube video on a large TV. Also, I don't like the fact that I have to use GoogleChrome to use the device. You can also get Netflix, Youtube and other applications through a SmartTV or a blu-ray player with Wi-Fi, so if you have either of those, there really isn't any point in using this device.<br /><br />I think it's nice for the novelty, but like someone else said in another review, it's basically just a \\"Youtube player\\". Ultimately, I think it would be better to shell out a hundred or so bucks and get an HDMI video transmitter and then be able to see whatever you want from your computer on your TV screen.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Brings back some old memories from one of my all time favorite games. Once I started I just couldn't put it down. Love it!  If you like simple yet addictive games this is for you!
B009LK6JS2|5.0|This game is awesome! You start out with 4 different planes and the only thing (other than the game itself) you would want to buy would be a 5th plane.<br />This game is a great time waster. You can either do missions using any of the planes on either of the 2 (detailed) maps or do a rectangle competition, carrier landing, airbase landing, landing competition,  or freeflight taking off of the carrier or airbase.<br />Realistic controls, well responding, and all together, a fun game. Buy!  Its more than worth 2 dollars!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This has some of Garth's best songs.  I truly enjoy this CD.  Would recommend it to anyone that enjoys country music.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All 3.  Batman fan?  You need this.  I'm ready to see how it's gonna get rebooted, but I doubt anyone will ever top this trilogy.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is fun and easy to play. My 7 year old loves it. I only have one problem, the in app buy push and the FaceBook push. My little one loves the game but wants me to open the levels. Not easy when they want you to buy game points.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I purchased this app for my daughter when she became a big sister so she could play while I feed the baby. It entertains her for hours!
B00328G4V6|5.0|If you are a Hendrix fan, buy this! New songs and other versions of prior recordings. Jimi's version of Cream's Sunshine is truly spectacular!!!!!
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I enjoy this game and the challenge it provides. the 3-D effects add a cool new dimension to typical &#34;tetris&#34; like games. However, it doesn't save your level when you quit, so you have to start over every time you reopen the game.
B000V1Z8KK|1.0|Plenty for you conspiracy theory buffs: lots of shooting up and black helicopters chasing the hero. Acting is good, but the story line suffers from conspiracy theory over-patronization. It never explained why they needed the main character if they wanted to assassinate the president. Setting him up as a fall guy got too complex to be believable. Why didn't they just shoot the president and be done with it? But the most irritating thing about this movie is the dialog: everybody is always whispering, and it was difficult to understand what they were saying. Turning up the volume didn't help because the background sinister sound effects got louder along with the voices. I thought my hearing was going, but in several scenes there was a TV monitor with a simulated newscast that was perfectly understandable.<br /><br />If it is on TV, you might try it before you buy it.
B006ANJ4BW|3.0|From the reviews and word-of-mouth I found about this version of Conan, I was expecting an awful movie adaption that not only ripped apart REH's character, but made the second Arnold movie look like Citizen Kane.  I am happy to report that this movie is not bad, not a grand piece, but it has quiet a few moments when it shines.  The movie does have its downsides, mainly almost no character depth outside of Conan and his father, and the cartoony main villain.  I do like the origin part of the movie, it seemed more realistic while still staying epic, a little insight into Conan's childhood and the double tragedies of his parents' deaths that shaped his adulthood.  Ron Perlman as Conan's father was terrific, just enough emotion and subtlety to show that he loved his son dearly and worked hard to make Conan a man that could one day be a noble and just warrior.  The idea of Conan being born literally in the heat of battle was a nice touch as well.  I am disappointed that no sequels from this version of Conan are being considered, this movie was a good starting point that promised a franchise with a bit more flavor than the Arnold movies.
B007KQ6XYY|3.0|I gave it a 3 because I like the original better, some things are better off left alone. i would tell others about it but I would leave the decision up to them
B0014JGDUC|4.0|after only a week the bottom no-slip grips was peeling off. had to super glue it back together. other than that they are very comfortable.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I love this. It reminds me of the Fleming Bottle and Jug cutter I had for years. SImular construction, easy to use .
B000SEGUDE|4.0|There's no way to to describe what the book is about - the rise and fall of our history and potential future. Looking at it that way can make the decisions we make as a society rather frightening. But taken by themselves as just stories made the whole book fascinating. Loved the different writing styles for each chapter but I sometimes wished it was a bit easier to pull it all together to see the common thread. I would definitely read mire by David Mitchell. Preferred the book over the movie but I'm glad I saw the movie first for once.
B001TH16DI|5.0|If you love these moves and don't already have them then they are a must buy!  They did a fantastic job on the restoration and I hope they can do this good with other older movies!

B00C0W08XK|5.0|I love sudoku and this app works great. I've had no problems so far with it. All around good app! If you're addicted to this game like I am, you'll never want to put it down!
B0088W6LAK|5.0|This is going to be a biased review. I love Stargate. It is the only reason I have an Amazon Prime subscription. If you do not like Stargate you will not like this show.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I like it for very light use. I'm a techie who don't watch TV. My TV fires up less than a dozen times a year, for some football games and state of the union address since I got it in 2004. I definitely don't pay for TV, whether it's cable, satellite, Hulu, Netflix. Doesn't matter.<br /><br />This thing is well designed, very easy to setup without any instructions. But then again, I almost never read instructions. I put on hours of youtube documentaries while I'm doing things around the living room, and it works well for this purpose.<br /><br />I even read some ebooks on Amazon cloud player with it. There's a few second lag for page turns but it's nice to read ebooks on large screens while sitting confortably.<br /><br />It also gives me an excuse to keep my old tablet - the HTC flyer as a remote control for it.<br /><br />It actually does a decent job streaming online content in X264. But then again, I'm not glued to the TV; I use it as a background radio when I'm doing chores. So far, I'm happy with it. Not a lot of bugs, and that's amazing because I usually catch a lot of bugs playing with gadgets.<br /><br />And I'm definitely replacing my old popcorn hour with it. Let's face it, navigation on TV is painful, and that's what this Chromecast is all about.<br /><br />for $35, with a 3 month netflix coupon, not having to glue myself to the TV, I'm pretty happy with it.<br /><br />(I'm not happy with Amazon dragging its feet on the netflix coupon, though.)
0393317552|5.0|This book is key to understanding today's racist prison system. About 13 percent of Americans are black. In the U.S. in 2008, black men were six times more likely to be in prison than white men.

B007EC27QM|5.0|This is an easy to use calculator for basic math problems.  I use this a lot for figuring tax &amp; tips when eating out at local restaurants.  Being able to double check your entries in the history is a helpful feature for me, because I occasionally transpose digits and this makes it easy to double check my entries. Aside from games, this is one of my most frequently used apps.
B00ADS98FC|2.0|The movie is wonderful, but the viewing device was not what I had hoped for. I downloaded the movie onto my iPad hoping to be able to view on a TV via an HDMI cable hookup, only to find that it was not able to do so through the Amazon app on my iPad. Very sad evening for my grandkids, as we were at a hotel and they were really looking forward to watching this movie.
B00574P9EQ|5.0|Watched this with my 9 and 7 year olds.  They loved it even though they may be a little young for some of the humor.  Only lasting negative repercussion was a day of them calling one another &#34;Butt Brain.&#34;  Fortunately it only lasted a day.
B005D0RDKC|1.0|The worst Johnny Cash I've heard, and I'm a fan since the 50's. Just a bunch of live recordings p with poor acoustics. If your a JC fan, you don't need this.

B00881VLCE|5.0|Great but would have liked to have more pictures to do.  I enjoy wildlife, scenic and nature puzzles.  I download a lot of puzzles for my Kindle fire and the wildlife and scenic pictures are a lot of fun.  Where there are different selections (like number of pieces, turn pieces, etc.) you can drive yourself crazy with all the challenge you can give yourself.  This one is right in there.

It is somewhat humorous, but the cussing is overboard and not as necessary as the Coen Brothers think<br />it had to be.  Sam Elliott said it best, and was one of the brighter spots in this movie.

B0087ZG7NO|5.0|I'm sorry, but anything that Steven Spielberg is responsible for, has to be nothing short of GRAND!  This scenario will be acted out either in the near future(my lifetime +/- 30 yrs) or our children's lifetime(+/- 90 yrs).  Given the current scientific genetic knowledge, there is no reason not too.  Like this film's theme, we have to become a more responsible care-taker, in order not to have such disasters to occur.  This film has to rate in the very upper 10% of all motion pictures.  Please, do not miss this one and the one previous as they are pure entertainment.  (WE ARE BUT CARETAKERS OF THIS WORLD; THEREFORE, WE MUST DO OUR VERY BEST SEE THAT EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IS DONE TO PROTECT IT AND ITS INHABITANTS!)  NJMJr!

B000059XUP|5.0|It has taken three(3) tries for me to understand the true meaning of this film.  Humans can be such shallow animanls and that includes yours truly.  The vast majority of reviewers have trashed this film and even the series of films, as being irreverent and even sacrilegious toward Judeo-Christain relegions.  The inclusion of the 'Day of the Dead' in this story line should gives the mind, an astronomical amount of answers as for the meaning of this production.  The human animal has developed a very short memory during its evolution, as to the meaning of life and all of its associated struggles.  The end of this movie sums up its very esscence:  SOMETIMES IT TAKES A CROW TO SHOW THAT LOVE IS THE PATHWAY TO LIFE!  NJMJr!

0440246008|4.0|Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher? I guess I'll have to see the film, because tiny Tom playing a 6 foot 5 inch, 250 pound boulder of an ex-Army CID MP seems like a Hollywood cartoon. To cast Jack Reacher you need an actor the size of The Rock with the attitude of Lee Marvin in \\"The Professionals\\" or \\"Point Blank\\"--lethal and remorseless. But the movie being out there got me to read the novels, just like movies got me reading Michael Connelly--must be a pretty good story and characters. And Lee Child delivers those in \\"The Hard Way,\\" and in all his Jack Reacher books I've read (\\"Without Fail,\\" \\"Die Trying,\\" \\"The Killing Floor,\\" \\"Tripwire,\\" \\"Echo Burning\\").<br />Reacher wanders, toothbrush in pocket, the clothes on his back, maybe an old passport in his pocket, maybe no identification at all. No visible means of support until he wires himself something through Western Union. He's off the grid and claims to like it that way. But trouble ALWAYS finds Reacher in the first chapter and he's off and running, saving good guys, rescuing damsels, and offing bad guys. And nobody can off bad guys as efficiently as Reacher; a regular Great White among man killers. Not many equals as a man hunter either. But lethality with multiple side orders of mayhem are Reacher's true skill set.<br />An ex-SAS mercenary interrupts Reacher's espresso at a Manhattan sidewalk cafe and delivers him to Lane, head of an elite Blackwater-like mercs-for-hire outfit, with $21 million in an apartment vault. Reacher apparently witnessed a kidnapper picking up the ransom for Lane's wife, and latter we learn, step-daughter. So naturally, Jack joins the quest to get back the super-model wife and daughter. But nothing is ever that simple in a Jack Reacher tale.<br />This tale deals up good portions of Manhattan sleuthing, the usual colorful characters Reacher seems to attract, evil incarnate bad guys, and less-than-normal levels of mayhem and violence until the end, when Jack takes out ... well, just leave it that Jack's head count at the end does not disappoint, and he buries the evil-doers where the sun don't shine.<br />All of Lee Child's plots are different but the same--impossible situations that go so wrong only Jack Reacher (and usually an exceptionally capable and beautiful female sidekick) could possibly set things to rights in a slam-bang finale.<br />Reacher has some other special talents that make him more interesting than the average tough-fisted gumshoe and make this series above average: Jack's internal clock that's more accurate than your wrist watch and very useful at work; a knack for finding, trusting, and respecting competent female professionals; a real feel for sleuthing; and a blind spot that lets Lee Child surprise us just a little bit. The author lets us get a jump on Reacher and see what's coming a chapter or two before the light dawns on the big guy. Just enough ahead of him so that Reacher doesn't make us feel totally inadequate and inferior. But Reacher eventually works it out, and his talents for creative and innovative bloodshed kick in, he saves the damsel(s), saves the day, and usually saves a fair chunk of boodle, or else racks up tons of good will with the Powers That Be. Reacher (and his creator) always make it up to us for the big guy's mental clock being just a tad slower than ours at the end.<br />And then Jack Reacher wanders on to another espresso and random adventure, and we can't wait to pick up the next installment.<br />Tom Cruise? I guess I'll have to see the movie.Jack's head count at the end does not disappoint, and he buries the evil-doers where the sun don't shine.<br />All of Lee Child's plots are different but the same--impossible situations that go so wrong only Jack Reacher (and usually an exceptionally capable and beautiful female sidekick) could possibly set things to rights in a slam-bang finale.<br />Reacher has some other special talents that make him more interesting than the average tough-fisted gumshoe and make this series above average: Jack's internal clock that's more accurate than your wrist watch and very useful at work; a knack for finding, trusting, and respecting competent female professionals; a real feel for sleuthing; and a blind spot that lets Lee Child surprise us just a little bit.

B004WJV6OY|5.0|Finally watched this while flying over the western US, which makes a good backdrop for Ed's music. If you have a remote interest in Pearl Jam or Eddie Vedder, buy this. If you like the PJ song, Arc, you're in for a bigger treat. Ed's version of Arc on this DVD pushes the song into a layered prayer, a hymn. It's worth the price of the DVD and then some. Now...Ed, please release these audio files as a standalone soundtrack. Please...

B0027MJU00|5.0|I won't waste your time with another summary of the story. Instead, I will give you my impressions of the book from the view point of an avid reader for more years than i wish to admit. After reading this latest Gillian Flynn book, I would rank her among some of the best to include John Le Carrie,<br /><br />This author has the rare ability to bring to life characters and surroundings that will remain with you well after you have finished the book. I don't know people like the family in this book, but I felt as if they were the people next door.<br />.<br />This is the best book yet from Flynn. Her first book was good, second was better and this one puts her right up there with the best writers.  The story was well thought out and has a surprise ending. I highly recommend it. I can't wait to read whatever she has planned for the future. Bravo, Gillian

0062059882|4.0|As I worked my way through this novel (and sometimes it was work), I was never sure if I liked it or not.  I now understand why it's difficult to classify. I truly have not read anything like American Gods before.  When I finally reached the end, I decided I did like it. But I still won't be reading the sequel.<br /><br />I can usually read a book in a few days, but this one took me weeks.  The main crux is that not a lot happens. The protagonist Shadow travels the country with the enigmatic Wednesday, encountering strange people, strange gods, and getting into the occasional trouble.  For the first half of the book, the reader will probably be as confused as Shadow.  We hear a lot about coin tricks, the story is broken by italicized incidents of characters/gods first coming to America that have no impact on Shadow or his journey, and the only person we get to know at all is Shadow. And he is very reactive; things happen to him.  And there appears to be no underlying plot - until the very end when stray threads, widely spread throughout the book, finally form a pattern.  The ending was very clever, and perfect for the story, but also vaguely unsatisfying.<br /><br />I don't want to sound like this isn't a good book. It is, but it is far from a typical book. The premise is amazing: all the gods, from all the diverse peoples who have come to America, are all here. That those gods are fading away because their people no longer believe is remarkable and had me returning to the book again and again.  It was fun trying to decipher which character was which god because Gaiman doesn't just hand you the famous names. You have to pay attention. Gaiman's writing is beautiful.  His descriptions bring America, particularly small-town America, to vivid life.<br /><br />This book is not for everyone, but for those looking for something unique, this book is something special. Also, I think perhaps editors are more vital than we know. I think I may have enjoyed the original version more than the author's \\"preferred text.\\"  Overall, I would recommend it, but less patient readers might want to read the original edition. I won't be reading Anansi Boys, but I will definitely be reading more from Neil Gaiman.more than the author's \\"preferred text.\\"  Overall, I would recommend it, but less patient readers might want to read the original edition.

B000UAFDP2|5.0|A shame this film didn't do well in the box office, but not surprising, given it opted to run with a cast of mostly unknown commodities. In fact, its biggest name at the time was Doogie Howser (Neil Patrick Harris), and he wasn't even the lead in the film. But I do have to say I enjoyed the performances of two of its cast, Casper Van Dien, who played the lead, and Dina Meyer, one of his love interests in the story. And a enjoyable appearance from Clancy Brown (Highlander) must also be mentioned.<br /><br />The film had all of the ingredients of a good time at the movies, at least for me anyway: Plenty of action, bullets, explosions, good comedic moments, and fantastic special effects. A space opera in all of its glory! Past all the big starships, large-scale battles, and big explosions... On a deeper level, I loved that it all centered at its core: That this story was clearly poking fun at military propaganda. And while that doesn't mean that I advocate such thoughts, I just find that most of the big, blockbuster type films that I watch and especially enjoy, usually have one thing in common... A core focal point that drives the movie. For example, the first Transformers movie's focus was \\"A kid and his first car\\". This, was making light of military propaganda media. Whatever it may be, it tends to drive these movies a little better and makes them more enjoyable (again, at least for me), and you know as well as I do... There are a plenty of movies out there, especially the big blockbusters, that are simply mindless action vehicles. And then again, and I'll admit it... I like a lot of those too. Hey, what can I say? Heh. As an aside, this film was based on novel by Robert A. Heinlein... I wonder if the jestering of military propaganda was a carried-over focal point from the novel or not. Definitely a book I'd have to look into for comparison sake.<br /><br />Anyway, I felt Starship Troopers was a thrilling adventure to take in. And if you're into grand, space operas and big action flicks, and have never seen this... Then I'd say give it a try. I've had several friends who've never watched or even heard of this movie that I showed it to and they came away surprised at how awesomely fun it was and wondered why they never noticed it before. Have a good time and give it a watch.
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|The fact that her pet is a bunny makes her one of my favorites :-) Love her details, outfit and story.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Tangled is a fun movie to watch, regardless of your age.  The script catches your interest and keeps you occupied.  I recommend this movie for a family gathering.  Jesus' Blessings and Peace
B00CELB94E|5.0|BE, the latest release from the former members of Oasis ranks as one of the finest efforts in their entire careers. Less of a follow-up to &#34;Different Gear, Still Speeding&#34;, BE is an acoustic based psychedelic sonic festival with fantastic material to boot. Thanks in part to a co-production by Dave Sitek, BE is leaps & bounds sonically over it's predecessor with an almost organic feel which is sorely missing in pop music these days.
B005PK57NU|5.0|This is a fantastic how with great writing and every character is extremely interesting, not just the main few. Watch!
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Passion.  As I read, I experience.  The book takes you into it..it's  crazy great and never dull or slow or dragging. I'm attached to the characters the thrills and trials are triumphed by lovers that fight for there togetherness and trying to balance there differences and balance the good and darkness within themselves using the good and harness the darkness for energy to prevail over evil in the name of love and passion.

B00B4804KS|5.0|I bought this hoping the 3D would be done well and I was not disappointed.  This was already one of my favorite movies and I think it even better in 3D.  I would like to see the other two films in the series remastered and released in 3D.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved how silly and entertaining this was! I would recommend this book to anyone! If you want a book that keeps you laughing, this is the book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Hilariously funny movie. Unique characters deliver a marvelous dialog good for young and old alike .Buy this for everyone! A great big laugh is good for you
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loved The Red Pyramid. It was a great book and captivated me from the very beginning. I appreciated the fact that it was appropriate for children such as myself, and I would recommend it for children ages 9 and up. It is a little intense and violent in some parts of the book, but otherwise it is my favorite book ever.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Got hooked since first episode of season 1. We all can't wait for season 4 to start. Lets see how well Paul Giamatti blends in the show as Cora's Brother.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game but the Facebook goals are a little annoying. I don't leave posts about any of the games I play on Facebook so I won't do it for this game either. Building your own city is fun. I also wish it was easier tomorrow's and such.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Love always has a way of sneaking up on you when you are least expecting it!
B000BNX4MC|5.0|This is a great movie.  If you have not seen it yet, take time out to enjoy yourself and get away from it all.
B00DF0POXA|5.0|This album is epic; It's genius; And the production is ahead of it's time. What we're listening to is an artist ripping off his own skin and telling you exactly who he is warts and all.The bravery that West exhibits on this album is to be commended! If you're offended, and your PC sensibilities got ruffled and think he's irresponsible, even better! Undoubtedly the best Kanye joint ever released and if you don't like it you're simply clueless.
B008LY9AWG|4.0|While I am not a particular fan of short stories, these are well written and leave you wanting more.  Connelly at his high standards.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|i downloaded the app and it was open i waited and then when i got caught it just started loading ahain and FYI that loading took about four min
1608871827|5.0|This book is packed full of extras and the art is spectacular. This is a great book for any fan of the movie.
B001N9ESQ4|4.0|If you are tired of American movies where the only attraction are the bullets, this movie is a good option. It also not a cheesy-funny movie (like the American movies that are not all about gunshots). This is more real life. Also, if you like traveling, you might find yourself pictured in the characters.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I LOVED \\"Gone Girl\\" ... So I think my expectations were a little high, even though Gillian delivered, I found the story of Gone Girl just a wee but more captivating but Sharp Objects was awesome!!!! Highly recommended!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|better than the movie and i really liked the movie too ! this book is unique in its own words
B001VI5MMG|5.0|The DVD The Saint arrived arrived in a timely manner, was in great condition, I viewed it in it's entirety, and am very satisfied with my order and receipt of the merchandise.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I think that the PR company for this writer should get their money back.  The book was a horror.  Terribly disappointed in it from the very beginning.  Not a fantasy romance, nor a explicit sexy novel series, but like a high school student writing.... I did not recommend it to anyone.  I give it a terrible review.  Wasted time.  e
B00594XOZU|1.0|I got this app, and it won't work.  It will say it's downloading but it won't download!!!  So I gave up on it and never came back to it!!!!!  So PLEASE be careful of what buy from here!!!!!!!!!!  I got it because I was hopping it would work, but nope it did not work.  So PLEASE read other peoples reviews to see what they say about an item they brought from Amazon!!!!!  Thanks!!

B005HSL626|5.0|I spend a lot of time playing this game, its a really great game and its addictive, I recommend this game for everyone, all ages
B004WMKSH2|1.0|Couldn't watch it. Couldn't view it directly. Download would have taken 3 hours. Should have rented from Apple. You'd think I would have learned after all the trouble I had with Kindle Fire! Will never rent another video from Amazon. Wasted $1.99 and an hour of my time.
B00006674X|5.0|My daughter loves it.  This movie met all of our expectations-arrived on time and was in excellent condition as stated.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It needs more time also I think you should be able to have a dog I also think that you should be able to activate community content
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is fantastic!! The characters really suck you in. I just watched seasons 1 & 2 as well. The actors are fantastic as well. Truly enjoyable.  Can't wait for season 4.
B00068TJM6|5.0|A fine working watch , Good looks and all of the bells a watch should have would recomend it to my son
B005AVIZ6U|4.0|In this book `The Affair', Lee Childs takes us back to 1997 when Jack Reacher was still a major in the military police. After a woman has her throat cut in an outback Mississippi town that has an economy that relies on a nearby army base, Jack Reacher is sent in undercover. No one is sure whether the murderer is a soldier or a local person. There are a number of interesting characters in the book, which includes the beautiful Elizabeth Deveraux, the county sheriff who used to be a US marine and Major Munro who is also an MP and the main investigating officer for the murder. As usual with the Jack Reacher series, nothing is as it seems. The Jack Reacher books always have a level of descriptive detail that is not usually found in other crime thrillers. Despite this, they are fast paced and keep you turning the pages. There are sub-plots, dead-ends and everything else that is required for an entertaining thriller. Lee Childs has found a winning formula and this is the sixtieth book in the series. However, it is no good having a winning formula unless you can keep every book fresh with surprise twists and Lee Childs can certainly do that.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This app gives me something to do to pass the time.  There is not a whole lot to complain about...except the credits run out too quickly!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This is written by a Muslim, looking at Christians beliefs from their point of view. He is not a historian. This book is his opinion, only. It is not fact.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game! But it should update more often on the kindle because i notice on the kindle it is version 0.7.1 while on the ipad it is 0.7.2!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|If you want to read a romance without all the details and enjoy it, this is the book for you.  I can hardly wait for book 3 to be released.  Who will she pick?
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I am a big fan of many of the HBO series': The Sopranos, Rome, especially The Wire.  With this series, NetFlix has shown the same quality, and that kind of competition is good for all of us.
0765334798|4.0|I was going to say that this book's premise is silly, derivative and executed poorly.  I was going to say that this was the worst book John Scalzi has ever written, and that I was giving it two stars simply out of my respect for his other works.<br /><br />Then I read the three codas that follow the main story.<br /><br />And now I say that, while the presentation is definitely unconventional, Scalzi has something to say to us about how to live our lives, and it's worth listening to.  The real meat is in the codas, as you may have guessed, but to understand them you have to read the main body.  I will warn you that you have to exercise some patience and be prepared to use your brain a little.<br /><br />If that isn't what you're looking for, I recommend you forego Redshirts.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Talk about a highly anticipated album! Black Sabbath's nineteenth full-length studio album (!) is their first collection of new material in over eighteen years, and their very first to feature original frontman Ozzy Osbourne, who rejoined the band after getting fired from it in 1979 (!!). That's right, although it is not exactly a little-known fact, 2013's \\"13\\" this is the first Sabbath recording to feature Ozzy behind the mic in over thirty-four whole friggin' years.<br /><br />As a result, \\"13\\" defines what it means for a band to return to studded form, and just when you thought they never would, too! Indeed, with the exception of Bill Ward (who sat this one out due to recording contract disputes), all of the group's original members were called on for this album: Osbourne, guitarist Tony Iommi, and bassist Geezer Butler. And Ex-Rage Against The Machine and Audioslave drummer Brad Wilk, who (of all people) was hired to fill in for Ward, does a very sufficient job at filling in his shoes. (In fact, you might not even notice that Ward is missing!) So how fitting it is, then, for it to sound like a return to Sabbath's early days -- the \\"Black Sabbath\\"-to-\\"Masters Of Reality\\" period. (\\"13\\" is much heavier and less experimental than most of the stuff that Iommi and Co. have released since the 1970's.)<br /><br />The record also perfectly encapsulates the sound of a band that is truly firing on all cylinders. Sure, Iommi might be the major key behind the maelstrom, dominating it with some of his all-time finest guitar riffs and solos. (And plus, even though like a zillion Sabbath clones bands have outright thefted Iommi's guitar work, it somehow still manages to sound astonishingly original, here.) But the rest of the group sounds at the top of their respective games, as well. While Butler might not be as important as he was on, say, 1970's \\"Paranoid\\" has a definite place in the music, too, because it just would not be complete without his ominous bass grumbling along in the background. And, of course, any review of \\"13\\" would be strangely incomplete without mentioning the performance given by the Ozz-man. It is a remarkable one, let me tell ya -- his voice sounds as strong as ever as it wails away atop the mountains of profusely rocking metal rhythms. And his lyrics are also quite good -- they are exceptionally profound, lucid, powerful, clever, and memorable.<br /><br />The album opens on a positively air-guitar-able note, as \\"End Of The Beginning\\" boasts a foreboding, lumbering, doom laden guitar lick and two terrific solos: The first of which being a blistering, unorthodoxly shredding, whammy-bar-soaked solo; and the second is substantially more melodic and involved, but not any less excellent. (The latter of the two also sounds somewhat bluesy at times.) And this tune, which eventually switches to a slightly faster chug, is over eight whole minutes long, but the record's next track, \\"God Is Dead?,\\" is even longer and more epic. Its intro occupied by dreamy acoustic strumming, but the song then abruptly switches gears, becoming heavy and aggressive at around the thirty-three second mark. It switches back to proggy acoustic territory for its verses before switching back one more time to heavy, electric guitar-driven sections. And as a result of these really meaty, pounding, densely churning, and bottom-heavy guitar/bass riffs, \\"God Is Dead\\"'s choruses are made into really huge and really, really memorable ones. And at around six-and-a-half minutes in, there's another tempo/arrangement change-up, this one taking the song into more up-tempo territory. As such, the listener might be misled to believe this signifies the start of a new song -- but it doesn't. It is all the same song -- and a terrifically epic one at that, as it clocks in at roughly nine minutes in total length. (And that it retains its catchy vocal patterns, memorable lyrics, and unforgettable choruses are proof of this fact, as is the fact that there are solid, muscularly humming bass lines throughout.)<br /><br />I could spend all day talking about those two tracks alone, but I won't, because there are plenty of other killer cuts to be found on \\"13.\\" So, let's move along, shall we? \\"Loner\\" boasts an uber-chunky, headbangable (and thus instantly memorable) main riff accented by some fiery, crunching guitar licks and exceptional soloing. The set's first curveball does not come until track four: \\"Zeitgeist\\" is a power ballad through and through, and even though it is only four-and-a-half minutes in length, it is still a friggin' epic! It begins with some of Ozzy's now patented (and world-renowned) maniacal laughter before trafficking in some ethereal acoustic guitar strums and soft, \\"Planet Caravan\\"-approved tribal beats. (Wilk lays down some of his most interesting fills in this song, although the rest of Black Sabbath's rhythm section is also noteworthy, here, too, as there are some melodically moaning bass notes permeating throughout it.) And the icing on \\"Zeitgeist\\"'s already decadently sweet cake comes in the form of some gorgeous, and near classical-music-influenced guitar harmonies.<br /><br />Back on the heavy side, memorably meaty, and vintage Sabbath-sounding riffage and blistering solo flights abound throughout \\"Age Of Reason.\\" And \\"Live Forever\\" is another thunderous number that explodes with some especially nasty and brutal riff slices and lumbering, sludge-filled grooves. But one must not forget to mention that the track has some more good soloing and another immediately hooky and memorable chorus, too. Next up, \\"Damaged Soul,\\" a sludgy, plodding, and murky brooder with some faintly jazzy-sounding guitar leads, deft, rolling drum fills, and a really infectious (and downright hummable!) riff, has all the potential and key ingredients it needs to be a potential hit single. And the only thing that stands in its way of this is the fact that it also boasts extensive soloing -- it features the most solos of any song on the album. And what dazzling solos they are, too -- they are soaring, melodically shredding, and often wailing. (Heck, there is even one solo that evokes classic Jimi Hendrix!) The last song on the first disc is \\"Dear Father,\\" another huge highlight. Some eardrum-catching \\"wah-wah\\" guitar licks introduce this number before a fairly crushing and very massive, pure doom metal-riff comes smashing through the mix, thus taking the track off into a different direction. And monstrous, extremely chunky, churning, eminently unforgettable, drop-tuned -- boy, oh boy, this riff is indeed really one for the ages, too!<br /><br />The second disc begins on a fairly familiar but no-less potent note, with \\"Methademic\\" beginning with a beautiful acoustic intro. But then, around thirty ticks in, it switches to a surprisingly brisk tempo (with brutal, funk-tinged riffing), thus making this song a not un-blistering one. And working similarly, \\"Peace Of Mind\\" also has a flawless and perfectly seamless transition, as it switches from an ominous slow doom metal stomp to up-tempo chugging. As such, it might be the album's shortest song (it just barely reaches the 3:40 mark), but \\"Peace...\\" is nonetheless another big standout. And then comes \\"Pariah,\\" which adheres to another thunderous, lumbering groove that is tattooed by a great, headbangable riff, and tacks on another fluidly jazzy, clean, and memorable guitar solo section, ultimately comes across sounding not unlike a blues-metal-inflected mosher, and one that would not sound out of place on Led Zeppelin's \\"2.\\" And rounding out the set is \\"Naivete In Black,\\" which, with its exceedingly brisk and aggressive tempo, almost reaches near speed-metal-lite levels of intensity. (Thus, it makes for an unexpected, but indisputably strong way to close out the album.)<br /><br />Stripped down to nuts and bolts, \\"13\\" is everything you could ever dream of it being, and more. It is brilliantly played, written, delivered, and produced, thus making it emphatically transcendental of the seemingly almost impossible high expectations that preceded it. It is a flat-out excellent piece of work, a bona-fide return to form, and a definite front-running candidate for being the best metal release of the year (2013). A one sentence, two word review? Killer album!the album. And what dazzling solos they are, too -- they are soaring, melodically shredding, and often wailing. (Heck, there is even one solo that evokes classic Jimi Hendrix!)

B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this show! Action , comedy, drama, all in one. With a little love story underlying. Great show. Love the story concept.  Zoe is awesome.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Its a movie that starts with that subtle stress from the beginning. Starts right into the plot and delivers throughout. Nothing overboard or unpredictable about the story, it slowly proceeds on the similar line with good acting performances. Overall a good 4 star movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It will really eat up an afternoon on you if you are not careful
B008JFUOWM|4.0|Dominic, Brian and their team come back for another mission in Europe. Their job is to capture a heist group leader Owen Shaw, who was a former British Special Forces soldier. Their reward is a full pardon from the government. Plus, Dom has a special reason to join the mission as his ex-girlfriend Letty might be part of Shaw's gang.<br /><br />Some may say the story of the sixth \\"F&F\\" franchise is not only incredible but silly, full of plot holes and absurd decision-making. During the action scenes, some of which contain stunts involving a tank and an airplane, cars flip and fly in the air in a most ridiculous way. This I had expected, having enjoyed the previous high-octane action \\"Fast Five.\\"<br /><br />And I enjoyed the action set-pieces in \\"Fast & Furious 6,\\" even though I felt the action scenes are cut too fast, and editing is sometimes confusing, especially during the highway scene. Also, the latest \\"F&F\\" ends with a slightly sad note, as some players reprise their characters for the last time here.<br /><br />\\"Fast & Furious 6\\" ends with a cameo appearance of a certain star in a brief Tokyo scene, a sort of teaser for the next \\"Fast & Furious\\" film that is scheduled to be released in 2014.
B00821OX98|5.0|Foot surgery has me pinned down on the couch so I did a Falling Skies marathon. I'm totally invested in this show now. The characters are very believable in this show and there were a few very touching moments in the first season. Now I'm off to start the second season.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm always looking for a good horse app, and this was the best there is! I love it and I'm SO addicted!!!!
B008VO3PA4|5.0|I loved this as it is told from the cats point of view. Very cute and funny. Will read it many times. If you admire cats this is book for you!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Gaiman at his best.  Sparking prose. Dazzling plot.  Extraordinary depth. We are what we remember. But our memories are, well, hardly static.  Could not put down. Recommend to anyone who loves intelligent and intellectually provocative fantasy fiction.
B00464F19Q|5.0|Seven is a movie before it's time. It's a high intensity Criminal Minds type of movie. I really enjoyed it.
B00DM12ANO|3.0|Odd premise.  Clever. But not an especially good movie.  Too bad as more could have been done with the concept.  Still, what's not to like about Kirsten Dunst?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Ideally you should start with watching Season 1 and the 1st episode as there are many characters and storylines that carry over into the 3rd season.
B001SZ8Y72|4.0|The story line is interesting but the storyline is hard to follow, the actors are too cartoonish, and the whole story lacks good continuity.  While it is a good, fun family movie, do not expect too much.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Do have 45 minutes to watch some grainy old clip.  It starts and stops.  Takes forever and a day to load.  My netflix works perfectly....why does youtube have such poor functionality?
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie. Great acting. Great actors. Bruce Willis was really funny. I like the story. Really cool set up. Great.
B00957T6X6|4.0|I'm still reading it but Amazon must think it's been long enough because it asked for my review today.  No, Amazon, it will take a little longer than a month to finish this series.  I am enjoying every chapter.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This watch was a great buy for me.  I needed a watch for work; I work in a factory so not something too fancy to get scratched up, and this is perfect.  (not to say this is not a nice looking watch)  The watch face is very easy to read, shows the date and day, and the hands/number indicators glow in the dark.  I was actually surprised at the quality of this watch due to the price here on amazon.  It was well above what I was expecting and it is holding up nicely.  I'm sure everyone who's had a watch knows the feeling of getting the first scratch on the face - I've hit this watch many times on metal, heard the noise, and looked down to see what has become of my watch; not yet has there been any sign of damage.  Not a single scratch on this watch yet; point is, it's a nice quality watch.  It is a self winding watch and you do not have to do much extra to keep it going.  Right out of the box from being shipped to me it was working just from that movement.  I wear it 12+ hours a day for 5 days of the week, the other days I simply hold it in my hand and spin it around for a bit to get it wound for the day/night ( I do not know if this is necessary I just do it so as to not have to reset the time). The inside is a clear back so you can see it winding if you have any question as to whether it is working properly or not.  Keeps time well, some days loses a second or two, some days none.  The band is very comfortable for me, it gets hot at work and the band does not make my wrist overly sweaty like some bands can do.  Overall I am very happy with this purchase, great price and great quality.
B0027MJU00|4.0|This reminded me a lot of Gone Girl. I read it on my vacation to Hawaii and really enjoyed it as a beach read. The ending wasn't my favorite and was a little unexpected (just like Gone Girl ), but it kept my interest nonetheless. I couldn't put the book down until the very end. Although they aren't my favorite books, Gillian Flynn is a really good writer and finds the dark in all of her characters while somehow making them all realistic and many likeable. Overall, I would definitely recommend this book and her others to anyone looking for a fun and exciting book.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I downloaded this game just because it looked interesting. little did I know that I would be instantly hooked to the point I drain my kindle battery playing it so much and have even had dreams about playing. I have warned you! once you start it, you cannot stop. highly recommend!
0425252868|5.0|This story goes beyond the who, where, and when to the WHY, and in the process reaches into the souls of men on both sides of the conflict to reveal some honest, honorable motivations.  The narrative grabs hold of you and demands that you go through it one sitting.  Excellent!
B00BHMETKC|5.0|One of the better movies from 2012.  Lots of action. Less the four dollars to rent, what do you have to loose.
B00CNEVHMG|5.0|Every copy of this album I have owned has clearly suffered from limitations of either the album or CD format.  Finally, Audio Fidelity has put considerable effort into the mastering so that the original intentions are able to come through.  Both SACD and CD layers are the best I've heard.  if you loved the album, you are going to really love this new edition.
0446530573|5.0|I already had this book and bought it as a birthday gift for an Italian male friend who loves to cook. Needless to say, he loves it too.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|It is very cute pool.  It was a little difficult to blow up.  Some of the air openings were difficult to get to.  But overall a good little pool.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love this app it lets me communicate with my favorite authors and know about their contest or when their booms are released
0345529057|5.0|Well for the content of the books i can't say something more than that it kicks serious ass!!! The paperback edition is superb, easy to hold and is what i call \\"for one-two reads\\"-life expectancy! I say that because something is sure to happen and destroy the book unless you are really carefull of course! Ah and forgot to mention, extremelly cheap!!!
B006LSZECO|1.0|One daughter liked this but my other daughter and I really hated it.  The ending was scary and depressing.  I am really sorry I read it.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Title speaks for itself. Dont waste your time on a movie that goes NOWHERE and leaves w a feeling like a \\"chinese food of the movie world\\". You watch it and by the end you are hungry for a real movie that you set out to watch.
B000QI2ZWW|5.0|Love this movie and the music! Great animation and teaches children that fathers are able to raise children too! Good family movie time.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I purchased this book after reading Something Borrowed.  Happy I did.  This book tells the story from a different perspective. I appreciate a book that filled with surprises. Although I didn't want to put it down towards the end, I gave it 4 stars because I enjoyed Something Borrowed more.
B000P6YNSE|4.0|This is a very interesting series. It was always hard to go to bed after an episode or two and not stay up all night watching more
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really wasn't sure what to expect but it is even better than the first! And the last one is the best :)
B000FIMG68|4.0|This is a very interesting series. It was always hard to go to bed after an episode or two and not stay up all night watching more!
B0095P33IW|2.0|Too PC. Hail Heitler, swastika changed to another symbol, etc. Not in the original comic tradition. it was very disapponting
B005C0DHEY|1.0|Being a person who has grown up in the oil and gas industry I feel like this movie is full of lies.  If you're looking for a movie to help make your mind up about fracking you should watch something different.  If you don't believe me do a little research and you'll see what I mean.
B00BC24NT4|1.0|Kept waiting for the plot to start.  Plot revolves around cover-up related to UK/US joint operation that goes wrong. The problem is that the kind of collateral damage described in the novel happens every day in the real world and no one gives a damn. One dimensional characters, no suspense and not worth a read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game is sooooooo addicting it is challenging and it turns u into an investigator.I love this game and cant wait 4 new levels
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Beautiful Disaster is a crazy ride at times. Abby is running from a life/childhood that she doesn't want anyone to know about - she is looking for calm, predictable relationships. In walks Travis, a guy who fights in basements at college to earn money that sports several tattoos and is always smoking or drinking or both ... exactly what Abby is trying to avoid. When they first lock eyes you can tell something electric has happened. Jamie McGuire then takes us on the crazy ride of how these 2 try not to date then must face the reality that yes, love has found them. I laughed, cried and screamed a few times but loved every minute of it! Thank you Jamie McGuire!
B0007NFL18|5.0|I listen to it all the time I love it the songs are great, the quality of the cd is as was stated in the comments by the seller.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|I've always loved this album, but I only had it on cassette.<br />I can't believe I waited so long to purchase it on CD...<br />It's so awesome, every song, every time.
B002VPEAM6|5.0|Simply wonderful. Creative. Clever. Surprising. Totally satisfying. A decent film but a fabulous book. It takes the genre of epistolary novel to new heights
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.<br />I absolutely love David Bowie, from the '60's all the way to 2013... pure magic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun app that entertains a wide array of people, the only downside is the large use of apps. It's fun but gets a little boring after a while.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I can't get enough of this show.<br />Worth the time spent watching.<br />Clever and extremely well written and acted.<br /><br />Can't wait for Season 3...
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|Didn't live up to the hype little disjointed. Altogether still a good read and had some funny moments.  Tina Fey comes off relatable if not always enthusiastic about writing the book.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I enjoyed the first part of this book, but it seemed the last part was too formulaic.  Not as good as his first two
B005SAP45I|5.0|Watched while on the plane. Great for passing the time and the clarity was good. Will try another movie for the trip back.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I truly enjoy playing the game, just didn't appreciate it downloading on its own. Without asking first. Otherwise love it.
B00DGNO3WE|2.0|Fantastic line-up of stars, especially Maggie Smith. I couldn't wait to see her in action. Perhaps my expectations were too high going into another British movie, but unfortunately it didn't move me as much as I had hoped. In fact, I fast-forwarded the ending just to get through it.  I so hate giving a two-star review to great artists.  But just because they are, it doesn't make the work itself a great picture.<br /><br />It's a story about a retirement home where aging musicians go to live out the remainder of their lives.  Many of them know each other from the early days when they were at the highlight of their careers.  They have now congregated in one place to continue dabbling in the art of music while they wait for the undertaker to take them away in a body bag.<br /><br />Maggie Smith plays Jean Horton, a once famous and highly sought after opera singer who is now old, broke, and alone.  (Of course they say she's broke, but I'm not sure how she affords the swanky retirement home.)  Like most elderly, her baggage upon arrival is filled with bitterness over life. To make matters worse, she discovers that her ex-husband is living out his days at the retirement home as well.  He's not much better when it comes to forgiveness for Jean's early days of adultery, so most of the movie he has a chip on his shoulder along with the air of being a former star himself.<br /><br />The storyline is weak, superficial, and frankly uninteresting.  I will say this, that it would be a great place to retire! The movie is set in an converted English manor, with gorgeous countryside, comfortable and beautiful interior, kind staff, and an eclectic mix of eccentric elderly. You can sing your days away, rumba to music, croquet to your heart's content, and walk the grounds with a dirty old man, if you'd like. However, the story, at least for me, started with a great premise, but moved at a snail's pace.<br /><br />If the movie accomplishes anything, it does give a poignant view of aging and how one's youth and glory fades. We all know it's coming; perhaps we just don't wish to acknowledge it.<br /><br />Excuse me, while I search the Internet to find a retirement home in the UK that fits the description for retired authors.  I would love to pack my bags and take my own bitterness over life to a swanky retirement home in the English countryside to live out my days. I can pen murder mysteries until they haul me away in a body bag. Works for me.and how one's youth and glory fades.

B002XTBEDI|5.0|If you like these early British towns and values, you'll like this.  It take unexpected twists wnd turns and makes itself enjoyable.
B00003CXUM|5.0|This movie is quite possibly one of the best movies ever created. It goes far beyond the cookie-cutter romance movies that one may find today in theaters. A love that, unknowingly, blossomed in the midst of the despair of two crumbling relationships. The music score sets the tone and the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. This is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again; re-discovering the meaning behind the subtle movements and revisiting the same emotions that you felt when you first watched it. It moves at a much slower pace and allows the viewer to relish each scene without seeming sluggish and repetitive. Definitely one of those movies you have to see at least once in your life.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is fun I have been playing it for three years straight.  get this game now if u don't your stupid.
0786838655|1.0|I chose this used book because the description said good condition.  When I opened the package I was disappointed to see the book looked very worn and in poor condition.  The binding was broken and pages were bent.  It also been repaired a few times prior.  I have ordered used books before and been satisfied with the condition but this time it was not worth it, especially since it still cost about $4.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Kakuro is a great game -- good concept, good execution. The controls (buttons, pan, zoom)  work well in my KF. The instructions are clear. I think it might be an improvment to have the controls near the numbers (like one reviewer suggested) but, at any rate, it is not a huge deal. I simply do not understand the negative reviews -- maybe the developers fixed the issues? Kakuro works for me. Now, I think I'll just play one more game...
B006VFLIYK|4.0|This is a thrilling read.  It has so many connections and was real hard to figure out all the twists and turns.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|This is a beautifully produced series that helps mark a piece of our history that is rapidly being lost today.  Anything with Tom Hanks' involvement draws my attention...and most often my praise. And this is no exception. I shared it with my son and it initiated a discussion of what went on &#34;back in those days.&#34;  It was a whole facet of my life I've never thought of sharing with him - growing up in the war years.  What was shocking to me was that none of the details of that history in our country was taught during his school years.  The Pacific, and my own personal stories of that time, opened a world my son had not known before.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|if your bored and have nothing to do for a few minutes its good to play just be sure to know when to quit
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|Great salsa music with an incredible romantic message. Marc Anthony really took his time to look inside himself and relate to most of us.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A well written series with an exceptional cast make for an addictive series I couldn't get enough of.  I am waiting patiently for the next season.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unable to get Season 3 anywhere else without paying an arm and a leg.  Able to watch whenever I had time here and there.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B00CFITJKW|3.0|don't get me wrong this game looks fun but if it was cheaper I would definitely try it. so, note to the creator -better graphics, and a little cheaper
B009XIXVU6|3.0|TO HARD TO FOLLOW ALL THE CHARACTERS.  JUMPS AROUND TO MUCH.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  NOT NEAR AS GOOD AS AUTHOR'S PREVIOUS BOOKS.
0316067598|3.0|it's okay.  Interesting read.  lots of information and fills in what these guys think and how they operate.  not really my style book.  most in my book club loved it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|a lot of fun sharing with friends giving and getting lives from them and trying to beat there score a great game to pass the time and enjoy with friends
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and very entertaining. The graphics are life like and the controls are easy enough to use and the online help is easy.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|For free it's not bad, fairly quick and gets the basic tasks done. It is an easy uninstall in the event you don't like it.
B00DYOOGYK|2.0|The Graphics were good and the combat is okay. That's the highlight of the game. It's all downhill from there. The movement is terrible, slow, unresponsive, and ill-thought through with many freerunning bugs causing the character to climb and jump despite the player trying to move the character another direction. The story tries too hard to continue itself, Clich&eacute; after Clich&eacute;, desperately grasping at straws to keep the story alive, IF, of course, you can make it far enough to see, because of all the mission crashes and freezes. The driving is okay in stick mode, but any variation of motion control is unplayably bugged. The motion control is inverted and, no pun intended, causes motion sickness. It tries to auto-adjust so when you<br />tilt, you're looking at the same image despite the fact that your device is tilted 45 degrees, but because it's backwards, it really messes with you, making you feel like vomiting. Despite the price, this game is loaded with IAP, so if I didn't feel cheated already I'd feel cheated about that.<br /><br />This was an absolute waste of seven dollars, but I did have a minute or two of fun just racking up stars robbing a casino. Overall, I give this game two stars. If you want a similar experience, but done much, much better, just get Gangstar Rio: City of Saints.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|As soon as I purchased the KIndle version of this book, it uploaded automatically in my iPad. I love how fast that I could start to read the book.
0425252868|5.0|This story kept me very interested. It increased my knowledge of just how it was during that period, and an increased respect for our service men.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|It is another quell game, with new kinds of ways the bubbles can move/act to complete the puzzle.<br />The old house is just the setting for each game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|FUN to play. Not difficult to play. Needs more levels to keep your interest and more detailed description of how to play.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! I would recommend this to everyone kids or adults!!!! It is fun for fans of the movie. Very fun!!! It has bananas and is a lot like Temple Run.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Truth: I feared doing this workout! However, 15 days in and that fear has left my body and has been replaced with a serious drive to conquer all new fitness goals. If you're on the fence, stop thinking about it and just do it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it it keeps your mind always working some levels are hard but just work on it youll get it
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Upon starting this book, chosen through my book club,  I was very hesitant to read this harsh, cruel subject matter. But after starting and pushing through the first chapter with one eye closed, I found myself getting more and more involved and had difficulty putting it down. Told through the eyes of a child was brilliant. I highly recommend this book. My book club also loved it unanimously.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I first got this game for my children and tried it.  I love it and now my children and I compete to see who gets further.
B003MYYJD0|4.0|The watch is really nice, but be careful if you have a small wrist like mines as it looks too big.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Its a great set of games, i have not yet played it though. It came in like new with the manual.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie enough to watch it twice, something i rarely do. A good mix of drama, comedy and action. A fair representation of the characters adapted from the comics.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Yes, we have another Robert Langdon book, and yes,we have another torridly paced thriller that keeps the reader enthralled right up to the final chapter.<br />We also have another great villain in Maleklek'h.  I can recommend this book,but I did not care for the final payoff. I found it uninteresting.<br />If you like to read about Masonic Lore, you will love this book!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I usually run iobit asc but it isn't available for kindle fire HD. This little app does a good job of keeping my device running well. It's true that it doesn't seem to clear apstore or silk history however what it does do is clear up space and speed up a device that has gotten slower since you bought it as they all do. I recommend it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It's awesome to be able to customize sounds.  I have already created a few.  I think it's fantastic to have something of this quality for free.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|This book has been the foundation of my CG journey. I am truly inspired with confidence that I too can achieve beautiful healthy hair. Thank you so much Lorraine!!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the show!  This show is awesome, keeps you glued to the screen! Would I recommend it ? Without a doubt yes!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is really fun.  Each room has new and exciting challenges to overcome.  I still need help on each level.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This is an indispensable tool for any Android device owner, for anyone with more than a passing interest in YouTube.
161655164X|5.0|Artwork is awesome makes a makes a cool coffee tabl coffee table piece. Great piece to add to my collection of my post pandemic edition
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love the fact that I can continue reading while out somewhere and have a few unexpected minutes, not having to take my Kindle with me.  I also like the 'sync' feature.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|I am sick someone give me an update please my brother is winning the race.he gets crazy updates ,which is making him WIN!!!!!!!!!!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The movie was exciting but if you've read the books, you know Tom cruise just can't be Reacher.  Not tall enough. Still, he did a decent job and you can't beat anything touched by Lee Childs.
B00DURGZHW|5.0|What a well written and interesting movie.<br />A very different role for Mathew M. and perfectly played.<br />I would highly reccommend.
B002KS1IJC|5.0|GrittY alien time traveling historical. Superb acting. Excellent effects.  Some appropriate humor thrown in and a beautiful badass woman.  Great stuff.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I gladly gave up three nights  sleep, and many stolen minutes during the intervening days  to enter the world of Mr. Hosseinis beautifully realized characters.  W. C. Herman
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|After reading the two previous books, I was extremely disappointed with the third installment. I am a big Sylvia Day fan but Entwined let me down. At this point of the story I feel like there should be more substance to the book than just sex. I recognize the chemistry between these two and I get it. I think the author pushes that a bit much. In all fairness I will admit that I only read 75 percent of the book, but it was a struggle trying to read to that point. The story just didn't continue to grab my attention as it did previously. I have no desire to finish the book and I can't believe there is a fourth book to come.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|A book is valued by its impact. Some are read for pure entertainment, the impact of the book being enjoyment. Others are read to provide instruction or insight. This one has helped me lay down my stop watch, GPS, and running schedule  and simply run.<br /><br />The story line has been interwoven between some facts about running and shoes and the running industry. A combination of fact and story kept my interest.<br /><br />And now? I'm going for a run.
B006LSZECO|2.0|My daughter told me this was a must read...  So I read it.  Very disappointing.  I'm waiting through this whole book for something to happen, but NOPE.  Banter between husband and wife, blah blah blah, just was NOT interesting to me at all!!
B009J2VR3Y|4.0|Such a talent. She had a voice like no other. The world has suffered a  real loss at such a young age.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a lot like Temple Run.  However I like it better because of the settings, variety of &quot;,helpers&quot;,and the minions.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|This movie does so much with such a little budget. The creativity really shines with slo-mo and the characters and the violence. Seriously, the violence is beautiful and I've never said that before, you can bet.<br /><br />On another level it's brilliant because it's an action movie with four distinct and interesting female characters (none of which are a love interest) and that's cool.<br /><br />In a world with three comic book movies a season this one stands out and deserves attention. And a sequel. And a franchise.<br /><br />So go watch it.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Wonderful Love story about the longevity of true love no matter what the obstacles may be! A young writer publishes a book about his amazing evening with the love of his life.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|this was for my 2 year old grandson that is learning to build and use his imagination. he mixes all the pieces to make new things
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I trust Neil Gaiman to be exactly what he is: unpredictably good! Thoroughly enjoyed this story, though the book was rather short.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I gig this game I found it about two years ago and its been one of my favorites thank you for letting me play.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|Bruno Mars has a style all his own. This CD has several of his hits that I know so I really did enjoy the music and songs on this CD.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Liked it but didn't love it- sort of low drama and somewhat of a letdown compared to th  prior books in the series
B006LSZECO|1.0|Well written and interesting for the first half. The psycho bitch became overwhelming and there was not one sympathetic character.  A waste of time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a GREAT GAME it keeps kids occupied and the little sound effects the minion makes cracks me up !!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Really enjoyed this one. I will definetely tell my friends and can't wait for the nextone to come out. EXCELLENT
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown has the ability to draw you into the story so you can't put the book down and you learn a lot of historical facts as well.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|Sorry I ever downloaded this one!!! Definetey the worst calendar program I've experienced. DON'T BOTHER. NO, NO, NO, NEVER AGSIN.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love an intelligent, well written book. Who doesn't right. So many books I buy have predictable story lines and/or are not constructed with correct grammar structure. Well Max nailed it with this book. So depthful, each chapter exceedingly well done and adding berth to the book's concept. Max is brilliant and a wonderful storyteller.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was a little shocked when I first started reading it.  I was hooked in the first chapter.  Very interesting and sexy book!
B009CWWFD2|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is a Great storyteller.  The story holds ones interest.  It is very difficult to put the book down once you start reading.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I loved The Host and thought if was a great adaptation of the novel.The casting was great, especially Max Irons in the role of Jared.
B002OMZTSU|5.0|I just finished this book less than a minute ago. Now, because of my dyslexia I actually bought the audible.com version read by Craig. I laughed, I choked up, I smiled and every other emotion that could be felt was. I have been a fan of Craig since I first saw him on the Drew Carey show and late nights since 2004 whenever I can either stay awake by choice or the insomnia monster hits I watch him on TV. He is candid, offers hope, sensibility and humor in every form and fashion. I have no clue how many times I heard him swear - that's my only dislike of the book but certainly not enough to even warrant something less than 5 stars as I already knew he had a mouth (and a set of eyes that will melt your heart!!). If you're a fan pick up the book - though I strongly suggest buying the audible version because there is something about hearing it in his voice with his inflections - loved this book! It's truly, a great day for America everybody!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|This app is very  easy to learn ,also its fun and enjoyable their is a good variety of songs to chose from :)  Everyone should play it and have fun :) ;) :) :)
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I've enjoyed this a lot, very sweet game! It's entertaining and makes me want a horse of my own! I just love the graphics
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|As a child my grandmother always read me the stories from The Jungle Book before bed. Now it is still great as my grandmother told it and even better to read!
B008BM9L72|5.0|A delightfully well written young painting in words of so much that is hidden and lies desiring in so many.  Great plot, a gentle sweetness throughout, enough dramatic happenings and beautiful happy ending.  This trilogy will hopefully open a new era of realistic yearnings and deep love.<br /><br />sigh, there have been such harsh critics but I feel many fear revealing their true appreciation.
0739367676|5.0|Jacob imprinted on Bella's daughter, her daughter was growing so fast, she can eat food and blood. The people came to see Bella's daughter what she is.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This series has some ethics, morals and values (unlike some coming out these days. Plus it's very entertaining. Good action, good story lines.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Bella is a vampire now she is so strong and she is also a human shield. She is a good hunter for blood.
B0045HCIYA|3.0|Wrote the book (& many others!) this is based on (another is &#34;Hoot&#34; - definitly different- that's for sure !) So- I'll watch & remember!
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I like the part when Bella got married to Edward a vampire.  The part when they went on their honeymoon and they had sex and he got her pregnant with the thing that almost killed her, and he turned her into a vampire after he delivered their baby girl. When Jacob imprinted on Bella's daughter.
B000YJ85BI|5.0|A real great read. Really didn't dislike anything, if anything I was surprised after I read some comments about the battles in the book was almost anemic considering that that it is a military scifi of sorts. Well, I did not perceive this as a hack'n slash and shoot'em up kinda book, the battles was described just fine. A true must read for scifi fans.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|For the Eagles fan this is as good as it gets.  All of your favorite songs done live and almost perfectly.....actually this may be better that the studio recordings....  Highly Recommended.  It arrived safely and I would recommend the package. A++++
B000SEIK2S|5.0|...And it was meant to be here...but I just started to leave a review after the third book was done, and mistook book 3 for 1. What can you read of this? At least that I finished the 3 books? I was too eager to leave a review and got it all mixed up? I am confused person? Probably all :) But don't let that stop you from reading this great book - and series - an absolutely must read for true scifi fans.
B00AHJL7BK|2.0|I love Kakuro and downloaded this game because it was free today. It is just ok, but not worth paying for. There are much better Kakuro games for free in the store.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was hesitant to watch this show at first, but got hooked after seeing the first episode. Amazing epic drama!!
B004X6PRO6|4.0|This novel puts your head into the mindset of an autocratic civilization and turns the screws. It will be as close as I get to North Korea.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|A good page-turner!<br />Very adventurous, and makes think about the politics in the world that you are currently living.<br />Highly recommended.
1451695195|3.0|Well written, but I didn't find that he proved that heaven exists.  I guess because the author is a neurosurgeon, the reader is supposed to swallow his views because he &#34;so credible.&#34;  It's an interesting book though, and I've heard and read similar near death experiences from others.
1616551607|5.0|it gets shipped in two boxes the slipcase itself is felt covered the books are hardbound and for the 60 bucks I paid for this thing was a steal. the art is like looking into the mind of a master of the craft. I would highly recommend it to any other art students or fans of Final Fantasy:)
B0032SMR1W|5.0|It didn't suck.  I thought it was pretty frackin awesome, not gonna lie.  Awesome story line and killer acting job.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|the game is great and all but there aren't enough levels in the game to be challenging all I ask for is 15 levels
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun and easy to learn puzzle game.  I played the first 5 levels and they increased slightly in difficulty.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I got this game a bit before they updated it bit now that it is updated it is really fun must get
B006M4F67A|3.0|This WAS a five star game until the recent update. Now Ive lost some of the original levels and would have to pay AGAIN to get them back! not cool.
B003BKZW2W|5.0|King is always good, especially with his &#34;less weird&#34; stories.  This story was great, I was hanging on his every word.  Such a great writer.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Never go to see it. I will order another soon. Left it in a hotel and they never found it. I never even unwrapped it. How sad!
B00AW57L96|4.0|The story unfolds, and yes, I was surprised at the &#34;secret&#34;, but from that point I was a bit frustrated.  To tell or not to tell??  Still, a good read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am a big fan of these sort of games, and this one is one of the better ones. Not super difficult, but not super easy.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love this game when it is working properly.  Unfortunately the app often freezes during play.  This can be very frustrating...especially when you have a good game under way.  If theycould remedy the technical issues I would give this game a 5* rating.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I love this game its super fun and interactive. Amazing game. Lotsa fun and entertainment. Love the powers and graphics that it has.
B009GX69RK|5.0|This is a great show!! I literally laughed out loud so many times. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a good laugh.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book was only ok in my estimation.  Compared to his first two novels, this book was a let down.  He wrote about too many characters some of whom were boring.  I kept waiting for the plot to improve but after the first hundred or so pages the book became confusing.  This author is very talented but this time around  his efforts failed to keep my interest  till the end.
B00992CF6W|3.0|mindcraft is cool I just don't get it much feels like I'm a nerd but buy this game if you like
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|The Perks of being a wallflower is an underrated movie. The story follows a young man named Charlie and his experience during his freshman year in high school. This film has drama and has it's comedic moments as well. It does get dark as you keep watching.  There are many great quotes in this film that will touch your heart. I highly recommend this film.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|My husband loves the Beach Boys and this was a good choice for him. He was very happy to have it in his collection.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Good games, good variety. Love that there are free daily tournaments for those times you have run out of chips!
0802473156|5.0|I have shared this book with many couples, newly  together or married for years and he response is always the same; THANK YOU. I wish I had read it years ago it could have saved me some difficult times.<br />Happy Reading
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|A great series! The acting, as one would expect from Spacey and Wright, is spot-on perfection. The story is intriguing and enlightening -- confirming what we already know about politics while knowing it would make us happy to be wrong.<br /><br />The series continually took little punches at my moral standards. How could I possibly cheer the bad guy to victory? Why would nativity drive me to distraction -- after all, &#34;she&#34; couldn't help it if she only saw goodness in everyone else.<br />For anyone who likes to actually think outside of their normal boundaries Game of Cards is fun, fun, fun.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|This is such a terrific movie.  Acting is superb by both main actors. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|The game play was fun and Roby is adorable, however having to be logged in to play is a major negative.  I wanted this for my tablet so that I could play even without internet access.  Disappointingly contingent on being connected to play.  I would have rated a little higher on game play alone if not for this contingency.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|How nice to see an adventure/comedy/love story that you don't have to hide from the kids! On a recent family visit, I went to investigate the source of so much LAUGHTER in the TV room!  Everyone was watching seasons of this show..even into the wee hours!<br /><br />As soon as we got home, I ordered all of the Seasons, so we could continue the Party!
B001NLKT60|3.0|I liked the book. However, reading the other book first it was tiresome to re-read the same history again in this book.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|good game. much better than 3. and very happy that it can be played on my kindle fire. 4 stars because graphics on kindle could be cleaned up some.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have enjoyed the other two books by this author as well.  I got a little lost with all the different characters but it came together in the end.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|What a refreshing change from most of today's movies.  Great acting skills and no sex scenes.  A bit predictable, but wonderful nonetheless.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This was another great book!  Make sure you don't have anything else to do because you won't be able to put it down.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my sis fight for the kindle just to play this game it's kind of a addicting just like candy crush saga
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The series offers up another winner. They somehow manage to make every years game better than the last. Keep it up guys! Only problem might be the game isn't longer.
B000Q76K1A|5.0|I've always loved The Bourne Identity. Saw it on Amazon and wanted to watch it, again. Great movie, great acting.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Every step this program takes is right-on and a total viewing pleasure. From the plot to the costumes to the acting, this program is one in a million. A must experience for everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is really fun I play this game lot more ever since I first played .
B009ZE27US|1.0|I have tried to get this app working over and over and over again. Now I am yong nit even a teenage yet and this app. has told me I. am 90
B006LSZECO|1.0|Yet another in a long line of novels that are short on story and characterization and long on the writer combining words in whatever way will keep readers turning the pages (and guarantee Hollywood will come calling for script rights). The main characters are horrible people; worse, their awfulness quickly becomes predictable. I guessed every decision they would make well before the page revealed it, and kept plowing on only so I could tell my book club members that I read the whole thing. As for the ridiculous ending, it didn't outrage me so much as fill me with relief that finally I was done with this dreadful tome. My greatest regret is that I paid money for this waste of several days of reading time.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|After watching this film it made me want to go to India very badly and perhaps even live there one day. I hope there is a Exotic Marigold Hotel! The acting is great and the scenes are beautiful with colors.
0425252868|5.0|Best book I have ever read ,could not put it down.Reminded me of stories I was told by people who fought in the second world war.
B009G78EE2|5.0|The music is really inspiring and well written. I'm not a huge rap fan, but this is a new take on the genre perhaps.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|These are the minions at their BEST!  Thus game is fun comical and challenging for &quot;completionists&quot; such as myself.  For grown up kids as well as the little ones...better than Temple run and Subway surfer (both great games) COMBINED!!!<br /><br />Just waiting for them to bring on the &quot;Macho&quot; man!!
0525953728|3.0|The insider details of the raid were interesting, but you have to go through  a lot of low key bragging and self-agrandizement to get there.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is amazingly addicting<br />people of all ages would love this game<br />the missions are funny. its just amazing
B006IYG5HE|5.0|Having read The Bat, I decided to see if I could handle The Redbreast. The reviewers made it quite clear that the jumping back and forth from the 1940s,  the Norwegian soldiers on the front, the emotional turmoil of the war to the 2000s and complexities surrounding Harry Hole's career, life, loves etcetera would be hard to follow.<br /><br />Surprisingly, given that so many movies jump back and forth,that wasn't the hardest part. Yes, the Norwegian names of places and people get one a little bogged down. But follow the dialogue of the characters in the past and present as the victims and others appear and it becomes a fun puzzle to put together.<br /><br />I missed it in the end...the result of good writing and subtle dialogue. Brilliant ending. A bit bloody but no more so than a lot of today's shows. This is just far better drama.<br /><br /> Wow, be prepared for some surprises and a remarkably happy ending for Harry. I couldn't put my Kindle down. Helped pass away my chemo treatments and kept me focused on \\"where is this going next.\\"<br /><br />Movies?
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Although it started out flat, I was very moved by the story by the end. It raises lots of issues.
B000TU16GS|3.0|This book is definitely James Bond for teens. This is the first in a series about 14 year old Alex Rider, who is chosen after his uncle's death to take up his failed mission as a spy for M16, Britain's intelligence agency. The story may not be deep enough to entice adult readers, but all of the action and suspense is sure to entertain young readers.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|While the quality of the prose equalled his first two books, I found the story line to be disjointed at times.  On the other hand, like in &#34;The Bridge At San Louis Rey&#34;, the personal journeys that ended with these characters from very different backgrounds meeting at an intersection of cultures and history that is very poignant to today's situation, provides an intriguing view of how our world is interconnected in sometimes magical ways.  As usual, Hosseini tells the story through vivid characters and events from real life.  I found the book to be a worthy follow-on from his first two books and look forward to his next.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|I'd watched this before in the nineties but my wife had never seen it so we gave it a whirl. A sickening voyage into the minds and experiences of a vietnam war era marine, from the first day to some questionable time in the thick of battle, this movie will take you for a ride. One that you won't be sure if you liked or hated so much as that you can only decide that you appreciate the time spent.<br /><br />I think the scariest and most telling thing is the attitude of some of the soldiers in the vietnam portion- the sadistic narcissism of the fellow on the helicopter ride as he fires down at the villagers, the strange mix of racism and fellowship of the marines the protagonist falls in with and an ambivalence toward the enemy soldiers (Hatred but a small shred of understanding gnawing at everyone that they, too, are soldiers and people).<br /><br />A very complicated film, Full Metal Jacket really pulls you into the thick of the 70's/Vietnam era and seats you into the marine life of the period.
0345529057|5.0|This set looks lovely, and it's so much cheaper than buying them all individually! The series is delightfully sophisticated and a credit to the fantasy genre.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is so much fun to play. It's very addictive. I just wish they lasted longer.I love the way it looks on my fire HD. Just beautiful..
0553801473|5.0|The book and cover are gorgeous, and in this instance, you can definitely judge the contents by it! Fantastic story--eagerly awaiting the next book! I generally prefer paperback, but this one is so lovely that I may have to repurchase the previous titles in hard back to match. Happy reading!
B0062NAX1U|4.0|I usually don't like Christian movies because they tend to be low budget and cheesy, always hitting you over the head with the same morals over and over. But this movie was different. It still had moments of that stuff, but overall I really liked the story and felt the characters had more depth and personality than they usually do in Christian films.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesome great fun for all ages. The minions are so so cute I have told all my friends and family
0307887448|5.0|I cannot wait to read more from this author. I haven't read an original sci-fi story of this quality in ages. It's smart, detailed, and extremely well written, with characters that have complex personalities and real heart.<br /><br />I know it's cliche to say, but this really is a must read for fans of good sci-fi literature.
0345505387|5.0|I loved seeing how each of the key players in the book looked.  The book also filled in some of what was left out of the original book.  I really, really enjoyed it.
0140120416|4.0|I was looking for a book that would actually help me start the daunting task of learning the Russian language, and sadly only came up with tourist books for a long time. I wanted more than stock vocabulary and learning how to ask where the bathroom was, and finally found this excellent book.<br /><br />This book does it right. They start out teaching you the basics of the Russian alphabet, and then once you can read basic words, starts diving into a quality language course light on memorization and heavy on actually learning the concepts required. Exactly what I was looking for!
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I enjoy this show immensely.  So many intricacies and great characters.  Recommend it highly - can't wait for next season
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Personally, I like the game itself but very odd layout. I tried to x out but it wouldn't unfortunately. As for the game itself I give it ***** but the layout just sucks
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like this little game because it uses the whole screen to show the puzzles. Where other games only use about half the screen
B00B2V66VS|5.0|SOOO ADDICTING! HALF THE FUN IS GETTING THE MISSIONS DONE!GETTING AS MANY COINS AS I POSSIBLY CAN! TOO GREAT TO PUT DOWN!
B00D2BHO44|5.0|This is a great soundtrack for a great game. Drop the money on this to support the developers and let them know you want more like this.
B0090SI56Y|5.0|I Have too admit this movie is a little slow in the beginning but after it finds a pace it is an excellent movie that is Much better than its predecessor X-Men Origins:Wolverine. People Expecting great action sequences like The Avenger be warned because even though it does have GREAT Action Sequences (for example, The Bullet train scene), it is  mostly A character driven story that dwells deep into Wolverine's inner troubles as well as the new ones he faces during his journey in Japan. The movie also has a Surprise Ending that will satisfy any x-men movie fan an will make the hardcore X-Men fanboys(like me) go BAT SHIT CRAZY(in a good way).<br />This movies has its flaws but it is A solid movie in the X-Men franchise.<br />My Grade:8.9/10.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|just got it yesterday and we have watched it already. I am so happy I bought this movie. Will buy more ...
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I think this game is awesome better than the real card game loved it I am always playing it when I get a chance
B008I15774|5.0|This is one of the very best and most underappreciated Beethoven symphony cycles, with 1, 3, 4, 5, and 8 especially good.  The 9th is a bit disappointing, mostly because of the male soloists, who were great singers, but seemed to be having a bad day. The three Bruckner symphony performances are awesomely impressive as well, especially the 8th.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game because u get take care of horses and pretend that u have a real horse and then if u do get a horse u know what 2 do. People will see how fun and amazing horses can be and see that if you have friends with you they can help take Cate of your horse.
B008FC4WA4|5.0|I love him and how he writes and tells a story. Sometimes you are just in a mood for something short and not a whole book and this is a short story with the qualities of a whole novel.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|A birthday gift for my 3 year old grandson...he was over the moon! one two three four five six seven
B007RTAR64|5.0|Bought this for my granddaughter. She is a fan of The Hinger Games and loved this gift. Well made. Very pleased with purchase.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been looking for a portable dongle that I can use to stream Netflix into my television from my MS Surface Pro tablet. I am glad that I stumbled upon this product yesterday through CNET. The price is truly the deal maker and the features are just what I wanted. Now, I am enjoying Netflix through my TV flawlessly. I am looking forward to seeing more apps that will support Google Chromecast.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy the game. Easy to play and like the new format. Enjoying seeing what my score is for each game,I can then try to bet my last score.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great product. Got it in two days shipping! Love love love the Blu-ray! You can see the colors and pictures so much more clearer!! The only way to watch Downton Abbey indeed.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|It's the Original Dracula, what's not to like. Read the first Chapter and you wont want to put it down.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this cause it has horses and I'm an animal lover<br />Now I want a horse and its like Sims but with horses
B000AL730Y|5.0|Chaos and Creation is one of the best albums ever released. It takes a few listens to appreciate how great it really is. It is funny that after all the great Beatles and Wings stuff, this is the one album that I put into CD player all the time.
B003ELKNP4|3.0|I am a fan of country music and I heard that this CD is BON JOVI´s experiment of such kind of music. I recognized, that it definitely was not. Anyway it is good music, but not of my kind. By. OLD
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A touching and amazing story about a Neurosurgeon's battle with a deadly disease.  Well written, &#34;can't put it down&#34; book about a true story of a man fighting for his life and experiencing a Near Death Experience.  His family support was awesome, and was well told from their perspective.<br /><br />The story is told from a physicians point of view, with just enough medical information to be informative, but not over-whelming.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book, but would suggest a good supply of Kleenex as you read it!
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Great movie with great actors! Love the ending!! One of the best movies I've seen in a long long time!!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love the Kindle app. It organizes books, displays their covers and makes it very easy to find a book in my library. The problem with this app is that I have a very large ebook collection and my phone is running out of internal space. There is no way to change the directory of the library to the external sd card. If amazon would change this small problem I would go back to using this app. For now I am stuck using a generic ereader. For some reason nearly all of the generics have the ability to change the library directory but Kindle doesn't. Youd think that a billion dollar company would be able to add this feature if a guy making an ereader from his desk in his home office can.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I absolutely loathe the new version of The Weather Channel! The old version was much more user friendly and so much easier to find the information you needed. This new version is confusing and I find myself getting annoyed when trying to use it. PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD VERSION!! Old Version = 5 Stars ... New Version = 1 Star!
B005DJREJS|5.0|Fun stuff. First two seasons were free. Season one was better than two, but worth watching in ur free time in between movies or other shows
B009WUAK2M|1.0|Imagine walking into a nursing home and both residents and nurses are strapped to the nines engaged in some serious ass kicking altercations. One group of residents and nurses, led by an old guy with a funky French accent, is leading the charge to acquire all of the home's oxygen tanks to sell them to the nursing home across town for an astronomical price. Then there's the other group of residents and nurses, are led by an old guy with a drunken slur, and they are making every effort to stop the diabolical transaction from coming to a head. Now picture two random old guys who show up every now and then, bantering at each other and using the other's \\"tag lines\\" from 60 years ago, when they were 22.<br /><br />Now imagine that you stopped imagining the nursing home conflict and you actually went and watched The Expendables 2. I guarantee you that by the end of the film, you'll feel like you acquired dementia because you'll start to wonder if you forgot to take your medication for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday when you realize that not even you can duck and dodge around a staged scene, like Stallone, without the pain of arthritis and the risk of shattering your pelvis.<br /><br />Individually, all of these actors rock their own films. But for some reason when they're lumped all together into a single movie, it's seriously like watching an altercation at a nursing home.
B001NTZE9O|5.0|Fantastic vocals, great jazzy rock grooves. Brings back great memories to those who lived through the 1970s. A very polished effort, every track evokes a mood and a memory of romantic times past.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This book is written by a MUSLIM. He's not even a religious scholar. He's just some dude who thinks Jesus was a violent criminal and nothing more. Don't waste your time with this filth.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I saw this movie rented with Netflix and decided it was such a good movie that its one of the few I had to own and watch over and over.  The acting and story line was riveting from the very beginning.  Loved it!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great game! lots to do kinds hard which is great for game play. lags a little. all in all a great game tho
B00DU74U74|5.0|I loved the book and the movie.  I agree that much was lost in translation but it was still very moving.  The actress was chosen much better then Twilight. I liked Stephanie Meyers first book better then the series that we all know however, they were both beautifully written.  This movie is well worth seeing!
B008JFUNYG|1.0|Add another to the long list of terrible remakes. The plot holes and inconsistencies make this impossible for me to watch. Early on, the girl Mia is chased through the woods by her possessed self... If she hasn't been possessed yet, how is her possessed self chasing her???? And that is just the beginning of the blatant and unbelievable inconsistencies that went into making this film. When the heroine needs some gas for the chainsaw she bangs on a shelf and, da, da! a small water bottle full of gas falls into her hands. Like magic, very hokey magic. Who keeps gas in a water bottle, anyway??? These are just the tip of the iceberg, it's like watching a bad cartoon. I pointed out all the mind-numbing inconsistencies in a post on my blog, and there are A LOT of them. I would have rated this 0 stars but Amazon wont let me.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|The angry birds free download, attempts have failed, even though it states in an email I have it, it is unfound, invisible and must be in the twilight zone. It would be nice if the download could be made visible and I<br />could be happily playing angry birds. the invisible download is no fun. Any assistance in repairing this situation<br />Would be greatly appreciated.
B006CAXPSQ|4.0|Absolutelly delighted to watch Carlos Saura's Carmen again, after so many years. A real pleasure!. Fully recommended. Thank people at Amazon
B00CW665VI|5.0|5 stars!!  I loved every second of this book.  I laughed out loud quite a few times. I read this in two days because it was so good.  I highly recommend this book!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to play, and fun for all ages!<br />I've had this for a few days now and no complaints so far.
B0098460O4|5.0|Jonathan is the star that shines in this duo, I can't believe he was only 17 yrs old when they did this album. The next Pavarotti!!!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play. no bugs. ads are annoying but I understand their purpose.  I would recommend this game for anyone who limes solitare
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Mr minion rush is the best I had to download again cause it said that I had to buy it it's so fun
B000FA6720|5.0|This story touched me so deeply. I've seen the movie several times, but only now read the book. I believe we can all relate to the one who got away. Life is like that. That is what makes it all worthwhile. Beautiful example of true love. I cried through the last half of the story. Beautifully written. Thank you.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|My friends have iPads and are always talking about updates like survival mode and I get pissed that my android still has the original version
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Saw Harold and Maude in the 70's and it was just as I remembered.  Different than most movies but a story line worth watching.
B001BANK32|4.0|Stephen King is a master storyteller, and this one is very spooky. The characters are believable and it's scary. But there is an emotional center that makes me care for each of the characters.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|read the first book to appreciate the second of the trilogy. ken follet books are great. the narrative also weaves in the political climate in europe and russia.
B000FIMHLC|5.0|I only discovered these guys a few years ago after seeing the &#34;Oil City Confidential&#34; documentary, but man, am I glad I did! They rocked the blues like few others at a time when disco and punk were two &#34;hot&#34; genres.  Terrific album!
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|So glad that Todd has joined the band. This album is a non stop listen. Front to back, not a bad song on the disc. Buy.It.Now.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am a puzzle person &amp; have played all kinds on PC for more years than my PC's been talking to yours.  Since I'm new to the tablet world, I haven't got much to compare this to, but I'll bet I could search for years in the apps world &amp; never find anything half as good .
B00DGKQF2S|4.0|This album is very good . Billy is nutz on bass! Kotzon has good Cornell esc sounding voice. Which is very cool. Portnoy on drums doesn't hit his usual mark but still good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I loved the challenge of this game. I couldn't' couldn't  stop playing. I loved trying to figure out all of the puzzles to get to the next floor. Very challenging but yet not too hard that you just give up. I highly recommend.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|This is a great book from a great author. I have read  most of Mr. Rollins' books and they are all terrific.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|We have only watched the first three episodes.  Totally addicted to the season.  The characters keep you engaged and make you want to keep watching.  Every Sci Fi fan should watch.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Who doesn't love Gerald Butler?? This movie also made me a Hillary Swank fan! Great love story!! This will be a classic one day!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a great little game to play, to pass the time when bored. I like the real coin pusher at the arcade, this is just like, well in a way you dont get to win coin back. But it is still a fun little game to play.
B0090SI4OC|4.0|this is a teen movie, but if you like Sci-Fi you will like the concepts and some of the cinematography of this film. Yes its a chick flick too, but not too sappy, that dudes wont enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So i can not believe i never reviewd this and i read it 3 times since i got it 2 years ago. It was a great story, i know the movie is out and that that was good but the book is better, it always is. Katness shows that anyone can be a hero even if they are not trying to be one. it shows love in many ways as a community, as a family as a freindship and as a person. Thne fact that children must kill each other for sport is just the part of the story to keep you reading, which is sick but true. The story behide that is what makes these book so good and gripping to read.
B008220BP2|4.0|I love zombies, and this has a few twist that make it worth watching or owning for that matter. yes its a comedy ie shawn of the dead. but it is its own movie, with good acting, and thrilling.
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|It is an interesting diversion for an afternoon. Not the app of the year but a fun way to kill some time.
B00B769XB8|3.0|The acting is really cheesy, the graphics are amazing, the story is great, but unfulfilling overall. Some will disagree but i should have rented it instead of buying it, I feel asleep halfway through.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Martin knows how to write and this book was no exception. In the game of thrones no one is safe!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Great show!  That I keep trying not to watch because of it's negative theme of revenge, but it's oh so good.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|For fans of Sudoku, KenKen, CrossMe and similar games to these. I've always enjoyed games that make me think and use my brain to solve trying to keep my mind sharp. This is one of the of the best ones. You fill in the numbers 1-9 into the crossword-like puzzle without repeatingtje same number among the same column or row. Not all nine numbers are needes in each sum.<br /><br />Numbers on the bottom half of the clues indicate the sum needed  going down vs the clue on the upper side indicating the sum needed going to the right.<br /><br />The interface is great allowing you to see the full crossword at the same time with the option of zooming in and out if needed. I for one was very happy to see this one as faotd as it was one from my own wishlist. I think all number-puzzle loves will enjoy this one as well.<br /><br />The only thing I wish they had (or figured out how to do) is an option to turn off the option of the warning if you are over your sum or not. For example, if the sum is supposed to equal eight, then if the numbers you put in equal that the number eight will turn green otherwise it will turn red. Thay doesn't necessarily mean it's correct but I'd rather be able to turn off that option if possible to make it a bit more challenging.
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Great book; definitely worth the read. Some formatting issues when viewed on kindle for iPhone but I didn't find that it affected my experience.
1451695195|5.0|Well written and clear. Gives a good glimpse into life after death. The author has a good reason for telling the truth of hiks experience.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|They did it again! Even when they ended it, I was surprised and hooked. I love the way they developed different stories and events. I can't wait for season 4!
B000JIHP88|3.0|The bright colors and various shapes appeal to my grandson and the music volume is low enough to soothe and not excite.  I would like it better if there was a different selection of music - we usually just use the forest sounds - and if I could get the remote to operate.  Fresh batteries in the remote and adjusting the sensor on the main unit hasn't done the trick.
B008KP6ENE|4.0|this game is So so so so cool but it is not worth money I wish it was no money then I rate it a 5 star game
B00008G8LG|4.0|This presently is seen as the most vital of the story of Anna and her relationship with the King of Thailand.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As always Khaled Hosseini has woven truth with fiction to make an interesting read. I like the surprise twists and turns his stories take.
B000002L9J|5.0|If it's not the greatest album of all time, I would say it's very close. Released in June of 1986, The Queen Is Dead from The Smiths is one of the finest moments in music from the 80s. Produced by singer Morrissey and guitarist Johnny Marr, the record represents the band at their most powerful and profound. The album kicks off with the opening title track, which runs at 6 and a half minutes, and never stops. Morrissey's lyrics range from the satirical \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly\\" to the emotional \\"I Know It's Over\\" to the dark \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\" to the romantic \\"There Is A Light That Never Goes Out,\\" and it's all against the backdrop of fine instrumentation from Marr and the group. Despite its 37 minute running time, the size and scope of the record is enormous and continues to endure. Marr masters his attempt at somewhat reggae with \\"Cemetry Gates\\" and the elegant folk rock sensibilities of \\"The Boy With The Thorn In His Side\\" and even goes for a little 50s rock grove with \\"Vicar In A Tutu.\\" Much has been written about the album over the years and for good reason, it's a masterpiece. Entering at number 2 on the U.K. charts, only being beaten out by Peter Gabriel's So for the number 1 spot and being included on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time, what more proof do you need? A record that lives close to my heart and probably always will.

B008NCSZQ8|2.0|This movie could have been cut by at east 30 minutes or more. It seemed to drag on a bit too long.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|I have read quite a few of the reviews for MOS and they go from absolutely loving it to those who hated it. I saw it only once and my initial reaction was disappointment.I was hoping for something more. I've seen enough of Luthor and Zod, It would have been better to have Brainiac or Darkseid or even Bizarro. I know this is a superhero movie with \\"The Super Hero Of All Times\\". It would be nice to blend more story line with the action[ C.G.I. destruction of Metropolis.]I have seen IronMan3 and Star Trek and Man of Steel this Summer and frankly I am getting tired of all the destruction that has  been displayed on the screen.Sometimes less is more. Speaking of more the next movie will have Superman and Batman together. D.C. and Warner Bros. it is unfortunate that Marvel has left them in the dust. By the time they release a Justice League of America movie Marvel will probably be releasing Avengers 3! P.S. I am a Big Superman  Fan I am old enough to remember seeing the last few years of \\"The Adventures Of SuperMan\\" on it's initial airing. Good old George is my favorite M.O.S.

B0090SI4LU|3.0|You can feel the stamp of Stephenie Meyer (the 'Twilight' films) all over 'The Host' ... but at least here all parts of the triangle are at least human (well, mostly) - the story a bit more interesting than Bella's whining, as well.<br /><br />'The Host' opens on an Earth where human beings have all but been replaced by an alien species that can only survive by entering and taking over people, turning us all into emotionless, highly-intelligent drones.  The takeover is total, except in relatively few cases where the human host is actually strong enough to fight the invasion ... at least initially.  Sooner or later, though, it seems that everyone finally lets go as the alien fighting for control wins out.<br /><br />All, that is, except for Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan).  Part of an underground resistance movement comprised of a small band of humans, Melanie is out scouting with her kid brother and recently-acquired boyfriend Jared, when in order to save her brother she allows herself to be captured.  Immediately implanted, Melanie proves to be a formidable presence within her own body, refusing to relinquish control and even  at times taking over the thoughts and actions of the alien creature - named Wanda - inside her.  When the alien Seekers learn of Wanda's fight to get control, they tell her she'll be re-implanted the next day ... prompting Melanie to make Wanda, who is slowly learning to sympathize with the humans' plight, into running away before the Seekers can learn where the resisting humans - her only friends and family - are hidden.  The problem then not only becomes the Seekers in hot pursuit of Melanie/Wanda (including one, in particular, determined to find the humans), but for Melanie, how to also show up to her friends and family in hiding without getting killed, when they see she's \\"become\\" an alien host?<br /><br />Not a great movie, not a lot of great acting here, but the story and plot keeps enough momentum and suspense going to keep you watching, all of course requiring your suspension of belief ... but certainly not to the ludicrous extent that 'Twilight' similarly demanded.g, all of course requiring your suspension of belief ... but certainly not to the ludicrous extent that 'Twilight' similarly demanded.

B007JWKLMO|3.0|The information provided in this documentary is necessary for anyone who wants to know a little more about one the greatest human beings and musicans in the world, so it's worth the price.<br /><br />The disappointment is the extremely unbalanced level of volume throughout the DVD. The music attacks the viewer/listener with the gain being so much higher than the dialogues that one has to constantly fiddle with the volume on the remote control. George would never have allowed such an oversight.<br /><br />It's great to see that Patty has aged gracefully - she's still a beautiful woman. It is, however, a shame to hear her reading excerpts (from what I guess is her book) rather than her giving us that information during her all-too-short interview.<br /><br />And the very beginning of this documentary is a cheezy copy of the Beatles Anthology and I can't imagine George ever allowing a retread in any of his work. He was much to original for that sort of stuff.<br /><br />In the end, I am still glad I have the DVD even though its producers did George a disfavor by putting it together the way they did.

B009NG1Q96|4.0|Brief Summary:<br /> In the beginning of the Selection there was 35 girls competing to win over the Prince Maxon's heart and to be crowned the Princess of Illea but now it is down to the last 6 -- The Elite.<br /> America is still stuck between choosing who owns her heart. Being with Maxon is something new and exciting but then when she sees Aspen roaming around as a palace guard she can't help but think of the past they shared and that they both still want to have. With only 6 girls left there is only little time before America's time runs out to decide. Just when she is sure about her choice something huge happens and she starts to question everything again. What's worse is that the rebels are continuing to try and take down the monarchy and anyone with it.<br /><br /> My Take on the Book:<br /> Sooo ... I just looked at the release date and it says April 23 and I bought this about 3 days ago thinking -- Hey I just bought a new release on my tablet which I have never done. I usually wait about 6 months when it is a few dollars cheaper and within my budget -- However I was still late buying this. Damn I am slow.<br /> Ok so I wanted to love this book like the hundred times I imagined I would but I just couldn't. I basically devoured the thing in about and hour and then my initial thought was -- What the hell just happened?<br /> It could have been one of the 5 starer books but God she just kept stringing around those two guys like they were little puppies on a leash. Sooo I gave it a close 4. However I just can't help loving Maxon because whenever he would hurt America's poor feelings he went above and beyond to get her forgiveness.<br /> And good Lord no matter how much I tried to hate this book I just couldn't! Kiera Cass knew how to make me want to read and make me want more. Darn you Cass. Darn you. Be ashamed. Cause' I wanna yell at you for not giving us America's answer but then I wanna cry and beg forgiveness for not even yelling at you cause' I want you to hurry and come out with the last book.<br /> Ugh.<br /><br /> The Characters:<br /> America. So I looked around on Goodreads and saw that not many other reviewers liked America ... Yay. Now I won't look so bad when I pitch in my little America bash *giggles*<br /> Seriously though. I don't exactly hate her. I just dislike her character to the point where I want to grab her around the throat and give a firm shake while simultaneously yelling -- What the hell is your problem?! Just pick a damn guy already!<br /> Although I can't fully blame her. I think I may have had trouble picking between Aspen and Maxon though I probably would have picked faster and I would have been a princess by now *sigh*<br /> I do like America. I do. She is very loyal throughout the competition which you have to admit is stupid. You would be thinking -- Oh you petty petty girl. You don't play nice. That's not even legal here. -- BUT America is just that person who is naturally nice no matter the problem. Hmmm I think what I really liked was when her rebel side started to peek out and say \\"I'm here.!\\" Oh the joy of a girl to go bad.<br /> Maxon: *swoons* Maxon, Maxon, Maxon. Why can't you jump out your book and drag me from my animal crackers, can of Sprite, and book reviews and take me back to your world? You could trade me for Celeste? I'm sure she would fit perfect in high school. There is enough bitch to go around I promise (:<br /> Ok kidding kidding.<br /> Haha no.<br /> Maxon was so sweet and just cute. He was just the perfect guy and my heart broke every time I thought about how he didn't know about Aspen. Guys my heart is in little pieces ... I have to say Maxon may be my favorite character.<br /> Dang it was hard to not like Maxon but OMG I totally forgot you guys can have a reason not to like Maxon ... SPOILER COMING  close your eyes If you wish to be kept away from horrible nightmares and vomiting profusely and eyes being tortured and well just other gross stuff.<br /> ...............<br /> ...............<br /> ...............<br /> ...............<br /><br /> MAXON AND CELESTE FLIPPING MAKE OUT!!!!<br /><br /> Who all did not see that coming?<br /> *raises hand* Yeah me too!<br /> I take it back. He is not my favorite. Nope.<br /> But I still kinda love him.<br /><br /> Aspen. Ok call me odd for what I am about to write but I think Aspen isn't all for America. I think its partly like a race of some sort.<br /> Wait! Before you throw things at your computers that are meant for me I ask that you keep reading.<br /> So when America wants Aspen to back off were all like -- Yeah America you should be the one to pick not the other way around. -- Then Aspen cracks his grin and he's all like -- I see how it is. I'll just try harder because I will not lose to some Prince. You shall be mine. -- That is how I see it. Sorry if I hurt your feelings.<br /> *mentally gives you all candy for forgiveness*<br /> I know Aspen wants to be with America but he kinda ruined that chance in the first one so its pretty much -- Dude get over it. -- I feel as if he doesn't really care that America may have huge feelings for Maxon. He wants what he wants and if somebody else decide that they want what he wants that damn them.<br /><br /> Me Ranting:<br /> Kay' guys I am starting to give a crap about this whole love triangle stuff. But I want it. But I hate it. You guys know how I feel right?<br /> I will just pretend ya'll nodded your pretty little heads.<br /> I can't tell you how many times I read the non spoiler reviews about how much they loved the book but oh-so-hated America cause all she did was string along the two guys and I'm sitting in my room thinking -- Nooo she wouldn't do that. It's obvious that she will and I mean WILL pick Maxon -- Uh no.<br /> Sorry ladies the other rich readers who get the book during the release date were oh-so-right.<br /> Eh it happens to the best of us.<br /> God I would be reading a scene with her and Maxon and be all -- OMG I know she will pick him! She is so happy and he is in freaking love with her! She will be crowned PRINCESS! *squeals*-- Then oh about 20 pages or so later its -- Woe is me, Maxon is spending time with the rest of the Elite and I am stuck in my room. I should go look for Aspen -- *smacks face with tablet*<br /> America oh America. When will you ever learn? He is only doing this because he has to! In the end he keeps coming back to you!<br /> Grrrrr. Yes I did just growl.<br /> But my fellow readers this love triangle thing seems to be the `new' thing. The heart wants what the heart wants.<br /> When I write my own book someday I shall determine a love hexagon to be the next `new' thing. And it shall be done. *claps twice*<br /> Oooh in the next book I want to see more of the Queen. In this one what we saw made me think -- You know the Queen may have been a rebel herself back in the day. No wonder she likes America so much.<br /> And the King? All I must say is ...<br /> You sir are a douche bag.<br /> That is all.<br /><br /> Guys my mom is getting Donuts. Its 5 AM here and I think my rant is now over.

B0089X38EU|5.0|I was very happy to have the opportunity to purchase it as I didn't really know it was available.  I have played it dozens of times since I received it.  I purchased two of them so I could give one as a gift.  The recipient will have to be someone who appreciates and loves it as much as I do!
B00BG0RSJ4|5.0|I've watched finding nemo for over half my life and it is by far one of my favorite movies of all time - in child and adulthood
B00A8ECU24|5.0|The best game i got on my tablet im positive that you will love it give it a try :)
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|AT first I thought how could the movie be bad for who is in it. Wrong ! Sadly I think the actors  got paid but the move is a bomb. I got tired of every sentence starting out with  JACK can you hear me, JACK are you there , Jack come back, Jack look out, jack this jack that  jack off !  I enjoy Tom C but not in this movie.  Wow Tom C produced it also what a flop !
B00280LYHS|4.0|Good series overall. I would recommend it to anyone interested in mythology or fantasy in general, just don't watch the movie!
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I love this game it's really fun. I gave this game to my cousins 4 year old baby and she really loved it. I recommend everyone to buy it for your kids.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a fun game for the whole family to play my kids n I love to play n they love the movie I can't say anything bad about it
1490313370|1.0|This book just isn't very good.  It appears to be a rambling collection of blog articles rather than a cohesive book.  I only bought it because of the money back guarantee.  Now I found it that they are not refunding money until September ... or so they say.  If they default on the refund, it will be class action suit time.
B009X010RU|3.0|Not what I though it be. Case too thin and soft for carting on crowed mass transit. New York subway too ruff.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I had so many friends who would talk about Downton Abbey and I thought, &#34;Yea, just another trend.&#34;  Then one night I was out of things to watch on &#34;summer tv&#34; and decided to use my Prime to watch something free and decided, okay, I'll try Downton Abbey.  I started with Season 1, stayed up late, late nights and was shocked and moved by the Season finale of Season 3.  I wanted to watch Season 4, only there wan't one.  I would highly recommend the series.
159463176X|5.0|Beautifully written and reaches deep into the human soul.  Pay attention to the fable at the beginning of the book; everything else is a variation on that theme, much like a Bach variation.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Used to love this app. Then someone decided to get artsy and change the menu format, now it not only looks crappy but is not user friendly either. Just another example of if it's not broken don't fix it. Thanks designer person /team for ruining the looks and function of what used to be an excellent app. Time to delete the Weather Channel app and find a better weather app.
B007N8RULO|5.0|Excellent application. Easy to use.  Be forewarned that this application is addictive and you start you may not get much work done.<br /><br />Recommended.
B0064MGU98|5.0|It is a well done show and has a good and interesting storyline.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the inaccurate reflection of Chicago at times - but that is probably only because I live here...it is also little things and is there for story purposes...
B002ZM74Y6|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time! The acting is just superb. Though DeNiro was superb, Liotta, Pesce and Bracco were even better and stole the movie. Scorsese made it all work. If you like mob movies this competes with the Godfather.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My favorite app Its just like subway surfers.My favorite part is the Vector and Meena battle I've beet both of them  It should be100 dollars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! also you collect bananas.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I purchased this boxed set for my grandchildren.  Fortunately, they lead active lives and don't spend all that much time in front of a TV, but they will eventually get around to enjoying Indiana's adventures.  The &#34;Gold Box&#34; price of this item was too good to pass up.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love it sometimes when I go to visit my cousin me and her play it at the same time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I started using this video and about halfway through you can see a difference if you are also trying to eat healthier and putting 100% effort into wanting to get fit.  I still do this video in the mornings and use one of her longer videos for my evening workout.  I feel great and have so much more energy now.
B003H9M1QM|5.0|Dumbo Blu-ray was ON TIME.  The Picture is PERFECTION! The details,  Marvelous!  ALL AGES can watch the QUALITY of Blu-ray!  My favorite Movie (except Fantasia) of Disney's.  Thank You Amazon.com !

B00BMVTS1S|1.0|i did really like this movie, it was kinda boring and reallt didnt have a good plot, i will not recommend this movie
0201485672|5.0|It is interesting to read the book and learn how to do refactoring. The book is well written and super!
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|I loved this movie and thought it was very awesome, i recommend it to all my friends and family to watch
B007SGM084|3.0|After hearing about this series for over a year I was so excited to finally buy it and read it. I must say for as scandalous as I had heard it to be I was rather disappointed when i actually finished all 3 books. The first one started slow and had very little creativity in it. The wiritingwas less than desirable and the main female character was rather whiny. The second book had a few interesting parts but the writing was still rather drab. By the third book the only reason i read it was to complete the series. The third book skipped around and it was hard to follow whether it was today, tomorrow or 2 weeks from the event that happend. The ending really skipped around and was in the past then 4 years in the future. It was rather upsetting and frustrating. I hope that they do not make a movie out of this, it would be a waste of money
0425263924|3.0|I have read the hardback of this series for the second time trying to understand where the author is going with this story. I think I don't want to wait almost two years before I know the ending to this love story. She had her readers by the balls with the first two books, we were all supporting her and her talent. We have plenty time now to explore other writers and their talents in erotic romance.<br />Let's see who will have the next great story of all times.<br />I hope when the next books come out to complete this series, that Gideon and Eva will still be fresh on their mind.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|At first I had trouble opening this app and it force closed itself a lot, but I uninstalled an reinstalled it and it works perfectly! I love this game! it's my favorite app.(:
B006QPX7UI|5.0|Just a great film, acting is fantastic, I watch this film every year around the anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg to remember the sacrifices so many made to preserve the Union
B006JRIZJG|4.0|This was purchased for my 3 year old daughter. I love that she can store all her barbie dolls inside & when shebis ready to play,  she unzips the box, makes her house, and all her Barbies are there. No more searching through the big toy box to dig out the dolls. The box itself is a little flimsy & she sometimes has trouble zipping it by herself bc one zipper sticks . The handles make it very easy for her to move from room to room on her own. Overall,  it was a great purchase.
B000W746GK|5.0|No complaints on this one.  I think everyone likes Harry Potter...adults and children alike.  I am enjoying this movie.<br />I am in a nursing home and these movies helped to fill my days.
B00CL151G4|5.0|This is an extremely well written and even better acted drama, and as a Sherlock Holmes adaptation it is very compelling.  The portrayal of Holmes as a recovering addict is groundbreaking, probably the best portrayal of addiction and recovery on television.  And this Watson is perfect.  She's not a sidekick or a secondary character, but brilliant in her own right, and a co-protagonist.  And the roles are amazingly played by Jonny Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.  It's a shame Lucy Liu didn't get an Emmy nod; overlooking Jonny Lee Miller's masterful performance was a crime.<br /><br />The cases are sometimes weak, but character development, particularly the friendship between Sherlock and Watson, is the true focus of the show.  If you like Sherlock Holmes, if you like detective shows, if you like exceptionally well-written and well-acted television, then you will love Elementary.
B000W796OM|5.0|All of the Harry Potter movies are exciting and I enjoy watching each one of them (I have them all).
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The people are interesting & original. The history is captivating. I can see why they got such rave reviews. Can't wait to continue watching the series.
B000FQJAIM|2.0|I have written to you already about my dissatisfaction with 4 of the Star Wars movies I ordered through Amazon and have gotten no response from the vendor or any satisfaction from you.<br /><br />I ordered Star Wars Episode I, II, III, IV, V and VI.  Out of all of these, I got 2 episodes that I was satisfied with (Star Wars Episodes III and V.  The others (I, II, IV and VI) all contain closed captioning that cannot be turned off.  This is not acceptable and quite frankly is having a negative affect on my ordering other things from you.<br /><br />Please offer some kind of resolution.

Do you devote a frustrating, soul-draining amount of time playing cheerleader, trying to get others to CHOOSE YOU/?<br /><br />If so, then entrepreneur, author, and shameless free thinker James Altucher has a message for you:<br />&#34;Stop letting other people draw up the blueprints for your life and.. CHOOSE YOURSELF.&#34;<br /><br />Far from being a manual on how to perform acts of self-centered douchebaggery, Choose Yourself is instead a refreshing entreaty to those who are shackled by conventional ideas about jobs, security, happiness, self-esteem, and finding a &#34;true purpose.&#34;<br /><br />&#34;Forget purpose,&#34; writes Altucher. &#34;It's okay to be happy without one.  The quest for a single purpose has ruined many a life.&#34;<br /><br />This oddly engaging,  schizophrenic book is part raw confessional (&#34;I'm an addict.  For twenty years I replaced one addiction with another,  I couldn't even describe all of them.&#34;,) part business book (&#34;negotiation is worthless, sales are everything) and when describing the &#34;Daily Practice&#34; Choose Yourself morphs into a kind of new age self-help tome.<br /><br />Yet, in spite of that, or perhaps because of it, Choose Yourself is also extremely thought-provoking and hopeful, even when Altucher refuses to sugarcoat the inconvenient truths of today's world<br /><br />&#34;The fact is- your bosses hate you.  That's right- they hate you.  You created more and more value.  They paid you less and less.  That's the definition of disdain in my book, &#34; says Altucher, who encourages readers to knock down their cubicles and fire their masters.&#34;<br /><br />Truth is sometimes uncomfortable and alarming, but the truth dished out in Choose Yourself is also refreshing and inspirational.  I started the book feeling depressed and pessimistic.  I finished it with a renewed sense of hope and a burning desire to start choosing myself as soon as possible.

B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a great game for kids. The only thing that I don't like about games like this one is that in the long run it is much more expensive to play than going to the store and buying a game for 50 bucks.

B0058RCVYS|3.0|I am usually a huge fan of these northern Europe movies for they usually have a delicious weird vibe when addressing relationship issues or society issue, and it is very refreshing. Not in this movie, and this is my main complain. Everything in this movie is a basic cliché, from the so neo-colonialist vision of the Indian orphanage to the greedy young son-in-law, to the filthy rich guy trying to control everyone's life, even to the plot... clichés are everywhere, and it ruins it all.<br />Also, very little time is actually given to develop the psychology of the characters after the big news comes, which would have been interesting.<br /><br />This movie is OK. Just OK. Yes there are some nice emotional moments, but yes they are predictable. From the way it is directed to the acting, it is totally a northern Europe movie like Danish and Swedish like to produce. Again, not an outstanding performance, but probably different enough from US movies to leave an impression on whoever isn't used to watch stuff that isn't Hollywood.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie.

B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google has done it again! Chromecast is a handy product that lives up to the Google name. Works great and is well worth the $35 it costs. My videos stream flawlessly from my phone onto my tv making me feel like I have a smart tv. The video's stream in HD and with no loss of definition. Youtube, Netflix, and Google Play videos are all compatible! The feature I love the most about Chromecast is that I can browse other apps while using it and my videos aren't even interrupted! I highly recommend Chromecast to anyone who wants a smart tv without paying the price for getting one.

B00CXQL828|5.0|The group-members have the ability to play much more complex material however this album makes the listener drive faster to their next destination and/or gets the party started. Not a bad song on the record.  The &#34;pocket&#34; provides great sound for some killer leads, percussion-rhythm guitar areas give chance for great bass-leads, and Portnoy playing in a 3-piece band is way cool.....he shines and looks happy!<br /><br />If you are a expecting Dream Theater sound , go buy a Dream Theater album.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|(WARNING: SPOILER ALERT)Only read the first bit if you haven't seen the movie yet.<br /><br />I like this movie, and I'm surprised that people don't like it or are even bashing it like it's the worst anime in the world. Everyone is different...hell I have a friend who is in love with High School Musical...I honestly don't care because she's her own person. Not every anime is for everyone I'm going to buy this movie because I'm a sucker for good animation. This movie is really impressive in that aspect. Along with the animation I just have to say that the plot is not nearly as bad as people are suggesting.<br />I guess what I'm trying to say is...this move isn't for everyone so go borrow it from Netflix or watch it on Youtube before you buy it.<br /><br />This movie had characters that a person could seriously relate to, Sonoshee's dream is to race in Redline...since most people missed it I'll explain how this is really relateable. If you participate in any sport and take it very seriously than you can understand the longing to reach the top, espcially in individual sports. This is the relateability that I'm getting at. As for JP's story...I understand the disappointment. He's basically a buffoon chasing a girl around and trying to prove himself by racing along side her. Though this may be pretty lame...people in the real world do it all the time and it really humanizes the character...Sure you have a main character who is a love struck punk with an added passion for his sport, but I think that's really what adds to his character. He's basically just your average Joe...just like almost every male on this planet, he's just a guy. As for the futuristic setting and lack of back story regarding it's existence, I like the way you have to pay close attention and figure things out on your own. Your brain has got to think fast in order to truly understand the setting in it's entirety. The more you pay attention the more you will understand. I think any good movie should havethat aspect. A good example (Feeding of the remark made by D. Thomas) I'm pretty sure the cars have some sort of futuristic four wheel steering (But it's only an assumption). These are futuristic cars, who's to say they can't make 90 degree turns? I mean hell, Sonoshee's car didn't even have wheels.

B00506NRBS|5.0|I love this book!  Derek writes with humor, and his words flow like silk.  I am recommending this book on my blog especially for anyone starting or planning to start a business.  Derek's message is straight forward:  do what feels right for you.  Do it in a way that you enjoy.  Take ownership of your own business (and of your life, your brand, your identity,your personality etc). Do this in a way that serves other people, and preserves quality.

1612680011|2.0|I have read several of Robert Kiyosaki's books. Be warned Rich Dad Poor Dad is a light introduction to the world of business with very little meat and substance. All of Kiyosaki's books read like motivational speeches without expanding any of his main ideas in any kind of depth. If you read one you have basically read them all. There is an abridged copy of this work but I can't understand why because a teenager could understand his simple writing style.<br /><br />Disappointment eventually sets in with Kiyosaki. Way too many products and not enough to say. Robert never quite expands his basic ideas and tells you what to do. For the most part, his basic explanation of things like his cashflow quadrant work but aren't particularly insightful. If you took an accounting or economics course, you should probably already know most of this info anyway. After reading 5 Kiyosaki books I must admit to being disappointed. I was sure excited about this title along with everyone else 10 years ago (I am now a small business owner) but I'm not going to give more credit than is due. Robert is primarily a motivational writer.<br /><br />Rich Dad Poor Dad is Robert's best book. If you are starting out and want to know the basics of starting a business, learning about real estate and investing in a very light way then check this out. It's a very light but interesting read. Not everything will be accurate for your situation. Little to nothing substantial is actually revealed in any of Kiyosaki's books. They seem like advertisements to purchase more product for him. Ultimately I realized Robert is a great motivational speaker but he is not the person who can teach you anything substantial about business. He pumps you up and sends you off in his franchise. He was merely a stepping stone to better business authors. I improved my net worth and cashflow since I read this in 2001 but I would credit Anthony Robbins not Robert Kiyosaki.<br /><br />On August 20, 2012, one of Kiyosaki's companies, Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy in Wyoming Bankruptcy Court. For a real business book, check out Awaken the Giant Within or The E-Myth Revisited., Rich Global LLC, filed for bankruptcy in Wyoming Bankruptcy Court. For a real business book, check out Awaken the Giant Within or The E-Myth Revisited.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|And I did, too.  I can see a little why it got bad reviews and did poorly at the box office, but I ended up enjoying it more so than I thought I would.  Overall, the story and action were better than some other crap that's come out lately.
1612680402|2.0|Buy Rich Dad Poor Dad for a business introduction by the same author. It has almost the exact same information.<br />Retire Young Retire Rich is ultimately too wordy, repetitive and light to be of much value. The same examples are repeated throughout.<br />Like many people, I was hoping Robert would expand on his basic ideas in Rich Dad Poor Dad. Alas, he never does because he is more of a motivational speaker than business writer. This is just barely passable. The basic information and underlying theme are worthwhile for those just getting their feet wet in business. Be warned that Kiyosaki really has nothing to sell or say; he's a motivational writer. That doesn't prevent him from creating dozens of books and programs based on his ideas.<br />If you want a real business or self-improvement book, check out Awaken the Giant Within by Anthony Robbins.

0887307280|4.0|After hearing great things about The E-Myth for years I picked up a copy. Amazingly, this 1995 work remains relevant by offering smart advice in a fun narrative. It truly is an \\"underground bestseller.\\" This is most appropriate for small, storefront businesses, professional services, franchises and retail businesses.<br /><br />I had been running a small business for 3 years at the time and was quite impressed and delighted at the lessons Gerber imparted in this text. He writes in a very compelling style. He has plenty of good advice without being too dry yet keeps the story moving along at a brisk pace. The business lessons are imparted through a character in the book who is trying to expand her small business. This book teaches you how to think and act like a business owner, which is a very different mindset from that of an employee. Much more practical than Robert Kiyosaki's Rich Dad Poor Dad series or just about any business book on the market. I implemented many of the suggestions in my own venture and took it to the next level before selling it and doing another successful start-up.<br /><br />One of the reasons this book is still in the conversation was the use of the main character, Sarah, to get the reader to identify with the trials of a young business owner. I found myself smirking many times. If you are self-employed you can relate to much of this and will appreciate the wisdom of Gerber. He knows what he's talking about and this is Gerber's best book.<br /><br />I read this on vacation in Europe and quite enjoyed it. Buy this book.
B000XPOB0M|2.0|It is always nice to watch a bigger budget horror flick for so many reasons like in this case the acting by Swank and her co-stars plus the locations. The locations in The Reaping help add an eerie feel to this story and include a gorgeous plantation estate, old cemetery, the town and the way to cool and creepy swamp. The story isn't new, but the premise twist is newer with the girl and her mother and her followers and the debunking of miracles and the unexplained using science to explain the chain of events is pretty cool.<br /><br /> In the last few years we have been inundated with paranormal investigation works that try to either prove or disprove the existence of ghosts, spirits, possessions and demons via science and scientific equipment. This movie predates most of those works and may have helped to bring the genre to life? I don't know, but its just a thought. Anyway, back to the movie.<br /><br />The story is solid and brings Swank's characters story development full circle starting with her faith, families work in Sudan, the tragic loss and then her metamorphosis into a scientist thats mission in life is to debunk miracles and the unexplained.  The LSU peofessor (Swank) and her former grad student (Elba) are called upon to investigate the anomalies in and around the small town of Haven, La. Swank and Elba start their investigation just after they arrive in Haven. They do not use much in the area of equipment to help support their scientific theory or to help reinforce the story for the viewer.<br /><br /> Many of the towns residents are convinced that they know the cause of the plague like events and what is behind them.  Morrissey's character (Doug) is not as covinced as the rest of the town and is the one who contacted Swank's character at the begining of the story. The mayor and town council don't want to waste time waiting for the scientific test results to come back to take action, so the pressure is on. The atheist scientist Vs. the bible toting mayor and town council chomping at the bit to take matters into their own hands to stop evil.<br /><br />The movie has so much going for it as mentioned before, but the story lacks any real edge of your seat or nail bitting scare the pants of you feel to it. I hoped that between the swamp as a backdrop and the good acting this movie would have been good. Maybe the story was so well laid out that it was to revealing and nothing was left to the imagination or that all the biblical plagues scenarios have become to obvious and or over used? Whatever the reason this movie missed its mark as a scary horror film. The lack of any real tension, fear, scary scenes or lack of any grotesque figures or to a lesser degree gore turned this movie into a after school movie for all ages.<br /><br /> Please don't get me wrong? I don't need a lot of gore, sex or nudity to be present in a movie for it to be good and scary. What I do require is a good creepy story, good acting and direction and creatures or people that are seen or not that are either visually striking or their perceived scary from good writing that sitmulates the imagination and if the story requires blood, gore, drugs, sex and rock \\"n\\" roll then thats ok too. I did not go into to much detail with my review so I wouldn't spoil the story for you.<br /><br />Was this movie as waste of time to watch? No. not by a long shot. The acting and scenic beauty alone are worth the time. Was this a scary movie? No, not at all, but the effects and locations do add a little creepiness to the story. Is this a family time movie? Yes, it is with its lack of non stop cursing and very little in the sex department and NO T & A, but a touch of sensuality in one or two scenes (flashes of love making without t & a) that shows belly button area. The movie also limits blood and gore to a minimum with the exception of the blood red river/lake scenes. The bodies are not covered in blood. There is little in the way of violence except for the mob sceneswith guns. They do show scenes of a stack of dead cows being burned in a trench and buried. I will rate this at 2 stars or 3 for the acting and swamp and cemetery locations.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I had to hit the walk-through once or twice, but even when I did I discovered I was right on track and just wasn't  ranging far enough through the available territory or wasn't taking into consideration the idea that another search might be set up in an area I'd recently been through.  It took me several days to finish this game (not full  time, obviously.)  Hard enough to be challenging and intuitive enough to be fun!  More, please!  The only reason I rated this four stars is that for a couple of the puzzles I couldn't figure out how to get a clue to the numeric or word code that would open the box or lock even by studying the notes and evidence.  That may be my failing and not the game's, so take that into account.
B00COHAUD4|2.0|Mama's story starts out a little different to say the least and when the pieces of the puzzle come together about the girls life in the cabin for the past five years it gets so unbelievable. I like stories that are new and different as long as they work. If you add up all the WTH's in this story you just have to laugh at its wacked out storyline and plot holes. If I go into any detail I will spoil the movie for you and I don't want to do that to you. The story is very unique and I will give it credit for that however it is not well thought out nor is it well executed in the movie. Lets just say there is just to many unbelievable WTH moments like some of the characters, story, plot and actions taken by some of the cast. Was this worth the time to watch? Yes. Was it scary? No, but I did get a jump out of one scene that wasn't predictable out of the many many others that were predictable. The cgi was ok, but the figure was a little to cheesy for me along with the many over used body positions and stances. Was it gory? Not at all nor was it very violent or contained any sexual content. The movie does have some good production values like camera work, acting, locations and decent direction, but again the story is just to far out their unless I was watching some kind of fantasy story instead of a horror flick. 2 stars
B0064MGU98|5.0|Started watching, as it was recommended by friends. It is really a great show..and I would recommend it to others
B000J1AGQI|4.0|I have watched this movie several times for a few reasons that include the strong brotherhood representation that is so critical to our warriors, sailors, airmen/women, coast guard, cops and firefighters. The inclusion of the wives/girlfriends and their emotional gut wrenching roller coaster ride of terror, grief, hope, lose and the fear of the unknown. The story also includes a look into the eyes, hearts and minds of the enemy in a way that is seldom done and is viewed from a human perspective instead of a non or sub human perspective.<br />I also like to watch this because its so well made from every angle and after some investigation I found the story to be more factual than not and without the all to familiar over the top hollywood BS. I'm sure that some of the hollyweird junk did make its way into the movie, but again to a lesser degree.<br />It always pulls at my heart strings when I watch this movie  and when I watch them fly away from that battlefield and the NVA return after all the bloodshed I keep asking WHY? I know the answer, but I don't like it. The engagement was a test for a new unproven style of fighting tactics and as a test to size up the enemy and its capabilities.<br />The movie does a good job of giving you get an idea (but from the safety of your home) of the intensity, confusion, fear, tension (and the list is much to long to post here) and the feeling of impending doom of being overrun that they were going through, albeit a little tension and a quickend pulse rate. The movie can't test the viewers metal to see if you can handle war or succumb to the horrific and tramatic effects it has on the mind and body, but it can and does give the viewer a glimpse into the chaos that is unfolding all around you. I like war movies for some of the previously mentioned reasons and in part because of my age and growing up with so many of them that involved the Revolutionary war, The Alamo, American Indian wars, The Civil war, The Spanish American war, WWI and WWII, the Korean war and the Vietnam war, Granada, Desert Storm (Iraq I), Iraq II and the Afganistan wars.<br />When I was growing up the wars were glamorized and romanticized until the Vietnam war and its polarizing effects that led to our countries disgraceful treatment of our Vietnam Vets. This is one person that was sicken by the treatment of the guys (girls) I knew and the many many many more that I didn't know. Thankfully my dad was a WWII Vet and he and my mom taught me better than that. They taught me that whether you are for or against any war that you support those who will lay down their lives for this country!!! Sorry for the rant, but its close to my heart.<br />If you are looking for a closer to the truth or factual war movie (Vietnam) that is incredably well produced that delves into tactics, comraderie, wives perspective, helicopters, napalm, air strikes, survival and a whole lot more? Then this is a must see movie that delivers on so many levels

B005KYL9LK|5.0|A post-apocalyptic vision of a man without memory, alienated from others and ultimately from himself.  Lynch as a student of film outside the mainstream paints a portrait of the ugliness and bleakness of a modern Western culture cut off from the past centuries.  The woman in the radiator reminds us of outsider portraits of the shadow self of Marilyn Monroe.  She sings a haunting hymn:  &#34;heaven is a place where you've got yours and I've got mine&#34; describes a longing for material means, but devoid of meaningful relationships or purpose.

I want to know if the 3D Blu-ray is region coded, it is not specified as region specific whereas on others like Beauty and the Beast it states region. Will I be able to play it in a UK Blu-ray player?
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This is a really fun game. I would recommend this game to everyone. I can play this game for hours. You should try it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game kept me thinking without being frustrating. I really enjoyed it an can not wait for more levels. if you have some free time and want a challenge without frustration,  you will enjoy this game.
B00CWV8X04|4.0|The story is intrinsically interesting, and on another level it's fun to watch several Hollywood tropes get bulldozed as it unfolds. I'm pleasantly surprised a movie like this could still be made.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. Changes all the time:) I play several times a day. Building on puzzle gives you more coins and that means more plays.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|First of all, his name is pronounced Hu-lay.  This is the first Harry Hole novel.  There are still some which have not been translated I understand.  They are all suspenseful and very well written.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I love being able to shop on-line for great prices for great music and having it delivered to my door.
1476733953|4.0|Read this book, thought it was great. I love how the author does such an excellent job of showing versus telling. He really brings the whole place alive, the characters alive. (I'm taking notes!). I really liked every character in this book, especially Juliette - and except Bernard.<br /><br />The only con about this book, and the reason I gave it four stars instead of five, is because there were times when the showing versus telling was too lengthy. I actually found myself skipping paragraphs at first, then whole pages! just to get to the part of the chapter where something was actually happening. A perfect example where I think I skipped like 2-3 pages of showing material was in Juliette's diving descent to fix the water problem. So much talk, and thoughts and description of everything...not enough action and doing, and plot moving forward.<br /><br />Anyway, that's my only complaint. This guy, Hugh Howey, is obviously a skilled writer and this book is totally worth reading.
B006LXQID8|4.0|Interesting movie. A little odd and strange but quirky as well (in a good way). I recommend it to those who like odd yet happy weird movies
B005KJZDXK|5.0|My wife loves all kinds of Christmas music, and this was one she requested.  We love Zooey's quirkiness.  Her lovely voice is a bonus!
1869504917|4.0|... but this is not quite it, though duly interesting in its own right.This is a very nice book, with glossy pages and color pictures, from the NZ locations and from the film, but I thought it would be more Maps-and-Directions and thing like addresses and such as that. However, it does have lots of nice little details enough, and is sufficient.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|My wife loves all types of Christmas music, and Annie Lennox adds a bit of class to my wife's collection!
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Not what I expected,not a big fan of it,but had to have for one of my games that I play,so with said,if you get this remember it will boot you off your Facebook,when trying to play your games.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game could not be more addictive. I'm going back through and trying to get three stars on all of the courses. Lots of fun!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I could not put the book down. It is a love story between two people who thought they were not good enough for each other.
B0058RN85O|5.0|One of the greatest comedy series on TV.  Every episode is great and full of laughs.  It's a show you can enjoyably re-watch and enjoy again and again.
1419701533|5.0|This was a gift for my seven year old grandson. It was such a hit. He devoured them. I look to foster a love of reading and this was a great success.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I look forward to more of this pair's music.  The album has a solid mix of great songs with only a few that I didn't really care for.  It's definitely worth owning.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|Absolutely my favorite movie of all time. Dr. Hunter s. Thompson wrote an amazing book and this movie is a spot on representation of that book. Johnny Depp is amazing in the role as well as Benicio Del Toro. A+
B000OXHRRC|3.0|Great story, but do not expect the book.  The location is is beautiful. .The plot is good and the acting fair.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very good and easy to learn and if you like this yu should try angry gran run or subway surfers also very good games the items you earn are very cheap to earn he average first time is 100 to 300 coins and he stuff only costs 150 the first time
B009GX7IRA|3.0|Great show but needs to evolve. Great cast and I would like to see more exploration and further development of the individual characters. It would be nice to see some characters move on or retire rather than die in the line of duty, etc.
1451613512|5.0|Was history a bore for you in school? Lost at figuring out what has happened to our country? Turn the Tunnel Vision (TV) off and read this one. It is the first 600 pager that I have had to read twice to completely absorb. History is nothing more than similar events playing over and over again. - only the names change. Want to predict the future - study an unvarnished account of the past. Wall-Streeter abuses, war profiteering, banksters, 1920s supply side economics and puppet machine politicians all depend on the public's forgetfulness of painful memories to replay their same abuses and schemes. This is not the political correct BS that you were taught in school - lets call it reality history. Not a flag waver, not an America hater - just explanations  that have motivations and agendas by participants - just as in life. Everyone who has ever worked for a living had better study Roosevelt's New Deal legislation that gave 40 hour work week, vacations, weekends and retirements. Knowledge is a very powerful tool - reading has become the only way really &#34;prep&#34; yourself. Stop working on your bunker for events that might happen and read about events that have happened and continue in your name by our leaders and those that whisper in their ears. Footnoted for the detail orientated who might want further to do further research or verification. This book will connect the dots for many readers and is time well spent.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I enjoyed this book and I can recommend it.  It was considerably better than many of the books that I've read so far this year (14).  The story was very interesting and the ending was good, and unexpected.  It was a good page-turner.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is very useful.  Tech support is amazing.. Very easy to understand.. I am so glad I tried it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great characters.  I wouldn't want to hang with these guys, but a very smart group.  Lots of twists and the satisfaction of seeing the guys who deserve it the most....get there comeuppance.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really enjoyed Cheryl and her story of hiking the PCT. I would highly recommend this book. Inspiring and strong.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|Dune is one of my all time favorite books.  I was so happy to find it available on Kindle.  I will be looking to purchase Children of Dune as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing and it completely explains the minions personality and the despicable me movies. I like how they are addicted to the bananas in both the movies and the game.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love the show and the characters.  I can't wait for the next season and even the one after that!
B00B5BX6LI|4.0|Great voice, well worth the money. With that great an artist, how can you go wrong? brings back memories of his show
140006922X|2.0|The negative reviews here get attacked as \\"fundamentalists\\", but I think the problem with the positive reviewers haven't spent years reading real revisionist Biblical scholarship so this seems \\"new.\\" The author contributes not an original sentence to the decades long effort to rationally analyze the Gospels--he just copies the scholarship that most resembles his worldview and presents it as new. For those who prefer scholarship to axe-grinding in their scholarship, try the Jesus Seminar's book on the Gospels, or Bart Ehrman. (And I'm an atheist, not some Fundamentalist.)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I am addicted to these mystery/puzzle/object games. Enigmatis: The Ghosts of Maple Creek is the best one I've played so far! It has interesting, smooth graphics and movement. The storyline is entertaining, and there are many different locations. This is no more easy or difficult than others in this genre, but it is put together very well, and I enjoyed it. I am looking forward to the sequel.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|This app is awesome!!! They have so many different themes, they have a ninja, Easter, Halloween, space, soccer, under the sea, jungle, winter, arctic, and a ghost level. They also have the regular level shock you can get for free. My favorite is the soccer and the winter. I also like the Easter theme. I recommend this to everyone. [...]Thank you. I recommend this app!!!!
B00932AA5G|5.0|Great movie. Suspenseful and will not disappoint. The storyline and cinematography is fantastic. This will get remade into an American movie like all great European cinema.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This was a gift. A very easy case to use. It is very light weight. The color is very vivid.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't get enough of this game! So addicting! I hope there's more. Is there a second version coming out soon? I really hope so
B005IZLPMY|5.0|This is an incredible movie. Lots of action. Having the DVD gives me the availability to watch the movie again
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've read the first book in a day and immediately started reading this one.<br /><br />This book is unpudownable lol.<br /><br />Katniss is just a girl caught in the middle of a revolution without even knowing the role she plays in the this story.<br /><br />When her little life is almost going back to normal,she has to go back to the arena. Just that this time she is more mature and so are her interests.<br /><br />There is much more in risk than just her life.<br /><br />This is a masterpiece. Brilliant, dynamic, well written and catches the attention of the readers at every turn of the page.<br /><br />I recommend it not only to younger readers but to anyone young at heart who is interested in good entertainment.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter. She has enjoyed the DVD's and plays them often. They are great videos.
B00CJGP116|5.0|What I like most about Marc Anthony is that you can hear all kinds of opinions about which is his best album. From Otra nota to 3.0. For me personally Libre is his best album, although I understand why any other would be selected for his best album. I saw too many negative comments, considering the quality of album is it. I want to say that this is not salsa dura, the arrangements are not that complex, improvisations are short and percussion are not on focus. Obviously, to date Marc Anthony believes that simple is true. However, for me this is the deepest album of Marc.<br />This album is not for salsa purists!<br />Marc has always done what he considered right and satisfying. It's his conception of things, but even in a \\"radio version\\" (as mentioned in a previous review), it's salsa and made in right way. We talk about a very talented people who are related to this music.<br />Marc still sets the bar. And he is alone.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter. She has enjoyed the DVD's and plays them often. They are great videos.
B007SGM084|5.0|A must read can't wait for the movie... hope they don't mess it up like they do with so many books , all three have to be great
B005LAIGTG|5.0|This is a great movie. Having the DVD gives the ability to watch the movie over and over again. Great
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game I could play it all day! It passes Time easily! And fun for kids,adults,preteens,there's fun for everyone :D I recommend this game:)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game great way to get the best of knowledge about horses. Grandkids love it. The graphics are great. Would recommend this game to families.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I like how it keeps me busy. Plus I enjoy taking care of animals. :) hd Dutch  u  u  if if it  ii
B009G78EE2|5.0|Love it. I generally tend towards blues and pop music and dislike rap, yet somehow I love this music, and not just Thrift shop.
159562015X|5.0|These TENS pads have better adhesive than the ones I get at the DEM store, meaning I can use the longer and not have to reorder so often.  They also seem to distribute the current more evenly than ones I've used before.
B004VDSWQ6|5.0|This is truly a mesmerizing and incredible performance from start to finish. Simply stunning in all aspects, camera work, production, vocals, and band all really on the top of their game! I'm glad to say I caught Dio around four or five different times over the years but say that I missed the last Heaven and Hell tour. A true metal LEGEND of Monsterous proportions that will live on forever. The old Sabbath songs are my personal favorites but the whole show delivers. Get this blu ray immediately if you do not own it!!<br /><br />PS- I had to add an edit to this review to mention how incredibly cool the bonus features and interviews with RJD are in this set. Some of the best most intimate stuff you will ever see!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game hard to put it down .hard to keep up with it fast pace.<br />Good game try it you be hooked
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|the game moves to quick need to slow it down so you can complete course. also they need to help you with bonuses
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|UPDATE A YEAR LATER<br /><br />I originally purchased 2 Chromecasts the day the product was announced at Google I/O 2013. I didn't even know what it was I ordered other than it was a cheap way to stream content from Google Play. Since getting my two dongles I have added 3 more to my home networks (every TV has one now).<br /><br />Google has done what Apple failed to do. That is offer a \\"Smart TV\\"/cord cutting solution at an extremely affordable price. The updates this year (July 2014) include full screen mirroring from all Android devices(your Home Screen goes up on the TV), local casting (my photos & videos on the TV) and now there's a host of supported apps that let me put just about anything on my TV.<br /><br />You do still need to provide power to your dongle with the supplied USB cable. (I find plugging it into the power brick allows me to remotely turn on the TV as well as change the source from my phone alone.) But the price has actually dropped $5 over the last year.<br /><br />This is no longer a \\"What if\\" geek toy but a \\"must have\\" accessory for every home TV. Setup is dropdead simple. Under 5 minutes from any device (phone, tablet, computer). The longest task is entering your WiFi password.<br /><br />I gave these out to my siblings as stocking stuffers last Christmas. Now it is among the accessories I buy for every new TV. What is lacking is still some app support. NFL needs to add Chromecasting to their NFL Rewind. The news site apps need to have Chromecast.<br /><br />Due to the app development and continued low price I've upped my star rating from 4 to 5. Don't think; just buy.w the app support is growing. We have Hulu Plus and Plex in the works. There are apps in development for streaming off your local device. Netflix, Google Play and Youtube are working flawlessly. I only wish I had gotten more than 2 devices. As soon as Google gets more made I expect this to make a nice stocking stuffer this Christmas.
B00CDXOPYE|5.0|The wife talked me into watching this movie with here and I do have to admit, I liked it.  She cried like a baby at the end and she said it was great.
B00BMQDM10|1.0|her worst book ever. so expensive so disappointing so boring i want my money back. i could not bring myself to finish it. a total waste. i am so angry.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I really did not expect to love this so much but this story is so wonderful. The life of a free spirited boy who is looking for adventure. The story takes place along the Mississippi in the late 1800's. Mark Twain is such an incredible writer, I am so glad I decided to read this- everyone should!
B0014DQSG2|2.0|This movie just annoyed me...this could be because I'm an Anglophile.  Yes, I'm an American, but I prefer the English style. Apparently the American way is best, though, according to this movie, that saying: \\"I hope your sleeping arrangements are conducive to\\"...is improved by shortening it and saying \\"Sweet Dreams.\\"  Why of course sweet dreams is preferable--if you're a simpleton.  It's Disney if you ask me.  Yes, this is another princess movie.  Watching Colin Firth and the other Brits is the only saving grace.  Casting the English as the ugly (not ugly in this case, just mean) step sister worked in some way, but our American version of the Cinderella girl, while at least without malice and cattiness, was klutzy and clueless.  She's all about fashion, her appearance, music, magazines, flaunting that slim little figure around because this is what American teen girls are supposed to think about, right?  Is this our ideal?  Is that how we want to be thought of?  The dignified English have been poked fun at too many times.  It's getting old.  How about we poke fun at the American way?  God knows Americans have their issues.  Ask any person in England!  God help us.
B003V9OCIS|4.0|This German movie is exciting and dramatic. The characters are believable and the story is based on a true life event. The Nazi issues are not glossed over, and the human reactions to the events in the story seem honest and interesting.<br />In today's climbing world when equipment is top notch and manufactured to rigid safety specs, its refreshing and exciting to know that these climbers back in the 30's forged their own pitons, made their own carabiners and used regular hemp rope and knots to climb.
B000YABS8E|5.0|For those of us who grew up in the era of bomb shelters and the threat of nuclear war, this movie nicely lampoons that insanity, with brilliantly funny performances Christopher Walken and Sissy Spacek as the parents. Lots of laughs.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|The sales transaction was effiecient.  Product arrived in excellent condition (new.)  Just found a small flaw in the last of the DVDs, season 3.  Thought too late to go back to the seller for a replacement
B00BIR381W|4.0|Wasn't for me. it was for my daughter.  I hear no complaints from her.  Assuming everything is good and working fine.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A good page turner with lots of twist and surprises. The tension and interest was maintained through the book and the surprises kept coming, right to the end. A compelling and well written read. I can just see this being made into a movie.
B003VXMMTK|5.0|Masterpiece Theatre does it again! If you loved Hardy's novel, you will love watching it brought to life with an impeccable cast, costumes, and settings.
B00AJSY9ZK|5.0|I discovered Blind Guardian within the past few years and fell in love. Bought \\"A Twist in the Myth\\" and \\"At the Edge of Time\\" as soon as I was able to and listened to them quite a bit. I couldn't seem to get my hands on any of their other albums, though.<br /><br />Then, this came along. Every one of their albums except for the two I already owned, remastered, plus even more. I purchased it and it's proven to be a good choice.<br /><br />For fans who don't own all/most of Blind Guardian's studio albums, I highly recommend this set. However, for fans who do own most of Blind Guardian's studio albums already, I'd recommend that you look up sample songs from this set on YouTube and compare it to the versions you already own. Whether you deem this worthy of your money at that point is up to your preference.
0307742997|5.0|Five stars for the narrator, three plus for the writer [zero for the editor].  My first Nesbo, and I am planning to listen to as many as my library gets in.  The operative word is \\"listen.\\"  Had I been reading this, I most likely  would have chucked it when the first huge \\"hole\\" popped up, about a quarter of the way in.  A hole big enough into which to drive an oversized Volvo and no way around it...kept on echoing, intruding throughout the remainder of the book.  Thought to myself that even though I am not a romanticized alcoholic Swedish detective with amazing sharply honed detecting skills and experience to match, I would never have missed \\"that\\" one.  There are a number of other  annoying holes, but as Robin Sachs is such an accomplished, superior narrator [have a listen to \\"Our Kind of Traitor\\"], he was able to trump the plot problems. On the opposite bank of plot positives, there were a good number of unexpected digressions that worked well and overall it is an exciting, at many moments blood pressure rising, tale.  However, whenever I find myself recommending \\"The Snowman,\\" it is never to read the book, but to listen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!<br />I love this game because you can go on an adventure on survival,<br />or go beyond on creative with unlimited supplies.<br />I wish you could spawn monsters.<br />I hope thats in the next update.<br />I hope i run into HEROBRINE believe it or not.<br />I want to see him.<br />IVE NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE :(<br /><br />P.S. i hope you guys like this review!!!!!<br />P.S. make sure to get MINECRAFT, its AWESOME!!!!!<br /><br />-YOathleteBRO :)
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Very exciting storyline and terrific acting.  Would recommend  to anyone.  Excellent scenery as well.  Am waiting for the next episodes starting in January.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This classic story is timeless.  I enjoy reading it as an adult, and also like reading it to my kids.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great app. Time flies while playing! My kids loved helping with the hidden objects. Looking forward to the next one....
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie is well written and compelling.  The ending is fantastic.  Young children 7 years and under would probably be bored.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love the game. kids love the game. Family loves the game. addidctive game, should be outlawed. Angry birds are angry.
B00005N6KG|5.0|These have been my mainstay headphones for years.  Run with them until they short out and then buy another pair.  Great for the kids, who are incredibly hard on electronics and because these are louder than most so work well with notoriously quiet ipads/nexus tablets over the roar of the airplane.<br />Too bad they appear to be discontinued as there doesn't appear to be a suitable alternative.
B0001HAHXW|4.0|Just finished listening to the CD.  I am a lifelong Clapton fan.  I like his different personalities throughout the years.  But if you like Clapton because you like Tears in Heaven or Wonderful Tonight, or even Layla then beware.  You will not find any of Clapton's rock or pop on this album. This is Clapton playing  hardcore blues.  Right there with From The Cradle.  Loved this version of Love in Vain and Traveling Riverside Blues.  Those are the two songs that caught my attention on the first listen.  I was busy with roundtoit work so my full attention was not there.  Can't wait to listen with the headphones on.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I really enjoy this writing.  Everything is in awesome detail.  After hearing about this series, I saw the movie and decided I had to read the book too.  The movie was awesome, but the book is even better.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Looks like a fun app. To bad it never gets past the main page because it can't ever connect to it's server...
B001NLKT60|5.0|After reading the The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, I had to keep reading the series.  I love all the detail that goes into the story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|How can you not love the minions? This is just like temple rush in concept with fun  minion humor and gru inventions. Highly recommended.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Looking forward to the next installment in the series.  Definitely hooked.<br /><br />Anthony Ryan is an excellent story teller.  His prose is succinct, the plot is solid so far and the story drew me in.  I was a bit hesitant to buy the book at first but am glad I did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very addictive game. The grafics are great,  its fast paced and is a great way to fill some spare time.
B00DQQZNZW|4.0|Well, I must say I am surprised by the negative reviews here (of which there are few), because, unless I'm mistaken, \\"Electric\\" isn't unusual for the Pet Shop Boys. I mean, come on fans, don't you remember 1988's \\"Introspective\\"? Six long-playing club tracks? Not one negative review here seems to remember that the boys have been here before. To me, as a long time Pet Shop Boys fan, \\"Electric\\" reminds me entirely of \\"Introspective\\". Heck, they should have just called it \\"Introspective 2\\".<br /><br />That being said, \\"Electric\\" is one of the better Pet Shop Boys albums in recent memory. I went back and listened to \\"Bilingual\\", \\"Nightlife\\", \\"Release\\", \\"Fundamental\\", \\"Yes\\" and \\"Elysium\\" again, with all their respective b-sides as well. \\"Electric\\" is pretty good. I certainly liked it better than \\"Elysium\\". I like the club approach, the longer songs, the minimal lyrics--I think the boys did a great job on the beats and melodies. I have been listening to \\"Electric\\" for a week and a half now, and I think I've listened to the entire thing a dozen times now, and I have to say this album is pretty good. It never gets boring, and there are several songs here that should be hits from \\"Bolshy\\" to Bruce Springsteen's \\"The Last To Die\\". Of course, my favorite track is \\"Love Is A Bourgeois Construct\\" with it's classical arrangements courtesy of Henry Purcell.<br /><br />For those negative critics who complain about \\"Thursday\\" and it's rap by Example, well, I don't get it. When I heard \\"Thursday\\" I instantly thought classic Pet Shop Boys circa \\"West End Girls\\"--which, if you remember, Neil 'raps' almost the same way Example raps. \\"Thursday\\" is quintessential Pet Shop Boys. I also thoroughly enjoyed \\"Inside A Dream\\" (which contains lines from William Blake for all you naysayers about the lyrics). \\"Shouting In The Evening\\" is the perfect club track along with \\"Axis\\".<br /><br />So, I suppose the only song that I felt was a little weak was \\"Vocal\\". It just kind of sits there at the end of the album.<br /><br />It's true, with \\"Electric\\" the Pet Shop Boys return in fine form for the first time since, say, 2006's \\"Fundamental\\". Other Pet Shop Boys fans might like the soft sounds and adult contemporary bent of \\"Release\\", \\"Yes\\" and \\"Elysium\\", but I say no, the Pet Shop Boys have always been electronic, dance, New Wavers, and that's always been their greatest strength. Pet Shop Boys acoustic? Not for me. It's okay, but it's not their strength. \\"Electric\\" plays to most of their strengths, but I wouldn't give it five stars. I mean, \\"Actually\\" and \\"Very\\" are five stars, not \\"Electric\\".<br /><br />Here's how \\"Electric\\" compares with Pet Shop Boys other works:<br /><br />1986 Please: Four Stars<br />1987 Actually: Five Stars<br />1988 Introspective: Three Stars<br />1990 Behaviour: Four Stars<br />1993 Very: Five Stars<br />1996 Bilingual: Four Stars<br />1999 Nightlife: Three and a Half Stars<br />2002 Release: Three and a Half Stars<br />2006 Fundamental: Four Stars<br />2009 Yes: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Elysium: Three Stars<br />2013 Electric: Four Stars<br /><br />1986 Disco: Three Stars<br />1994 Disco 2: One Star<br />2003 Disco 3: Four Stars<br />2007 Disco 4: One Star<br /><br />1995 Alternative: Five Stars<br />2012 Format: Four Stars<br /><br />1991 Discography: Four Stars<br />2003 PopArt: Five Starsof the album.<br /><br />It's true, with \\"Electric\\" the Pet Shop Boys return in fine form for the first time since, say, 2006's \\"Fundamental\\".

B006GWO5NE|4.0|I only wish they made them longer. Kindles don't come with a remote, so could be a little annoying if you need to rewind.
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|Read the reviews about how fun kukuro is, and that this app was good but glitchy, but it being the FAOTD decided to give it a try. Not knowing the rules, I first read them and almost couldn't get out of them. In the Kindle Fire (2nd gen) at least, the bar at the bottom showing home and faves stayed up, partly covering the button to continue. Maybe if I could have seen to the bottom I would have realized that &quot;play all games&quot; would continue to the next screen, but as it was, I thought it was just an encouragement to play the game. Finally figured it out, after trying everything else including closing and opening it a couple of times (which does nothing -- the game opens where you left off).<br /><br />So I finally tapped to &quot;play all games&quot;, selected the smallest game -- I'm good at logic games, but like to go easy at first to make sure I understand the rules and game play and such -- and eagerly waited for this fun and exciting game to appear... and was greeted with a black screen and only a black screen. Waiting did nothing; tapping the back arrow did nothing, restarting the game did nothing. Deleted the game, thankful I spent no money on it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is what I wanted in a weather. Have no problem understand how to use it. Everyone would get to like this app
B007SYWFRM|2.0|It is just like all the other games out there now, you don't get enough of money, food, gold or diamonds to keep you going, if you want to you have to spend REAL money!  I just can't keep playing games like this.  When they make it better I will reinstall and play it again.  Until then it will just take up space in my apps.  Sorry but truth is truth.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|A page turner but that's about it.  If this book were a movie, you'd watch it while doing something else.
1423140605|4.0|This was a gift so I've not personally read it myself, but the party who received it, has enjoyed it.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|It was a decent remake. I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the original just as much. So I would recommend it.
B00DYTKKGI|4.0|I was looking forward to getting the app but it wasn't what I was expecting. The only thing I didn't like was that you couldn't use the pro kit  because you have to pay 99 cents. Besides that it's awesome.
B000FJGWBC|4.0|Paul Walker.... enough said. i will watch him in any movie any time!!!  he is beautiful and so is miss alba
0452273331|5.0|This enduring classic was written in 1943 - now 70 years later Ayn Rand's philosophy against collectivism is as true today.  Ayn Rand was a great literary novelist and philosopher, who shared her point of view through fiction.<br />This book is about an architect who dared to be passionate about his work and his integrity.  It showcases how many people are willing to live a life of being second-handers.  They are unable of thinking their own thoughts and simply follow along with the masses.<br /><br />Ayn Rand's philosophy on objectivism is explored, nor through boring doctrine, but rather unfolds through in a page-turning story of love, passion, truth, relationships and power.  While it has all the ingredients of a good drama, it also encourages you to think and question some of your own values.<br /><br />This book followed \\"We The Living\\" written in 1936 (which I'm now going to read) and also Atlas Shrugged (1957) which is my all-time favourite book on entrepreneurship and capitalism.<br /><br />The Fountainhead is the perfect blend of an engaging and entertaining story, while also educating and making you think.<br />P.S.  Since this book is 70 years old, it also offers good insight in to the culture of that time.  The world was very man-centered, which comes through loud and clear where it was expected that a woman simply support her man and also quit her job once she got married.  Fortunately, this has changed.  Also, Ayn writes that of one of the female characters that she \\"was a petite lady only a size 12\\".  Unfortunately this has changed and the media has created a belief that size 12 is now extra-large.<br /><br />Diana Young- World Traveler - currently sailing in the South Pacific for six month and #1 Amazon Best-selling author of Financial Fitness for Beginners.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|After watching the Netflix series Orange is the New Black, I wanted to know more and the book is so much better than the series.  Glad I read the book.  Piper did an amazing job of sharing her life and what goes on in prison and how Piper survived this experience.  Most of all first hand experience from Piper about the failure of the prison system.  I would only hope that her book caused some questions to be asked or investigations into treatment and conditions.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Absolutely love this game. Any age can play and not get bored. Only downside is having to purchase extra levels, but that is the nature of the business.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|GREAT MOVIE FUN TO WATCH, KEEPS YOU ON THE EDGE OF YOUR SEAT. CAST IS ALSO EXCELLANT. I THINK IT IS ONE OF TOM CRUSES BEST SENSE TOP GUN. I HAVE WATCHED IT ATLEAST  7 TIMES. GREAT, GREAT.

B000093FLA|5.0|Wether it is Comedy/Action/Suspensce you are looking for . This movie has it all!!! A must see. Great actors (<br /> and  Superb acting )!! This excentric plot screams to be watched over and over. I have even Nick named one of my close freinds after a careckters in this film. Take a step back this weekend and have some laughs with your loved one over some redenbocker and this must see film of centuries!!

B008Y7IP0S|3.0|Inspiring movie when it came out years ago, but not academy award material. I enjoyed watching it again, but have seen many better versions since.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This app is really fun its kinds of like temple run in a way the Fugger u get the harder it is.
B001L5YW9I|5.0|All fo the actors were incredible in their roles. The music is incredible. It inspired me to seek out much more celtic-types of music when I first saw it not long after it came out. It is the type of movie you watch numerous times in your lifetime and it doesn't get old. DDL and MS are amazing actors.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|One of my favorite books and still a treat to watch.  So often the shorter version is the one shown on tv so it was nice to be able to see the scenes that had been cut, like the water reclamation ceremony.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I wanted an app that would stay on all night while traveling so I could wake up at any point and see what time it is. This app has a setting to allow you to do that.  It will keep your Kindle \\"on\\" all night.  Just remember to also keep it plugged in all night too.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This prequel to the Lord of the Rings trilogy filled in a lot of details that made it easy to better understand the earlier movies.  I especially enjoyed the additional disc with the blog format that Jackson used to share 'behind-the-scenes' information.
B000E1YW0E|5.0|I was happy with the product. I purchased it for my Great Nephew. It was a great price and extremely fast delivery. Love it!
B00APYKXFS|4.0|this game is kinda like a faster space invaders or asteroid but with the touch screen control it makes the game fun because you can move your ship around faster and with more control than ever before, plus your ship is continuously firing bullets to destroy the enemy without even having to touch a button, giving you more brain space to process the maneuvering and taking out enemies. Its a fun game with an older theme that has been used a lot previously, so I gave it 4 stars.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the book; one of the best I've read in a while. Characters well developed and so intersting. Heart wrenching at times.
B000VWPX3G|5.0|My favorite song on the GZA album &#34;I Gotcha Back!&#34; I would love a similar beat like that one from RZA.
1616551607|4.0|I was thinking this would contain the same extras as the previous special boxed edition, it doesn't. It only contains the 3 volumes but it's still great. Like other reviews mentioned the slip case presentation is beautifully realized in a fine cloth print covering, quite delicate so handle with care. Solidly bound books, thick paper and muted gloss finish suggest durability overall.<br /><br />The prints represent Amano's fluid style many of which are what would seem light sketches while others more fully realized works of art. I find it inspiring because you get to see his basic approach to creating character designs, then how he refines compositions by balancing color with form.<br /><br />For this price it's a must have for Amano fans. Amazon took great care in packaging to insure that this hefty set arrives unscathed.<br /><br />I only took one star off, but it was mainly because I was under the wrong impression that it included the bonus mini biography of the artist which reveals a glimpse into his choice of art tools and processes.
B00136JS8U|5.0|You already know Wu-tang Clan forever R.I.P Ol Dirty Bastard! Favorite song &#34;Heaven or Hell!&#34; Raekwon always recorded material I could relate too, growing up in Miami,FL. The area is very rough & Violent.

0307341550|5.0|Wow! I am now a huge fan after this one. Gillian's characters are super wicked. I loved Camille even though she was double dipped in crazy. This book kept me guessing until the end. I recommend!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Fantastic writing, wonderful actors, gorgeous costumes and lighting....I can't rave about it enough.  You love these characters, even with their flaws.  This was another amazing season, and quite an emotional roller coaster.  I am eagerly awaiting the next season!
030758836X|5.0|This book started off a bit slow, but do not quit because this is a piece of work. Gillian Flynn does not just write a book. She creates life into her characters more than others. You can tell that she takes her writing seriously with her facts and story lines. I absolutely loved her.
0545128285|4.0|I've never even read any of the Harry Potter novels, but I just picked this up on impulse, and was pleasantly surprised. A nice mist of short modern-day fairy tales, each with a strong moral message at the end. So, if you're a Harry Potter fan, I'd imagine that you'll REALLY love this, but even if you're not one, like me, you should still enjoy it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun and seem  life like. Highly recommended :)<br />You can name the horse yourself and buy as many as you want.P
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Pretty funny movie, especially if you are or have ever been pregnant...some parts are a little tear jerking but overall really enjoyed the movie!

B005DD7H50|5.0|Trippy.  Wouldn't it be cool if there was a way to experience limitless confidence?  Perfect clarity of thought?  Unbridled cognition?
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|The description of \\"This is 40\\", indicates this is a sequel to knocked up, which was an awesome movie.  However, something went horrible wrong during the filming of this disaster.  It's unnecessarily vulgar from the first 2 minutes all the way up to the end, which is an excruciating 2 hours later.  Much of the cast is 1st rate, who I have enjoyed in many other movies; but the script here is so bad that even this exceptional cast cannot salvage this mess of a movie.  Apparently there are those who actually enjoyed this movie, which is a mystery to me.  This is one of the worse movies I can remember viewing and I hope that this review will serve as a warning to you.
B002N14GPE|5.0|Intelligent movie. Loved every second of it! Kept me on my toes. Definitely a must see movie! Will but for my collection.
B00873GRU4|4.0|If you love a good post-apocalypse Science Fiction story (Who doesn't ?) then spend some time in the World of the Silos. Wool is well written action packed and held my attention to the end. I will read the next in the series
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I thought it was great. Good for kids and adults alike. I am 67 and just went to the movies to see the second on. Just as good if not better!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is not only a great book about politics and war, it's also a wonderful study of human nature.  I couldn't put it down.

B003DWC6IQ|5.0|And there are so many. Another J. Archer page turner. I always wonder if Mr. Archer thinks of the end first and then writes the book based on the end. Can't wait for his next novel.
B0074VTHKM|2.0|This book was very simplistic and just not the enthralling read I expected from Grisham. I was very disappointed.  Sorry.

B005K17RU0|5.0|Very accurate love the updated maps to watch where the bad weather is. Love having the weather at my finger tips

B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much.I love each and everyone update. I got on my kindle fire and works perfectly.
B000W11JGG|5.0|One of the best rock& roll albums of all time. Words and music came together on this masterpiece. Simply timeless and incredible songs.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Really enjoyed most of it, it was fascinating at times, boring at some other parts ...but most of all it was one hell of a ride down earth's worst war ever. You have to get used to the structure of it - divided to interviews with survivors around the globe but once you do, the overall story becomes so interesting and unique. Gotta hand it to brooks for his vast knowledge and skills of combining the stories and hard facts all together. Read it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|You will want to watch it more than once.<br /><br />Great suspense.  Wonderful action.  Incredible special effects.  Not predictable.<br /><br />I can't believe I had not watched this already.  And, I can't wait to see Red 2!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it, couldn't put it down, ready for more rooms.  This game was really fun for the whole family. Definitely worth the five stars!
B008K3HRF0|5.0|This a wonderful family and kid friendly movie.  Or, if you are like me and just love kid's movies, you will love it.  I have watched it a half dozen times already.<br /><br />Danny DeVito is great as the Lorax.<br /><br />I read other reviews that were not the best, and almost didn't get it.  I am very glad I did.  It is a cute, fun, well done, heart warming movie.

B00AR1G3FS|5.0|Absolutely love this show. The Eagles sound great. Love the solo stuff they do as well. Well, except for &#34;You Belong to the City&#34;..LOL<br />Highlights are &#34;Heartache Tonight&#34;, &#34;Hotel California&#34;, &#34;Life in The Fast Lane&#34;, &#34;One of These Nights&#34;, &#34;Rocky Mountain Way&#34;..<br />Let me tell ya though, &#34;Dirty Laundry&#34; is the absolute most bad ass song of the set. Man it sounds so good!!!! Do wish that &#34;Witchy Woman&#34; and &#34;Best of My Love&#34; were in the line up, but it is almost three hours of great tunes.<br />The audio is excellent, the video is clear and sharp, and the music is timeless.<br />You have to have this in your collection.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my uncle hates the game but everyone that's not a stick in the mud will love it a gr8 buy I have Pc edition even better!!!!
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|I love it. It's like almost as awesome vice city.. I personally give it a four out of five<br />.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you want to read it again. In some of the bad reviews people said that Hazel and Augustus spoke to maturely to have been teenagers and didn't act like teenagers. I would expect a young cancer patient to be more mature than your average teenagers, your maturity level is made up of things that you experience and the way you react to those things. The characters in this novel are flawless and I would not change  a thing about it, if the novel were about a teenage girl with cancer that drowns in self pity no-one want to read it. I couldn't wait to sit in the quiet and just read this novel for a couple of hours at the end of my day.<br /><br />Yours Truly,<br />A Young Adult With A Chronic Disease
0061122416|5.0|I loved this book - insightful!! The book came in earlier than expected, and I was just surprised with the condition. The book was like New, I expected to be in less than better condition! I was pleased, with it! =)
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Walking dead has done for zombies what Spielberg did for sharks.  This show has started a craze, world war z may get credit as a good book (no so great movie) but the walking dead tv series put it on film and made it much better!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent cast, excellent screenplay and character development.  But, when a cast member wants to leave, don't kill off the character; replace the actor.
0062082353|5.0|Chris was a true American hero cut down before his time.  I am very sorry to the family for the brother Marine who shot him, and our prayers are with his family.  Great book about a great hero in a difficult time in difficult places.  Highly recommended, could not put to down.

B00DU74U74|5.0|Finely a Pod People movie with a great ending.  Loved the idea and the way the story unfolded. I love the Host:D
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Fantastic book once you get past all the stairs. The story sucks you in and doesn't let go. It Jan  depressing tale with a great ending

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Not too hard but fun and challenging.  Eagerly. Awaiting. New rooms. Worth a shot for this one and its free.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Could not be happier running Evernote on Kindle, droid phone, laptop &amp; desktop. Web clipper lets me clip pages for viewing on any device later. Evermore Food (iOS, droid only) is great linked in, but won't run on Kindle Fire.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This is the best of all of the apps that I have tried. I can read the maps and get other types of weather conditions in more than one location.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I found this by accident. An interesting take on what would happen if aliens found us and wanted to exploit our resources. The aliens themselves are very different from the typical biped aliens you see in movies. The only silly recurring thing is two-legged machines kinda like the Star Wars walking machines. Hard to believe a race capable of space travel would bother with things that walked.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I tried to create iPad videos indoors in a quiet area just using the iPad microphone but the sound was too quiet on the resulting video. I asked friends about it and they recommended this lavalier mic. This does the trick, now I get professional sound quality for my videos. I also needed to get an &#34;iPhone 1/8 inch microphone adapter - 3.5mm 4 conductor TRRS Male to 3.5mm Microphone Input Jack&#34; to connect it to. It has a nice long cord and is easy to use. The battery is easy to put in but I haven't quite figured out how to remove it when I need to replace it. I figure I will take it to the battery store and have them do it.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|I take a lot of walks at night, and this app is not only beautiful but useful in planning out the moonlit walks.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this is a cool game and i like it because it is a really: nice, cool, and, awesome game  BUY IT!
B008JFUO0Y|1.0|I should say that the original movie is one of my all time favorite movies; it's original, groundbreaking, funny, and entetaining on just about every level,<br />it's the kind of movie that each time I see it, and I've seen it many times, it leaves me grinning because of it's uniqeness and cleverness.  And knowing it was made on a shoe string budget by a bunch of amateurs is just icing on the cake.  So while I didn't expect the remake to be as good as the orginal, I still had high hopes.  Needless to say those hopes were dashed against the rocks into a bloody pulp.  The remake is lifeless, humorless, predictable, and not in the least bit fun.  I wasn't grinnimg while watching the movie, I was shaking my head in dismay.  Oh it's gory alright, and the blueray picture quality is very nice, but that my friends is all it has going for it. At no time does it draw you in, or connect you to any of the characters, and you certainly don't find yourself cheering for any of them like Bruce Campbell in the original. The story simply plods alomg from one gory scene to the next, leaving one hoping that it will end mercifully sooner, rather than later. So I say stick with original or it's great gory cousin Dead Alive, if you want to come away grinning, entertained, and a proud fan of the genre.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome! It's hard to believe it's free. It's so realistic  and entertaining. I'm always on it for hours. Definitely recommend it.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|she has a great voice and puts a real Arabian spin on some of the classics to transport you back to ancient Jerusalem.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|We liked the challenging puzzles in this game, and hope that they will add more levels in the future.  Very engaging!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|DVDs are complete; no deleted scenes. I am a die-hard TWD fanatic and I noticed no deleted or altered scenes.
B00908DDZM|4.0|Great old NON gangsta rap. Creative and smart, back beats are well placed on the (edits).  For the that like the style of the British group Stereo MC's, should love Macklemore for the combo of creative lyrics and dancing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome, just needs some more subways n tunnels to go through. After so long going through different countries it gets kind of boring going through the same tunnels and hopping over the same trains. But the game itself is addictive...<br />Thanks for creating this one....
B004AGI2L4|5.0|It was a surprise? This movies touches upon the breakdown of Rome's Northern army. Very well edited and the storyline and crisp and clean. Well acted and the script is very believable.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game!! I would recommend this game to people who like sharks, obviously, and to people who like to see sharks eat other sharks, people, and animals.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Great beginning to the Maze Runner series. Love apocalypse books! Not any of the same characters. I feel like this book is realistic.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I really was never interested in this movie because it seemed to fall so close to the Twilight lovers which isn't my thing... but wow I was really surprised! Great plot and well acted. Very pleasantly surprised!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I read the directions on how to play,but an example would have helped me understand what to expect as far as the puzzles and clues. It's really fun, and my little one loves finding clues.
B007SGM084|2.0|Boring reading.  Same stuff over and over again.  Soft porn if you are into that, but there is no real plot to keep me interested
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really like the graphics and different puzzles to solve, but just as it gets good you have to pay for the &quot;full game&quot;.
B0000024IE|5.0|Wow....good timing when I purchased this product.  Grew up on this music and was glad it was available.  Great buy!
B001HN6922|5.0|We bought this as toddler loves the first DVD and to make another order eligible for free shipping. We were pleasantly surprised with the bonus mater-toon and toy story one. Also there is a Mexican Spanish audio option :)
B005LAIISA|4.0|We love all the Ice Age films. Funny and weird characters appeal to the grand kids and us older folk too.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|They are a perfect compliment to each other's characters.  Love the story line. Am enjoying this show immensely.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in the way lawyers work.  Serious but light.
B000001FK3|5.0|I first heard this in 1972, sharing a house with two wannabe guitarists who exposed to Roy Buchanan and then JJ Cale.  Naturally is a gem of well constructed but laid back, cruisey blues which is intensely satisfying to listen to. JJ Cale is a gifted guitarist/songwriter. His live performance a few years after this seemed to show an extraordinary personality at work. I think there was talk the tour would not go ahead because he had a form of arthritis which might affect his ability with the guitar.  The gig at the Auckland Town Hall went ahead. In days when \\"stars\\" let the band get cooking before they would walk on with false modesty to rapturous applause, JJ Cale was on stage before proceedings kicked off, tuning up and razzing with other musicians before starting into a mesmerising set covering this album and \\"Troubador\\". If his playing was affected it was perhaps in a spare use of notes but he was still impressive and value for money. But it is this album, Naturally I still play today and it makes for rich listening. There is not one track which is wasted and it fits together well as a progression of sound and texture. JJ Cale has a slightly raspy, smoky voice with bitter sweet and often quirky lyrics (\\"Clyde the dog plays electric bass...ok I exaggerate, it was tambourine tied to his tail and lead vocals...\\") probably on JJ's porch, with his band improvising, why would the hound not partake in such a warm treacle of sweet sound. My favourite tracks are the haunting love peons \\"Call the Doctor\\", \\"River Runs Deep\\". However, the album has recognisable classics, his two most well known songs \\"After Midnight\\" and \\"Crazy Mama\\". So lets chugga lug and shout for whether he was well enough known is debatable but JJ Cale was a master craftsman and I thank him for the pleasure he has given me and I will continue to treasure this album as a reflection of a life well lived. I strongly recommend it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and cute must buy its free anyways love it...best movie game ever I hope you all get it while it's free
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I love this game! I have it on my smart phone and now on my Kindle Fire. This game helps the time pass at the doctor's office, airport and waiting at the courthouse hoping you get out of jury duty! The puzzles actually challenge you to drop the balls in as few shots as possible, so you feel as though your brain is actually being challenged! There are hundreds of puzzles and they are unlocked by finishing the previous puzzle. When I am done with all the games I find it a fun challenge to go back and try to best my score and get all 3 stars. I would say this game is well worth it, whether you get it for free or paid $2 or $3 for it!
B005JABSB6|5.0|I have really enjoyed the 3D glasses. My parents and I watched Greatest Aquariums of America in 3D and the fish look like they are swimming right there in the family room. We also watched Jurassic Park in 3D and the whole movie took on a suprising realism not obtainable with 2D. I almost want to call it virtual reality. The AN3DG20B's have a large lense and are made to be  worn over reading glasses if necessary.
B00BKBCM4A|5.0|The Wildest Moments song sealed my love for her voice.  No To Love, Running, Devotion  are great songs. There is only two songs I have removed from my playlist off this album.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I love this show. When it first began, I did not like it, but now a few years later, I find it compelling and relevant.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I wanted a fun, engaging movie that was exciting, thrilling, and funny. It was all that, plus it contained some brutal violence that was appropriately upsetting. Excellent fresh handling of the detective/action/adventure genres that is up to par with McQuarrie's other excellent directorial and screenwriting work. Deft handling of the usual tropes and twists by a master of his craft. Tom Cruise delivers the acting goods, yet again, despite my always wanting to dislike him. :) Excellent acting, quick witted dialogue, fun, fun, fun. Highly recommended. McQuarrie's &#34;The Way of the Gun&#34; is similar in tone but perhaps darker and definitely funnier (both &#34;Jack Reacher&#34; and &#34;The Way of the Gun&#34; are dark movies with dark humor) and is also highly recommended.
B008BQ8YHQ|3.0|like the characters. mainly Donna and Harvey.. but  this season lacks the tension and the surprise of past . However there is still time to capture the previous DAZZLE.. that had me tuning in week by week..
B0052RDHTM|5.0|interesting and fascinating book describing life in Wales, Russia, and England before, during and after the First World War. Most enjoyable
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everyone knows why Downton Abbey is so beloved...the acting, the writing, the directing, the costumes! What's not to love.<br />Can't imagine how they will survive the death of Matthew though. That really may be the undoing.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|The cable that came with my Kindle only lasted two months. I think that is a very short life span. My new one I just received is working fine but I will see how it goes. After a month or two I will come back and update.
B00AQM8H9I|1.0|Tried this gsme and just could not get into it. Finally deleted it. I am glad it was free when I got it.
B005J3IEZQ|4.0|Great insights, good writing, keeping you involved and wanting more. This is exactly why you, we, all love apple...it's DNA
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Got to modify a recipe or add some measurements together?  Fraction Calculator Plus  makes it easy and almost enjoyable. Until we (USA)  switch to metric this is a must have app.
0385349947|4.0|I would have to say that this book ended up surpassing my expectations. When a book becomes wildly popular or raved about in the media it is easy to get over excited or end up with higher than realistic expectations as to how good it will end up being.<br /><br />I think that this book contains a message that many women need to hear. By nature I would consider myself to be a person who has never really followed the crowd and someone who gets fired up the more people doubt me or tell me that I can't do something, so I felt like was perhaps in less of a need to hear the messages that Sheryl conveyed throughout this book. With that being said I still learned a great deal and her research to backup her views was very informative and beneficial.<br /><br />If I had a critique of this book it would be that I think Sheryl unintentionally ended up writing a book for working mothers or mothers-to-be rather than a book for \\"Women\\" in the most generic sense of the word. She spends the vast majority of the book focused on how mom's can balance work and duties at home or how women should plan their career if they think they will one day want to start a family. She only really mentions single women once in her book with an example of a woman she met who felt that single people were not given respect for needing work life balance in the absence of not having families. She said that this individual felt that going to a party would be just as important as going to a child's soccer game if she ever wanted to meet someone so she could have her own child's soccer game to go to. I don't think it was Sheryl's intention to write a book that would ultimately end up pressuring the reader to get married and have a family but I feel that is what it became.<br /><br />Of course I want to someday have a family, that is my hope but I guess I thought that this book would take a more neutral stance in the event that I did not end up having children or getting married. Perhaps we are a ways away from breaking that gender stereotype.om breaking that gender stereotype.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This show and can't understand why it was only 1 season. I found out about it off if Big Bang as the characters reference it.  They're upset it was cancelled too.
B004R0WKNE|5.0|Funny and upbeat---makes you feel good---likeable characters for a lazy afternoon love story. There's a personality here that everyone will enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Good ap.  Challenging rooms that make you think.  I would recommend this game to a friend.  Provides many hours of fun.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|With Christian Slater, Patricia Arquette, Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, Gary Oldman, Brad Pitt and last, but not least, the late James Gandolfini, written by Quentin Tarantino and directed by the late Tony Scott, this is one of the best cult films I have seen.  I hadn't seen it before and the only reason I did, was because I was looking for movies with James Gandolfini, whom I love.  Wouldn't mind seeing it 10 or 20 times more. The scene between Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper is amazing.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|This group of cozy mysteries is charming. Lexy, the main character owns a bakery and solves murders on the side! These are not very long books...can be read in one sitting...but sweet and every character is easy to like.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I really enjoy this app. In a lot of ways it is easier to play than my other dragon game. I'm giving it a 4 only because it is harder to make neighbors and they don't give you as many missions. I wish I could remember the name of my other app.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|Best movie ever,  the actors being it to life. No matter how many times I see it live which is wonderful these Actors amaze me.
0811879542|5.0|This is a fantastic book!  I work in a children's store, and &#34;Press Here&#34; is my favorite book to recommend to grandparents.  Children are fascinated, watching their actions change the dots on the pages.  It is great for listening and following directions.
0062014536|5.0|Requiem by Lauren Oliver<br />Book 3 in a trilogy<br />5/5 stars<br />Some spoilers for Delirium and Pandemonium!<br /><br />Can I just cry right now????  This book was epic.  (It was my Best of the Bunch choice for March!)  I know it received a lot of questionable reviews...I saw some where the reviewer said, \\"5 stars for the first 3/4th, 1 star for the last 1/4th.\\"  I had NEVER seen that in all my 3 years of book blogging, so I was really nervous to start this.<br /><br />Fortunately for me, I'm one of the people in this world who believes it deserves 5 stars from beginning to end.  I don't really know how to describe what it did for me - my heart was broken and whole all at once.  Everything made sense.  If it had happened any differently, I don't know...maybe I would have liked it, but it wouldn't have had that shocking, real-life kind of feeling it gave me.<br /><br />By real life, I mean this:  Things happen.  Our stories are played out in our lives.  Once one battle is won (or lost) your life doesn't just stop.  It keeps going.  It's not the end.  Some things are left unsaid.  Some things aren't finished.  Some questions you won't have the answers to.  Sure, that sucks sometimes, but it's life.<br />Requiem earned my absolute respect and all my love because of this:  It doesn't \\"end\\".  I feel like there is more that will happen, so much more.  I also think that...it had to stop sometime.  There was sooo much work to be done after the climax that it could have gone on and on and on.<br /><br />Basically, I loved where she left it.  It had me gasping.  For those of you who have read it, highlight this:  OMG I'M SO HAPPY WHO SHE ENDED UP WITH YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!  That was ALL I ever REALLY wanted for this series!! ;)  (End spoiler.)  And on top of that ^^ the character development left me breathless, and the gorgeous prose was like a lullaby.  And Hana...a;sldfkja;slgj;askldjf!!!!  I just.  I mean.  UGH.<br />It was, to say the least, beautiful.<br /><br />Anyways.  If you loved the first two, PLEASE give this one a try.  Sure, it's a daunting one to pick up, but trust me, it's WORTH IT.  And I feel if you're prepared for the ending, it won't be as much of a bummer as it was to some people.<br /><br />This book reminds me of...<br />Forests<br />Rivers<br />Danger<br />Sacrificial love (my favorite kind)<br />Growth in character<br />Searching for beauty, especially in the unexpected<br />LOVE (because that's really what it's all about)<br /><br />Summary<br />(Spoilers for the first 2 books!)<br />They have tried to squeeze us out, to stamp us into the past.<br />But we are still here.<br />And there are more of us every day.<br />Now an active member of the resistance, Lena has been transformed. The nascent rebellion that was under way in Pandemonium has ignited into an all-out revolution in Requiem, and Lena is at the center of the fight.<br />After rescuing Julian from a death sentence, Lena and her friends fled to the Wilds. But the Wilds are no longer a safe haven--pockets of rebellion have opened throughout the country, and the government cannot deny the existence of Invalids. Regulators now infiltrate the borderlands to stamp out the rebels, and as Lena navigates the increasingly dangerous terrain, her best friend, Hana, lives a safe, loveless life in Portland as the fianc&eacute;e of the young mayor.<br />Maybe we are driven crazy by our feelings.<br />Maybe love is a disease, and we would be better off without it.<br />But we have chosen a different road.<br />And in the end, that is the point of escaping the cure: We are free to choose.<br />We are even free to choose the wrong thing.<br />Requiem is told from both Lena's and Hana's points of view. The two girls live side by side in a world that divides them until, at last, their stories converge./><br />Anyways.  If you loved the first two, PLEASE give this one a try.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|worked really well on my kindle fire. helped me free up alot of space around 3 Gb.  glad i installed it.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|We always seem to end up in hotel rooms with either a broken alarm clock, one that is impossible to figure out or none. I figured this app would solve all those problems.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|The game was fun and has a good storyline. I would recommend the game if you like puzzles and solving mystery s.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The most fun you can have and still be legal!<br />It's ABSOLUTELY ADDICTING in the best sense of the word, and like seeing the seven wonders of the world in a single site! Get lost for an hour, or a day; it's up to YOU!;+)<br />ENJOY!!
1781162646|5.0|Excellent departure from pure horror stories by master Stephen KIng.  The story was so riveting, it only took two days to finish.  Characters are finely crafted and mystery takes a while to figure out.
1439170045|5.0|Even though this is a novel, it is written by a professional who knows what she is talking about regarding this very cruel<br />disease.  My sister recommended it to me during the time our Mother was suffering and dying of the disease in 2011 and<br />it really gave me a different perspective.  The book is written through the eyes of the patient and what she is thinking and<br />feeling.  It is a real eye opener...another side of the coin, so to speak.  You'll be glad you read it.  It kind of gave me a bit<br />of peace.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Dragon vale is not the worst thing ever it's the most popular awesome dragon game out there I would get this if I were you you will have not a single regret ever best game ever I'm eight years old trust me though this is entertaining for all ages my brother's twelve years old and he enjoys it. Great for kindle fire...  GET IT NOW!!!!  Free game even if it wasn't free you would not regret it!  TRUE STORY!!!!  :p<br />Makes me :) AKA makes me happy
B00BV1OT0O|4.0|These little guys are very cute. There is some sloppy paint apps on here but they still look nicely on your shelf.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good and alaberant it is a must have game I can't stop playing the game great game that is my opinion anyway
B00992CF6W|2.0|I have high speed internet and no connection problems but for some reason it just says error and that it wont download. Not even an error code or any explanation why. Just tells me to try later. I have sufficient memory as well. What's my problem here?
B00CA4S3LW|5.0|Dancer & the Moon doesn't seem as inspired as their previous work but that still isn't saying I wouldn't recommend this cd!
B004Z2TUGE|1.0|One lame cheesy movie with terrible acting.  The action was ok, not great.  The guy falls in love in his situation, really? The bad guy learns the error of his ways? Give me a break ...
B004EWFV9K|4.0|I like kurt wallander as a charactr. This is, however, a very wistful, melancholic end to this book that I won't reveal.
1609611543|5.0|This book has very thought-provoking information in it!  I am just finishing my first week, gluten-free, and it wasn't nearly as painful as I thought it would be!!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|What a wonderfully refreshing movie that manages to take a topic that could easily spiral into a morose tale and makes it fun and hopeful.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|How you can go wrong with Morgan Freeman, Bruce Willis, and Helen Mirren? Karl Urban is pretty great as a straight man, too.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|Sequels are a tricky thing. They have to somehow extend the premise of the original movie to new areas while still hitting all the notes that the audience liked from that first one. Two goals that head in different directions. Despicable Me 2 largely manages the task though.<br /><br />It is a little less focussed than the first move as it tries to give all the characters something to do while simultaneously introducing the new plot. But once it gets all the plates spinning it keeps things going nicely and pulls everything together for the end.<br /><br />It's also a movie that's very aware of its dual audience. So we have fart jokes and people giggling about the word bottom, but we also get pop culture references and nods to old Bond movies amongst other things.<br /><br />The voice cast remains strong with Steve Carrell and Kristen Wiig doing a great job anchoring the movie. Wiig's character Lucy is in many ways the key element here as the plot takes the next obvious step of trying to add a mother figure to the family that Gru acquired in the first film. Again we're not really lighting the world on fire with originality but it's all done with polish and flair.<br /><br />And then of course there are the minions. In many ways the star of the Despicable Me franchise, and clearly the producers know it. The minions get more time to be cartoony and silly this time round. A lot of it doesn't exactly add to the plot, but it had my 8 year olds laughing hysterically. So mission accomplished right?<br /><br />All round a great family film. Not all the jokes hit, but it throws out so many there's always something new to make you smile and if it uses some very familiar plot elements, well at least it does it with style.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|When the game puts out a new version, say 1.8.5, and you have 1.8.0, You'll have to uninstall and reinstall the game.  This is annoying!!! It will save everything on your farm...but it's so aggrivating to have to update ll the time.  I don't have to do that with other games.  DianDian the manufacturer of the game should hire new I.T. people to fix that problem!
B00447L4KA|5.0|So, so funny and endearing.  Lots of good lines and scenarios that get stuck in your head that come out in normal conversation.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Liked it better than the last one, but is probably because I like Denarys and Tyrion.<br /><br />Not much court intrigue, which is a plus for me.
B000002L5P|5.0|It's interesting to see someone writing about teen years from a Catholic point of view.  Not as consistent as some of The Smiths other albums, but still worth of 5 stars.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|Always wanted to read this classic and really glad I did. At the end of each chapter I always wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next. The cliffhangers really got to me. The end was a bit rushed but the treasure hunt was the plot.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|If you like movies about psychological issues, this film is for you.  The scenery is amazing.  It is nothing like Stanley Kubrick's other films as far as I could see, but still great.  Ryan O'Neal really pulls it off.  Starts slow, but by the end, it is a very satisfying movie-watching experience.<br /><br />We saw the Kubrick exhibit at LACMA and read about the excruciating pains that were taken to make this film an accurate portrayal.  Costumes were purchased at auctions, along with painting to imitate for set design and costume accuracy.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I like the app to see may yahoo on my kindle a lot. It is easy to see and similar than using the pc.
6305428425|5.0|This is a total feel-good movie.  Memorable characters and funny scenes that have you laughing out loud.  Well-cast and well-acted.  Cleverly written script.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This album continues to grow on me. At first listen I wasn't so sure -- it's not as club/dance centric as previous Daft Punk albums -- but after a couple listens I was hooked. I especially like the transition facilitated by the piano between the first half and second half of the album, and I usually skip tracks with a lot of spoken word so was really surprised I like the track with Giorgio speaking.This is currently my go-to album. Listen to it start to finish a few times (rather than just picking the singles) and enjoy.
B007JWKLP6|5.0|This is a beautifully made story about the life of George Harrison.  A must have for any Beatles fan!  Thanks
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I have to agree with Joel D.  It's a DIE HARD movie.  What do you expect?  We're not talking oscar worthy movies here....we're talking about car chases and blowing things up...that is a DIE HARD movie.  It is exactly what you expect from this movie.  I loved it!  Of course I am a huge fan of Jai Courtney since 2010's Spartacus: Blood and Sand so that helps.  But in all honesty, this is not supposed to be a realistic movie, it's action, fun, blowing things up, awesome!  Someone made a comment about Russia being laid back and no police being around....ummm....hello?  IT'S A MOVIE!!  And then someone else said it was nothing like the other DIE HARD movies....so did you want him to save Holly from yet another terrorist situation?  Wouldn't that be worse than trying something different?  The kids all grown up...Jack is CIA.  Myself, I like that we are now seeing how Jack and Lucy turned out.  You know what you're going to get when you watch a DIE HARD movie so either don't watch it or don't complain about it.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|I loved the movie Pacific Rim and this soundtrack does a good job bringing the action back to mind when I listen. While not an epic soundtrack, it is a pretty good one by Ramin Djawadi, the composer for the Game of Thrones. If you are a fan of the movie and sountracks, this might be a good buy. I still think it should be called &#34;Songs to HIT Monsters with BOATS!!!&#34;
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Very well written show.  I had to look around for which episode i watched last because this is not in the same order as the version I was watching.  Turns out I have quite a few episodes to watch now :)
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Does what is needed from it. Solid app. Easy to understand and utilize. Helps with organization on a daily basis.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I got it for my nephew...you get one character, no customizable options and one game. EVERYTHING else is Downloadable Content (DLC)...EVERYTHING. If don't you buy anything, the game is a waste of time. If you want to enjoy anything, you have to pay.
B002WTX7XO|3.0|I didn't really get it.  I was waiting for the big, heroic, cure-finding finish, but it didn't happen.  A little too realistic, with not enough story.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I liked the movie because it explained how the wizard got to Oz. The color and landscapes were amazing. It filled in a lot of blanks left from the 1938 version. I recommend it to anyone.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|It's kitschy; it's nostalgic; it's fun. Also it has the greatest color scheme any TV show has ever had. And Kirk.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I watched this show on TBS as it was airing... it is so good I've been following it weekly. Now my wife is interested and I'm so glad it is available on Amazon Prime so she can catch up. Without a doubt best SyFy show on TV since Battlestar Galactica...
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I recamend you play this game I really do! Its really fun getting dinosaurs and WOLVES! Play it Play it! The only thing wrong to me is you need to buy peanuts to get things faster not really getting them by missions.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's so fun and challenging. I play it all the time. Totally a great game. The minions are like on temple run just cool other features!!!!  :):):):):)!!!!!
1852691263|3.0|This book was hard to find in the larger size and English; so we had to go with Chinese and English.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Its really easy to tell time, set a alarm and tell the weather.I would say its the best app to do all these things
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|You wouldn't think a another show about lawyers, corporate lawyers at that, would be so entertaining but it is! The characters have fast talking banter with tons of pop culture reference (mostly films), are manipulative and underhanded but have these raw, sincere moments that completely win you over. The show finds a perfect balance of showing you the cases and who the characters are in their personal life. You wont be weighed down with legal jargon either! Season 2 keeps you on the edge of your seat and laughing at all the great Mike and Harvey moments.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it. I didn't want it to end but I live the way it does. It's the first book that I have actually read the epilogue in.
1433502410|5.0|It's an updated version of the New International Bible, and very like it. But the references and footnotes are superior. It's the perfect study Bible. I like the leather-bound edition, but it's too heavy to carry around. It's strictly my study Bible and there is none better. (I am a Bible study teacher).
B0095MVOMC|4.0|It is a quick and challenging game that you can play if you have just a few minutes to spare.
1597801585|5.0|Brilliant dealing with today's issues. Does it unnoticeably while still being horrific. Great futuristic world. Great imagination. Hope there are more in the series coming.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Tangled is very different from all the other romance books.  It told by the man and his point of view is very unlike the usual story.  It's also funny and he becomes, as the story goes on, very loveable.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Never before or since has a movie been this quirky, funny, poignant and rewarding.  An unlikely matchup sure to win your heart.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|First of all great game one of the best I have ever played, I have congratulate the people that made this. It's definitely got me addicted to it. The only thing the bugs me is that how much the extra heroes cost and why is it required to use certain heroes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like having so many versions and translations available in one place. Will be interesting to have it in Church and Bible study. I like have such a compact &#34;Bible&#34; readily at hand. I also love the ability to listen as well as read at the same time. Helps to stay focused on the message.
B004TI1WME|5.0|Perfect as an easy to use calculator. The low price was worth paying for the PRO version to remove the ads.
B0052Z0MJW|2.0|I expected the plot to be a bit out there in typical Dan Brown still, however the description of the inner workings of the NSA is so dumbed down as to make this painful reading for anyone with exposure to cryptography above the level of morse code.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|I would rather try a limited free addition of an app, this one included to see if it suits my needs and then go for the full paid version if I'm happy. I DO NOT like the deceptive tactics that this app uses. Otherwise it would be an awesome product
B000JML90Y|4.0|I am struck by how comprehensively well thought out Darwin's treatise is, and how well presented, building the theory up piece by piece.  As much as we've continued to discover the mechanisms of biology and evolution since, the original work still serves as a foundation for all the concepts.
B008RTE066|5.0|I got this one at very good price from Amazon, MMT is a very very weak movie but it has maybe one of the best OST of all the time. The package is really nice, thanks to Amazon for the price.
1416550550|5.0|This was a fun read with good historical context and plotting, despite a slightly weak/naive protagonist. End Notes provided interesting details about the book's conceptualization and construction. Wish I had read those first, but not necessary to enjoy this ride through horrific and hopeful pre-Civil war events. Hope there is a sequel coming.
B00475BUVM|3.0|THE MOVIE IS KIND OF OK, SO'S THE 3D. OLD STORY ONLY SHOT IN 2D TO 3D. NOT TOO BAD,BUT NOT THAT GREAT.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This app is disappointing after using the iPhone app.  Why is the iPhone app so much better than the PC web page for this web site and for the Kindle HD app.  Much harder to repin what you like.  It shouldn't be that hard.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The games features minions and bananas! I'm a huge fan of Despicable Me.It's good for children to adults. Great stuff!
B00407PNWO|5.0|None of the other movie version can stand up to this classic take of Robin Hood.  Good for the whole family and a favorite of my granddaughter.  This is good for the entire family.  It may not stay true to history but there isn't that much to go on about Robin Hood to start with so run with it.  Flynn at his best with an outstanding cast.
B0047DVHV2|5.0|Very interesting read and gives a great insight into an eventful life both good and bad. Highly recommend this. Couldn't put it down.
B003ZHVJFK|1.0|Horrible Horrible Horrible movie!!!!<br /><br />Okay, if you are a fan of any of the actual source material don't bother with this movie, this movie serves no point in existing, I can't even accept this movie as an alternate reality for the Tekken World. The reason this review is so harsh and unforgiving is because unlike other gaming franchise movies, like Street Fighter, or Resident Evil, or even the poorly adapted Super Mario Bros, Tekken's world is deeply routed in realism, not so much fantasy, like the fireball throwing worlds of Street Fighter. Also the Storyline is so simple to follow a child could write the screen play! A tournament is announced, winner is promised money and a chance at running the most powerful company in the world, people from around the world sign up, gritty underground battles occur, how can that become what this movie is?<br /><br />this movie feels like the post apocalyptic world of John Connor meets Never back down, and in none of the good ways, sprinkled with a little sensuous flare and a sorted coming of age story. No character backstories are used nor fully explained, female characters fight like they think they are hot, not as a REAL MARTIAL ARTIST TRYING TO TAKE HIS OPPONENT DOWN! Oh race is an issue for me, Kelly Overton, an American girl with a tan plays Christie Monteiro a woman who is Brazilian in the games, Yoshimitsu gives a guess appearance as well as a few others, but its lackluster. Also a random threesome with Anna, Nina, and Kazuya occurs in an attempt at making Kazyua look like a boss....<br /><br />Just as an actual movie it screams \\"Scifi Original\\" but as an adaptation it FAILS EPICALLY!! Don't waste you're time, play the games, wait for some director that give a crap to do it justice, also check out youtube videos there are a few that capture the essence of the game better than this movie!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show is so beautifully shot with some serious heavy hitters for the actors.  It has become a terrible, terrible addiction.  Love it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the characters and the way Hosseini wove the plot, sometimes in a space we hadn't been taken before. What a marvelous imagination.  I was so satisfied when I finally closed the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just cannot wait for the 4th Season of Downton Abbey! Love the show!! Highly addictive, beautifully shot...and what a fantastic talent!
B004TMPJP6|4.0|Gets better with each update and I am used to it so I am sticking with it. I am sure there are other good list apps out there. Here's what this one does well:<br />- syncs b/w all you devices<br />- can set due dates<br />- can do sub-lists on items in a list and notes as well
0679805273|5.0|My son's professor read this book to the graduating class just before their final presentation so I got a copy him. He's 22. Dr. Seuss crosses generations.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game!!!<br />I play it all the time, my friends and family think I might be addicted. Thank you
