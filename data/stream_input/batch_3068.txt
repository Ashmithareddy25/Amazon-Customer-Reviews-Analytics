B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love the original &#34;Shining&#34; and this one is a great one too! Love to see him continue this story line since the book was left with an opening to continue.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Very good.  This is what I like.  It kept me guessing.  I was wishing it to be a longer story though.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm really enjoying CC on my kindle but I'm frustrated by crashes and failure to recognize that levels have been completed. I've also purchase boosters that don't register or game restarts after I've invested in extending session. These events waste my money and time!
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|This game started out fun to play but when they take all you coins it sucks. Then you have to email and try hard to get your coins back. Still waiting for an answer.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Best TV show out right now kudos to Ryan Murphy on scaring us to death, another hit for Glee creator awesome
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This so far is a fun game to play I have had no problems with it. Wish I could get more than 5 lives at a time.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I love it so far!  It's not super complicated to figure out and it is a lot of fun!!!  Good times
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|First, I should start by saying that I am not your typical 'target demographic' A7X fan in that I am a 40-something year old female.  However, I *am* a hard-rockin' 40-something female...and when I discovered this band about 6 years ago (heard City of Evil and my jaw dropped open on about every song), I was instantly in love.  Like any hard rock/metal band, this band has grown and changed as it's members have grown and changed, and that is a good thing.  You can't stay 20 forever, and the evolution of A7X's music reflects that.<br /><br />So here they are, most of the band members at or nudging their 30's, and it's time to pay tribute to the bands they themselves listened to as kids. It's time to give credit where credit is due - something that A7X has never found difficult.  Seriously, for a group of young guys who have achieved what they have achieved, they have always retained their humility, and it's only one of a long list of attributes I love about these guys:  they remember where they came from and those in their lives who have influenced their work, whether that be old friends and band-mates, fans, and in this case, artists they enjoyed in their youth and tried to emulate.<br /><br />There is a lot about this album to love.  M. Shadows sounds fantastic, and as usual, Synyster Gates and Zachy Vengeance produce some jaw-dropping guitar work.  We all still miss The Rev (of course) and know he is indispensable, but Arin is coming along quite well:  he has huge shoes to fill, but I think his work here is very good (though not amazing yet...and certainly not The Rev's...but then, whose would be?) and is likely to get even better as he integrates himself into a band that is just as much a family as it is a band.<br /><br />Obvious influences that I believe the guys are paying tribute to here are Metallica (the most obvious), ACDC and Guns & Roses.  I also detect a pinch of Iron Maiden in there, but it might just be me.  Don't get me wrong - the songs on this albumare totally original, and are completely worthy of the larger A7X catalog...but I think that this album definitely achieves it's purpose as a tribute album.  In short, it's a nice balance of maintaining their originality and paying tribute to the bands they love(d).<br /><br />My personal favorite songs (so far) are Hail to the King (love the guitar work), Crimson Day (once again proving that songs like Dear God and So Far Away were not flukes and that this band can write and play an excellent ballad!), Heretic, Coming Home (both hard-driving rockers), and Acid Rain (see comment about Crimson Day).  It was also good to hear Papa Gates once again - so glad they are including him since, like father-like son, he is a brilliant guitarist.  No screamo on this record, so don't expect another God Hates Us...but I'm okay with that as personally, I think it would disrupt the 'flow' of this particular record.  Plus, I personally like to believe that the lack of God Hates Us-like screamo might mean that they are coming to terms with their horrible loss and are moving past at least the 'rage' portion of their grief - something that has understandably been very difficult.  But hey...time heals everything, you know?  And I think all of their fans want that for them.  This band let their fans in on their grief in a very public manner (something we all appreciated and even cherished, I think!), and maybe this is a signal to us that while things will never be the same, the guys are moving in the direction of healing.  Personally, I really wish that for them.<br /><br />Long story short, A7X hit it out of the ballpark with this record.  Until now, my favorite A7X albums (in order) were City of Evil, Nightmare, and Self-titled.  This effort has already surpassed Self-titled and might just move up in my personal ranks as I continue to listen.<br /><br />Well done, guys!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I gave this a four star rating because it is a John Corey story and I like this character but I did not give it five stars because the story line did move a bit slow at first. Generally speaking that is okay with the John Corey series because he is so entertaining but I was hoping for a little more action.  I learned more than I need to know about life in Yemen a place I never want to go to.  The character John Corey is a no holds barred shoot from the hip man’s man.  That is appealing to anyone frustrated with terrorism in today’s world.  In that sense the story line is timely and the character John Corey is entertaining. I recommend this book for anyone who likes heroes who try to make the world a better place even if it is fiction.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is a cute sic-fi Western with six-guns, cattle rustling---from planet to planet of course, a new twist on prostitution and just about all of the other typical Western themes.  It's a fun series.  The only problem is that the good guys do not wear white hats.  What's up with that?!?!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is fun for all ages my 19year old sister plays this game its so much fun you would like it as much as I do
0316055433|5.0|I was certainly engrossed by this thrilling, sprawling novel.  The writing is luscious and captivating.  Even when the inevitable plot-advancing coincidences start to pile up, you are so relieved that our heroes, Theo and Boris, are able to stay with you another day.  It's quite odd to read a book of 770 pages and, when asked what it's about, to say &#34;Oh, a boy who loses his mother, goes to live with various people and has a lot of adventures.&#34;  While the comparisons to Dickens have been made, I also saw a close literary connection to Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.  It's the detail, the moods, the artistry, the beauty that makes The Goldfinch so compelling.  Just the act of spinning an entire saga from such a small and delicate painting is remarkable and miraculous.  I may forget the details of the novel in time, and am perhaps already forgetting them (the scenes in Amsterdam were exhausting), but I will never forget the little goldfinch, chained to its perch, that provoked this literary fantasia.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The movie is entertaining and the 3d is very good. I have not used the other modes, because the 3d is much better.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A great book!  It is a very easy read with an absolutely amazing story and phenomenal perspective.  If you have ever wondered about &#34;life after death&#34; or angels or spirits or what happens after we pass from this life, you MUST read this book!  Again, awesome!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I find this APP to be a great help.  Have not had any negatives at all.<br />  I would highly recommend it.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|I love Stephen King's older books and &#34;IT&#34; is one of my favorites.  He builds great characters and then drags you in kicking and screaming to this bizarre little town and it's scary secret...  Definitely worth the read if you can take it.
B00632HWOG|2.0|New format is harder to use than old.  You can't read the chains as well, or sort as easily. And certain features are incompatible with older browsers.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|There is nothing better than finding out what happens to a character after a beloved story ends and Stephen King as usual doesn't dissapoint. I always hate when a book that I love ends and here is a way for at least one to go on. Highly recommended I can never get enough King he is at the top of his game.
B002M85TH2|5.0|Alongside movies, such as Face/Off and Battlefield Earth, this movie is one of John Travolta's best movies as a bad guy!
B003U51D58|5.0|it had a slow start but an exceptionally well written story. you'll be on the edge of your seat wondering what happens next. it's awesome that you can watch as many as you want without commercials and waiting for the week to come around again
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This was a very good book with lots of action and drama in the mix. The ending was drawn out a little bit but it was enjoyable
B006GWO5NE|4.0|It is nice to have a longer cable than the standard 3ft. 2ft might not seem like much, but it makes a world of a difference when you are trying to use it while charging!<br /><br />This product seems to charge at about the same rate as any other cable.<br /><br />If you only have the 3ft cable, I'd recommend upgrading if you use your Kindle constantly!
B003KK65KG|4.0|An absorbing read into the effects of guns being too readily available in USA.  Looking at the outcome for all parties involved in a tragic school shooting gives an insight into the everyone's input into a young person's life.  Life is very fragile and everyone here ended up being a victim.  I wish the gun lobby group would try and see this story for what it is - a plea to stop having guns available and legal.  The only thing guns do is kill.  Nothing else.  That is all.
B0087EACJK|4.0|For $0.99, the game was fairly nice. The graphics looked pretty decent/smooth and there wasn't any significant flaws with gameplay.<br /><br />The game itself felt pretty original in concept and I loved how the puzzles functioned.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|He is a master of words and at tying in past novels with the present one......In this case we are revisiting memories of The Shining.  I'm half way through the book and can barely put it down. STEPHEN KING...........is a master of this craft................no holds barred.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As engrossing as the first book, with more clever images and depth of conflict. I'm diving into the third book today
006202406X|1.0|Okay huge spoiler<br /><br />Sooooo on what planet does a YA author kill off there protagonist. I was so excited for this book and couldn't be more disappointed. The book as a while was boring. I will usually stay up all night reading a new book. This book took me four days to get through because I had no problem setting it down after reading only a few chapters. There is no character development of the secondary characters who haven't been already killed off. I only hope the movie script writer are able to change this rotten ending. I'm seriously depressed for Tobias! This sucks!

B004RZGUBM|5.0|I always felt like I should have read more Dickens. I had only read a Christmas Carol. I loved the illustrations and images of first editions. When I first encountered typographical errors I thought they might have been in the original manuscript, but eventually realized that they resulted from inaccurate scanning of the text. (Those old copy editors were very good.)  Some books are affected more than others, and it would have been nice to have a way of sending corrections back to the publisher. Be prepared to spend a lot of time with this if you plan to read it all; it took longer than War and Peace!

Great job by the author.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|CC is addictive. Game play changes often enough so you don't get bored. One minute you have to crush jellies, next you have to diffuse bombs or bring down ingredients etc.<br />Super Duper cool:)
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It is awesome and very realistic i wish the guns looked more cooler like wooden and with actual brands but overall it is awesome!!!  IT IS THE BEST
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I've always been a fan of Ms. May, but have never bought one of her albums because they all seem to contain the same core tunes with a few extra to differentiate things.  If you don't have an album, this is a good one to get as it covers the &#34;hits&#34; that everyone has heard and is rounded out with a nice mix of other material.  It's a daily play for me.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|I enjoy Malcolm Gladwell and enjoyed this book.  Unfortunately, it starts off quite poorly with the David and Goliath story, which feels like a significant stretch.  The chapter on girl's basketball was excellent.  Most of the other chapters were quite engaging and interesting, including the one about impressionist painters in the Salon and colleges. His writing style is still very good
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|My daughter is 21 now, so I can't really use her as an excuse to go see these sorts of movies at the theater anymore, but by golly this is a fine film.  Trying to watch it over the PS3, though, proved impossible (it has known issues with Am Prime films), but seemed okay on other devices.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Nice pace and very affordable. Can't wait for the next installment of the game. Hope this next one is as good as the first.

B00F30S0Y0|5.0|By now the world is taken by Arcade Fire. Every single song of every single album has so far been worth falling for. So when I heard them on SNL, I was very worried. I saw the video to Reflektor and was more worried. I heard the song three or four times and then realized I Can't stop listening to it. It is so powerful, it is always growing on me but wait let me stop you for a second, this is their stand out record. Do not, I beg you to not listen to this album, at least in the beginning with the intention of listening to just one or two songs, its more powerful than that.<br /><br />Every Arcade Fire album has every song you eventually fall in love with. I have just finished giving it my first listen. I cannot quite comprehend the subject matter just yet and maybe I have no intentions of. But wait let me take you through this album, now that I'm on my second listen.<br /><br />Reflektor - I feel the most outstanding quality of Arcade Fire has always been their ability to make music with such romanticized lyrics that you NEVER EVER TIRE of hearing them. I swear.  Reflektor was a very weird song the first time I saw the video, But it grows on you. David Bowie only sings a small part in the end, as in he quotes the sermon or rather repeats it along with Butler and that deadly melody.<br /><br />Here Comes the night time - undeniably and unpresumably so my favorite song on this album. Oh my God. The mixture of beats, the whole atmosphere, remember walking into a room with a party going on feeling of marvin gay's whats going on? ... This reverberates, redirects and transcends that sort of a feeling to music BUT ONLY  a million times more. \\"If theres no music in heaven then whats it for?\\" Forget it, its already stuck in my head, I can't get it out.<br /><br />WE EXIST - Great song when heard on album, not easy to cancer through otherwise for me initially.<br /><br />NORMAL PERSON -  \\"Is anything as strange as a normal person? Is there anything as cool as a normal person? I can't tell myself if I'm a normal person.\\" This is definitely the best singing Win Butler has blessed his listeners with. I dare say, vocally this might be RIGHT UP THERE WITH Black Mirror, Rebellion and Tunnels. Outstanding wall of sound. Arcade Fire explode out the gates at 160 MPH or so it seems. Reminiscent of their first album's second half for sure.<br /><br />PORNO - *No words to explain*<br /><br />There is only one thing I would like to say in conclusion. A writer writes about his life or someone else's life. There are stories, true or untrue. A film maker creates a dream weaving effect where he unfolds a series of events.  A musician however has nothing to hide, he is not acting at any time or reciting anything but that he feels. There is no form of embezzelemn or dazzle at display but just his voice. Arcade Fire and their music is a celebration of music itself. There is no one close to their formula. It is the kind of authorial clarity of their lyrics, or the mind numbing guitars, the voice overs, the production, the echo, symphony of their orchestra, the entire composition is very well formed. I can't wait to see them again on concert.<br /><br />My own qualm was a surprise they threw at me. I do wish there was a song like Sprawls ii on this record because I love it when the wife sings.I can't tell myself if I'm a normal person.\\" This is definitely the best singing Win Butler has blessed his listeners with.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Danny Boyle knows how to tell a good story, and his direction an vision are truly showcased in this film. Its a feel good movie with some not so feel good parts. To me that is a sign of a good movie, one that pulls at all the strings.
B0072V39DK|1.0|Thought this might be a good spaghetti western but it is almost unwatchable. Guess I am holding it up to too high of a standard by comparing it to those of Sergio Leone, and his &#34;Man With No Name&#34; films.
B00004ZKVM|4.0|First off: Don’t be fooled by the odd Album Cover Image that might appear above. If you look at the other offerings in the section, you’ll see a cover displaying a cool watercolor abstract of Morrison and the other Doors… This is indeed that record.<br /><br />Now, onto the Review:<br />For Vinyl Junkies only (being as it was never issued on CD), this wonderful, not-so-hard-to-find ’72 double record set is a well-balanced, well-selected, excellently paced Overview that acts as a kind of counterpart to the 1970 “13” album (also never issued to CD)…<br /><br />A Bit of History with some Opinions Sprinkled in:<br />I’m always a little amazed at the tremendous historical pop-culture adoration the Doors seem to command… Particularly for what is (on close inspection) a kind of a spotty track record. If you REALLY start listening to the entire Morrison/Doors LP’s (or CD’s) in chronological order, things can get tedious fast. Krieger himself admitted in a number of interviews that they knew they only had enough material for two and a half records at the time of their signing. And with Elektra President Jac Holzman nixing the idea of “Celebration of the Lizard” taking up the entire second side of the “Waiting For The Sun” LP, they were flat-out scrambling for material to fill that release… but I’m getting ahead of myself;<br /><br />With regards to their Debut album, I once read that “the promise of the first record was never fulfilled”; This is a very prophetic statement… (although to me, the sophomore “Strange Days” is actually their best all-around effort; through the years, it’s the one I always seem to gravitate back to).<br />The aforementioned third album (“Waiting For The Sun”) revels the group running out of gas, while “Soft Parade” is not only the weakest in their cannon, it’s also one of the WORST albums in rock history. The surviving band members have defended this record by saying that everybody was using horns at that time - but the crux of the matter is, that whole “brass” thing SO flew in the face of their original musical statements that it now seems like a total sell-out.<br />Regrouping and going almost in a sideways (bluesy) direction, “Morrison Hotel” was not only an amazing come-back, but one of the GREATEST albums in rock history. Then, while the band was catching it’s creative breath, Electra issued the superior, underrated “Absolutely Live!”. Painstakingly edited from a number of concert performances throughout ‘69-‘70, this is a standout record: Not only would the listener have no idea that this was seamlessly spliced together from so many sources (think about doing THAT with scissors and recording tape in the pre-digital age), it also shows the Doors trying to create a true atmosphere for the fans at their appearances, as opposed to just running through a greatest hits set and splitting. Also released at this time was the above-mentioned “13”, a kind of “Best Of” up to this point (but billed as “…13 Classic Doors Songs”).<br />Persuaded to sign up for one more release, the band produced the enigmatic “L.A. Woman”, which could be viewed as either “they’ve still got it!”, or “boy, they went out in style!”<br /><br />Which brings us back to 1972’s  “Weird Scenes Inside the Goldmine”. If you don’t want to have to go through all the valleys just to experience the peaks, this is a fine overview (and nicely mixed up chronologically, to boot!).
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I wanted so badly to say how in love with this series I am/was but I can't because this book took the entire series and threw it to the trash. I want to just say oh well another crappy book but for some reason this one is really bugging me. Why? Why kill Tris? All it did was give you a crappy ending to a mediocre book. Why not have her pull away from death, maybe have her see her parents together, dead together, but pull away, pull close to Tobias? It could have gone back to the first time she grabbed his hand, the electricity that brought them together...<br />Ugh. I have no desire to see these movies and I will never re-read the series. HUGE disappointment.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|OK, that's really a three and a half. Usually I would give a book or anything else a four on amazon for the 3&1/2, but not this book, definitely not this book. I'm afraid the piece is just too poorly written. There are too many confounding moments. There are points where I don't have ANY idea what the author is talking about, but must merely assume. I also don't find the story all that interesting, nor do I find the morals or lessons very clear.<br /><br />Ok, so to sum up the book, we're reading about hedonism? Devotion to pleasure of the senses. Like another reviewer wrote somewhere, the man's debasement isn't explicated in action, which is I think a trademark of the poorest of authors. I myself am guilty of such a thing from time to time, I'm not saying writing action parts is easy. But the mere reading of a book is supposed to have made Dorian Gray devolve into some kind of beast? I'm sorry, but that's a bridge too far.<br /><br />Not that there aren't wonderful parts and points in this book, or that it isn't worth reading. There's quite a bit of Wildeian wit here to satisfy the most selfish, and for me there's more than a handful or two of lines that I'll be carrying with me from this very book. However, it's not a well crafted, or well paced book. We have here a fine fancy weekend read. I recommend it to all, just don't go in expecting the thing to carry on the rapaciousness of the first few chapters. Things really do slow down as the book drives on, leaving the author to drone on and on in certain places about this or that in the most insincere, witty, obscure language anyone could imagine. You'll have a tough but fun, I suppose, time figuring out all these riddles. If the overall intelligence of Oscar Wilde doesn't impress you his vain, haughty prose will.<br /><br />I think I remember The Importance of Being Earnest being a lot better, but this was a cool enough intro into the world of Wilde's bigger projects. I can see where the old criticisms are coming from, for indeed it's a malformed book.<br /><br />Yet the moralism of these old blatherers will just make you laugh. I don't catch hardly a hint of Wilde's 'adventurous' lifestyle in these pages, unless you relate characters to pictures on google images.<br /><br />Hint: Oscar is Henry and Lord whatshisname is Dorian Gray
0937381888|5.0|Buy this book and you can brew beer. The first chapter teaches the instructions of how to make your first batch. The next chapters explain the process in depth. After two years of brewing, there is still plenty of stuff I have to read over multiple times to begin to understand. Great knowledge for how to brew. Should be the first book you buy.

B002S43V3Y|4.0|I remember watching this long ago and enjoying it. It had more of an affect on me back then but is still an entertaining movie if you enjoy quirky black humor. Some may see it as a little slow moving but the characters are unique and draw you into the story. Good message about finding oneself in life.
B00B52F278|5.0|This movie is great I bought the first season of Spartacus with Andy Whitfield it was the best movie I have ever seen I'm a movie critic. Andy was great in this movie. I was so sad when he passed away, then I thought that no one can take hi place. Then they came out with the third season with Liam McIntyre this movie was great Spartacus war of the damned. He is a good actor but we can never replace Andy. Great job Liam

0199676461|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo3LZ9TLPSJP8J8]]<br />ON ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR)<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Published recently by the Oxford University Press, this new work of reference on Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) has been endorsed and welcomed by leading judges and practitioners. It is already acquiring its fair share of accolades.<br /><br />Appropriately it has been named `The Jackson ADR Handbook' following on as it does from the Jackson reforms.  It is the direct result of Sir Rupert Jackson's recommendation that an authoritative handbook for ADR should be produced and indeed this is apparently the first book to focus exclusively on ADR.<br /><br />Writing in the Foreword, Lord Dyson, MR credits Professor Frank Sander of Harvard University as a pioneering and pivotal influence in promulgating ADR as a means of resolving disputes back in 1976. The development of ADR in England and Wales has been facilitated by his work, as have, for example, the Woolf Reforms and the Civil Procedure Rules, as well as Sir Rupert's Costs Review.  The result, in the words' of Lord Dyson is that `ADR is now a well-established part of every lawyer's practice,' adding that `the effective promotion of ADR is unquestionably in the public interest.'<br /><br />The Handbook has therefore been produced for an audience of judges and lawyers as well as litigants. The fact that it is as useful for interested lay people as it is for legal professionals attests to its clarity, conciseness and accessibility. Even a cursory glance at the detailed table of contents should persuade anyone concerned with, or interested in ADR that this Handbook covers the subject in virtually every conceivable aspect from every conceivable angle.<br /><br />The book is divided into six sections, covering general principles through to mediation, negotiation and the often controversial matter of enforcing settlement.  The uncertainties of ADR, CPR and litigation are also examined in Section 2, including such issues as `refusing to engage in ADR Processes' involving `unreasonable refusal to consider ADR'.

These, according to the author, were intended as a continuation of the series of articles by Sir Gerald Fitzmaurice in the Year Book from 1950 to 1963.  It is also pointed out that Sir Gerald's study came to an end when he himself was elected as a judge of the ICJ in1960 and was therefore not able to comment in the same way on its decisions.<br /><br />What this current two-volume work therefore achieves is to assemble the salient articles logically and systematically into a complete edition.  The author, Hugh Thirlway, who has been intimately involved with  the work of the ICJ, has certainly succeeded in his stated aim to make this body of work more accessible `in a form in which the relationships between the various subjects examined and the chronological development of the Court's case-law would be more evident.'<br /><br />Here then, within two volumes and over 2,000 pages, is an overview of the law and the procedures of the International Court of Justice, over some fifty years of its history. The book thus reveals the development of international legal rules based, in large part, on decisions and on treaties which have originated with the Court.<br /><br />Examining the work of the ICJ with care and detail, this monumental work could be regarded as the basis of the first real attempt to evolve a set of international rules founded on the jurisprudential implications of its work over what has proved to be a highly significant period of legal history.<br /><br />This formidable work of reference is organised first into sections and then into categories labelled as `divisions'.  Note these in the two tables of contents: one a summary, the other detailed -- a useful feature in itself.<br /><br />To cite only a few examples, the first volume includes a section on general principles and sources of law, as well as treaty interpretation and other issues, including substantive law and questions of jurisdiction and competence and of procedure.  Volume II examines similarly diverse material under similar categories.  Also note here the highly interesting division on the Law of the Sea which covers such subject areas as maritime spaces, delimitation and much more.<br /><br />With its numerous references to case law, its extensive footnoting and detailed index, this is primarily a highly technical and eminently useful work of reference for international lawyers keen to develop a broader and certainly deeper understanding of this complex and evolving area of law.  With all this and its extensive tables of cases and statutory instruments, this two-volume work should be regarded as a highly useful addition to the international lawyer's library.

And here it is, now in a new third edition.  Of major benefit to the practitioner is the Handbook's accessibility, practical straightforward approach and readability.  Here in one compact volume you'll find the essentials of company law covered not only in detail, but augmented too, to offer more thorough coverage and to impart greater depth and understanding. 67<br />In a complex subject area such as this, the Handbook functions as an essential guide, reference book and research resource.<br /><br />Heading a team of learned contributors, the author, Professor Stephen Griffin, a specialist in corporate law has written widely in this subject and has had his work cited by the courts and in official publications. He explains that the primary legislative source for this work is the consolidated Companies Act 2006, and related statutory instruments.<br />In over 22 subject chapters the book explains all the relevant provisions of the 2006 Act and details of the resulting case law and the effects on established corporate law principles.  The principles derived from the decided cases, he adds, `are explained fully in the text -- and are presented together with working examples and extracts from court judgments.<br /><br />Note that this new edition contains a wealth of new material, including new chapters on directors' duties and liability, acquiring and dealing with shares in a public company, corporate governance and detailed introduction to corporate insolvency issues and procedures.<br /><br />Other areas of particular interest to practitioners include extended coverage of the criminal liability of corporations as well as a new section on the Bribery Act 2010.  Also note the new section on the key developments relating to corporate personality and the corporate veil, as well as the chapters, for example, on taxation and share dealing.<br /><br />In short the Handbook covers every salient aspect of company law and opens up new avenues of inquiry for the researcher, including over forty-five pages of tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and international legislation.  For ease of use the detailed index at the back can be cross referred to the numbered paragraphs throughout. As well as practitioners and students, anyone charged with the responsibility of running a company will find this book absolutely essential.

In which case, you will welcome the recent publication of this book from the Oxford University Press as being just the in-depth examination you may well have been looking for as to the powers and duties of protectors.  However, if you are not entirely familiar with the concept of `protector of trusts' this book will enlighten you.  Either way, the book is particularly helpful to those involved in international law.<br /><br />As author Mark Hubbard explains, the book `considers protectors in the context of what has been termed international trust law as, it is argued, it applies to international trusts.' adding that the book `does not set out to provide a  comprehensive statement of the law of any one of the two dozen or so jurisdictions that are mainly referred to.'<br /><br />Yes, the book does cover -- or touches on -- just about all the offshore jurisdictions you can think of, from Anguilla to San Marino, the Seychelles and the Turks and Caicos Islands.  Malaysia, Malta and Mauritius are also included.  A very useful volume this, for anyone with clients involved with offshore trusts.<br /><br />That said, the author states that the book is not about tax, as tax issues are specific to the individuals and the relevant jurisdictions involved.  Rather, in the words of the author, the book is intended `as a comprehensive practitioner work... academically rigorous and practical in its approach'.<br /><br />As pointed out by Hayton J's Foreword, the use of protectors has expanded dramatically over the last forty years, thus requiring practitioners to become fully aware of the issues resulting from their use.  Apparently though, there was little or no mention of protectors in the standard references on trusts until about 1995.  Hubbard reveals that he had the idea for this particular topic while in the Bahamas engaged in litigation involving protectors. The recent publication of this book by OUP is therefore nothing if not timely.<br /><br />A `protector' of course is tasked with a number of responsibilities referred to in this book and may generally be defined, according to the author's suggestion as `generally speaking, a person or company appointed by the settlor (of the trust) to reflect his views whilst being legally independent of the settlor.'  `A protector is thus envisaged,' adds the author, `as protecting the settlement either from the trustees, or from the unintended consequences of giving the trustees wide powers for deliberately undefined or ill-defined objects.'<br /><br />Clear, succinct and approachable, the book covers the various powers and duties assigned to protectors, together with related issues, including indemnity and remuneration... liability... litigation by and against protectors... and more. And for your further research, there are extensive tables of cases, and statutes, a detailed index and three appendices.<br /><br />For those practicing in this increasingly important aspect of international law, this authoritative volume should be regarded as an indispensable acquisition.

What a time saver, especially when you need to be signposted in the direction of further topics for research, both on the Internet and in printed material!<br /><br />Not only is this volume a useful guide to the adjudication process, it is also a tremendous help in the drafting of contracts.  Considering the complexity of the material and the issues involved, the book should get full marks for its logical layout and general accessibility.  There is both a table of contents and a detailed table of contents which certainly facilitates looking things up when you're under pressure.  Those involved in payment disputes will appreciate the in-depth examination of enforcement and enforceability, the core of the book in our view.<br /><br />Written and compiled by four acknowledged experts whose experience and technical knowledge spans virtually all aspects of this field (including defence, energy and IT), the book also functions as a handy research resource.  There are almost thirty pages of tables of cases and legislation, plus four appendices and a detailed index.  Those involved in any aspect of adjudication within the construction industry, whether practitioners, adjudicators or students will find this book invaluable.

Which is why, when you acquire this new and updated edition, you know you're being guided by experienced hands.<br /><br />As Silverman points out, the past year in conveyancing may well have been a quiet one, except for the fact that a large number of small but significant changes have occurred in conveyancing practice.  Examples of such changes included new practice notes on anti-money laundering... joint ownership... flood risk... guidance on identity... bogus firms and the new law on squatters.  Then there's the new edition of the Consumer Code for Home Builders and also information on the Green Deal, as well as the regular updating of statute and case law.  Note in addition, the latest Finance Bill and revisions to the Law Society Property Information Form - and much more besides.<br /><br />Within its more than 1200 pages and ten sections, plus ten appendices, the Handbook -- which is actually quite a compact volume -- divulges a wealth of relevant information, all covered straightforwardly and in detail, from preliminaries such as taking instructions and financial services through to exchange, pre-completion, leaseholds, commonhold, delay, remedies and costs, to cite only a few examples.<br /><br />If you're conducting further research into the legislation pertaining to matters with which you're involved, note also that the handbook contains at least forty pages of tables of cases, statutes and statutory instruments and also a table of European and International Law.  In all, this is an indispensable acquisition for all conveyancers, particularly following the changes noted and examined in this brand new edition.

I have watched this film so many times and still enjoy it and they even honored Michael Caine who played in the original was honored by having a brief showing of him in this version.<br />Gives the word &#34;fine&#34; a whole new meaning and being in filmed in Venice and then the Italian Alps was over the top.

WHAT IS THE DEAL with this?  I only ask because I heard a lot of talk about these guys touting them as the next folk rock geniuses... then I listen to this stuff and I feel like I'm touting a million question marks. Like, what hyper active attention deficit five year old wrote these lyrics? Do they have any relevance to real life, and how much money did their parents give them to make this album?

B00BD99JMW|3.0|SOME SPOILERS AHEAD!!<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />Again, some spoilers in review.  Don't read and then say you weren't warned.<br /><br />I had a bad feeling from the beginning of the book when I saw it was broken into DUAL POVs.  I had a bad feeling for the main reason why it was being done.<br /><br />That aside, I have read several other books that have included other POVs either during the book or as a bonus at the end.  In other books there was a distinct difference of the characters voice, where I felt like I was getting to know the character in a whole different way.  This was NOT the case with Allegiant.  I'm feeling the same as some other reviewers I have seen:  That if there wasn't a \\"Tris\\" or \\"Tobias\\" at the beginning of the chapter, I wouldn't know who's head I was supposed to be in.  I came away not  knowing or feeling any more of Tobias from reading his perspective.  The sole thing I got was knowledge of events he was there for that Tris was not.<br /><br />This is the biggest thing I feel that Roth failed the readers on by doing dual POVs, people grew to love Tobias in the first two, not just because of his relationship with Tris but for his own character.  I would have loved to actually get inside his head and understand him more.  But that did not happen at all.  In fact I don't think feel like I learned much about either Tris or Tobias in Allegiant.<br /><br />The choppy dual POV made me feel like I was being told a summary of events, not going on a journey of these characters I grew to love in the first two books.  The first two were page turners where even when it wasn't pretty or I was nervous about where the story was going, I was invested and had to keep reading.  Allegiant felt like a chore to get through.<br /><br />In addition to the lack of character growth and interaction, I felt very let down by what was outside the city, what the big secrets were that Tris's parents and most of the Abnegation were fighting for, willing to die for.  The plot became very very messy with the video from Edith Prior that was introduced in Insurgent and stayed that way.<br /><br />I left feeling like Allegiant was a bait and switch from the first two books.  Same feeling I had when reading THG trilogy.  It switches from being character journeys to basically a hit over the head \\"lesson\\" and \\"message\\" that war is bad, government is corrupt, and that good people die unfairly.  Yes, all these things are true.  I don't feel the need for it to be pounded into my head from a fiction book to understand that.  I don't read books to be lectured I read them to be entertained.<br /><br />Now getting to the ending...without saying exactly what it is I was extremely let down with that as well.  I have read VR's blog on her reasons of why it had to happen, and I respect that she wrote the blog stating that she welcomes all opinions on the matter.  I just don't agree that it HAD to end the way it did.  Even though she says she did not do it for shock value, as a reader I can't help but feel that's the way it comes off, that it is VR's way of making her series memorable.  She also stated that she wasn't thinking about her audience when writing the ending.  But if you're willing to sell the rights to your books over to a film company, maybe that's something you should have considered.  There were other ways the story could have ended that would still show the pain and loss of the theme of the books.  The only redeeming part could have been the Epilogue, but even that feels empty character wise, and tons of plot holes just as the book was.  There wasn't enough meat to the story or the characters to justify it ending the way it was.  It didn't feel WORTH IT.  If it had been better written, I could have accepted the ending.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was a really great read. Though it may seem a bit rushed in the beginning it still had a lot of depth to it. The main reason why i wrote this review was because i was disappointed to see how few stars this book had.

While it centers on an accident at a nuclear missile silo it provides a much more in depth accounting to the hundreds of near disastrous lapses, and dangerous decisions made for the security of our nuclear arsenal.  You will learn many uncommonly know secrets of the designs and handling of nuclear weapons.  You will also learn of the lies the American public were told over the past 60+ years about the safeguards in place.  You will also learn of the lax handling of the &#34;Football&#34; by some of our presidents due to their perceived infallibility of the safeguards they believed in place (Which actually weren't)  You will learn of bombs jettisoned and never recovered, of plane crashes with nuclear weapons on board, of the refusal of the airforce to permit safety devices on &#34;Their bombs&#34; for fear the device might not explode when they wanted it to.  You will learn why up to 80 percent of the missiles we carried on our submarines as a first line deterrent wouldn't have worked if fired.  My only regret is that I bought it on the kindle instead of hardcover or paperback so I could share it with more friends.  It should be required in all libraries!!  Excellent.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|These are working great for us mixing our church services. We don't push the performance limits of headphones but if you need some quality built headphones that sound great, these are the ones!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best period drama going these days.  This show transports the audience back in time to another world.  I only wish I had someone bringing me a tiny glass of sherry on a silver tray while I watched...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I grew up with the ponies. I love this game and how cute it is. It has become a daily habbit and trip down memory lane.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I play this game on face book whenever i can so when it became available on the kindle I had to have it. i will say it is slightly different from face book but still fun to play and it helps pass the time in boring meetings.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King has done it again! Dr. Sleep is a brilliant and masterful follow-up to The Shining. Proving once again that he is the best writer of our generation!!!
0061440795|5.0|My intro to Existentialism began with Bonjour Tristesse.  It is a great read, portrays a certain societal stratum's ennui, dissoluteness,<br />and the relative ease with which they destroy others' lives (and their own), while seeming above the fray, conscienceless.  Apropos of today's 1%, I suppose...
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game very much. It helps me have something to do in my pass time. Thank you Gameloft and Hasbro for creating a good game.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King is an expert at scaring the crap out of you (me) - and this book was no exception!  I couldn't wait to carve out some time during the day/night to be able to read to see what was going to happen next - my family knows better than to try to interrupt me when I'm into one of his books!  And this one will grab you immediately and keep you turning the pages, even though you know you should be attending to your other responsibilities!  I thought it was the perfect sequel to The Shining (another favorite).

030758836X|2.0|This has been on the bestsellers' list for a long time and I waited until the price came down for a used copy. I'm glad I waited, I'm glad I read it, and I'm glad I put it in the Goodwill box. I didn't like it at all and I hated the ending.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just like the title...this game is crazy addictive , fun and keeps you busy for sure!!!  There is unexpected competition with my Facebook friends too.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Kept me interested throughout. The author uses humor & wit throughout with the story lines still being serious & interesting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read, to be completely honest. At the beginning of this book, I was very confused, and I wondered if I'd be able to even finish it. 10 pages later, I was hooked. The book thief is not just a story of death and of world war II, or even of the complications of hiding a Jewish man. It is a story of love and friendship, New beginnings and angst, comfort and understanding, and honesty in a way that's never been more honest. I recommend it to everybody.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Love the new Bible. Love how it gives you five to compare. Great app can't wait to see what's new/next.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over.  So many great lines and scenes if you are a superhero fan.
B00150W1K6|5.0|I recently realized with some dismay and disbelief that I had neither the CD nor mp3's of Downward Spiral. Thinking back I realized that the copy I remember rollerblading to school to back in the 90's was a tape I had made from a friends CD and who the hell knows where that got to. As for the mp3's? This was a time before they existed. It's hard to remember that such a time was actually a reality, but there it is.<br /><br />I thought about buying the normal version, but then I saw that this came with a whole disks worth of other songs and the music was remastered to be 5.1. Not that I have anything at the moment that comes close to surround sound, but I imagine someday I will and when that day comes I'm pretty sure the extra couple bucks will prove a tremendous investment.<br /><br />PS go to the gym with this on your mp3 player and you will do some damage.
B0078XFYDA|2.0|Having read other books written by Dawkins, including &#34;The God Delusion&#34; and &#34;The Blind Watchmaker,&#34; I was expecting a deeper discussion of science than is presented in &#34;The Magic of Reality.&#34;  He appears here to be writing to a younger audience with little or no familiarity with the subjects.  His take on cosmology in the book, not his area of expertise, is okay but not particularly enlightening or stimulating.  Not one of his best books but it is easy to read and may appeal to readers who just want a general high-level discussion.  For a better, and far more entertaining, overview of the sciences I recommend &#34;The Canon: A Whirligig Guide of the Beautiful Basics of Science&#34; by Natalie Angier.  Angier covers the range of sciences from microbiology to astronomy (I especially liked the latter) in information-packed chapters about each.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Actually I LOVED this book! I have never been brought to so many different emotions while reading a book. Holder made me mad, sad, furious, inanormed, happy, and hopeful. Sky and Holder have a past, present and future that a person is lucky to have at least one of in their lives. I cried, laughed, put the book down out of anxiety and anxiously picked it back up again. I couldn't read it fast enough! Thank you for providing your readers with such an emotional journey!
B001NLL93W|5.0|I started reading this so that I could share the experience with my 12-year-old granddaughter. I don't usually enjoy Young Reader books, but this one stands on its own. Although young, the characters are thoughtful, clever, and insightful. I'll read the entire series, as my granddaughter has. Good books!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad that candy crush is now available for kindle. I play it all the time. I like ho  it sinks up with Facebook too.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of my favorite holiday movies.  If you love Chistmas movies, this is one you will love and watch many times.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I first got this book I read it again as soon as I had finished it.  Great story, interesting characters and fascinating and chilling villains who look like ordinary RV folks.  I will never pass a line of RVs on the interstate again without thinking of this book.  The flawed hero is the grown up Dan Torrance from The Shining and there are many references to that book and what happened in it but you by no means will lose out if you have not read it before Dr. Sleep.  Buy it ..... you'll love it.
B0026YWQ4Q|4.0|A five star experience and a five star movie. My only reason for giving it 4 stars it the huge volume difference between dialogue and music. Volume has to be turned up very high to hear dialogue. Then, when music starts, you get blasted out of your seat.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I like this app very much.. it is very simple and fun to use..after working on my first photo i wanted to try it with the rest of mine..very cute..great for quick fixes
B0034DGPEU|2.0|Yes, the story carries you along, with one terrible tragedy after another befalling the simple, decent, honest, hardworking, beautiful slaves, generation to generation, invariably imposed upon them by evil, drunken, drug-addicted, lazy, mean, cruel whites masters.  Rapes, lashings, beatings, lynching, you name it.  Enough already.  Written at fifth-grade level, lacking artistry and complexity.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Enjoyed and watched again after all was made 'clear' at the end.  What's not to like about the 2 headliners.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|It I the best game ever and I especially like how u can disable the plane if your device won't pick up blowing all in all its a pretty look game
B0089LOG02|5.0|The story is well written .I could not put the book down.<br />Anyone who is interested in history and the lives that shape people<br />will love this book.
B000XXGMS8|5.0|this is the second time i have bought this boot, the first pair was a couple years ago, there are a few differences but seem to be of same quality. Use them for anything from everyday use to safari in africa!
B008EKON56|4.0|I have a phone mount in my car and an iPhone 5 with a case. Having a case restricts your options in cabling. The case I have (which mounts on in the slot loading CD player) the two supports at the bottom nearly cover up the headphone port on the iPhone 5 so I'd have to connect the cables first, then close the grips on the phone.<br /><br />With this handy adapter, I have my lightning to 30-pin adapter with this LOD attached. From there, I have my mini USB cable that goes to a Cigarette Lighter USB charger in front of the gearshit. and a 1/8&#34; headphone cable that goes to the AUX input in the center console of my Mazda 3.<br /><br />Instead of two cables that I need to connect and the misaligned iPhone mounted in the grips (due to the headphone jack placement). I now only have to connect this LOD with the power/audio cables coupled with the lightning to 30-pin adapter.
B0072NWJRK|2.0|I read through this entire story anticipating finding the murderer, you are not warned that the book is an account of the murder and the investigation without a solution.
B00FOU1O3S|3.0|I only played for a little while and got bored quickly. I loved it to play on my PC though!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|the only problem with this game is putting it down<br /><br />i have just finished the first round and have really enjoyed the challenge
B00EA8UEZ4|5.0|One thing I love about Gary Renard's 3 books is the no nonsense, tell it as it is approach. He is not afraid to say something that other authors might try to avoid. He is not trying to please or appease his readers. He is straight, strong and clear. That is his way and he has been inspired by the Holy Spirit in the form of his dear teachers, Arten and Pursah.<br />The fact that Pursah is his future self is, I think GREAT! I feel my 'future self' talking to me sometimes from outside of time and space reminding me of my journey 'home'. That fact could be an inspiration to others to feel that future self presence themselves.... and why not? Gary is not saying that his experience is the best or the only one, it is HIS experience, boldly and honestly written.<br />I LOVE a Course in Miracles, I feel its TRUTH and LOVE in my life as I practise its teachings. Gary is a good teacher in that he shares his personal self, warts and all to everyone. He is not pretending to be perfect and neither do we have to pretend that. He is committed to GOING HOME to God and as each of us that read his books know, he is a 'brother' given the task by Holy Spirit to help each of us go Home to God, too.<br />There are tips and warnings and experiences boldly shared in Love Has Forgotten No One, which have already helped me understand deeper my own thoughts and feelings about certain things, both in the Course and in my every day life.<br />Thank you, Gary for another great book given to the world to ponder upon and to help me meet the Christ within my own heart and mind.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Lots of fun, and constantly changing.  You will never run out of levels.  I dislike having to wait for energy to rebuild or having to buy coins and diamonds.  I have avoided it but it means having to play for a little bit, then leave it for hours to rebuild.  The prices are obscene for the coins/diamonds.  I like that you can ask others for items you are short on and can visit and gift items in return.  I wish there was a better explanation for how the whole game works, like the purpose of the monsters and the cursed rooms.  Worth the play.
B000GUJYRE|5.0|I have been listening to Beethoven performances, both recorded and live, for the past 60 years. I've heard and have on disc many, many performances. When I want to hear a recording for the past 5 years I don't reach for Toscanini, Karajan, Klemperer, Walter, Szell, Furtwangler, or Bernstein -to name a few of those I have on the shelf - I reach for this box.<br />It's nonsense to dislike this set because the tempos are fast. Beethoven's tempos are fast! It's nonsense to dislike this set because it's aggressive: Beethoven's music, albeit not all of it, is aggressive! How anyone can give these performances a low rating is beyond my comprehension.<br />And, in case you're wondering, I have not been an uncritical fan of Haitink, but now that I do think of it he has made great recordings of Debussy, Mahler, Strauss and others.<br />I certainly am not saying that the other conductors named above don't have excellent performances of this most universally appealing music. But, in sum, I believe it would be a very big missed opportunity to go through the rest of life without being able to hear this set.<br />Oh yes, did I mention: the sound is wonderful. I've played these discs on equipment ranging from the most expensive CD turntable available to a very moderately priced Marantz CD player and the effect is always the sound: amazing sound!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Personally, I love the original candy crush on King.com.  I think the saga thing it a little much but like the levels with new challenges.  I don't love the lives and being cut off for hours to re-up the lives.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was a surprisingly captivating page turner!  Great characters and plot development.  For anyone who read Gone Girl and liked it, you will love this.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Thank you, John Grisham, for continuing to write fascinating, interesting novels that are great from cover to cover!<br />In Sycamore Row, main characters from previous novels continue their lives in Ford County, Mississippi and confront issues of the law involving new people and situations. But, racism remains a central theme. And, certain questions keep the reader guessing until the very end!<br />I loved the journey!
B00AYB0VO0|5.0|One of the best scary movies of all time. No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|i didnt realize that this didnt open like a book (2 sides are zippered and 2 sides are sewn shut)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Great read hope to see another sequel. King is really on his game... As good as the first and I hope to see Danny again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting for what seems like forever for this game to be available for the kindle, I was so excited when it finally did! The only thing I don't like is having to wait 30 minutes for a new life. But other than that it's awesome! So much fun and addicting, I may forget what  the sun looks like LOL
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|great album only knew one of their songs until this album. Cant believe I have missed out on the great music this band puts out.
B001VU1NJ0|3.0|Maybe it wasn't my kind of movie.  I did like how the storyline wove all the people together, but I kept waiting to see if I would like it more or it would grab me more and it never did.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|A friend said that it was great, so I dove in and watched one a day for a while.<br />I was entranced! It was fun!<br />I really enjoyed this Dr. Who...better than the next one, and love Rose with her combination of naivete and determination.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Honestly it only got 4 stars because I love super heros.  The plot was predictable and I didn'f find any of the acting be the quality I have seen from these same folk in other movies.  Otherwise it really should get three.  Wasn't horrible wasn't great, a dead in the middle movie that I am glad to have seen on the little screen instead of the big.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The books were Sexy, Sultry, Intriguing, Mysterious and stimulating.  I would recommend them to most women.  Christian Grey is one  sexy man.
B0096YJDNQ|5.0|I was looking for an app for my Kindle HD that would show me the skies similar to Stellarium on my PC.  This app does it plus provides tools for locating deep space items, the planets, and let's me know what to expect for the next few weeks.  I feel I will be using this quite a bit as my Kindle is much easier to take to the field than my laptop.  A great buy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is my new guilty pleasure! I now have my husband my daughter and my son in law playing...I had to so I could ask for more lives and the train tickets to the next levels!
0143122916|5.0|It is completely unfathomable that \\"the World\\" permits the existence of North Korea, which is nothing more than a family-run criminal enterprise, far more barbaric and brutal than anything perpetrated by Saddam, Hitler, Pol Pot, or Stalin.  There is no longer any shred of doubt as to what goes on there.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I will think about the characters in this book for a long time.  This is by far the best story I have read by this author.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very good Nicholas Sparks book.  Enjoyed reading it.  I recommend the book to everyone that enjoys Nicholas Sparks books.
B008JFUPFI|4.0|Man of Steel is to Superman as Batman Begins is to Batman; It brings back a popular comics character to the big screen in a fresh way. While Man of Steel is not quite as triumphant a success as Batman Begins was, it is the best Superman film since the 1978 masterpiece. It has a bit in common with Batman Begins, like the realistic approach, but the alien world aspect makes this film feel more like a sci-fi/fantasy adventure than a conventional comic book movie.<br /><br />Man of Steel`s narrative structure is similar to Batman Begins. This is not surprising considering it has the same screenwriter David S. Goyer and the Batman trilogy's director Christopher Nolan acts as a producer.<br /><br />The first fifteen minutes or so are the most entertaining part of the film. The movie treads in full sci-fi fantasy territory, on the dying world of Krypton, where, as is familiar to any Superman fan, Jor-El (Russell Crowe) places his infant son Kal-El into a tiny spacecraft and sends him across the stars to our planet. Meanwhile, Krypton's military leader General Zod (Michael Shannon) attempts a coup, but is caught and tossed with his followers into The Phantom Zone. The dying planet is visually impressive and the previously mostly unexplored territory makes things feel fresher and less generic.<br /><br />After the epic Krypton sequence, the film starts with Clark as an adult and then periodically uses a series of flashbacks sketching out his past. The first half or so deals mainly with Clark's background: his birth, his childhood with the Kents, his feats of strength, he and Lois crossing paths, Clark finding his father's hologram and learning the full potential of his powers.<br /><br />Things get far darker than any Superman film ever has been about half way through this movie when Zod shows up with his minions on Earth. This is where the movie turns into a colossal action extravaganza, serving up both epic spectacle and lots of bombastic superhero action, which is something Superman fans have been starved for on the screen.<br /><br />Needless to say, Superman defeats Zod but at the great cost of probably a billion dollars in property destruction and a great loss of life, which may seem a bit too un-Superman-ish. Is this the right tone befitting the character of Superman? Maybe. Maybe not. There may be something a little iffy about a movie centering around one of the most unfailingly noble, pure-hearted superheroes reveling so much in Transformers-level carnage. The Man of Steel of the golden age comics was brutish and took no prisoners, so for this Superman fan, it works. The ending sequence gives us Clark Kent, mild mannered reporter<br /><br />The visual effects are first-rate, and the action scenes, which are frequent and lengthy, have a quick pace. Sharp-eyed viewers will appreciate some Easter eggs as well (most prominently the LexCorps logo). Goyer also dispenses with at least one hackneyed plot point from most previous films by having Lois discover early on that Clark Kent and Superman are one and the same (though the ending suggests the glasses that magically render him unrecognizable might still have their effect on everyone else).<br /><br />All in all, Man of Steel is far from a perfect motion picture, but it's highly-enjoyable summer blockbuster entertainment, serving up epic spectacle that should entertain most moviegoers, albeit at the cost of sacrificing some heart along the way. Faults aside, I never found the movie boring, but it is not as pure as the 1978 film.ng Superman fans have been starved for on the screen.<br /><br />Needless to say, Superman defeats Zod but at the great cost of probably a billion dollars in property destruction and a great loss of life, which may seem a bit too un-Superman-ish.

Faults aside, I never found the movie boring, but it is not as pure as the 1978 film.cularly Begins (over which he had the most direct input), with its share of clunky dialogue, Man of Steel has a higher quotient of clumsily on-the-nose lines, probably because the Batman trilogy had the Nolan brothers fleshing out the screenplays based off of Goyer’s outline, while here he is the sole screenwriting credit, with no one to soften his rough edges a little.  Sharp-eyed viewers will appreciate some easter eggs (most prominently the LexCorps logo, which could hint at our next villain).

0061537969|5.0|Wow...I just finished this book. I've certainly read books whose authors perhaps had greater technical skill, but I've rarely read one as moving or with such a beautiful message so entertainingly conveyed. To the reviewer who is a non-racing fan...it didn't matter. The book is not about racing; the passages about racing are not about racing. They are nicely crafted parables--simple truths, quietly spoken. I didn't discover this book on my own. I had never heard of Garth Stein. A friend mentioned that he was reading a book written from the perspective of a dog, which is all I needed to know. I was up for something different. I ordered it immediately, and I am so very happy that I did. I highly recommend this insightful, touching story. We can all benefit from a dose of Enzo's wisdom. I'm going now to investigate Mr. Stein's other works. Thank you, Mr. Stein, for sharing your perspective. It has not fallen on deaf ears.
B005PK56TA|4.0|This series lends a macabre look at recent advances in scaring viewers. The story is line well worn starting with a cross country move, a family in distress and a teen who has given up on this world.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This has been a great series of books. Always exciting; always a number of integrating plots; always a surprize at the end. Looking forward to her recent release.
B00008PX8P|5.0|These videos are incredible! They pulled everything out of the archives and here it is. you feel like you're onstage with the band. You can see Jimmy Page's fingers move across the fretboard, you are right next to the bulge in Robert Plant's pants! It's all there in full sound and vision, wow wow wow wow!!! Lots of early stuff, and then also some later stuff like &#34;Kashmir&#34;. Watch it in conjunction with The Song Remains The Same.<br /><br />Unfortunately, a few years after I bought it one of the two discs corroded and has become unwatchable. Why did something like this happen, I don't get it?
B007THA4FI|1.0|What a disaster. I hope the millions of kids for whom she made literature real and exciting, don't buy this book hoping for more of the same. It was disapointing and depressing, sometime disgusting. The characters were poorly developed in a sort of on going way, very difficult to deep track of who was who, what nickname was in effect now. The plot was similarly ongoing and unpredictable. Who was doing what to whom or why. I kept asking mywelf why I was wasting my time reading it, but continued to see what point whe was trying to explain or explore. I never found out!
0399255370|5.0|I have told more friends who are also grandmothers that they MUST buy this book for their kindergarten +/- age grandchildren.  I laughed when I first read it to the kids!
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Great music great band five stars says it all. I cant wait for part 2. One of the best bands of this generation
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|My heading says it all - Charlie from Always Sunny Philadelphia adds some needed humor (he does great).  The rest of the acting is decent with a lot of the one liners being super cheesy.  The special effects are worth watching it at least once and my guess is that they redeemed the movie with higher than expected reveiws on other sites (i.e. rotten tomatoes, etc.)
B00DOPEGAS|4.0|My daughter purchased the cra-z-loom with some birthday money. All the kids at school are doing this trendy craft, and she wanted to keep up. The loom works as described, but only after a few trials and errors with the process. Once the learning curve has been overcome, the product is easy to use and produces really pretty, unique bracelets and other items that kids can trade with friends. They are even going to sell their handmade bracelets to raise money for their 5th grade school trip this year. I would recommend purchasing extra bands right away because local stores run out before their supplies even hit the shelves--that's how popular this product is with the 5th graders. Also, you can get more for the money on Amazon.com than you can in the craft store. If your child is patient and smart, she will really enjoy working this fun craft.
B000RLFJQ2|5.0|Surprise ending---------- sort of historically accurate about double agents and the life of intrigue they give their lives to ......nuff said!

B00DBISUWS|4.0|You'll definitely only find a biased review here.  I'm a sucker for Goldfrapp, and I mean real Goldfrapp, not the dance remixes that hit the air waves.  I love it and could listen to this for hours on repeat.  It has the same ethereal quality as previous albums just not as much depth of variety......but like I said it makes me melt.
B004UPANAI|5.0|I don't understand why so many critics panned this Wolverine movie and praised the second one, \\"The Wolverine.\\" I've watched \\"Origins\\" five times and just love its combination of Logan's family history, the myriad mutants he encounters, his love interest, the tie-ins with the other X-Men movies, and so on. Rollicking fun!  In contrast, \\"The Wolverine\\" has an insipid plot where characters completely change their motivations in not-believable ways, and which feels like it had a dozen writers who'd barely met. <snore>
B001YV506S|5.0|A true classic...My family and I love this movie and will love it for years to come! Very Clear picture!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|So the ending was very unexpected. Unfortunately, book 3 felt unrefined and rushed. It lacked the depth books 1 and 2 had.  The end was too neat and clean, in terms of how the faction, government, and political issues were resolved. Too bad
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This is a really great family movie...my family and i can watch it over and over again every movie night.
0316017930|5.0|I am reading this book again because I want to be sure to get all I can from it. Malcolm Gladwell has such a different perspective that one can't help but feel like you've been taught by a very wise instructor. I love all his books.

We both loved the first book (Divergent) and since my daughter is away a college she hasn't caught up to reading the 2nd and 3rd books yet. I finished Allegient recently and my first impulse was to warn my daughter against reading this book. My daughter like alot of teenage girls want to experience a wonderful first love where things are hopeful, perhaps it's unrealistic but they're young. Girls who haven't had their first true love, often experience it emotionally through YA books like Twilight, Immortal Instruments, and Hunger Games. Allegient just makes the reader want to throw the book at the wall. Either Ms. Roth wanted to disassociate her series from Hunger Games, which it is obvious she was inspired by when writing Divergent, or she just doesn't undersand her audience very well. I'm not alone in my opinion, I have a co-worker who also reads alot of YA fiction and she hated the ending as well. Other than the ending, there were situations in the book that weren't fully developed such as the genesis of the idea of damaged versus pure genes, and some of the characters. This one was a disappointment.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A very interesting and compelling book.  Can't wait until the third book of the trilogy is published. I hope it's as good as book 2
0199270295|5.0|I used the previous edition of this textbook, and it is one of the best textbooks I have read. The order is logical and the language is clear and lively. Focus was placed on understanding and visualizing.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|i went to watch it on the big screen when it was just on. i feel very satisfied at that time<br />but this time,just so so.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|ITS FUN TO PLAY AND CHALLENGING.  TAKES A LOT OF TIME TO DO SOME OF THE ONES BUT ALWAYS FUN<br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THE GAME TO ANYONE WHO LIKES A CHALLENGE AND HAS A LOT OF PATIENCE.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so glad to see Candy Crush finally on Kindle. I had to play on my phone or on Facebook. Now I can play on my Kindle. Thank you so much for getting this.
B003BV8I3Q|5.0|This is a true story of grit and determination to become something better then you were but also getting in touch with your community and trying to show them that there is a different path to travel in this thing called life.
0425263924|2.0|do not waste your money on this series, stay with 50 Shades. This is a crude version piggy backing on the prior series popularity.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm loving this game.....takes my mind off other things... the kids can enjoy as well .... soooo addictive..CANDY CRUSH ROCKS!!!!!!!
1593080204|5.0|Got this for my daughter who had never read it. I have found that purchasing from Amazon is far cheaper than that of the retailer. There is even a section for &#34;new & used&#34; I have purchased many books(university,too) from the &#34;used&#34; section many times and have never been disappointed. The prices are always good, and sometimes if I have to pay shipping, it is more than reasonable.
0307592731|4.0|This is an entirely readable, fast paced book.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a good adventure tale as well as anyone interested in back packing really arduous trails.
1575666286|5.0|We purchased this after seeing a few documentaries on this Doctor.  So of course I got online and Amazon had this book for a great price and good delivery. We started to try several of the techniques with good results. For us it is a positive life changing book.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|King's usual good writing, but without the sheer terror of The Shining.<br />It was a good read, and it's a good addition to the compendium.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is awesome it is great my brother can even play it he always ask me if he can play my kindle just so he can play this game I am a girl who loves this game and I will always love it whoever made this has to make more games like this if you gave it one star you are crazy  their is nothing wrong with this game so you guys are awesome who loves this game and you are awesome if you give it give it five stars you should totally get this game if you don't have it already it is also good for all ages please get this game it will get very addicting but I'm happy that it is very addicting so that is why I have to say thnx and have a great day
B00ANAC32U|5.0|Protects the phone and allows easy use of all the buttons and ports. I had a different, cheaper case before that made it almost impossible to press the buttons on the side. Recommend this in conjunction with dbrand vinyl case. Looks awesome that way.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|The Stargate franchise is excellant entertainment in the sy-fi genre. I wish shows like this could go on forever and ever.
B005ZMUTZ4|5.0|I got this for my son and barely listened while he was watching it, and yet still managed to cry at the end too.  Disney / Pixar knocked it out of the park again.
0765325950|5.0|I hate to see this story end. It has been a joyful ride along with Rand,Matt,Perrin, and all the other characters in this series.
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|I'll start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Star Trek Into Darkness. The movie has great effects, some very nice acting moments courtesy of Benedict Cumberbatch, and some suspenseful moments and elaborated action sequences. That being said, you probably shouldn't think too much about the movie's plot while you watch. Just sit back and enjoy the show. Afterwards, you can analyze it and pick the film to pieces (it's quite easy, actually).
B005PK1G76|5.0|Don't buy the stroller brand organizer- that one is 4 times the price of this one- and this works perfectly with the baby jogger. very functional. You can't put too much in it or when the child gets out of the stroller it will tip, but good for small items like water and keys
B00F7YHDWC|1.0|Holy cow talk about video ads galore! After every game you play there is an unskippable 15 sec ad that you can't skip. Total crap. Uninstalled
B00005YU98|5.0|Had this album in college, liked it then, still like it now. Red Army Blues is one of the great songs.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I recently started watching on my Kindle, computer and iPad.  I think I'm addicted.  Can't wait to see what happens.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|This album is absolutely amazing! I would really recommend buying, it's seriously worth it!!  While both CD are great New is much different from Kisses on The Bottom!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book was very enjoyable, but the ending left you hanging.  Ready for the next book to continue the story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Highly addictive and challenging at times. Be warned candy crush will Help you pass the time. Reminds me of the days of Pac-Man.
0307720748|5.0|I knew very little about Richard before I started reading and now I can hardly put the book down.  No wonder he is as successful in business as he is!  Highly recommended.
B00FWLSLJ4|4.0|it's Godzilla of are time!! fun to watch and not over done. The story line is pure fantasy but that was the writing back bone of the Godzilla stories , so take it for what it is .
B005PTQPU0|5.0|Kate has surpassed herself with another quality CD of timeless and haunting music and words.  She never gets boring and I hope we hear more from her soon!
1401902197|5.0|Given to many people to help them focus on what they want instead of what they don't want in their life.  Another book to read each day.

0812993357|5.0|Working in the same industry, I find Grace Coddington's story very inspiring. Glad to know that such a hardworking, inspiring and lovely person like her still exists! She's one of a kind.
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|Agnetha has surpassed herself with this CD.  Even though she says this is the last she'll record I hope she will grace us with another one in the future as she has a voice that could charm the angels!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|the entire series was very good and i loved the ending<br />if you haven't read it you need to!<br />I was very pleased in that it is difficult to tell that the authors changed for the last few books!
B004SBS8LA|4.0|the kids played and took turns well 2 tries or two levels each then they switched players no problem wonderful! Three kids!
B0086700CM|5.0|Work great on my Kindle Fire.I play this all the time. Does this game every end though. Wow can you beat it?
B00DI75SWM|1.0|Do not waist your time downloading!!! If I could rate it a -1 I would as one star is to much.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a very good read. I'm not sure how Tess really fit in with the plot, bu I enjoyed her story nonetheless. Worthwhile and enjoyable!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|now I can play candy crush on my kindle fire without having to wait for my computer to start up to even be able to play
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|The Shining is one of my favorites of Stephen King's novels so I couldn't pass up reading about what happens to Danny years later.  I wasn't disappointed. Don't expect a repeat of The Shining. Doctor Sleep is it's own story.
0521173787|5.0|I buy it for my neic and she is very happy because its help her with the exam to much
B00FPH6A70|5.0|For me, one of the scariest movies that I have seen in awhile. Right up there with &#34;The Exorcist!&#34; Will be watching it again soon.
1449305172|5.0|This book condenses the theory and experience of Ash of his lean projects.<br />While the book is more of Eric Ries on Lean Philosophy, Lean Running with his hands-on approach is a step by step guide 'to move from Plan A to a plan that works' not only for startups, but also for established companies who want to innovators in developing sustainable business. Recommended for all entrepreneurs as a guide to be applied daily to achieve successful business.
B003U4ZOQ8|5.0|My family likes to watch TV, but not too much TV.  so rather than waste time on our own individual favorite shows, we like to watch together as a family.  We need a show that will entertain us and keep us on the edge of our seats with anticipation.  Nothing beats &#34;Lost&#34;.  From my 12 year old, to my 15 year old, and right up to us parents, this show challenges us all intellectually and is a whole bunch of fun at the same time.  Do your family a favor an start a LOST ritual.  (We can't wait to begin seasons 5 and 6!)  By the way, since this series was made several years ago, we don't need to wait for future seasons; we can keep going - at least until bedtime.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|Gladwell has an amazing ability to look at the world with different lenses than the rest of us, backs up his suppositions with data, and then explain it in a simple and engaging manner.  I always find myself feeling a little smarter after reading his books.
1451666179|5.0|Allie's illustrations have got to be the funniest thing I have ever seen, and her writing will have you rolling on the floor. If you don't like this book you probably don't have a soul.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is one of my favorite book series, so I got very attached to it. Going into Allegiant, I knew people were upset with the ending so I expected the worst, and because of that, I ended up very happy. The book concluded the series very well, so I assume others started reading it assuming the book would end all sunshine and butterflies. If you only like happy, perfect wrap-ups, then this dystopian series is not for you.
B00BMR5HOO|2.0|I wanted a live weather widget.  It does'nt offer that.  It does give good detail though if that's what your looking for
B0007LGCB8|5.0|This is the second pair of Newports I have owned. I wore the first pair out over several years. They are built to last and fit like a glove!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging and fun to play.  The rooms are interesting and some hiding places are tough to find. Not too many ads either.
B00BAXFAOW|5.0|This was very motivational.  I think I knew all of these concepts before but it is great to see the &#34;science&#34; behind it!  Highly recommended!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I bought this to amplify my music coming from my iPod. It does a great job, especially considering how small it is. In fact, I was surprised at how small it really is. I have attached it with Velcro to the back of my iPod, and it stays hidden while doing its thing. Great little device.
B00COH0W00|5.0|I do not know how I missed this movie when it came up.  I loved it!  I have not been disappointed with a John Cusack movie and this one was no exception!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book is truly amazing.... The author gives you great insight into the lacks live and their everyday struggle of dealing with the injustice of their mother cells. It also provides you a flashback of early medicine and some of the unethical practices on African Americans. A must read for all science students.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is so well written that the characters seem tangible.  The author's knowledge of the lands and culture were key to making these stories come alive.  We selected it for our book club and everyone enjoyed it.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|Great period piece. Kids didn't watch it all the way through. Most of the action is in the second half.
B00002N9ER|1.0|Less than a year of ownership and one has broken. The light has been removed/replaced in these holder maybe a dozen times.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show always amazes me with beautiful details and a twisting storyline that is truly unique compared to all other television shows that are currently airing.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|This is a feel good family classic that will have you on the edge of your seat and smiling and laughing.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|The movement of characters through different times and scenes requires careful attention. It's an interesting and unique premise, and well worth watching simply to see the end where they show you the parts played by different actors. Some of the diverse roles played by well known actors will surprise you.
B007T8BYWE|3.0|Excellent game in every way except too short. Needs more puzzles. I completed the entire app in almost one sitting.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|***Spoilers***<br /><br />Aside from the inconsistencies and the difficulty in distinguishing point of view throughout the chapters, (because I can look beyond that when I’m enjoying an overall story/characters)  Tris’ death was NOT okay with me.  I understand that I am not the author and VR can do whatever she wants with these characters, but I also read books to enjoy ‘made-up stories’….not to be trapped in the reality of death and unhappy endings that we see on the news every day.  Taking her away (even if she wanted it to play out like self-sacrifice) killed the whole story for me. The impending movie is much less appealing to me now that I know how the story ends.  I wish that I could have stopped after Insurgent and made up my own ending….
B007EC27QM|4.0|Does everything a calculator is supposed to do. I especially appreciate the scrolling feature. Very helpful. Excellent app. Can be used for so many requirements.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Stuck on levels to long , if you dont pay fir extras,your screwed. Very frustrating, but i do like the app.
B000Z8GZYW|3.0|I purchased this video to be able to re-run the movie at my leisure.  Second and third screenings did not increase my appreciation.  Some of the humor did not wear well, and the repetition, key to setting up the happy ending, got monotonous.  That said, Bill Murray and the cast did a very good job with the material.
B009LDD54K|5.0|So far have complete collection.  Have not as yet watched any of the sets.  Now into season 4.  Disappointed with some of the favorites disappearing.
0316322407|5.0|This courageous and intelligent young girl has the tenacity to stand up for her beliefs despite threats made real through an attempted assassination. The book is simply written yet offers a very clear history of Pakistan, and particularly the Swat Valley, throughout the encroachment of the Taliban on the lives of ordinary people living out their Muslim faith. Though politics, religion and faith are strong themes, there seems to be restraint exerted towards keeping the read as apolitical as possible. Without hesitation, I handed my copy to my 12 year-old to read when I was finished and recommended the book to her school for next years &#34;One School, One Book&#34;.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  Brought tears when he finally reconnected with his parents after all he went thru to survive.  These are my favorite type of movie to watch.
1449410243|5.0|I gave this as a holiday gift to several friends who love their cats, as we do ours. The insider's humor is incredibly funny. This is the sort of thing that plays off your cat's normal behavior and your healthy paranoia that &#34;Kitty&#34; may have a different agenda. Great book!
B00A0SQBDM|3.0|Love the game . . .but when I purchased a few days ago it listed the game as FULL version @ 80% off the list price of $4.99. I thought how cool is that? A G5 full version HO game - and its only .99&cent;. Well I paid the .99&cent; and guess what? It's Not the FULL version. How am I saving 80% off the FULL version when I didn't get the full version? Am I CONFUSED about something or missing some info here?
0689878451|5.0|This is a true story of two male penguins in the Central Park Zoo who partnered for life. When their cohort nested and produced eggs, they chose an egg shaped stone and took turns sitting on it. A caring zoo keeper provided them a fertile but discarded egg which they tended until hatching. Their baby,Tango, completed their family. This is a lovely gift for any child in a blended family.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|works freak glad its finally on kindle. cant stop playing!! wish you could have your gold on here like you do on db though.
B009PNQUXO|2.0|Its not like the regular YouTube. I could not access my account and my favorites. I could only watch the suggested videos and adding one was a bust.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book, and the ending especially, really slaps Veronica Roth's readers in the face.  I mean, I feel like she set out to get revenge on all of her loyal readers, who were so looking forward to this book!  The way Tris dies does not do her justice, either.  And, unless you're Shakespeare, killing off the main characters in your story is never a good idea.<br />Besides the ending, this book has so many thoughts that just trailed off in the story.  Like why is Tris so special?  Why can she resist every serum, when others can't?  It seemed like there should have been more of an explanation then, \\"oh, look, Tris really is Divergent.  Moving on...\\"  In a story so focused on DNA and genes and stuff, even if Tris' abilities were not in her genes, there should have been a more solid explanation.<br />There was also the whole scene with David and Nita, when she gives him the terror serum.  After they ask for the passcode, David says \\"Her!...The-the name-\\" and then points at Tris.  Now, I thought that he just told them the passcode.  I honestly thought that it was going to be \\"Natalie,\\" because he loved Tris' mom, and in his terror thought that Tris was Natalie.<br />Finally, as other reviewers have pointed out, too many characters change for the better too dramatically.  Roth makes everything unbelievably rainbows and butterflies at the end, which simply makes no sense.<br />Even without the ending, this book just left far too many questions unanswered.  In the final book of a series, I feel like every word and scene selected carefully because they are the last you will give to your readers.  Veronica Roth did not do this, and left sloppy questions that took away from the entire series.<br />It's a pity, because on the whole I think Roth is a talented writer.  I just think she made poor decisions with this book.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Really Good !! I like this game, my son is 5 years old , both play all time really goid
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps your interest.  Very good book.  Surprise ending.  Recommend this book.  What more can I say?  I'd read another from this author.
B00FEHXISA|5.0|A lot of action and story line, the new suits were amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B00G32TD98|5.0|We wanted to see this movie in the theatre but couldn't get there and when it came out on DVD we couldn't wait.  We rented it last Saturday night and absolutely loved it.  It was the best scary movie I have seen in a very long time and I am a scary movie fanatic, the original Halloween being my all time favorite.  If you are looking for a creepy, skin crawler movie, this is it!!!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Best book I've read this year.  Heartwarming.  Love cats.  Would love to see BOB one day.  Wish he would go on tour.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|I just discovered Joe Bonamassa when I saw his concert from the Vienna Opera House on TV the other night. WOW!!!
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|I got tired of waiting for it to be on Netflix, so I just bought. Worth every penny. Watched it twice already!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|Logic . Knowing how one move can go far. Having no timers  gives us a chance to figure out the next move
B003MXB4FC|5.0|We rented this movie to watch with our teenage girls. They enjoyed it very much, and we did too. It was family friendly which is a big plus. It was just a fun movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. Minions are the best. I love the new Halloween themes too. I only wish that you could buy more with bananas. I don't want to spend really money on anything.
B00CJKW4WQ|1.0|This keypad doesn't work for me.  Every time I go to use it  I have to reset it and reconnect it to my Mac. So I end up not using it.  I finally broke down and bought  the Apple USB keyboard with the 10 keys to attach to my iMac.
B0073Q0IY2|4.0|I loved the original low-budget version and this was just as good. Would definitely watch again. The &#34;Thing&#34; creature was truly gross (in a good way for us horror fans :D ).
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lots of fun. Wish there were more lives but worth the challenge. Very addictive and hard to stop playing  fun fun
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is easy to play and quick to get interested in.  You'll find yourselves counting down the seconds until you can get new lives to beat tough levels.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think it is a great game I like it better than the original game but the monkey thing that chases you is a little weird
B000HF0KXU|3.0|I've never been a fan of John Travolta; I was into this movie for one person, Hugh Jackman. Even though this wasn't his best work, he was still yummy to watch. Entertainment factor; so-so.
B006QKJQM6|5.0|My kids (and I) love this movie.  Lots of action and comedy to keep us all interested.  I would highly recommend it!
B004ADH1RI|4.0|Not your average treasure hunt with a bunch of baby brat-packers chasing One-eyed Willie's hidden treasure with Fretelli's hot on their trail. This is a favorite of mine ( what can I say, I'm a kid at heart. :)
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I have fell in love with this game and a few others like it. Great for stimulating your brain. It make you think and keep you on your toes. Love it!!!
B002ITWSUQ|4.0|I always thought this movie was worthwhile to watch; it was funny and entertaining in a quirky way. A nice modern twist on a fairy tale.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I downloaded this game because I like these kinds of games, but this one is by far the hardest, and agonizing of all of these games, I'm very disappointed in this game to no end. To me it deserves no stars, and deserves to be deleted it is a waste of a game.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Loved the story and the author's style. Enjoyed the way the past and present were linked together. Was glad storyline was a little unpredictable. Would definitely recommend to most female readers over the age of 18
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is awesome and so much fun.  You build its a awesome game  but it once was a pain I click a button and boom fixed  a awesome game save your money on the game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I could not believe that Amazon brought candy crush to the kindle. I was so happy. Now I am on level 25  I can't get enough of this game. Thanks Amazon
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally available for the Kindle Fire!  This is the real game and will sync to your FB so you aren't starting over.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it was a story but based on a true event that I knew nothing about.  I loved the connection of a troubled young girl and a very old woman.  We have so much to learn from the experiences of those who have gone before us.  Very heart warming even with the struggles of these 2 girls.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is a classic sci-fi movie that will leaving you wondering if there really is life out there in the stars.
B009JZSC9S|4.0|The writing in this series is superb, as is the acting. One of the things that keeps things fresh is that it's not your typical court-room drama or procedural. You get to see investigations, jury deliberations, judges play significant roles, jail, the political machine, etc. The recurring roles are almost uniformly fantastic, both in terms of writing and acting. In fact, there are times when the secondary characters far outshine the main cast in terms of character and storyline.<br /><br />This is the first season where I feel like the writing is starting to slip a bit. They tend to reach for similar plot devices and I wasn't super-thrilled with the direction of several of the characters, particularly Alicia. There was a palpable sense that the studio was mulling over dropping a bunch of characters (maybe due to contracts? I dunno). There was a second plausible exit line for Kalinda (first was the hubby, second was the new investigator), Cary, having just returned, is plotting to leave, Eli was out, then in again. At a certain point, these soft exits seemed contrived and obtrusive.<br /><br />It is hard to tell if this uneven season was purposeful or necessary to settle contracts and/or create tension and uncertainty that will be resolved or escalated in coming seasons. My hope is that this is the cause, as opposed to a writing/directing team that is losing interest or running out of ideas (a thing that happens to many series, including every JJ Abrams project ever).
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Good thriller, keeps you spooked throughout most of it. I will keep you guessing too. Ethan Hawke did well in this movie.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I look forward to every episode. I love the mind boggling journey. Walter is fascinating and funny. Peter makes it a family.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|I normally don't like Disney/Pixar cute movies like this, but this one was fun and enjoyable throughout. It was a lovely bunch of coconuts.
0804137501|2.0|I run an established small but growing remote business. Given how helpful Getting Real and Rework were for small, growing businesses, I assumed Remote would be full of great actionable strategies for being an effective remote team.<br /><br />While there were 1 or 2 minor tidbits of useful information, the vast majority of the book is aimed at why non-remote companies should become remote, and how employees can convince their bosses to become remote.<br /><br />There is very little useful information for someone who is already convinced a remote company is the way to go, and is looking for strategies for managing a remote company effectively.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|my grandsons are into lego's and play soccer so this was a perfect birthday gift ..and my 5 year old was extremely happy with it ...
B00FPGSPQU|3.0|The movie started too slow... and almost turned it off... but it improved towards the end, and of course, the final after-the-credits scene made me ROFL...
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|The first half is the soundtrack to the party you want to have, second half is when only the cool people are left to chill
B002SSUQFG|3.0|This was my first mechanical watch purchase.  I was very pleased with its look, feel and accuracy.  I wore the watch daily for 8 - 9 months before I noticed that the winding mechanism was loose.  The watch will not \\"recharge\\" the spring any longer.  I suspect this has something to do with the low water depth rating or mine might just be an outlier since other reviews have shown longer periods without problems.  But overall it's a good watch.  I will recommend it others to others because you cant beat the price.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I'll admit: I watched the show first. And often, if I watch the show/movie first, I'm disappointed in the book. Not so with this book, as the writer is truly a good writer, and it's not just her story that engages (while it is engaging) but her writing as well. She doesn't just rehash her tale, she's introspective and intelligent and it shows in her storytelling.
B00AZ7V0W0|4.0|For those that purchased the blue-ray of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, you can discard or sell it , the EXACT same disc is included inside this collection (it also contains ALL of the contents from the InfiniFilm DVD version). If you purchased the double feature blue-ray of Elm Street Parts 2 & 3, discard or sell it, exact same disc, pressing and contents are inside this box. Elm Street parts 4-7 are all here with the same contents as the DVDs only now they are blue-ray.  It is nice that there is a set with a fairly decent price tag (shame the Halloween franchise couldn't be offered up the same). For those that are die-hard collectors, the Dokken video is included inside this set. The 3-D sequence in Elms Street Part 6 is NOT in this set (go find that Elm Street Encyclopedia disc that came out with the old DVD box set, that had the 3-D sequence). I just wanted those like me that want to know the differences and what is included and dropped to be aware of what is inside, it helps when we purchase and sell off older discs when replacing them with blue.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Book has been out a while, but it is still a good read with relevant information for those looking to find meaning in their work and be great at doing it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I can't wait for the next program to see what is happening within the house with the suspense of the family and the servants and their families.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This show is brilliant. period. One of the best episodes in a long time, reminiscent of Season 1...my favorite season.
B00AB65SVE|5.0|I have watched every episode of every season and wanted to add this to my collection (I have the first three seasons.) It will give me something to lift chuckle about when I need it.
B00FAXLCWW|5.0|It takes a certain kind of person to enjoy Haim, but the ones who do should absolutely love them! Their talent and energy levels are through the roof, and together they make intense, unique music. Please see them live if you have a chance! They are one of the best bands I've ever seen live.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book with multiple story lines throughout the chapters. Choices made in life and those not made are key themes
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I hate that there's no more Tris.<br /><br />It k sucks real bad. I wanted Tobias to react more than he did.
B005PK56TA|5.0|GREAT! It is better than season 3 more story line. Real interesting I enjoyed the way each story was intertwined with each other. The way the stories explained each others story line very well done.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Excellent acting, great story lines and an excellent show for mature audiences.So far all the past season have been very enjoyable.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|This is a very well written story that makes you want to keep reading to find out what will happen. Each chapter starts with a quote from an unknown character. For example, \\" If men read these words, let them know that power is a heavy burden. Seek not to be bound by its chains. The Terries prophecies say that I will have the power to save the world. They hint, however, that I will have the power to destroy it as well.\\"  As the story progresses, you start to realize who is saying these words. The mystery tantalizes the reader and half way through, the reader stops and wonders, who is this person. The final chapter reveals all, with a twist. This is very skillfully developed and it does draw the reader into the story.<br /><br />In this fantasy/science fiction story there is a world where the majority of the people, the Skaa, are enslaved and thought to be even less than human. It's a story about survival and hope and attempts to free themselves, and brutal suppression of any sign of rebellion. The Lord Ruler is God. No one can resist him or destroy this creature that is immortal. Who is he, really, and can he ever be stopped from his evil killing of the Skaa? Any disobedience or resistance results in public executions, where hundreds of random villagers are rounded up.<br /><br />Excerpt: \\"Four axes fell and four heads were sheared free. The bodies, still held by soldiers, were allowed to spurt their last lifeblood into the fountain basins. . . .Spook looked away sickly. Kelsier, however, Kelsier was angry. . . . Four more deaths, one of them a child. . . . This is our enemy. . . . Four more deaths. . . . Look at them!\\" Kelsier demanded, pointing at the bleachers full of nobility. . . . Four more deaths.\\" And so it has been for thousands of years.<br /><br />The many characters are introduced at a controlled pace and you soon begin to know them. It's great character development, and there are multiple main characters. This is difficult for many authors to do, but Sanderson does a great job with his characters. Kelsier appears as one of the Skaa who has somehow broken free from the enslavement. He travels from plantation to plantation trying to encourage people to join him in resisting, and the fantasy part of the story appears as you soon realize he has what can only be called super powers. Kelsier is a likeable character, flaws and all. The 16-year old girl Vin joins him as a main character, and we see her manifesting super powers she did not even realize she had. Is she perhaps stronger than Kelsier?<br /><br />I like the writing style that builds and builds in intensity and ends with a hint of what's to come at the end of each chapter. It's paced, builds on the mystery and reveals the answer at the appropriate time. The reader wants to keep reading to find out what is going to happen next. The style is very similar to author Kat Jaske who writes historical fiction and science fiction and who develops stories and multiple characters so expertly that the reader feels that she actually knows the people.<br /><br />Mistborn is a great story, really deserving of a 5-star rating, that will grab you at the beginning and keep you reading until the twists and turns reveal the final outcome.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0741440415 Righting Time: Book Three of By Honor Bound]]<br />[[ASIN:0741450607 Out of Phase: A Time Traveler's Chronicle (By Honor Bound)]]nderson does a great job with his characters.

B00BB8OHMW|5.0|The HD Quality was Excellent. A very clear picture and good sound. This is also an excellent movie and one of my favorites.
B00498XRPE|4.0|Genre defining movie.  Do yourself a favor and see it.  It's amazing what they were able to do without CGI.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Enjoyed it. Watched at hospital while waiting for my father to get out of surgery. Time passed quickly. Was fun to see all the &#34;super hero's&#34; in one movie. Most cg was good. Some for adult missed mark. But I think the younger group will really enjoy
B002RVCD6O|4.0|For the most part, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince is a great movie, particularly when the story focuses on key elements such as Ron's confidence in Quidditch, Hermione and Harry's love ache, and especially Dumbledore and Harry's journey to the cave on the coast.  However, the most important parts of this book was the background information on Tom Riddle, which is unfortunately barely touched on; there's more reasons to fear He-Who-Should-Not-Be-Named than just a missing nose, and the movie failed to deliver.<br />From my own personal prejudice: I love the storyline between Harry and Ginny, and the movie goes entirely off-script.  In the movie, their first kiss is alone and in private; in the book, it's in public with everyone watching.  Long live the bold and gorgeous Ginny Weasley.
0345529057|5.0|Great series of course. I fell in love with series watching it on HBO. I am very disappointed in myself for not reading the series before it was aired. I am making up for that now.
B00EPFEY44|5.0|This album has replaced my other music on my drive to work each day.  What a way to eliminate road rage.....listen to this amazing album
B005KR6OBM|3.0|Arrived as a Christmas gift. Some of the DVD's pause and skip when playing (in different players too)....they play as if they are &#34;Pirate&#34; DVD's.....  I wrote to the vendor and NEVER received a reply from them. Obviously a very very poor quality check by this vendor. I would rate it much lower but the DVD's are the program and I cannot complain about the program itself! Beware of poor quality coming from this vendor and poor customer service.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|After reading all the reviews about pens for ipad I decided on this cosmonaut. I am satisfied even though I am realizing I am not using it as much just because ipad isn't meant for a pen. There are few apps where I actually like it, like drawing or taking on the fly notes. The pen response is quick, great and precise, good quality for drawing and I was used to draw in college so I was really impressed about the precision of lines and all of that. Maybe it feels a little fat which gives a wide grip but it takes some time to adjust. Once you get that feeling it will be ok to use it on everyday basis as I did for few months. Some pens require you to push a little but not this one and I guess they made it fat and a little heavy just for that reason so you don't spend extra energy pushing the tip on the screen. The pen is durable and feels if good quality material. I had it in my backpack with no case for months and it  still works as well. Overall I am satisfied about the quality reason why I give 5 stars but still feel a pen is an extra unnecessary tool for an ipad.
B000KGGIQY|5.0|This was a very very very cheap price on this movie. Thought it would be poor quality but it was NOT. Fast and friendly service.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Was very excited when it was introduced because it provided a compact stream player for travel. After a couple of months, however, only Netflix is available for streaming. Thought by now that at least Amazon prime would be added.
B003FXCSU4|4.0|This only my second Dick book, a great read, if you like sci fi you won be disappointed. Left me wanting more as I couldn't put it down...
B004EFYZ1C|4.0|Moon Phase Pro works well on my Kinde HD. It's a quick and handy tool I plan to use while teaching my college astronomy class.
B00881VLCE|5.0|The puzzle graphics are very nice.  I think that this will be an app that my son will find interesting too.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|IT WAS AMAZING!! Very quick read. I find it relaxing lol. It is also very different from the show. It is more interesting!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Another great book in the series! I wish there were another one in the series to read. I guess I'll have to wait for the movie to come out to get my fix lol
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great game can't stop playing. The graphics are great. Easy to play. Fun for all ages. A great challenge at higher levels.
0553328255|5.0|This is a great gift or set for you own collection. Compact and complete. Perfect for fans with limited shelf space.
0385120508|5.0|I have not only read this book, but I re-read it three times.  Love the story and the characters.  Truly a Book of Substance.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|This set is multiple toys in one. You can't go wrong with Legos. Price is about average for a set of this size.
B003R17BV0|5.0|Great real life story. I'd reccomend it to any sports lover. I believe that people that don't like sports would like this movie too.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I found this book to be a constant page turner. Amazingly Lois Lowry shows us in this book that it is alright to remember, even if the memories are not always pleasant. It is from our memories that life has true meaning.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|I was unable to play any of the games in this app since their opening screen started with pages and pages of advertisements. As a result, I just deleted this app from my Kindle Fire HD. I'm actually sorry I spent the time to download it.
B000GWE44U|5.0|When The Shining was written, I was a very young mother who didn't like scary books.  I loved the 1980's movie, but had not watched it in years.  When Stephen King release his new sequel, &#34;Doctor Sleep,&#34;  I decided to read the original book.  Wow!  I couldn't put it down!  I am so glad that I read this book prior to reading King's new book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Have always loved this game totally awesome and spot on  thunderbear just awesome graphics as usual would highly recommend all fans and new to the franchise play
B00FWLSLJ4|3.0|Story very predictable.  Can guess what conflicts each character will have and what the outcome will be.  Nothing new here.
B008US4PBY|5.0|I use this for xbox360 console to ps3 controller. All I do is:<br />1. Turn on the 360<br />2. Connect the Cronus device to the 360 via usb<br />3. Wait until the Cronus device display shows &#34;A. U.&#34;<br />4. Connect a wired 360 controller to the Cronus device<br />5. Wait until the Cronus device display shows &#34;0&#34;<br />6. Disconnect the 360 controller<br />7. Connect the ps3 controller to the Cronus device via usb<br />8. Enjoy your game
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Amazing but it also tore my heart out and ripped it to shreds.  It has one of the biggest plot twists ever and I almost threw it at my wall.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|The marvel universe is amazing, all of the movies in the \\"Avenger Initiative\\" series are awesome.  The only thing holding them back are the licensing deals made with Fox for X-men & Fantastic Four, and Sony with Spider-man.  So many of the great and important characters cant be put into the Avengers movies that really need to be.  With all of the different production company making money hand over foot in the theaters every summer with and super-hero movies, why cant the figure out any cross licensing deals.  We need Spider-man, Wolverine, Beast and many more in the Avengers...  How great would a X-Men Vs Avengers movie be after the great comic cross over from a a couple years ago.  I just feel that they have so much potential but Fox and Sony just keep going for quick cash grabs while Disney / Marvel studios is going with great long term plans.  Comic book story lines never end, these series have been going for 50+ years.  You shouldn't have compartmentalized movies with definitive endings.  They should play like James Bond, just keep going.  introduce new secondary people build up old ones phase or kill others off...
B001BANK32|5.0|This is classic Stephen King, from the character build-up to the final conflict. If you are a horror/suspense fan, this is not to be missed. One of his best.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|This is the best Batman movie out, yes including all the live action ones!  I love this movie, its the film that perfectly captures the dark world of Gotham.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen Kings writing style as matured since The Shining and all for the better.  Danny Torrence as an adult is the reluctant, anguished hero.  King uses the antagonists from the Overlook Hotel in a subtle way.  It brings back Dick Holleran and gives the reader more of a glimpse into those who have &#34;the shining&#34;.  The new bad guys are terrifying in an almost normal way.  They use the shining to their advantage and feed off of it.  Instead of the Overlook, we get the True Knot.
B005DF2QMC|1.0|I hate it . No matter what I do I can't get it too work. There were no instructions. I am not tec savy.
B0009HLD0K|3.0|I bought this mostly to complete my collection of cycling movies on DVD/BluR. I´ve seen it on screen long ago and it was OK then and it was OK to revisit it.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love the vampire diaries. Great tv show. Give it a chance and you will not be disappointed. BUY THIS SHOW!!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|...and I love them as much as ever. They are cheesy and silly and the bad guys are so bad, and the good guys are so...human. Even the alien good guys.
B00C7607BC|5.0|I love the Little Mermaid. It was may favorite movie as a little kid and when it came out on Blu-ray it was a no brainer.
B00EUGYM04|5.0|If you've ever been remotely interested in this band, or even rock and grunge-y sound for that matter, then this is a must have CD. You can't really go wrong with all the great hits, crispy new songs, and fermented hidden treats of olde.<br /><br />The large variation music mixed with this bands unique taste makes for a great time that I've been coming back for year after year. However, if you're like me and have all of the previous CDs, you may be a little hearth broken when you get teased and left wanting more new material... but those moments when that euphoria hits your veins- it's bliss.<br /><br />So, by the end of it, new comers and die-hards will be thrilled and should buy this right now, but everyone in the middle will just have to judge for themselves if they want the CD or to just nit-pick single downloads from the album.
B0053O89WY|5.0|excellent DVD quality and an absolutely hilarious TV show for both the academics and the non academics. I highly recommend.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Love this game, very interesting and challenging, I raced through this game and enjoyed every moment of it. Highly recommended.
B005H29GSI|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my nephew and he absolutely loved it and plays with it all the time. The pieces can be small so it's not good for small children but Aidan is 8 and it was great for him.
B001N4RORE|4.0|Streamed well.  i had no issues. The movie is just like the original one, very fun, the songs are addictive and stick in your head.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my nephew and he absolutely loved it and plays with it all the time. The pieces can be small so it's not good for small children but Aidan is 8 and it was great for him.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I was disappointed in the second book in the series. Did not care for it. This book seemed to gain momentum as it went on and I started caring about what happened to the characters again. Finished the book in 2 reading sessions.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I bought this series this past summer while on location for work and it was a great easy read that made my days not feel quite so long.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Were despondent when we finished Breaking Bad, thinking no series could possibly hold a candle to it...until we started watching Homeland...STELLAR performances electrify a BRILLIANT script!!!  This golden age of television is SO intoxicating!!!  Homeland is a MUST!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this series this past summer while on location for work and it was a great easy read that made my days not feel quite so long.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Does what I need it to do, open pdfs. Makes it so I can bring knitting patterns on my kindle for knit night.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a good book to read.  It is different than the movie. I thought it was better than the movie.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga on my Kindle Fire.  I have it on two other devices but the Kindle Fire's screen is larger and playing is quick and enjoyable.  I have had no problems with it since downloading. It opens up quick and never is slow. I am very happy that Amazon got this game, If you love Candy Crush it is great on the Kindle Fire!!!!
B002ZG976U|5.0|my wife loves it I don't really but she makes me watch it and we have had no problems with it playing
B00D5YNQMW|2.0|C'mon guys, who thinks that a half-assed documentary style is what the public wants?<br />  I call it \\"Annoy Us Interruptus!\\"
B0043KK4N6|5.0|she loves it plays it all the time and very good sounding cd what can u say its a girl cd or some one that likes shear so it good for them
B00DW1WR14|4.0|First off, I have to laugh at people who give albums 1 star and write a review after listening to it once. It takes 2 weeks to finally \\"get\\" an album.... Pearl Jam has been my favorite band since 1994 when I was in Gr. 11. When I first listened to Lightning Bolt on the free iTunes stream a week before it came out, I thought, \\"I don't know about this, it's mellow\\". However, I've been listening to this album non stop for 3 weeks, and I feel I can finally give an honest review now.<br /><br />If you can finally come to terms that they'll never write another Ten, vs, or Vitalogy, and the guys aren't angry 20 year olds anymore, you'll agree that this album is very good. I've been saying for a few years, if Pearl Jam decided to call it a career, I'd be happy. Now with Lightning Bolt, I'm excited to see what's coming up next. It's like they've reached another stage of their career, again. Every 3 albums they seem to reinvent themselves, and being album #10, it's the beginning of phase #4 in their career.<br /><br />The stand out tracks for me are, Mind Your Manners, My Father's Son, Infallible, and Swallowed Whole. Actually the entire album is good, there isn't a filler on here. I get chills every time in Lightning Bolt when Eddie sings, \\"You know you gotta let her go. She's a lightning bolt\\" with the guitar rifts playing. I'm a little disappointed they play that part only twice in the song, because it's so good :)<br /><br />Sirens gets better every time I hear it. Getaway is very good too. Let The Records Play, and Sleeping By Myself are different, but still well done. I go back to them not being angry 20 year olds anymore for those two songs. I can imagine female fans really liking Pendulum, Yellow Moon, and Future Days, especially Future Days.<br /><br />It's like I say with the new Alice in Chains, if you can't get over that Layne's not there anymore, and Pearl Jam isn't angry 20 year olds anymore, you're really missing out! The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here could be AIC best album, but this isn't the time or the place to review that one.<br /><br />Rock and Roll needed Soundgarden, Alice in Chains, and Pearl Jam to release new albums. The other stuff out now, other then The Black Keys and the Sheepdogs, is dull. I refuse to buy the new STP without Scott, but maybe I should take my own advice and give it a try :)
B00008WT5J|5.0|This album is for any rockers that likes it hard and awesome!! You can listen to this album now and in twenty years you will still get in to it and feel it! AC/DC knows how to ROCK! If you don't like this album then there is something wrong with you.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I am watching it with my Granddaughters, ages 13 and 16!<br /><br />We all love it!  We are now watching season 2.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|You don't want to stop until you complete the level, so you try and try until finally  it happens. Then onto the next o e.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I used to play this on Facebook but I got tired of all the &quot;help friends&quot; requests. I was so excited when I saw apps available for the Kindle. Finally!!! Crushin' on!!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The display is big enough to see. The keys are large enough so that you hit the one you aim for. This is a great calculator.
B00FEN1C50|5.0|Nice to have a movie and not have to worry about scratching copy!  Really good special effects!!!!  Iris Elba is my new boyfriend.&#34;We are canceling the apocalypse!!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I was never a star student in English class back in high school. But I never thought a book with this many grammatical errors and spelling mistakes would make it past editors and be published like this. I feel like it was written by a 6th grader. Also had no intention of buying the 2nd and 3rd books but really this should be called fifty shades volume 1 they are not separate books it ends in the middle of a concept doesn't even give ANY type of closure with a tiny bit of making you want to purchase the next one. Very disappointed!! As for the whole level of &#34;erotica&#34; umm no. I have read many and I thought this was written horribly.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this series!  I was late getting started with the series and had to catch up before the new season started a few weeks ago.  Can't wait to watch the new show each week.
B0045HCIZY|5.0|Loved the characters, their words, the setting. This movie makes you to care for the characters and their story. It is a good film to talk about in the café.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't like giving spoilers so I'll try to not give anything away.  I know everyone is complaining about the ending and I have to agree with them.  I'm heartbroken over it.  Cried through the last 30 min of the book.  I'm one that likes happy endings and this was definitely not that book.  It shouldn't have ended that way.  My other BIG problem was that I kept having to try and remember whose perspective I was reading.  It was so hard to differentiate between Tris and Tobias like they were the same person with the same way of thinking.  If you have read the first two books you know that is far from the truth.<br />Tris and Tobias' relationship never grew they were still at the same place they were at the end of the first book.  Tris nor Tobias ever learned from any of their mistakes and just kept making the same ones over and over again.  It got very repetitive.  I'm very frustrated and feel ripped off by the author.  I've waited so long for this book and I just feel empty from it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie is easily one of my top 5 favorite. These four actors have a ton of fun in this movie and you can't help but laugh with them!
0142405809|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. The rhyme is great and story is one of friendship.  I would highly recommend for preschool age children!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love John Green's books and am always astonished after finishing every one of them. I feel mixes of emotions and each touch my soul in many different ways. They are amazing and I hope he continues to write for the rest of his life.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME AND I PLAYED ON FACEBOOK FIRST NOW I PLAY ON MY KINDLE BECAUSE IS EASY FOR ME TO BE ON TOP ALL THE TIME BUT I WISH YOU CAN ADD THE OTHER POWER UPS I USE WHEN I PLAY THE GAME ON FACEBOOK SO FAR SO GOOD BUT THE GAME WILL MORE FUN WITH THE REST OF THE POWER UPS THANKS IN ADVANCE AND PLEASE CONSIDER MY PETITION
B003Z0BWR2|2.0|This book is boring, i could only read half of it, because is boring, the first one of the saga is a lot better, and that is not a good thing
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Love it is awesome and so FUN SO FUN SO FUN SO FUN  GET THIS GAME you will love. It too
B00594XOZU|2.0|I've had my kindle fir for a year and have always had Kik messenger. I let my mother use it to read  a book and she didn't know my Passover and so therefore, she accidentally deleted everything on it.Kik messenger was still on the &quot;cloud&quot; section of my apps. I attempted to Que it  and it is apparently....unavailable.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|This is a well written ( of course it's Bill Bryson) anecdotal history of the raring 20's containing many facts and factoids that I had never known.  One Summer is entertaining and enlightening but if you have read any of his prior books you already know that.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A must read.  Packed with action more than any book I have ever read! I highly recommend this book. You will be satisfied, I promise.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|okay it's a very long book but sets up her next 2.  It's really a love story with some historical overtones but halfway through i didn't want to put it down.  How does a mind like this work?  i sure don't know but i very much enjoyed reading the beginnings of a saga.  FYI, cable is making this a series which should be pretty darned good!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Was waiting for Candy Crush to be available on Kindle. Yay! I find myself playing it even more often. Thank-you Kindle!!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love this story between eva an  gideon....couldnt put the book down even if my life depended on it! Absolutely amazing!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love the Candy Saga it is a challenge for me & it is so much fun trying to get to the next step. My whole household is hooked and instead of watching TV we sit around and have a contest of who can make it up the ladder without having to do it more than once.<br /><br />Keep it coming!!!! ove the game.
0847842134|1.0|The back 1/4 cover of this book is covered with a HUGE ugly white sticker that can't be removed. I carefully attempted to get it off and just ended up ripping apart the special paper the cover is made of. This book is a beautiful work of art. The printing and paper are really unlike anything I've ever seen. It's gorgeous. Why would the publisher ruin the back cover with a HUGE sticker that can't be removed?
B00FOWX6NM|2.0|I removed both plastic coverings and a saw two deep scratches. I was disappointed as i had hoped this case would have been better Oh well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so much fun! I'm kind of addicted to it! I wish there were more levels though. either way its a blast.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|This is by far the best Backstreet Boys CD.  Everytime I listen, I have a new favorite song.  There is nothing \\"Boy\\" about it.  Well worth buying!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Can't wait for the next ! Perfect story for those who like epic fantasy stories. Kvothe is just absolutely the best character I've seen recently in my readings
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I loved Pam's book. I did most of the experiments in the book and it really opened my eyes. It was a read that I really needed at this particular time in my life. This book is a catalyst for me to take more control and responsibility for my life. This book re-strengthened my faith in God and in myself.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I read so I have a kindle FIRE and became soooooooo happy I can now play on my kindle!! This game is addicting!!
B00E3DC2D8|5.0|This is a timeless classic and I don't feel qualified to write a review! However, I will mention that once you get used to reading 'old style english' and if you have personal experience of the scene in which the story is set, you will find this an enjoyable experience.
0061537969|5.0|This was a fun and heart-warming book and having it written from the perspective of the dog was a genius idea!  The pet's narrative was spot on for how you would expect a dog to talk.  I absolutely loved it!
1742204147|4.0|Lonely Planet has organized the book into four color coded sections (in order of appearance): Plan Your Trip, On the Road, Understand, and Survival Guide. The 'Plan Your Trip' section is by far the most interesting -- and the briefest. It details some of the most eye-catching and famous destinations alongside photographs and useful general information for visiting the country. On the Road is more a directory organized by city/region listing local attractions accompanied by a blurb no longer than a few paragraphs. Long sections of dense information in the second section are occasionally broken up by large full color illustrations such as a map of the Tokyo National Museum and a cutaway of the Todai-ji. Though by occasionally, I mean that those are actually the only two illustrations for the remaining 800 pages. There are numerous maps every few pages as well, varying in usefulness. This section dominates about 70% of the book with the others filling roughly 10% apiece. Filling out the end, Understand comprises an extensive timeline of Japanese history along with modern culture and customs. The Survival Guide combines pricing charts, general information and a short phrasebook at the end with written Japanese and English phonetics (which is really nice). The last two sections really help flesh it out as a more general purpose guide but it's still a bit too dense to serve as a nimble guide to planning a vacation. I can see this being very useful as a resource to pull out if you're wondering what to do next once you actually wind up in Japan, but it's probably not the best resource for figuring out where you want to visit when you do go. Be aware of the book's strengths and weaknesses before buying.

B00F87ZUYG|4.0|So far, season 4 is off to a slow start but overall, it's an awesome show! I'm a big fan.
B00D2PIUAM|5.0|Love this CD it's a great album placebo is my favorite band. Give it s try you might like them!!!???
B00DJ4PIBK|5.0|I bought a little ahead of time but I bet will be nice surprise in December. It should be much healthier than chocolate version :-)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am glad you added to Kindle Fire . All my friends and family have been playing and it is nice to be able to play along with them.
1451666179|5.0|First, I highly recommend the paperback.  I buy most of my books for Kindle, but this book is beautifully produced and worth it - plus you can't share a Kindle book with your friends who have never heard of Hyperbole and a Half to convert them to the Dark Side.<br /><br />The book contains a total of 18 stories, each one printed on different colored paper (thick glossy paper, not normal paperback novel paper), which creates a very fun effect.  7 of the stories are from the blog of the same name and the rest are new, but written and illustrated in the same style as the blog.  They range from hilarious to hysterical, with a few dark exceptions (namely the depression stories from the blog).  I enjoyed reading it at least as much as I enjoy the blog, if not more.  Allie's extraordinarily unusual life and gift for storytelling are uniquely entertaining.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I really wanted this thing to work. Unfortunately, it never did. I never was able to get it set up. Every time I went through the process, I was told that my UPnP on my router was not enabled. I went into router settings, and it was in fact enabled.<br /><br />So I contacted Google's customer service by phone. Talked to a guy  who seemed like he was trying to be helpful. He couldn't solve my problem, but said he would refer my case to a supervisor who would email me in 24-48 hours. Well, that never happened, so I called again. I talked to another person who saw no record of my complaint, but assured me that he would take care of it and make sure a supervisor contacted me. No one ever did.<br /><br />So, I returned the Chromecast and ordered a Roku instead. Very happy with that product over the Chromecast.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I would like the option to earn the super candy and extra turns and not be limited to purchasing items.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|This is a cult movie. You either hate it or love it.  I personally love it.  Smarmy models turn heroes.  Hilarious if you don't take it too seriously.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Turned my TV into a &#34;smart TV&#34;...now can watch live stream on big screen instead of just tablet or laptop.....
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved the book mostly because of Khaled Hosseini's beautiful penmanship.  The story is beautiful, heartbreaking at times, and wonderfully told.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Suits just keeps getting better and better.  The character development, the back stories, they just make it one of my favorite shows of all-time. Can't wait to see what's next.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I got this for my wife for her birthday, and I must say this is now one of my favorite albums too.  I bought it after we saw them live and these tunes will get stuck in your head, especially Moves Like Jagger
B005544V6A|5.0|Suits is an amazing show!  My brother told me to check it out and I was hooked!  Watched the first 2 seasons in like 2 1/2 weeks.  It's that good!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|It is one of the best shows on cable.  This sets the bar for any other scary /sci fi show on TV.  If you follow the comic series, it follows to a certain point then goes off to another level so always keeps you guessing.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|If you like any previous music from Jack Johnson, you'll like this too. It's another good album; some upbeat songs, some mellow ones, but all of them with Jack's great voice and beats.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This shows keeps getting better and better each season, and the viewership grows each episode.  This puts any other scary show to shame
0307271080|5.0|The book is more \\"non-fictional\\" philosophy about life than it is the experiential biography of African immigrants in the West. There are some tough questions asked about race, but more importantly, lessons for immigrants, especially Africans, to consider before they move to the West. Also, the lesson that moving back to Africa is not always hopeless; that the continent is moving forward in many ways in spite of its challenges, contrary to what is in news media especially on TV in the West - mostly misery and hopelessness in society. The myriad humorous moments may only be understood by those who have had the African experience in some fashion!
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Jam packed double album, second side live tracks with guest artists, Dr. John and many other well known guests. Warren Haynes and the rest of the band great value blues album.
1449305172|5.0|This book belongs alongside the great Lean books by Ries and Blank - concise, efficient and actionable, I use templates from this book with each and every entrepreneur that I work with to determine their business model.  Looking forward to his next book!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|We have been waiting FOREVER for Amazon to offer this game for the Kindle.  Finally, we can play it on a device other than the Ipod!!!  LOVE this game!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging.  Makes you think ahead several moves so it is a good mind challenge.  Each level is a new challenge.
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|I purchased these cords for my sister and niece, both of their current cords, deteriorated to a point bare wires were exposed.  Hopefully Amazon,com has a better cord this time.  I have read many issues regarding the old cords.
B009V0TV6O|4.0|Good, solid metronome. Does exactly what you would expect. Has pre-made exercises which are neat, and it's easy to change both the time signature or note type. Nice range of tempo up to 600 bmp so it can be used for most anything you would want to play.<br /><br />Only real downsides are it's lack of a vibrate feature anywhere I could see and not the greatest variety of sounds that you can switch it to. I play drums and could really use a vibrating or highly visible metronome. Failing that it's really all you need for this type of app.  Worth the price.
0399159347|1.0|Wasn't a fan. Found it predictable, lacking in depth and not particularly believable. The only thing I learned was the difference between a Macaron and a Macaroon.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Chapters 57- epilogue made it all worth while. I enjoyed the entire book, but the way  Ms Moriarty tied all the loose ends was beautiful. Insights reflected all married couple's woes,and in a way struck closely to home. There are few books I refer back to because of the lessons they present. This will be one.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is very addictive and fun.I have a lot of fun playing if u like keel blitz and stuff like that, you will have so much fun
B005ZB91KY|5.0|Classic avengers film done top quality as always. Historical nazi and WW1 parallels are an interesting twist. Rent it now!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google search is the only search engine I use.  I tried Bing and Ask. com.  Neither offers as many links as Google.  Why  leave what works?
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The first chapter of the book is pretty creepy and I was worried about reading the book right before bed. That worry was short-lived as the rest of the book doesn't really fit under the horror genre for me. I like where King takes Dan Torrance and there are parts of the book that are really excellent, but it seems like he is just playing with the shining powers he gives Dan and Abra - they seem able to do anything they want without fail. I would think they would stumble a bit in honing their skills.(view spoiler) I felt like Abra and Dan together were pretty much all-powerful and that there really wasn't much of a conflict toward the end. Interesting story but I would have liked a bit more like chapter 1!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Those of  you suggesting similar games:<br />This is  the game that all of them are BASED on. (Except maybe bejeweled)<br />Addictive if anything and fun.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Since downloading this app, my husband now enjoys reading. He always takes his tablet with him, and doesn't mind having to wait around while I shop. It's great.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Super!! Way cool game. Get it. For real. It's awesome! I really like the cute little dragons,earning gold just to write a review?! Ok.
B00DW1WR14|1.0|My dad is out of control.  I can't stand it anymore.  All the dude plays is Pearl Jam.<br />Pearl Jam in the car.  At home.  Pearl Jam T-Shirts.  (He used to make me wear them...uggg.)<br />Pearl Jam discussions.  Pearl Jam coffee.  Pearl Jam license plate. (PJ10Vedr)<br /><br />I can't stand it.  I love him and stuff, but he's really hard to be around.<br />I embarrassed to have him drive me and my friends places.<br />He always pops in Pearl Jam or puts it on the stupid Pearl Jam station.<br />Like anyone needs Pearl Jam 24/7.  But people do...like my dad.<br /><br />He thinks he's getting music cred by playing it.  My friends are polite, but it's very embarrassing.<br />They are all like, \\"Dude, your dad's music sucks.  What's up with that lead singer?  He's always Yaaarling and Groaning...and the songs have no melody.  Your dad's music sucks.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know,\\" I say.  \\"But your dad listens to Phish...so....\\"<br /><br />It's bad, and a lot of my friends have similar problems with their dads being mad wack.<br /><br />I have one whose dad just plays Dave Matthews all the time.  Or the one who plays Phish.  That really sucks.  That guitar dudes solos grate on my ears.  Makes me wanna vomit.  They go nowhere fast.  I guess people are into dudes who play fast???  Can't forget the Rush dad....wow...horrible.<br /><br />I'm not alone, but sometimes I feel like I am.<br /><br />This new album came in the mail.  (My dad still buys music.)<br />And he is reenergized with Pearl Jam love.<br />It's almost unbearable.  He had a listening party at his house with all of his friends.<br />They think they know a lot about music because they are into Pearl Jam.<br />Try to pass it off on me...it's pathetic.<br /><br />They all got drunk and I went upstairs to surf the net.<br />They all started playing their favorite Pearl Jam songs.<br />\\"Daughter\\" came on and they all sang it at the top of their lungs.<br />So pathetic....It's a horrible song.  Who writes songs about peoplewith learning disabilities?<br />Yo.  I got this sweet song.  It's about a girl with LD.  Cool.  Not.<br />And here are these grown men singing about this...<br />Why?  I can't even fathom.  The song is so wack.  It must give them something missing in their lives.<br /><br />They partied all night.  It was their Wild Hogs moment.  I hope they had fun.<br /><br />When I woke up in the morning, I head music coming from the bathroom downstairs.  I walked by and saw my father standing in front of the mirror with a radio on singing \\"Nothing Man\\" as he stared at himself.  WTF?<br /><br />It's just been absolutely terrible.  And my dad started liking Pearl Jam in 1993.  For 20 years they have been his favorite band.  He really doesn't listen to anything else.  He may listen to some U2, Tom Petty, Led Zeppelin, or Black Crows...but 95% of the time it's Pearl Jam.  I usually get bored of band after a couple of months.  I like to explore and taste the world.  Not my dad.  Pearl Jam forever.<br /><br />When I was a baby, I didn't even like music.  I would cry when the teacher started to play the piano for sing alongs in kindergarten.  I thought she would start Yarllling and Grunting and Growiling.  It took years of reconditioning for my ears to accept music.  All because my dad wouldn't stop listing to dumb Pearl Jam.<br /><br />So.  If you like Pearl Jam, buy this album.  It will fulfill you delusion.  Have fun with it.  Run with it.  Pearl Jam for life.  I don't care.<br />I love my dad.  He's been pretty cool to me and my mom and sister.  I'm pretty lucky.<br />I wish he would give Pearl Jam a rest tough because, inadvertently I end up listening to way more Pearl Jam then is ever needed.  And their bland, faux rock and roll dulls my world.  And makes me seasick.<br /><br />I just wish he were into cooler music.<br /><br />Maybe someday I'll be the same.<br /><br />But I doubt it.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|while I have completed. almost 50 levels for free I still don't know why some jellies take one time to be removed and others take 3.  also have no idea what some of the &quot;helps&quot; even do.  the big sucker pounded the board but appeared to accomplish nothing.  a litttle more instruction would be very helpful.
B00BATKPBE|2.0|I am a big fan of Richard Dawkins but this book fell short of my expectations. In particular for the Kindle edition the peculiar layout chosen for a very great number of extracts of poems by various authors is a disaster. They are printed vertically, one letter to a line for pages and pages - they are nearly impossible to read, and to me personally were simply exasperating. The actual content if you deduct all this padding is an anorexic little story - Dawkins deserved a better editor. I still admire Dawkins and will certainly reread many of his works but this one should be redone.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Very interesting piece of history with good characters.  The parts from the past are much better written than the scenes in the present but it's a good read.
B00EUUJID6|3.0|I was spoiled by their first two albums.  This one is just okay.  I don't think the music compliments their voices as much as their previous selections.
B001AW156U|3.0|Well, after I put the triggers on they looked....crooked...I don't know if it was just me going crazy, but they appeared to be slightly higher on one side than the other.  Compared to some other ones I had in the past, these also fell off much easier.  I blame Sony for making the PS3 triggers the way they did...<br /><br />The analog pad covers are nice!  I like the feel of these things, and they fit real snug...so I don't see them falling off any time soon.
1451666179|5.0|My only complaint is it is too short, but alas all good things are.  Just good old fashion storytelling if there is ever one.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|I liked this movie it was very Steven Spielberg/ET like. It kept my attention<br />And the leads were all good.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|To be honest, I bought this book when some school district banned it for its language.  Didn't expect to be drawn into a story whose target audience is teens.  I couldn't put it down, and will definitely encourage teenagers in my family (and their parents) to read it.
B00EYE0ECW|5.0|Works great.  It is easy to use.  Just what you need. Great detail for map.  I use it all the time.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|This collection is the foundation piece of the Game of Thrones TV series. The series follows the books faithfully but the nuances of the written text add to the readers appreciation wether they are TV fans or bookies.
B00AA7V2Z0|5.0|Until recently I have not had much interest in horror. I needed a new genre to explore and this show is fantastic. Every season is a new plot line and many of the same actors play new roles.
B009NX6JCI|2.0|The connection of the five stories takes much too long to develop. The lack of a tangible thread of interest affects the audience's peception of the performances and tends to reduce what might have otherwisse been seen as strong portrayals. This is a directorial mistake.
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|The formula that worked for parts 1&2 had no place in part 3.  This movie could of been less predictable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching this series when I bwas home ill.  Well I got better and so does the show?  Always twist and turns.  Some make you laugh, sone make you cry.i hope everyone takes time to watch this series.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sometimes children should appreciate their parents. Life is not a given. Sometimes life has surprises and they are not what you expect. Parents don't owe their children what they did in their life time.
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Horrible, muddy, ridiculous script. Not even a smoldering Brad Pitt could save it.  However, the makeup, effects and cinematography were pretty awesome. Ok, I'll go back and give it another star for the effects.
B008Q08IV4|5.0|I saw this when it came out. When you watch it over again there are parts you missed the first time. It is a great movie. One that makes you think about a lot of things in life. I do believe this was the intent. Great movie for a Sunday afternoon or any time
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a wonderful game its easy and passes the time well. my 3yo loves to play this game . I love the weekly challenges
B000E33W1W|5.0|Ghostbusters remains a popular movie 30 years after its release. It has become a comedy classic. It is a wonderfully absurd film. If you are a fan of Monty Python, The Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, The Blues Brothers, etc., then you appreciate absurd humor, and understand why this movie endures.
0440237688|3.0|Great for teens, kind of boring for adults.  The plot was interesting but took forever to get to the point.  It will be interesting to see how they make an entire movie out of this novella.
0062255657|4.0|Other reviewers have written long and thorough reviews of this book so I'm not going to. However, I will note the following. I am normally reading several books at one time. At home I usually have one book by my bedside to read before bed and one at the dining room table to read while eating. Originally The Ocean at the End of the Lane was my bedtime reading, but I found it so disturbing that I had to move it downstairs. This is about the highest praise I can give to a creepy book like The Ocean at the End of the Lane. Also, I got teary-eyed reading the acknowledgements. Neil Gaiman rocks.
0375831002|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read!  Once I finished I immediately wanted to read it again.  Please buy a copy for every book lover you know!
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Revenge<br />In a sweet tender way the author reveals his innermost deep emotions. There is nothing like poetry to take you from one phase of life to the next. In this book of poems Revenge of The Orgasm, it is clearly a group of stages. His loves, his fears, his inhibitions all comes out in the different poems. There were a lot of moments that were identifiable. A lot of things mention, said or eluded to that seemed so familiar.<br /><br />Names and faces flashed across my mind. One poem was titled Her Tattoo and described the tattoos of a beautiful Latina sister with heaven written on her body was truly heaven for him. Another poem is titled Her Hands. By time the book is done we have discovered many parts of the `hers' in his life. This book is perfect for candlelight, low music, and a favorite drink on a romantic night.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Now I know what all the buzz is about. Great game. Love playing it on my KindleFire!  Try it, you'll love it!
B008Q00KEW|4.0|Great plot twist. Absolutely terrific graphics, and the altimate ending of the series. A must see for trekies. Take tissues with you.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Good, but I like the first star trek movie better. I thought this one needed a liitte more action, but still good.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game! Very cute animals. Love how many options there are for earning money and acorns. I would give 5 stars, but I don't like how if you accidentally tap on new land you've bought it. Be very careful when tapping on the screen! Other than that I highly recommend this game!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like this game because, you have to use your head to solv the puzzle so it's fun and help you with using your brain.
B00AHSF4AQ|5.0|is there anyone who doesn't love this movie? My favorite is Dorrie, but all the characters are adorable. Perfect for adults and kids. Seriously, watch it with your kids!
B00ALSOKSY|5.0|Great Book! Learned a lot of information about why people make the decisions they do. And why people often don't make the best financial choices
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|It took me a while to get on board, but this is a seriously funny and insightful move. The scene where  Bradley Cooper is horrified by his (sort of) girlfriend's social deficit is worth the price of admission. If you like movies about people who have taken a left turn and don't know how they got there, you'll enjoy this.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Excellent as always when one takes On a Stephen King novel. Always waiting for the next best read and Mr. King never disappoints!!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|Bazinga! This is one of the best show on TV. I'd rather watch reruns of TBBT than pretty much anything else except NCAA football. Just get on board.
B0089LOG02|5.0|An American history lesson told in Novel.  Very well written.  The people in the novel seemed real and I felt such a love for these children who went through unbelievable adversity.
B00F880BWG|5.0|I absolutely love it. I can't wait for next week. Being that I travel a lot I have WD at my finger tip from amazon. Amazon you rock. No commercials and better quality.  The show itself is amazing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there's so many games I love this game it passes the time in the car and it fun to compete with ur friends
B0060MYK7G|5.0|A crime family you can't help but love. Suspense, love its all here with history told at its most entertaining level.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is a &#34;must see&#34; movie during the Christmas season. We watch it every year, over and over again. Sometimes I even sneak it in July!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love this product it made my life way easier. The only complain or dislike I have is that it gets disconnected sometimes and I have to keep switching the TV and Laptop until the icon shows back in the laptop.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|Cool Hand Luke, is outstanding.  Great cast of characters, as well as incredible acting.  Luke is an outsider that never was part of something until he was put in jail.  He spends all his talents trying to get out, while encouraging his cell mates to fight and question everything no matter how trivial.  Paul Newman gives a stellar performance.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Forrest Gump never gets old.  I watch it time and time again and now I find it as a useful tool in teaching my kids.  Forrest Gump covers topics that in most cases would make parents uncomfortable to discuss with their children, approachable.  You will find that the movie covers topics such as judging people, sacrifices parents make for their kids, war, discrimination, determination, following through with a promise, donating to a good cause, and above all unconditional love.<br /><br />Next time you watch it, keep all of that in mind and you will see the movie in a whole different light.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I enjoy this show so much! Funny, witty characters. Some good ol' drama. Gabriel Macht is my favorite character!! Watch it!
B009EE13R2|5.0|Hello Dolly is by far one of my favorites musicals of all time!  The fact that I can watch it in HD at the touch of a button on my TV at any given time through Amazon Prime, is music to my ears!  Love Love Love this movie!
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Another terrific British series....  well acted and well scripted.  I was sorry to see it end.  I would definitely recommend it.
B0035LMTZA|4.0|The writing wasn't the best and you could almost tell the characters thought that also. Glad I didn't pay to see it in a theater. Worth watching at home.
1449305172|5.0|A book written not to sell books, but to actually guide you through the process of launching a new business.<br />The author is actually committed to experiment, learn and teach us through the process and all its complexities and this work is clearly sintesized and shown in the book.<br />Launching is not easy, but having this book really helps, provides guidance and &#34;peace of mind&#34;<br />Looking forward for the next book with new advise
B005544TRQ|5.0|After enjoying Downton Abbey on my Kindle, I found Suits.  Just finished watching the first season and now in the second, then will watch the third.  Looks like it may come back for a fourth season???  If so, I will be watching it!
B007EC27QM|1.0|This application doesn't properly handle basic math. It gets order wrong and makes assumptions about data entry that causes it to provide incorrect results. Run away if you want an accurate basic calculator.  Pretty design is great but you need to get the core functionality correct!
B004JMY312|5.0|I grew up watching this movie and introduced my nieces to last week. They loved it, it's prefect Halloween movie for their age.
B005RDF2RG|5.0|Great family movie.  This is one that I know my husband will sit down and watch with us because it is so funny.
0316204366|3.0|I'm nearly done with this book and while there are some interesting anecdotes, I don't think it all holds together like some of his earlier work, like &#34;What the Dog Saw,&#34; and &#34;Outliers.&#34;
B004C3DLJS|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie.  Mr and Mrs Potato Head are some of her favorite toys.  Its cute to see how much better she treats her toys now.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|I liked the practical approach and viewpoints given on remote work.<br /><br />The fact that the people writing the book, are also selling tools to help remote work, creates a little filter in my brain, telling me to not believe everything. But then again, pretty much everything makes very good sense. Both the angel and devil speaks to me :)<br /><br />It gave me a lot of good 'ammunition', that i will try out with Live Fire where i work. Just to see what happens :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Drives me crazy, but I love it.  It is also a good way to keep in touch with friends across the nation. It makes us feel closer than we are
B009NX88JU|5.0|Amazing acting, super cool plot, great writing and quotes! &#34;The only currency left in this bankrupt world is what u share with someone when ur uncool.&#34; Enough said.
0061950726|5.0|This is a very touching book. The writer has a way of captivating you from the very start. I got a little anxious when the storyline would switch from modern day to decades earlier, but it makes sense once you read further on. By the end of the novel, you really feel like you personally know the characters. I immediately gave this book to my sister-in-law to read once I was done reading it so that I could have somebody else to talk to about the storyline. We both thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!
B004SIP6N6|5.0|While bluray can't really improve the quality much (as it was filmed on very low budget cameras), you can still tell the difference. It looks a little clearer and it's worth it anyway for the price.<br /><br />Clerks is one of those movies everyone needs to see. Sure, it's extremely vulgar, but they bring up a lot of great points in conversation that anyone can relate to. If you've worked in retail before, this is definitely the film for you.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it already, pick it up for sure.
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|The author achieves this end by skillfully describing the Damascus Accident and interspersing it with the history of our nuclear weapons development and inclusion (or non-inclusion) of the various safeguards.  The risk factors are made clear at every turn.  Accident theory is described and discussed at length.  Technical details of the various mechanisms are made very understandable to the non-science community.  Likewise, Three Mile Island is well explained.  This book is truly a remarkable undertaking.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Just didn't get it, A lot of friends and family are into this game, Thought I would try it when Amazon offered the app<br />No chance that I will become addicted, sorry just didn't appeal to me.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I haven't found a series that captivated me this much since the Hunger Games! Amazing book! Can't wait to read all 3 again! Thank you for doing a movie so I can see all the awesome charters once again. And all the negative ending reviews are WRONG! Life is not a happily ever after and I love how the author ended it! Of corse i would like to read a happy ending but that's not real! This book is everything I look for in a YA series! So worth the tears! It moved me how a book should! So read it with an open mind! Truly amazing words!
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|This was hard to navigate on my tablet, I don't knowwho their target costumers are, didn't work well on my tablet.<br />Sometimes the text had a faded look and was hard to read, however I found it easy to set up an account.I find most<br />Accounts cantankerous and hard to sign up.
B00DHQI2QS|5.0|Great court room drama.  Well worth watching.  Looking forward to Season 3 to see how the characters continue to develop.
B00062PN6I|5.0|These headphones don't fit perfect and they feel a little cheap but for ten dollars they deliver excellent sound quality.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander is like a foreign correspondent - he went somewhere only a few of us have been and reported back. His tale isn't colored by religious ideology - his journey was universal, and something people of any faith can accept. I was an agnostic before, but since he evolved from a place of skepticism, I trusted him. We definitely have a creator - there is no doubt. And honestly? What a relief. Atheism is a lonely place.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Intresting product with a good price.<br />If you want something to look videos y your Lcd by HDMI buy this!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|And thank god. Like &#34;If I Stay,&#34; the story is dark and universal. I kept picturing Jennifer Lawrence as the main character, though I know Shailene Woodley is playing her in the movie. Also great casting. A beautiful, dark tale. Cancer sucks at any age.
B009MB682W|4.0|it should include Adele's hit song even though it is quite recent.<br />however, i enjoyed discovering some of the older Bond songs.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|When I was a kid, it was basically RL Stine and VC Andrews. But even a woman in her 30s can latch on to this tale. Brilliant - and dark. For kids today, it's a perfect primer for the road ahead.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is a fun and challenging game to play.<br />Fun game to play on any touch screen games and computers.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I am the same age as the narrator - I was a high school freshman in 1991 - and related to this on so many levels. His English teacher even assigned the same books! I haven't seen the movie yet, but the book stands on its own.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I loved this book.  A great novel that leaves you with more questions than it answers and absolutely draws you in to its world.<br /><br />Great for anyone who likes fantasy.<br /><br />I recommend highly.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game does its job in a sort of splendid way. For all ages this game is. Each level has its own spin. The longer you play the harder it is, it will make you flustered but you'll enjoy it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Hey you ever get teased for liking my little ponies well I'm a 8th grade boy that works out and is the toughest in school and I like it give it a try or I will hurt you.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Suck a fun movie.  We watch it every Halloween. Tim Curry, Barry Bostwick, Susan Surandon, the entire cast is greeat.  The acting is very well done.  You can't ask for a better cheese fest.
B00E6G3SC6|4.0|Lord Mansfield was a towering figure in English law and this book does him and his life's work justice. Mansfield as a man was, like all of us, less than perfect, and Poser does not whitewash him. Neither does he anachronistically attempt to judge him by modern ethical or political standards. My only criticism is that Poser sometimes makes too earnest an effort to fill in the gaps, saying things like \\"we don't know exactly what was said but it might have been...\\". Definitely highly recommended.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the show, but very disappointed that Matthew is killed off.  Broke my heart.  Love him and Mary together.
1476727651|5.0|Just finished reading Doctor Sleep on the train this morning. What a great read Stephen King Fans of Stephen King! It was great learning about Danny Torrance as an adult. The book was frightening in subject matter but also very touching as it deals with real issues of life and death. I recommend this book very highly for any fans of 'The Shining' and for anyone interested in knowing what happened to the 'redrum' kid.
B00DU6UD0I|1.0|not a scary movie at all. i thought it was dumb. if you are the type that likes swaring and making fun then this is for you
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|I really searched for a case a) that would be minimal but actually protect my iPhone, b) that let the Champagne color show. This case seemed to be the one.  After it arrived, and after reading the critical remarks about scratching, I realized those folks probably did not remove the protective film from the inside and backside of the clear panel. Once that was done. the color shone as I wanted. But more impressive is the minimum bumper that does an excellent job of protecting. The die cuts were precise, the design great, it really is the best case I've had. Will the rear panel scratch? Probably. Sometimes my keys are in my pocket with the phone, so I can imagine they will occur. But that's called normal wear and tear. I'm a happy camper.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|What's in here? Irreverence. Some feisty. A little bit of rabies. Maybe even some mad grinning. Definite adult content (but not of the squicky kind). And now you'll have a convenient, slightly heavy way to con your friends into liking Allie! She is sweet and will be grateful. Most of the material is new, and all of it is A plus. Definitely spring for the paperback or hardcover. The pictures are what make Allie's work pop, and it just isn't the same on Kindle, not in color or clarity. My favorite is the creepy one of Allie in her parents' bedroom. If you've read it, you know which one I mean. Oh, yeah.<br /><br />How best to wrap this up?<br /><br />Dogs.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Very funny show, great acting and action. What more could you ask for? Yea the show only went for one season but it ended with a feature film that was also excellent so it's hard to complain.
1449305172|5.0|Running Lean is a great practioner's guide to using the lean startup philosophy. The books adds an additional set of insights to using a business model canvas and build-measure-learning your way from problem/solution fit to scaling.  I learned a bunch to apply to my world of book publishing and I have also used the book as a text in my class on entrepreneurial publishing at Portland State.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|I'm not going to go out on an extreme and complain about implausible premises over a magician movie, but the extravagance of these magicians' set-ups was just so over the top that it makes you shake your head.
B00992CF6W|5.0|What do you expect? It's minecraft. The best open ended game ever, on my kindle? I'll take a dozen please!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a wonderful book. Heartbreaking, strong, and lovely.  A look into the lives of some very ordinary German families in Nazi Germany.  Very well written.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of the very best Stephen King books I have ever read!  Would love to see more books involving these characters.  Loved the continuing story line!  Will not disappoint!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Cannot access anything whatsoever.  How to get a refund?  The machine absolutely REFUSES to respond to any request whatsoever.  Signed:  Disgusted
B000BBOV8U|4.0|It was a very good mix of Bryan Adams' classics with some new ones thrown in.  It was fun to listen to.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this app! its so fun and addictive! its a great game never glitches good graphics and also a great game in general
B0048WQDIE|5.0|If you have ever spent time in the military, you will love this book. I was not expecting it to be funny - it was hilarious. It is well written, and even people with zero military backround will enjoy it
B0083Z6AH6|3.0|It wasn't quite the romance I was looking for.  This was my first Jane Austen book and I was a little disappointed.
0553565915|5.0|Its a very enlightening book. It changed my life. I'm not alone in heartbreak and sorrows. It made me feel blessed.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This season is probably one of the best. There's a whole new slew of problems for the gang to face and they aren't messing around.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this after I watched the movie and was pleasantly surprised that the movie didn't miss too many details.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|I have never read a book and then started it over for the second time immediately - until now! This book is captivating. I have lost many hours of sleep on this one!
B00BMR5HOO|5.0|This app lets you see how the weather is for the whole week. They always update it. It also provides free apps too!!!
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Great scenery, music, characters, comical and a blast to play. Version 1 was good, but I like this one better than version 1.
B00F3WO0NS|5.0|I have been watching The Vampire Diaries since it first aired in back in 2009 and have not missed an episode
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|If you like regular &#34;Angry Birds&#34;,you'll really like Angry Birds Star Wars II, and it's FREE.The birds you sling shot, do all kinds of things, and their's extra points you can get, tho I don't really understand it all just yet, but I bet the kids could pick it up real quick, I just got this game,so I'm not very far into it, but I'm excited to see what's going to come next!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|waited for this, glad u got it and love this game!!! Now lets see you get other games on kindle not the wanna bees...
B00EDOS6IC|3.0|As a fan from day one, I had high hopes for this 4th effort as most AB fans did. It didn't particularly impress me upon first few listens, so I decided to give it a few weeks of repeated play before formulating and posting my opinion.<br /><br />The verdict,<br /><br />This is not their best work. Or perhaps I should say, this is NOT the direction I was hoping they would evolve towards. Absent is the soul in many of these songs. Myles vocals have lost their organic beauty, buried in overdubs and digital enhancements. The songwriting isn't what you'd expect from Tremonti, who in the past has always stressed the importance of melody.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are few great moments, like the &quot;Bleed It Dry&quot; guitar solo, and &quot;Calm the Fire&quot; is both haunting and brave at the same time with its &quot;Queen&quot; like intro.<br /><br />But unfortunately, and I hate to say this, but it sounds as if the boys made this album out of &quot;obligation&quot; and not out of their love for making great music and writing/playing great songs. Perhaps they've spent too much time with side projects, that they've lost some of the chemistry that makes Alter Bridge greater than the sum of its parts.<br /><br />Be wary of all the 5-star reviews. I think many die-hard AB fans are simply too drunk on the Kool-Aid to be objective.<br />I hope they course-correct with their next effort.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Awesome read! This story line just keeps getting better. Finally find out who Jon Snow's mother is and who is behind the Game of Thrones!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is freaking awesome! I cant stop playing. This game is very very addictive! My husband and Mother n law are also crazy about this game.
B008B8DY2O|2.0|For me this book is over written. I think it's a decent story that is hindered by excessive description and digression. The author launches into tangents, that last pages, which ad very little to the narrative and seem to be just excuses to show off his lexis.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I hate that we still live in a world where VGA is something that still needs to be dealt with.<br /><br />Fortunately, with this adapter, dealing with 1980's technology isn't as painful as the 1980's were.
B007MGWBU2|5.0|I must admit that I have always been a fan of the Muppets so I am certainly biased.  However, this film was a worthy addition to the Muppet portfolio.  It was full of good natured humor and entertaining music.  The jokes were witty and the story line was both original and hewed to the past.  My wife and I both love this film.  Oh, and our grandkids liked it too!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|I don't really know. But it clicks in and works.<br /><br />What else can I say? Stupid MagSafe port changed and I have old chargers.<br /><br />THANKS, OBAMA!
1449305172|5.0|You can apply these principals to any startup or startup project in a larger organization. This is a clear and well written book by a definitive thought leader in the Lean Startup space.
B00486070K|4.0|For the price this should be 1G Ethernet. There are many USB->1G alternatives.<br /><br />I think having to buy a Thunderbolt -> 1G adapter is a waste of a port.<br /><br />Other than that, this is a fine product. Would be perfect if it was < $15.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|Used it for a bit but got bored quickly. Ended up deleting after about a week or so.  But it was free.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Was looking forward to this release and was not disappointed. I really enjoyed this book and if you want to know what happened to Danny Torrance as an adult, this is the book to get.
B00A6D5GBE|3.0|Interesting game kept me going for a long time.  I usually get bored with games quickly but this one held my interest and is still on my phone after 6 months.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I looked at this book in the store when it first came out and gave it a pass. Then I decided to give it a chance a few weeks ago and it has turned out to be one of my favorite Stephen King books. Actually recommended it to a man who was waiting in the doctors office just yesterday.
B008L1DNGI|2.0|Never quite got this game and ended up being bored quickly.  Deleted after a short time. Worth a try since it is free.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|My 3 year old son can play this game easier than the first one. We think it is better than the first one. Good graphics and good game play.
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|Forrest Gump is one of the best movies ever done.  I can watch it over and over.  Tom Hanks is great!
B00640UICA|5.0|I play this with my 3 year old and he loves it. Even my wife likes the characters. It&#34;s a fun pattern game with some geometric learning value for kids. It gets challenging pretty fast but not unplayable.<br />Just making the little guys happy makes me happy.
B00ERH15WY|5.0|It's a fine album, but for those new to the party: They've been doing Christmas songs in live sets since at least the early 90's KROQ shows.  This is the first time they've put out a (non-bootleg) album with just Xmas songs on it, but this is far from anything &#34;new & different&#34; for them.  And you can stream this entire album for free on YouTube right now.
B00867HDTA|2.0|Boring and repetitive. Its interesting for the first round but after about 5 minutes I removed it. Just does not get any more interesting after a few minutes of play. Even my 3 year old got board after 5 minutes.
B008QTVNUI|1.0|There was no need for the nudity and language used. This could have been a great series but I am done with it.
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|Very addictive game with great graphics and characters. Got though all the levels and when back and did it again with the Alien.<br />The level progression is good, starts out easy but gets harder and frustratingly harder to the final levels but never too hard as to be unplayable.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|One of the best television series I've ever watched.  It's right up there with The Shield, Justified, Battlestar Gallactica and True Blood.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|Hackneyed and predictable. I am (was) a fan of DeMille until I read this book. He needs to move on to other subjects.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Fun and challenging. Once you start playing you don't want to stop. Great pastime for a waiting room. Good brain exercise.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I just started watching this show on Amazon Prime and my husband and I both LOVE it! :)  We are flying through all the seasons to catch up live
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i now have 5 extra lives when my phone runs out! i may need an intervention...<br />i am however not a fan of the colors. kind if blah.
B001BANK32|4.0|I wasn't sure if I had read this since it was out so long ago. But I couldn't put it down. I kept remembering some the parts of the movie and tried to compare.  But then I realized I needed to focus on the book. It's so much better!
B003DWU98U|5.0|superb acting and directing  NOTHING superfluous  Just pure drama at its best<br /><br />Elizabeth Taylor, Sandy Dennis and Richard Burton at the top of their game.
038533348X|3.0|Full review here on my blog: [...]<br /><br />Synopsis: The narrator John (or Jonah) sets out to write a book about what happened on the day America dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. He starts by looking into the life of one of the inventors of the atomic bomb, Dr. Felix Hoenikker. He begins by writing letters to his family and begins communicating with Hoenikker's youngest son, Newt. While he is investigating this family he discovers that the doctor also invented a substance he called ice-nine. Hoenikker's goal was to figure out a way to solidify mud so US Marines would not have to wade through it in battle. Ice-nine instantly turns all water to ice with a melting temperature of 140 degrees. Each of Hoenikker's three children are now in possession of a small piece of ice-nine. He runs into Newt on a plane while traveling to the island of San Lorenzo and is eventually introduced to the eldest son, Frank. It is though Frank that Jonah assume the roll of President of the island since the current President, \\"Papa\\" Monzano, is dying of cancer. In order to save himself the suffering of dying a slow and painful death \\"Papa\\" eats a small amount of the ice-nine, instantly turning himself to ice. As they are moving his body to a funeral pyre, part of him falls into the water and turns the oceans and all water in the world to ice, essentially destroying the world and almost all life with it.<br /><br />My review: I read this book because one of my favorite authors, Michael Bunker, is releasing a fan fiction book based in this \\"world\\". This book to me was just okay, better than some of the Kurt Vonnegut I have read but I can see why someone would decide to write a fan fiction story based off this book. The possibilities are endless. Only the last few pages actually touch on the world in a post-apocalyptic state after the world has frozen over and all plant and wildlife has been killed off. There are an infinite number of stories that can spread from this point on. I wonderif Kurt wrote a sequel to this story, I would be interested to see his idea of the world after the book ends and his expansion or ideas of the end of the world from this point on. While I have not been a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut's work, I do feel better that I have experienced his stories for myself and not just from the spoken or written word of others.<br /><br />My rating: 6<br />Pages: 287<br />Author website: [...]
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this is fun and easy(and I'm only10years OLD!)and if youthinksurvivalmode is2hard go to options and make it easy with no monsters it very creative and cool plus you can try out making a house pool or whatever(:(:(:!!!
B00FKTDKTO|5.0|I have loved Paul McCartney for many years now.  He never fails to amaze with his gift of melody and song.  Queenie Eye is a tune that gets stuck in the head.  Early Days is an answer to all those folks who choose to speculate about the relationship between Paul and John.  Every time I listen to this album, I hear something 'new' that I love about it!  Do yourself a favor and buy it!!
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love hidden objects games and this has become one of my favorites. I like how there are goals to reach besides just finding the objects in the scene.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love to play. Great fun to play. Not enjoying the 24 he wait on level 36. I desperately need some lives without havibg to spend $.
B005NACYQU|5.0|Compulsive reading from beginning to end. Grabs you and doesn't let go. Best to set aside time towards the end else you could be late for things... Like work....
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As a long time Stephen King fan the last couple of books that I've read by King have not met my expectations . I am happy to say that this one has captured my attention and held it. He successfully brings back the characters of the Shining and  presents an interesting tale to develop the characters. I have not finished reading it but enjoy it so much so far I feel comfortable recommending it.
006202406X|5.0|All you people giving one star reviews must be a bunch of immature children. This book was excellent. Did the ending make me sad? Of course it did. I'm heartbroken. But the ending fit. And I appreciate the careful, subtle thought that the author obviously used through out the whole series to set up the ending the way she did. Everything came together at the end and it made perfect sense. This series was beautiful, and is a deep look into the struggles of what it is to be human. So stop bashing the author for ending the series the way she saw fit. Stop whining that it didn't have the fairytale ending that we all so come to expect and...dare I say, be a little Dauntless?
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This  was an absolutely Great  family movie! It's  the best version of the story I've ever seen.  My  family loved  watching it.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|exciting and entertaining. This season is even better. Love the storyline and the characters. I highly recommend to anyone who likes this kind of show.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|lots of fun..can easily play a level and leave the game to do other tasks...can be very addicting...great ..love it
1572814349|5.0|I purchased this deck about five years ago and have used it in my practice nearly everyday since it was purchased.  It has been through thousands of readings by me.<br /><br />The artwork is exceptional and it is truly the only deck I can see myself using for another five years.  I am getting ready to purchase a second deck as my current one is getting a bit worn from use.<br /><br />You will not go wrong with this deck.  Ive used many decks in my lifetime but this is one of the best I have ever used.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I think this show is very good without the sex, bad language and scandal of most shows today, and it draws you in with every episode.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This series alone is likely to get me watching TV again.  I started (and recommend doing so) with the very first episode and have watched season 1 with interest and pleasure.  I definitely recommend this series and am well along with season 2 at this point.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Great show great story line. Couldn't put it down.. kept me on the edge of my seat. Can't wait to start season five.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Interesting to read about the law and jail system.. The ending was a surprise; from the innocent to the guilty.  If you like bucking the system, you'll like this one.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I choose the poorest rating because you have to be within 20' of your computer. This info should have been known before I bought. Great idea, but poor results.
B00BKZUVGM|1.0|I have followed with eagerness all of these books and cannot express sufficiently my disappointment in this finale. As another reader said, DON'T read this finale - make up your own ending. Someone else said they would not read another series by this author - I wholeheartedly agree. One of the many reasons we read is to escape, to see triumph over adversity. That was NOT achieved here
B00E32MUEA|5.0|Read it in college myself. A belief in quality shaped my life from that point on.  I think I need to reread it.
B001DHE9KG|5.0|I will watch it again and again.  It was almost like being in the theater.<br />I have recommended it to many of my friends.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|I liked the movie, it is nothing like the resident evil zombie outbreak. There is more plot and story. Still not a film for children. Not a stupid cheesy \\"B\\" movie spin off like \\"flight of the dead\\" seriously?
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. The hero, Dan (Danny from The Shining) inspired me to such sympathy for how his life had turned out.  And the &#34;bad guys&#34; are really bad --- scary, evil, true Stephen King.
B003477DVK|4.0|Great story about a young lad growing up feeling somewhat astranged from his father and peers. Then comes Skip. Skip turns things around for his best friend. The movie has a good story, some life lessons learned, humor, tension and some tear jerking drama making this a very good flick in my opinion for all ages. Particularily suited for family night. Very entertaining.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|Loved the video when it came out, and this feels like a logical extension of it =)<br />I do feel they should work out how to include the characters they left out from the video, though. Would recommend to anyone who has watched the video that inspired the game, and even those who want a quick pick-up game! Look forward to some bug fixes though that cause the game to crash on my Nexus 4 at times, and the (onscreen) back button not working throughout the app.
B008XG1X18|3.0|I actually forget about Pinterest.  I know many people like it and I think I'd like it more if it was more limited to categories.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|too bad the player has to wait so long to continue playing but i understand its to encourage one to buy. this game is so fun!! i love it!
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This became a boring app very fast after I downloaded it.  I found myself playing it less and less with time.
0385743564|5.0|With the exception of Warbreaker, every book this man writes is awesome. And Warbreaker is still worth the read.  Don't get me wrong, Sanderson is not a perfect writer, even he admits that, but his stories are engaging and you connect with his characters.  My only question Brandon... How do you write these things so well when you write so bleeding fast!?
B0056VGOZI|5.0|This is my favorite book by Steinbeck.  It's a different style of writing than his other books and he's very descriptive.  The book is also good with the character studies.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The characters in this show are all so complicated and wonderful.  I love how the story develops. I hope they make more seasons because I will watch them all!
B00BSBR9N6|4.0|This book was fairly good.  It lost my interest at times but I still enjoyed it.  It was very funny.
B00E7RZEI0|5.0|Fun graphics, easy to pass the time with.  Love the characters.  Makes me interested in company's other games offered, possibly.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Goggle search and it's one of the major venues for me to find out something on the internet.
B00EJOCB4G|5.0|This is for minecraft fans over the age of 8 due to some levels of difficulty. Great fun as a group project.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I have this program on my laptop, Kindle, Ipad and Iphone and I love it.  It's easy to use and has really improve my French.  I highly recommend it.  It's also free!
B00EJOCAYW|5.0|My grandson loved adding this to his previous minecraft Lego set. Now he can not wait to build more. Good value for the price.
B001KP2Y3K|3.0|I actually like some of her other cd's better but this is a good cd, too.  She's a great singer.
B00CO5AQ12|5.0|This stuff is a ton of fun to play with. The video's show exactly what it does, they aren't making anything up, its great!
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I haven't seen this movie yet and I gave this as a gift. But I've been told that it's an excellent movie to watch.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was awesome! I loved &#34;The Shining&#34; and &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; was a very good sequel. I would recommend &#34; Doctor Sleep&#34; to everyone. Stephen King is a awesome story teller!
1400052181|3.0|This was an interesting book but it did get tedious at times.  The story was fascinating and I'm glad I read it.
0062073192|5.0|I gave this as a gift and she loves it; warning though, its only from the first two seasons, anything else mentioned after that isnt in there, but its cool anyways. Love the drawings in it too
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds and I really like her voice.  There's a great variety of songs on this cd.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|The controller has a large deadzone around the joysticks. Definitely noticeable. Shortly after getting them they also started sticking. Later after that no signal would get sent from the joystick. I got two and they both have issues. These guys need to work on their thumbstick engineering. The rest of the controller is impressive so it's a shame.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a great product for sharpening knives.  I've used it several times and I've never been disappointed with it.
B001GXF2YY|5.0|A murder investigation involving a well known victim clashes with racial tensions, a coverup to protect senior officials, a cover up to slow the deteriating confidence in the LAPD and Metro governments, of the LA citizens, and a test of the newly formed inspector general office. Well written and realistic.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book is okay but I thought the movie was much better.  It often seemed to be repetitive at times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|We loved this book. We have read it several times and plan to read it again.<br />Can't wait to start the others again, too.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|I bought this as a gift but it is a great movie.  I was surprised by how good it is.
B00F880BWG|4.0|I love my Walking Dead.<br /><br />This episode was good...but also seemed to meander a bit.  A little less cohesiveness than most of the episodes.<br /><br />Reminds me a bit of early Season 2...setting up the plots and sub-plots for the rest of the season.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am using this app for more than four months and I have found it is beyond my expectations. after using the memory boost my kindle runs as smooth as new. This app is  \\"must have\\" application. I can safely say there is not better app available in this category than this in the market right now.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband and I were not in a bad place when I read this book but I could feel it was changing. After reading this book our relationship is stronger then when we first got together.
1579128955|4.0|i got this book because our school had it at their book fair and it was cheaper on amazon.<br /><br />however, i would have liked to seen a little packing material in the box and not just my book thrown in there with nothing else.<br />the box was bigger than the book and luckily it is not damaged, but it could have easily been.<br />a few balled up pieces of newspaper would have sufficed and kept the book from flopping around during shipping.<br />it did arrive in 2 days so that was good.
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Great album. One of Ray's finest. It's not only a great duet album, but also a nice album to relax to after a long hard day.
B002RKSZKI|5.0|I love this novel.  It is amazing to see how the rich (even in those days) viewed the world, had no worries about their stability, and yet still were threatened with troubles.  I love Emma's development and how she evolves.  And the ending is perfect.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really like this game. It keeps me busy for  a while. I am going to upgrade to the paid version.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Still keeping conflict fresh and characters intriguing. Beautiful as always. That Countess Dowanger keeps it real, yo. Fresh 2 death.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|What a fun game. I spend all my free time playing. Get this game now and never be bored again. I've lost 15 pounds since I downloaded this game. Don't have time to eat. Play all the time.Called in sick to play and write a review about this godsend of a game. Joy joy joy
B005LAIIGM|4.0|Eye popping, groundbreaking space shots. I'll be interested to see how they accomplished some of these scenes, hopefully on DVD. They created a good story to back it up, kind of repetitive at times I thought, not sure I would watch it again for the story, but the visuals are a treat and worth the viewing. It did have tense moments as well which kept me guessing. On a whole, they did great job with the movie. CGI has come a long way and Gravity shows it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The best book l have ever read and l really loved and understood and l read it all the time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Reminds me of some of the stuff I grew up on...Arthur C Clark, C S Lewis' Space Triliogy, etc. good stuff!!
B00F30S0Y0|5.0|I wouldn't say I'm an Arcade Fire fanatic, but even the most casual listener can appreciate the band's rich, methodical approach to music. Needless to say, these guys knock it right out of the park for the fourth time. Reflektor is about as distant from The Suburbs as you can imagine, but it's a lot stronger for it, and they pull it off without forgetting who they are and what they're about. Amazing record.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love the game. Something great to come back to when I've got a few minutes to spare and it's great getting it on my Kindle with the bigger screen.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|...so you know it's not American.  Really, I've just completed the first season of Netflix's HOC, which is palpably inferior to the original's cogent, well-paced narrative, in conjunction with the starker character profiles of Francis and Elizabeth.  However, neither should be exclusive viewing if you like either.  Yet, I shudder to think of the brilliant underlying story diluted through a protracted run as did NBC with &#34;The Office&#34;.  Incidentally, I live in the lower 48./K
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is a page turner. It will keep you engaged and make you experience every possible emotion a human has.
B002N3GD2Q|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal release of shows - great range of sound and strong performances.  Much like the Dead, NYC seemed to inspire great performances!/K<br /><br />P.S.:  Boston, Detroit, and Pittsburgh are must haves as well!
0762451319|5.0|Yep, I just bought this for the necklace. It sits high on my neck, right near my collarbones and looks fantastic. Not heavy enough to hurt my neck but I definitely was aware that I was wearing it all day. The little picture book is cute as well as the little tattoos. The box was crushed but the goods inside were fine.
B004W648Y2|5.0|As a fan of latter day Kinks (sounds like a religious sect) - especially Give The People... - my discovery of VGPS and Arthur has been nothing short of revolutionary for my listening preference with the band.  Both are characterized by a sound, writing style, and simple euphony that bely the vivid story-songs and sharp editorial barbs directed at everything from suburban conformity and crass commercialism to cultural imperialism.  Utterly magnificent; an artistic peak for Ray.  Consider it Primal Kinks./K
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great show! Wonderful characters! Reminds me of one of my favorite shows,'Little House on the prairie'.  There are so many memorable characters and every episode leaves you laughing and crying.. This historical  drama seems realistic to the period and you do get a sense of how difficult and tentative life was. I found myself watching 2 or 3 episodes at a time!! Hooked!
B008IJHIAA|5.0|Okay, like many of you, I own the early catalogue on multiple media (usually vinyl and cd - though with some of you vets I know we can add cassette).  Sonically, I cant' distinguish much difference from previous cd releases, though I maintain that my vinyl remains superior to these &#34;bright&#34; boxes (I have a pretty decent Denon system that gives even compressed sound a chance to shine).<br /><br />THE REASON TO BUY, however, is the addition of live material - in this case, a show from Holland in September '87 that really sparks with not only the most of Document (excepting Strange, Fireplace, and King of Birds), but a great sampling of Murmur, Fables, and LRP./K
B00A81MV3U|5.0|this movie!  It is one of my all time favorites.  Arrived quickly so I could sit right down and watch it.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not at a par with previous Grisham novels. Interesting but not realistic. Too implausable, but typical Grisham. Still I liked it.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This ruined the series.  If you read books 1 & 2 just stop there and make up your own ending!
140006922X|5.0|Brought new meaning to a time 2000 years ago. Pleasantly surprised by author's  knowledge  and writing skill. Good companion for \\"Killing Jesus\\".
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Fun and very addictive.  Was free until half way through then of course you had to purchase so that you could see what happened next.  Was worth the purchase!  Story and graphics are good.  Will definitely purchase more G5 games
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I was so happy to see I could finally get this app on my kindle fire!!! it is my favorite game!!!!! love love love this game!!!! now if we could get words with friends I would be in heaven!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoyed the storyline. Looking forward to the next season. The characters were well developed and plot pulled the viewer into the story as you watched the show. Excellent scripting and costumes.
B0093LINVK|1.0|Bought this and spent a night loading it up and getting win 8.1 loaded. Turned it on the next day and all it wanted to do was reboot.  Went to the fora and they said to upgrade the bios and reseat the memory.  After that it rebooted constantly, or maybe even didn't turn on. Called Intel and they would gladly RMA it.  But after 16hrs of labor for what should have been 2hrs, it just wasn't worth it.  The only good thing was the singing box, and that got annoying after calling their Tech Support :(<br /><br />I hope amazon takes this back no questions asked. By the way, I also had to return the memory and external hard disk because they \\"match\\" the PC.  What a pain.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved this book! Catching up with Danny after all these years was great, but the real story about the gypsy-vampires and Abra was truly mind-bending. This is old-school Stephen King at its best!
B00G32OER4|5.0|This movie was so scary. I loved it. I would recommend those who like these type of movies definitely watch.  I just wish I would have went to the theater to see.
1616551607|5.0|Yoshitaka Amano is my favorite artist!  I had three of his art books already and I had to have this.  The box that holds all three volumes is absolutely beautiful, and of course all the art inside is amazing.  The second volume is by far the biggest of the three, and FFVI is the one most represented.  That worked well for me, because that's my favorite of the series.<br /><br />This is a must-have for any Amano or Final Fantasy fan.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Loved the CD, the music is outstanding, would give it a ten if allowed.  A little disappointed in the DVD, the first few songs are fantastic and the rest is just a fire burning with music playing.  Wish the DVD would have included the guys playing their instruments in front of the fire at least.  Not sure why they felt this was a selling point.  At least with the CD you could watch computer generated graphics.  HOWEVER for listening pleasure it is TOP NOTCH!
B0053O89KG|5.0|We bought this to catch up quickly on the series.  It was a great decision, because my husband and I both just love Nathan Fillion!
B00957T6X6|5.0|I loved Tolkein and this is the new fix. Hard to follow all the characters and their relationships, but somehow it all fits.
B00422LESO|2.0|My friend recommended this book because of the movie coming out, she loved it, unfortunately I was not so blow away.  The characters aren't well developed, the plot drags on, and it almost felt like the author didn't really know how she wanted to end the book, so she just came up with a quick exit even though it made the romantic moment at the end seem very disjointed.
B00F880BWG|5.0|Who would of thought that Carol had the killing spirit in her? It is great to see that Rick is finally awake and not sleep walking around the prison, acting as if all is right with the world and there is no more danger on the other side of the fences. Why, he even has started to wear his Colt again and given Karl back the only defense he has against the brainless, dead horde The whole group has to always remember that the dead fear no evil like the living do, and have nothing to lose in taking a lunch break..
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|I used to pay this a lot on FB with a friend but my computer mouse doesn't work good any more so I am glad I am able to pay on my Kindle now! The only problem I am having is I can't figure out how to pay with my friend through this app. When I go to pay with friends it looks as though I only have the option to invite. I don't see where it shows online friends. This app should b perfect if I could figure this out!
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Great book - fast read, enjoyable characters.  So much like the tv show (or maybe the show is like the novels), whichever way you look at it, if you like mystery/thrillers, you'll like these books by Richard Castle.
B005EHILV4|5.0|This product is great for a simple interface to get your mic or guitar into your DAW software.  I wanted this for constructing songs in Garageband without spending too much.  No noise is introduced to the signal path and on my regular MacBook with 2GB of RAM I have had ZERO latency problems.  Plug and play.  Performs as advertised.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Fast-paced, good story line.  Enjoyed reading this very much, wasn't sure after watching the series on tv, but the books are just as good, if not better.
B00G32TD98|5.0|I wanted to watch the movie since I have met Ed and Lorraine Warren in the past and enjoy their work and their refreshingly open, honest and earnest nature when it comes to the paranormal and the fact that evil does exist in this world.  It was a great movie, creepy, one that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up from time to time, and it made me want to never hear a clapping sound again!<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars for the acting, the story and effects.  I especially loved seeing the real life Lorraine in the midst of a scene at the college.  :D
B009NX1YT6|5.0|good acting and good music a feel good movie of a easy going era an uplifting movie of an jnnocent time I high school life
0736083863|5.0|Great way to workout.By knowing what areas are affected by each moves. Very insightful and very trustworthy. Learn how to void bad pose that can overworked muscles and cause injury.
B00881VLCE|4.0|The music is nice and the photos are pretty. Somehow I lost a piece on the first one but when I restarted it I had them all.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|I read as many as his books as I can, always 5 stars.<br />Luckily I'm retired so I can stay up all night with no one<br />to answer to.  Four in the morning is my bed time any more.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|good. it crashed twice. lost everything the graphicics are excellent. it is very fun.the characters are loveable.'i started over because i love the animals. i think they need to fix the crashing.<br />you can go far without buying. just takes longer but you get there.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. The daily tournament is a great way to get extra closeups. I do wish that you could get more coins playing it. Overall, this is my favorite bingo game.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Nice. Mid size, so not ideal for pituitary giants. Accurate enough. Way cooler than a Casio as a sporty watch you can wear with a T shirt.  Great bargain. Splash proof only. No quality problems in the first week.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a very fun and addictive game.  I play it all the time. It is so much fun when you can hit that bingo button.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Finally available for the kindle. This game is one of the many things that I do to pass time. It's fun &amp; a little challenging.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|It has a few little bugs but other than that it is an excellent application for beginners, wish there were more languages, excellent and free, you want to learn a second or third language, get this, I'm learning German from nothing and I really like this app, and it even reminds you to practice every day
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I had been searching for the mahjong flag tiles game,with no success and always thought that the original game version would be complicated with incomprehensible symbols,but this version  is so clear and the option of music in the background is a bonus
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|A fun game for prehistoric animal lovers of all kinds, as well as anyone who liked Jurassic Park! The selection of species is great, and frequent updates constantly make the game better and better!
B002W7J3SO|5.0|Great movie. I seen this many times before buy it never gets old. One of the great classic movies directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Definitely recommended.
0786838655|4.0|I grew up loving Harry Potter. I was so sad when the series ended. However, because of my 5th grade class who has introduced me to the Percy Jackson series, I decided to try reading one myself. It is a great book! It includes aspects of Greek mythology and is full of adventure. It is a page turner. However, I would still choose to read Harry Potter, but I recommend this book too.
B002JXK5VU|3.0|I love science fiction and I'm willing to suspend my disbelief to a great degree.  However, this show is often ridiculous and written by people who obviously have very little scientific knowledge.  I gave up on it after a few episodes because of that.  Stories need to be plausible to some degree.  These stories often were not.
B00G32QIEG|1.0|So fn bad don't buy don't rent<br />You wil be pissedwhen you see it in your recents<br />Girl friend will hate you
B000GCFG7E|5.0|Like many of Child's Reacher novels a little over the top,but excellent story development & plot twists make this one of his best.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|How do I get the new updates? I can not find were to get them. Help me please! Other than not being able to find were to get the update, it is a great game!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|Epic best game ever plus  you can make your own rocket I recommend this game to people with minds  that like building and strategy
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|All of us avid readers have found at least one book whose words formed a story so great and powerful that it lingered in our minds for weeks - both during and after we've finished reading it. I am proud to say - genuinely - that Doctor Sleep is one of these books.<br /><br />King starts off the story with a mysterious plot, that hooked me from the first words. Unfortunately, I must warn you; there are quite a few scenes in the beginning that are very detailed in terms of sexual harassment. This includes a descriptive scene about child molestation, plus a few more that are slightly less... \\"intimate.\\" This shouldn't be a problem, however, for a mature adult reader. If you've read a couple of King's novels before, it's not much worse.<br /><br />The story continues along an escalating plot that I found quite intriguing; I truly did enjoy Stephen King's creative twists. However, many of the \\"twists\\" were spoiled for me because of my recent reading of \\"the Shining,\\" the prequel to this book. It was obvious that King had tried to relate the two stories (not just in reference to each other), so the book was quite deja vu.<br /><br />On the other hand, King DOES reference the Shining multiple times, and not in great detail. He provides the reader with a sufficient explanation for Dan Torrance's past, but I'd suspect many aspects of Dan's characterization to be confusing to someone who doesn't truly understand his past. Therefore, I highly recommend reading the Shining beforehand, for a more thorough and enjoyable read.<br /><br />Overall, I applaud this story as well as King's apparent knack for telling a story. If you're into mystery, horror, and/or supernatural fiction - this is the book for you!
B002QQ8HAG|5.0|A good documentary about a great woman. It's a good film, I think it could of been better. It does show what really goes on behind the scenes of Vogue.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I never write reviews, but this game was that good. It was completely engaging, relatively challenging, with just enough help available to keep you hooked. Worth the money by a long shot.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Loved it! Action packed! Had me sitting on the edge of my seat waiting to see how it would all unfold.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game.  It's addictive and not boring.  There's always something to work on.  However, I lost everything on the last update and I'm now starting over.  Boo!
B00FOU1O3S|5.0|This game is so much fun! I cant believe it was free. Grafics are superb great game to relax to. Highly reccomend for whole family.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|I thought that all the big names turned in credible performances.  Dustin Hoffman did a superb job of being the down-and-out lawyer.  Dinero was a perfect tough-guy priest.
B0055OK2T0|3.0|This movie tries to be something for everyone.  Romance is entwined in a futuristic thriller.  It's an okay way to spend a few hours.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have used this email site for over 10 years now; however, I do not like it as much since they revised its format.  They tampered with something that was good and did not make it better.
B003XT603Q|4.0|I enjoyed Norwegian Wood though not quite as much as the Wind-up Bird. Really thought that one was outstanding.<br />I'll read more of his works in the future- he is an interesting author.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|enjoy this game very much.  play it everyday and love to have friends to play with me.  it is enjoyable!
B00FPH6AXE|2.0|Could have been much better with Will Smith taking on more film time. Jaden Smith is not ready to carry a film practically by himself.
0140544518|4.0|This book is best suited for older kids...maybe over 5.  I read this to my 3 year old and he was so concerned for the pigs and very upset that the wolf would eat the pigs.  Let's just say it has been very difficult for my husband and I to find a \\"nice\\" way to explain this to our toddler.  This book opens the door to topics I'm not sure a 3 year old is ready for...well, maybe you have a very mature kid.  Whatever the case, be prepared!
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|i think some of the challenges are too rididulous i am about to stop playing wasting all my time on this game .
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|seen where alot of my friends was playing its a good way to pass the time needs more ways where you can earn stuff
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun but too basic.  Add more elements. The game is kinda boring. You need to make it easier yo achieve the tickets for new levels
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Enjoyed this very much and well written. Keeps reminding me of those that have influenced my life. Will be ordering more from this writer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really like this game! It's challenging; however, there's a help screen to bail you out if you get too frustrated. Very hard to stop playing!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I have watched this show from the beginning.  It offers a good story, with lots of action drama and surprize endings.  Can not wait for the next season.
B00479SVBU|3.0|I must say this product would have earned 5 stars had the product been given to me in top condition. The LCD screen was broken and didn't light up like it was suppose to and I contacted the company directly only to receive no response. In any case it still works fairly well and the design is user friendly. My only problem is figuring out how to work it at night...
B0019O6IWU|4.0|I have always worked with the public and find that making people happy can be a true challenge.  I always look for alternatives to communicate with people more clearly.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This has always been a great way to pass the time. I love that you can personalize the game to suit your taste. This app. Is flawless, never any problems with it.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Found a new author.  Love it when she is well worth reading all other books she has written! Will be filling up my Kindle!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very enjoyable game. Have played it on Computer,really like playing it on my Kindle. Lots of features, would recomend<br />the Majong App.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|This book reveals strategies and motivations of the captain of a ship that I never before considered.  The terminology was difficult to understand.  Even with the author's attempts at explaining some of the jargon within the story, some of the details were missed due to unfamiliarity with nautical language.
B00F8MI9NK|4.0|My granddaughter loved it.  It kept here in front of tv .i also thought it was a cute movie. Thank u
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|This book was interesting for 50% of the book.  However the ending was a big let down.  The secret seems unimportant.
0061649694|4.0|It's a good book, good children's story. Like Alice in Wonderland if it was directed by Tobe Hooper. There's something about the &#34;Person falls into Magic World&#34; that's still appealing, and Gaiman's done it thrice now (Coraline for the kids, Mirrormask for the teens, and Neverwhere for the adults). He does a good job of starting out as mundane, moving to whimsical, then eerie, then oh-my-god-I'm-going-to-die-a-horrible-death-if-I-don't-return-to-mundanity. I recommend it. It's plenty short.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Good read. Kind of dark and twisted. But the author is great at this genre. I would read more from her.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I have had this app for about 1 1/2 years.  it was great till new format.  Now it takes about 15-20 ztries to get it yo work .  I wish you would ho back to old version
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Loved this book a lot. It was a little inapropriate but still very,very good. I especially liked the letter in the end that tells about counseler paige. The whole book was very interesting abd I highly reconmend reading it but read the others firdt.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Yes, I like this product. One thing I don't know why I have to try it off if I am not using it. Or, it will not talk to my WiFi after.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved every minute of this book!  For me, it is one of his most satisfying books, a most worthy &#34;sequel&#34; to The Shining.  King seems to be still maturing and expanding, as a person and a writer.  By the way, I have the same reaction to his other new novel, Joyland.
0307271080|4.0|Through Ifemelu's blog and comments, one sees racism through the white people's eyes and through the educated black people's eyes and the juxtaposition of it.  The short stories exposes the flesh and bones of racism.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is almost as good as Salems Lot, King has a real way of getting you evolved with the lives of his characters. In my opinion, this was better than The Shinning.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|Great that this was unearthed. I loved it.  There are a couple of things to keep in mind though.  This is an old film and does show its age. Temper your expectations.  The audio restoration was well done but showed its age as well from time to time.  Remember, the multi tracks are very old.  You can only do so much with it.  There is a moment where this was evident in a bonus audio track.  I believe it was in the last 30 seconds of From Now On.  Either Rick's voice was breaking unnaturally there or it was the tape.  I'm not sure which.  Looking past these few minor quibbles, the whole thing is a very satisfying experience and a must have.  A true holy grail as others have mentioned.  :)<br /><br />Update: I just discovered that my copy does not have DTS 5.1 audio at all.  You press the option for it and all you get is the picture and no sound. I tried on 2 different setups and 2 different machines and got the same result.  Weird but oh well. Everything else is fine though.  At least I got Dolby Digital 5.1.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Review from 10 year old:<br />&#34;OMG! I LOVED it! I even liked the &#34;reunion&#34; of Annabeth and Percy. Rick Riordan needs to keep writing, and, write FASTER.&#34;
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Walking Dead is amazingly well done; one of my favorite series to date.<br />The fact that I can purchase the whole series and download each episode to my TiVo automatically as they are broadcast, makes it that much sweeter... No cable bill!
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Great protection for my Garmin 800. Fits perfectly including the little access covers. Stays in place. Probably will buy a couple more just for some color variation. Recommended!
140006922X|5.0|An excellent and at all times interesting account of the life and times of the historical Jesus Christ. Highly recommended to all readers with even those not of faith.
B001L51RQE|5.0|I am very satisfied with the DVD condition. Also the shipment and the seller. The cd condition was the same as described in the advertise. The music is really fantastic on this DVD. The band played great all through the consert
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|I Love this movie. I could watch it again and again. I am so glad that it's free for prime!  :)
B009NX1YT6|5.0|Love it every time. A great movie.  Great music and the best cast. All the tunes are singable. Try it.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|More action and zombies in this season coupled with what looks like a good season storyline. What more could you ask for in this type of show.
B00G32OER4|1.0|this is kinda cool because I actually live just behind this house (the real house in harrisville, ri) on the powerline grid-<br />my neighbors who own the farm just behind them knew Roger and Carolyn personally- and their little girls. Roger was a salesman and always away from home, carolyn was home with the children- and she was not mentally stable from what I'm told by a couple of neighbors who have lived here the past 50 years. Roger liked his booze- and his wife a dramatic person- the whole family was unstable. I've actually met the contractor who renovated the house and personally know the family who owned all the land next to the perrons land (which is now mostly owned by Rosenfeld concrete- and I bought my land off of tom Schwartz- who owns all the forest on our block (up to the perrons property) and who's ex-wife Pam used to live in the perron house just after they left. Schwartz bought the property off of the Perron family-<br /><br />The movie is 100% pure BS and not based on a single piece of documented evidence-at all! The Perron's are simply tale tellers and the warrens simply live for the fame and never accommodate skeptics. There's so many holes and inconsistancies in every single one of the warren's &quot;cases&quot;- I've read them all. This entire movie is based on nothing but rumor and second hand story tales. There hasn't been a single reported incident in this house since Schwartz bought it and since resold it (hmmmm,wonder why?) This movie is actually pissing all of the neighbors off because of all the people who come and take photos and actually knock on everyone's door to get info about the house- even had the burrillville PD keep people away because it's out of control.<br /><br />It's amazing how eager people are to believe and accept any premise that hint's to an afterlife.<br /><br />that being said- it is somewhat of a scary movie; but unlike real terror movies like the exorcist, the conjuring gets you with the typical new-age horror movie scare tactics with use of loud noises in dark rooms - I enjoyed watching it but there were some pretty big holes in the story, for example- why would a man move his 7 member family into a new-england house in the fall without knowing if the furnace was working? According to the movie- the furnace was located in the &quot;secrete room&quot; that was accidentally found when the girls were playing &quot;clap &amp; seek&quot; in the closet; roger went down into the secrete basement where there was a piano and old furniture, and then found the furnace in the same room, and then told his wife he'd be up in a few minutes, he wanted to try to get the furnace working....??? which means he moved his family into a new-england house just before winter and never thought to ask the sellers where the furnace was- since it was in the &quot;secrete basement?&quot; pretty stupid lapse of logic in the story. Too bad I can't post pics- because I have a few of me riding my bike over that bridge you see in the special features section of the dvd &quot;face to face with terror&quot; that bridge is less then 1000' from my house just through the woods.<br /><br />watch the movie- just take Hollywood's version (and perron's tales) with a huge, HUGE grain of salt and don't believe everything you see on the big screen- even the &quot;based on true events&quot; which is all total bulls[...].<br /><br />I drive past the house every day on the way to / from work- it's a nice house since it was renovated- plenty of new cars in the driveway- certainly doesn't look like anyone is being tortured by demons or ghosts in that house...ie scare tactics with use of loud noises in dark rooms - I enjoyed watching it but there were some pretty big holes in the story, for example- why would a man move his 7 member family into a new-england house in the fall without knowing if the furnace was working?

B0053O89RY|5.0|Just wonderful! The shows get better and better, with more developed characters, like  the Mom and her relationship with her 3 kids and husband--- Happy they realized what a comedic actress she is---so so so so funny!

B0040I09RM|4.0|Hadn't heard much about the show but have really enjoyed it. Great cast, and good mix of story lines. Looking forward to the next season.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|I am addicted to this show, but I have to say, this season was slow. I wish they had just killed of the girl in the first episode.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I first read this book as a boy shortly after it was published. As I near the age of forty I still can't put this book down as I read it yet again. It is as alive to me today as when I first read read it some 27 years ago.
B001O6W9QC|3.0|It was an okay funny movie.  More smiles then laughing. Wouldn't watch it again.  The guys enjoyed it more then the girls.
B00BAXFECK|4.0|Ms. Tart has, no doubt, a masterful command of the English language and an ability to evoke deep emotional responses from her readers. I could not put this book down. I found it intelligent, engrossing and so emotionally engaging, I had to find out what happened next. That said, I ended up feeling quite sad and remorseful for Theo, and most everyone in the story. I finished, thinking I wanted more, and had an unsettling feeling inside. I loved The Secret History, and will read Her other book straight away.
B00G32OER4|5.0|THis movie is soooo scary!! I'm still watching it, and will be most likely getting a movie just lie it again! Lol.
162064309X|5.0|I loved the story and, as is so often the case, the reader's voice sells the whole thing for me. I need to read my pleasure books as books on cd… otherwise I feel like I should be reading for work… this is a book that really was worth it. I enjoyed the slightly dark humor, the international history turns and the fact that the one hundred year old man is still alive and kicking!
B005544TRQ|5.0|The first episode was really good and gets you hooked. Every episode after that has a unique twist and keeps you interested.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|my son read the series and wanted to watch the movie.  he was excited.  it was a fun family night
0307588343|4.0|In light of recent market new highs, I re-read this book last week in order to remind myself of our most recent financial history. Lehman is no longer with us, but the markets current outlook may be reminiscent of real estate madness days gone by. I highly recommend taking a closer look at the momentum that lead to the collapse.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|downloaded for 4 yr old... she lost interest very quickly, it was not what we expected and I believe just a little to involved for her.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Didn't know what I was missing.  All my friends and family play, and I didn't.  Now I started, and I can't stop!  It's addictive, in a good way!
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Watching this with the subtitles creates an extra layer of mystery and surreal distance. When it reached the end I was like, \\"Wait, did I misunderstand that...hold on, I mean...no way!\\" To find out the truth about what happened and why it happened is sick enough, but to be left not knowing if he did the unthinkable or if he did the UNTHINKABLE. It was a lot to take in, for sure. I give the film 5 stars simply because the craftsmanship was undeniably high caliber in every aspect. But in America, films are in a mode of having rape scenes just to fulfill a sort of shock quota. This film goes to another level of depravity altogether.<br /><br />The idea that Spike Lee is directing the new American version of this feels like it should be a rumor and not a fact. I can only assume he took it on out of sheer spite towards Quintin Tarantino (if you don't know, he has been very vocal about apposing Tarantino's representation of African-Americans and use of the N word excessively in his films). I expect Spike to ruin it; I can't imagine why else he would accept the gig, unless they let him change the ending to be less sadistic and twisted. Even if this is rendered as a simple action movie, that still seems out-of-character for Spike; We shall see.
0385350864|5.0|I loved, loved, loved this book!!! I was so happy to finally be re-united with Bridgett Jones. She is as always hilarious, extremely flawed, and just like so many of us &#34;normal&#34; women. Mad About The Boy made me laugh and cry (but mostly laugh). I could not be happier with this latest update to Bridgett's life, I hope this is not the last we hear of her!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This is an interesting game with many hidden components. It takes time but the concept of finding items to continue to next step is interesting.
B002KJX4IE|4.0|Wow that was a blast from the past, and trying to expalin some of the idioms to my 10 year old made it that much more memorable.
B001NY9YJA|1.0|I downloaded the MP3 only to find it doesn't hardly have any sound and when it does, it's very scratchy. I have deleted the album from my computer.
B000JLSM00|5.0|Classic John Wayne movie in Blu-ray.  The print is amazing, will make you think you are back at the theater watching on the big screen.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|I just started watching this series for the first time. It immediately grabbed my attention and interest. I love it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A never before seen look into the actual history and situation on the ground in Palestine during the time of Jesus and the development/marketing of the church in the following centuries.
B0050PLT8W|5.0|Excellent music. Screaming bass guitars, drums that sound like machine guns, and deep voices singing raunchy lyrics. What's not to love?
B004NS710C|3.0|Nice entertainment, a bit slow.  Love both characters and for that...would watch again. Are you kidding about the words? geeze
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am in love with this show! It has a great plot and it always keeps you on your toes!
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Hard to follow, somewhat exciting, lacking any depth. Won't watch again. Characters were good, decent story line, missed on the execution.  Need better writting and directing.
B008IJTFYW|3.0|This wasn't my favorite app. It has tons of options but I couldn't set it to run all night long.  It also doesn't allow you to do anything else while using it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|very challenging. definitely gives you something to do and keeps you thinking. great game! Can get frustrating tho. i love it
B009NX1YT6|4.0|Good clean fun! PG13 for bun in the oven comments. Remember the good ole days for baby boomers. Enjoy it!
B0035HKWM6|5.0|I have always loved this movie ever since I was younger, its one of my great memories.. will never get tired of it
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|No comparison to A Time to Kill. Very slow and predictable. At the end I was hoping for something unexpected. I'm still waiting.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The calculator is fine the GPS Direction however is not I have been unable to open it apparently it stopped downloading
B00ERIUO02|5.0|This product arrived right on time. I gave it to my friends as the birthday present. She was so excited and hugged me. It is definitely a great gift.
0894803123|4.0|This book was given to me several years ago.  I was able to make great ice cream from the beginning and I still refer to it for new ideas, techniques, or for their charts on butter fat content.  Besides ice cream, they also give recipes for sorbets, sundaes, sauces, drinks, and baked goods.<br /><br />Like many reviewers noted, this book calls for the use of raw eggs, but you should use pasteurized eggs or the custard method.  While the custard method is more work it makes an AMAZING difference.  I won’t bother giving directions as several others did this.  The custard method also allows you to use vanilla beans.  Vanilla beans are much better than even the best extract, although it too is more work.  Use one or two beans per quart by slitting the bean lengthwise and scraping the middle (it will look like the middle of a Fig Newton) and steeping it in the cream.  You put the scrapped out pod in also, or better yet put it in sugar to give it a vanilla flavor.  The next time you make ice cream put the old pods from the sugar in the cream and replace it with the new ones.  Don’t buy the vanilla beans from your local mega-mart as they are expensive and usually stale.  You can buy a quarter pound of them from Amazon at a surprisingly cheap price.<br /><br />Another part of the book says to always carefully measure any alcoholic product you add to your ice cream.  Instead, reduce it (boil it down) by half or more.  This will get rid of most, not all, of the alcohol, concentrate the flavor, and eliminate the boozy taste.  I do this with every batch of ice cream I make as it improves the texture of the ice cream.  I use Triple Sec if I don’t want to add any flavoring from the alcohol.<br /><br />The ice cream I make is some of the best I’ve ever had.  Good ice cream shouldn’t be low fat, low calorie, or low anything.  Unless there are health issues don’t skimp out on the heavy cream.  If you are going to go through all of the work to make your own ice cream it should be the best you can possible make, and it will!
1401938906|1.0|With so many positive reviews, I thought for sure this book would make a believer out of me.  Of course I believe my thoughts create my reality to a certain degree, but this book proved nothing.  I did see butterflies on the day I did THAT experiment, but that was the only one that worked.  Don't waste your money.
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|I have watched this movie about three times and I would have to say its one of my all time favorites!  Siu-Wong does a great job in this movie.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This is a very easy read and a good story.  I like how the author melded the different stories together as one in the end.  Good book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't even know how this book made it on to the best seller list or what all the hype is about. It was the worst book I have ever read. It was so poorly written that I didn't want to even finish ready the book. I kept hoping it would get better but never did and if you want to know how it ends you have to read the other two books... which I refuse to do I cannot endure two more books about the same thing over and over.  So PLEASE don't waste your time or money on this book!!!!<br />I would rate it a zero if I could....
B000002UCN|5.0|The songs on this C.D. are my favorite George Harrison written Beatle songs and early post Beatle songs like &#34;My Sweet Lord&#34; and &#34;What is Life&#34; and &#34;Give Me Peace&#34;.If you like George's Beatle songs and his early stuff  you'll enjoy this C.D.
0920668372|5.0|Such a sweet book! This will become a cherished book to pass along throughout generations.this will quickly become a favorite.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Closure on what happened to Danny 'Doc' Torrance for sure.  Now we have new ones we'll think of!!!  I have to admit that this is the very first Stephen King book I've actually read.  I'm a huge movie fan and the 'Shinning' is one of my favorites.  I did find out some new things about the original book that differed from the movie.................wow.  I had already discovered some differences when I visited the actual, sort of 'Overlook'.  I won't give a thing away but want to say......................it's so worth the read.
B007Q476KU|5.0|Looking for a date movie? Looking to score with a country chick who loves horses? Say no more. War Horse is your movie.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|While I have a smart TV, they don't include all broadcasts to watch later, so this device is very easy to set up and cast to your tV with any computer with Chrome.  The quality is very good.  On occassion I had to restart because of lip sync (annoying).  For the price it is well worth it and I look forward as they add new apps to this device.
B0063IH60K|5.0|GREAT GAME. I REALLY LIKE THE RANDOM DEALS. THE CARDS ARE EASY TO SEE AND EASY TO MOVE. THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF SCREEN ADJUSTMENTS ARE ALSO HEPLFUL.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Classic King. A great read and an engrossing story!  What a great way to revisit The Shining. Thanks, Mr. King!
B008KYOCA2|4.0|I love this calendar.  I would add some Icons (dr, denist). And be able to delete one event in a list,
B00FWPWNKS|4.0|Fun fun but watch out.... very addicting. App freezes up occasionally but overall enjoyable. Now there is a second addition after completing the first 100 games. Enjoy!
B004RCUJ9E|5.0|My grand children love playing this game. Either by themselves or with me. Because it forces captures it teaches the children how to play. I can not just let them win.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is just what it says. It has different scenes and can last you a while. Nice time filler.
B008Y7FQ6E|4.0|Tommy Lee Jones gave a good performance in this move. It had a good plot line and easy to follow.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a stunning introduction to a dark confining world. Mr Howey sets out to show us a world confined underground and ruled by fear. The characters and their dark spiraling living quarters take you by the hand and guide you into their world. This is a marvelous epic tale in the sci-fi world. You must read this series!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I liked the book but too many medical facts . A lot of the information I skipped over because  it was way over my head.
B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|I watch this movie when I want to feel encouraged that white collar crooks get caught.  I also collect Michael Douglas movies.
B0098QAAAC|4.0|Such a beautifully tragic movie. Grab your Kleenex and a blanket and settle in to watch!<br /><br />The acting is well done, and the scenery and locations are stunning.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Having a great time with the book.  John Corey has a wonderful sense of humor<br />and I like the relationship with his wife.
B00943SQCI|2.0|I thought something would happen and nothing did. No action. A few &#34;cute&#34; moments but overall pretty boring and predictable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game it is very addictive. Can't stop playing this game.<br />I would recommend this to anybody who likes to play with candy
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train is actually the story about two women who were raised in foster families. Vivian is in her 90's and was actually sent west on an orphan train after being orphaned when she was a young child. Molly is in foster care going from home to home. She is looking forward to turning 18 and aging out of foster care.<br />Their paths cross when Molly gets a job helping Vivian go through all her old boxes in her attic to help her weed out things to keep or throw out. As they work emptying the boxes, they learn about each other's lives. Molly uses her computer knowledge to Google some names from Vivian's past and surprises her with  information about people dear to Vivian.<br />I had known about orphan trains, but this story so clearly points out the horrors as well as the good that might befall a child shuttled from home to home. I really appreciate the way the author compared the two eras: the orphan trains of the past and child services of today.<br />It was a wonderful story and truly warmed my heart.
B005V5WBFG|3.0|It was a very good security but can't afford it right now<br />I would recommend this security to anybody who needs it.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Great show. Runs smoothly on amazon prime.  Amazon had Fringe before Netflix and In HD well. I appreciate that. Cool.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I recently read this book in class and I lost it. But I loved it so much I bought it on the kindle instead! There are quite a few plot twists and shocking near the end. I didn't get the ending but it was great nonetheless
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|James Paul McCartney out does artist half his age! He's a living mozart and no one will ever top him or the Beatles! This Album is fun, catchy and it grows on you very quickly! It sounds so relevent yet takes you on his personel journey through the past and present! I love it and so will you! Way to go Macca!
0553381687|1.0|Personally I[[ASIN:1423121368 The Demon King (A Seven Realms Novel)]] thought this was a horrible book. I would not recommend it. the shipping was very fast and the book was in excellent condition but the story is very poorly written and difficult to follow as it jumps around a lot. Further the characters are give outrageously weird names and there are so many that it is difficult to keep track. For a better story to those who like this genre try Cindia Williams Chima's Seven Realms series.
B00EO1VFU0|5.0|Everything was what was advertised for the product. I received all of the faces listed, everything was in top quality when I received it. all of the accessories attached well to the main body. There is somewhat of a learning curve for getting the figurine to stand and balance with different poses, but the included stand helps tremendously with that. Great Product.
0920668372|1.0|I dislike the product as I was told that I could order the exact book that I was looking for and obtain it within two to three business days if I'd pay extra.  Since I the gift was for a baby show and the shower has come and pasted the book never did get to the intended receiver.  I have yet to hear anything from the company explaining why I do not have my order in hand nor have they even tried to make any amends to the problems. When I order other items on line I have swift and accurate delivery with little to no problems with the products and this is what disturbs me.  I trusted this company with a precious gift and they did not deliver.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It was a good book but after the first 2, I was disappointed. The hunger games is still a great series.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|the pages of this book reak with the sameness over and over again until boredom sets in.  I would not recommend it to any normal person or I should say sane reader.  To think there are more of these rags boggles the mind.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Chromecast is a great tool to broadcast HDMI wirelessly. It would have a nice 5 stars if they would add more compatible apps.
0345529057|5.0|I loved the show so had to get the books, and it was worth it. I am only through the first book and<br />find myself literally laughing out loud at some of the stuff the midget says. Also, there is a ton of back story<br />on the bastard Jon Snow that you do not find out in the show.
B00FWPWNKS|5.0|Like this game a lot it sounds like a simple game but watch out You need to do some thinking
B008Q0AP2E|4.0|Not a bad movie for a rainy day with a bottle of wine and a warm blanket to share with someone.
B0045HCJT4|1.0|I've read some of the other reviews & it makes me wonder if anyone of them have ever seen the original movie format?<br />For me, it was dissappointing to say the least. The scenes were out of sequence, some omitted, others put together in ways not previously intended, therefore changing & diminishing the original impact of what was once a truly outstanding piece of cinematic art.<br />Kurt Russell would dissown this particular offering. Whom ever edited  this committed an act of vandalism.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Loved the film, love the DVD. Despite Russel Crowe's questionable singing, it is most enjoyable, and pretty faithful to the original show.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|Fun addictive for ages 8-100 in my opinion it has little Gore and by far best gymnastics game ever played
076781326X|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film was available on DVD. It came out when I was a little kid, so it was a nice trip down memory lane. The songs (by Lionel Bart) are rather simplistic, but they are catchy. Not sure that I would have cast Mark Lester in the lead, as he was very soft-spoken and &#34;wispy looking&#34;. But he is 45 years older now, so that is a moot point!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am loving this show. Going to get all the way caught up to the current season. Marathons in my future!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Should a well written story of an orphan put on a train from New York to Minnesota. Heart stopping tragedy to heart warming tears. A girl who loves through what most could never bare. A women who lives a rich life only after suffering as a child.  Makes you appreciate what y oh have.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|When I tell u this game is off the chain. This  game uses your brain not just a glimpse.It may be hard and easy but I love it.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Wow! such a simple game with just enough smarts needed to finish each level. Very fun for kids and adults.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play this when not doing anything else at work. It's fun to play. Sometimes I play the game at home.
B003D1N1HC|4.0|I have to say if u want to see ritchie blackmore at his finest check out the title track bc he is in excellent form and BTW don airey has amazing keyboard solo on this track as well ..this band never disappoints and this album is no exception..
0321934318|4.0|The reason that I didn't give this book 5 stars is not because of the content, but because of the paper stock.  Normally, I wouldn't notice this detail, but the paper looks as though it was exposed to moisture.  Not like it got wet, but just damp.  Also, the stock is thin, which may be part of the problem.<br /><br />The content is nicely structured and answers most of the questions I have about Lightroom.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Love it<br />Hard to us and not very helpful have not been able to use it yet the camera is very dark and don't k or if there is a flash
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This story is hard to read and gives you a very heavy heart, but it is a tribute to all those involved in Devgru and their true love of our Country. Loved Adams story and the strength he had till the end. Love to his beautiful family who never gave up on him.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|Love the different soundscapes on this album. It's got me addicted! I love the journey Capital Cities takes me on!
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|I have somewhat &#34;indifferent&#34; feelings about this album.  I suppose the area I can point to first is the sound.  It's obvious that the band is heavily influenced by Metallica, ACDC, and Guns N' Roses.  I love those bands too, but I don't like how similar, in my opinion the best songs on this album, sound to songs from the aforementioned bands.  A7X adds their own &#34;twist&#34;, but I still feel that it isn't THEIR sound.  'Shepherd of Fire' is a great song, and I think it represents the Avenged sound more than the rest of the album.<br /><br />Secondly, the album seems a bit &#34;front-loaded&#34;.  The first half of the album is essentially what makes up the best parts of the album, after that it somewhat falls off.  Ironically, the first half is the most heavily influenced by other bands.  I'm obviously nit-picking here.  It's rare that any album is really good from front to back.  'Kill 'em All', 'Appetite for Destruction', and 'Dr. Feelgood' are the only ones that come to mind at this moment.  It would just be nice if bands spread out the singles, because I think it makes the other songs seem better than what they are.<br /><br />I love Avenged Sevenfold and respect the decisions they made when creating this album.  I was in attendance at Joe Louis Arena, when they made a stop in Detroit on their 'Hail to the King Tour'.  The show was absolutely amazing and I look forward to seeing them again.  I bought this album and Nightmare as well, and will continue to support this band in the future.  I am definitely looking forward to the next album, and hoping us fans can get A7X atop the Billboard 200 for a third straight time.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|It's one great Alarm clock that wakes you up GENTLY, NOT LIKE the old alarms that made you jump from the Shrill sound of the early style alarm.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am only 3 episodes into the 4th season and it has gotten off to a fantastic start.  Hope the rest of the season goes as well.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|If you love A7x, this is a must have item! The show was awesome, and it was nice to hear what could have been on their self-titled album. The covers were nice. In a nutshell, great buy.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|DragonVale is a new addiction. I just can't wait each time the dragons breed to find out what new dragon is created! SO FUN!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|There is no explanation of the &#34;Power-ups&#34;, or how, or why they work!! But, I do find the game fun and addictive!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|My kids loved the video last year and now love the game.  Just silly fun for young children to play.
B00C4QLUFM|5.0|I am a true romantic and enjoy comedies as well. This is a great movie with two great actors in it. Julia Roberts and Richard Gere do an excellent job in this movie
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Every so often a series captures the attention of the viewing public with quality writing, suspenseful storytelling, and acting prowess.  This is one of those times...
B00F0AI9Y4|5.0|I wasn't expecting a lot of this album, just maybe one or two songs like levels, turns out the entire album is like when Moby first hit the scene. Fantastic song after another. Perfected mixes. Its like Avicii was saving all his good stuff for this album and I hope the next one is more of this excellent work.
B0094K1K8I|1.0|This is obviously fake, and very slow.  Even if it were real it would be boring because it shows so much dead time, just panning a room with a camera.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|LOVE IT!!!  What a great show!  I am transported every time I watch it!  I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good new series.
006202406X|5.0|I loved this book.  I'm an adult, and am not in a position to recommend books to 15 year olds.  I think my (adult) perspective, combined with the fact that I know life just doesn't turn out how you want or think it should (for good or bad)shielded me from having negative feelings towards the book. I read that the YA rule of leaving the reader with hope was violated.  I didn't have that expectation that this book would provide me with overwhelming hope at the end, but it's not like it left you hopeless!  People just want to be critical.  I think the book provides adequate resolution for the surviving characters and is well paced and well written.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great Series! My All Time Favorite!  Really Loved IT.<br /><br />The Cast is excellent and I cannot stop watching!<br /><br />Highly Highly Recommend!

1449305172|5.0|This book is a great intro into getting a business started and conducting your customer development.  There is in depth and actionable advice on how to conduct interviews and demos with your customer and the types of information that is best going to help you get to product/market fit.

B009NPA3MS|5.0|I have been a fan since he first auditioned on American Idol, saw him in concert this summer with John Mayer and can't say enough great things about this rising star.  Love the album and can't wait for the next one!
0425263916|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but I look forward to finishing it and reading the upcoming books.  Although I love the &#34;Fifty Shades of Gray&#34; trilogy, this is far better written.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|I love everything about this film.  It can be enjoyed by adults and children.  The uniqueness of the presentation and animation set this apart from any other film of its kind.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|Just another game that they enjoy for a bit while trying to figure out the ins and outs of it..
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|The Arctic Monkeys are a solid band and over the years have produced some quality songs.  This album finally brings it all together and creates a unique sound that I enjoyed a great deal.  From the fast paced songs to the slower jams, it shows a lot of versatility.  Buy it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My kids love this.. I am not very good at.. keeps them occupied.. wish it took used more of their brainpower
0307279189|5.0|This is by far my favourite book ever. Honestly could not put this book tho. So good I have and still recommend this to everybody and and anyone who runs.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This is classic Stephen King reminiscent of The Stand. Any King fan will enjoy it. It's not necessary to have read or seem the Shining, but you will want to once you have read Dr. Sleep.
B00EHMG358|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Preston & Child's wonderful literary character Agent Pendergast.  Amazon wisely gave a taste of the story to kindle readers at no cost and I can say that I am anxious to get my hand on this book as soon as it is released.  If the rest of the book is as exciting as the first 9 chapters of this newest novel ...then sign me up to purchase the book.  Another amazing book from the dynamic duo - Preston & Child.  If you're a fan ...don't hesitate to pick up this book as soon as it's released on Amazon ...you won't be dissatisfied and you won't regret it.
B002WYJHBA|5.0|Amazing film for the price. I grew up loving this film. Once I found it in blu-ray it was a must buy.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Just when you think that writers eventually top off on their writing ...along comes the original master of suspense and horror - the great Stephen King.  Doctor Sleep is the story of what happened to Danny Torrence (from the Shining) as an adult and his adventures with handling his special gift and the meeting of someone even more talented ...with both of them facing a new enemy.  The story is exciting and of course is going to be another classic.  In my humble opinion ...Stephen King is one of those rare writers that keeps us on the edge of our seats and waiting anxiously for his next book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game; so much fun! The only bad part is I want to play all the time. The graphics are fun and the voice that narrates the game is simply entertaining.
B001F6TXME|3.0|I purchased this to use with my Nikon D90 for night photography / extended exposures.  The switch works fine when triggering for a single exposure on any shutter speed except bulb.  The latch/lock for holding the button down while taking a picture with the bulb setting is a little sticky, not a smooth movement and the release is not much better.  I ended up transitioning to software control of my camera while doing night photography. However, I still have to use the bulb setting for exposures greater than 30 seconds.  The latch really isn't an issue seeing as I open the shutter and leave it open for an extended time.  So, it's not like I have to use it 30 to 40 times in an hour.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|My most favorite show. The fourth season was great and as always the writing was unpredictable. The ending was a big surprise.<br />Love it.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I am very happy that I can finally play this game on my kindle.  Very challenging and addictive. I love it.
B00B4FU6KE|4.0|This is one of those books that informs without seeming didactic, mainly because it is so well written.  Fowler surprises us and draws us into her characters' world to examine issues that I had not thought about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am very happy that I can finally play this game on my kindle.  Very challenging and addictive. I love it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Lot's of great acting, honor, ups and down's, English aggravation and stubbornness. Lot's of high's and low's to keep you hooked.
B00F91G5BS|3.0|Most people that dislike the movie dislike it because it was nothing like the book.  I have not read the book so I can judge it simply as a movie.  In that sense it was ok.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Lot's of great acting, honor, ups and down's, English aggravation and stubbornness. Watching the difference between the have's and have not's and what they fret over is enjoyable in some way.
B000002O5L|4.0|Good Songs, Good quality.Classic Tom Petty. Only negative: Case was cracked in the back. I can live wit that, though.
B000FC1MCS|2.0|I didn't care for this book. I didn't like the writing style. The story wasn't bad and I think I might have enjoyed it more if it were written in narrative. But in the first person of an autistic 15 year old it was, for lack if a better word annoying.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|\\"Remote\\" is a  career-changing read for any modern knowledge worker. Remote work, once a pipe dream, is now a realistic career option.  You can make the money you need and the difference you aspire to make -- while living where you want to live, actually seeing your family, and never commuting again.<br /><br />This book is the most coherent argument for remote work I've seen, and the most practical guide to getting a remote career off the ground and living up to its promise.<br /><br />We all feel it, don't we? Being together in a shared, physical workplace every moment of our working life is, professionally, both unnecessary and even counterproductive at times. When you factor in the personal toll (grinding daily commutes, time away from loved ones, etc.), inevitably you start asking, \\"Why the hell am I doing this?\\"<br /><br />\\"Remote\\" takes that question as far as it can go, unpacking it into short essays that dismantle so many of our basic assumptions about work. And then, it poses another question: \\"If not 'this,' then what else?\\"<br /><br />The \\"what else\\" is working remotely, and that too is unpacked. How do you do it? What if my boss doesn't trust me? Won't I be cut out of major decisions, alienated from my peers, even just plain lonely? And what about the work: don't we need the \\"bandwidth\\" that comes with frequent face time to get important things done? How will the creativity happen? The special, impromptu moments around the water cooler?<br /><br />\\"Remote\\" does a great job of addressing all those things and more. The end result is a sort of career guide for meaningful, dignified modern work. Remote work is not a panacea, it will not solve every work problem ever identified, and it will pose challenges of its own. But it will change your career -- and in so doing, perhaps even your life -- and this is the book that will show you how.<br /><br />(If you're interested, my longer review of the book: [...]

1451666179|5.0|Thing 1. I never buy paper books anymore. I am 110% into my Nexus and it's e-reader apps.<br /><br />Thing 2. I bought this book. As much as I love my Nexus, you can't lend e-books to people that don't have e-readers and I plan on lending this book to PLENTY of people because Allie is awesome and amazing and the entire world deserves to be enlightened by her insights.<br /><br />Thing 3. This book far surpassed what I was hoping it would be and if for some silly reason you're on the fence about buying it you should get off the fence and do it.

B00005N6KG|2.0|Bought a pair six months ago for my wife, and wanted another pair for myself.  I wanted something lightweight and over the head for running.  These headphones are very comfortable while wearing a beanie.  The sound quality is what you would expect from an earpiece this size  it's not spectacular, but the primary requirement for me was a headphone to stay in place during a workout which these do.  I was quite surprised when i saw the headphones I purchased recently for $10 jump to $50.  I assume if you are looking at this you are similar to me and considering a workout headphone, and for the abuse the headphone of the such receive I cannot recommend this product for this price.
B0083ZBW2Y|1.0|This was a very interesting book to read and violent but awesome too it should be rated 5 stars<br />WAY TO GO BUCK I LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0061122416|1.0|The Alchemist contains many commonplace, even some what hackneyed, ideas about life, while doing nothing to expand upon them. Although Coelho's attempt to convey changing one's life as an alchemist can change ordinary metal into gold is somewhat original, he drastically fails to make it anything more than a very briefly alluded to concept. Otherwise every other somewhat original idea he presents is too mystical and too irrational to even be accepted as truth, such as his ridiculous notion of a \\"Personal Legend\\" motivated by the \\"Soul of the Universe\\". Rather than The Alchemist conveying any true wisdom, it feels as if it is Coelho's dumping ground of his underdeveloped musings on life.  Although he does attempt to provide a new insight into life with each new person Santiago meets, he should instead had each person teach Santiago a completely different lesson regarding different aspects of life. Then these lessons could have all merged to create something vaguely resembling an epiphany. Instead, Coelho tried to make every new companion relate to an overlying \\"soul of the universe\\" theory. This approach was rather boring and caused the book to become rather redundant.

0553582011|4.0|I think the title of this review says it all. It seems like Mr. Martin has no problem with having no cast of characters left by the end of this series. And, speaking of the end, that may not come in his lifetime, or mine for that matter. The length of time between volumes is getting further and further apart. One needs to peruse the previous volume to remember what happened before starting on the next book. Lastly, I wish the material was less adult oriented. It is an amazing fantasy world, filled with excellent characterizations. But, it is also excessive in sensual and adult oriented themes. I much prefer Tolkien's moral compass to Martin's.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|loads of fun.I have been waiting a long time for this game. very addictive and passes the time quickly. thanks.
B00DG292SK|4.0|GREAT READ!!!!!!  GREAT BEHIND THE SCENES INFO.  INTERESTING NEW INFORMATION ABOUT SOME OF THE<br />WHO'S  GREAT RECORDS. TOWNSEND OPENS UP FOR A NOTHING LEFT BEHIND BOOK. AS A TOWNSEND FAN I FOUND<br />THE BOOK HARD TO PUT DOWN.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Dr. Who may not be everybody's cup of tea, but it delivers interesting and fun stories throughout the season. The series mixes episodic and serial elements and can be a little campy, but that is part of the fun.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|As I installed this app as one of my firsts I have no idea if my battery lasted longer before it was installed. Have just read a couple of reviews which imply it is itself a power eater. Compared to my little grey screened, read only, Kindle my Kindle Fire HD uses far more power BUT it is in colour, I use it for far more, (more like a mini laptop) whereas my original Kindle is just for reading, so the two are not comparable. It tells me all I need to know about the state of my K.F. HD but if I ever have time and can mirror the state of play exactly, I might be able to reach a reasoned decision. In the mean time it does what I want so I shall continue being told everything needed to know about my battery in clearly understandable ways. I have given it 5 stars for ease of use. 5 stars for clarity and attractive presentation. Am no longer certain there is no downside, but neither am I certain there is.
B004RKXNDU|2.0|This tale is very disappointing. Although Le Carré is much touted as an insider to the international intelligence community, his stories can be written by any author that reads the newspapers. Ed Spievack, author of &#34;Memoirs of an Unfinished Generation.&#34;
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|As an already avid reader of Hyperbole and a Half, I knew I had to have this.  And it didn't come at a better time.  Crappy day at work?  Read a story and laugh til you cry.  Failed a test?  Read a story, cheer up, and go study.  Allie Brosh is great, honest, earnest, and funny as heck.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|An interesting follow up to a King classic. I was a little worried about reading this as &#34;The Shining&#34; along with &#34;The Stand&#34; are amoung my favorites from King and I was afraid he would somehow mess with the original story. No worries though, no part of the original book has been revised here. In fact, you could easily read this book without reading the Shining at all. For a King novel, this one feels particularly short. I read it in two days. I have to wonder of someone didn't over edit the book. It's not like King to just skip over decades of time. We see almost nothing of period just after the events at the Outlook and very little of the remainder of Dan's childhood. Overall, I enjoyed it. I hope King revisits the idea of the &#34;True Knot&#34; type characters in a later book. Seems like fertal territory for him.

B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Wanted to see for a while now, so I rented on Amazon. Overall it was worth watching, but not spectacular. There was no real character development, except in the end with the twist. Even then, it was pretty much on the surface.<br /><br />Worth watching, but not great - glad I waited to rent.

B00B8BR1YS|4.0|This is a story of how William Shakespeare might have come to write Romeo and Juliet, a romantic tragedy and one his first plays not to be based on actual historical persons. The backstory is that men, by tradition, had always and by law, played the female roles, which provide some humorous visuals in this movie; but a young woman, posing as a man, broke this barrier, playing the role of Juliet. Queen Elizabeth, herself a theater patron, attended that premier, and along with everyone else, was greatly moved by the production, and when she learned that Juliet was indeed played by a woman, that gender barrier was broken forever, when Elizabeth herself states that she “knows something of a woman playing a man’s role.”  It’s a sweet motion picture and a good look at the days of Shakespeare’s Globe Theater.
B0055S348W|4.0|Had trouble with this because it didn't have a driver for my new HP LaserJet color multifunction printer.  The generic driver it recommended I use didn't work.  Through trail and error with various drivers from similar HP machines, I finally found one that worked.  Now I'm getting great results - sharp and clear in either color or black and white.  The printing function is available from all application programs and the internet.  It gives you a chance to preview the pages in your document and to print out all of it or just certain pages.
B00BIPCY14|4.0|Great show. Good to watch where you. An rewind to catch every minute or say did I really hear that.
B00BXDOSXS|4.0|It works very well, but it took awhile for it to find my videos.  I had to play around with my Kindle Fire HD until I figured out where the videos I had saved from e-mail attachments had been stored, but once I found them the HD Video Player did too and there was no more trouble.  The HD Video Player immediately put links to the videos on its home page so I could now find them at any time and play them when I wanted.  It will not play the videos directly from an e-mail attachment; you have to first save the videos on the Kindle Fire HD.  The playback is clear and sharp with good audio.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I love the game but it won't load my facebook profile/info. I've tried at least a dozen times, even thought I'm already signed into facebook, I sign in again and it fails every time. =(
B00BD99JMW|5.0|At first I wasn't going to read allegiant just because of some of the reviews and yes, I did read the spoilers. After I found out Tris dies I was so heartbroken that I was going to just leave the series at insurgent where I knew she was alive lol but I still had questions that needed answers. Allegiant WAS a great book despite the awful reviews! Of course I would have loved for Tris an Tobias to have a happily ever after, but she died for a good cause. (I remember reading a review that says she dies for no reason, NOT TRUE!) So yes, Tris dies. But she goes out in the good ol' Tris fashion that we all love her for.<br /><br />After reading Allegiant I was sad, yes, but mostly because it was over. I felt a sense of peace because for a lot of people in the book it was a happily ever after:)<br /><br />IF YOU LOVED DIVERGENT AND INSURGENT (like I did) PLEASE READ ALLEGIANT! Don't listen to the bad reviews, judge it for yourself!
0061733199|5.0|We saw this book on a TV show and found that it gives every bit of useful information as promised.  My husband is just reading it for the second time - but hoping we'll never have to apply what we've learned!
1452110581|5.0|Very cute book. This will make a nice Christmas gift for any cat lover. The book is very funny, the concept is cute but unlike a lot of 'humor' books it does carry through to the end. Good price for a small gift or stocking stuffer.

0545615402|5.0|The quality of the books is wonderful. They come in a nice box case. Fun reads if you are a Harry Potter fan. If you're like me you'll never get your fix of  the wonderful  wizarding world of Harry Potter, but these help stretch the series a bit further!
006202406X|1.0|I think the author ended it like this so that it would put her in the spotlight.<br />She did not care about the fans that have made her rich by buying her books. By ending it the way she did I believe she thinks it will make her more controversial,  talked about more.<br />I guess the old saying is true, it doesn't matter what people are saying about you as long as they spell your name right.<br />Save your money, don't buy Veronica Roth's books
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and sometimes challenging. Is a little short,but it says more rooms are coming soon. Not bad.
B00FFRAKRG|5.0|I swear, this is so good. This band has gotten better since it's founding. Korn has defined a sound, unique to them and whatever side projects each of the members have. This album gives the &#34;originalist&#34; Korn fans some beef while serving up a whole new platter of new tastes.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this version of Mahjong and gave it 5 stars.  I looked at and tried several different versions of Mahjong but found this one to have more intensity of the game than the others.  The others also were too easy.  This one is more exhilarating than the others.  When they made the Deluxe HD then that made it even better!  If anyone likes to play Mahjong then they need to get this one.  I think you will love it as much do.<br /><br />l
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I have loved the game on Facebook and glad it is now available for my Kindle. But the same thing that drove me crazy on Facebook drives me crazy now.....only 5 lives at a time unless you pay. I would rather buy the game then be nickel and dimed to death!! And what happens to all those life's and turns we give to friends....and vice versa ???
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I have been a King fan from Carrie.  If I could have given 3.75 stars I would have.  He's finally back to pretty much the old Stephen King, but I have enjoyed many of his previous books even more.  I would definitely recommend and have recommended this to, especially, Stephen King fans.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Great affordable way to watch netflix and Google Play with friends. I only wish that google would continue to roll out support for the rest of its applications, (media stored in drive, etc). Excited for Pandora Radio and other third party clients to begin using the hardware. Super easy to use and much cheaper than the alternatives.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game to make your mind working..fun, a little challenging , wish there was more levels, but not too hard.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This is a cool running game where you grab as many coins to earn new powers so that you can get farther along the path
B00DVKOYBM|5.0|EASY pool game making the best shots of my life!Highly recommend this game for poor playing pool players.It can make you a pro!
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite movies. I am not a horror film buff but I love the scenes of San Francisco and Paris. Was good to see at this time of year.<br /><br />Fatimaseyes@aol.com
B007L3BMGA|2.0|Was interested and couldn't put it down for the first 120 pages and than lost interest and haven't read any for 3 weeks
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Counter to my initial expectations, the book did not provide &#34;iconic image&#34;, but sounded rather fair about different sides of the complex personality. The best part for me was an effect that reading had by promoting a lot of thinking about the &#34;bigger picture&#34;.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|If you like fighting games you must get this it's so awesome you can even make<br />Your own robot !
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I was impressed. The game presents challenges that require that you THINK. the graphics are awesome and what they achieved getting you into the Room was marvelous. Only let down was when I reached the Epilogue and somehow I find myself stuck.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|It's great fun to see Dame Helen Mirren handle an automatic rifle.....  to watch John Malkovich play crazy...  Bruce Willis is at his most charming, and Morgan Freeman is (as always) solid....  If you can stand a few &#34;blow em up&#34; sequences and a lot of violence (which is half serious, half parody) you'll thoroughly enjoy this and its &#34;feel good&#34; ending.
B00G32OER4|4.0|I rented this one at the recommendation of a friend during my &#34;Halloween movie-fest&#34; tradition. Let's face it: haunted houses have been done to death (bah-dum-CHING), so it would have to take a recommendation for me to view it. The story, as most in this genre do, introduces the family to their new home and lets them get moved in before anything happens. The first thing I liked about this one was that things started to happen pretty quickly, after their first night there actually. At the same time that we are getting to know the family, we are also introduced to the Warrens...a couple who are somewhat famous paranormal investigators. That added another level of interest to the story-line. Without wanting to give too much away, there were several occurrences that had me jumping, and several times that I wanted to fast-forward a little (I call this my litmus test...if I get nervous about what might happen and want to speed it up so I don't get too scared). I did have some of my usual thoughts during horror movies (the way the walls always look dirty in these movies and why wouldn't someone paint them before moving in; I would totally not stay in a house that my animal didn't want to go into; after you know something scary is going on, why would you go take a nap by yourself in another room far, far away). But nothing kept me from getting into the movie, getting scared, and enjoying it. The movie moved along at a nice pace and I would definitely recommend it.
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|With NEW, Paul McCartney has become NEW and relevant again.  This is his best work musically, and more importantly, lyrically in decades!  Instead of bowing to the wishes of a plastic,aging pop idol who tends to over-think things, the various producers on this album seem to have challenged McCartney to channel his Beatle and pre-Beatle roots.  The result, while maybe not a \\"masterpiece\\" by definition, is a fun, album that almost any track could be played today on the radio and still sound relevant and NEW.  It's the first McCartney album I will keep in my collection in years and I actually found myself singing along out loud with Alligator the other day.  Paul truly has become NEW again- and it is a pleasant surprise to this aging fan who thought McCartney's legend was safely tucked away in the past!
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|it is probably just me, but I found this game very uninteresting and will probably uninstall it on my tablet. It makes me feel terrible and I just don't like the feeling it makes me have. Games are suppose to be enjoyable and challenging. But this one makes me feel sad and terrible.
B00F30S0Y0|2.0|Reflektor is not a terrible album, but it is not a masterpiece either.  Seems Arcade Fire, having had a taste of fame, have decided to do what a lot of bands in their position do- experiment.  I for one am not too keen in the direction this album travels as it seems that their musical influences have taken over rather than defining their own unique sound, which is why I originally fell in love with the group.  It almost sounds like they are trying to BE Talking Heads, but like I said in my review title, David Byrne's Jacket doesn't fit.  It just doesn't work-Dare I say, sometimes they even sound a bit like Spandau Ballet!<br /> Hey. I hope you had fun with your two disc set of experimentation, but please for the next album,  BE ARCADE FIRE!
B00BEU3NI6|5.0|yes, i had played this on my daughter's tablet and looked for it immediately upon getting my tablet. So, my enjoyment of my own could be enjoyed and I am now trying to beat my daughter in how high she has gotten
B00E9P959O|5.0|The remix is a vast improvement over the original mix. If you like the original songs, you will love this version for its clarity and energy. Musically, greater texture can be heard. Almost every song comes out better in the new mix. A highlight is an added guitar solo on Ceiling Unlimited. I would highly recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|to find that this was finally available for my tablet. I play it frequently on Facebook and could not stand that I could not enjoy it on my tablet. Thankfully Amazon got this one right on and I immediately upon finding it had to have it
B008Q08IV4|5.0|best movie ever made! I have seen it many times and love it more each time. The story line is exceptional.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Pusheen is so cute and humorous. I love how I can see characteristics of myself and my own cat in Pusheen.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|The results I had with Pam Grout's thought experiments were a real eye-opener.<br />In the first experiment I asked to be shown something that would prove my thoughts have control. I did so, and that night I had a dream, and while I usually don't remember dreams, the next day this dream was sill with me. In it, my wife and I went skiing - downhill snow skiing - in Hawaii. Snow in Hawaii? For some reason during the dream I was obsessed with finding a sign post showing the altitude of the mountain. The sign said \\"Altitude 13,796 feet.\\"<br /><br />The next day I did a Google search for \\"ski Hawaii.\\" How silly is that?<br />What I found is there is skiing on the top of the volcano which has an altitude of 13,796 feet. Whoa, where did that come from?<br /><br />Another experiment said to think of a friend, someone you have not heard from in some time and visualize that friend calling you. So I visualized a particular friend calling me. We had not talked in months. Three days later he called me and said, \\"I was thinking about calling you Saturday, but got side-tracked.\\" It was on Saturday I did the visualization!<br /><br />The third one was to visualize something unusual. So I visualized a purple, spiked, Mohawk haircut. Those haven't been around for years. The next day, I watched a video about how to do some task in Photoshop. The photograph the \\"instructor\\" was using for the demonstration was an image of 4 guys. One of the guys in the photo was wearing his hair in a spiked Mohawk. You guessed it, the guy's hair was purple!<br /><br />Yes, this stuff works.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|Lifelong or even recently-acquired fans of this supergroup should not be considered as such until they have seen this video. In fairness, best also to look online for differing opinions, such as from Don Felder...) and make up your own minds, but it is still a great insight.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|The best book I have read in quite a while.  Quick read but very enjoyable.  Highly recommend this to all parents with children in middle school.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|Rankin in fine form. I hope rebus gets back in to Borders and Lothian police force. Too goof a character to loose.
B005544V6A|5.0|This show is not your typical lawyer show.  It is witty and creative with a little humor.  When I watch this show, I am always amazed at the perspective and creativity.  The hour really goes by fast!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Not sure what happened here as the cast is packed with talent that just ends up being wasted.<br />I don't blame any of the actor's performances here but movie falls flat mostly due to tired tropes and bland writing.  I'm sure visually in theaters the effects may have seemed magical but at home even on a reasonably large screen I was left feeling &#34;Meh&#34; overall.  I don't regret renting it once, but I don't plan on watching it again.  If I could use something other than Stars to rate this I would call it &#34;An Airplane Movie.&#34;
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|The obviousness of the corruption and Chiklis' sometimes over-the-top portrayal of a crooked cop are okay, but not compelling. I watch episodes when nothing else catches my interest.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|For those already familiar with GRRM's work in Game of Thrones and Wild Cards you know the caliber of writing provided by the author.  Great Science Fiction with hints of light philosophy are expertly interwoven with bits of action and suspense.  My only complaint(it's minor) is that the book feels short.  It's essentially chopped up into a few different encounters which I felt didn't allow sufficient time to explore the various themes GRRM brings up in each conflict.<br /><br />To quote CJA over @ i09 -<br />&#34;Martin published Tuf Voyaging back in 1986, but it's actually a fix-up of seven stories and novellas that were mostly published in Analog Magazine throughout the early 1980s. And it's a very different sort of book than Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, although there's still plenty of the hallmarks of Martin's wit and clever world-building. Tuf Voyaging is funny and mostly pretty cheerful, although it takes a somewhat darker turn towards the end that might catch you off guard. It's actually somewhat reminiscent of the Harry Harrison at his best — a jaunty, slightly barbed story of space adventure.&#34;<br /><br />Bottom Line:  HEY GRRM WHEN CAN I EXPECT MORE?  SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!! :)
006202406X|3.0|Many spoilers here.  I am saddened and relieved the book is read.  There was some good and some really bad.  Many others have written about this far more eloquently.  But none-the-less here is my list.<br /><br />GOOD<br />1. Tris stayed Tris.  Got to hand it to Roth, she didn't corrupt her character and turn her into a jerk like Thomas in Maze Runner Series.<br />2. Tobias and Tris worked through their issues by accepting good and bad in each other.<br />3. Evelyn said yes, she would give up her fight and choose her son and I cried.<br />4. They win in the end.  For all the characters struggle they emerge better people and fight for a better world.<br />5. Some good points of tension leading up to pivotal events.<br />6. Tris forgives her brother, sacrifices herself for the right reason, survives death serum to be able to complete the mission.<br /><br />BAD<br />1. Couldn't tell which chapter was Tris and which was Tobias.  Had to keep going back.<br />2. Couldn't stand the lack of action or suspense.  Too much he said, she said, how I'm feeling now.<br />3. Minimized the drama of Chicago so much they didn't even care what was happening, when before in Insurgent it was plot twists, action, betrayal.  Now the whole city is blah.<br />4. Half way in I was debating being done with the book because it was so boring.<br />5. Marcus just let it all slip away from him and he didn't get death in the end?  Really?<br />6. Who were the soldiers that the fringe were afraid of would take them?<br /><br />PERHAPS THE WORST<br />1. Factions are just away to get people to behave in a certain way.  And they can be done away with in the end.<br />2. Divergent, the most powerful theme of the first two books, turns out to be just a genetic thing that really doesn't matter until procreation or simulation time.<br />3. Tris dies and gives her life in the ultimate sacrifice.  Too easy?  Could have made her crippled or made life hard for her and Tobias.  But still given a happy ending.
B001NLL93W|4.0|I loved it. The movie was not nearly as good it did it not do the great character development that the book has.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|It allows  you  to get right to the site without having to type and click anything. It lets you get right where you want to be. Looking for the products and bidding or purchasing what you want.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had read it decades ago but not the rest of the series. I can't wait to see the movie but I know it will be hard to beat the book.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Really well done hidden object game. Only wish they would show you where everything was if you fail the level. I might have closure issues. Overall it is great. Beautiful graphics, fun puzzles...although I'm not a fan of the Blocks puzzle. The blocks don't move very well. Give it a try!
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I bought mine from Ross store for 24 dollars. I don't like or trust  things I seen on tv but I was looking for something  for my hardwood floors.  would give it 5 stars but it doesn't pick up things like paper that's bigger than a  quarter.
0066621003|5.0|This should be required reading for all business leaders.  Jim Collins research in this quick read is just invaluable.  I would read it again and again!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|We already know the critics admiration for this show.  We are thoroughly enjoying the series with its great writing, character development and extremely good acting.
0385349947|5.0|This book changed my life.  Kudos to Sheryl.  The book was an easy read and so inspiring.  I found myself nodding my head in agreement through most of it and it empowered me to go out on a limb and try things I would have otherwise been too afraid to do!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Very sturdy blade construction.  Sharp and usable right out of the box....that said I'd have to say that the sheath design leaves something to be desired.  I bought an alternative sheath off of EBAY that works fantastic.
B001EBYMAI|5.0|My type of movie good and evil, angels vs devil. I have watched many times. Great cast and story. Watch it
B005K8QIS0|5.0|this is intoxicating tv. Jason Isaacs makes this look and sound like a documentary/someone following a real guy around thru his life- he just inhabits his character in everything he does.  and Edinborough  is a great location to film. they should have made about 10 years of this series!
B0089XH38M|4.0|we instaled this protection on two phones and think it works great.  We enjoy most of the products that we get from amazon.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is the best series that I have seen in a while.  It is good for the entire family.  I enjoyed it throughly.
B00CIP57Z8|5.0|Great writing, acting and directing.<br />A love lost, a life in auto-pilot, a chance to live again.<br />Fantastic film for sure.
B00CH87HF4|3.0|I just started this game and haven't had to buy anything. Be careful with health potions, if you don't want to spend real money. Instead, go back and get more xp and loot.  I never liked Xbox style games, but this one is cool. Hubby is hoping I will graduate to Xbox soon, but I love my dungeons!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|It is awesome to use.  Makes notes available from anywhere.  Computer&hellip;tablet&hellip;phone&hellip;even the Kindle!  Comes in handy.  Especially the grocery list. :)
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is fun.  Its great to practice visual tracking and keep your mind sharp all while having fun.  There are goals and missions which are motivating as well.
B000GWE44U|1.0|The rental was for 24 hrs., no it's not free on amazon prime. The movie took forever to buffer or download so I was never able to watch the entire movie. It was not my internet connection that caused the issue. I wonder how many other people have this problem.
B004Q3NBXU|5.0|This was by far the best movie that this guy has done. It was so serious and he played his part to the tee. The suspense and ending surprised the hell out of me........ Awesome
B00BV5FVR0|4.0|If you liked Oryx and Crake, and The Year of the Flood, then you will probably like this. It once again tells the story of Glenn, Toby, Zeb and Adam, God's Gardeners and the Crakers, but this time mostly from the point of view of Zeb, and with more of a focus on how the Crakers and the remaining God's Gardeners are going to manage to live, and live together.<br />It's a more positive book overall, and has a pretty optimistic ending, so it's not as hard a read as the first books in the series were for some people (personally, I enjoyed them a lot, but I know quite a few people who found them too dark).<br />It was great to find out more about Zeb and Toby, who were intriguing characters in the second book. Across the three books, I really  liked putting all the characters and incidents together through the three books, as the history was retold each time from different points of view.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very addictive. Love the game. Great to play with friends. Totally awesome. Great colors. Can play on laptops, cellphone, kindle .
B00ER23UYA|3.0|This Cd is mediocre at best.  One or two good songs, but not as good as Bible Belt.  The recording, as they all are today and have been for over the last 10 years, is way too loud.  Go to this site and watch this video about dynamic range. [ [...] ] It's really a shame that the recording industry puts out these poor sounding cd's with horrible dynamic range.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|First, I was expecting this to be terrible based on the reviews when it came out, but it hardly deserves the negative press it got.  The obvious question is, how good or bad is Jaden Smith?  My take is that he's bad at the beginning when he's doing a voiceover and when he's portraying a cocky recruit trying to make it to Ranger status.  He just doesn't have any charisma or believability in that mode - at least in this movie.<br /><br />But in the latter 2/3 when he's the scared kid who needs his dad, I think he's actually really good, if not great.  He's not old enough to just go it alone, but he's old enough to accomplish a lot and I think he portrays his fear and vulnerability very effectively.<br /><br />Will Smith, on the other hand, shows the charisma of a huge movie star, and it's nice to see him taking a very different tone with this role.  He's a strict military father, and I feel he does a good job with it.<br /><br />The overall premise is decent, the special effects are very good, and though the outcome is predictable it's mostly worthwhile.  Now, the arc of Jaden's acting takes a nosedive (a bit, anyway) at the end when he...I'll try not to spoil it, but really this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone...when he reaches his desired Zen-like state while battling the big monster.  It comes too quick and doesn't necessarily feel &#34;earned&#34;, but then again we all knew it was coming.<br /><br />This is a decent sci-fi flick and worth a rental at the very least.  Go in with moderate expectations and I think most people will be satisfied unless you're very picky.  But I love blockbuster scifi and I generally cut films like this some slack if the overall spectacle is good enough, and this one is.  If we're picking plots apart, this one is no more trite or ridiculous than Avatar.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Like all my friends have this app so I was like, carp, why don't I get the app?  Turns out, it IS totally amazing!
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|The book was very slow to start, and before it really picked up I could guess the &#34;secret.&#34; Once it picked up it was hard to put down. Good book!
0385351399|1.0|I was disappointed with this book.<br />The author is of great repute ,and I think that The Circle is at best a 100 page tale spread out<br />boringly over 491 pages.<br /><br />Examples of computer/control/misuse seemed endless.<br /><br />After about 30 examples of what the Company was doing, I got it!<br /><br />Too much sameness becomes very dull.<br /><br />The ending is telegraphed to the reader about halfway through.<br /><br />I am sorry, but I did not like this book at all.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This book had me glued. It was very different from anything I'd read in a long time. There is a great story here. Stick with it to the end!,
0345803485|3.0|but after all the hoopla I had to read it to see what it was all about, still not my cup of tea.
B008602KQI|4.0|Recommend watching, thought it was very well constructed and had continuity throughout the movie.  Glad I watched it can't wait for the next in the series.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is the best book I've read on the Lean Startup methodology because of the way it ties theory to tactics. Ash does a great job of explaining the overall Lean Startup framework, but more importantly, provides tactical examples of how to apply the framework in the real world. The checklists / forms for things like how to conduct a customer interview are worth the price of the book alone because of the time they can save you. Furthermore, these forms can be easily adapted to businesses that are not web startups since we have used them for developing new products at our manufacturing business. I highly recommend the book and have given it to several colleagues who were interested in startups as a good framework evaluating their entrepreneurial ideas.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|I have watched all of the transformers movies thus far and I think the special effects are awesome.  Great movie for a lazy day.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is an excellent legal series. It keeps you on the edge of your seat and excited for the next episode.
0142501123|5.0|A super cute story with a perfect sing-song rhythm that makes it a pleasure to read.  The pictures are adorable and interesting enough to keep a curious 2 year old engaged. Love, love, love!
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|Not believable. Not entertaining. Surprised at the reviews. That's one of the measures I read before considering buying a book.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|Quell Memento is a beautiful follow-up of the first two games. Gameplay is easy to understand and the levels are challenging without being utterly frustrating. Don't get me wrong! These levels will certainly test you, and may be frustrating for people with less patience than I have, but if you keep in mind that it is not entirely necessary to get perfect moves on each level, then you should be fine.<br /><br />My only complaint is that now that I am going through the levels again to get all the jewels, time pieces, and perfect moves, the game is not saving my progress. It will remember the jewels and time pieces, but my gold checkmarks go back to silver if I exit the game and come back. This makes it very difficult to remember which levels I've gotten perfect moves on, which is rather frustrating, and makes me wonder if I will actually get that achievement when I get to the end :/<br /><br />Still, that is a small thing. I still think this game deserves five stars!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Born to Run weaves together a great story that touches upon many of the themes and ideas that runner's value. While I can see anyone enjoying the book for its narrative, I really see runners, whether they be road runners or trail runners, or barefoot runners or not, enjoying it most, due to its relevance and ability to capture the trials and accomplishments running can offer. In a world where running books tend to be dominated by accounts of the overly competitive and unbelievably successful, with too much time spent detailing times, splits, and paces, Born to Run provides an excellent balance between details and narrative. Many of the individuals described are superstars of the ultra-marathoning world, but they never seem unapproachable, rather the book grounds them in a way that inspires each of us to strive towards our own personal best.
0316055433|2.0|Not surprisingly, The Goldfinch is a complex read. Donna Tartt is a masterful, keenly sensitive writer whose command of structure and language are formidable. I began reading the novel with great anticipation, as I had so much enjoyed The Secret History years ago. So it's with some regret that I write how devastated I was by her protagonist's descent into drug addiction and despair. Hundreds of pages of painstakingly detailed passages about neglect, self-destruction, faithlessness, nihilism, betrayal, and depression were for me unredeemed by the flickers of Theo's wonder at the meaning of life at the end of the book. In my view, Tartt took an enchanting premise (young boy in possession of great work of art amidst personal calamity) and failed to explore its potential in satisfying ways. I expect a great book to break my heart. This book broke my heart gratuitously, self-indulgently, the various loves muted beneath her exquisite portrayal of hopelessness. It is confusing to love sentences, pages, entire sections for their breathtaking beauty (and I did find myself breathing shallowly) and be angry at the unremitting sadness that sustains the narrative. I had planned to read The Little Friend before attending a reading by Tartt next week. Now I'm thinking I'll rest and recover...
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|The premiere of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D was surrounded by a lot of hype, and while the show is interesting enough, it does not live up to expectations. Yes, it's great that the MCU has crossed over onto the small screen and the shared universe continues to expand, but rather than doing this in a way that adds more depth to the Marvel universe, it instead uses one-liners and throw-away pieces of dialogue that reference the movies to demonstrate its connection. The show's biggest issue is that it refuses to take the necessary risks to become a show truly worth tuning into each week; but if you're a fan of the Marvel canon, the show is entertaining enough to check out how the non-super powered individuals deal with the events surrounding the Marvel movies.
B00260GLBO|5.0|Some of their trucks are a little more flimsy than others (probably on account of their being exact replicas). Some of ours don't hold up as well as the Cat trucks (the bulldozer, crane, skid steer etc) but this one looks pretty sturdy. The frame of the dumper is just skinny plastic. I feel like one too many throws in the toy bin and one might snap. Which sucks because that's a part you can't replace.<br />I will say, I bought a few replacement parts for other Bruder trucks through their website and they were reasonably priced, the site was easy to use and they arrived quickly. That made me want to keep buying their products.
B007SGM084|5.0|A love story about true, unconditional love as it unfolds from the first desirous look to  total acceptance...a real page turner...not for the faint of heart...
B00BAXFECK|5.0|ELEVEN YEARS!! It's been so long.<br />She has an effortless way of pulling an awkward character through their story at a clip that Stephen King has too. I love her protagonists. You never feel like you can identify with them but you root for them all the same and understand them. Secret History sucked all the air out of the room when I read it. This one's the same way. I loved The Little Friend too, I know not everyone did.<br />All I know is, I've been trying to replace her while she's been gone and I never could. And she doesn't disappoint this time either.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Does not connect to router signal.  I tried over & over again & it still would not connect.  Very disappointed.
B009WUBERW|4.0|It's a great action flick! Of your hoping for so e great story line though you'll be sadly disappointed though.

B00FI7XBIS|1.0|I gave it one star because there wasn't anything lower that I could use. Need a number of negative stars.
B00CWV8X04|3.0|Very good thriller but not completely surprising or original. It is also an apt critique of the present state of psychiatric<br />medications and great actors to watch.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|not overly easy or hard but challenging enough for entertainment. i would recommend it to anyone with time to spare.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Hard to believe a fellow is the icons years has still got it like Buddy does. This is full of energy and the playing is phenominal. Truly a must have if you are a Buddy or a blues fan! As always, Buddy does not disappoint!
B00FSBW2L6|5.0|The Black Eagle Inn is a heart-warming yet tragic saga of a seemingly regular German family and their individual struggles with the many momentous changes that transpire in their beloved country. The farm house, the Inn and the attached properties serve as an excellent backdrop. The period spans the Great War (World War One) and the tumultuous nineteen sixties and seventies, through the nineteen nineties. The challenges for the Hinterberger family members are especially acute in light of Germany's unique pariah status with the rest of the world during the first half of the twentieth century.<br />Mr. Fischer skilfully presents each character as individually relatable and sympathetic, even as they are observed in their moments of underhanded scheming, family political jostling (as observed between Markus and Lukas) and extreme fanaticism (as seen with Hans-Ulrich and Magdalena). The author also painstakingly humanises the consequences faced by each character as they are pushed to make difficult moral and social choices--which often compel them to reanalyse long cherished beliefs, against the backdrop of an ever increasingly secularised German society. Mr. Fischer also cleverly intertwines the political and religious upheaval being faced by the country as a whole as it struggles to redefine itself--and distance itself from the painful memories of two tragic wars.<br />The Black Eagle Inn is a wonderfully written historical novel, and a book I would recommend for its fictional quality and priceless historical value. 5-Stars!!
B00CFYAT6O|4.0|Maybe not quite as good in my opinion as Revelator but what do I know! This is still an awsome album and I am glad they seem to be moving forward with this (TTB) project. I am a fan of them (Susan and Derek) individually but together they make an even better sound! On this album they seem to have gone back to their own sounds and brought them together and mixed a solid sound. Good stuff!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Jessica Lange gives a power house performance and the conflict between her character and Sarah Paulson's makes for great tv. I like this season better than Murder House.
B00DB2JQ7W|5.0|Nothing short of the best they've done yet. I really liked the whole concept of another album with the guest artists. Some of the songs seem like the guest was in mind when the song was written. Funny little tragedy could have easily been written by Elvis! Been a Mule fan for years and this one is solid!
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|I played this with my five year old nephew.  We really had fun.  It was simple enough for him to understand and I had fun playing with him.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been trying yo fey this game for so long and get book advice or not the actual game and you finialy got it!!  This game is so popular and addicting.  I have other games lathing the same Colorado or blocks but this is the one that I am very glad I finialy got
B000HL2J0G|5.0|I loved MacGyver back in the day and rewatching it now was fun.  I enjoy seeing him figure how to solve a problem with the things around.  It is a clean show you can watch with anyone and not feel embarrassed.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Intelligent and well written. Enjoy the consistency of the characters, and the mystery around the cases. Kalinda is the best- and those boots!!!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|I could never get signed on to my account and the display was not very &#34;mobile&#34; looking.  Maybe just my phone but it was a regret downloading it.
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|This book was very different from the usual novel and many parts of it I liked such as the warm, fuzzy ending.  I did find some of the chapters hard to identify (far better if they had each been named for the person discussed).  Also, I found the parents a bit too &#34;goody-goody&#34;.  It did not seem realistic to have no issues regarding such a seriously handicapped child
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Great for all matrix fans. They are awesome movies if you haven't seen them. The cinematography is way ahead of its time and story is legendary.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Birthday present for 3 yr old grandaughter.  She just loved the movie.  She has walked around singing the music all the time.  She even makes faces of the charaters in the moves.  She is very visual.  Great movie for all.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Very happy satisfied with this app is one of the best people should try this app is very good is goods
B008JFUR10|1.0|half way through this you will be complaining, you'll probably turn it off before the end.<br />I don't believe the 4 star rating on amazon and I don't believe the good ratings on Rotten Tomatoes,<br />There is no way anyone walked out of the theater saying they like it. Sorry folks but when you spend<br />200 million to make a movie you can afford to buy some reviews and they did.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|This is a very good app also people should try it out it is just like the other one I just gave you a better
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Totally addicting.  Sometimes extremely frustrating when you're stuck on one puzzle for a long time - for days at a time!  But you can't resist going back and trying again.
B00979JSZ8|5.0|I really loved the Christmas special of downton abbey xxx it was excellent to watch I rate a 5 star
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khalid Hosseini writes a story that compels the reader to keep reading, following to the end. The end makes you wish it could have gone on longer. As in his other books, the story takes place in the Middle East, but also expands to the US. Khaled manages to bring together both cultures in such a way that it is easier to understand each other. In this case of &#34;and the Mountains Echoed,&#34; he also introduces a little bit of France to stir the pot a little. I tried to read this novel a little at a time to savor the tale, but in the end, I could no longer hold back and raced to the conclusion. separation during childhood, separation through dementia and stroke: there are many ways to be separated from our loved ones.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I totally thought it was gonna be, like. A cheap knock-off version or something. Or at least that it'd show up in crappy condition. But everything turned out great! So yeah. Pretty satisfied.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|Too much CGI. Was disappointed with the acting, it all was a bit overdone and underdeveloped.  Sorry I expected so much.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This whole series really grasped my attention from the first page of Divergent, I felt the excitement, fear, anger, joy, love, guilt and even the sadness that the characters all went through. I even cried through the last few chapters of Allegiant. I couldn't put it down. I'm looking forward to starting the series over and over, one of the best series I've ever read. I've been recommending it to everyone I work with.
B00B2QA9TI|4.0|This was good.  It is the type of movie you should watch on a rainy lazy Sunday.  Characters were complex and brooding.  The scene change and Stage Type Scenes were engaging.  Liked this movie.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book it was easy to read and quite a different storyline. Not your typical predictable story. I enjoyed seeing the world from such a completely different point of view.  Social etiquette really can be a minefield to trip through for some people.
B00G32TD98|4.0|I enjoyed this movie and give it four out of five stars for its genre. Scary enough to be worth watching.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Works good on my android  cleans cache closes all running  apps speeds up memory  you can uninstall and remove apps from device
B00G32VYDG|3.0|This movie was OK and I give it three of five stars for its genre. Funny enough to kill two hours.
0312944098|1.0|I decided to try this type genre again.  Gave up many years ago because all these type novels seemed the same.<br />Nothing has changed.
