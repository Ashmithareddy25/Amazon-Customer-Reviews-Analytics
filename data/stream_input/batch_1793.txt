1601254679|5.0|Being a long-time GM for my group of gamers, this book has made my life SO MUCH SIMPLER.  I'm good at thinking on my feet and I try to be prepared for anything, but we all know that sometimes players wander off the path you expect, and sometimes you just need a NPC friend or enemy to throw into the mix.  This book makes the games easier to keep organized and fantastically more appropriate to the situation.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Pazio has been improving their way of organizing information and it shows in their latest book.  They used the same structure that was well received in the Ultimate Equipment book.  The info on the edge of the page makes it incredibly easy to flip through this book and find what you need without resorting to the index or the table of contents.  I don't spend any time looking for specific page numbers.<br /><br />The NPC's are limited to the core rulebook, but that also keeps things simple.  Anything I need to know about one of the pre-generated NPC I know exactly which book to look in.  Especially with spell lists, that's important as i don't want to search through 3-4 books to look for a spell listed on this NPC.  And on that subject...<br /><br />Spell lists for the caster classes!  I can create a NPC in about 5 minutes at this point, having done so dozens of times, but one area I always struggled with were spells.  I don't always remember which spells are for which classes and generally don't want to take more time while players are waiting on me just so I have a good selection.  Because of that, my NPC casters in the past have been pretty generic and run-of-the-mill.  Not so with this book, they have pre-selected spells that make sense and are powerful.<br /><br />Tactics sections for the NPC's.  This is a nice cheatsheet for the GM (or whoever is controlling them) that gives them an idea of how the character was intended on being played, and what items/spells/effects would be going on at the start of most combat.  This makes playing them on the fly much easier because you already have an idea of what to do.<br /><br />Excellent print quality and a sturdy feel to the book.  A few books in the recent past have not impressed me with the quality of the paper and binding of the books.  It seems they have gone back to a better printer because the book feels more like the original core rulebook in terms of quality.<br /><br />Items come pre-selected for the NPCs, making it an easy loot table if you wanted it to go that way.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Limited to the core rulebook.  I know I already mentioned this makes it easier, but at the same time a few of the books really add to some classes, maybe most notably caster classes.  I look forward to a sequel to this.<br /><br />I would have liked if they had provided some base \\"boss\\" type NPC's, things purposefully rule-bending in order to really up the difficulty.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />If you are the GM, get this book, you'll enjoy it.  If you are a player, you could get this book still to have a good basis for quickly creating characters in the future.  The builds do make for a nice template if you wanted to use it that way, but overall the value to the typical player is probably limited.g them on the fly much easier because you already have an idea of what to do.<br /><br />Excellent print quality and a sturdy feel to the book.

B000067QMD|2.0|It's weird, but with some bottles they work and with others not. It's really a pity because the price is fair.
B005SAJRV0|5.0|I did not start watching this show until the 5th season. Caught it in reruns on tv one day when there was nothing else to watch.<br />Needless to say I am happy I did, this show had me rotf. This show is so good, that I had to buy all the seasons on amazon prime instant video, including future episodes automatically,
B00000EH6T|5.0|great for the rocky fans espicially me rocky 4 is one of my favorite movies of all time no micheal bay film can compete
B005Z28M58|5.0|On my Christmas list there's someone who always wants the latest season of this on DVD.  This is the last year I'll be able to satisfy that Christmas wish.
B004G6009U|4.0|This is a great movie for the feminist mother of a burgeoning young feminist. Rapunzel, though frightened of the outside world is both determined and centered. Good role model for the most part. One of the better Disney princesses.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I just love the way they twisted the fairy tales. It makes it so we never know exactly whats going to happen next. Thumbs up for this thrilling new TV Series. I love it!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This book is fantastic and deserves all the praise and awards (Pulitzer for Lit.) that has rained down upon it. My sole issue with this book is the title. It's awful. I almost didn't read it because the title was so bad. Blargh!<br /><br />Anyway, the book itself is fabulous. Disappointment, demise, desperation, and ultimately - in some cases - redemption. All tied together ala Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon. (Hm. We're all connected in our desperation somehow and glean whatever small amounts of redemption we can from one another??) Another book I would love to read with a group of people led by a trained literari (is that a word? You get my point.)<br /><br />Read it. All of you.
0547884591|5.0|Tim has always inspired me.  Read it and you won't be disappointed, though I did enjoy 4hww better the 4hc has its perks and is still full of great life lessons.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Really liked the It's Time single from this album and the previews from Amazon so I bought it.  One of the best albums I've owned. You can listen to every song and really enjoy it!
B0092S4WLY|5.0|but it needs more floors!  Hopefully it will update soon so I can play more!  Is it going to update soon?
0446580848|2.0|I look forward to a new release from DeMille; I'm a big fan.  But this is my least favorite of all his that I've read, and I've read all but one. Previously I thought the hero, Corey was humorus and quick, but in this book DeMille went far overboard with all the smart remarks and quips, and it got tedious and annoying.  The book is easily 100 pages too long.  The plot is so simplistic as to be laughable--if tracking down terrorists was so easy, there wouldn't be any.  And of course, most terrorist hunters drag their wives with them into the hinterlands of Yemen,right? Hundreds of pages end in about 10 pages of unbelieveable semi-action.  It's as if DeMille realized his printer was about out of ink so he should wrap it up quickly to avoid a trip to Staples.<br /><br />Your money is not spent well on the purchase of this book.  Sorry, Nelson.
B003TOMAPC|1.0|A movie that attracts the attention of young people and then has bad language coming out of the mouth of a small girl with her &#34;Daddy&#34; approving.  People just laugh themselves all the way to hell.  We shut it off when we realized that this cute story line was riddled with strong language, sexual insinuations with children and a little girl committing mass murder.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|This movie is mesmerizing.  The music is classic Whitney at her finest.  The pairing of Whitney and Kevin was so tender and moving.  The movie gets me diving for the kleenex every time...
B008XG1X18|5.0|i am on pinterest at least arn hour a day. i love the kindle fire app. i am on here more than facebook.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|As always, Jackl Reacher is my hero.  A good, exciting read! I love all the Jack Reacher books and look forward to the movie coming out soon.  Although I like Tom Cruise, he's way too small to play Reacher who we all know is 6'5&#34;.

B00AAQVSDW|5.0|Every song is wonderful. I keep listening over and over to it. My two year old daughter loves it too!
B004NELBPC|5.0|Granted, the publishers veer to the left, but I think the reporting is pretty balanced.  Also, they report stories that the &#34;Main Stream Media&#34; doesn't report.  The articles, for the most part, are very well written.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|One of my all time fave albums and truly one of their best albums ever made! I had this album before, someone I knew scratched it up and I just scrapped it, most of the songs wouldn't play so I had to jump on this!
B007FG9LIE|4.0|If you love suspense thrillers you will really like this.  This one is a bit different.  It has many twists and turns and I am 3/4 of the way there.  I still don't know what the ending will be and that is why I love this so far!
B009E3EWPI|5.0|This group will always be a classic rock band.  It was great to see this performance and I will be able view it over and over again.
1439152802|1.0|It held my interest with the mystery ,twists . turns  and surprises.  Liked the character development and would recommend to friends.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The book was overall one that I liked but I was disappointed wondering why the racketeer was spending so much time and money attempting to trick one ex-prisonmate. The reason came out at the end but you don't find out until you are near the end why.
B005LAJ16I|4.0|This was a Christmas present for my husband. We had heard so many of our friends rave about how great this show was and and did not disappoint.

B008QTVNUI|5.0|This is a high suspense show. I cannot wait until this seconds season. I would say it's a better version of 24

0547884591|5.0|This is such a great book.  I can't put it down.  I am a cook and trainer, but recently I have been unmotivated to cook at home due to the fact that I'm cooking all day at work.  This book brought all that joy of cooking out of me again.  I'm also trying to learn Japanese and Spanish.  The idea of Meta learning is so fascinating to me.  I just want to eat up all the information I can related to it.  Thanks Tim for such a wonderful read.  I agree, you should have started with this book.
B005YPJ31I|5.0|The movie \\"Lincoln\\" is described as having been taken from or inspired by this book. It is an excellent book, and to take nothing away from the book, I can't find more than about five pages (out of 754) that relate directly to the movie at all. The drama of the passage of the 13th Amendment is summed up in about four flat paragraphs in this book. Nothing of Thaddeus Stevens. Or the capering connivers Lincoln and Seward supposedly hired to buy votes. So don't buy the book to relive the excellent movie. Or vice versa. The author deserves the awards and plaudits for this wonderfully researched book. She notes that she spent more than a decade on it. That said, a couple of things could have been handled differently. I think the book could have been about 100 pages shorter if the author had left out everything about Kate Chase. The book did not need a single word about Salmon Chase's daughter and her lovely long neck. Likewise, about Mrs. Lincoln's shopping trips, and what she bought (especially if you don't say anything about Stevens' congressional investigations of her spending - which the author doesn't; it's like a joke setup with no punchline). And Frances Seward's various ailments, real or imagined. Edward Bates' wife seems to have had a real effect on the discharge of his duties, and the outcome of his political biography - yet almost nothing is said of her. The same could hardly be said about page after page of trivial details about Kate Chase and Frances Seward.<br />Couldn't we have had a few words about Lincoln's vice presidents? Even if it was how little they mattered. I think they mattered much more than the book reveals. How were they chosen to join him on the ticket? The startling fact that Lincoln never met his vice president until after the election? Whether, with all the concern about the President's safety, anyone ever expressed an opinion about the readiness, or lack thereof, of either of Lincoln's Vice Presidents to assume the Presidency? This seemslike a serious omission (both on the author's part, as well as the Lincoln Administration's if this was truly so overlooked). So does the fact that at the Chicago convention, when Lincoln was chosen as the Republican nominee, William Henry Seward's people turned down an offer for him to be Lincoln's running mate - also not mentioned in this book. Nor, I believe, was there due examination of the speculation in 1864, when Hannibal Hamlin was being replaced (and why, exactly was he replaced?), that Seward could have been named Lincoln's running mate - in which case Seward would have finally become President. What a missed opportunity for the nation that was. How different history might have been.<br />A salient point was also missed, I believe, in failing to extrapolate that Lincoln's assassin John Wilkes Booth probably did more harm to his beloved Confederacy than any man in history - certainly more than the man who was the object of his misguided assassination. A few words would have also been welcome on the outcome of the manhunt Edwin Stanton initiated to find Booth and his conspirators. Or U.S. Grant's later significance.<br />And although we did have a complete rundown on Kate Chase's final denouement, not a word about whatever happened to Robert Lincoln? Not even that he became a cabinet secretary himself, and was also present at the assassinations of James Garfield and James McKinley? Or that Edwin Booth once saved Robert Lincoln's life?<br />At least I give the book credit for motivating me to look up in Wikipedia those questions I felt the book left unanswered.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I love this show.  It's entertaining and great to relax and watch other people fight now and then.  Fun Times!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was fun energetic and sad. My favorite part was when the senior citizens where attracted to Greg. I hope you guys have the same feeling of this book like me. :) :)
B00AH8VU0Y|5.0|I read the comic books right about the start or mid season of two. I enjoyed the comic as well as the show but one thing I found lacking was the fact that the show didn't get into the entire Woodbury segment.<br /><br />For those that didn't read the comic, I won't spoil it for you, but overall when Rick and the group discovered Woodbury it became shocking. The Govenor in the show is merely the kindergartner's version of the Governor of the comics. With that said, I didn't know how they would portray the Governor in the show considering that his actions are not exactly TV-approved or even movie approved for that matter.<br /><br />When season two ended with a preview of the Prison and the introduction of Michonne, I was ecstatic at what season three would offer. Now that season three has been mid season with the show returning February with the final eight episodes, I can say that I am very happy with how the TV portrayed the entire Woodbury and how the prison is turning out. It appears like the prison is going to be a permanent solution rather than a temporary one like in the comics.<br /><br />There are some things I don't like about the show. For one, it appears that everyone has unlimited ammunition and in no time are actual shells or parts are moving. Even more so, sometimes the weapons are flat out wrong. For example, Hershal used a ar15-style weapon at the start with the scope on backwards. Plus there's no recoil and it appears every gun effect was done post production. I guess it's more for safety reasons that they do this, but I think they should hire a better gun expert though I understand this show isn't about guns, it's kind of annoying that Rick and everyone appears to have an unlimited disposal of ammunition and the fact that the guns aren't working realistically. I personally think they should just do away with the guns. In the comic books, at least, guns are normally not used and it is very rare that they do use guns, unless it's against a living target.<br /><br />Another annoying thing is water and the fact that it seems like it's not a priority. They did the same in the comics but I find it a bit unrealistic that everyone seems to have plenty of water and nobody is really caring about water or lack there of. I haven't seen once in the entire show where water was even mentioned for supply or even carrying water. Not a single person has a water canister or even jugs of water or purifying water. I think this is rather annoying but again the show isn't about being a survival expert but still I think they should hire a survival expert to the show as well as getting a new weapons expert.<br /><br />As far as the show itself, I won't spoil it but I am very excited about the rest of season three. I can say that the entire Woodbury and prison segment is taking an exciting turn.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am a 62 year old man who downloaded the first book, not knowing it was geared to teens.  I loved it. No sex, no bad language and no graphic violence.  Refreshing in this day and<br /> age.  The second was even better and plan to read the final chapter.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Love it the delivery was easy...what else could i ask for,,,,,was for the mrs....she loves it more than i do<br />get it
B000JMKQX0|4.0|This book was super easy to read and interesting enough to read pretty quickly. Its style, however, doesn't really lead to any character development or attachment. Although I guess thats the point.
0547884591|5.0|Compounding on the writing style and success of his other books, \\"The 4-Hour Workweek\\" and \\"The 4-Hour Body\\", Tim Ferriss' finally opens Pandora's box and writes the book that many of his fans have been waiting for - The 4-Hour Chef.<br /><br />With a learning style unique to himself, Ferriss uses culinary arts and science, survival techniques and tactics, and a myriad of other amazing talents (learning a language in 7-days, anyone?) to actually teach others how to learn the way he does. It's under such methods that readers are able to learn anything, cook like a pro, and live the good life.<br /><br />Already 30% of the way into the book myself, I have made 2 delicious meals (a feat I've never accomplished prior to reading) for my family, feeling as though I've taken a short cut into actually knowing what it's like to cook. Not just follow a recipe, but ACTUALLY create a meal using ingredients as a good artist would select paints and canvas. Tim's rapid-skill-acquisition learning curve has also helped me in my own personal business, realizing that I can actually gauge where I am on the cycle of learning and implementing new ideas.<br /><br />The photos and \\"feel\\" of the book is excellent as well, pairing up great design with great writing and research.<br /><br />All in all, this book should get no less than 5-star ratings.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I bought this for my fiancé for his birthday, the only downfall is that it is the only movie he ever wants to watch! Overall, it was a great gift, especially for those who love the Alien series!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This it the BEST TV SHOW by far. People who haven't seen this your<br />totally missing out on one of the greatest shows. Stop watching reality shows and start watching a mind blowing zombie series.
B0054EU0H0|5.0|One cannot complain at this price. This product is a must for those cameras with lcd's / glass lens.  This product does it job very well. I have no problem with it. Delivery was on time.
B0036JU6CY|3.0|The story was good but the movie could of been better. It has great action and i only wanted to see Sung kang and Rain Bi.<br />If anyone likes these two actors its worth watching. i know i enjoed it.
B003B02OOG|5.0|John Grisham really delivers on this one.  I love it when his novels are based in Ford County.  It is the water he swims in and you can feel the essence and every nuance of the written page.  Don't miss this one - it's a real winner!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is a complete clock/alarm app. It has tons of customizable features. is is really intuitive and easy to use. i was up and running in less than a minute with lots of options.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great read.  This book leaves you with wanting to know what happens next.  I'm looking for the 3rd novel to come out soon, please!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I find this app hard to negotiate to include all of my Kindle Cloud items, especially new ones.  If I buy something on my new device, I cannot open it on my existing two Kindles.
1416549447|5.0|Over the years I had tried running and ended up with shin splints, knee problems, etc. and it was just too hard.<br />At age 65 this summer (now 66), I once again tried running, and I'm pleased as punch to say I completed my first 5K in less than 40 minutes in October!  I've since run 4 miles and several 3+ training runs with no pain or problems of any kind.<br /> It's all because of chi running technique.  It just makes total sense, especially since children run this way naturally.  It's so much easier on my whole body than landing on my heels like I did in the past.  I've always been a &#34;form junkie&#34; in other sports such as cross-country skiing and sea kayaking.  It seems to be a universal truth that when you come as close as you can to perfect form in any sport, it's not only easier on your body, it's easier period!  And, speed increases as a side effect.<br />Saving my joints and other body parts at this age is critical to me so I can stay active.  I applaud the authors of this book in giving me and countless others (including people who thought they could no longer run) the gift of running in a safe, pain-free way.  I truly believe that it's not running that causes injuries, but the WAY you run.  I heartily recommend this book and the principles of chi running.
0553584537|5.0|I have been looking for a new to me Author and I have found one, loved the book and will read the rest! Great book and I read it in short order, hard to put down!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Just received this last night....breathtaking! Must own for any true Batman fan! You will not be disappointed in any way.
B00846REIS|4.0|Don't get me wrong, I am a HUGE fan of 50 shades of Grey. However, I am aware that book is NOT well written.<br /><br />This book is definitely written by a true writer. The storyline is exciting, and it is written very well. I adore all three main characters because they're strong in their own positions. The only thing I don't like is the back & forth temperamental relationship. It's annoying how they keep running from each other, but it's a starting point in their relationship. Anyhow, I really enjoy this book, and can't wait to read the next one!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|this is a very fun game. and its ads are not a problem, or anoying. some of the levels can be hard and it can be addicting.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|This book was very hard to finish. The writing was awful, the main characters are annoying and wishy-washy. They're supposed to be in &#34;college&#34; but have a high school mentality. Terrible book, wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|i really enjoyed reading Bigger Leaner Stronger. i enjoyed the author's style and approach. Mike Matthews helped me skip a few years of trial and error and embark on a growth track that I believe will get the results I'm looking for. The warm up sets was something new to me and made complete sense. In many ways it was going back to basics for heavy lifting with weights. Of course because that has proven results. This is a great book for beginners and intermediate weight lifters. The nutritional advice was equally important.  It really comes down to that - success or failure is often with nutrition. I highly recommend this book! Get it and do it!
B000FC1HBY|4.0|There's a lot of politics and warring in this book. BUT, it is exciting to see what's going to happen next.
B005723JSQ|5.0|I really loved this book, and it inspired my to read more from this author, but I found quickly that I feel this to be far and away, her best work. I read it a few months back, and still smile when a memory from it drifts through my mind. I was especially enthralled by the use of text messages, and loved how an entire story evolved around the silly little things. Very creative and different. A die hard romantic, this book didn't disappoint at all. I really think it would make a wonderful movie, and hope some wise and successful producer would pick it up, cast a couple of Hollywood box office draws, and give me an entirely enjoyable afternoon at the movies with friends. Of course, it's well written charm stands on it's own, -please don't change the story at all, famous producer. Thanks!
0553584537|4.0|This book is about Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge who is a member of the State Trooper's STOP Team (A real unit the Massachusetts State Police). He gets called into the scene of standoff in upper class neighborhood of Beacon Hill located in Boston when the Boston Police's own SWAT team are at scene of another standoff in Revere(I'll get to that in a second.) Bobby is the first member of his team to respond to the incident. After taking that shot, Bobby is dragged into a world of lies, secrets, blackmail and the darkest of human hearts. Katherine Gagnon is not really the damsel in distress she seems at first. But did she do something to provoke her husband Jimmy to act in a violent behavior? Or were the lives of Katherine and son, Nathan in danger to begin with? Is Bobby Dodge the hero his colleges thinks he is or was he really a hitman oblivious to what he was really doing when he pulled that trigger?    I have to say that I found this book to be a great read and now Lisa Gardner is on a list of authors with a series I must read more about. I like the nice little nod to fellow author Tess Gerritsen who authored the Rizzoli and Isles series (that has been formatted into the TNT TV series) which are also set in Boston. As a fan of Boston-based mysteries, I have to say that this book was a treat. This is also where the character of Detective Sergeant D.D Warren is introduced. She is described as NYPD Blue meets Sex & The City (Fan of the Former much more than the latter, but I get the point). But being such a fun book to read, it also had its flaws. Now, I don't find these often but when I do, I'd just like to let the potential reader know what they're getting into. This is a fine book. With that being said, here are a few problems I have had. No doctor would give up privileged information, no matter how much he's in love or if he's talking to a disgraced cop. They will loose confidence from their patients that way. Another thing, Ms. Gardner keeps mentioningsemi-automatics as nine-millimeters. Now, I do not know everything about firearms anymore than the next guy with a computer or video game or action movie library, but I know that you cannot tell the caliber of a gun from a distance unless that is if you happen to zoom in on the gun and see the marking of the caliber on the slide or whatever. My point is that it could be a 9mm or it could be .40 caliber or .45. Not all semi-automatics are 9mm's. And a State Trooper in a tactical response team should know that more than anyone.    I think that is about it for the flaws. The story was entertaining, the characters colorful and even dark in most cases and here you get a little taste of D.D Warren, Ms. Gardner's reoccurring Boston Police Detective. Definitely a book worth reading.
B00AE6SS5O|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game.  So awesome that it is free at first and then quite inexpensive to buy the whole version.  I liked it better than some of the higher cost paid games I've played.  Credits were entertaining.
B004ZQ74G8|4.0|The author is very astute being able to put into words the way a child might view things when a room is all he has ever known. Ma is a wonderful heroin. She did such a remarkable job bringing up a child in a loving environment despite being held captive with her son. The  story was so moving. It must have taken a great deal of strength to put a positive spin on life in general for the sake of her son. Ma was so young when she was taken and yet she became an icon for great mothering. Jack, is highly evolved in someways and stilted in others considering his biggest educational tool is Ma. Considering the circumstances of his birth and life until he turned 5 years old, his progress seems accurate enough.<br />I find the book loses steam after the escape from the room. It kept me reading though and only just misses a 5 star rating.
030758836X|5.0|Let me start by saying that after I read some reviews, I had mixed feelings about whether I should buy this book or not. I have limited time to read so I usually stick to books with 4.5 stars or more, that's just how I roll. But I'd heard a lot of fuss about this one, so I compromised and put it on hold at the library. It took me five months to finally get my hands on it, and after the first 30 or so pages, I wasn't sure if I should keep going...but at my mom's urging, I did, and I must say, it was WELL worth it! What an exciting/disturbing book!<br /><br />Here's what I loved:<br />~The author's dark but humorous writing style. I found myself reading quotes aloud to my husband.<br />~The fast-paced action. I hate books that drag, and this one did not. It was impossible to put down.<br />~The twists! I thought I had it all figured out, several times. Nope. Not even close! The author was many steps ahead of me at all times. It was unpredictable. From reading the dust jacket blurb, I NEVER would have guessed where this was going.<br />~The creepiness factor. After I finished it, I laid in bed feeling pretty disturbed about the whole thing. I like a book that makes me think even after I'm finished reading.<br /><br />Anyway, if you like page turners and aren't easily offended (this one's graphic, sexual, violent, definitely an R) I recommend you give it a try. And definitely don't give up on it if you haven't gotten to section two yet.
B002ZG9846|5.0|I had never heard of this before, until it was introduced to me recently. This is a great movie that delivers an emotional roller coaster. Humor, lots of it. Empathy for the characters, sadness, and awe......awe at the amazing body count and graphic violence. Shock at the language.........and an amazing ending.<br /><br />Highly recommend if you don't mind sex,blood, gore and language presented in a package with a 9 year old star.<br /><br />A Comic super hero movie of an entirely different caliber!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The novel `Life of Pi' was only on my distant radar, until I saw the stunning scenes of this mega-3d movie made by Ang-lee, my brother by another mother.  Of course, I wanted to go `book first, movie second', since the other way around just doesn't work as well, so I jumped into the novel to free myself to see the movie.<br /><br />The Life of PI is the story of a young man, a religious studies and zoology major in college, who sees truths and beauty in 3 major religions so chooses to follow all of them.  This spiritual world gets hammered and tested when a shipwreck leaves him lost at sea on a lifeboat along with some of the animals his father was transporting to sell to other zoos.<br /><br />The novel was simply tremendous.  The writing was both easily digestible and yet filled with deeper implications. Piscine's, or \\"Pi's\\" thought patterns were intriguing, including his initial inquisitiveness and near naivety before the shipwreck, to his brain's struggle for survival and the delirium that follows, to his post-rescue riddling of the insurance representatives investigating the cause of the crash.  (This is not a spoiler, since the reader knows right up front that Pi survives.)<br /><br />This novel can be read simply for an action, intrigue, and the survival story which rivals any other, but my guess is there are tons of English professors who would love to see their students turn in papers with the following as subjects:<br /><br />~Symbolism of the Hyena, the Orangutan, the Frenchman, and especially, Richard Parker The Tiger.<br />Fear, nature, the Id or duality of man, childhood demons conquered (you're going to be a goat fed to the tiger, his brother tells him)<br /><br />~Compare the Tiger in Life of Pi to the volleyball `Wilson' in Castaway.<br />Okay, you may just get some laughs and nothing higher than a B+ if you write this paper.<br /><br />~Compare and contrast life before and after the boat, compare and contrast life on the boat to life on the island.<br /><br />~Role of carnivores versus omnivores in the novel.<br /><br />~Nature of storytelling itself.<br />Both in Pi's early desire to compare and contrast the mythology of major religion, to his story of how he survived the shipwreck, stories are presented as providing meaning and creating larger than life myths which lead to spiritual faith.  (Pi laments the lack of more grandiose stories in Christianity).  Does belief in a story make it more or less true?  When you are trying to tell the truth, is it best to do so in Fiction?<br /><br />Ah, to be in school again and spend hours writing such a paper into the wee hours of the night. Good for me, I can just enjoy and think as deep or shallow as I'd like.<br /><br />Among many others, one thing that has stuck with me is the things Pi had to do to get by. Eating animals as part of survival is described as both barbaric and instinctual, and the degree of Pi's desperate hunger leads to desperate measures. While reading, I made some out loud gasps at some of the ways Pi survived, causing others in the room with me to turn their heads and wonder what was on my kindle.<br /><br />But upon completing the novel and still savoring its taste, I found myself noticing all the food I waste and imagining what I would eat `if I really had to'. Like Upton Sinclair's \\"The Jungle,\\" Life of Pi maybe aimed for the heart but accidently hit the stomach as well.<br /><br />The odd thing is, many readers will discuss back and forth what was real and what wasn't real in the novel, but I like to believe, as I think the author and Pi himself believe, that it doesn't matter and it misses the point. Truth exists in the eye of the storyteller and the observer, and in the mind of the reader, so if you read about it, saw it in your minds eye, then it happened.<br /><br />This novel fired on all cylinders, and I'm going to be waving it under the noses of readers everywhere. And just like Tom Hanks who missed Wilson, and Pi who misses his tiger,I miss reading this novel each night.  At least I still have the movie.<br /><br />Mark Matthews,<br />Author of [[ASIN:B004EYUC10 Stray]] and [[ASIN:B005IQM8J2 The Jade Rabbit]]I miss reading this novel each night.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I like that this book is much more character-driven, relying on the motivations of the many characters more than the action to compel the reader.  There are actually two sets of characters, the adults and the teenagers, with equal importance given to both in terms of character development and plot.  While there is clearly good and bad in everyone, the teenagers proved to be the most likeable characters for me.

0143117564|4.0|his book drops you into the life of a private investigator named Doc who lives in Gordita Beach, in southern California. The book is written as though it is one in a series, referencing events that happened in the past and other cases Doc has worked on. I like that Pynchon has picked of these markers of the genre in which he is writing.<br />It is the very beginning of the 70s and Doc is a hippie. He is not the kind of hippie who goes on war protests or hides out with Black Panthers, but instead is what was probably the much more common type of hippie that smokes a lot of pot and finds himself friends with people who believe that a mythic island is going to rise out of the water off the coast or who send him on an acid trip in order to piece together the clues he has floating around in his brain. He is hired to fight a disappeared real estate mogul which links into a number of different conspiracies which were fun to thread together.<br />At times I felt like I was reading Hunter S. Thompson[[ASIN:0679785892 Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A Savage Journey to the Heart of the American Dream]]...some of the same random, driving through the night running into random characters and taking various substances kind of vibe. Although there is more of a plot than the standard Hunter S. Thompson and, it also seems, a different kind of point. Although Doc is very much of the time in which he is living, there are significant clues that the author is commenting on the times from the future. The Manson murders weave throughout the book as background and signal the darker side of the hippie culture which is to turn even worse as the 70s progress. One of Doc's associates has found out how to log into an early version of the internet and forecasts a time when we will all be under constant surveillance.<br />I really enjoyed this book. I would say, however, that if you are super hung up on plot this might not be the book for you. It does have an interesting plot but it takes almost too much concentration to follow it. It is better just to appreciate the vibes that are being sent out by this book and the commentary that is offered on the era in which it takes place and our own era.too much concentration to follow it.

B000JML7EC|4.0|I am going back and re-reading some of the classics. Very good book especially if you like the water and pirate tales.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really have enjoyed reading this series.  I'm wishing it didn't end at just three books!  Great for any reader in your family!
B002W5UVSM|5.0|Great book. Very funny. Great cast of characters. Also hits on some serious social issues. Toole does an excellent job jumping between different scenes. Would make a great move. Its amazing it to read the history of the failed attempts to get this made into a film.
B00304RMFE|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and if whether you are a Halo fan or not I think you will too. Great story telling, interesting characters, and amazing art styles.
B00979CS50|5.0|In my humble opinion, there should not be any review here less than 5 stars.  Why?  Well, Neil told us exactly what to expect, released Walk Like a Giant on his website, and released Americana, so anyone listening to this should, by this point, know EXACTLY what they are in for. And it is classic Neil Young, no doubt about it. The tracks themselves have been well reviewed here, though I disagree with the first reviewer who didn't particularly care for The Love of Man.  I felt like it gave the album a bit more heart.  And I really enjoyed the surprise \\"radio friendly\\" version of She's Always Dancing that appears at the end of the second disk.<br /><br />I am certainly not implying that this music is for everyone.  In fact, this would be a difficult introduction to Neil Young's music.  And for those who think Neil's career started and stopped with Harvest (or Harvest Moon), you might have a problem here.  But for those who still pull Tonight's the Night or Ragged Glory or Live Rust off the shelf and love them, this one's for you.<br /><br />So, my take on this is that there are four guys who believe that rock and roll can change lives, they get together every few years or so, and just play.  And Driftin' Back and Walk Like a Giant can stand with Like a Hurricane or Cortez the Killer any day of the week.  We are truly blessed that Neil Young and Crazy Horse still care enough to play for us.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Karen Mytych Cortese<br />great price, and a nice surprise gift (for no reason) for my son. I've seen it once or twice myself.
B0076DELIG|2.0|Had this been my first Harry Bosch book I'm afraid I wouldn't bother with the rest of them.  This book seemed unbelievably dry and none of the characters, except Maddie, were developed in any detail.  Every time the plot needed to be moved forward the action seemed very forced.  I got the feeling that a variety of characters interacted with Harry as they hurriedly crossed the stage and left with not enough back story or description to make me care about them, one way or another.<br /><br />In particular, I would have liked to know a lot more about the IAD detective, her prior police experience and motivation for wanting to be in IA.  Perhaps a little conflict with Harry's girlfriend whose sole purpose seemed to be as a babysitter for Maddie so Harry could leave for a few days.  And to leave the question of why a by the book officer followed Harry up north by merely saying she never said why, appears to me like an excuse to get the book over in a hurry.<br /><br />I know this is probably blasphemy, but I'm as old as Harry and was in the same field of work and I've been retired for quite a while.  If Harry retired for good in the next book after reflecting on a great career and solving one last case, I would be sad but satisfied.  Harry can't stick around long enough to end up as his daughter's training officer.
B001UU75WK|1.0|The science in this show is atrocious. I streamed the first 3 episodes and cringed in every single one. It feels as if they didn't even try to get it right. The episode with the brain surgeon murderer was probably the worst as it discussed a guy who surgically removed pituitary glands and ate them for the hormones to keep him young. While it is true that the pituitary gland controls aging, the show claims that consuming the pituitary allows the murderer to live longer. If anything, eating the pituitary gland would cause aging due to the consumption of growth hormone which stimulates cell division. This is just one of the many flaws with the science of the show and has led me to feel that it is not worth my time.<br /><br />All in all, this show made me feel sick to my stomach, It made me rage at the scientific inaccuracies, and it has poorly developed characters and a weak plot. Try it for yourself if you must but I don't think it's worth watching.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|Interested in where they go next.  Can they expand on this baseline?  I think she needs to let loose.  Effort was somewhat contained on most of the disc -- But, if she can let it go and belt it out this band could be great!

B008EZVNO0|3.0|I lie this...But, it's all been done by Van before.  He's a terrific writer and he sort of mailed it in.  Last few have been a bit uneven for me.  Looking for another Poetic Champions type of writing effort.  Every song on that disc (even though it wasn't popular with the critics), attempted to say something.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I just got this today and couldn't wait to stuff all my gear in it. I was totally amazed at how much it can hold! I am able to fit 2 camera bodies (a Nikon D60 and a D3200), my SB-700 speedlight, a set of magnification filters and 6 lenses (Sigma 70-300mm, Nikkor 55-200mm, Nikkor 50mm 1.8, Nikkor 18-55mm, Nikkor 35mm 1.8, and Nikkor 28-80mm). There is STILL more room for both chargers, cables, extra batteries, extra SD cards, business cards, etc. Amazing! I like the way it fits. It snaps across the chest and across the waist. The shoulder straps are nicely padded. The internal compartments are adjustable to accomodate and arrange different sized lenses and accessories. I would recommend this to anyone who has a lot of gear and can't bear to leave any at home.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|This guy can write...Pick up from mid-career's Bring The Family on up to now and you won't be disappointed, either.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Great 3d movie to ending the new batman saga. My wife (who isn't a movie fan), watched it twice with me and says it is a great movie. Good to know that batman wasn't killed off like some reports had said before the release. The ending was transitional as the whole movie was very intense keeping with the DC comic's character of the batman back in my day as a kid. Love it that Bruce Wayne ends up with the right kind of mate. Too, bad the saga is going to end here.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|A very readable and interesting look at healing and death in a holistic and spiritual context.  Highly recommended.  Foreward by Dr. Wayne Dyer.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Have been a Marvel Comics kid since the 60's and this movie did not disappoint. A great addition to my movie collection, the price was right and delivery was fast, Thanks Amazon.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Avoids the noise of the cameras'  innards, due to the auto focus feature of the camera.<br />It is small and, may I say, handsome.<br />Looks kind of professional.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|If this is the last book in this saga I'm very dissapointed. After 5 books and no closure? Also I was not impressed by each chapter being almost like a short story with no end. When I started book  one I was surprised to find out that I had to get through 4 more books only to be dumbfounded at the anticlimactic finish.
B000OCXI3K|4.0|Characters were interesting and I would have liked to meet them at a party or in my neighborhood. The transformative power of one person was clearly told by the twists and turns of the story. The chocolate treats described in the strory made my mouth water.The shop where a lot of the story took place was a very happy and pleasant place to shop, colorful and happy.Story ended and you could well imagine how the heroine's life would unfold.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Inception turned out to be an amazing movie with amazing visuals, great acting by the actors and an intense plotline.  It proves and shows how deep we can take our dreams and driven our minds can get when we want to achieve something we trually want.  The director proves how good of a director he can be besides the movie The Dark Knight which was great also.  But in the end if your just looking for an action movie with a very deep plotline, intense fight scences inculding guns, and all round amazing movie with wonderful actors then pick this movie up and make up your own mind up about if you like it or not.  I personally watched it 4 times in my lifetime and never get tired of watching it.
B000Q6GX5Y|2.0|Great price but a bad transfer.  The picture is very grainy for a modern Blu Ray rendition of a rather popular movie.
B000071ZZI|4.0|The Bourne Identity is a great spy movie with great job by Damon as the main character.  The movie itself keeps your intrest all the way threw from start to finish.  What did it for me was the fight and car chase scences, I mean having high car chase scence threw heart of Paris priceless.  Plus the stunts in the movie helps make the movie amazing and very enjoyable.  So if you yet to watch this movie pick it up and savor a great spy flick with amazing shots of country side and city of Paris, plus great acting by the actors in it and action scences that will blow you away everytime you watch it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I was expecting just the movies on Blu Ray when i ordered this and it comes with extras...for 30 bucks that is awesome not to mention they are done justice in HD. More value at a lower price.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|Damon hits it out of the park again with this movie The Bourne Supremacy.  Trually a great action movie with plenty of stunt work, amazing car chase scene threw Russia, and all the sites seen in the movie make it beautiful to see over and over again.  They filmed in Germany, Russia, India and Italy.  I enjoy all the camera work just blows you away at what people can do with the right motivation and skills.  This sequal lives up to the first movie, tops it with the car chase scene.  The plotline about the same but I enjoy most is that bourne makes the right choice and fixes the past mistake.  So if you love your action movies, gun hand to hand fights, high speed chases so forth then pick this movie up and savor an intense action movie with lots to offer people from start to finish.

B009RX7IX8|5.0|I have enjoyed Castle since the beginning and have even read the books, which must be written by the show's writers because they exactly minic Nathan Fillion's version of Castle.  Now that there is actual romance in the series, I think it's much better, although the 4 seasons of wiil they or won't they was fun, too.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter is based on &#34;A PRINCESS OF MARS&#34; by Edgar Rice Burroughs. For the most part it stuck pretty closely to the original tale which was written over 100 YEARS AGO. If some people felt that there was nothing new in this movie, it's because Burroughs influenced science fiction for the next hundred years with his imagination. Flying ships. Stealth technology. Guided missiles. Auto pilot. These were all imagined by a man in a time before air travel was a mere novelty.<br /><br />If Disney publicized this the right way, it would've been the blockbuster it should've been instead of just breaking even. I hope they decide to give the franchise another shot, as Burroughs wrote nearly a dozen books in the &#34;Barsoom&#34; series.

In fact when I finally reached the end after 3 days of constant playing I was a little disappointed. In fact if it wasn't for the hint (spoiler) button I don't think I could have navigated so well. It worked on my kindle just fine. I was reluctant to download because of some of the reviews but I had no problem.

While yes, cheff-ery (a word I just made up) is made simple at a pro-like level it also goes beyond into teaching the fundamentals for learning all types of skills - from memory to languages.

B008QE9XD2|2.0|I don't know much about the TV Show. To me, it's like \\"The Addams Family\\" or what-have-you. A program about a family of monsters or strange characters. All I know is that when you hear that The tag-team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp will make a film version of that popular TV show, you immediately find that it's a given. You become excited. You think of the usual gothic-like set decorations of Burton's movies, you think of his usual eerie-yet-fantasy-like-music made by his friend Danny Elfman, you think about his excellent actress-of-a-wife (Helena Bonham-Carter) that you know we'll be in it somewhere, you also think about the superb cast of well-known actors and actresses that you know wil grace the screen, Well, you think of all that and you're bound to have great expectations for this cinematic proposition.  And then, you even hear that Alice Cooper, the legendary morbid and funny singer will have a cameo. How can you not have a great time? How can they mess it up?<br /><br />Well, they didn't mess it up. Not exactly. But you think... all this for... that? For what, exactly? What was the goal? This movie is spectacular. It's well acted. Everything that dress it up is excellent. But what's inside? What was the point? At the level where Tim Burton is, after making a great film like \\"Big Fish\\", I would have expected something deeper with this \\"Dark Shadows\\". A second and a third layer to the story. A metaphor for something else. Like \\"The Shining\\" by the late Stanley Kubrick.<br /><br />Roger Ebert, the great critic, summed it up well: \\"All dressed up but nowhere to go\\". We have a great intro, not classic, but great nonetheless. Then, we follow for a good twenty minute the new and young governess, how she is introduced to the strange family and what will be her goal. Then we forget about her and she becomes a secondary character! The problems continue: you don't quite get the bizarre attraction that the witch (Eva Green) has for Depp's character, you only learn about the true nature of the daughter at about... 15 minutes until the end of the film, the father has nothing interesting to offer to the plot, the mother seems to simply stand on top of the stairs all day long, the witch simply tells the sheriff at the end that the strange family is responsible for the explosion of a warehouse and he believes her right away with only a tape recorder as proof (no she didn't use any hypnotic power), then the cops and the whole village hunts the family down, surround the Mansion and... suddenly disappear (even the cops!) even if the whole house is on fire with an epic battle of supernatural beings inside of it...<br /><br />All of this, plus the fact that they misused Alice Cooper (who seemed to have been set up for a bigger role), well of this makes me think that Burton simply went through the robotic moves of storytelling. The characters do this and that because they need to do it and that's it. Because the story demands it. The movie seemed to want to go somewhere and then, the same movie seemed to had forgotten about its purpose and simply went on automatic. When it ends, you're left disappointed.  Something is missing. A direction. A vision. A goal for all of this. Simply relying on the talent of Johnny Depp is not enough. The film is constantly flirting with greatness but always misses it. It's a very disappointing offering by a great director. It's not a disaster, mind you. Simply, it's irrelevant.<br /><br />Maybe that's worse.
B008458O3S|5.0|Well written, easy to understand. Tough to complete. Did not get stuck until last<br />few puzzles. Really busted my brain over them. I got it as FAOTD, but would<br />pay for it
B005LAIISA|5.0|I chose this rating because the grand kids are happy with the product. What would I know other than it looks good and seems to be pretty cool.
B005SZAEYO|5.0|This show is good, but Season one could have been better. It was some what boring at times and I think Season 2 made up for a lack luster Season 1. I will still watch whatever they put out in the future though. There aren't enough horror shows like this!
B004G600A4|5.0|I chose this rating because the grand kids are happy with the product. What would I know other than it looks good and seems to be pretty cool.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|This movie is amazing. I can't wait to see the next one! I was able to plug in my computer to my tv and watch it. Love it!
B004PGO25O|4.0|I've now read all of Pressfields non-fiction work and its just outstanding. In this book he continues some thoughts from previous work but the bottom line is he teaches us to focus on the end, begin with the end in mind so to speak and block the expected resistance and deliver the work you set out to do. He says it much better than me but worth the read for those who want to complete the work they start.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The BD also include the Especial Edition 1991, 2003 or Directors Cuts.. THX, DTS-HD, Dolby the four  BD are Doble Layer!! great quailty..
141659521X|4.0|Vince Flynn has another winner on his hands with The Last Man.  Buy it and read it.  You will not regret it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was an enjoyable read holding my attention to the end.  Can't wait until Walking Disaster comes to the market.
0399157565|5.0|I really enjoyed this newest Scarpetta novel. The book begins with a mysterious video sent to Kay via email showing Kay the last few minutes of a victim's life, a victim Kay doesn't even know exists at this point. The twists and turns that follow in this book are so skilfully done you have trouble putting the book down for any reason. I enjoy a surprise ending and you really don't expect the the perpetrator to be who it is in the end! A must read for every Scarpetta fan!!!!!
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie but my son nd I love it. If you watch in HD the colors are very vibrant. My son was glued to the TV
B008HK3XOU|5.0|My kids that will have 5y old use the Kindle (Free Time) ... This case make him very safe... and still make the Kindle stand up...
B00A8ECU24|4.0|at first I was like, &quot;meh. &quot; but now I can't put it down. Brony officially addicted. if you love ponies then give it a try, it is free after all.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|Great movie, the packageing was great, the dvd was not scratched.  Watched it all the way through without any problems
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have all Angry Birds games on my Kindle FIre ( bought in 2011)  and love them all but this has now become my favorite.  Wish their were more episodes.  A bit pricey since the game cost $2.99 then asked for another $1.99 in the middle of the game to get another series - BUT STILL WORTH IT to me.  Please keep those Angry Birds games coming.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Great shape, watched this season the first day i received it and i was very satisfied with what i got.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This has been quite entertaining for me.  I like that you get a different sign (check mark vs star) for either completing or completing perfectly each level.  I have played a lot, but still have many unplayed levels left.  And I don't think it would be a problem to replay earlier levels, either.  Fun game!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|By now you know what the movie is about, so I won't rehash.  What you have here is the anti-Sully Sullenberg.  Denzel is incredible as the best pilot you don't want flying your plane, or do you?????  Tough questions and tough decisions as Denzel deals with, or doesn't deal with, the aftermath.  You pull for him every step of the way, but the problem is which way do you pull?  Make sure the little kiddies stay home, but you need to see this movie.  I hope the Academy hands Denzel the Oscar.<br /><br />Don't read too many reviews, you want to experience the film before you read every little detail.
B0060D196K|5.0|Well done,scarier than I expected considering it is animation,but Disney always does a great job.One of my favorites and I have the book too,which is great.Also a great job by Jim Carrey.Love the creepy feeling throughout most of the show.Excellent special affects.
B007HACDLK|4.0|While Vince Flynn has put forth another exciting plot line with the intriguing and often dark CIA world of a covert special operations, this was not his most stellar storytelling.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I am obsessed with this album, it is worth every penny (In my opinion) and I am glad that I made the purchase!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Lots of fun, new twist on a well know figure, characters develop and grow gradually throughout the season. Manages multiple stories within the hour.
B00709GTGS|5.0|I would encourage anyone to upgrade their older VHS or DVD movies to at least Bluray 2D quality (3D for those who have 3D grade TV’s) as the quality of the picture is 100% better then VHS tapes and nearly 50% better then DVD's. The sound quality has been improved and upgraded as well. Most Blu-ray’s have many more features that can be viewed as well which make for a much fuller movie experience too! Oh and just so you know, even if you don't own a Bluray movie you should go buy an on sale Bluray player. Why? Because a Bluray player scans the disk many more times than just a standard DVD player, that it will even make your older DVD movies look much better. That is, as long as you have a flat screen type of TV that was purchased in the last five years. Good luck and go get some!
B005FITIF0|5.0|Very good movie.....I'll watch it again and again.  I read the book about the preacher and was so glad to know there was also a movie.

B001EN71CW|5.0|I don't remember ever watching this series when it was on TV but just recently heard about it and also about Serenity (the movie) and am so glad I did.  The show had a great cast and they were all so complimentary of each other.  The movies helps to finish it, so be sure to purchase both of them.  Hope you love them as much as I did!!!
0811879631|5.0|This book is way better than what I expected, it's full of beautiful and inspiring art from beginning to end.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I read the books several years ago and was so happy when the show came on TV.  I never miss even one show.  I will keep watching and then buying the shows until they take them off...which I hope won't happen for a long time.  Great series!!!
6304806434|5.0|So funny I can't wait a few months and see it again...<br /><br />A must for anyone who has ever been on Fremont Street.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|My husband loves this series of books.  I load them on the Kindle and he reads them.  He wouldn't want to miss even one book.
B00003CXRP|5.0|This movie which has few words shows what it would be like<br />to be stranded on an unihabited island for 4 years.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I didn't watch the series when it was on TV but just recently heard about it and this movie helps to round out the series.  I just bought it for my son for Christmas, too.  I watched both the series and the movie on Netflix then ordered a set for myself and one for my son.  Really good movie.

B009O2XY12|5.0|Haven't tried it yet...but going by what my granddaughter Veronica said...I give it 5 stars (she's 20 and she loaded it on my Kindle because she loves playing it and she says I will, too.)
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I'll admit i was a bit skeptical, but this live action full feature film may go down as one of the best video game inspired movies of all time  !!!!<br /><br />I am looking forward to sharing this gem with my friends, family and co-workers!!!<br /><br />Job well done 343 studios.<br /><br />Buy this as a treat for yourself, your happy place will thank you... right after you get goose bumps. suspense, pathos and really good acting!.. it should win awards.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I've read so many romance books AND they even had better sex than this one did.  I will have to say that I did like the characters though, but I've read much better writing.  I'm not sure why this book was such a success but I was very happy just reading this first one and making it the last.  Just not as good as all the hype made it seem.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|Had the previous version that  worked very well. I updated to the newer version and now it doesn't work at all. I'd like to go back to the previous version so I can actually use it again. May just delete the app altogether.
B007THA4FI|2.0|did you really have to go trashy? would not let my kids or very worst enemy read this.  very much disappointed
B0053O89RY|5.0|You can watch this over and over and never get sick of it!!!<br />For all ages, timeless and very funny ...SUPERB !!!
B00138KEZ4|5.0|Sarah McLachlan does it again.  She has got to be one of the best songwriters of the last few decades.  While this album is not an entirely original on her part, her voice and style are still mesmerizing.  Any fan of Sarah's will be pleased with this purchase for their Christmas collection.
B008ACC9CM|3.0|Too polished, over produced, lacks the raw quality of a live performance.. only good for back ground or dinner music and on low level volume only...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Well worth the price.  This is one of the few things that gets my 2yo to nap.  My daughter loves mixing the sounds to create her own blend.  This is one if my favorite apps!
6305428050|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I watched it and got it for my husband who has a little crush on Elisabeth Shue!
B007UWBQEU|5.0|Carrie Underwood continues to be one of my favorite artists.  She always creates an album that has a good mix of song styles
B00A993UWM|4.0|A quality album by Ke$ha that doesn't have too many filler tracks. This album has more of an all over the place feel than just pure pop like Animal. If you don't like her style already then this album won't convert you.
B009VLXMJA|5.0|My daughter continues to enjoy Taylor's music.  I enjoy listening to the stories in her music and the different styles of the songs.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is really fun! I enjoy it all the time! This game is a great way to pass time!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this video more than a year ago, and I still use it regularly. I have never stuck with a workout program this long. I like it because it features three different workouts of only 20 minutes each. I can get a challenging workout (sweat, sore muscles, heart pounding) in less than half the time of a typical workout video. Whenever I try to talk myself out of working out, I just say, &#34;You can do anything for 20 minutes!&#34;<br /><br />The workouts are VERY challenging, especially for beginners. The first time I did it, I could hardly walk the next day! But my body got stronger very quickly, and I was moving up to more challenging workouts in no time.<br /><br />The whole &#34;30 day shred&#34; idea is not exactly true. For one thing, I don't work out every day. I think your muscles need a day's rest in between. And I wouldn't say this video has gotten me &#34;shredded.&#34; I'm a 41-year-old woman with two kids. I couldn't be shredded if I could afford a full-time trainer! But I have gotten significantly stronger, and my endurance has improved tremendoulsy.<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this video to anyone who is looking for a regular workout video that is challenging and fun. If Jillian Michael's voice annoys you, there is even an option to turn off the audio and just listen to the music.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book I got for the Kindle.  The book was great, and just as advertised, the book downloaded in less than a minute!  Please Read this book!... its amazing
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This book is Jack Reacher at his best.  The characters are very like able and you care what happens to them.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not read this book fast enough! It's a great love story and the ending was surprising! I felt for what Katie/Erin was going through! I am so excited to watch the movie version!!
1594202842|4.0|To say that Amy Chua is a devoted parent is like saying the Sun is a good source of light. HUGE understatement. And she can't help but clash with Americans who allow their children more personal freedoms, even if that means the child chooses arts and crafts over math and science. Welcome to Amy Chua's traditional Chinese parenting model.<br /><br />What makes Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother so endearing, and worth reading, is watching Amy express just as much self-doubt as she does confidence. The Chinese method is superior--she's sure of it!--except when it doesn't work, and then she struggles with what to do next. These revelations connect her with the reader through a hint of sympathetic vulnerability. At one point she even admits that Chinese parents don't handle failure well, and experiencing failure is arguably the best teacher there is.
1451627297|5.0|This book is incredibly detailed and held me throughout.  It has a lot of hidden meaning that gets you to think about that \\".....if I would have only\\".....\\" or \\"....if I could only....\\".  It also reminds us that little things can set the future on a totally different path.  Very well done Stephen King.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I am reading this book and the information is very useful, since the lenguage tips to cooking course. Another good book from Tim Ferris
B003SI9WYG|5.0|Instant classic. I saw this movie when I was younger in theaters and I still love every minute. Jack and Sally!
B007EW9ISM|1.0|The air gap on one I got is so large you have to jab hard to make it work at all.
B009NIJNLW|5.0|Good flick. The movie came with an extra snowboard DVD and a bunch of stickers that I wasn't expecting...l super cool
B005LAII08|4.0|There are over 800 reviews of this movie as I write this, so obviously this has been reviewed many times before.<br /><br />Because it already has so many reviews, this is not a review of the movie itself, but specifically of the 3-D portion. Some 3-D movies are really incredible, with objects \\"flying\\" out at you and things \\"floating\\" in your living room. These 3-D movies, in my opinion, are absolutely worth the extra money. Others, however, simply give the movie another layer of depth, but are not really that different from the blu-ray version. This is the case for Brave. Great movie, but I was very disappointed with the 3-D effects. Save yourself the extra money and buy the blu-ray version instead. If you want a great Disney movie with fantastic 3-D effects, buy Tangled instead. The 3-D effects are unbelievable!<br /><br />(I gave it 4 stars because it is a very good movie, but minus one because of the 3-D effects.)
B0093X805W|4.0|From the moment I got my Kindle for Mother's Day, I had been trying to get a digital copy of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. My husband is a fan of the Gene Wilder musical Willy Wonka movie. I preferred the Tim Burton version - I felt it was actually closer to the book than the musical.  I was pleasantly surprised to find out that there were elements of the book in the musical that were not in the Burton film, and that I was also correct in my observation that the Tim Burton film stayed closer to the book. Neither of the films were totally faithful. Thank you for making the book available for kindle.
B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled is a great movie, as you can see from the hundreds of rave reviews.<br /><br />Because there are so many reviews available, this review is not of the movie itself (which we all loved), but more specifically of the 3-D version of it. Some 3-D movies have really good 3-D effects, with objects seeming to come out of the screen at you. Others simply display more depth and aren't that different from a regular blu-ray (which is the case for the Disney movie Brave. Great movie, but don't buy the 3-D version. Save your money and just buy the blu-ray).<br /><br />In the case of Tangled in 3-D, the 3-D effects are fantastic. In fact, it has the best 3-D effects of any 3-D movie we own (and we own quite a few.) There are several times during the movie when it seems like an arrow or an axe is being thrown straight at you, and at the end of the movie there is a part with floating lanterns, and it truly looks like the lanterns are floating in our living room. Awesome! If you have a 3-D tv and are wondering if spending the extra moolah on the 3-D version is worth it, I promise you it is!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really like this book it was different but still could not put it down...Waiting for the next in the series
B004K4IZ54|3.0|This movie was not the best movie in the world, but it wasn't bad either. Definitely worth watching once or twice. And it's clean, which is hard to find these days, so that is a very nice bonus.<br /><br />My main focus on this review is the 3-D effects of the movie, which weren't good. It wasn't much different than a blu-ray version, and to be completely honest, if the two were playing side by side it would be hard to tell the difference. Do not buy the 3-D version. Save your money and buy the blu-ray instead.
B008BO61BE|1.0|Don't waste your cash on this terrible remaster. This is the last remastered album / disc i will buy. Everything is mastered so compressed with the thinking the everyone listens to music on mp3 players, well that is NOT the case! There are still people who care what the music actually sounds like. This is just another thin glassy sounding remaster that sounds terrible on a real stereo or a high quality car stereo. Very, very disappointing!!! This Is Supposed To Be HEAVY Metal & It Sounds Like Tin Foil.
0345529057|5.0|READ THE SET AND LOVED IT THEN GAVE IT TO MY SON<br />ALTHOUGH HE HAS A NOOK SO HE COULD PASS IT ON<br />TO HIS FRIENDS AFTER READING.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game because it keeps my 9-yr. old entertained and he seems to really enjoy playing this game.  What I don't like about the game is that it is a continuum of square-runs and not many obstacles are included in the app.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie.  At first I didn't like it but as the movie played I liked it more.  Still don't like the main character though.  What she did was awful
B007TXN4TK|2.0|I gave this app 2 stars because it wasn't very user-friendly unless you purchase more songs to play.  I didn't like the fact that you couldn't just play simple piano without a song attached to it and there weren't many songs to choose from.  It's ok entertainment for 2 minutes and then you get bored with it.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Dis jointed . No clear direction.  Why have a series of stories that are so loosly conected.<br />I saw the movie first and hoped that the book would clarify things. It didn't.
B0079R8KO0|3.0|I ordered this cover for my Kindle Fire HD. This cover did not fit so I had to return it. The order delivery time was great and the help with returning the cover was quick and easy. If it had been the correct item it would have been a good value for my money.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Walking Dead.  In Season 3, the Zombies are almost an interesting side note.  The real story is now about human conflict and how Rick Grimes struggles to keep his group alive while keeping his sanity.
B008476HBM|5.0|I know most teens whine & complain when assigned classics to read for school, but this book is so much more than required reading. I first read it in 5th grade (my reading level was advanced for my age #humblebrag lol) and I read it over and over, never tiring of the crisp, Victorian language or heart-rending love story. Read with an open mind!
B009YU62H2|4.0|Similar to other reviews, if you are hoping for another BadMF, this is not it.  I had to listen to it 2-3 times before I fell in love with it.<br /><br />This is very similar to their last couple of albums, but the album is good top to bottom (and not sure I can say that about the others)<br /><br />You will not be dissapointed in this if you are a SG fan.  Excellent vocals, and excellent riffs....just excellence all the way around<br /><br />This rivals BMF it is that good!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|A Myst like game (but much easier). As you move from screen to screen, you generate a map so you can check back when you nee to return. I kind of wish you could return to a location by using this map, but perhaps that would make it too easy. I haven't had to use any of the hints and have gotten quite a ways into the game. I have a friend playing it as well so we're giving hints to each other
1580084621|5.0|This is an awesome book. If you have any interest in Thailand you will appreciate the first portion of the book that discusses Thai life in incredible detail. I would have bought the book just for this part, even for the pictures!  We could not find a source for kaffir lime tree leaves, so we ordered a tree. It is beautiful.<br /><br />If you want to cook a meal that could pass for Thai, this is the book for you.
B007V65R54|3.0|I have been following Nate Silver's trajectory since he launched 538 during the 2008 election cycle.  His insights have been excellent.  His book has some great ideas and and examples of where predictions and the process of making them work and don't work.  His writing style is a bit tortured with too many complex sentence structures.  He needs a good editor to help him convey these very useful and important ideas in more readable style.
0062215507|3.0|I have the first edition and this one only has an extra four pages.  The photo album was quite disappointing, but if you do not have the original addition, this would still be good to have.  Amazon shipped this package very poorly so that all the pages are bent so please do not buy this from them.
B007MG360G|2.0|it was ok but it needed more challenges the demo was so short. I had no promblem with it after. I read the instructions

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved everything about this book! It was a light read without the typical cheese usually found in similar romance titles. I recommend this book.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'll definitely try to read more of this author's books.  I lived through this period and could relate of all of it.

B000SFP64W|5.0|There probably has been no greater debut album in the history of rock in terms of an emergence of a true revolutionary in rock guitar then when `Are You Experienced' was released in May 1967. The Jimi Hendrix Experience exploded onto the scene, first in the London clubs where such rock luminaries as the Beatles, the Stones and Eric Clapton (among many others) bore witness then at the Monterey Festival where Jimi became a superstar in the country of his birth. There was rock guitar before Hendrix and then after him as no one, with the exception of maybe Edward Van Halen, has been credited with defining the vocabulary of electric guitar with such a force of volcanic raw emotion.  The first record is quite simply the most important rock guitar LP ever made (is there even a debate on this???).  Hendrix along with his English band mates Noel Redding and Mitch Mitchell openly challenged Clapton's Cream for power trio supremacy.  The debut features many classics including \\"Foxy Lady\\", \\"Manic Depression\\", \\"Red House\\", \\"Fire\\" and the title track. The British LP didn't include \\"Hey Joe\\", \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\" which were pre-LP singles in the UK. However whether you buy the UK or US version, you will still get all the songs (US one has the three aforementioned classic hits but no \\"Red House\\",  \\"Can You See Me\\" and \\"Remember\\", but the CD version includes all of them). Any way you slice, `Are You Experienced' is essential to any serious rock collection. Have you ever been experienced????

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have never written a book review, although I have read many, BUT, I have read a LOT of books, however, not typically Stephen King, although I loved Stand By Me.  Like Stand By Me, Stephen this book is well-written and has totally absorbed me in the story to such an extend that it invades into my real life and my dreams.  There are so many lessons to be learned from the ideas that all of us have of, &#34;if I could only change the past, I would...&#34;  11/22/63 is so very well thought out about that premise, how the universe works, and the consequences and ramnifications of such actions that we may not have considered.

B008HK3XU4|2.0|Bought three separate cases to help keep the devices easily recognizable.  Bought a purple, orange and red.  Purple works without exception and as intended.  I wish I could say the orange and red did too - but they do not.  I must have gotten two duds.  I must install their respective Fire devices upside down (camera on right side when opened & all buttons on the bottom) in order for the automatic sleep/wake function to work properly.<br /><br />Should I send these 2 back???  1/3rd satisfaction rating here.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|Catan has become hugely popular as you may already know.  It's part of the new generation of games coming out that are focused on keeping the entire group involved until the end.  As an added bonus this game is non violent but still loads of fun.<br /><br />You basically get resources and work towards building stuff that get you MORE resources until you have built enough that you won the game, unless someone bets you too it.  Very easy to learn but randomizing the board pieces also means that games will not play out the same each time.<br /><br />Cards Against Humanity, \\"Things\\", Taboo, Cranium are also 2nd gen games worth purchasing.
B000M5NRLC|5.0|didnt like it the first time i saw it, a bit overwhelming, but it grows on you. it's in the line up from now on!

B004CLYKLI|4.0|I am a \\"Western Parent\\" and value a different set of parenting skills but I appreciate the honesty and the transformation of parenting in this book. I think that when you read you need to read it not as a generalization of all parents in China or the West but as only her perspective and experience. All good mothers change their strategy as they themselves learn and grow with their children.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|This Lego set sells for around 35 dollars at Target!!! This is sickening to see these individuals and companies raise the prices of these lego toys 4 and 5 times their original price to make a buck at Christmas.!! ! And shame on you Amazon for participating  in it!! This toy is not available anywhere now for its original price but I will gladly wait until after Christmas to purchase it instead of paying wayyy more than what its worth. Some parents think that their kids wont breath unless they get everything thay want at Christmas and they will go to whatever means necessary to get it. The same thing is happening with the new Lloyd Ninjago figure. It sells for 12.00  at target when in stock but I have seen it for 30 and 40 dollars recently ! If people would stop paying these ridiculous prices for these toys  the toy companies wouldnt be able to get away with it. Some of us still have a little self control and know our kids would better off not getting everything their heart desires. Anybody else agree??
B008IJTFYW|5.0|What a lovely app .. it actually does what it's promoted as doing .. I can see how young children would enjoy it as well.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|I hate cooking and, although I've long been *interested* in the way Tim Ferriss' brain works, I wouldn't consider myself a outright fan. The Four Hour Chef, however, has been a game-changer for me. It's a lot of fun and, in a lot of ways, not really about cooking. It's about rapid, targeted skill acquisition. It's amazing. Since I've started reading/doing, it feels as though I'm packing a s***-tonne more living into every hour. Thanks, Tim. Seriously.

B001IYCMNA|1.0|This model has a severe disconnect problem that Cisco is aware of. Updating to the most recent firmware does not help the issue. The cisco forums confirm this issue as well.You must go through the hassle of having your service request sent to level 2 engineering and have a beta firmware sent to you. takes days of communication and simply not worth the time and effort because the beta firmware does not solve the problem. they do not have a model to replace it either so I'm out the money spent.<br />simply put, do not buy this product.

B004XJ7HSM|3.0|Indeed, this movie is not for everyone. Same old boy meets girl story dressed up in with a Matrix twist. The ending would or should be clear to any 12 year old. If you have nothing better to do and love a fairy tale ending, then by all means order this one. Yawn
B00127RAJY|5.0|Just received this product.  Jullian sure can kick your butt.  I haven't hit the 30 days yet but can tell you that you use this tape and you will loose weight.  Would recommend to anyone who wants to have a good workout, have fun and loose a few pounds.

B009CPJHY4|3.0|This would have been wonderful had the plot lines been more fully integrated. It was far too contrived. The location was terrific, and the Indian actors were a treat. The cultural themes were intriguing as well. I would watch these English actors read the phone book so I enjoyed it, but it will likely have limited appeal to those not older and dealing with  or anticipating dealing with end of life issues. In the end I felt cheated. It should have been a great film instead of just okay.

B009682EFQ|5.0|HONOR FOUND IN DECAY is another great Neurosis album.  It breaks no new ground, but rather consolidates the sound of their \\"Albini period\\" which started with TIMES OF GRACE (1999).  The theme of the record, hinted at in the superb Josh Graham artwork, is social collapse and a return to a simpler way of life, closer to the Elements.  \\"Civilization\\" is destroying the Earth -- that is a central dark truth that runs through all of Neurosis's music.<br /><br />The seven tracks are:<br /><br />We All Rage In Gold<br />At the Well<br />My Heart For Deliverance<br />Bleeding the Pigs<br />Casting of the Ages<br />All Is Found ... In Time<br />Raise the Dawn<br /><br />After swerving from the path of all-out intensity to the inward-looking, ambient sounds of A SUN THAT NEVER SETS (2001) and THE EYE OF EVERY STORM (2004), the band returned to the \\"hypnotic, super-heavy loud music\\" they are known for on GIVEN TO THE RISING (2007).  That record took TIMES OF GRACE (1999) and added a touch of the ambient atmospherics of TEOES.  GTTR stands as my favorite Neurosis album.  HONOR FOUND IN DECAY doesn't hit as hard as GTTR, nor is it as moody and ambient as TEOES.  It's less extreme, but fashions strong new \\"songs\\" out of the same raw sonic materials.<br /><br />*** *** ***<br /><br />Neurosis began as a hardcore punk band in Oakland in 1985.  They shared the speed, intensity, and anarchist politics of that movement -- against war, racism, Reagan and Thatcher.  SOULS AT ZERO (1992) was the turning point when they slowed the music down and began to develop their innovative, massive, metal sound.  (They're usually mentioned as a key influence on \\"post-metal,\\" but their trajectory was actually from punk to metal, so post-punk.)  Building this new sound further on ENEMY OF THE SUN (1993), most fans seem to agree that they produced their Nineties masterpiece with THROUGH SILVER IN BLOOD (1996), which is a maximum sonic assault with sound samples (very Eighties), psychedelic flourishes, and quieter passages mixed with the titanic guitar chords and tribal drumming.<br /><br />The band's more recent music seems to have a smaller audience.  On TOG they stripped down the sound with the help of producer Steve Albini, creating a more austere sound that to my ears sounds more powerful.  Albini has produced all the band's albums since then.<br /><br />*** *** ***<br /><br />The lyrics of Neurosis are poetic and oblique, and evade any simplistic, literal interpretation.  So here is my interpretation of what the band is about, based on lyrics, interviews, history, and my own listening and experience.  All metal is about death and pain.  This is part of its appeal, in addition to the sheer energy and intensity.  But whereas metal by definition deals with the fact of death, which we must all confront, it seems to me that Neurosis has extended their early Eighties punk politics to a more sweeping indictment of industrial capitalist \\"civilization.\\"  The lyrics hint at a neopagan vision of life in intimate connection with the Earth, with the seasons, with all Life.  This is not adolescent rebellion, and it is not nihilism.  Neurosis confronts the death of our way of life, both now, in its alienation, its separation, from the Earth, but impending ecological collapse as the ecosystem is methodically destroyed.  Was the Nineties a time to celebrate the victory of capitalism?  No, it means alienation and ecological devastation have been in hyperdrive.<br /><br />Hendrix said \\"I Don't Live Today,\\" -- \\"existing -- nothing but existing.\\"  This alienation fuels much punk and metal.  But I believe as the members of Neurosis have grown older they still feel that, feel it more deeply, rather than moving on from it and seeing it only as an adolescent phase -- they refuse to \\"become comfortably numb.\\"  Steve Von Till, the source of the quote in my review title as well as the \\"hypnotic, super-heavy, loud music\\" quote, has said the band attempts to go \\"somewhere deeper, somewhere more emotional, somewhere elemental.\\"<br /><br />\\"When you learn to surrender to something bigger than yourself, you're acknowledging the realm of spirit -- and where else does music come from?  I have no idea, but it feels like it's not just deep in the core of us, but deep within the core of the Earth, the stars, and everything else.\\"<br /><br />I see this music as an expression of a deep connection with the ground of being, with life, with the elemental.  There is a dark side to this, yes.  What Jung called \\"the shadow\\" is respected and recognized.  Darkness is part of the cycle of light and darkness and to fail to absorb this is to fail to be fully alive.  Moving through darkness, moving through pain, moving through ritual, and emerging stronger is an ancient core human experience.<br /><br />There is something Wagnerian in Neurosis, something tragic and grandiose, but their music does not involve stories about characters.  There are no masks.  The bellowing vocals are the first person \\"I,\\" the I of every one of us.  What the music expresses in all its raging intensity is something inside us that is wounded, something that connects us to all Life.<br /><br />*** *** ***<br /><br />From the neopagan Earth-based perspective death is part of life.  Fall and Winter follow Spring and Summer in the cycle of the seasons.  Decay therefore is a necessary part of the Whole.  The personal path of wisdom and growth includes cycles of decay, death, rebirth and new growth.  Ultimately we die and our bodies decay, giving rise to new life.  Entire societies and civilizations decay and die, and I sincerely hope that as ours follows this path it does not bring the entire ecosystem down with it.<br /><br />The music of Neurosis is dark and beautiful.  It can help us understand the necessity of social decline.  The Earth depends on it.  There is honor in the recognition that the prevailing vision of never-ending growth is impossible and should be undesirable.  Honor in being part of the process of decay that ends a cycle and makes possible the new life of the future.e more emotional, somewhere elemental.\\"<br /><br />\\"When you learn to surrender to something bigger than yourself, you're acknowledging the realm of spirit -- and where else does music come from?

B0013ND30M|4.0|Long ago in a faraway land, good King Stefan (Taylor Holmes) and his queen, after many years of hoping, welcome an infant daughter whom they name Aurora and betroth to 10-year-old Prince Philip, the son of their good friend and neighbor, King Hubert (Bill Thompson).  But on the day of the infant's christening, with nobility and the gentry in attendance to pay her homage, Maleficent, the wicked fairy, crashes the party, and, offended at not being invited, curses Aurora to \\"prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel--and die!\\"  Though the youngest of the three Good Fairies is able to blunt the curse, she and her sisters resolve to smuggle the baby away to the forest and raise her in secret, where they can keep an eye on her.  But Maleficent hasn't given up...<br /><br />Of course there'd be no story without Aurora (Mary Costa), but as a heroine she's rather ineffectual and insipid; unlike various other Disney \\"princesses\\"--Snow White, Cinderella, and Belle leap immediately to mind--she doesn't have much to do except to fall in love at first sight with Prince Philip (Bill Shirley) and fall into a magical sleep.  The story is really carried by the Good Fairies--practical Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen), slightly vague Flora (Verna Felton), and quick-tempered Merryweather (barbara Luddy)--and, as is often the case in Disney animation, by the villain, the magnificent Maleficent, self-named \\"the mistress of all evil\\" (splendidly voiced by character actress Eleanor Audley, who also did the Stepmother in [[ASIN:B00AAIHWYE Cinderella]]).  The animation is richly done (the scenes at Stefan's court are especially lavish, though Maleficent's spooky tumbledown castle in the Forbidden Mountains is equally good in its own way), and Philip's battle to reach his sleeping love--through a forest of thorns and Maleficent in the form of a dragon--is still thrilling.

B004XANKVO|5.0|I was skeptical of the price of this bag, but friends had recommended this brand to me before, and I am glad I took the plunge- this is a great backpack. I am pretty rough on bags, and this one has lasted 9 months so far and looks completely new. And this isn't just 9 months of carrying a laptop to work - I've had it loaded with camera equipment, taken it to multiple music festivals where it was sprayed with beer, sat on muddy ground, had a camelbak-style water bottle fail while inside it and soak the bag (but not the laptop compartment, thankfully!, been caught in a thundershower with no umbrella.... this bag keeps on ticking and has no tears, stains, or even smells. Whatever material it's made from gets a thumbs up from me.    The two innovations in the bag's design - the sunglasses case and the open stowing pocket - both struck me as useless when I got this, but I find I use them both alot- the stow pocket is great for beverages or things that might spill, as I learned after my above mishap - and the glasses pocket really works to protect glasses or other valuable items you access alot. It also has a hand pocket inside it for stowing train pass or other documents.    The laptop compartment is padded and includes a seperate sleeve for an iPad or other device. Handy.    The last two things I'll mention is the straps have a rigid edge to them that I thought MIGHT hurt my shoulders, but I haven't had that happen. Someone with shoulder issues might be bothered though, so check those out carefully. There is also a strap which is used to connect the two main straps together, for carrying a heavy load, I guess? It gets in my way sometimes, and I wish it were removable. Still, not a dealbreaker by any means.    This is my first Amazon review, but I was just reflecting on how useful this bag has been and how well it has held up so...    UPDATE 2-26-2015: still using this bag daily, and for trips and work assignments. It has held up great, though finally it has started to develop some mild rips and stress here and there. I normally go through backpacks in a year or less, so this one still gets GREAT marks from me.

B00AE2J5HI|2.0|The only thing holding this movie together is the acting.  Otherwise, the story is absolutely predictable, the incorporation of two love stories brings the flow of the movie to several sudden stops, and frankly, a few of the director's choices are better suited for a B horror film.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am glad we are finally seeing a well written, fully funded series coming from somewhere besides Hollywood.<br />The special effects rival anything Hollywood does and the writing and acting is on par with anything Hollywood has put out.

Finally, there is somewhere to turn other than the bloated arrogant liberal Hollywood machine.<br />To describe how good this show is, my wife hates zombie anything but she was real distraught that they ended the series temporarily.

B003V1WXKU|3.0|Mr. Feynman's exploits and anecdotes are pretty mystifying to an average joe like myself. It is clear that Mr. Feynman possessed an incredibly unique set of neural networking that made him at once &#34;accessible&#34; and &#34;ingenious.&#34; You almost get this &#34;high functioning autism/Asperger's&#34; quality to his quirks. At the same time, those quirks may have been less of a developmental origin and just the result of a mind wired completely different than the average dude. I also liked the historical perspective and how Mr. Feynman just sorta, bounced around all these groundbreaking American projects.

B00979CS50|4.0|This is a good Neil Young album. If you're a fan, then you'll like it and play it. There's no 'Powderfinger' or 'Cinnamon Girl' here, just good Neil Young music and storytelling. Some of his records are classic, and some are far from it. This goes beyond halfway. 'Walk Like a Giant' and 'Ramada Inn' are clearly the best of the lot, with 'Born in Ontario' close behind. With two discs, you get a little of everything here. Recommended.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|You can't go wrong with the original 1947 black & white and the colorized version all in one set.  Along with many special features.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Arrived on time and well packaged.  As described  and Grandson happy.  he loves Bey Blades made by Takara/Tomy Thanks for great service.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is enjoyable and its great to pass the time away especially in a doctors office.<br />It has good graffic's crisp colors and easy enough to play.
B004KKX80A|5.0|Arrived on time and well packaged.  Grandson loves and swears by this company's Bey Blades for durability. Thanks for great service.
0807208523|5.0|If you use Charlotte's Web in your classroom, this CD will be special to you. Hearing the author's voice makes it special. There's no better way to model fluent reading, than to hear it read as the author intended. Likewise, it works as a way to model &#34;Voice&#34; if you use the 6-Traits of Writing.<br /><br />Years ago I had this book on tape. The CD format makes choosing chapters and passages easy. And if you need a math lesson, students can add up all the minutes and seconds to see how long it takes Mr. White to read the whole book. (3 hrs. 34 min., This version has a wonderful 21 minute afterword not included in my classroom set of books.)
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|since the update that hit my fire last night.... thanksgiving I guess ....  game crashes any time I open store and slide screen.  fix and live.....  ignore and your off the island and uninstalled.  don't download unless frustration is the game you really wanted to play.....  I'm not about to restart
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and would recommend others to purchase it for the holiday period! It can be a great gift.
B002M87W2W|5.0|I have loved this movie for  over 50 years. It's an MGM classic and also a wonderful holiday must.<br />:-)
B004HW7JMY|5.0|I enjoyed this series a lot. The first season is great as well and would recommend both to anyone who enjoys a gladiator type story!
B005Z271Y6|4.0|This is the 3rd Royal Albert titles concert I have watched, the video on all 3 is unimaginative, but not terrible.<br /><br />Adele is a powerful singer in every respect and it comes across on the video.<br /><br />Adele knows how to play her audience, this is evident.<br /><br />Like the Sting concert, I guess the most common pronoun and adverb in the English Language is now the F bomb, at least for these two performers. I didn't get it at the Sting concert and I don't get it with Adele. Perhaps British for \\"I'm not a silver spoon?\\"<br /><br />Anyway great display of her talents, but her mouth takes away from her brilliant performance.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's Okay.  I don't have 18 more words I can say about this Ap.  Here are the six more words required.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|Celebrating 25 years of a career in the music business is for a very few artists out there.<br />And Kylie has proven herself a long lasting icon, spanning 3 decades and showing anything but improvement.<br /><br />This album is delightfully produced, Kylie's vocal completely suits this orchestra style.<br />I've been waiting for years for a Jazz Album, hopefully with the success of Abbey Road, she may consider it!
B0023SDPS6|4.0|Would like to read more with this cast of characters. Interesting people involved in interesting things.  Here are 4 more words.
B007SGM084|4.0|I liked these better than the Twilight series, which they were originally a fan fiction of.  Pretty quick and easy read.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Just getting used to my new Iphone and need to utilize the calendar and notepad more.  Here are 4 more words.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I had heard a lot of bad reviews about this movie, but honestly, I loved it!  The ending was simply wonderful and yes, unexpected.  Not earth-shattering, but just some, &#34;fill in information&#34; that will tug at your heart a little.
B002SJKWZ4|5.0|This wand is definately magic!  I surprised my husband with it and he has been smiling ever since.  The 13 commands take a little getting used to however they soon come naturally and voila!!!!<br /><br />I read a few reviews that were negative...about the construction of it and the pogramming......it is perfect, everything I expected and fun.  People are just too critical....I will ust zap them away!
B002OR0RP0|4.0|Well, the Dinosaurs are supposedly extinct, except beneath the ice.  A nice film for kids and family!  I enjoyed it very much!
0385366752|4.0|The novel is in the format of two first person narrations, one by the husband and the other by the wife, so the producers wisely chose to have the book read by a man and a woman. Both readers sound right for their characters: like young, educated, sophisticated city types. The man is good, but the woman is exceptional. She brings the character of Amy to life in a way that I wouldn't have gotten from merely reading the book. She does a wonderful job of expressing Amy's many emotions and transformations. She helps Amy to come across as likeable, lost, appealing, sassy, sardonic, crafty...and her depiction of the children's book character Amazing Amy is hilarious!<br /><br />The book starts off a little slow, but the quality of the reading made up for it. It's a long audio--18 CDs.<br /><br />I did not like the way the story ended (these characters are really screwed up). The end ruined the book for me (it's not a book I would read again). However I thoroughly enjoyed listening to most of it and could see it turned into a reader's theatre--maybe with a different ending.<br /><br />(I gave it a 4-star rating. I'd rate the story at 3-stars because of the ending, but I'd rate the reading at 5 stars)
B00479SVBU|4.0|This is a pretty low cost unit in the scheme of things.  For what it does for the price I consider it a good value.  Yes, it is a little clunky.  I had some trouble with how it organizes my music files but I have separated out the files into different folders and renamed my files to be in the appropriate order.  Once you figure out how it sorts, it's not really an issue.  For those that rely on mp3 tags for everything this could be an issue.  The remote is a little weak.  On mine, I have to hold it pretty close to the receiver to get it to pick it up.  Somewhat pointless when your hand ends up being only inches away from the device itself.  Haven't tried the USB functionality yet... just running off SD cards.  Backlit display is acceptable but nothing amazing or impressive.  For the price, this thing is a good deal and gets the job done.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|Grandson made this  right after he received for his birthday He does alot of Lego's but had never done one with a light in it. when it was all done he sent me a video of it and explained how the light worked He said it was a great gift.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. Strong characters but flawed. Connor is a strong male lead, not perfect, but wants to be. He just needed to see that what he wants is not always what's best.
B008MC175A|5.0|This a great bunch of videos for people who are X Men fans or people who just enjoy great fantasy and science fiction movies!
B000AYEL1A|5.0|It was my first film I saw as kid in the cinema. Still great entertaiment. Sadly the film isn't available in Europe on DVD. Luckily it's available in The States. Gonna watch over and over again. Best regards from the Netherlands.
1401940676|2.0|There are many splendid elements of Mrs Moorjani's work.<br /><br />* The power of love over fear.<br /><br />* Becoming aware of the \\"infinite-self\\" through unconditional self-love and acceptance.<br /><br />* The advantages of searching for answers and the truth \\"from within,\\" rather than looking exclusively to external sources.<br /><br />Also, there are many tender moments related from Mrs. Moorjani's childhood and family life, as well as poignant observations from a young woman reared within three cultures simultaneously.<br /><br />But as I listened to the last 2 CDs, it was also clear to me there are some potentially dangerous assertions that should be taken with A GRAIN OF SALT, Moorjani's bright and articulate experience in \\"the other realm\\" not withstanding.<br /><br />Several times, she suggests that those who rob, rape, abuse and prey upon others are nothing more than \\"misguided souls\\" who are more to be pitied than castigated by society.<br /><br />\\"They must be living in terrible darkness and a state of pain to perpetrate such actions.\\"<br /><br />In Moorjani's narrative, there is no acknowledgement of sin, let alone evil. Denial of sin is becoming increasingly commonplace today and is one of the calling cards of the New Age movement. Why? Because it's expedient for much of the book buying public to dismiss it, therefore the N.A. publishers keep pushing it.<br /><br />At what cost?<br /><br />Clearly (and thankfully for her) Mrs. Moorjani has never encountered the twisted souls capable of smiling while snuffing out someone's life force, followed by a nice supper and a fitful sleep. There are far too many in this world perfectly possessed by evil who live in state of calm while bent on the destruction of all those around them -- they chose evil, act accordingly and are not conflicted in the slightest. They're a far cry from the \\"spiritually illiterate\\" deserving our understanding and pity, as Moorjani intimates.<br /><br />But where I found Mrs. Moorjani's material the most dangerous is her assertion that there is \\"no judgment\\" in the other realm. In other words, Pol Pot, Hitler and Stalin get a pass in Moorjani's model. It's nice to think we can do as we please in this earthy realm, greet death with nonchalance, and then \\"enter the light\\" of the eternal stage with our deceased family members and friends sitting welcomingly in the orchestra section and cheering us on our arrival. It's convenient also to think today's transgressions are nothing more than \\"misguided thoughts.\\" Unfortunately, such a belief system may come at a high cost to our eternal souls.<br /><br />There are also several variations of the ubiquitous new age diet pill, \\"if it feels good, do it.\\"<br /><br />This is fascinating listening in many moments but it is NOT a religion and one shouldn't be tempted to draw too many conclusions about their own spiritual welfare and the after-life from it.
B0002ONAM4|5.0|This is such an amazing album! I got this thing on the wax (LP, vinyl) and it sounds so wicked. Every song is good, some more than others- but i don't find myself skipping any tracks. If you're looking to buy a Greatest Hits album by them, I highly recommend having this instead. CD, Vinyl, digital download, doesn't matter! The Pixies are one of the most influential bands of all time and I'm sure having a listen will have you thinking the same.<br /><br /> As a guitarist, I especially recommend this album- there were so many extra songs I wanted to learn upon listening to the whole thing. At one point, I'd like to be able to play every track.<br /><br />DOO (yourself a) LITTLE favor and get this perfect Pixies album!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I liked it all the way until the end...the drug lord did not follow character all the way through.  I also didn't like the way the threesome ended.

B00957T6X6|5.0|What a World! What a Story!<br /><br />How in the world did I ever miss these as they were coming out, I'll never know, but it only took me two weeks to read the first three, and I'm in the middle of book 4 now! I love it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really loved this book.  I could not put it down.  Originally I thought it was geared toward a younger audience, but I (a senior citizen) found it to be very good.  .
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love how the sounds can be meshed together. It is amazing the different combinations that can be made, and they each have a way to put me to sleep.
0307744434|1.0|After page 156 I refused to finish it. My book club selected it so the next morning my guilt won over and I decided to skim it in order to participate in our discussion. I had already figured out that the author is a visual artist who is around the age of my children, born 1977 and '79. I agree with the other one star reviews that the descriptions were fantastical and the character development and plot weak, etc. On page 233 the kiss happened. Why do editors make us wade through so much drivel toward a lame and pathetic love scene? Why weren't they childhood friends playing at birthday parties?<br /><br />I returned it to the library so I can't quote directly the outrageous hilarity on page 300 about why the dessert at the Parker House is called pie when it's cake.....never to mention Boston cream pie which was created there. When the grand explosion ended the whole plot I could only recall Like Water for Chocolate. What a way to end the contest as well as the main characters by spontaneous combustion. And who the heck cares about whether the show goes on or not?<br /><br />Because of blatant similarities to lots of other stories I tried guessing the author's source material.<br /><br />Ms. Morgenstern should paint more and write short stories or poetry.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series should never have been canceled. It is a little bit of everything and a whole lot of great.

B0098460O4|5.0|I LOVE this CD! I love that they sing in Italian, I love the chemistry they have together, love it! Charlotte's voice has definitely matured and she soars on this CD.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I have been using this app on my kindlefire and it gets the job done. I appreciate setting several seperate alarms to keep me getting to carpools for various school ages/campuses. I like that it can be set to repeat on specified days to match the kids schedules. I don't have an issue for battery drain and it functions while my KF is in suspend mode. Only complaint is that I must enter my password before being able to snooze the alarm or turn it off. Great Tool for my ADHD. Thanks.
1401937519|5.0|Seriously buy this book. It will change your life!!!<br />What an amazing journey through true knowing. Everyone can heal anything they want- just with the knowing, that's all they need!<br />Thank you!!!

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Excellent ensemble cast--great setting. They've taken what could have been a dull movie about aging people and turned it into something everyone can enjoy.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|a wonderful movie. a lesson in bullying and grownups not listening to their children. little  refernences made to certain classic horror films would suggest to kids to 12 and up.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This is another very well written and entertaining book by Best Selling author John Grisham but then this is not unexpected.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was truly caught up in the story and gratified that someone can write an amazing book without foul language and gratuitous sex on every page...just a great story that keeps you turning pages.

B0085RZGYU|5.0|There are times when you want to disappear from the world you are in and experience the fun of another life, fraught with suspense and danger, yet acting strictly as observer.  This is it!  I am an avid reader and do not stick to one category of book, so this type of book is refreshing and quick reading in a day or two.  Great for when you need a break that keeps you anxious to turn the page.<br /><br />Loved it.<br /><br />Madlyn Fafard<br />author
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like that I can easily change from one translation to another.  And I appreciate the reminders when I turn on my Kindle that spending time every day reading the Bible is important.
0451232852|4.0|Another great read.  I found it a little too descriptive at times and was anxious to move on with the story line, so that tells you the story line is captivating.  The characters themselves were captivating, their interlocking lives assisted in fleshing out the times, showing  the inter relations of so many people on the continent.  The similarity of thoughts and feelings about the First World War are not much different than the repeating time we know as the 2nd World War...and will this echo be heard for a Third World War...or are we too smart for that now?  Lets hope so.  The characters remain with you as the story ends, they are so well developed and real, you feel you know them and you understand their development over time influenced by their environment.<br /><br />Madlyn Fafard<br />author

B000002UB6|5.0|I know that &#34;Let It Be&#34; is frowned upon from Beatles purists, because it is a compiled album, and it has some deviations from the 'original' orignials.  I don't care.  This album is great.  The guitar solo of the song 'Let it be' is the best ever, and I even like the cheesy string version of 'The long and winding road'.  A matter of attitude, I guess.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|It gives me no pleasure to write this review. However, EMI and Rainbo Manufacturing predetermined its content based on the abysmal quality of the vinyl pressings of some of the finest music recorded and contained within the two box sets which I listened to with great excitement only to be followed by deep disappointment.<br />The albums were played on a more than adequate sound system, and listened to from the context of being a person who owns multiple sets of The Beatles' music ranging from UK, US, German, Japanese, Brazilian pressing plants, CDs, vinyl, stereo, mono versions, etc.<br />While the presentation and packaging was beautiful, my turntable does not play record jackets, inserts, reproduction artwork, or shipping boxes - only records.<br />To summarize the audio quality of the albums, without tediously listing each album's flaws, the majority of the pressings contained pops, non-fill, crackling, muffled and distorted tracks, smudges, finger prints, scuff marks, and warpage. Some of the spindle holes were off-center. Record labels puckered at the spindle hole and other imperfections.<br />However, there were a couple of albums in each box set which looked and played as hoped - and it was wonderful; making the lost opportunity all the more painful to hear what it could have been but was \\"almost\\" and almost does not count when it comes to a limited edition box set of The Beatles at 300+ dollars.<br />Also echoed by others, between the two sets, I could not salvage one set I could live with over time and justify its expense.<br />I returned the second set and received a refund and anticipate I will eventually purchase these titles individually over time with the hope future pressings will at minimum meet the standards of a \\"regular\\" vinyl album which will be a significant bump in quality compared to what was proffered.<br />Yes, really that bad a pressing.<br />Yes, really that good sounding Here, There, but not Everywhere.<br />For those who by chance received good sounding box sets, how I crossed my fingers I would be among you, unfortunately I was not. Happy for you - sad for me and others.<br />Trite as this sounds, shame on both EMI and Rainbo for an epic fail. Do they listen to their customers? Clearly not to their product...<br />Only buy this box set if you are feeling lucky...ed good sounding box sets, how I crossed my fingers I would be among you, unfortunately I was not.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a really good book and I still think that Jason is Better than Percy and the next book should have a chapter or three on Jason
B00AGH54XK|5.0|This show remains a classic in my Christmas library.  If you have never seen it before, be prepared for some classic slap stick.  I'm not sure people who grew up in the 2000's can appreciate this movie still but it cracks me up every year!
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Very enjoyable.  Good family movie night movie!  Both my kids enjoyed this.  Even the adults had a good time watching it!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had high expectations but I've had to start it over a couple of times because I put it aside for so long that I needed to refresh myself.  I hope I can make it through.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wish there were more and I was so disappointed that it had to come to an end.  A must read.  By the way I am 60++ and tell my &#34;age sisters&#34; to get it and enjoy it.

0525478817|4.0|Hazel is terminally ill with cancer. That her life will be short is known. What may be unknown to the reader is how cancer changes the life she has left. How do we treat a child with cancer? What happens to their friendships when they can no longer attend school? And what possibilities are there for love? This is the interesting part of The Fault in Our Stars. What I found hard to believe was the extremely witty, intelligent, older-than-their-years banter of these 16-year olds. It was funny and crackling, but didn't ring true.<br />Lisa Ard<br />Author of Saving Halloween and the Dream Seeker series
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin is one of my favourite authors and didn't disappoint with this latest offering.<br />Rebus improves with age and I enjoy the way he interacts with the other characters.
0071766588|5.0|That is okay about the product and it arrived on time.<br />I am loving the book and the audio cd.
B008HK3XU4|3.0|$25 is still expensive for a Kindle cover, but it does the job.  The ability to bend the back cover to stand the Fire HD horizontally is useful.  A slip pocket for tucking a paper note or two would have been nice.  Sometimes, opening the cover turns on the Fire, but most times, it does not.  I don't know why it does sometimes turn on.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Love the story....sort of a Raiders of the Lost Arc with books. The Google stuff was a bit cloying. Nevertheless, a good read.
B000068PQ0|5.0|There are no words to describe how amazing the Flaming Lips are....Just buy this album and it will do all the talking. You won't be disappointed!
B008NW67E0|5.0|Straightforward good music from musicians that know what they're doing and love doing it. No auto tuner, no synth pop, just love.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This was purchased as a requested birthday gift for my son.  Watched the movie and was impressed by the quality.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Love this CD.  I never get tired of Tony Bennett.  I prefer the Duet I but this one is quite good too.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|Bought this to use on a tablet to make it compatible with my desktop computer.  Can use the Word files that I transferred from my desktop computer.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Definetely in my top 10 now, It was heartbreaking. I identified with many of the characters, and could find myself yelling at them in my head to make the right desicion. The ending SO sad.
B000IZJZLM|4.0|This was purchased as a birthday gift for a friend who loves Il Divo and she is very pleased with the music.
B0009PAVI2|5.0|I am very impressed with the delivery speed and, above all, the quality of product. Nice feature on this case is it's design to attach to a pack or belt strap.. well thought out!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|WHY RIORDAN WHY? the ending was such a cliff hanger. This by far was the best book I've read from you and I say, it has to continue, even if it involve  New characters, you can never quit. I am one of your biggest fans, I've read every book of yours for children and young adults, including books away from your main stories. Keep up the Good work.
B000OIZUW6|4.0|Book was entertaining, kept my interest throughout, and lots of action.  The description of events, location, people, characters, etc. seemed like you were there.
B004EPYZT4|4.0|If you are looking for something like the books by Robert E. Howard or the Arnold movies, it will be a little disappointing  But if you want a pretty alright movie with some good special effects and a little bit of blood and sword-play then this will do the job just fine.
0762777931|1.0|How can I trust a doctor like Ornish who doesn't admit that a low or better no fat diet is unhealthy, even more when studies and researches demonstrate that the countries with the lowest heart disease are France and Italy? The Mediterranean diet has a normal percentage of healthy fats, like the ones in olive oil and fish.<br />What does he say about fish? \\"You might say, well, why not eat fish, because then you can get the fish oil directly from the fish. And you can. The problem is that the fish with the highest amount of omega 3 fatty acids are also the highest in fat and cholesterol\\"....so.....his answer is to take pills instead of eating healthy fish 3 times a week with a big salad!!!
B002U1F32M|2.0|This movie was awful. I spent the whole movie trying not to hate the main female character, only to find out in the end I might as well have hated her. It was terrible. I think even if the movie had wrapped up neatly with a happy ending and a bow I still would not have liked it because the characters were in no way likable. I couldn't even relate to them and say &#34;yeah, I might have done that too.&#34; Please don't waste your time.
B005LAII80|5.0|Dredd was a lot of fun. It was really a throwback to the best action flicks of the 80s, especially John Carpenter's Escape From New York. Karl Urban is a perfect Judge Dredd, definitely nailing the character's scowl and demeanor. The action is great and the film flies by. It's violent, funny, tense, and simple. Exactly what I want out of an action movie.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|I purchased this as a gift but, sorry to admit that, before I wrapped it, I read it. Excellent information - so much that I confessed to the recipient what I had done just so I could tell her about it. LOL
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Lots of games to play, lots of levels. Fun and entertaining and great for kindle fire! Just get it! :)
0802473156|5.0|I purchased this for a therapist friend of mine who just started working with couples. She said it was a great book with invaluable information.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not a huge follower of the horror genre, but after numerous recommendations I downloaded a copy of World War Z. Quite simply, I could not put it down. I've read other reviews that said the stories didn't seem to connect - to me, I found overlapping parallels between all the accounts, references to events that previous characters' testimonies described. I also found myself rooting for (almost) every individual, save for some of the bureaucrats and the opportunistic pharma inventor of Phalanx. At the same time, I understood why this would happen. While Zombies aren't necessarily realistic, the idea that a global pandemic could spread, partially due to government cover-up, is extremely terrifying and to me, incredibly realistic.<br /><br />I found the book overall to be thorough, well-researched, thoughtful, insightful, inquisitive, horrifying, heartbreaking, and a wake-up call all in one. I also found myself challenging previously accepted positions on information, surveillance, the penal code, and terrorism. Any fictional book that can challenge you on multiple fronts while still entertaining you and asking you to think for yourself is a novel I must give 5 stars. It's been days since I finished reading it and I'm still thinking about it.
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandson loves this - he played and played it when he was visiting from out of state and this was on our kindle. When we returned home, we deleted it because we use our Kindle mostly for business.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|excellent app. It helps. me keep in touch with everything especially the verses of the day. I strongly recommend it to anyone.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|Even though the album consists of all the tracks on his previous mixtapes, the album is still worth supporting. Bonus tracks are amazing. XO
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead, but I was really disappointed in season 2, I'm glad to see that season 3 is redeeming itself so well.
0375703764|5.0|It's tough to get into at first, but once you're in the house groove and follow the different story lines and how they switch back and forth, you will be captivated. And it will haunt you. I read it over a year ago, and still have dreams of doors appearing in my house that weren't there before. And spiral stairs.  ftairf if you will.
B009LDXQGC|4.0|The song selection is good, some great tunes by this alt group.  But I can't believe it debuts at #100 on Billboard and #93 on Amazon.  WTF????  Just four years ago they debuted a #1 album and just last year after one unsuccessful selling album they can't do any better than the top 100 for their Greatest Hits package?  Sad state of affairs for alternative music and speaks a lot about the loyalty of music fans.
B00002N9ER|1.0|I guess these were not intended for use in cold climates. Using with a Maglite 3cell light,between 20 and 40 degrees, about the third time, they broke.
0307951529|5.0|Amazon has the BEST Shipping...I received my order in ONE DAY! Awesome. This is a book worth reading if you are in an MBA program or just want to get info on start-ups!
B0000AUHPB|5.0|In some cases, the original is best. The remake of this movie is good, but bears little resemblance to the original story. Car chases, explosions, and a cameo by Benny Hill. Its a classic.
B0006J28MI|3.0|This is an ok movie but my kids have not asked to see it but once. Would not buy again
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This work has to be classified in the genre of science fiction which I rarely read. But, the previous reviews were so filled with praise and with a five star rating I was compelled to take a chance.  I bought the book and, resultantly, became estranged from my family for awhile, my nose stuck solidly in the book.  It is science fiction but no flying saucers, space aliens, or ray guns can be found.  It's about people just like us, living in a future condition.  Of course where there's people there's conflict.  I'll stop short of providing more detail.  Just buy it, enjoy it, it is a wonderfully written and intriguing book.
B003UESJHO|5.0|I had doubts about this movie because Mark's movies are so hit and miss. This was good and I would watch it again
B0026IWNZE|5.0|Even though it is a little older, it still serves as a good for young people on how to persist when you really want something. The music and dancing is entertaining also.
B004LWZW42|2.0|I am getting a bit tired of every movie series making a movie that predates the others. I know Star Wars did it, but that is George Lucas. I would not buy this again.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|...but if you don't like it, you're taking life to seriously. The fact that the writer and director played it straight makes the whole film.  Well done.
B002AS466O|5.0|If you like classic one liners than this is the movie for you. Full of action and funny at the same time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I really love this keyboard. I've installed this on three different phones after trying the stock keyboard and always go back to Swiftkey.The increasing intuitive nature is a huge plus and I really like the left swipe to errase a whole word. Worth the price.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I love this series and this version of the Batman story. I think the 2nd one is best, but this is really good.

B003O86FMW|2.0|Grate story liine. But not as good as the first book can't Waite to see movie out come of this book
B000X1T7MS|4.0|This book is written with little or no sensitivity but the contents of the book are accurate. I just wish the author wrote with a little more love.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|Men in Black Three(released May/12)stars Will Smith as Agent J,Tommy Lee Jones as Agent K,Josh Brolin as Young Agent K,Emma Thompson as Agent O,the head of MIB bureau,and many others.I found this film to be the best of the franchise yet and the biggest revelation is young Brolin who channels Tommy Lee Jones to tee.<br />The story finds the last remaining member of a race killing species,the Boglidytes,who is imprisoned on the moon,escaping from his cell and looking for revenge.He has only one good arm because his original captor,Jones,took it off apprehending him back in 1969 during the launch of Apollo 11.He plans to return to 1969 and kill the younger Jones.As Jones sits in his apartment armed and waiting for the Boglidyte to attack him,he suddenly vanishes.<br />The next day Smith shows up for work to find things have changed drastically.Jones,he learns,is not there,and in fact apparently died in 1969.Smith obtains a time travel device from an alien and travels back to 1969 in order to save his partner.He ends up at 1969 Coney Island and is just about to get his man when he is arrested by Brolin(the younger Jones).Smith obfuscates,telling all sorts of lies as to who he is and why he's there. Smith is put into a giant neural neutralizer and just as he is to get his mind totally erased,Smith finally fesses up.They must both travel to Cape Canaveral in less than six hours and defeat both the older and younger versions of the Bodlidyte.Smith takes on and defeats the present day Boglidydte while Brolin takes on and defeats the 1969 version.Just before lift off Brolin attaches a device called the Arcnet onto the conning tower of the rocket,which will activate a huge shield over the Earth,protecting it from future invasions.Smith,before returning to his proper time,learns a huge secret about his own life and how it relates to Jones.<br />This film just moves constantly,never getting bogged down in too much extraneous side plots.Brolin is nothing short of fantastic as he nailed his part as a younger Tommy Lee Jones.And the end revelation of Smith's real background really takes you by surprise when you first see it,which brings Smith and Tommy Lee's characters into clearer perspective.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There is commentary,a featurette and a gag reel.<br />In conclusion,a wild ride of a film that brings back the original duet of Smith and Jones and adds an even better third element in Brolin.I think it is the best of the franchise so far and look forward to a return of these three characters sometimes in the future.4-4 1/2 stars.nailed his part as a younger Tommy Lee Jones.And the end revelation of Smith's real background really takes you by surprise when you first see it,which brings Smith and Tommy Lee's characters into clearer perspective.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:85:1 and is clear and crisp.There is commentary,a featurette and a gag reel.<br />In conclusion,a wild ride of a film that brings back the original duet of Smith and Jones and adds an even better third element in Brolin.I think it is the best of the franchise so far and look forward to a return of these three characters sometimes in the future.4-4 1/2 stars.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Weird movie that keeps you guessing but it was good. If I had it to do again I would rent it though... no repeat value.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|well I thought only bronys got into this but this game is so freaking awesome just everything is epic. that's my review
B000SEIK2S|5.0|When a book is called &#34;Old Man's War&#34; I had to read it out of curiosity and I certainly wasn't disappointed. A great story, well written and paced, humorous and touching, an unusual slant on recruiting marines for an offworld army. I found I couldn't put it down. I'm not going to go into any more detail because the best thing you can do is ...READ IT YOURSELF!<br /><br />And as a PS I'll also say that, both follow up books from John Scalzi, 'The Last Colony' and 'The Ghost Brigades' are also great. I didn't read this series, I devoured it. Hope there's more to come.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|In short: they are indeed the best new band of the last many years.<br />Can´t say which of the 3 albuns I prefer, but this new one, Afterglow, surely is a hit, to stand through time.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I read this novel aloud to my husband on a road trip.  I loved the author's skill at layering, combining library science with current electronic media.  Great plot and characters along with humor incorporated with Mat and Neel (Matropolis and Anatomix boobs!). Very entertaining.  We both thoroughly enjoyed the span from Aldus Manutius to Google--a.k.a. immortality!  Best first novel we have read since Night Circus.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|There isn't much to say: it's the complete Beatles studio discography, in great digital audio quality (it comparable to some of their vinyls I have, and surely better then the regular mp3 - also included in the usb).<br />Amazing, amazing.<br />So so so glad I finally bought this.<br />-----<br />Update, one week later:<br /><br />Still in love. The little Apple is BEAUTIFUL and very well crafted, solid.<br />The native flash program is great. The mp3s are above average, but the FLAC files... oh my!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Very good book. Hard to get into at first, but stick with it because it's SO worth it!!  A must read
B008WCP2PG|3.0|As they say, &#34;The world is going to hell in a hand  basket.&#34; A sordid story, at best. I guess I'm old fashioned.
0596009208|5.0|I recommend this book who want to learn more about Java. We have been enjoying learning the style of &#34;Head First&#34; series. This is our 4th Head First book. I will order 2 more books this week now.
0761163808|5.0|You have to see it to believe it, it's just amazing.  Looks just as good in person if not better than on the site.  Sh... I'm giving it as a Christmas gift.  I recommend 100%
B0076DEJMO|4.0|Not as good as his previous 5 books, but still worth reading.  Good story, but the character dialog suffered I think in his attempt to do a western.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Terrible writing. Repetitive. No character development, just the same words and descriptions over and over again. Cannot read any others.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. Very good comedy, a bit of horror (zombies look realistic) and a definite romantic comedy. Simon Pegg nails it again.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|horrible movie .
B000RJO578|5.0|I LOVE this movie, and the director's commentary was pretty good too. Lots of laugh and  it got here fast.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|There was much grieving among Doctor Who fans when the series left production after Sylvester McCoy in the '90s. It is good to have The Doctor back with his classic announcement to Rose, &#34;Oh, I'm The Doctor. Run!&#34;  BBC breaks new ground with better visual and more convolouted plots. All in good fun.  Now we are coming up on 50 years of The Doctor, launched November 1963.  The Time Lord appears to be around for some &#34;time&#34; to come.
B008Z9L94O|1.0|I *really* don't like jumping on the grumpy audiophile bandwagon, but unfortunately I have to confirm that there are severe sound issues throughout the MCIS vinyl reissue.  As most people have noted, the problem is most noticeable on \\"Zero\\", where the vocal seems like it was overcooked to compensate for thinness during the \\"emptiness is loneliness\\" part and then left that way throughout the rest of the song.  (Apparently someone thought that those of us willing to spend $75 on a 17-year-old Pumpkins record don't already know that Billy Corgan has a thin voice.)<br /><br />One theory I've heard is that the problem is actually a pressing error affecting sound closest to the center of the disc. I hear a biiiit of distortion on the drums toward the end of \\"To Forgive\\" but nothing as bad as \\"Zero\\" so I kind of doubt that this is the case, but I don't know much about vinyl pressing so I wouldn't know what to listen for.  At any rate, while \\"Zero\\" is the worst of the lot, there is plenty of clipping, fluttering, and stereo weirdness to go around.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong: I was not expecting perfection.  MCIS has always sounded weird to me.  It is clearly an album worked on by multiple producers and mixers in different studios under different conditions, leading to a ton of inconsistencies in volume and EQ.  However, aside from a lot of the guitar sounds being a bit digital and warbly, I never felt that anything really sounded outright bad.  Sadly, this version does.<br /><br />At $75 a pop, there is really no excuse.  I'm hoping it is a pressing plant issue, and that these are not the final masters Corgan signed off on.  In any case, I'm returning my box tomorrow.  It's a real shame because I've wanted this on vinyl for years.
B007BVMVDU|3.0|The video was quite choppy when i was streaming it on my laptop at home on very high speed internet.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My preschool niece (almost 3) got the hang of most of the activities, though a few required some adult help or suggestion. I like that the app is just fun activities with no \\"learning agenda\\" about numbers/shapes/colors etc. - just fun activities and little puzzles.
0300169787|5.0|Beautiful book with outstanding essays on McQueen.  The photographs of McQueens designs are exquisitely done and the evolution of his work over time is chronicled in a wonderful manner.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Got this for my daughter. We saw the movie and she has wanted it ever since. She is getting other Brave items. This was well packaged, came promptly and was exactly as described.
B0063IH60K|3.0|A difficult game to win.  Haven't played this in a very long time.  Will try to give it more tries.
030759565X|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend because she loves the blog, it did not disappoint.  The instructions are clear, her writing and anecdotes are amusing, and the pictures are beautiful.  I like how most recipes do not call for uncommon or expensive ingredients.  She also tries to conserve dishes so you don't have too many dishes to do afterwards.
B004U52VPS|5.0|I have two boys (20 months old and a 4 years-old). I got this as a birthday present. My kids loved the game, also older cousins and friends (from 20 months to 11 years-old).
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This story kept you guessing all the way through, loaded with description.  Kept your interest right up to the end
B0063IH60K|5.0|Fun to play, easy to lose track of time! Good while waiting at the doctors or when you just need to unwind.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|I will order this again. It came in three days!! My  husband loves this movie. The Perfect Christmas Gift! Yippee.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and every song on it! Some I favor more than others, like California King, Whats My Name and the second part of I Love the Way You Lie. But Man Down is great and I love her swag on this CD! Definitely shows a lot of confidence and bravado!
B005LAII8A|5.0|LOOPER IS QUITE A HIGH-OCTAINE ACTION PACK SCI-FI THRILLER THAT TAKES YOU TO ANOTHER WORLD OF TIME TRAVELING. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE ACTOR BRUCE WILLIS IS PLAYING THE OTHER HERO ALONGSIDE JOSEPH. I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW AMAZED I WAS WITH THE STORY AND BRUCE'S ROLE WAS SPECTACULAR AS THE FUTURE ASSASSIN WHO WAS SENT BACK TO KILL HIMSELF. I KNOW IT SOUNDS TOTALLY CONFUSING AND THAT'S WHY IS BETTER TO JUST BUY THE MOVIE AND WATCH THIS THRILLER GET INTO YOUR HEAD AND AMUSE YOU FROM START TO FINISH. LET THE BLOOD IN YOUR VEINS GET A GOOD RUSH ONCE YOU START YOUR NEW YEARS BY TIME TRAVELING WITH THESE GUYS!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I haven't had a chance to watch the blu-ray version of this DVD but since I watched it at the movie theatre, I'm expecting it to be of similar quality and viewing experience.  Anyways, the packaging of these DVDs are presented in a beautiful display and includes all the relevant stuff you'd actually use while not including the other crap.  Got it during black friday so the price was about half what you would expect to find in the stores.
B004FOA84A|2.0|DO NOT waste your money on this one!!! Read the other reviews. HEED the other reviews. It's a good game, terrific graphics, just difficult enough to keep you interested but Lord in Heaven it's TOO SHORT!!! I finished the game in under an hour. Saw the grandpa sitting there and was like, \\"What? Surely this is just the gateway to PART II!!!\\" When the credits started rolling. I gave it the extra star because it IS a good game. Just...dangit...too short!
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this game on my grandchildrens IPad and it's fun to play.  Works good on the new Kindle Fire HD too!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this back in late June/early July of 2012.  I'm a person who hasn't really worked out in over a decade since I stopped playing football in college.  I was terribly out of shape.  My problem?  Between work and children, I simply do not have the time to devote to spending over an hour working out.  It was always my belief that a person needed to devote that kind of time in order to get in shape and see a difference in their bodies. Enter &#34;30 Day Shred.&#34;<br /><br />I read the reviews here on Amazon, and decide to take the plunge.  I figured that worst case scenario, I get in better shape, even if I don't necessarily look it.  Anything is better than nothing right?  And for the cost of this DVD?  There was NOTHING to lose and EVERYTHING to gain.  I started with the level one workout back in early July.  Watching it, it didn't seem to difficult, but let me tell you, for someone like me who was totally out of shape, it was!<br /><br />Here's the thing- It's now December, and guess what? I'm STILL doing level one.  Why?  Because I push myself to my physical limit.  Every day.  Every workout.  There's has been no need at all for me to switch up the routine.  In spite of the fact that the workout is only around 25 minutes with the warmup and cooldown, I have seen a dramatic change in my body.  I've lost my gut, and lovehandles.  I have abs!  Ones I can actually see!<br /><br />For me there has been a few keys to success:<br /><br />1. Do the workout everyday if you can.  I've do it almost everyday.  On average, I've probably missed one or two days per month, simply because I listen to my body, and if I'm that physically exhausted, I give it rest, however, like I said, I only do it once or twice a month, if that;<br />2. DO NOT SLACK OFF when doing the workout.  Like Jillian says, it's a short workout so you need to push yourself.  For example, I do 3 jumping jacks for every two the models do; During each 30 second punching portion of cardio, I do anywhere from 50 to 60+ punches.  You can do it too, you just have to will yourself to do so, even on days where you're tired and you're not in the mood to move, let alone workout.  No one can make you push yourself but you, and when we're talking about a measily 25 minutes of your day, there's no excuse to not do it;<br />3.  You obviously need to eat better.  What I've done is cut out the white carbs from my diet as much as possible, and I try to avoid sugars and carbs when I can.  I still eat them, don't get me wrong- and your body needs them, just try and eat brown cabs with fiber when you can.  Yes, I eat pizza, ice cream, and candy, but I don't do it everyday, and pig out.<br /><br />I'm so happy with the success I've had doing 1/3 of this inexpensive, 25 minute workout DVD.  I don't know how much weight I've lost, but I definitely have, as I've gone from 36 inch waist to about a 31 inch waist, where I can see my abs- something I didn't think would be possible in my lifetime, and something that was never an expectation I had going into this.  If I knew I could invest such little time and get such great results, I would have done this YEARS ago.  I believe in this workout so much I went ahead and bought another copy for my parents and I'm convincing them to do the modified exercises, and do what they can because anything is better then nothing.  If you get this DVD good luck with it.  Follow my advice and you will see results.
0446572764|5.0|I was on the edge of my seat from page one to the end. Good history, great mystery, flows like Niagara Falls. This is the kind of book to take on a trip (like a cruise) where you can chill out and just get into it.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I love Alicia Keys Great album only wished it came in a hard cover other that .. great product and great music
B008DM4OTA|1.0|Any app that bills itself for preschool children should not have in-app access to the web or to buy new apps.  This game has buttons for both that cannot be disabled or removed.  My child repeatedly got out of the game and ended up in the app store or on the company's website.  Very poor design.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|acts like a champ on rooted ICS 4.0.4 ..but its DI Radio, what else would you expect. This svc rocks.
B0079K4WEE|1.0|Due to the positive reviews I went ahead & watched this & all I can say is im thrilled so many did like it but I personally HATED it. It was rather boring & depressing.<br /><br />I kept watching & waiting for it to get better but it just never happened for me.<br /><br />I wanted to change the channel numerous times but kept forcing myself not to since the positive reviews gave me hope that if I kept watching, I would be glad I did.<br /><br />It just never happened & again, all I can say is glad others liked it but I would rate it negative stars if I could.<br /><br />Just horrible IN MY OPINION..but different strokes for different folks is always the rule. Obviously some liked it based on the reviews, but I thought it was one of worst movies I have ever watched & actually wished I had not wasted 1 second on this trash.<br /><br />But, I do rec folks watch it themselves & form their own opinion.
B00A6N7BS0|4.0|Watched this solely because Oliver Stone directed it and it starred Bencio Del Toro.  Nice to see Oliver making good, entertaing movies again; already recommended it to five other folks.
1609419693|5.0|Tina Fey is amazing. The audio version has some added commentary (I have the book too). I highly recommend it!!!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Well done; Josh Brolin was an excellent younger Tommy Lee Jones.  Well-paced and entertaining, I actually liked it better than MIB2; really liked how it looped back.
B00684J49U|5.0|It's awesome! Just the season finale is fantastic! If you love Grey's Anatomy then you should buy the seasons on DVD or Instant watch!
B009VB97EY|3.0|The men dancing were gorgeous, but it wasn't much of a story and had too much moralizing to make it a good movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I have had a blast so far! I do recommend this game if you like SIM CITY. It's a good past time on the road.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This CD is great to jam to, but not suited for kids.  I would recommend this if you're a fan of Eminem or for a friend.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved the way the author went from the past to the present & back. Really kept my interest and made me want to read another book by this author.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game, there are levels that my 7 year old sister can play and there are levels that I can play that are challenging for me. This is a family game.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|As previous MArware products, good strong case inspires confidence that would be good protection for small falls, would give 5 stars but didn't find it easy to use as a stand, instruction diagrams a bit vague.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are, you'll love this episode. In fact, you'll love the whole series. This is an awesome show, very well done.
B00846REIS|3.0|It's a good book to read ... If you love 50 shades you'll like this book. The story line almost identical.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Amazing sixteen songs, Keane is back to their senses  - what made them great in the first place. Easy wonderful  purchase
B008QMMEOE|5.0|I downlowded the free version for my 2yr old son who loves trains ...after a few days of doing the choochoo puzzles he discovered the boats and planes so I downloaded the full version. I think it was def worth the money to have all the puzzles. The app is easy to use and keeps the attention of my busy boy :) He loves being able to do it himself. The celebration upon completion of the puzzles is a good reward for a job well done,  and what child doesn't love bubbles and balloons. I would recommend this app for anyone with a child that loves puzzles :)
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My husband and I really loved this book, helped us after almost 25 yrs. of marriage. Have sent books to some of our children.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I just started reading this book but I like it already.  I have loved the earlier books and can't wait to get into this one more.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler is just a joy to listen to...and I can never get enough. Will miss him on tour this time...but can't wait til the next.
0553108034|5.0|Love it.  It was so well written I had a hard time putting my kindle down. Even when I was tired and sleepy I kept trying to read.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I truley enjoyed this series more than Fifty Shades of Grey. It was nice to get to the female lead in more detail.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Absolutely loved this book.  So far this is the best from the series.  Well written and kept me on edge the whole time.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved it!!! I actauly prefered this to Fifty Shades of Grey!!!<br />Loved that you get know more about her than him in the novel.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|really good movie. watched it dozens of times already. saw it in the theatre, couldn't wait for it to come out
B003VB5E2E|5.0|can't go wrong with a line up like this. if you like guitar this is for you. stereo or surround it all sounds great
B0085HWZ9Y|5.0|I went to this show on a last minute invitation from a friend, and was totally blown away by how good everything was.  From the reimagined Zep classics to the flawless harmonies with the seductively undulating Patti Griffith, to the &#34;how does he make that sound&#34; guitar pyrotechnics of Buddy Miller, it was ALL GOOD and way beyond my expectations.  Robert Plant has continued to re-invent himself since the halcyon days of Led Zep, and I just love it.  BUY IT NOW.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Santa has scored another perfect Christmas Eve and is back at the North Pole to rest.  But wait!  A toy has been overlooked and not delivered!  Who will save the day?  Can Arthur, Santa's sweet but bumbling son, do it?<br /><br />I loved everything about this movie.  The animation is bright and beautiful, the script is witty, the pacing is quick, and it all ends happily.  Children will love seeing Santa, the reindeer, and sleigh (even though he usually drives a solar-powered spacecraft aided by a NASA-like control room manned by elves) and adults will laugh nonstop at the very funny dialogue that combines traditional values with modern technology.  Turn on the subtitles to catch them all.<br /><br />The British cast features James McAvoy, Bill Nighy, Hugh Laurie, and Jim Broadbent and is outstanding.  I was left with a big smile on my face.

B008KEA6ZM|5.0|Streetcore is as good as anything The Clash ever put out, and is better than some of the titles they put out.  While it doesn't rock as hard ALL THE TME as &#34;Give 'Em Enough Rope&#34; or &#34;London Calling&#34;, it does have solid rockin' tunes like &#34;Coma Girl&#34;, and what makes it special are the more &#34;mature&#34; songs that he pairs the rockers with.  His take on Redemption Song is said to be essentially a demo, but you can tell when you listen that the man OWNED that song.  Joe Strummer was the heart and soul of The Clash, and one listen to this disc will convince you that it was the best thing he did in his solo career, as well as ONE OF the best discs he ever put out.  BUY THIS CD.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|First person narrative gets a bit tedious after a while.  Interesting concept.  Well rounded characters.  A bit too predictable for my tastes.
B008SVS3FC|4.0|John Hiatt surprised me with how hard this disc rocks!  I gotta hand it to the guy - he's many, many albums into his recording career (and I own almost all of them) and he still finds a way to kick out the jams.  This is a must buy for Hiatt fans, and would be a good late career introduction for new fans, who could then work their way back to some of his other classic titles.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|It is a great movie, keeps you wondering what is to come next all thru the movie.  Can't wait for a sequel.
B00979CS50|3.0|I've heard this all before many times.  Don't get me wrong - it's OK - but it doesn't have the impact of a Ragged Glory or Re-Ac-Tor.  I dunno - maybe it didn't catch me at the right time.  Nevertheless, as a hard core Neil Young & Crazy Horse fan, I HAVE TO have it, so I got it.  Maybe it will grow on me later (I hope)
0385535147|3.0|I agree with others who think Grisham's best wrting is in the past. That's not to say it can't return but this book is not on par with his best. The writing is still crisp and straight forward. However, chapters 24-36 (about 100 pages) could have been edited to exclude half to 2/3 of the content and still maintained, perhaps enhanced, the energy and page-turning of the beginning and end.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this calendar/note pad.  I constantly use it to remind me of appointments and also as a shopping list at the grocery store.  No longer do I have to use paper/pen and then forget my list before shopping.  I never, ever, leave home without my Kindle Fire HD.
B005LAIHZE|1.0|I wanted to watch this on my lap top on a recent business trip, but the Blu-Ray Digital Restriction software on this disc seems to cause issues with the playback.  I was able to watch another movie, so I know it wasn't the player.  Later when trying it out at home, same issues.  I've not been able to actually watch the movie yet.  Normally I'd think it was a scratched disc or something but it won't even try to load the menu or allow me to see the scenes.  I'll be trying to return the movie cause it's pretty useless.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Living in the mountains of Utah where the weather can change quickly, I rely on current accurate weather reports.  This application is right on!
0525478817|4.0|It had been so long since I added this to my \\"to read\\" list that I had utterly forgotten the plot by the time I actually got it from the library. Hazel is a typical angsty 16-year-old, except that at age 13 she was diagnosed with thyroid cancer. However, a miracle drug has extended her life but she must live with the knowledge of her eventual death hanging over her. Enter Augustus, an equally angsty teenager who has lost his leg to cancer but is currently in remission. Despite his drop-dead-gorgeous looks, Hazel finds herself on his radar, and thus begins their love story.<br /><br />The good: Even though I had some issues with the characters (see below), I was still drawn to finding out about them. They definitely sucked me into their world and their relationship. It was a good example of a character-driven novel done right. I've never read anything by Green before, but really enjoyed his writing style. It was compelling and somehow moved quickly while meandering. By the end he actually managed to make me cry; this may have been more related to having just attended in August the funeral of a 10-year-old girl who lost her battle with a brain tumor and was a close family friend.<br /><br />The bad: I dinged it a star because I'm not sure this actually brought anything new to the genre. Apart from their diseases, the characters were all typically snarky teenagers, and I didn't feel like he was making a point with this fact. On top of that, they all acted like they were at least in their 20s. Again, not because having such a heavy burden had brought about maturity. It was definitely distracting.<br /><br />Red flags include strong language, death, and a glossed-over sex scene.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I downloaded it for a friend's child to play on my kindle while at the coffee cafe.  It took a little time to download, but I find I'm playing the game till wee hours of the morning.  Very addictive, and not very forgiving!  That's why I love it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think this game is a fun way to pass the time. My children love it and play it in the car on long road trips.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|When one is retired, one doesn't pay too much attention to alarm clocks.  This is my back up that I rely on especially when I'm out of town and use it as a wake up call.  Works great!
B0065CCM76|5.0|This is a great compilation of hits. I have always enjoyed Bob Seger and this has most of his greats!  really enjoy listening to it.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|I've tried loading this application on my kindle fire HD, but I'm not sure it has totally downloaded.  Hopefully, it will.

B009NPA3Q4|5.0|This is one of those CD's that you can listen to the whole thing without skipping a song!  Everyone in the family loves it.
B000AM2L1O|3.0|I was looking for a baby doll made in the USA.  This item came up in the search.  But it is made in China.  Very cute doll but not USA made as I wanted.  No packing slip in the box so it's tuff to return
B003X27L9U|5.0|Surprisingly powerful, considering that the voice of the book throughout is that of a five-year old boy. I found myself drawn into his world from the first page - a world that one could only previously have imagined but that became almost tangible as the book progressed. Sensitive and insightful, it gripped me to the end and dealt equally well with psychological trauma, and the healing that followed. Any mother would empathise.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this game. You can build anything you want in creative mode and fight monsters and craft stuff in survival you can get gold diamond Iron Flint... Also in survival you can use chest and Crafting boxes and you are able to have more stuff in survival... a lot more stuff.but I think you should totally get the app
B0055SWM08|4.0|I love logic puzzles... works fine on my kindle fire so far. I have found the levels pretty easy ... we'll see!
B0064ORVCQ|2.0|This review is for the 3D version of Deathly Hallows pt. 1. This review is only for the 3D effects.  If you liked the Harry Potter movies, then you should like this movie.  My complaint is that the movie was obviously not filmed in 3D.  The conversion from 2D to 3D has added some depth to many of the scenes, but there are no scenes where anything jumps off the screen at you.  I have Avatar, Green Lantern, Mysterious Island 2, and Journey to the Center of the Earth all in 3D and those movies have numerous excellent scenes where 3D effects are amazing.  There are times in them that makes one want to duck or blink one's eyes.  There are no such scenes in this 3D version of Deathly Hallows 1.  Really disappointed in the 3D effects.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Sorry to hear these books are being marketed to children. Kids killing kids should not be what we encourage our children to read
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Good show and fun subjects. Great take on good versus evil in a fun storyline.  Can't wait to watch the rest of season 2.
B003O86FMW|4.0|My only problem is the fact that books with kids killing kids is being marketed to chidren, In schools. Very good writnig ablity. It was like watching a train wreck. Did not want to see it happen, but could not look away.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Gran articulo. Una gran calidad de acabados, el envio fue perfecto, dentro del tiempo previsto.<br />Y a un buen precio, embalaje perfecto.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Works great!  Fits the Baby Jogger and my Bob strollers perfectly.  Holds  a lot and is pretty sturdy.  Thank you!
B006LSZECO|4.0|The advantage of being sick is when Tv makes you crazy reading still offers up a snuggled safe escape. This book ties your stomach in knots.
B000WTXD30|5.0|Great collection! All of the good songs are on this. Not that the rest aren't good, it's just that this is a great collection.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|A clear and concise telling of the actions of Wall Street investment bankers gam<br />bling with complicated and fabricated investment devices. It should be required viewing for all Americans, and if enough people saw it we could probably support recall movement for all of Congress and the Executive Branch. Investment bankers with multi million dollar earnings almost brought the entire economy down with their money grubbing desire for more money forcing the federal government to almost bankrupt the country to avoid a total economic collapse. And the average American is still suffering with major job losses and retirement plan losses while these high rolling gamblers in the investment banks have walked away from it all unhurt with pockets full of money. All clearly detailed in this DVD.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I don't usually spend this much on Kindle books but this one was worth the price. Historical fiction is my favorite genre. Well written with interesting plot development.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Had minor scratches on it, but it played.  I was still able to enjoy the movie.  My 10 year old daughter has watched it more than 10 times, since I purchased it.
B00AFS5PCU|2.0|This drivel has set the performing arts back to just after the discovery of \\"fire make shadow on cave wall\\".<br />One would have to have some pretty amazing powers of imagination to conjure up anything in this series that<br />could be compared to a Sherlock Holmes mystery.  This is about as entertaining as prefabbed particle board and<br />not nearly as tasty.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|There are few shows that are this entertaining!  It follows the books enough, but has made good changes that make it a show all of its own.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie and the actors.  Lots of action from the very beginning of the movie.  Glad I purchased.
B008SOS63S|5.0|Joe is truly amazing and this group of songs doesn't fail to be pleasing.  He is so passionate about his music and has an incredible ability to bring out the best in all his guitars, bringing them to life like nobody else.

0156027321|5.0|When I first heard of the film adaptation of `Life of Pi', I had no idea of the subject.  All I knew was that there was a tiger and a boy on a boat and apparently the novel was deemed `unfilmable'.  Now, I have seen the film, and it pales in comparison to the novel, so in a way I completely agree with that assessment of the book.  While one can certainly capture the physical presence of the story (those effects were stunning to watch), one cannot truly capture the delicate transference of emotional progression that is experienced while reading this novel.<br /><br />The novel is, in a word, a masterpiece.<br /><br />Telling a very compelling, heart-breaking and life affirming story, `Life of Pi' tells of Pi Patel's journey of self-discovery and survival as he is left to fend for himself while floating for 227 days in the middle of the ocean with only a Bengal tiger as a companion.  Yes, after the boat he is on sinks and his family is killed, Pi boards a lifeboat that also contains four live animals (Pi previously lived on a zoo and he was traveling with his family to America, transferring animals to a zoo in the states), an orangutan, a zebra, a hyena and a tiger.  Soon, after much bloodshed, there only remains Pi and the tiger.  While the initial scenario seems dire indeed, time is kind to Pi and soon he strikes a rather odd friendship, companionship as it may, with the tiger (named Richard Parker).  While fishing for food, fending off sharks, suffering starvation, discovering new islands, establishing barriers and fighting hopelessness, these two form a bond that cannot be expressed in a mere review.  You'd have to read it to believe it.<br /><br />What impressed me most about Martel's fantastic prose was the way that everything seemed so complete without ever being conclusive.  Once can read the novel without every drawing concrete conclusions and yet you will still be uplifted in a way that is unexplainable.  The core of the prose is undoubtedly about faith and the reason that faith in `something' is so important to survive.  At the outset we are informed that this is a story that will make you believe in God, and that is such a true statement, but not in the literal sense of the statement.  You see, whether you believe in God or not, the essence of what God stands for (faith) is relayed with such undeniable conviction that you cannot help but be consumed by its power.  As Pi recounts his tragic tale and then, in heartbreaking realism, spins it another way, we are left with a fuller understanding of the meaning, and saving grace, of faith.<br /><br />Seriously, which story do YOU prefer?<br /><br />Without a doubt, `Life of Pi' is a masterwork of fiction, a novel that transcends boundaries and carries a weight that is often shied away from in popular fiction.  Martel took on a pretty hefty responsibility.  Religion, or spirituality, is not a subject many take lightly.  Martel doesn't either, but this `fable' of sorts could have easily veered into the wrong direction.  Instead, Martel weaves a perfectly balanced and beautifully realized web of truth and honesty in a palatable and powerful way.  It's unlike anything I've ever read before it, and I have a feeling it will remain unlike anything I read afterwards.the reason that faith in `something' is so important to survive.

B009E3EY38|4.0|This set has a blue ray DVD of the concert, the picture is sharp and it sounds good.  The CD's that come with it have a lot of bass.  The DVD of the rehearsal is also very entertaining.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|I may not be the perfect person to judge a `Terminator' movie.  I find the original overrated, despite claims by so many that it is a classic.  On the other hand, I find `Judgment Day' to be one of the best action films ever made.<br /><br />Go figure.<br /><br />I walked into `Salvation' with a lot of high hopes.  I love Christian Bale.  I think he is one of our finest working actors and so I was intrigued to see what he was going to do with this franchise.  I was also really interested to see more of Sam Worthington.  While I found `Avatar' an overrated mess, I really thought Worthington was a star in the film and wanted to see more of him.  Despite the fact that I tend to gravitate to more Oscar fare when it comes to my movie watching, I do like to indulge in mindless action fodder from time to time, so this seemed like a nice way to kill an evening.<br /><br />Sadly, it killed it in all the wrong ways.<br /><br />The story is boring and convoluted and just plain messy by the end and the action scenes, while engaging, aren't enough to carry the weight of the film.  Bale is awful here, the progression of the film is dull and disengaged and the end result is far too unrealistic to support the development of the series.  I mean, you need to sustain a particular narrative that has been maintained for three feature films now, and `Salvation' drops the ball and winds up being forgettable.  Worthington is the only reason to see the film.  He proves yet again that he is a force to be reckoned with.  Sadly, his star isn't rising like it should be, but I have hope for him yet.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very fun and addicting. Coins regenerate slowly over time but you<br />are able to play with a full count twice per day. Very enjoyable.
B007VYQ9G2|2.0|National Geographic films were a staple in my house as a child.  I belonged to that monthly program where a new one was shipped to my house regularly and I indulged in whatever wildlife adventure was laid before me for that month.  I ate them up and loved every second of it.  When `Chimpanzee' was released I was excited.  My wife was excited.  My kids were excited.<br /><br />I was disappointed.<br /><br />My problem with `Chimpanzee' is that, at the end of the day, it all feels so pointless.  The story concocted by the producers to make this more `compelling' is just not that captivating and at times becomes a burden on the film itself.  Creating a story with cartoonish names (Scar) and making them a pivotal role in the film took away from what could have been something truly beautiful.  Instead, it all felt so forced and unnecessary.  Yes, the story involving little Oscar is sweet (tragic in parts and heartwarming in others) but by the time the film was finished I found myself wishing it had been more straightforward and less intent on trying so hard to make this a `story'.  It really defeats the whole purpose of watching these animals in their natural environment.  Instead, you have a rather contrived `plot' laid out by Tim Allen in a way that is stiff, unnatural and awkward in parts.<br /><br />They just tried WAY TOO HARD.<br /><br />The cinematography is nice, but the overall effect is uninspired, clich&eacute;d and sadly forgettable.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|This movie has something for everyone - it's a must watch every year at Christmas. Also a great gift idea.
B005K17RU0|4.0|i like it, except i can not figure out how to delete a location, which is very frustrating.  anyone know what to do?
B0015GDVTU|5.0|I laughed and cried and thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Great movie for a girls night or for the young girl (duaghter, Niece, etc.) in your life. Add it to your gift list.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Very Good Movie! Loved the first and knew my husband and I would love the second one! He's getting both for Christmas
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Slow start but then WOW!  Kept your interest to the end and wanting to read the next book and the next.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|When I seen the movie on the big screen it was ok, but didn't stand out. I think maybe I was just too set with the old stars and the rewrite/reboot didn't set well in my stomach. I was in the mood for some J.J.Abrams directing and seen this listed. Thought I would give it a second watch. I was really drawn into it, and had a better feeling for the cast. Ok maybe Chris Pine needed to take his meds and stay away from coffee in a few scenes, but he looks the part of a young Kirk.<br /><br />I think anyone reading this has already seen the movie. If not it is a good watch. You do not have to be a fan of the TV shows to know what is happening. As a reboot it starts at the beginning, everything you need to know is there. Your in the future, there is space travel, and something bad happens that causes the characters to join in the adventure. For old timers and TV watchers like me, the future was changed because someone came back in time and changed it. THAT is the essential part you have to understand. Yes it wasn't like that, because something bad happened, now it is. Sinple as that.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read to get the full story!  Can't wait for the movie.  Hope it is better than the first movie.  It should be, if it follows the book.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|The movie is great, but since I don't have the Kindle with 3G I have to wait till I have wifi to watch it. If it could be downloaded to watch anytime, that would be better.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|A dying man's outlook on life and his gift to a special friend.<br />We can all benefit from reading this book.<br />Easy read!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love the cross platform functionality; Kindle Fire, phone, computer, etc. Fast to sync is nice too. Also, adding files and pica and being able to share them...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great follow up to Book 1. You must read this to find out what happens next. Then you will need to read the conclusion
0547884591|4.0|Yes, the Kindle version is much lighter. Yes, with Kindle books can share highlights. Kindle books also have a lot of other positive aspects like active internet links and all that. In this case the formatting of the kindle version didn't translate as well as with the hardcover version of the 4 Hour Chef's layout of this book. I felt the hardcover version was simply wonderful! But I will say it's also a really big and heavy book. As a Kindle user lugging around a big heavy books can be a bit of a chore and it was nice to be able to click on the many active links and videos and return back to reading the electronic Kindle version.<br /><br />Personally I bought both... the Kindle version and the hardcover version of the 4 Hour Chef. I have to say, \\"I really like this book.\\" The Hardcover version is just WONDERFUL to read. The formatting doesn't transfer to the Kindle version as well and why I'm giving a rating of 4. Both are good and I am glad I bought both (I bought the kindle version after I started reading the hardcover version) due to the heaviness of the book and being able to click on the many active links in the Kindle version.<br /><br />Also, I have to say... cooking isn't my thing. Yes, I did really like the advice for learning anything, and this is why I bought the book... For me the first 100 pages really ROCKED! The rest of the book \\"helps\\" reinforce these principles and concepts and it was still written in a way I found as an interesting reading using cooking as a method of exploring these concepts. Yes, I truly believe my understanding and even my cooking abilities have improved simply by reading this book and have used many of the tips. Although not wanting to practice the cooking aspect deeply I'm still not much of a cook... there are so many other aspects to this book I found tons of stuff that loved exploring and practicing.<br /><br />All in all... I think this is a good and enjoyable book. The hardcover version is beautiful and it was a joy to hold in my hand, to read and go back too. Yes, the Kindle version is lighter and easier to carry around with me and I am glad I bought it due to the heaviness of the hardcover version... although the formatting of the hardcover book didn't translate as well to the Kindle version. All in all a solid 4 RATING and both the Kindle or Hardcover versions are worth buying... If I could only buy one I'd get the hardcover version. Having both I found very useful as the Kindle version did give me access to active links and I enjoyed the hardcover for the wonderful and beautiful formatting and layout. I hope this helps and you find this review useful.ld in my hand, to read and go back too.

1601251505|5.0|Okay keep this just a short, and simple deal. I am a very old school gamer. I have always had a difficult time with new games I lijed as I am a GM. This game is fun, and you have so many options for the game it's awesome!
B009FZFONO|4.0|The title says it all. We just now entered the mid season break and I must say that I am anticipating the final 8 episodes for this season. The story pacing is 10x faster than season two (STUFF ACTUALLY HAPPENS). We finally get fan favorite characters appearing this season. 4 words: DARYL IS THE MAN. Norman Reedus's character once again proves he is the most useful character of the group. Of course there are gripes, like how dangerous it must be to be a black character surrounded by white people and zombies. Also, David Morrisey's take on the infamous Governor will rub some of the comic fans the wrong way,..then act like he is supposed to, then randomly change.<br /><br />Other than the gripes, The Walking Dead season 3 is a breath of fresh air that was the stagnant previous season. Enjoy it!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|love it so much it really entertains me and if you don't like the hidden object scenes you can play mojong instead
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|If you have ever played the Strike Fighters series of PC games, you will recognize a lot of what you see here.  Lots of aircraft to eventually choose from, some of which have never been brought to life by any other air combat game developer.  Though combat is strictly air to air, you find some strategy involved, especially employing missiles properly.  The Kindle version of this app is optimized with better resolution textures compared to the plain old Android version.  In summary, no air to ground missions or threats (bummer), but a variety of aircraft to fly and some strategy required for missile combat.<br /><br />Update for April 2013:  I recently switched over to a Kindle Fire HD, and I wanted to start over to see the changes to the app since it first came out.  Most changes were bug fixes,  aircraft addons, and rudder controls.  Later aircraft dogfights are balanced verses the original 10+ on 1 that would happen.<br /><br />One thing I wanted to test was if you have to buy an aircraft at some point.  I have not seen this at all.  I played through the whole campaign, and afterwards, continuing to earn points to earn keys to unlock aircraft...all for free.  I have not reached a point where I have to pay to play or get more aircraft....all aircraft for all years are available to unlock...no money needed.  I'm wondering if some people don't understand the full unlock mechanic...realize that as you earn more points, each additional key will take more and more  points to earn.
B005TD4GTO|5.0|If you are an Oasis or Jam fan this is a must buy.  Just an all around Brit Pop.  Sorry I missed seeing them live.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Arrived fast, on time, and it does the job of protecting the Kindle Fire from dust and such. Highly recommend it!
B0030B624E|5.0|Not only has this movie raised the bar for zombie film makers everywhere, it has become a necessary and imperative guide for surviving the inevitable Apocalypse, and THIS movie is the one to convert all your non zombie loving movie friends! Best cast ever, witty humor (Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson, need I say more?), creative filming, and constructive, numbered tips on survival that will stick with you. This is one of the first movies in a while (along with The Goods, and HotTub Time Machine) inspiring me to purchase and re-watch for the quotes about a million times. Please prepare for the end.... entertain your family and I SWEAR they'll be Zombie obsessed too.
1594744769|5.0|I liked this book a lot.  It was different without being absurd or unbelievable. The photos in the book are fabulous!
B006POGWHK|1.0|The DVD I was sent was the non-US version, so I couldn't view on my DVD player.  Not a happy camper!
0385535147|4.0|Good book, not one of Grisham's best, but it has a nice twist to it.  All of his books are easy to read.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was a good humorous storyline. It showed that not every \\"mistake\\" has to be grave.  And, it was well edited and written. Nice!
1451627289|4.0|King's book involves the supernatural without the violence and gore found in some of his other books.  Quite interesting on the whole.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Cheap, predictable plot which could've taken an interesting turn or two in a couple of places but didn't, and the back-and-forth narrative at the end was like death by a thousand papercuts.  I kept thinking, \\"end already!\\"  I was foolishly hoping the much-touted twist would come on the last page, but no luck.  The characters weren't particularly interesting, either.  Blah.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It's more than just a cookbook! This book I've been waiting for Tim to write more than the others. This is the one where he goes in depth on how he goes about learning something new. What steps does he take to break something down, what profile does he look for in mentors, what does he focus on to get ahead, etc.? This is the book where you learn how to learn, because we talk a lot about learning skills, but too many of us don't realize that learning is itself a skill.<br /><br />Learning aside, I've already made more than one dish in the book and plan on making more. It's really easy to get started and you'll make a lot of progress really early on.<br /><br />Buy it for kindle like I did, but I recommend having a physical copy of it as well.<br /><br />Excellent book.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|I'm updating my original review because it is now working over our wifi.  Once you figure out how to update your configuration for your wifi from WEP to WPA, it connects and works pretty well.<br /><br />They really need to provide better instructions for changing your wifi settings.  There is nothing in the manual or online about this that I could find.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The quality of writing and the steady pace of the book make Vince Flynn a joy to read.<br />Mike Rapp is at the top of his game as usual
B00785P2QC|5.0|I think it is great and you should make it more Niger and better<br />Unfortunately I don't like it to tree it
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not believe all the surprised through the book. I never saw any of it coming and couldn't stop reading.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|For a game to play while wasting time, it's perfect. Trying to get my other brony friends to play. Give it a shot.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This is not what I expected. Not that its a bad game. It still fills the time. Hope others enjoy it
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I thought this was too simple but as I move forward it is becoming challenging.  Fun too! I recommend it for anyone.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This story contains all the usual quirky characters, and a plot line filled with guessing, twists and turns and a few surprises. As always, the dead speak to Dr. Scarpetta- and they have much that is interesting to say. Love the creative detail, the scenes that the reader can almost feel- and the action that rarely slows down for a breath.<br /><br />Keep them coming, Ms Cornwell.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I stared watching this show on Netflix and now I cant get enough of it. I cut the cable years ago and with all the money i save.I can put my money behind the show that I like.  I would watch the past two season on Netflix.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|This move was not as good as they said it was on the ads. The move was nothing like 300 and how they clamied it to be. I would pass on this movie. It put me to sleep and was not as action packed like 300 was, i would pass on the movie
B009VB97EY|1.0|the story suck, I got roped in to watch this movie by a girlfriend. It was more for her than anything else. we did not even watch the half of the movie.
B005LAIGPA|2.0|I see why the movie wasnt out in the theaters long. it was boring and also there was no explination on the powers and what caused them this. it put me to sleep, very boring
B003SI9WYG|4.0|this is a classic for the holidays. One of my child hood all time favorites. I think this got me in to zombie movie
B002ZG99QS|2.0|Decent movie good details  during the game starts but ends way to fast. not alot of action. Which for this movie i would have like to see more action. It is a decent remake but they could have done better. i wanted more and expected more
B0098VYCCE|3.0|I watched this and thought it was very good.  It lacked something, but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  It maybe some humorous comments that were made, but really didn't come off on cue.  I am not a good critic so I liked the movie, watched it twice but wouldn't buy it unless there was a part 2 that really wowed me.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A thrilling second installment to the HG trilogy. The only downside to this book  is knowing that the complete story is almost at its end.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|A really solid game filled with lots of levels and great artwork. Not quite tiny wings status, but this game is beautiful. Creative idea and compelling story really drive the game forward.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I have been reading John Grisham novels since \\"The Firm\\" and \\"A Time to Kill\\" and except for a couple of hiccups they have all been both entertaining and fascinating. In \\"The Litigators\\"  the different twist is that the protagonist both loses and wins. That's all I will say without spoiling it. I highly recommend The Litigators be read by all Grisham fans and others.
0756666937|4.0|Was not exactly what I expected, but it is a cute book. I thought it was going to have design patterns for lego creations, but it is a history/learning book with lots of information about how legos are made, the logo, the patten, etc. Not a bad book for a collector, but not what I was expecting when I bought it for my 8 year old son.
B005V20JKI|5.0|This is a crazy game. I didn't know what to expect when I played this. Your goal in this game is to collect as many muffins as you can. They are used to upgrade your character and buy new ones.<br /><br />The gameplay: It's setup like the old Mario Brothers game. Enemies start at the top of the board and work their way down. Each time you collect a muffin, your character changes into another creature. Each creature has their own abilities. These include attacks and special moves. There are about 20 creatures you can unlock ranging from different animals to powerful knights. You select what board you want to play on and then try and gather as many muffins as possible. Enemies spawn at the top of the board and you can attack them or dodge them. The enemies differ on each board and range from 1 hit kills to 2 hit kills. They can also get enraged if you jump on them. The last board is the only board with a different goal other than collecting muffins. You have to allow the fire rocks to fall off the board at the bottom, hitting the creature in the background that is actually sending them in your board.<br /><br />The story: You are a little boy sent out to return the old fairy's magical muffins. The curse put on the little boy is what makes him transform every time he touches a muffin. Upon return of all the fairy's muffins, she may lift the curse.....<br /><br />I found this app to be quite fun and addicting. Each creature has 3 upgrades available and it was fun opening up new creatures to see what they can do.<br /><br />Installed and runs just fine on my Samsung Galaxy S phone.
B0015GF4FO|5.0|Not entirely germane to true psychodynamic practice, but fun, engaging, and sometimes thought provoking nonetheless.  In the end, though, it's meant to just be engaging entertainment - which it is.
B00000E7Q6|4.0|I've been listening to this cd a lot lately.  It's really an album with its own feel and you'd probably be better off not trying to compare it with other works by the man.<br /><br />It was actually rediscovering Duran Duran's Notorious album, with production from Nile Rodgers, that lead me to coming back to Black Tie, White Noise.  It's a much different album from the Duran Duran, but there's a loose sort of funk and dark, but chill mood that both albums have.  I guess I connect that with Rodger's production to a degree.  This one is an entirely different project to \\"Let's Dance,\\" which was also great.<br /><br />I love the covers of The Walker Brothers and Morrissey on here.  Bowie really does a nice job with those tracks, relating to the style of the original creators (who took also from him), making them his own in return.<br /><br />This is essentially a stop all on its own in the Bowie discography.  It comprises no trilogy, no scene, embodies no ongoing persona.  The Buddha of Suburbia album was also made around this time and is also great.  The two records comprise an interesting and oft overlooked mini-era in Bowie's career where he seemed confident and loose in his craft.  The late '80s identity confusion had parted and the '90s industrial-techno baiting directions were yet to come.  It's period where the man simply seemed comfortable in making some quality music that he wanted to make at the time.  It works very well.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|games purely a great time killer.. so far it has been very awesome.. but i have a problem and maybe a suggestion about those visitors.. maybe its a good idea to put a shop to maybe let the visitors buy and feed the dragons so that they may be putted to good use other than that so awesome .. one more thing i hate it that i cant add friends coz i have to add them to FB first T-T
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Ordered the 3D version of Avatar. Played it tonight and loved it. The DVD played all the way through without any glitches. The 3D portions were amazing to watch and of course enjoyed the story line. Loved it in the theater and loved it at home. Thanks...Cathy
B008XG1X18|1.0|Not interested in competing for the use of my own name as a screen name.<br />If I'm logging in with my email address, what exact difference does it make.<br /><br />Not having it.
B008Z9L94O|1.0|A poorly remastered attempt at replicating the splendor of the original. Definitely a rush job to meet the Christmas market. We buy vinyl to get the best sound possible; when each track sounds worse than the 16-year-old CD version, you know something is wrong.<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting this for a Pumpkins fan for Christmas, don't. Seriously. They'll thank you in the long run.<br /><br />Boycott this release and maybe Billy Corgan will get his act together and give his fans something that's worth the money.
B00355L2TU|5.0|Digital download:  I bought 2 of the 3 workouts for use with my Kindle Fire.  I love that I could purchase individual workouts as opposed to all the workouts on the program.  Love that I can take it anywhere with decent wi-fi.  Slower connections cause skipping in the video, but at my house, it works fine.<br /><br />As for the workout, I've been doing it for over a year; and I found it to be effective.  Highly recommend 30 minutes workouts in your home over driving anywhere for an expensive fitness class.  Just sayin.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Another good effort by the Disney people. The movie has a decent plot and good story line that imparts some basic values without being preachy. Kids an adults will enjoy watching this together
B0063IH60K|3.0|Yeah, it's solitaire; and seems to work just like solitaire should.  If you want to play solitaire, this app provides that.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|I discovered the original Asia rather late in the game, having been exposed first to GTR and Yes, who were contemporaneous with my high school years.  However, the band was an instant favorite, and I bought almost everything the members did as individuals or with groups (even \\"Wetton-Manzanera\\" and \\"3\\")  until John Wetton left the Asia days behind in 1992, seemingly for good.<br /><br />I never really enjoyed the \\"Asia in Asia\\" concert with Greg Lake, and I must also confess being disappointed by the Payne era.  For me, John Wetton was always the voice of Asia.  I was excited when \\"Phoenix\\" came out, and \\"Omega\\" surpassed my hopes for a follow-up album.  This long-awaited live concert features the best of the \\"Omega\\" album, plus highlights from Asia's career.<br /><br />John Wetton's voice has stood the test of decades, and his bass guitar anchors the music well.  Geoff Downes, always one of my favorite rock keyboardists, supplies dramatic flair to each song.  Steve Howe's unique style adds weight to Asia's progressive pop sound, and his two acoustic pieces are delightful.  Carl Palmer deserves special praise for his propulsive drumming and stage presence.<br /><br />As a side note, I have used the anti-war song \\"Holy War\\" to demonstrate to my Western Civilization classes how the Crusades are still with us in spirit.  I can only anticipate that the live concert album for \\"XXX\\" will be just as great, and that Asia will be performing for several more years -- no longer just a super-group of the '80s, but now a \\"super\\" group in their own right.<br /><br />P.S.  This includes the full-length 2-CD live album as well as the full concert DVD -- easily worth the value!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app:)!!!! It has all the different versions of the Bible and it has a verse of the day!!!! If you love to read the Bible or do a daily devotion this is the app for you;)!!!! I encourage getting this app
B001AXU1BY|5.0|Great picture! The widescreen opened up the movie, there is so much missing from the movie when watched in pan and scan on the vhs version or on TV. Awesome transfer. It's like watching it for the first time again!
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|have not watched yet waiting  for gyp rossetti to get whacked. i'm sure its great' we have enjoyed the previous shows
B0044RUSZM|4.0|When I bought this stand, I thought I'd be getting a cheap piece of plastic. I half-expected to send it back to Amazon. Once I got it, I was pleasantly surprised. It's a nice, brushed metal finish similar to that of any Macbook Pro. The bottom Base is a hard almost resin-like plastic. The stand is able to support my Samsung laptop nicely. I'm not sure I'd trust it with anything larger than 15 inches though...<br /><br />The only stand I've had experience with that I can compare this to is the mStand. While I really like the mStand's design, it is geared more for Apple users. I liked the Griffin design because it seems to be able to accomodate both Apple and non-Apple computers quite well. The one thing I prefer the mStand for is the hole in the bottom for cable management.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give the product 4.5 stars if I could - only because the plastic clips on the top rack aren't as nicely designed as the rest of the unit and there aren't really any cable management options.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|my wife and i caught this movie at an artsy farsty theater in san antonio. the movie was packed and every one was laughing and hooting great show so we bought it
B008XG1X18|5.0|It took some time, but the \\"virtual bulletin board\\" site Pinterest is finally available as an Android based app and as such - it totally ROCKS! The app runs seamlessly and makes it so very simple to \\"pin on the fly\\" by selecting your share function at any time you are viewing something you wish to pin. The screens scroll easily, load fast and are exactly a miniature version of the full site... easily a full winner in my book!

B00A6I87UQ|1.0|Cant get to load on my iPad. However I really bought it to use on the non back lit kindle standard but it is not listed as an option. Since most of us want to preserve our dark eye adaptation it would make sense for Sky and Telescope to make this available for users of the non back lit devices.<br /><br />I have since returned the kindle atlas and am looking forward to my refund unfortunately.<br /><br />If they release this for the normal Kindle then I will probably purchase again. But until then.....
B009S8PEHY|4.0|This is the first Rod Stewart Album I have bought. But I do have a few selected tracks from the way-back machine prior to my relationship with Amazon's mp3 offerings. I'm good with Rod Stewart, but I'm not someone who checks out everything he does. ***However*** this album comprises a selection of tracks I know I can enjoy and put to use on my various holiday playlists. Check it out track-by-track. I'm guessing you'll end up buying the album.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I thought this was a very good book! I would highly recommend it. Will be looking for more by Kathleen Grissom.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I splurged for the 4-book set, thinking I'd like it and it would be a good deal if so (it's hard to keep up with all the reading I do, and books get really expensive!)<br /><br />Luckily, I read and read and read, and couldn't put my Kindle down. These books are great. I can't wait for Carriger's next parasol protectorate novel! /drool
B0055SWM08|5.0|Never been game fan, in my years with the Axim and later with smartphones I've focused exclusively on productivity apps, I have a handicap that all but limits my available game choices to chess and others that do not require more than one hand to play. I tried Quell and was immediately hooked,  like checkers or chess, it requires mind rather than dexterity to progress through it's many levels. After this post I'll go right to buying the paid version; it may or may not have additional levels or features, doesn't matter to me, I just want to reward the author for his effort in making this very entertaining piece of work.
B005NFW0U0|5.0|my daughter an i watch this together... we love this show very much.... and buy the dvd when they come out, would recommend it to anyone....
B000FBJAOG|5.0|A very knowledgeable book for potential zombie outbreak. I personally enjoyed this book. I recommend this book for any die hard zombie fans like me.

B004VMUS9G|4.0|it works great on my kindle fire.....I never miss an alarm^_^ this might be the beet one yet<br />(extra words so I can submit review)
B007ZGO7EM|1.0|I haven't had a chance to look at this in deapth yet. Mainly because the app REQUIRES you to be &quot;signed in&quot; in order to even use it. Not sure if its just for the first time use or for every use, but being denied the ability to use it cuz I'm not signed in to my amazon account is just an inconvienance
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Adventure games have a vast range of complexity. Many I've played have been too hard to even get started let alone complete. For those of us who have limited time to play games but still enjoy an adventure game now and then, there is a market for ones that are challenging but not impossible.<br /><br />The Lost City seemed, at first, to be such a game. There's a good backstory and the initial scenes and actions provide a solid start. (I played my version on a Kindle Fire; the graphics were good and transitions speedy.) Gameplay is not too hard, indeed some might argue it may be too easy, but it quickly gets to the point where you have to think a bit before making your next step. Once you have an item, it's pretty straight-forward on how to use it. And there is some logic to the flow of the game, without too much backtracking and revisiting scenes you've already completed. In other words, it was challenging but playable.<br /><br />My problems started about midway in. The number of scenes seemed to explode in number. (There are upwards of 50 scenes. I would think a maximum, especially for a game of this level of required experience, should be 12 to 15.) It became far too difficult to remember exactly what was where, even if you knew (or guessed) what to do next. Complicating this is the fact that some actions can only be accomplished in a particular season. I suppose all this would be acceptable to a degree, but what made it so discouraging to me was that the storyline seemed to lose all logic at this point. I admit I consulted the hints quite a bit here, and even though I knew what to do (from the hint) I couldn't understand why I was doing it.<br /><br />It's entirely possible I simply tired of the game long before it ended. One change in gameplay I would have appreciated, and probably would have gone a long ways towards making the game more enjoyable in the latter chapters, is if I could move to a scene by simply tapping on it from the map. Since you can't do that, you have to manually backtrack, sometimes very long ways and often making a mistake in direction causing you to have to consult the map again, to go from one scene to another.<br /><br />So, what rating to give? Clearly a 4 for the first half, when my actions made sense and I could figure out what to do based on objects acquired and available scenes. More like a 1 or 2 for the last half, when all logic vanished and it simply became an exercise in following the hints in order to finish. Call it 3 for good measure, but that may be a little generous., you have to manually backtrack, sometimes very long ways and often making a mistake in direction causing you to have to consult the map again, to go from one scene to another.<br /><br />So, what rating to give?

1416550550|4.0|Reminded me of the Secret Garden.  A needed rest from non-fiction.  A book worth reading. I would definately read this author again.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|If you like war pictures and a little bunch of dum aliens this is the picture for you. Alot of action and GUESS who wins. Good special effects, acting not to bad either. Worth the price and don't forget the making of part.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Good protective case, easy to get out. Wish I bought this three years ago when my son was a baby!
0316069434|5.0|Connelly's Harry Bosch never fails to deliver. Connelly's writing is refreshing, fast paced, intriguing, believable and most of all, entertaining. All writers build a flaw into their protagonist and Harry's is his disdain for authoritative figures in the LAPD...at least those he has to report to. Connelly never makes the character flaw the story nor does he let the flaw interfere with the storyline unlike some other authors (see DeMille's John Corey in The Panther)...but I digress. Mystery lovers will once again be enamored with the cold case exploits of Harry Bosch; this time reaching back to the LA riots of '92. This is another \\"can't put it down\\" book by Connelly. Pure enjoyment. The only disappointment is when the story ends and you realize that you won't see another Harry Bosch novel for close to a year!
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|There is no way to change the location for the weather displayed for a Kindle. What good does the weather report in Las Angeles do me when I am in Arizona?

B0086700CM|1.0|extreme lag issues, choppy and bitted up, ugh.....<br />they don't even look the gmame over or test it out on kindle, they do 1 small update then they're done
B005K0HDGE|5.0|If you ever wanted to time-travel, and wonder how you could change history, this is the book for you.  Well written, compelling and historical to boot.

B003LSTK8G|4.0|This was really an amazing book to read.  So much has been written and said about the financial crisis, how it was individual borrowers at fault, it was Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, when the reality was that it was really a cabal of rich white guys who led Wall St to ruin, then lightly fell to Earth with their golden parachute breaking their fall.....

B0092MKTL2|5.0|I heard this band on the radio, and knew that I needed to hear more of their work. After finding them, I got the entire album and haven't regretted a single second of that. AMAZING music.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Amazing hair animation, good story. Yes another Disney ethic girl story. Here are the 9 more words I must write.
B009GLHF5C|5.0|Adding a great new flavor to their already passionate lyrics, Muse remains one of my top bands due to their truth to their lyrical sound. I love the album, especially the song Follow Me. If you're not comfortable with them changing their style slightly, though, you may want to pass on this album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I would recommend this book to any of my friends who read Harry potter or twilight. It has that same feeling of bringing you in and never wants you to let go. I'm addicted!
B008O80RA8|5.0|Since a long time I've been a fan of Gilbert and have considered he is very versatile and prodigious guitar player, but Vibrato album shows definitely that he is one of the best. To hear so many different styles on an album without disengaging; pieces like: Enemies (In jail), Bivalve Blues, Roundabout, The Pronghorn, Go Down, Atmosphere On The Moon...leave no doubt that he can play almost any piece or style that he pleases to please his fans. The track that should be rewarded for their brilliant execution, taking into account its complexity, is probably Blue Rondo A La Turk, now a great tribute to Brubeck (RIP)..In brief Vibrato is the album that was missing from Gilbert...Enjoy it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the few times that I can say I am glad I saw the movie first. Already knowing how this intense book would end, I was able to relax and just enjoy all of the details that the book includes which didn't make it into the movie. I loved the characters and the well thought out plot. Looking forward to the rest of the series.
B000M4RGA6|5.0|I was worried about ordering a used movie but this was in very good condition, almost like new. I could tell that it had barely been used so it was a great bargain.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Best movie series of this decade! The packaging is really nice and all the bonuses are awesome. I look foward to watching them again and agian.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I love this movie so I was very happy to find it for such a great price. I don't really care for the collector's edition and extra content versions, I only really wanted the movie and that is exactly what I got. The blu-ray still has some behind the scenes content so if you want that as well as the movie all in one disc, this is the copy for you.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|In debating whether to give this album four stars or five, I listened to it for a third time and realized that it stands out as being a complete pop album. Even the extra tracks on the deluxe edition have no weak moments. I mean, how many pop albums out there offer 16 tracks with NO FILLER? To be honest, I didn't think Ke$ha had an album like this in her, especially as a sophomore effort, on which even the best and most popular artists tend to struggle.<br /><br />Ke$ha gets everything right here; she writes great hooks and still keeps her party-heavy persona, she is not afraid to rap often (and quite well), and she has apparently learned to play several instruments as well. While \\"Animal\\" and \\"Cannibal\\" had several songs with great hooks, there were a number of filler tracks or just annoying tracks on those two albums, making her sound juvenile and even uninterested at times. But she is fully engaged here. So many potential singles, the smash \\"Die Young\\" is obvious, and a few others (\\"C'Mon\\" and \\"Crazy Kids\\") may make the grade as well. But the real standout is towards the end of the album, \\"Gold Trans Am,\\" in which she succeeds in bridging the gap between electro-heavy pop and classic rock and roll. Many artists attempted to expand on the electro pop sound (Aguilera, Gaga, etc) while others just keep churning out the same stuff (like Katy Perry, Rihanna). But Ke$ha is evolving rapidly and taking huge steps toward not only credibility, but excellence as both a songwriter and a pop star. Who would have thought, after hearing \\"Animal,\\" that she was capable of this on her sophomore album? Certainly not this reviewer. 4.5 stars.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I have always loved this movie and the product arrived exactly as described. I was a bit worried about ordering it but I am very happy with it.
0743289692|5.0|I found this book very interesting, with a story of a woman who suffers traditional practices. This particular lady is very smart, and ambitious, and makes it to the big leagues. This is not a book about religion, but of women's rights. Interesting read, but you need to read it with some balance.
B004N66XYE|5.0|Great look at British aristocracy in the 30's. Well done.Good to see the continuation of the real star - #165.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|It is a collection, missing a lot of Harry Bosch intrigue.  Short stories are always a disappointment to me. I am use to a plot that is carefully unwoven and a read which slowly pulls you into the story..
B0070Y46UY|5.0|WOW probably one of the best books I've read in a decade. The ending after such a poetic meaty story is shocking and devoid of any poetic sympathies.
0316069434|5.0|Have every book he has written and could not wait for this to arrive. just started reading it yesterday, but am sure will really enjoy
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Yes I know this may not be the greatest movie of all time. It may not even be one of Mel Brook's greatest movies. But I still have a huge place in my heart for this! I have watched it maybe 100 times and I still love it. I'm so excited to have the most complete version available! I've had some of these special on different versions, but it's great to have them all on one disc!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It could have been such a good movie, but the director went the horror route. It had such potential but failed.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|I would probably rate it highly as we have the first four seasons.  What is not highly rated is the number of years it takes to get this series.  Movie co issues?
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn's The Last Man is a great read as always from this author! There's lots of action and lots of political incorrectness!
0345529057|5.0|This product is estimated to be delivered within the 3-5 day limit for regular shipment, and the series is awesome. At this price you save about $25 on the first four books, as compared to buying even the cheapest print of each book separate. If you like medieval fiction, and like politics this series is for you. The HBO series is really good, follows the books closely, but like with most tv adaptations, the tv just doesn't compare to the books.<br /><br />So, for the price point, and the great story, buy this box set.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This movie really doesn't focus on Lincoln's life or presidency, or even the Civil War.  It focused on ratifying the 13th Amendment to end slavery and all of the political manuevering and infighting that went with it.<br /><br />I thought the film was very well done.  It was historically accurate, and the acting was superb.  Daniel Day-Lewis was brilliant as Lincoln.  I've always heard that Lincoln had a high pitch voice, and Lewis had it down pat.  And his mannerisms were just as I have always pictured Lincoln.  Also, Lincoln was known for his down-home country humor, and Lewis did that very well.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones and Sally Fields were also excellent.  Jones played Thaddeus Stevens, a powerful member of the House of Representatives.  I looked Stevens up on Wikepedia, and he looked like a pretty rough character, although he always fought for social justice.  Tommy Lee was perfect for the part.  He stold the show in my opinion.<br /><br />Basically, the movie was about abolishing the worst social injustice in this country's history and how it all came about.  I'm giving it my highest rating.

0140328696|3.0|It's the same classic story, but I was lazy and just popped it into my shopping cart; didn't even think to look at it and notice that it does not include the original illustrations. Part of the joy of a Roald Dahl book is, for me, the Quentin Blake illustrations. Nobody's fault but mine, but pay attention when you order to ensure this generic version is the one you actually want. (As for the story itself, well, it's Willy Wonka! One of the best ever. Bought it for my child but I plan to keep it forever....well, the other version with the QB illustrations.)

B0067EKY7M|2.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br /> The interesting thing about 'Salmon Fishing in Yemen' is that the title represents the film's sub-plot and not the main plot. A wealthy Yemeni Sheikh, Muhammed, seeks to introduce salmon fishing to Yemen. His handler in Great Britain, Harriet Chetwode-Talbot (Emily Blunt), can't convince Alfred \\"Fred\\" Jones (Ewan McGregor), a government fisheries expert, to support the project since he believes that Yemen doesn't have the necessary cold temperatures and water to sustain salmon. But when the Prime Minister's cynical press secretary, Patricia Maxwell (Kristen Scott Thomas), needs a feel-good story to counter all the bad news coming out of Afghanistan, suddenly Fred is forced to make nice to Harriet and actually attempt to make the project work.<br /><br />'Fishing in Yemen' works well when it concentrates on all the machinations involving the push to make the Sheikh's project succeed. Various obstacles crop up, including the fishing industry's objection to depleting UK's stock of fresh water salmon. In Fred's estimation, farm raised salmon still can be utilized, and he predicts that those kind of salmon will also swim upstream. There are also local obstacles to the Sheikh's project in Yemen itself. In a rather unlikely scene, Fred's thwarts the assassination of the Sheikh by a bumbling militant, through the intervention of his fishing reel.<br /><br />But the bulk of 'Fishing' has to do with a love triangle between Fred, Harriet and Harriet's new boyfriend, Robert, who is suddenly missing in action during a secret military mission in Afghanistan. Rather predictably, Fred is on the outs with his workaholic wife, Mary, which opens up the possibility that he can start things up with Harriet. Before you know it, Robert is no longer missing, and Harriet must choose between the two men at film's end.<br /><br />Instead of directly murdering the Sheikh and his friendly UK supporters, the local militants end up destroying his project by letting a dam open, flooding the whole area. Fair enough. But what about the resolution of the love triangle? Well, it's utterly predictable and sentimental--at the last moment, guess who Harriet chooses? And after the whole project is wiped out, the two lovebirds decide to remain in order to reignite the ruined experiment, ignoring the fact that they might be eventually murdered by the same militants who attempted to wipe the Sheikh out earlier as well as destroying his dream.<br /><br />Time Out's David Fear couldn't have said it better when he describes the Sheikh as an \\"Arabic version of the Magical Negro'. The Sheikh reminds one more of an expert motivational speaker at a New Age Enlightenment convention, than a real Middle Eastern potentate from that part of the world. Amr Waked is fine in that role as are the other principals, Blunt, McGregor and Thomas.<br /><br />I'm told that the original book the film was based on was much more satirical than the rom-com we find here. Salmon Fishing is mildly entertaining, but eventually devolves into some real gooey, sentimental stuff. One viewing really is enough.is project by letting a dam open, flooding the whole area.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is one of the best books (Kindle) I've read in a long time. So many twists and turns. I couldn't put the book down!
0812984412|5.0|but it earned the fifth.<br /><br />I had no idea that this book even existed until I saw the trailer for the movie. I had read about the movie and the book's unique structure, and knew I had to read it.<br /><br />I was afraid that the connections between the six stories would either be really obscure and hard to find, or that they would be glaringly obvious. I was glad to discover that there are all sorts of connections. Some are glaringly obvious, some are very subtle, and some read like throwaway lines until the whole book is read.<br /><br />Someone else mentioned that they started rereading the book the minute they finished it. I will do the same. I have already read the book one-and-a-half times; I had to reread the first part to fully appreciate the second part of each story when they worked backward through the book.<br /><br />One thing that surprised me is the different genres of each of the six stories. Each is written in a different style that works for that particular story.<br /><br />Another thing that surprised me is how moving some of the stories were.<br /><br />To sum up, this book works on many different levels and is a definite must-read. Of course, now I have to see the movie!<br /><br />Although it says I read the paperback, I actually read this on the Amazon Kindle Fire. It really helped being able to instantly look up obscure words, to search for phrases in the book (to see where I had read that name before in another story), and to look up, say, a map of the Chatham Islands so I had a better understanding of that particular story.
0783229526|1.0|it's hard enough to try to explain being high to someone, let alone trying to film some visuals which is what I loathed about this film.  There is a wonderful back story - it's really not all abour the drugs - but ya wouldn't know it by watching this movie.  I love HST - grew up on him - he held more influence than did either parent.  Go buy the book.  PS  Where the Buffalo Roam is actually a much better film and is based on Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail.  And it is also a better book.  Can't wait to see the Rum Diary - Hopefully it will be a great movie - there's much more to work with.

B007REV4T8|4.0|Daniel Craig made an impressive debut as Ian Fleming's super spy James Bond in Casino Royale, but its followup, Quantum of Solace, was a marked drop off which threatened to derail the franchise.  Enter director Sam Mendes (American Beauty), a well honed script (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan), and a dream cast.  The result is a well acted, emotionally compelling adventure thriller that takes the formula and rips it open to expose Agent 007 as we've never seen before.  It is also one of the best films of the year and certainly one of the very best Bond films.<br /><br />British secret service agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) and fellow operative Eve (Naomie Harris) are in pursuit of a killer who has stolen a hard drive containing the names of all NATO agents imbedded in terrorist groups.  A fateful decision by MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) leads to Bond being put out of commission.  While M is being leveraged into retirement by her supervisor (Ralph Feinnes) and Bond has lost his edge, a mysterious figure (Javier Bardem) from M's past begins a reign of cyber terror and revenge.  As agent 007 struggles with his future and his loyalties to M, he must look to his past to reconcile his biggest challenge.<br /><br />There are obvious comparisons to The Dark Knight Rises with a fallen hero searching for his `mojo'.  Most Bond films operated superficially and featured unusual characters, and with rare exceptions (On Her Majesty's Secret Service and of course the more recent Casino Royale) did we delve into the personal side.  While early incarnations of the super agent showed him nearly invincible, this Bond is a more humanized reinvention without emasculating its hero.  For the first time, Craig's Bond has a sense of humor with puns and quips (a staple of the earlier films).  In fact, much of the dialogue is sharp.<br /><br />By delving into the core relationships, the filmmakers have added layers and twists to a conventional formula.  The main themes center on loyalty,sins of the past, and tradition clashing with the new order.  There are parallels between Bond and M as relics of an age gone by and between Bond and his doppelganger as direct opposites.<br /><br />This is Dench's showcase as M.  Although her allegiance to Bond was a recurring theme in the previous two films with Craig, never before has her character been shown in such depth.  After seven Bond films, her M has gone from background to foreground as a primary plot point, and she does not disappoint.<br /><br />There is a nice buildup to Bardem's entrance whose psychological motives are questionable including his sexuality.  This is not your father's Bond villain.  As Silva, a man with a dark past whose methods are bold and brazen, Bardem instills a decided creepiness and cunning that is refreshing. Think of Bardem's character as the black sheep of a dysfunctional family with M in the maternal role.<br /><br />A strong supporting cast includes Ben Whishaw as the new quartermaster Q, a young computer whiz who represents the new breed of spy, Bérénice Marlohe as a stunning beauty who holds the key to her dangerous employer, and Harris in a pivotal role.<br /><br />With splendid global locations (Istanbal, Shanghai, and Scotland), this may be the most beautifully shot Bond film (Roger Deakins) since You Only Live Twice.  Some scenes are visual standouts like a sultry shower rendezvous and a moment of hand-to-hand combat all done in shadows and silhouette.<br /><br />In this age of 24, Jason Bourne, and Homeland, the stakes are much higher in depicting realistic action and techie scenes, and Skyfall holds its own with solid set pieces including a subway bombing and a tense climax with echoes of Straw Dogs.  There are specific references to the Bond canon including the reappearance of a certain iconic car.<br /><br />It is remarkable how current, top directors have been directly influenced or inspired by these movies.  Steven Spielberg did the Indiana Jones movies as homage to Bond films and even cast former Bond, Sean Connery, as Indy's dad!  James Cameron did his take on a super spy with True Lies.  Christopher Nolan filmed an entire sequence in Inception as tribute to Bond.  David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has Bond style, opening credits; (Skyfall has terrific credits and a sultry, throwback theme song by Adele).  Even Quentin Tarantino suggested several years ago that the Bond films needed to get gritty and basic; think the filmmakers took notice?<br /><br />As J.J. Abrams' Star Trek and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins showed, a classic franchise can be reinvented or updated while reaping enormous dividends.  With the most touching finale to a Bond film, there are big surprises and a distinct familiarity by film's end that sets the series for a grand run.  For Bond purists, this is uncharted territory, but by `shaking' up the mythology, Bond's story has become `stirring'.

B005S9ELM6|4.0|Ben Affleck has been a leading man with credibility behind the camera as the Oscar-winning co-writer (with Matt Damon) of Good Will Hunting.  Having shown promise as a director in Gone Baby Gone and then excelling in The Town, he has peaked in his craft with Argo, a thoroughly engaging, real life thriller grounded in historic fact and abetted by a superior screenplay (Chris Terrio from a news article).<br /><br />On November 4, 1979 in revolutionary Iran, angry students storm the US embassy and take civilian and military hostages, but unknown to the public, six Americans escape to a nearby Canadian's home where they remain stranded with no hope of rescue.  Despite a myriad of standard tactics to spirit them out of Iran, every plan has a serious flaw, and each passing day heightens the probability of the Americans' discovery, capture, and possible execution as spies.  Enter Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), an expert at ex-filtration or the liberating of valuable government assets for the CIA.  His plan is a bold, imaginative conceit: a Hollywood movie crew scouting locations in Iran while sneaking the Americans out as part of the film crew.  Despite the misgivings of highly skeptical State Department and CIA officials led by Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the mission is given a `go' with little hope of success.  Compounding things is the fact that the Iranians are painstakingly sifting through the embassy's hastily shredded documents.  With the assistance of an Oscar winning makeup artist, John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Mendez creates an elaborate, fake science fiction movie named Argo complete with a script and cast.  Will this movie cover work and can Mendez get the six Americans to freedom in time?  As a true story only recently declassified by the US government, these actual events lead to a breathtaking finish.<br /><br />The authentic reenactment of the embassy takeover is expertly, vividly intercut seamlessly with real newsfootage.  Affleck has a keen eye for detail, and he convincingly captures the chaos and paranoia that grips the trapped Americans.  Good use of handheld camerawork adds to the authentic feel of this quasi-documentary narrative.  It's like an episode of TV's Mission Impossible, and, in fact, this could easily have been a made-for-TV movie, but it works better on the big screen where it has maximum impact.  There are more than passing similarities to Wag the Dog and its phony movie ruse.<br /><br />The Anti-American sentiment and mistrust fosters a claustrophobic atmosphere as the six Americans are under great pressure. The film depicts the real threats and atrocities in the city streets including random executions.  Not knowing who to trust, the Americans bicker amongst themselves with some expressing serious reservations about this unusual rescue premise while others are feeling despondent.  Their fear is not unlike those of pursued Holocaust civilians in World War II.<br /><br />Mendez, who risks his life to save these strangers, is also a father, and it is that relationship that frames his character in the film emotionally.  Chambers and Siegel (a composite character) are patriots with big egos, and while their comic relief is welcome (including a running gag: an off-color play on the word Argo,) in an otherwise suspense-filled narrative, one wonders what truly motivates them?<br /><br />The final airport sequence is unbearably tense as it ratchets up the threat, and such a relatively basic situation is executed to great effect.  We know how the story will end yet it affects us in a visceral way.  If the filmmakers take some dramatic license at the end, the film has earned the right to embellish the facts a bit further.  After seeing their story, to see the images of the actors and their real life counterparts in the closing credits adds poignancy and credibility.<br /><br />One can only hope that Affleck can excel to loftier heights with his next project.  He isalready in rarified air, and an Oscar nomination awaits.  In Argo, he has fashioned a nail-biter that never ignores the humanity that binds us together, whether it be father and son, husband and wife, or a rescuer and his newly found friends.
B009FZFONO|5.0|To be honest- when all my friends kept saying you HAVE to watch the walking dead.... I was like...Really?? How good can yet ANOTHER zombie show/movie be...never mind a long running series... OK... I was WRONG.... this show is great.... mainly because it isn't really about zombies.... that is just the background to set the stage for how all of the &#34;living&#34; interact and react to this apocalypse. Season 3 really starts to develop with two plot lines that eventually intersect...well more like CLASH. The turn over in cast (due to a high death rate) was originally annoying because key characters you liked would die, but new &#34;survivors&#34; were constantly introduced. Now you see that all the former cast &#34;deaths&#34; have really helped to shape the remaining core characters. I don't want to spoil any plot points here.<br /><br />Definitely suspenseful, intriguing, and makes you look forward to the next episode. Also definitely NOT just another zombie story.

B007FEFLTO|4.0|I read book one which is largely set in Wales and thoroughly enjoyed it. Book two is equally absorbing, and takes us back to Wales and, through the war years, to Germany, Spain, France, Russia and London. It traces the same families and their fates as war descends on Europe for the second time. I struggled at the beginning to remember who was who from the earlier book as it was ages ago when I read it. In the end I didn't worry too much and just got on with the enjoyment of it. I figured it all out in the end. Follett is a no-holds-barred writer, not for the squeamish or easily shocked. His descriptions of the good and also horrific things which happened in the lives of his characters are quite graphic and leave little to the imagination. The stark horrors of war, imprisonment, torture and  murder, the terrible injustices and eventual come-uppance for the miscreants is all laid out for us to see. It's not a perfect 5 for me, perhaps a bit predictable, but a solid 4 and I am looking forward to the finale in due course.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Sometimes a book will leave you thinking, daydreaming even, long after you finish the last page. Not this book sadly. When I deided to write this brief review I had to check the synopsis to recall what the book was about. And moreover I only read it a month ago. So that kind of says it all for me. It is immediate gratification, of course enjoyable like most of Grisham's work, but nothing which is going to add value to my life. Some of his books do make a difference to me, and I am thinking in particular of The Litigators, which I have read more than once and still thoroughly enjoy. Even after reading it the first time, months after, I could recall the characters and wonderfully funny plots and counter plots. It was so real and I truly identified with the three lawyers and their secretary, the situations they found themselves in. I cared about them. They became like family. Not so withThe Racketeer. I couldn't really care much what happened to the &#34;hero&#34; to be honest. I read it in a couple of days so It must have been quite compelling but, a bit like an ice cream, once you have finished it you don't really think about it again. Hey it's OK. But definitely 4 star not 5. If you are a Grisham fan, it's worth buying or borrowing to complete the set, but don't expect his best.

B005LAII3U|5.0|I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the Director's Cut and its theatrical counterparts, so here are the differences between the two (NOTE: SPOILERS FOLLOW).<br /><br />The Director's Cut runs about 12 minutes longer than the theatrical cut.  No additional gore has been added although additional F-bombs have been added.  Ethan Hawke makes a surprise appearance in a scene that was cut from the theatrical movie.<br /><br />(1) Extra scene of Quaid meeting with a Human Resources Management representative from the Cohaagen administration who requests that he sign a non-disclosure agreement given that he works at a sensitive defense production factory.  (I can see why this was cut as it didn't add much to the overall storyline.)<br /><br />(2) Extra scene of scantily clad women in Rekall neighborhood.  (The three mammary gland-ed lady still makes the same appearance with topless nudity.)<br /><br />(3) In the scene where Quaid finds the hidden holographic piano recording in his apartment, it has been altered to show Ethan Hawke as the old Quaid, revealing that Cohaagen also gave Quaid facial reconstructive surgery. (This was an interesting twist which I wished they had left in.  It explains why no one was able to recognize him.)<br /><br />(4) When Quaid and Melina escape from Lori in the elevator action sequence, there is a re-inserted shot of the destroyed elevator plunging onto the roadway below and destroying a hover car.  (Pretty neat CGI!)<br /><br />(5) During the UFB assault on Matthias's base, there is an extra shot of a white combat synth gunning down some hapless Resistance members.<br /><br />(6) Melina is revealed to be Matthias's daughter.  Cohaagen also refers to Melina as Matthias's daughter, rather than lieutenant.<br /><br />(7) Cohaagen talks a little more about his plan to use Quaid to lead to Matthias, revealing that it was Quaid's idea to have his memory wiped in order to feign allegiance to Matthias.<br /><br />(8) When Cohaagen has Quaid strapped to the chair, Quaid instead yells an F-word laced expletive at Cohaagen.<br /><br />(9) When Cohaagen ponders what to do with Melina, she spits in his face and screams the F-word, whereas in the theatrical cut she says \\"Never!\\"<br /><br />(10) The climactic final fight is slightly longer, showing an additional shot of UFB black-clad special forces troops getting gunned down by Melina and the fight between Cohaagen's black painted super-synth bodyguard and Quaid is slightly longer.<br /><br />And that's it.  The biggest addition is Ethan Hawke's reinserted scene.<br /><br />I enjoyed the Total Recall re-make, even if it lacked some of the campy humor and ridiculous gore of Paul Verhoeven's original.  I give it five stars for completely shallow reasons- Kate Beckinsale!  Hello.  Heck if I were Quaid and married to Kate Beckinsale I'd forget about Rekall.  Jessica Biel is easy on the eyes too.  The re-make is darker and more serious, akin to Minority Report meets Total Recall.  It seems to combine elements from both the Arnold film and Philip Dick's \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\".<br /><br />In a nod to the Verhoeven film, Harry and Quaid talk about going to Mars, a synthetic thug loses his arm, a similar looking \\"two weeks\\" woman walks by customs, Quaid uses holograms, Federal police engage in a zero-G gunbattle with Quaid, and the iconic three breasted woman makes an appearance.  Missing of course are the memorable Johnny Cab, Benny, the poor sap who gets perforated on the escalator, and Kuato.<br /><br />The action scenes are well staged even if TDI Vector sporting Federal police are mowed down like stormtroopers.  The technology is fascinating, especially \\"The Fall\\" and hand insertable phones.  The Colony's populace has a distinct Asian overtone and is more Blade Runner-esque.  The UFB is probably situated in England to make Beckinsale's native accent more convenient.<br /><br />I only wish they had made a hard R-version rather thanpander to the PG-13 desires of studio executives.

B00A6PD9I4|4.0|This is a beautiful film with a strong, interesting story that doesn't end in the fashion a Disney production. Which is a good thing. On the other hand the pacing is a little uneven and I'm not sure that kids will make all the connections - maybe they don't need to. The story has several threads which initially seem disconnected, however they all come together as the story progresses. The result is a satisfying experience for adults and a heroine that kids can relate to. I really wanted to give this film a full 5 stars and I'd say the only reason I didn't is because the film isn't especially memorable.

A superior, under appreciated follow up--Sleeps With Angels--followed up a year later--perhaps too soon, as every album by the Horse has a long, long shelf life. Its another winner.<br /><br />And then..... the wait. I wore have worn those four CDs out. Like Bob D said in Highlands, I just put Neil Young on and turn it up and hope the neighbors cut me some slack.<br /><br />The wait is over. Neil and the Horse have come through with a classic.<br /><br />I have a very difficult time getting beyond  track 3, Ramada Inn, when I play this magnificent album. Reason is, two of those first three songs are quite long, and all of them rank with Neil and Crazy Horse's very best.  Except that, more treasures await, if you can suppress the temptation to circle back.  The closer is a stunner.<br /><br />There are many others here who can give you the ins and outs of each song. I'm not even going to try. Beyond my paygrade.<br /><br />My message is, for the folks like me who have been waiting for the next installment of the opus commenced with Everybody Knows.... \\"You have mail\\"
034580404X|5.0|Good Read...  Couldn't put the first book down.  The second book was even better and I hated to see the third end.
0061906220|5.0|I have yet to look up the free song online, we've come up with our own rhythm and tune, that changes often.  The kids like to chime in to fill in the \\"goodness no\\" in their cute voices.  The theme is wonderful and practical and can be called upon during the day when something doesn't go their way as a reminder to keep walking along and singing your song.
B001CDWFPC|4.0|It is handy to have the ESV study bible on my Kindle FIRE so where ever I go I have all that content. However there are some areas where they give you a link for a a cross reference and it goes no where. You find a couple of those, but over all the links work, and the study notes are great and the maps are handy.<br />-<br />One really nice feature is called &#34;History of Salvation&#34; and in the bible text you might see the &#34; ^ &#34; symbol. Select that symbol and you will get the link to the &#34;History of Salvation&#34; for that bible verse. Very Handy!
B004SIP6ZE|2.0|This is a late review. I brought this movie sometime in the early year of 2012 and somewhere in Sept I opened the DVD, popped into my PS3, and it would not work. All my other DVDs worked with my PS3 except this one. Next, I tried it on my PC. The movie was playing but there was no audio and I was force to install something and whatever it was did not do anything. I contacted Amazon thinking, they probably aren't going to give my money back. Sad face. BUT! I got a full refund back and they said to keep the movie and do whatever I want with it. Now it's on my list of things I want to sell. Heh.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|The movie melds facts and the story line  so well that it makes you feel it could have actually happened
B000089RV6|5.0|Wonderful cd! Works great and was shipped quick! Very pleased and would purchase from again in the future. Thanks again
B0034G4P4O|4.0|I read some of the books when I was a kid and it was great to see them animated so well
B0035WTE2U|5.0|Great Cd, I love this cd has all their hits on one disc. I would recommend buying this if you love acdc
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 3 year old granddaughter and I loved watching it together.  She was so happy and excited when I gave her this DVD.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book<br />Grisham once again proved why he is the best. I didn't want the book to ever end.<br />A different style of writing for him, and I found it refreshing. Going to dream of 'gold bars' tonight.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Definitely a good story. A page turner.  It Keeps you guessing, and you do care about the narrator, who is an unlucky nice guy who was set up by the fed; but the storyline is a bit contorted in that the reader is not let in on everything that the narrator knows until it's convenient for him to complete the story so you may feel a bit confused since you thought you were missing something, and you were right.
B005LAII80|2.0|although the movie was OK, I was disappointed in the 3D effects. I kept flipping between looking through the 3D glasses and not using it and at times, can't tell the different here. The 3D effects were very disappointing to me. Nothing compared to Avatar. Save your money rent the regular version or buy the regular blu ray version. The movie itself was entertaining for me. But the 3D effects were non-existence. I gave a two stars due to the lack of 3D.  The best portion of the 3D were in the trailers to others 3D movies coming up. Those were eyes popping 3D effects.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Using it on a Samsung Galaxy tab running Froyo 2.3  It is a challenge to get books onto it via wifi since a recent update from Kindle.  Was pleased until recently.
B007SGM084|5.0|She loves it.  So much so she's reading it all for the 2nd time.  It has brought out a whole new side of her.
B0010T3UUC|5.0|These are great shoes and fit perfectly!!! I wear them to work and they are wonderful. Would buy another pair.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|I thought this would be a little more advanced but it turns out to be a standard calculator.<br />could have done without it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show constantly keeps me on the edge of my seat. It's fun to watch and the characters are convincing. What I find more amusing is the fact that there are people out there that believe this stuff is possible!
B0068THAGY|2.0|I went into this movie not knowing anything about what it was about. I came out of this moving still unsure of what it was about, save that they took almost two hours to tell a 5 minute story. The effects were definitely nice, but the movie was too dark for me to watch comfortably. I felt like I was missing out because so much was hidden from view in darkness; I spent almost the entire movie wondering what was going on and why. Disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Must read if you are middle aged, I don't think the younger group would care for it as much. Enjoy
B002WY65VU|5.0|im not or I wasn't a fan of obvious humor,but I laughed non stop to this movie! the cast is amazing!!!!!!! I am probably the last person to see it but im now im a witness!! Amen!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game a lot. I told my friends and they love it too. and it is so much fun.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This was one of my favorite apps ever. It is definitely worth the money u pay for it. Hope to see more apps was good as this one is.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down, although I was a bit disappointed in the writing of the ending.....just didn't flow like the rest of the book. No problem with way it ended, just the writing seemed off to me. However, I couldn't put it down....a very good read.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game. Kids enjoy it. They used steal my iPhone to play it, so I downloaded it on her tablet.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Had to read all threw but this one just didn't do it for me. Just not as good as the first two, but it was the finale.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is my favorite tablet game.  Really easy to use.  Set up nicely.  I definitely recommend it.  Fun and simple.
B004SBX112|3.0|Haven't time to play enough to gage it's value.  Question the locked icons,  How do you open and play?  Let me know
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|IF you enjoy playing games on your tablet or phone, you will probably enjoy this game.  Easy and fun to do.
1423140605|5.0|Another fantastic (no pun intended) installment in the Heroes of Olympus series. Just when you think Riordan can't make things become more tense and exciting, he pulls it off once again, and surpasses not only the reader's expectations but his own skills.  This book was so exciting and enticing that I couldn't put it down (even at the expense of my work, although I might write a paper on this book for a conference next year) and practically devoured it in a couple of days.<br /><br />I'm against offering detailed summaries in these types of reviews, so suffice it to say I highly recommend it, not only to fans of the series, but to new prospective readers (though, as it is a series, you might want to check the previous books first). The novel continues the story set in 'Son of Neptune', blowing up to even more 'Olympic' proportions (pun definitely intended there, sorry). Racing against time, meeting new and exciting personages from Greek and Roman mythology, lots of character growth (not in clichéd fantasy 'bildungsroman' traditions, but in believable scenarios), explosions, fights, etc, etc. If I build it up more, I'll do it more harm than good. Overall, 5 stars.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Great movie. I think of all the Batman movies, this one was great like the Dark Knight. A long one, but great.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I love The Walking Dead and was ecstatic to get this DVD.  Can't wait to get full season 3 when it becomes available.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|I've seen this many times, so it was finally time to own it. It's kookie and sad, but a really great movie. Some stunning acting.<br />I recommend the book as welll.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I am a Walking Dead addict.  Having this DVD got me caught up on Season 1 since I didn't discover the series until midway thru it.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A very fine film for the person who wants more than just special effects, but rather good writing and good acting. People over 40 will really enjoy this film. Very under-rated.
B004I2K4E8|2.0|Honestly, I'm a new comer to Les Mis. I've never seen the show, and until recently hadn't heard any of the songs. The upcoming release of the movie is what sparked my interest in the show. I listened to other versions via YouTube etc. I rented this version and I'm not all that impressed. There were a few pluses such as Samantha Barks performance as Epinone. I'm looking forward to her performance in the movie, Javarit's performance was quite good I thought. I've heard the 10th anniversary version of Lea Salonga singing Epinone and it was incredible, her Fantine--not so much. My biggest gripe however is Nick Jonas as Marius. Don't get me wrong, I think as a pop star he has some talent, however he doesn't have a strong enough voice to make these songs work. These songs just seem too operatic for Nick's voice.<br /><br />I'm hoping that the movie changes my \\"meh\\" feeling towards Les Misèrables. I get the feeling that with the right cast singing in the right vocal range and with the right emotion evident in their songs then I would really enjoy the show.
1250006341|5.0|This is a beautiful book / keepsake of the fab series. I gave it to my mother, a big fan, as a gift.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|You can't quit now the story ain't over yet.<br />What's not to like, the Imp is back, Jon Snow, Danaerys and her Dragons and.....maybe even a glimpse of Caitlan Stark as a Zombie, Now that is something for everybody.<br />You gotta get this one, the HBO series is lame compared to the books
B000X2H8G4|3.0|I bought this for my elderly mother, who is very hard of hearing,to use when watching TV. It works fine except that within a few days I have to replace the battery. Yes, she turns it off when not using it. I might have to look into buying a different product that doesn't need a new battery as often. That's my only complaint.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app there is really nothing wrong with it and it helps a whole lot with work and school plus its free .  If I where you I would get it.
B0022Y570K|5.0|Love it.  Easy to listen to all day.  just as good as all their other albums.  can't wait for everything new they bring up.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Not for nostalgia fans! Today's child may not have seen a reindeer or a chimney, and this movie makes a fun (and funny) attempt to bridge the gap between old and new. The whole family will enjoy the adventure when Santa meets high-tech!
B009AP2G26|5.0|i real real love it. so happy rhey got back togather.. can't till christmas show. keep it rockin you all.
B008S4FZHI|3.0|This book had far too much personal background detail to wade through which interfered with rather than enhanced the story line.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|The book is a mystery and an adventure, which is ideal for an escape from reality. It makes a good read, making it hard to put the book down. Can't wait to get to the end.
B0002KZAKS|4.0|I bought this to hook up to my Yamaha AV stereo. The mic sounds great, my only wish is that it had an on-off switch, that would be great and I would have paid more for it, so it is not quite perfect withouth that.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|You are your own gym is the sort of training manual for someone who wants to be in good shape for everyday natural fitness for all the routine physical needs of daily schedules. The beauty of this book is that these exercises can be done anywhere.
B008AYA7WE|3.0|It is hard to change orientation of blocks quickly. A different way to change the falling blocks is needed. Perhaps a screen touch.
B0096HID5M|4.0|Great movie.Brought back memories.I would recommend this movie to anyone born between 1960 thru 1975. I can't believe Tom Cruz stared in something like this. Even though he did ok.It doesnt hold a candle to Top Gun! Yoa Tom stick to the action films they're more your speed!!!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie I saw it in the theater. It is great in Blu-ray as I have other Blu-ray  Movies. I would recommend it.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I don't understand how people in the U.S. work or think, I'm from Greece, I own all GW seasons, and I loved the show, Hewitt CAN ACT, and this show is NOT A BOOST FOR HER EGO as some people are saying, anyway...It surprises me how many good shows have been shown the exit because of low rates, and that makes me wonder why people in the U.S. cannot understand a good show...seriously guys!<br /><br />The fifth season, takes a whole new direction, now we do not only see Melinda crossing over ghosts (sometimes dangerous ones) but also we get introduced in some new foe, the shadows, the shadows are after Melinda's son,Aiden,now Melinda faces the decision of taking away her son's gift by telling him he cannot see ghosts and that is all a lie, and changing him forever, or fight the Shadows that everybody seem to be afraid of...Amazing season and I would love if this show would continue...What can I say...
B007SGLZP8|5.0|He is a good writer. His novels are very exciting and is a good read. I would go and get it now.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|Enjoyed reading this book, but a large portion of it is regurgitated information from his first two books. As with his first two books, the links he provides to outside resources are probably worth the cost of purchase alone (kindle version anyway). Lots of interesting tools and sites out there which would take a lot of time to find on your own. If you enjoyed his other books, you'll like this one as well. If you didn't - you probably won't.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|The story was extremely boring, the dialogue was dull, and the bodies were far from stripper great!  Adam (Alex Pettyfer) didn't get enough air time and he was, by far, the sexiest man in the movie.  I barely made it to the end of the movie and was glad when I did!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|I typically don't buy blueray, but when I can get the physical version with the digital copy included for the same price it's should be a no brainer. If you're like me and prefer digital copies of movies, you may want to skip this buy.<br /><br />Turns out this \\"digital copy\\" doesn't actually provide a copy at all! Rather, it forces you to download a spammy app from Flixster, giving you a copy of the video that you can only use with that. You want to use your iTV to stream it from your computer? Too bad for you! Maybe you like managing which videos are on your iPad from the same interface- not so here, what you download and store is completely separate! You can probably take a guess what will happen when the authentication servers for the app go offline.<br /><br />So go to iTunes and buy it there, or spend your money here and then torrent a copy that doesn't include ridiculous DRM and other stupidity, but don't waste your money on this scam.
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|I cannot figure out how to set different Locations.  It is stuck in LA and I am no where near there.  Any help?
B0042XA2U4|4.0|I loved this book! Just be warned though, if you are expecting it to be like the movie it won't be. But personally, I liked it better this way! Such a great read. It gives you a lot to think about.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|The Racketeer is Grishams best work yet, I have read all his books!<br />A little different to his other books
B008IGP8QE|4.0|I haven't opened it yet. It's for my son for Xmas. I hope he loves it!!!  One of his favorite shows..
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another good novel from Flynn, featuring his number one character, Mitch Rapp.  Whenever Flynn puts out a new novel, I immediately buy it, I don't even need to read the cover.  This one was a little short, but the storyline is good as usual.  Not his best work, but I'm still a big fan.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie is amazing...now..be prepared..its slow paced and with violence interspersed throughout it...NOT FOR KIDS i promise...not for the under 15 set...violence is too graphic.  But if you can turn your head throught the violence...great movie great story you will love it....
B0021L8UPS|5.0|I bought this for my daughter who is a huge horror movie fan and she enjoyed it very much! 5*s!!

B00005JKQZ|5.0|I was taken on a wild ride I didn't expect. We would never know or understand life as the character in this true story led. I had to ask how can so many in this world function daily with this disorder. It was not understood in those days like we think it is today, but is it? People wanted him to act normal and expected him to be ok. He just couldn't and those that truely loved him came to understand him better and gave him the protection he needed until he grew beyond the extreme time of his illness. If you haven't seen this move get it and sit back and begin to be amazed by the Life and the sub-lives he led. You will see how this illness effect families and friends and even neighbors of those suffering with it.

B005NJU8PA|5.0|I pre ordered this book back in December 2011. Final got my copy a year later. This is my only gripe.<br /><br />This is a great book. The master learn shares his way of thinking about things. I especially enjoyed his bit about learning languages. My personal passion.<br /><br />This book is much larger then the Tim's 4 Hour Work Week and 4 Hour Body. The sections are independent of each other, so it is easy to pick out the parts that you want to read. Tim is also very good at making information digestible. So do not let the size of the book scare you off.<br /><br />Thanks Tim

B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game reminds me, for some reason, of Machinarium. Only it didn't seem as long. It was good. I suppose the target age for the game is a little younger than me. I liked it though. It was entertaining.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Bought as a gift. Haven't given to recipient yet, but they will enjoy watching the series on their big screen TV
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Game is good but had problems with it not accepting selections and kicking me out to the main game screen. It's a fun game just wish it ran without issues or having to redo.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|I saw this production last june at the Met. It was fantastic , now with this wonderfull set of DVDs plus the backstage documentary Wagner s dream, I was able to discovered more about that unique experience. The orquestra , with Levine and with Luisi sounds incredible, , highly recommended if you want to enjoy a superb cast of singers, all of them were great, the passion between Westbroek and Kaufmann at Die Walkure is unforgetable, Voigt,Terfel and Hunter Morris will take you into an amazing Ring. Dont Miss !
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is a fun puzzle game. It is definitely a great time killer. I would recommend it for long trips by road or air.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome series!!! These books just get better as you go. I just cannot fathom why anyone wouldn't love these books. I love all three. It would be AMAZING if this story would continue!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The layers of this book is engaging.  I liked the flow of the characters in each other's lives.  I especially liked that dreams were allowed to be developed and realized in the different tents in the circus.
0345803485|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series. It is a great love story that has the most wonderful ending. Terrific writing and I would give anything for this story to continue!!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I LOVE THIS APP!!<br /><br />Easy to use.<br />Doesn't take up too much resources.<br /><br />But, it constantly updates...I mean all the time.....with useless feature additions. Furthermore, I wish I didn't need an extra app just to update this app. You have to download the Amazon Appstore just to update this app, which is ridiculous.<br /><br />Otherwise, I'm totally satisfied and would recommend this app for not only downloading your favorite YouTube videos, but converting them to MP3 (if it's music videos).
B007IXWL2C|5.0|All of these are terrific! I cannot say enough good things about these books. I want there to be more!!!!!!
B009EAO38C|5.0|Fantastic, great background music for studying and reading.  The Piano Guys are great.  I look forward to future works of theirs.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|DC knows how to make a animated movie, and just because its a \\"cartoon\\" does not mean it is a terrible movie. It has a great story, memorable characters, and great action scenes so get it know. (also if you get this confused with the dark knight RISES you are a idiot)

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Just like all of his books, the pages keep turning, the characters are really interesting, and it's just entertaining to read. Wasn't his best &#34;story&#34; but just reading anything that Grisham writes is a treat and an escape.
009957375X|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" is not just A Christmas story, but one of THE Christmas stories -- not only is it instantly recognizable by pretty much everybody, but it's relentlessly copied and spoofed in countless Christmas specials. But taken just by itself, Charles Dickens' yuletide novella is a pretty bleak and bittersweet affair, with brilliant imagery and lots of ghostly weirdness.<br /><br />Scrooge is... well, a scrooge -- a professional miser who hates Christmas, goodwill, charity, puppies, kittens, his relatives, his employees, and virtually everything else except money.<br /><br />And on Christmas Eve, his dead partner Jacob Marley comes back, wrapped with supernatural chains, and claims that Scrooge is doomed to the same fate. But he has a chance at redemption: three ghosts representing will visit him that night, taking him on a guided tour of Christmases past, present and yet to come.<br /><br />So Scrooge is transported on a trio of hourlong trips through time. The childlike Ghost of Christmas Past takes him to his bleak childhood, when he was less jaded and hard. The jolly Ghost of Christmas Present takes him to people's homes on the very next morning, specifically of of his nephew and the poor miner Bob Cratchit. And finally a Ringwraith-like spirit gives him a glimpse of Christmas years in the future... a bleak and terrible future, unless he changes his ways.<br /><br />You can read plenty of symbolism into a story like \\"A Christmas Carol\\"; I've heard speculation about Dickens' father, the Industrial Revolution, spiritualism, and all sorts of other stuff. But at its heart, \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is the most powerful when appreciated for its story alone -- a story about a greedy, miserable man who redeems himself by learning to love all humanity.<br /><br />Dickens' writing is utterly brilliant here. Most of the book is bleak, grimy and painted in shadows, with Dickens only rarely holding back from showing the dark situation of England's poor. A great example is the symbolic children Want and Ignorance (\\"a stale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched, and twisted them, and pulled them into shreds\\"). As for the Grim-Reaperlike third ghost, it's the stuff of nightmares.<br /><br />But all isn't dark here. Occasionally Dickens splashes it with moments of crystalline brilliance (\\"It held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand; and... its dress trimmed with summer flowers\\"). And as dark as the book is, Dickens offers hope for the future.<br /><br />He also does a brilliant job with Scrooge, \\" a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire.\\" Having worked hard to make us hate Scrooge, Dickens then deftly displays his skill at slowly revealing how Scrooge became who and what he is, and slowly redeeming him.<br /><br />Charles Dickens created one of the greatest Christmas stories with \\"A Christmas Carol\\" -- bah humbugs, merry Christmases and all.

B008578PMU|5.0|THis was an awesome movie. I am mad that I didn't go to the theater to see it because I'm sure it was even better there will the sound.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love the way you can get harder as you wish. Some days my brain can only handle one suit. I really enjoy the simplicity and the challenge at same time.. easy to learn.
0470474874|5.0|This is an awesome  book for anyone who works a lot with excel. Keep this on your desk for quick references. You thought you knew Excel, you had no idea.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple is a very exciting game that shows that your hands have skills, which I do..... its really fun and really cool. its good to play in my free time
B0083GR6Y6|5.0|So I am one who actually watches movies for entertainment and not to be a critic like so many people seem to think they are, but this was a great movie. Liam Neeson is not to be eff'd with. Between this and Taken this dude kicks ass!
B008OOYALE|5.0|good game it need Internet thou if it didn't need internet it would be better but other then that its awsone
B0031RS4V6|5.0|I wait impatiently each year for the next Jack Reacher story. What can I say? He is the best fiction character ever and I hope there will be more Reacher novels to come. The plots are always different, the characters lifelike the pace never lets up.
0345803485|2.0|I didn't even finish the first book, it's interesting but it goes on and on about this so called contract ! I can't even imagine what the 2nd and 3rd book must be like !  Halfway through the first book I completely lost interest !  Maybe  because I am from Amsterdam and grew up in a very liberal country,  that I did not think this book deserved so much attention ! lol
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Most entrancing book I've read in a long time.  Makes you really understand the time period and how things might have happened.
B00322PK2G|5.0|Excelente reloj. A mi hija le encantó el diseño, el color y la funcionalidad. Lo recomiendo con total tranquilidad. Comprenlo sin dudar.
1407130366|5.0|I have an advanced reader and I held her off of reading this until I felt she was mature enough to handle the subject matter.  She had read all of the Harry Potter series, and seemed to handle the subject matter well in both.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It is a wonderful book I'm sad that its over though and I really need a mother hunger game book
0316232955|5.0|I love The Land Of Stories and I'm obsessed with it, but Chris managed to top himself again with Struck By Lightning: The Carson Phillips Journal. This book is my favorite ever now!<br />The writing is brilliant! Full of sarcasm and such an awesome humor, but  at the same time it will make you sob.
B0030MM68O|5.0|I am not a huge fan of war movies but wanted to watch this one because of its academy award wins and things I had heard about it. It is extremely well done and the acting and the way it is shot makes you forget it is not a documentary; you truly felt you were following these guys around. The film did a great job of capturing the brevity of the situation and the hideous outcomes that occur when human bodies are in proximity to explosive devices without constantly having blood and body parts flying all over the place. There  is some gore but it is not the point of the film and is not sensationalized. it is not a light film but certainly is deserving of the many awards it won.
B009JBZH54|5.0|For the price, this box set is amazing.  Better, its exactly all I need.  It doesn't have the extra, limited edition trinkets that come with it, which is perfectly fine for me, it costs less, unlike the Marvel Universe, Phase 1 box set that comes with a cube and brief case... (what a waste, and it doesn't fit nicely into my beautiful movie collection).  Starting with the set itself, the box and case are of good quality.  The special features are the ones that have been previously seen in the individual releases.  This does mean that there are no exclusive features included with this box set.  To tell you the truth, for this price, I'm not going to miss not having any new exclusive content.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Thumbs up, merchandise arrived in specified time and in great shape, the product is what I expected and beyond that
B004YW4L5K|5.0|If you're a Neil Gaiman fan, pick this one up! The story is great and in true Neil Gaiman fashion, you have no clue what's actually going on. You get to discover everything as the main character does. It'll keep you engaged until the very end.
6305428042|5.0|Movie was a great price I have purchased other movies from Amazon and have been fully satisfied with my purchase.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|I really love this cd!  Rihanna did the damn thing with this album.  It's not one bad song on there.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. It makes you feel all emotions suspense, hope, laughter, and sadness.
B0051X56FK|3.0|This cd is okay. The bonus cd sucks and I only liked one song on there. B is a great artist, but her cd's are just &#34;okay&#34;.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. Hugh Howey is a wonderfully creative writer, who can really move a story along!
0547884591|4.0|Im a big fan of Ferris' work. Im a person who likes to learn hiw to be decent t lots of things.....or at least experience them. I love the little tips all through the book. It seems a little crazy at first, but I get it. Im yet to actually cook anything, but perhaps I'll update my review when I do.
B007HACDLK|5.0|While I loved the two prequels, it's great that &#34;The Last Man&#34;  brings us back to the present geopolitical stage. Always finish Vince's books and want another to read. I might have to re-read them all in order until next year's book!
B008DL466C|3.0|This album has some smooth songs on here and I dig the production. However, if you're looking for lyrical prowess, this album isn't going to interest you. Then again, if you're looking for a lyrical rapper, you shouldn't be looking at Wiz in the first place. Money, women and weed. That's it. As Wiz himself says in &#34;Time&#34;, &#34;stickin' to the script, no new lines.&#34;<br /><br />It is miles ahead of Cabin Fever 2, his last mixtape, which was abysmal.<br /><br />If you like Wiz's commercial stuff, it's a good listen. My standout track is &#34;Paperbond&#34;.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Solid and quirky tips I've grown to love from Tim. Tried a few of the recipes. Great read so far...
B0052SF6CM|5.0|I had heard a few of these songs before the album came out, and had loved Ready for the Weekend, so I was pumped for this. He didn't disappoint. There are a few duds here, but not very many.<br /><br />This will probably end up my most spun album this year. My standout track (tough choice) is Feel So Close.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|This case is so handy.  I use my Kindle Fire HD every day and this one seems to work the best.  It's leather, and unlike some of the others out there in the market the spots match up to plug in for both power and on switch.  I recently got hooked on a game and since I play it often, this case protects my KFHD while I am in between games or reading which is the main thing I do.  My books are my joy and I have been very happy with both my device and this cover.  You won't go wrong with this one!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I had wondered if this show was going to be able to express the excitement and intensity of the comic after I watched season 2.  Season 3 brings it though,  There may still be some needless melodrama thrown in but when the action gets going it is quite enjoyable.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Love this show.  Season 2 is better than season 1 ... just great... campy and fun to watch.  the best
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|One of the best produced cd out there. No need to explain the sounds from this artist. She is great performer with the golden voice. This cd has some great tracks,with a lot of hits on it.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|very crude humor but still funny. I gave the 3 star rating for the language and humor other than that it's a fun movie for grownups to watch.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Absoultly love this game!! Great graphics and good storyline. Wish it never ended. Looking for another game! Puzzles were good too...there was only one I couldn't pass.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Can hardly wait for the final book of the trilogy.  Vivid characters, historically factual and tight writing.  I'm a real Follett fan!
0920668364|5.0|This book seriously looks brand new, except for a little bit of writing on a blank page before the title page. I would've never guessed it was used if the writing wasn't there! Excellent!
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|I have tried to install three times now. Each time taking ten minutes. After which telling me to uninstall apps. I don't have enough room. I've insatalled apps before letting me know ahead of time to free up room. I love G5 games but really. I've lost my patience.
B001HMSFFC|4.0|If you loved the series, this movie is a sweet continuation- it's fun to see the characters a few years later.
B004GKMV16|1.0|Unfortunately my wifi connection faded as I was downloading this book so although I have paid for it I cannot read it and therefore cannot report on it.
B00770KR7W|4.0|I got this for Stop-Motion animation purposes and plus I am also a huge Halo fan. The detail in the toy is fantastic. Every thing from palms, under the boot, and neck are well detailed. Even has a damaged paint part in the armor to make it look more realistic and I love it. My only problem with it though is that the articulation is bad and awkward. It comes with a well detailed Assault Rifle as well but you can't hope to have MC holding the weapon correctly. It works better with just one arm instead of the standard way. I have never owned Halo 3 series spartans, but I got the impression that they did not have much restrictions when it came to movement. Same case applies to the Reach set (which I do own one). With this figure though, I'd say this has many restrictions and it defiantly won't work for a smooth stop-motion film. Be a good background character like as a corpse, but nothing more.<br />As I said, I love the detail that was out into this, and I enjoy the new design. However, Articulation just wasn't as good as any previous spartan figures I have purchased (Reach Spartan and the Halo Legends version of MC). It could just be my figure, but I highly doubt it. For a Halo lover, it defiantly suits you and is a must have. For any of you film makers wanting to use it? I'd go with any of the previous Master Chief sets until they come out with a new series of the Halo 4 figures.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|I have read most of Conan-doyles books when I was much younger but I still enjoy the complex twists and turns and I am always trying to beat Sherlock Holmes to the conclusion.Loved It,will try and load some more.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|The only thing I wish I could do would be to post a new post on someone’s wall and not just comment on their post.  Overall very nice app.
B002HK9HR8|5.0|&#34;Chinatown&#34; sums up the classic Film Noir as as no other...and it has terrific antecedents (see: &#34;Maltese Falcon&#34;, &#34;Double Indemnity&#34; ...for two), its cynicism and sorrow are earned, the plot twists are as adult/intricate as any thinking person would desire (desire being the leit-motif),and as inevitable as gravity...and finally understandable.<br /><br />And ,if you are a star-gazer, Nicholson is your everyman...just a bit bigger than life.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love Maroon 5!! This cd didnt disappoint. Listening to it over and over. Might drive my kids crazy. lol
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of great fun.  my kids really like it especially the fifty year old one. lots of variety and challenges
B009HEJXFS|2.0|We were not impressed with the movie at all...no wonder it didn't do well in the movie theatre!  Will Smith was great, as usual, but even he couldn't pull this movie through!
B004HW7JMO|3.0|I gave the Spartacus  collection as a gift and enjoyed it but was not impressed about the story line.  He did enjoy the action.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|Great movie. Although it may seem like a movie for kids, this dramedy is full of excitement and dry humor.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|Not a great story line. I feel like this has been done before.  I guess this would be OK for kids but not Pixar's best. The title is slightly misleading.
B004HO6I2E|5.0|Theis movie is very funny and well worth the cost, it showed up as expected and on time with no damage and picture quality is very good.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|when I first got mu kindle fire my friend said that I should get dragonvale and I looked for it but it was not there I was so hummed. but now it is!! It is a addictive game!!!
B005JSM5YW|4.0|I really enjoyed this film as it was funny, well acted and pretty realistic when it came to showing how people behave when falling in / out of love.<br /><br />Laughed a lot. Smiled a lot. Great date movie.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Simply alot of fun.Yes they blow things up for the heck of it and the story line is totally formula but hey if you saw The Expendables 1 you should know that already. Just sit back and be entertained.
B004N66XYE|4.0|I enjoyed this series in the original, and this adaptation is a lovely chance to revisit the characters and situations.
B009LREA1S|5.0|Seriously, this is a rating system for rating THE MOVIE.<br /><br />If you have a problem with your delivery, or you think DVD sucks or any of that crap, don't put a 1 star because of it. I don't understand, are you stupid or just completely oblivious as to how this system is meant to work?<br /><br />99% of the 1 star reviews are mostly complaining about delivery or something completely unrelated to the movie itself. Get over yourselves and use your brain cells for once in your life.
B009GESJH2|5.0|This is one of Kid Rocks Best.  More of a Soulful sound.  If you liked Born Free you will love this new release.
B001Q9J4PG|3.0|This novel was a good reference for Jack Ryan Story characters and related actions referenced in other novels.  I had not read this novel prior to Executive Order and Locked On.  Because of references to the Rainbow Six group I read this novel.  It had the typical Clancy writing but not as good as his other novels.  The begining with the terrorists on the airplane seemed a bit forced to introduce action. It was unnecessary.
B009OA57MI|4.0|Its a great game I like the fact that you can domissions that some else designed it keeps things exciting
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is one of the games that helps me to relax before going to bed.I also play this game when I go pick up my daughter from work. and I have to wait for her.It is enjoyable.
B00DB624GS|5.0|danny  kirwan joined, and gave birth  to a  new  and  more interesting fleetwood mac  , but  everyone credited peter green . half of the songs  are kirwan's .  he had  more songs , and  sadly , his stellar blues  songs are  found  only on compilations . he had  already  mastered the blues before he joined, and  his originals are as great as anyone in the blues business.  jeremy was  not  keen to write original songs (  the main  reason why  danny was  added,  so as to  to ease green's songwriting  ), but two of jeremy's songs should be part of this deluxe set ( perhaps on  a second disc ? ).  they are  ''mean old fireman'', and ''allow me one more show\\" . jeremy's  creative  best  occured  with kirwan on  board , especially  for 'kiln house'.  as for peter , well, peter's best instrumentals (''albatross'' and ''underway'')  also feature  kirwan. (peter admitted this decades later , therefore,  two of  peter's best  songs owe  kirwan  a writing/ guitar  credit , or at least enormous  thanks . by  18  kirwan  was  already  a  master of two part  guitar harmony , and  peter was  not  .  after 'then play on', peter green  would not be unusually  creative  , but  danny kirwan , who  mastered  many styles ,  and  fortunately , not just  blues, would go on  create  many  more fabulously wonderful songs .  a deluxe edition  ought to be  adding  ''albatross'',  ''man of the world'',  and these originals  by kirwan( ''like it this way'', ''only you'', ''something inside of me'', ''when i see'','' love it seems'' , ''loving kind'',''early morning comes'','' talk to me woman'',  ''jigsaw puzzle blues'' )  danny  kirwan's health finally caused him to lose  his  magic, and  he remains far from the music  business.  he is inexcusably the least known musician truly deserving of the term  superstar/supergiant ,  and unquestionably  the  true genius of  fleetwood mac , and  he  is  so much  much  more than  just that, for  danny kirwan  is the 20th century's greatest  and most beautiful  singer, songwriter, and guitarist .dinary every day beauty. danny has been homeless and in shelters for about 35 years. if any one wants to pray for danny  that would be nice.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Wes Anderson continues to make charming fun filled films with quirky characters that create their own world, enjoyed this film from start to finish. Hope it does well come awards season.
0802473156|4.0|There's a lot of truth in this book, and I'd recommend it to anyone, whether they're married, or looking for love. Chapman's 5 love languages make sense, and the stories he uses to introduce them are engaging. This book led to a lot of conversation with my wife, and our marriage is stronger for it. It's a good starting point. There's a Ladies' Mag style \\"test\\" in the back to get a feel for your love language. We cheated and did that first.<br /><br />The only reasons I'd take off a star are:<br />1) Several of the languages are dealt with better elsewhere. As I read a couple of the chapters, I couldn't help but think that some of the languages were dealt with better in How to Make Friends and Influence People, though not in the specific context of marriage.<br />2) Feeling loved and being able to express love are #1 in a marriage, but there's more to making a marriage work, most notably conflict resolution. A book like 10 Great Dates goes much more into nuts and bolts of making a marriage work.<br /><br />If you're looking to make your marriage better, by all means, read this book with your spouse, but by no means stop there!
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Diana's been professionally recording for almost 20 years...Surely she deserves the chance and support of her fans (new & old) to try something a bit different. I myself, listen to a wide variety of music and Diana's choices fit right in my tastes (jazz, blues, R&B, roots). The folks that be hatin on this have a very limited palate of tastes and that's sad. They dont like change. For a musician/entertainer to grow and keep things fresh, its necessary to try new things. Why cant you? Give DK a break
B000FVQLQQ|3.0|I love the movie. However, the movie was moving around within the case. it was not even pushed into place where it should have been.  Also, it keeps skipping.  I might just have to return and get a new one.
B001CTDH76|5.0|This role is perfectly suited to Simon's charm and wit. He plays the Patrick Jane character beautifully. All the characters are wonderful. I would have to say my favorite episode from the season is the episode set at a corporate retreat. The prologue was fantastic! I hope this show lasts a long time and that CBS doesn't cancel it before the Red John story is wrapped. It would be horrible not to at least give this show a fitting closure.
B005AAVFDQ|5.0|I have loved Nirvana since 1989! I have been purchasing their albums for years. This is a great addition to my 38 cd collection. However, I ordered it brand new from Amazon, and the live DVD was not included. Which it clearly states comes along with this package. I payed more so it included the DVD, and it wasn't in there!!! The package had not been opened, so I can't blame it on Amazon, but I still got ripped off.
0736092269|4.0|So far ive found this resource helpful! So far ive used it to creat work-outs. Good illustrations for understanding the movement of muscle systems.
B0058UXHHK|4.0|I ordered this book for light reading, to keep in my library for a time when I needed a \\"no-brainer\\".  When I began reading it, that's exactly what I thought it was.  As a matter of fact, I thought it was a little far fetched and silly, but kept on reading just out of curiosity (and because I needed something painless to read).  Well, it was such a surprise.  Not only was it light, the characters were whimsical and the author's use of humor really made it a fun read.  The plot was pretty obvious, but as I continued to read on, it was fun to see how the main character worked through her inhibitions in a very convincing manner.<br /><br />If you're looking for an easy read with a humorous, fun edge, this is just the book.  I couldn't put it down once I got into the story.  While somewhat simple, it's still a humorous read and perfect for that time when a reader needs a light-hearted, feel good book as opposed to something deep or dark and mind provoking.<br /><br />Kudos to the author for introducing the reader to such a fun book with a whimsical twist.  I loved it!
B000BO0LKY|5.0|I don't know if certain cuss words are muted or that's the way she recorded it in the studio. One of the song skips at the beginning but great product, fast shipping!
B00633W614|5.0|Could not put this down.  I love the characters and the historical setting with the war build up as a backdrop.  Harry, Giles and Deakins remind me of my son and his friends.  Can't wait to continue their saga.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|at level 12  kind of boring...but still addictive and i will continue to play till i reach level 30 . its a must try
B007EECSFA|5.0|Another Kate Morton hit. When I started, it was a little confusing. But quickly I couldn't put it down. There is so much about relationships and forgiveness. She is an incredible writer.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Perfect!  All 8 movies, in one package, and all are Widescreen!  Not sure where negative reviews came from - I say buy with confidence that you are getting what is advertised and what you expect. Very happy with purchase.
0984183523|4.0|It is a good book but there are only few sections which really stand out and cover advice which is different from what Victor has already delivered before. Is it worth the price? Yes.
B006TLFIAQ|5.0|Ever since I saw Expendables 1 i fell in love with statham. Good looking and tough. I now have Expendables 2 and plan to order more statham movies also. He and Stallone are great together. Like to see them do more movies as a team.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|We wanted to buy this movie since it was from the same director/writer of Alien.  We love science fiction movies.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have so much fun playing this game. you have to be patient tho, unless you want to spend real money to get to higher levels. but all in all, a great game
B00A77II0U|5.0|I never buy a game without trial but I read the reviews &amp; had to buy. This is a fun and interesting game works great on kf. the zoom is great. great graphics fun story line. I highly recommend. this game!!
B0089ZEEYG|3.0|&#34;Catch the falling items&#34; game, been done a million times. Looked pretty good on Toshiba thrive, it's probably best to play these on a tablet.
B000I186FW|4.0|The story in this movie is very interesting and thought provoking.  It kind of parallels the way our societies have been moving lately with powerful governments and correuption.  I enjoyed the movie but wish it would have been less violent.  A good story can be told without so much blood.
1442359315|5.0|This book gives a whole new outlook about what's on the other side. Makes sense and is very interesting not only spiritually but intellectually also.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|This movie was way better than I expected. It was so funny. Rebel Wilson is great! I can't wait to watch it again.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I'm a big Nelson DeMille fan, and generally like the John Corey character.  This book may have changed all that.  I'm 50% in, do I stay or do I go?  I'm not one to put down a book that I've started but nothing ever happens in this book!  I enjoy sarcastic wit as much as the next person but this was overkill.  The character used to be darkly amusing, now he's just downright annoying.  I'm not giving up on DeMille but I'm going to read the next books' reviews more carefully before I purchase.
B00A81NFAS|5.0|I never write reviews, but I just HAD to for this film. I highly recommend it. Great dialog, great acting, great script, etc. Oscar worthy!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game. Tons of fun. I keep looking forward to getting more coins so I can keep playing for prizes and power ups.
B007HACDLK|5.0|i enjoyed this story, as i did Flynn's previous stories. all of his stories are interesting and keeps me on my toes until the last page!!
B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|I'm a little biased because I love sports movies. I especially love sports movies that are &#34;based on a true story&#34;. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill make an unexpectedly great duo, and Beane's relationship with his daughter is precious.
B003IEJZUG|5.0|I wanted to read this before I saw the movie and I am so glad I did.  It was beautifully written and you felt you were with him on this misadventure out on the Pacific Ocean.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|I have almost all of The Black Keys's albums and Thickfreakness is by far my favorite. Hard Row and Have Love Will Travel are two of the best songs, but they are all well done. The gritty vocals and accompaniment are spot on blues.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|I would recommend this item to anyone considered in the junior class of a certified film production class. Classic scenario from the start; you can feel the irony of comedic relief. :)
B008XG1X18|4.0|The app is great for browsing Pinterest on my Kindle, however, I haven't figured out how to pin things from other websites on the Kindle...
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|This movie was way too twisted for my taste.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to any one.  This movie wasn't plausible in my mind.  I'm sure there are people who disagree with me and may like it.
B003498SDA|5.0|Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise make an unlikely pair in this fast-paced flick, but, like all Michael Mann action flicks, it is beautifully executed. While there are guns, danger, darkness, and fear, there is also beautiful music, stunning camera work, and characters with great depth.
1402545355|3.0|This is less of one cohesive story and more short vignettes that tie into one novel. For a long drive where one is falling asleep and waking up again this was a good thing. I did enjoy this audiobook the narrator was enjoyable to listen to but at times with road noise was hard to hear. Precious Ramotswe, the lady detective, was an interesting character and I enjoyed listening to a story that was set outside of the United States.<br /><br />Botswana where the story was set played a big role in the stories. Some of the vignettes where very specific to Africa and couldn't happen anyplace else. Witch doctor's and corruption cases are solved by Romotswe in often funny and satisfying ways that don't seem to be a stretch of reality in the slightest.<br /><br />I would recommend this novel to those that want something to listen to on a drive.
B008VO3PA4|5.0|The best thing in this book are the pictures cuuase they are really cute and you would die if you had kitties like this!
0515149489|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book mostly because I love Labs and this book was full of them. Fiona has three very well behaved adults that she uses for search and rescue and Simon has a lab puppy that is well terrorizing and chewing everything until Fiona starts to train him and give him some drive.<br /><br />\\"She looked past him, cooked her head. She saw the pup through the window now. a Lab-retriever mix, she judged--and currently very busy. \\"Your dog's eating your truck.\\" \\"What?\\" He spun around. \\"F***!\\" ...  He wrenched open the door. \\"...what's wrong with you?\\" The puppy, obviously unafraid, unrepentant, leaped into the man's arms and slathered his face with eager kisses.\\" (p.21)<br /><br />At his wits ends he comes to Fiona which is rather humorous for a first meeting.<br /><br />\\"Tell me you'll take him. I'll pay room and board.\\" \\"It doesn't work like that.\\" ... \\"I take him, I take you. ... If you're not going to commit to the dog, to his training, his health and well-being, I'll help you find a home for him.\\" \\"I'm not a quitter.\\" Simon jammed his hands in his pockets as once again Fiona threw the balls. \\"Besides, my mother would . . . I don't want to go there. She's got this idea that since I moved out here, I need companionship. It's a wife or a dog. She can't give me a wife, so...\\" (p. 23-24).<br /><br />As Fiona begins to train Jaws and Simon both man and dog learn and become more attached to each other. Living on a small island Fiona and Simon are in close quarters. And while they both claim that the other is not their type it becomes clear pretty fast, in Romance style, that they are attracted and interested.<br /><br />I liked that there were dogs in this novel but I found that while some of them had very distinct personalities, Fiona's dogs didn't really stand out as being all that different to me. Thus I had a hard time remembering which dog was which.<br /><br />I have also started to notice a new theme in the non-series books. Female character is strongwilled and doesn't need a man. Man comes along, woman likes the man but tries not to. Man and Woman end up together. Woman is in danger but doesn't want help, and feels that asking for help is a burden to those around her. Man insists on being their for her even when she tries to push him away. Man and Woman realize they are in love, not at the same time of course. Danger becomes more prominent and Man is there for Woman when danger comes to climax. Man and Woman are very happy and are getting married.<br /><br />I'm getting a little bit tired of this new plot cycle and wonder if maybe I just overlooked it in the older books. The characters are still what make the books interesting. I liked the characters in here just didn't like the story as much and the plot didn't interest me as much as it could have. I guess I liked the mystical older books a bit more than this one.<br /><br />For those that like Nora Roberts and love dogs this is probably a good read for you.
B009MO5G90|4.0|While this was overall an enjoyable movie, it felt distinctly lacking compared to the previous movie.  This one felt like there was quite a bit of characterization left on cutting room floor.  I emjoyed the movie, but it is one of the weakest entries in the series.  Seeing so many of the original actors again was pretty cool though.
B004E3XD1W|4.0|I really enjoyed reading his book. I started the series by reading Fire which happens to chronologically be the first book but most people place it after Graceling. That being said the three books Graceling, Fire, and Bitterblue can be read in any order. Bitterblue (I have not had the chance to read it yet) takes place after Graceling but I don't think the story is such that you need to read the others to understand it.<br /><br />I appreciated the story and the fact that Katsa was a strong female character. Independent and able to make make decisions for herself it is no surprise that she feels as though she is trapped in a mans world. Her desire to be free and to do only as she wants leads her to make decisions that can be viewed as feminist, and they are by many that read the book. Yes, Katsa is a strong woman and she stands up for herself but she has to learn to stand up for herself. She is Graced, with killing, and that does seem to help her along the way but it is also something she must control. In little ways Katsa is strong from the beginning.<br /><br />\\"\\"Hmm,\\" Randa said, smirking at her silence. \\"Your sword is the only bright thing about you. Pay attention, girl. I'm sending you after this traitor. You're to kill him, in public, using your bare hands, no weapons. Just him, no one else. I'm sure we all hope you've learned to control your bloodlust by now.\\" ... When the soldiers caught the underlord, they dragged him to the square of the nearest village, where a scattering of startled people watched, slack jawed. Katsa instructed the soldiers to make the man kneel. In one motion she snapped his neck. There was no blood; there was no more than an instant's pain. Most in the crowd didn't even realize what had happened. ... After that his commands included specifics: blood and pain, for this or that length of time.\\" (p. 28-29)<br /><br />She is only 10 when that happened and in small ways she continues to disobey her uncle the king.<br /><br />She makes who she feels about marriage very clear from the start of the book, and this is where the feminism comes in. Because she does not want to marry and be held by anyone she is considered a feminist. I'm not sure I agree with this I think she is just struggling to maintain her own freedom and doing it in the only way she sees. Yes she does turn down marriage she does choice sexual freedom but I don't think this is something new in Young Adult fiction. Maybe it isn't what popular fiction such as Twilight would promote but I think there are plenty of better books out there with strong female characters who are sexually free. (So maybe this is just a comment on other people's view of the book but I think it is worth knowing).<br /><br />The characters are strong and enjoyable and the book is a fast read. I liked spending time with a confident female character and men who were willing to let her take the lead.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|This is lovely case and a bit unusual as compared to my cases for my Gen 1 Kindle Fire (7 inch) and older Kindles.  The larger Kindle Fire snaps into a hard plastic bracket.  The bracket can swing freely and rotate thus enabling it to fit into one of the three slots (different angle for each slot) allowing me to adjust the angle for various positions.  When reading, there is a nice strap to put my hand in so I can hold it very comfortably.  When the case is closes, a quality elastic band ensures the case stays shut. The case is nicely padded and protects the Kindle Fire very well. Opening the case immediately turns the Kindle on, which is nice and like many of the cases for iPads.  The only negative is that the case has to be open when charging as I cannot rotate the plastic holder the necessary 180 degrees in order to plug-in my charger. Would give it five stars if I could charge it with the case closed.  (Love the purple color of the quality leather!)<br /><br />Update:  Due to the stiffness of the rotational component, I initially could not rotate the Kindle within the bracket enough so I could charge it with the case closed. Well I tried again and yes, it did rotate the necessary 180 degrees..so do not be worried or hesitant to firmly turn the device within the bracket. I am now 100% pleased with the case. Very happy with this purchase!
B004XZR63M|5.0|An absolute must read for anyone who has worked hard for any numbers of years and is looking down at that puddle on the ground showing the reflection of their own face.
B005J7CRNC|5.0|Every one of these young men are outstanding on their own but as Il Divo-their are no words.  For the record, sabastian  is my favorite.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is really good just like the other diary of a wimpy kid books!!!!!!!!!! I hope there will be more books coming out soon!!!!!!!!

B00936A0RU|4.0|Dark, dank, ugly and cruel is the setting is Franklin County, Virginia where this apparently true story takes place. The cast is what attracts people to attend this movie, but as far as a story is concerned it is all harsh and bloody and poorly developed despite how hard the actors try with the script they've been given (Nick Cave adapted Matt Bondurant's novel `The Wettest County in the World').<br /><br />The infamous Bondurant brothers - Forrest (Tom Hardy), Howard (Jason Clarke) and Jack (Shia LaBeouf) - assisted by a rickets crippled boy named Crickett (Dane DeHaan) run a successful bootlegging operation during the depression, up in the mountains of Franklin County, Virginia. The only new person to be admitted into the Bondurant clan is Maggie Beauford (Jessica Chastain) who has escaped Chicago nightclub life for the `peace' of the countryside. Also from Chicago comes crooked Special Deputy Charles Rakes (Guy Pearce) who is after a share of the brothers' profits. Compounding their troubles, the local competition is elbowing in on their activities. Forrest's boisterous defiance and Cricket's knack for moonshine production help the brothers gain a local monopoly. When Forrest is wounded as tension with Rakes escalates, Jack, initially the timid one, must prove his worth against local gangster Floyd Banner's (Gary Oldman) mob, and we see him metamorphose into a cocky exhibitionist in his attempts to woo the off-limits preacher's daughter, Bertha (Mia Wasikowski).<br /><br />The actors make these people memorable, especially Tom Hardy who simply mumbles his way through life unafraid of death or any outside foes. The rest of the cast is strong given the weak script and the overall atmosphere of the Depression era bootlegging business is brought sharply into focus by director John Hillcoat with the aid of a fine musical score by Nick Cave. The story is bleak and cruel and there is a lot of extreme violence. But is does create a mood.  Grady Harp, December 12
B004U8VX2M|2.0|Unfortunately I saw two seasons of Downton Abbey before I saw Upstairs, Downstairs so I am spoiled.  Downton Abbey is such a better series.  But it was interesting comparing the two.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I won't repeat story lines...enough reviewers have done that. I finished this book some time ago, and find myself still thinking about the characters and their lives. I wanted Book 3 the minute I finished. I read both of these back-to-back, and I STRONGLY recommend that any reader read Book 1 first. It is really essential to understanding the people and their backgrounds, and some of the historical secrets that are revealed to the characters in this story. Although not entirely about the war years, Book 1 was centered in the time frame that contained WW1, and Book 2 begins in the 30's, some 15 years later, and contains the WW2 years. I have to wonder where book 3 will lead us. I can't wait to find out.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Great movie and I mean, do I really need to explain why? Channing Tatum stripping? Even if he didn't get completely naked, who cares? My mind was perfectly capable of creating that image on its own. His dirty dances were enough for me!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I have difficulty separating Book 1 and Book 2, as I read them back-to-back. Obviously I found it interesting enough to read #2 immediately. The characters were fully-drawn, their lives and challenges engrossing, and the historical setting so realistic I felt pulled right into them. I also learned a lot, which is one of the very best benefits of well-written fiction. I can pretty much guarantee that you will immediately want to read Book2, as I did, and want Book 3 too, which unfortunately isn't around quite yet. One more bonus: I read this on Kindle, and unlike so many Kindle books, there were no missed words, improper forms (i.e. they're or their) or misspelling that slid through a spell-checker.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Commanding performance by Stan Lee. I enjoy seeing him in all of his movies. Can't for the next Avengers to come out.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book grabbed me from the first page and had to force myself not to look ahead.  It was a quick read for me because of how the story developed and I couldn't put it down.
B00AE2J93I|4.0|I enjoyed this film - cute storyline, good animation, and loved the few twists at the end.  I would recommend this film for people who like movies like Nightmare Before Christmas etc.  It's good for kids and has a lot of subtle adult humor peppered though the story.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I liked it, my spouse fell asleep..... a definition of independent film? The name actors disguise its dry quirky humor.<br />Beyond quirky, a sharp critique of bullying and being something other than an average main stream adolescent through the lens of boy scouts and coming of age.
0307891372|3.0|I got this guide because a lot of people were raving about it even though a few friends told me I can get anything online I want to know.  I like paper guides to be able to thumb through and look at.  It's a decent guide, and the most use I got out of it was the maps and finding where to go in the dungeons.  The crafting and spells and such were mildly helpful as well.  I'd only recommend this if you really want a hard copy of something to look at while not playing the game if you love the game.
030759565X|5.0|I am a huge fan of the Smitten Kitchen blog, and the cook book doesn't disappoint - it is quite simply sublime.  I love the photography which is a signature of the Smitten Kitchen website and the stories around each recipe.  Deb's recipes ALWAYS work and her explanation and approach to the building the dish is clear and simple to follow.  So far, I have cooked 3 recipes from the cook book and they are delicious.  I see myself using this cook book most weeks for evening meals and baked treats.  Loving this book.
B0073Q0IY2|4.0|I loved the Thing, and have seen all versions several times.  I hesitated on this one because it sounded like they wanted to just cash in on the name and make more money.  I actually really enjoyed it.  The story is sort-of linked to the main film, but you can watch it alone and enjoy it just as much.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Campy. Quirky and fun.  A really great rental.  I do not know why it did not get more attention.  Kids. Were goof actors.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|A lot of the movie does not make sense.  If you are looking for a good plot this is not the movie for you.  But there is plenty of action from a lot of great ageing action stars.  Lots of 1 liners and some light hearted jabs.  It was still worth watching once.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Great show and actors.  Will enjoy another viewing now and as broadcast entertainment continues on its downward migration, future viewings as well...
B007B8H97Q|5.0|It's compelling and riviting, and heart-warming for the most part.  I just couldn't get enough of the consummate acting, especially that of Dame Maggie Smith and our own American Liz Montgomery.  The writing, direction, set design and costuming are superb.  I am looking forward to the third season with great anticipation.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|This movie was wooden and slow, a sleeper of a bad movie. I had seen the other two movies in the trilogy and was eager to see the last one, to see how it caped the series. It had the normal amount of fantastic (but predictable) CGI but the somnolent actors plodded through their scenes in mechanical precision, picking up a paycheck for their efforts but not giving much in return. If you REALLY need to see this movie, borrow the disc from a friend but DON'T spend your hard earned money on it.
1400031524|5.0|This story is much more interesting to read than to watch.  I liked the story even though it is convulated.  Worth the time.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|A truly thought provoking story about man and his (her) relationship to the concept of time.  This should be a required read for courses on philosophy and religious studies.
B000OIZUW6|5.0|I love this book. Ken Follett has become one of my favorite writers. Many books don't leave a lasting impression,but Ken Follett's books always are memorable .

B009WO7NQO|5.0|the graphics are great the levels are fun sure they can be hard but that's okay. I am a huge fan of star wars and angry birds so this is great for anyone who is a star wars and angry birds fan.
B00A77II0U|5.0|excellent game. definitely work paying for. hidden object plus makes you think of how to use objects to get you through the game. highly recommended!
B005HSL626|4.0|I like this one because I enjoy playing it; but mot importantly all three of my children ages 6-13 enjoy it also! I would recommend this product to others :)
B004DM1ZQY|4.0|This game HAD to have been programmed by someone who has never played backgammon. Opening rolls are about the only thing that follows what you might expect.  There are times it will hit every possible blot, and then other times, will not hit a blot that would be to it's advantage. The end game is ridiculous. The program wants to want to move all men to the home point FIRST - even if there are men that could be taken off a higher point. Unless I play with the doubling cube, I can easily beat the program 98% of the time at the top level. Graphics are very good, the game keeps better statistics statistics, the available moves are highlighted, and even the sound of the men 'shooshing' as they are moved are all pluses.<br />In comparison to the Compulab game on my Kindle keyboard, no contest!<br />But I wanted Backgammon for the Fire HD.....................<br /><br />Three months later.<br />I am much more satisfied with the HD backgammon at this point. There is the feature that allows you to \\"undo\\" a move, because the touch screen can be somewhat sensitive. But you can \\"undo\\" all the way back to the beginning. I'll do that to see if a specific move was where the game fell apart. I still find the end game irritating. The statistics allow you to look at how many spaces could be moved, and the number of doubles in the game. After a total of over 700 games played on all levels, I moved my review up one star to four.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Love it  I really enjoy listening to Rod Stewart and his sexy voice.  My husband also ejoys his albums.  We have all of them
B00A0A6F7C|3.0|I was a little disappointed. not sure what I was expecting, it wasn't this. It seemed she didnt give it her \\"all\\". She sounded better when she sang in front of Simon.
B007HACDLK|4.0|You know what you'll get with Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp novels; a hero who goes about his daily business which happens to be ridding the world of terrorists through cunning and extreme violence of action.  If you like Flynn's other books, you'll enjoy this one.  Same basic framework with just enough new characters and plot twists to keep the series fresh.
0765357151|2.0|I guess I'm an outlier- I was really not impressed with this book. The writing is mediocre, occasionally feeling like the author was abusing a thesaurus and awkwardly working in ten-dollar words. But really, it's the fact that 90% of the story basically goes like this:<br /><br />\\"Robert thought about the vampires but couldn't figure everything out immediately, so he became enraged, drank a bunch of whiskey, and smashed the glass against the wall. The next day he found a book and tried to do some research, but the first sentence did not explain everything, so he became enraged, drank some whiskey, and smashed the glass AND the bottle against the wall. Later he found a microscope but it wasn't calibrated very well so he smashed it against the wall. Then he was so angry that he drank all the whiskey and smashed it against the wall too. He realized he was running out of glasses, which made him angry, so he smashed several more of them against the wall. This whole time, there was some clicking noises in his throat. Also, his throat made a clicking noise. And he was angry. Sometimes he almost thought of something sad, but that made him too angry, and then he had to drink.\\"<br /><br />Finally it starts to get interesting and you think maybe the novel's going to GO somewhere and...boom, it's over. It's over, and the next half of the book are unrelated short stories. They're okay... kinda cute little horror vignettes. But at least on my edition of the book, there is ZERO indication that half of the book is not \\"I Am Legend\\"- no mention on the front, or the back, or the end pages. There's a table of contents but it just looks like they are chapter names. For some reason that really sticks in my craw- feels like false advertising.<br /><br />Now, granted, I'm not big into vampire novels so maybe this is as good as the genre gets (I mean, look how highly Twilight is rated :-P ) But I'm very much not impressed.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This was a great movie, but it could have been a perfect one if they had omitted all the foul words.  I wouldn't allow my children to watch it because of that.  Otherwise, it was another fabulous installment of the series.
B0066W1AZK|3.0|Played it and it turns out to be a pretty good game although I have not won yet, but there is still a chance.
B009G3T01M|5.0|Definitely one of the best albums ive picked up in the last year. the lyrics he puts together and the hooks will make this album enjoyable long into the future
B0019LZV4E|5.0|I'm a sucker for musicals and this one has everything. Great haunting melodies, vengeance, romance, demented barber... Could there be a more entertaining movie?
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This was a great product at a good price.  The quality was perfect and of course the show is amazing!
0316187216|5.0|Joe delivers his usual excellent dialogue and intrigue. Every bit as good as his previous books. Buy this! You will not be disappointed.
0439023491|5.0|I love all 3 of this series.  In book 2 we get shocked as Katniss and Peeta get thrown back in to another Hunger Games.  In a fight for their life, they have to figure out who is on their side and who wants them dead.  Alliances will be made and broken.  This author is amazing, she totally immerses you in the story, every little detail means something.  It's a book you can read again and again, and each time it is just as hard to put down.  I read each book in a day, because it was literally not possible for me to do much else besides read.<br /><br />I know this book is meant for teenagers, but I feel it is better for adults, because it is quite violent.  Characters you come to love get brutally murdered in each book, I feel it should be for mature readers only.<br /><br />I bought it on my Kindle and I fully recommend it.  All three books are very thick, it is much easier to carry around the kindle, than a bunch of books.
1616960922|5.0|Nice quick read with lots of meat in it. Sanderson magically fits so much plot and world building into so short a novel. The characters are thoroughly intriguing and well rounded. Loved it.
0439023513|5.0|Let me start with I love all 3 of this series.  Book 3 is a roller coaster ride of events.  I don't want to spoil it for anybody, but this book is my least favorite of the 3 (although I still love it).  It becomes more political and deals with that aspect of the war they are fighting.  The first 2 books made me cry during several parts and this book did as well.  There are many shocking things that happen that I truly did not like, in fact I was pissed off when it happened.  But in sorting out my feelings when it was all over I realized that is what makes this book feel real.  Everything doesn't always work out for the best or the way you wanted.  Sure, everybody loves a happy ending, but even happy endings are hard work.  Not much comes easy in this world.  Suzanne Collins gets that and wrote her story that way. This author is amazing, she totally immerses you in the story, every little detail means something.  It's a book you can read again and again, and each time it is just as hard to put down.  I read each book in a day, because it was literally not possible for me to do much else besides read.<br /><br />I know this book is meant for teenagers, but I feel it is better for adults, because it is quite violent.  Characters you come to love get brutally murdered in each book, I feel it should be for mature readers only.<br /><br />I bought it on my Kindle and I fully recommend it.  All three books are very thick, it is much easier to carry around the kindle than a bunch of books.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Way of Kings was the first Sanderson book I read and he has made a lasting impression. It starts a little slow, but the ending blew my mind. I cannot recommend this book enough. The magic and the world is beautifully realized and the characters have a depth to them that is so human and real that you won't believe that they are not real. Incredible.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|After a lot of 3D Blu-ray movies I've seen, this one did a great job with depth.  They didn't try to overwhelm you with to much popping out.  Things like distances and heads up displays looked great!  I don't want to give anything else a way, but I am very happy I bought this collection.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|If you are a thing fan this is your prequel.  Get it! And I won't spoil the ending.<br /><br />Its more spookier than the one with Kurt Russel.
B0096HID5M|5.0|Just my cup of tea...a really fun musical with some great dance numbers. I loved the humor and thought the two lead performers and all the big name actors did a great job.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|must watch! must own!<br /><br />I bought this as a gift for my gf. it's under the tree rigt now couldn't wait for Christmas to watch it :) so I used amazon off my ps3 quality was perfect stream was perfect!! price was a little eh for a HD but still...it's batman!!
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have read many of DeMille's novels and thought them well thought out, a good read and plausable.  I found, however, that his latest, &#34;THE PANTHER&#34; was somewhat trite with the main character, Corey, over the top. Hard to imagine that a NYDective, good persons all, would be able to accomplish the daredevil feats of an experienced &#34;Special Forces&#34; person.  Having said that I though the book was worth the read for the history presented of this &#34;Godforsaken&#34; country and its people.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I have waited so long for Rod to do a Christmas album...and this does not disappoint!  Auld Lang Syne is amazing with the bagpipes and solo violin...really very authentic!  As always, his arrangements are so tasteful.  Hearing him sing &#34;When You Wish Upon a Star&#34; makes me think that he should do an entire CD of Disney tunes!!  Why not??  He has young children and I am sure that people of all ages would appreciate it...the tunes are wonderful and he would put his own spin on the arrangements.  This Christmas CD is a treasure...thank you Rod!!!
B003NX76BM|5.0|Very good book! Nora Roberts writing is always a book you can't put down. She still writes very good books.
B004EYSXT8|5.0|Loved this book. Have always believed that there is no substitute to becoming a talented sportsperson. This book certainly showed, by example, that you need to focus, be prepared to make sacrifices to achieve your aims.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie in order to better understand some of what I saw. While it does not jump around as much as the film, I found the reading pretty tough going.
B00845MRKE|5.0|I've been well guided by my predecessor reviewers, to whom I owe a debt for helping with a big decision - has anyone else noticed how HARD it is to obtain money these days AND how ungodly expensive things have become!? I mean $5 lb for BACON???? - and to whom I also direct a well earned, \\"KUDOS!\\".  Your reviews were knowledgeable & heartfelt, as befits this work. A film that's SO MUCH MORE than \\"just\\" a film!  The philosophical, ecological, ethical, theological and political questions raised by BR make it one of my personal TOP 10 FILMS OF ALL TIME; which is as close as my mercurial personality allows me to come in naming any work BEST above all others.  Both as an artist (I'm a musician) and a fan, BR hits ALL the right buttons, what's more, in those spots where I'm left wanting; desperate for answers I'm not given, I realize this is by design.  In a conspiracy between writers Philip K. Dick, Fancher, et al & Director Ridley Scott and his actors, I'm forced to LEARN TO FISH; because they're not handing out any fish dinners.  This comment though, leads me to pinpoint the single flaw I note in the reviews that have gone before.  To wit, no credit given to the IMPRESSIVE work done by secondary cast members; the \\"below the title\\" players who make movies possible.  I'd therefore like to call to your attention 3 PERFORMANCES - though, there were very few, if any, less-than-stellar performances ...<br />Edward James Olmos / Gaff; an actor who later made hay with another SciFi character, Adm Wm Adama, Olmos brought just the proper amounts of gravitas and street trash to his bright-eyed 'bad' good guy role;<br />William Sanderson / J.F. Sebastian; with credits literally too numerous to mention, an undergrad degree & Juris Doctorate, Sanderson is as much a thinking man as he is a thinking man's actor!<br />Lastly, a performance almost universally overlooked & (IMHO) under-appreciated, that of 'pleasure girl', Pris:<br />Darryl Hannah; setting herself up to be invited insidewith more panache than most centenarian vampires, young Pris gives the impression she's in her element, as much when she schmoozes Sebastian as when she tries to 'off' Deckard.  Again IMHO, this is a phenomenally nuanced performance and what's really incredible about it, is that it doesn't seem incredible - because the bar for acting is set SO HIGH, then continuously bested by this cast.  WHAT A FILM!
B009CPIR9K|3.0|A wonderful premise. I had waited literally for years to finally see this, but was somewhat disappointed at the script.
1400052181|5.0|Consider: the cell culture of a woman who died in absolute agony, treated in the \\"for colored only\\" section of the hospital, leads to not only saving an untold number of lives, but billions of dollars of revenue.  A culture taken without permission, from a donor who remained anonymous for decades.  Now, consider the fact that her extended family still cannot afford decent health care today.<br /><br />One of the great accomplishments of the author was not just a clear, concise writing style -- especially necessary when writing about medical discoveries -- but getting the Lacks family, so exploited by white people, to even meet with her, let alone share their feelings, with a white author.<br /><br />This is, as I'm sure others have noted, nonfiction that reads like fiction.  It is told in the first person because the author's own experiences are so vital to the story.  She met not only with family but some of the scientists responsible for the discovery of the immortal HeLa cell, and includes their feelings about what they did, and whether the would do it the same way again.<br /><br />In face, to this day it is unclear whether biological waste, bound for the garbage, remains in the possession of the donor, and how important informed consent is and whether it can include discoveries that may be years in the future.  While this story doesn't answer that question, it poses it with great passion.<br /><br />I was going to include one very minor complaint -- that the cast of characters can be confusing, given that it includes generations of  the Lacks; Helen's husbands and children, her siblings, their grandchildren, as well as first and second cousins, some of whom intermarried --and a listing of same is absent.  I had to consult the index several times to keep them all straight.  Then, purely by accident, I found such a guide is in the BACK of the text.  So now my minor complaint, as well as my heads up to anyone buying the book, is that for crucial information you will probably need the character list more than once, and that it's in the back of the book, and not in front,where it belongs.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|&#34;Team of Rivals&#34;  had much new information. and good comparisons of all the players. It is highly recommended as a companion to the new Lincoln movie.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|After the first 10 pages I was a little worried for &#34;The Martian&#34; - nice clean prose but a lot of description of numerical calculating being done by the main character. I stuck with it, though, and was rewarded with an enjoyable thriller that tickled the engineer in me. No spoilers, but if you have a science/engineering bent I bet you will find yourself rooting for The Martian more than you have for any other tech-SF character in print in the last decade.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This is a very enjoyable, easy read, especially after seeing the movie. The book allows a much better understanding of the zookeepers duty and philosophy.
B001IYCMNA|5.0|More involved to set up than your run-of-the-mill consumer-grade WAP, but great signal and range, and have yet to crash the device address table. Can set up 4 separate SSIDs on a single device, and it speaks a as well as b/g/n. Money well spent.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Magical and wondrous. Neil Gaiman spins a remarkable tale. I had seen this in the theater and right after watching it on Amazon, I bought the book. There are major differences between the two, however, they both stand on there own as great stories.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|This was one of the most sophomoric attempts at writing I have ever seen.I can not believe that this authors attempt at humor would be considered funny,cleaver or AT ALL ENTERTAINING,To insert an occasional witty line  is one thing but to beat the reader to death with one stupid attempt at humor after another was repulsive.I found this book to be a total waste of money.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Love it so addicting ready for the next one. I could read this book over and over it is so good happy reading
B0041OT9W6|5.0|The moment i read Anne Frank's diary,i was blown by how a young girl can describe so much in eloquence.This book is truly amazing and though Anne passed on,her diary will forever remain a constant reminder of her life , ww2 and its my hope that it touches the lives of other people.May her legacy leave on!
B004UOCF3W|5.0|Awesome album, quickly became one of my all time favorites.<br />I would definitely recommend anyone who likes alternative music to purchase it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book.  My only disappointment is that only two of the three books were available to read.  I don't want to wait till May to read the end of the story.
B008I43DYU|5.0|My eyes are not what they used to be and this calculator is so nice on my kindle HD. This is a good app to have .
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|The best thing of this game is based on the real cold war history background. All jets are real, with real air force markings based on real facts -<br />First, It was not a 'fancy ', later I can not stop - Two thumbs up. I love to play Mig-17, Mig-19.
0143121006|3.0|I often wish that I half-star ratings were available; if they were, I'd give this 3-1/2 stars.  The author does a great job of conveying the atmosphere of Peking at the onset of World War II, including but not limited to the weather, the \\"last fling\\" behavior of the foreign community, the eccentricities of the people involved, and so on.  And the mystery surrounding the brutal murder of Pamela Werner is extremely absorbing.  However, the book ultimately disappoints in a number of ways.  First, even though it purports to be a work of non-fiction, there is no index or other features that would normally accompany a non-fiction book.  Second, the latter part of the book consists of the author's reconstruction of the murder, including its perpetrators, comes across as a cut-and-paste add-on instead of being an integral part of the book.
B00A77II0U|5.0|enjoyed game like to solve other puzzles to get the big puzzle ..................will deft try more of these games in the future
0062127241|2.0|I love Townsend's music.  As such, I couldn't wait to read it.  Then I couldn't wait to finish.  Very little insight into his music.  There are moments of real inner reflection about himself, taking you close the the climax of insight, then he abruptly stops and moves on to the next material purchase.  Very sad how callous he is toward his wife and kids.  Book is very disjointed throughout where it looks like he is giving details then drops a fact in the makes you realize he left so much out.  Example:  he goes into detail of a stint of boozing and cocaine use leading you toward an expected rock bottom, then out of the blue mentions needing help to kick prescription drugs and heroin.  He never mentioned the latter use before.  Confusing.  You learn more about his finances and poor management of them than anything else.  Not worth the money, but Who fans will have to slog through it anyway.  Guess he needed the money.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love this game its challenging and takes skill. best best best best game ever created ever in history of history
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|the app itself is fun and addicting...I have it on my fire.. but since AlI got it I have had glitches on my kindle and am not happy.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Enjoyed this little game until the last update.  Now it just crashes on my Kindle Fire after the Learning Company splash screen...  Feels like we are all beta testing this game.  Would give it a solid 4 if it was not so buggy...
B006LMMN8I|5.0|Buttery voice, wonderful phrasing, great lyrics and musical accompaniment. Wow. NPR includes Gregory Porter as one of the top 100 favorite new songs of 2012. I'd put it very close to the top--perhaps at the top. Buy this album. Support this singer.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I was a little iffy about getting the i5-3570k vs the i7-3770k because I really wanted the 3770k and it being over a $100 dollar upgrade and my wallet already stretched I went with it.  I am very happy with the processor, it does an amazing job.  I do a lot of online gaming and video/photo editing and this thing just churns it out. Very easy to overclock and runs great.  I cool it with the Antec 620 H2O water cooler.<br />No complaints here, will always recommend Intel products and this is no exception.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|After finding out Jace was Clarrys brother I didn't want to read the next book, but the first one was such a good read I had to go on. Without telling you to much to spoil the book for yourself I will tell you that Jace and Clarry fight their relationship an at times it makes you feel awkward reading it but others you just want them to realize that Valentine is a liar so why should they believe him about that. Simon and Clarry become an item but only for a little while because Simon knows he can't compete with Jace. Alec finds his strength a little bit and Simon finds out what's on the other side to the downworlders. This book will test the characters love and loyalty to each other. This has been a must read for me. Can't wait to finish the next one.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Another great &#34;buffet&#34; of readings by Mr. Ferris!  I lost 30 lbs. in 3 months using his &#34;The 4 Hour Body&#34; book and looked forward to  checking out his new mega-learning book.  It does not disappoint.  So many good ideas and an enjoyable read.  I know I can pick up the book any time and just open it to any page and know I will find something useful and interesting.  Not just a cookbook.  Love it!  Thanks Tim!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|samurai vs zombie defense is awesome I hate how I cant get my glue credits but beside that it is an awesome game
B008PE9GSA|5.0|It amazes me that after all of these years ZZTop still gets me up and dancing.  I don't think this band has ever put out a bad song.  This album continues their legacy.
B005VT42BS|5.0|Worked with out any flaws right out of the box!  I am pleased with the product and I am sure I will be using this for a long time.
141659521X|5.0|Another Mitch Rapp novel full of action and ruthless negotiations with a enemy that deserves it. Lets just hope that we really have operatives like Rapp that haven't been &#34;P-Whipped&#34; by our administration.
B00632HWOG|5.0|i liked this app, i was able to check my mail only after installing this. yahoo is so silly! once loaded it was able to accept my email in the actual email portion of android
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a great book, really enjoyed it, very easy reading. I'm halfway into my second week of training for cutting and have lost 2.2 lbs of fat. Bought The Shredded Chef too and my girlfriend is now reading Thinner Leaner Stronger and enjoying it as well. Mike(the author)is a great guy and actually answers any questions one may have very quickly!!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|LOVE IT!!! every device i get, this is the first to be loaded. It's fun and silly. great way to really make you think! so many options available such as shaking and removing dupes. a must have!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Product was received a promised.  I find ordering from Amazon to be very convenient and all products are usually price competitive.
B0071XO8RA|1.0|I'm glad I purchased 1-5. As it was it felt like I received a chapter, a long chapter, from a book. I'm I glad I got it for free, since I can't imagine paying for one chapter at a time. Wait till all the &#34;chapters&#34; are written before purchasing.
B005R4PGQM|5.0|I've owned this CD for quite a while now, since it was first released. I listen to it on a daily basis. It is a beautiful cd! Darren's voice is flawless, like always. The song \\"Stupid Mistake\\" has to be my favorite. It's something about the beat, the drums, I love it. \\"Bloodstained Heart\\" is also one of my favorites. It's a beautiful love song. It's about love being there even in the worst of times. Even if you're losing the battle, your love will be there fighting till the end. Black Out the Sun is also a great song, the music/ instruments are beautiful in it. This Album is so great.. I'm sure I will end up buying multiples of this album (like I have with Darren's other albums). If you're a Darren fan then you have to buy this album. It's my favorite so far :-)
0547884591|5.0|The Four Hour Chef is a fantastic \\"cookbook\\" (even though it's much more than that) If you want to make amazing meals that make you look awesome (with minimal effort) this is the book for you.<br /><br />Oh yeah, this book will also teach you how to learn ANY skill, and become world class at that skill.<br /><br />Why are you still reading reviews? Click \\"add to cart\\" now and become more awesome.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I got this app just wanting to be able to listen to some good music without using Pandora. I started downloading music I like and after I played one song just as music, not video, the videos stopped working. DO NOT GET THIS APP. IT IS NOT GOOD AND EXPLAINS WHY IT'S FREE.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Amazing game, the only problem is that in the latest update 0.5.0 the nether IS a complete ripoff. But thank you for adding this to the kindle fire. :)
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Kids love this movie and want to watch it everyday !  It wouldn't be Christmas without it !  Great movie !
B00007BKVC|4.0|As there are many different ways to interpret music, abstract art, Shakespeare or any art for that matter; so are different approaches to interpret this movie. &#34;Thelma & Louise&#34; transcend beyond the simplified interpretation as &#34;Bad Girls&#34; chick flick comedy, or a counterpoint to the male version of Road Movies. It could also be construed as a protest movie, a cry against the exacerbating violence in society. As soon as law and social morals are abandoned it may lead to a society in chaos.  When I first saw &#34;Thelma & Louise&#34;, I was shocked and perturbed by its ending; I kept asking myself what led to this tragic ending and if T & L had other choices than suicide. Following the events which led to this tragic situation, two casual women friends set up for a two days economical relaxation trip. During the journey they were sexually harassed, their money was stolen, situation started to exacerbate and out of control; they committed murder in self defence, armed robbery in order to survive, add to it disbelief in the juridical system to enforce justice. This chain of events eventually led to their self-destruction that was initially triggered by the violence in society. This idea is also beautifully conveyed by the ominous musical background played by the wailing and lamenting electric guitar.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|I was weary on purchasing this game especially sine the price was around twenty dollars but I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and over all graphics of the time worthy game.
1450441319|5.0|Really love this book...so complete about what each exercise does and the part of the muscle it works.  Definitely recommended!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Enjoyed each show, they held my attention.  Complex plots kept my interest.  No four-letter words, no violence, a well-acted family television drama series. Another good choice from British television.  I saw these on PBS, and will watch each show again more than once even.  England sends us fine films like this, another good choice from Britian is Bramwell.  A father-daughter physician team, I was riveted to my chair as I watched the entire series.  Bramwell is the type of series that you watch slowly not wants to rush through it and have it end.I seek out quality dramas such as these two.  I recommend this as a gift. Bramwell not suited to young children.  But to older teens and adults it's wonderful.  I give both of these series' five-stars.
B008MC175A|5.0|If you're a fan of X-Men this is a definite must in your collection.  A must buy, especially when it's on sale.
1401322786|3.0|I haven't finished the book yet...but I think that it is very thoughtfully written...so that about anyone can understand the scientific language /lingo  etc. I recommend it as a &#34;starter&#34; book for this subject....quantum physics,<br />relativity, the boson etc.  I look forward to finishing it.
B007XC9BSK|5.0|the product is very nice, I liked and arrived in perfect condition. I recommend the product. I liked very much!
B007L3BMGA|3.0|&#34;Fifty shades of Gray&#34;, it was just erotic rubbish I will not be buying any of the rest of the series
B000GCFG7E|5.0|You can never figure out  the ending, always a another twist or two. I have read 10 of the Reacher series, my wife is 2 books ahead of me. She loves them..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love it, im addicted!!! keeps my mind strong, best game ive played in a long time<br /> try it you will love it too
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Can't wait to start book 2! Was hooked right away, now I'm going to watch the first season .Enough said
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I liked the story line and the interaction between Nikki and Rook. The story had a lot of twists and turns which really kept you guessing who had commited the murder.
1439153663|5.0|This is one of te best novels I have ever read.I was moved by the characters and their loyalty to each other.I am from the South and can relate to the descriptions Mrs. Grissom gives.They are so detailed you can see in your mind's eye and almost smell the smoke and food she makes you invision.<br />I am sorry to say, that my family,(many years before my time) had slaves work their strawberry farms.The family became wealthy but the money, it did not last.The wealth made it through many generations, until like all things tha come from ill means,it depleated.My Great Grandmother had the \\"little house\\"still out back of the \\"big house\\" even in my generation, even though no one lived in it,I knew what it was for.<br />The thing that I did experience in my generation is the fact that the lady that worked in my Grandmother's house for years,Granny Ree,was the only person my Grandmother trusted to stay with her as her health failed.I loved Granny Ree as we all did and when my Grandmother died I found Granny Ree in the parking lot of the funeral home and could not understand why she was reluctant to go in to be with our family.I grabbed her hand and took her in with me because she was part of my family and she deserved to be there more than any of the rest of us.My Mother had to explain to me as to why Granny Ree was reluctant I didn't understand that there were still boundries that were unseen and unspoken.I guess the fact that I never looked at Granny Ree being any different than the rest of us, except her skin was much darker, means that maybe my generation and the ones after me will only have to read about such things as this in history or a novel and never experience the true since of relatability to such things.We can all love and live without limitations to order and color.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This looks like a generic romance novel. The plot sounds average, if not boring. But this book is better than its summary, title, and cover let on. The characters have such realistic emotional flaws. They are fairly realistic (for a romance novel). It's a quick read, but I've been thinking about the issues raised in this book since I read it three days ago.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have four boys from ages 3-11 and they all love this game.  My 3 year old really loves playing this game. He does pretty good for his age.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've only just started the trilogy and I can't wait to finish it.  I can't believe I waited so long to download it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My kids and I like playing this game.  Lots of different choices and levels of skill.  My kids really enjoy playing it.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|A good Price , and a good Cover . It is very useful and good protection for the Kindle fire.
B009LRE040|1.0|I'm not a troll and I'm not an editor, I'm just a disappointed fan.  I adore Nolan's work, Inception is one of my top 10 movies and I've watched The Dark Knight multiple times.  But, The Dark Knight Rises was too long and just plain boring (I had to pause halfway through to convince myself to finish)  The plot was tiresome, of course there's a scheme to kill everyone, of course Batman is going to save the day.  I was just hoping for something a little more entertaining.  It is what is it, a rental.  Unless you're a hardcore fan, pass.  I seriously feel terrible for such a rubbish review but I finished this movie feeling unengaged and uninterested.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|The more dots you have to connect, the more fun it is! For something that starts out simple, it can get complicated quickly. Surprisingly addicting!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|A wonderful film with entertaining characters and the stakes are high and feel realistic.  A lot of fun and some great turns.  Highly recommended.
B007KW55VK|5.0|Second album from Rumer confirms one thing. SHE HAS A STUNNING VOICE. It's like a velvet. I didn't hear any of the songs before, so I am unable to compare them to the originals. However, in my opinion it is one of the best cdies that was released in 2012.<br />Strongly recommended!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I don't read a lot of military themed literature but this book was recommended by a friend and I am glad I read it. I learned a lot and it is fantastically written. A big thank you to our men and women in uniform.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids enjoy this game very much! Every now and then, they used to play it! Try it yourself! Sure you will enjoy too!
