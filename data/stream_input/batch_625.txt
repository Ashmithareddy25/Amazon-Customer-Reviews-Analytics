B000FQ4M58|5.0|Here it is, the long-awaited finale to the \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" series. And this one is *dark*. It's depressing. It's melancholy. It's angry. Meat Loaf has crafted a real downer here. Don't get me wrong, this is a great album. Meat's voice has never sounded better, and the songwriting by Steinman and others is top-notch. But BOY, I didn't expect this. The songs practically drip with loss and regret. The future is seen as bleak, the past as a tormenting enemy. This is how the saga ends...in despair and blackness.    But wait! Counterbalancing the hopelessness of tracks like \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\" is the angry defiance of \\"Alive\\" and \\"Seize the Night\\". Meat's not going down easy.    Yet the disc ends with the barren but beautiful \\"Cry to Heaven\\". It's all over, the monster is not only loose but victorious. The guy on the bike on the album cover loses, the angel is doomed, turn out the lights, so long.    But what a listen! Five stars and a classic in the making.

0060872675|4.0|As anyone interested in Discworld's Watchmen series knows, young Sam's favorite picture book is a much-chewed and loved tome with the title Where's My Cow? This delightful book allows everyone to share in Sam's glee, especially since the second half is the Vimes/Ankh-Morpork version, highlighting familiar characters and their trademark catchphrases. This is not a book for someone venturing into Discworld, including the traditional audience for picture books; the jokes are best appreciated by seasoned veterans. Definitely a perfect gift for the Ankh-Morpork fantatic!

0790731479|5.0|When the world didn't know who Tim Burton was, it must have been quite a shock to realise his genius first. This larger than life, colorful, yet dark, very funny, bizarre tale broke into the cinemas, and changed the face of storytelling as we knew it forever. Tim Burton was born, and a whole new dimension of dreams, imagination broke free. Movie was never the same again. And thank Tim Burton for that! You cannot do anything but enjoy this crazy story about a ghost, about the importance of life and love, friendship, and all this covered in an unbelievable cloak.

Yet with that said, if we still feel that we are not completely aware of are true Identity these cards can awaken us by allowing the words to penetrate beyond the thoughts that keep us trapped in fear. They will do their job if we will allow them to, and even that is not quite right. Consciousness will transform us when we surrender to what is, no matter what the situation, condition or life challenge we may face. When we no longer resist what is we are free. Use everything, including these meditation cards to bring you to pure awareness.
B000EULJLU|5.0|You might have to be a serious TOOL fan to really appreciate this cd as it is not the typical stuff they put out.  There are two long songs dedicated to Maynard's mother who passed away in '03 that refer to her very religious beliefs and his frustration with it.  He sings the lyrics softly and there are only a few intense guitar rifs that get your head banging.  But the content of the lyrics are very meaningful and that is something that I've always loved about TOOL.  The rest of the songs are more their usual style.  Yah!  In my opinion the entire cd is INCREDIBLE.  They only get better with age.  They continue to grow as humans and reflect that in their music.  If you follow Maynard at all and are aware of his struggle with his Mom's religious beliefs the two songs dedicated to his Mom may really hit you.  I couldn't listen to \\"10,000 days\\" (the song) without bawling for the first couple of months I listened to it.  And I listened to it over and over...   As usual, the lyrics will get you thinking and the music will get you moving.  Gotta love TOOL!!!!

B0002XNSY0|5.0|The background realism in this movie perfectly balances many wonderfully comedic and absurd happenings in the foreground.  Peter Seller's comedic genius really shines through.

B000FQ4M58|4.0|This is the first of the 'Bat' albums not to contain exclusively Jim Steinman songs. There are a total of 14 tracks clocking in at just under one hour and twenty minutes, so there is a lot of music there to digest and of the 14 songs, 7 are Steinman compositions (though some of them are older Steinman songs). The bulk of the remaining music is written by Desmond Child. In many ways its a typical 'Bat' album with the over the top grandiose treatment given to every song and a more emotionally heavy feel then Meat Loaf's other recordings. There are some pretty impressive guests on the album, Brian May lends his signature guitar sound to Steinman's older song, \\"Bad For Good\\" and Steve Vai shows up to power \\"In The Land Of The Pig, The Butcher Is King\\". As with the previous albums, Todd Rundgren shows up to lend his talents at arranging the background vocal 'choirs' that are as much a part of these records as Meat Loaf himself. <br /> <br />Of course the bottom line is \\"Is the record any good?\\" That depends on what you like and if you feel that if its not all Steinman, then its not a true 'Bat' record. The Steinman tunes are easily recognizable from the other songs. Not that they are any better or worse, but Steinman songs are pretty easy to pick out by their very sound and structure. There are some very good non-Steinman songs in my opinion on the album. \\"Blind As A Bat\\" is a non Steinman song about unconditional love that isnt bad at all and I personally like \\"Monstro / Alive\\". In the middle of all of the heavy music on this recording, this is a real change of pace musically and I like it a lot. Probably the center piece of the recording is the 9:46 long Steinman penned \\"Seize The Night\\". It's this album's most intricate work complete with choirs, orchestra and flat out rock and roll. This is THE signature Jim Steinman piece on this album. <br /> <br />What works on this record? The songs written by Desmond Child dont sound out of place with the Steinman works. He understands what a Bat album is supposed to sound like and comes through with some good material. Meat Loaf of course puts more into every song that he tackles then anyone else singing today. He is one performer that never short changes a line of anything that he sings. The length of the album works for it because it comes across as a complete work rather then a collection of songs just thrown together for a record. <br /> <br />What doesnt work? There are three songs that are billed as 'duets' with female singers, yet only one is with Patti Russo who has been the female on Meat's albums dating back to Bat Out Of Hell II. Her voice is the perfect foil for Meat Loaf's in timbre and strength. The other two that sing here dont sound right with Meat's voice to my ears. The weakest song on the album? Believe it or not its a Steinman penned number. \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\". While lyrically its a great song, it seems just a hair too slow here and strangely 'empty' emotionally. It seems that a conscious effort was made not to duplicate the earlier Celine Dion version of the song. There is no echoing choir as in the earlier version. Thats a hallmark of a Jim Steinman work like this and its stripped away here. As terrible as this sounds, I almost prefer the Celine version to the version of the song that shows up here. <br /> <br />Overall I like it. It's closer in tone to the second Bat album and its one of those recordings that each time you listen to it, you pick up something new because its so dense lyrically and musically. I'm on my 3rd listen through and aside from my gripe with 'Coming Back to Me Now', I dont see myself skipping past any songs for a while to come at least and for me at least, thats a sign of an enjoyable record no matter who is the artist.
B0000C2IQD|5.0|This is a great kid's movie with a lot of characters and a great story plot. It's a good combination of a musical and a story with good characters and characters that do not make good choices :-) I would suggest not over thinking the story line, it's a kid's movie after all. And no its not all about the flying cars, believe me even a two year old is capable of appreciating more!!
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I rarely take the time to write reviews, as I realize that music sometimes can be a highly personal experience. However, I felt compelled to offer my opinion of Meatloaf's Bat Out of Hell III. I am listening to the album at this moment, and am truly enthralled by its sound and production. I didn't know what to expect from Meatloaf at this stage in his career, but I'm pleased to announce that he never sounded better than on most of the offerings on this EPIC masterpiece. Usually it takes time for a recording to resonate so deeply with a listner, but this music is intoxicating, beautiful at times, and just somehow winds its way into your heart with each listen. The passion in this artist's voice moves me, and I reflect on the effort and energy that went into this work. He and others obviously toiled many hours to seemlessly blend these songs into a work that perhaps rivals the previous two BAT albums. Yes, you read me correctly...this album rocks from start to finish, each track draws forth emotion and passion. I listened to the other two BAT albums again to remind myself of the magic that both of them unleash, yet somehow BAT III takes the sound to another level. It's louder, modern and just amazingingly produced. Great music like this doesn't come along often. One suggestion: listen to this music loud; it needs to be heard at the level in which these artists intended it to be heard. I will enjoy listening to this album for many years to come.
0060786523|3.0|I liked the book but I still have not heard the end of selecting a 1458 page book for our monthly book group. The consensus of those who did attend the review was that much of the detail could have been deleted in favor of a more condensed version.

B000F1IQN2|3.0|This movie actually more deeply touched my sensitivity nerve than the original movie, \\"Sword of Gideon\\", however, I don't think it was as good of a movie.  This is a stand alone telling of events that followed the massacre of the Isreali athletes during the Munich Games.  Yet, there was no depth to the story of the aftermath of this action that Isreal took to avenge the murders.  There was no background established or created about those that were killed in retaliation for planning the attack, nor those that actually carried out the attack.  I gained no depth of character about the operatives (other than Eric Bana's character) nor do the film makers attempt to have you learn about them. <br />This story, though thought provoking, could have, no should have, been better, deeper, and educated the viewers more about this historical event.

B000GFLE1S|4.0|Charlie Price thought he was free of the family business, moving to London with his gorgeous girlfriend and a life that didn't include the manufacture of shoes.  But fate had other plans for Charlie when his father dies and he finds himself in an office overlooking the factory floor, accessible only through a rickety trap door.  It goes from bad to worse when Charlie discovers that the business has been failing for some time and his father was simply covering that up.<br /><br />He swallows hard and begins to inform members of the staff that they have become redundant (that's the polite British way of saying \\"you're canned, laid off, surplused!\\").  Most take the news with sullen acceptance, however one young lady challenges him with the admonition to \\"just do something different!\\"  Easier said than done, but it's a line that languishes in Charlie's brain as he struggles to sell Price's line of high quality men's shoes against cheaper imports.<br /><br />An encounter with Lola (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) nurtures an idea.  Lola (or Simon as the case may be) it seems is constantly beset with poor quality footwear that is incapable of supporting his/her body mass atop a sexy stiletto heel without breaking.  Arriving back at the factory, Charlie has an idea and returns to London to recruit Lola/Simon as the designer for a line of shoes to be sold to drag queens.  The change in direction is met with bemused skepticism by most of the factory force, while outright hostility from some of the more traditional males is directed at Lola.<br /><br />The whole effort hinges on the success of the new line at the Milan Footwear Shoe, and the road to that debut is littered with events both comedic and poignant.<br /><br />Ejiofor gives depth to his portrayal of the gender-conflicted Lola/Simon and the rest of the cast (with not a single other face or name I recognized) is marvelous.  Kinky Boots is all about understanding, tolerance and the challenge of the global economy.  Supposedly it's based on a true story, but that really has little to do with the reasons for getting this movie.  It's a wonderful film to watch.Supposedly it's based on a true story, but that really has little to do with the reasons for getting this movie.  It's a wonderful film to watch. <br />
B00003CXMG|5.0|I had never heard of this movie before reading the reviews on Amazon.  My husband and I really enjoyed it. It was very entertaining.
0553275976|5.0|It's always fun to read a best seller from almost 20 years ago, especially one that was proclaimed as something of a classic at the time.  It's even more enjoyable to discover that Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities proves worthy of its acclaim even with the absence of cell phones, email and instant messaging.<br /><br />I mention the technology only because such communications dinosaurs as pay phones play significant roles in the story of how an auto accident involving a bond trader and a pedestrian teenager gets complicated by his mistress, a political hack of a DA, the resentful prosecutor, a drunken opportunist of a reporter, society matrons (including the bond trader's wife), a media manipulating black activist/minister, egotistical Wall Street executives, courthouse lawyers and a wealth of other characters.<br /><br />The title says it all.  No character in the book operates without his or her ego getting in the way of things and like a small fire that gets too close to the charcoal lighter and then the gas tank... well, you get the idea.<br /><br />Forget the nonsensical movie they made of this, as far as I'm concerned that film exists solely for the purpose of demonstrating that Tom Hanks can make a bad decisions once every decade or so.  This novel is a delight, one that should be rediscovered by a generation of readers that was in elementary school back in the 80's.
0790731894|5.0|This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat from begining to end. A fast paced drama, that starts with action that takes your breath away and barely gives you a chance to take a normal breath through the end. <br /> <br />A small elite force attempts a mid-air recapture of a highjacked plane, while the President must decide when/if their mission has failed, and order the combat planes accompanying to commercial liner to move in to destroy it before the terrorists can use it as a bomb. Pre-dates 9-11. <br /> <br />I currently rank this movie 5 on my all time favorites list, and the number one drama.

B00005RRG9|3.0|I know that I'm going against the grain here after having read all of the 5 star reviews, but I just recently re-watched the original from the beginning after many, many years.    What is amazing to me is how many vices are present in this movie.    We always seem to refer to the 50's and 60's as the innocent years, but I was surprised to see the 'smoking' grandfather, the 'drinking' minister and the amount of yelling and screaming that went on between Mitch and Maggie.   What I found the most disturbing was the  face slap by Vickie at the end of the movie.    You really don't see any of these things in the newer version and for my childen's sake, I'm glad.  I have always liked both Hayley Mills and Maureen O'Hara and they are really terrific in this movie.    Brian Keith is his usual self - I've never been very impressed with his acting abilities.  Overall, I'm a much bigger Dennis Quaid fan and thought he played the part of the father very well - a much more touching version. <br /> <br />One thing that I did discover, which I thought was very clever on Disney's part was casting Joanna Barnes, who plays Vicky in the original, as Vicky Blake, Meredith's mother in the remake.   Her use of the word 'pet' in both movies is what made me think it might be the same actress and sure enough, it is!  Maybe everyone else realized this, but I did not.   Bravo Disney.   <br /> <br />I still think this is a classic Disney movie, but after having seen both of them recently again, my vote is for the newer version.
B00000K3CR|5.0|What could be better than going forward and seeing what you would look like as you get older? I love this movie, it was so much fun! Tom Hanks is such a wonderful actor, I really like his movies!! This is a movie I have watched a few times and loved it every time. Enjoy!!
B00005JPAM|5.0|While most civilians may grumble at the antics of their problematic kin, at least those personal dramas don't play out under an excruciating media microscope.  Anyone who has become a public figure--whether by choice or happenstance--isn't so lucky.  The Queen explores the tensions between public and private lives, with the clash between traditional decorum and popular celebrity culture forming much of the drama at the story's core. <br /> <br />The film opens with Tony Blair (Michael Sheen), newly-elected prime minister of the UK, having his first awkward audience with Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren).  She reminds him that he's her tenth Prime Minister--the first was Churchill--establishing the tenor of their uneasy relationship.  Her message couldn't be more clear: prime ministers may come and go, but the monarchy is forever. <br /> <br />Fast-forward a few months to September, 1997.  Diana, the Princess of Wales, has just been killed in a Paris car crash, prompting an outpouring of grief among the nation's people.  Elizabeth and the other royals, ensconced at Balmoral, immediately close ranks.  Diana was no longer a member of their family, they maintain, and therefore her funeral should be a private matter, arranged by the Spencer clan.  Blair, meanwhile, has to deal with both the public's grief and their outrage at the royals' stony silence, while simultaneously trying to press Elizabeth into some kind of public gesture. <br /> <br />The script by Peter Morgan, directed by Stephen Frears, deftly weaves the fictional narrative in with news footage from the week between Diana's death and her funeral.  The choices of archival material are outstanding, incorporated so perfectly into the script that the line between fiction and history blurs.  Morgan doesn't try to pretend that Diana was some kind of saint--it's pointed out that the woman the royal family knew and the \\"people's princess\\" were very different women--but neither does he vilify her memory, and the public's grief at Diana's death comes across palpably.  It's almost impossible not to be moved by the crowds of mourners and the vast sea of flowers piled up at the gates of Buckingham Palace. <br /> <br />The engine that propels the narrative is the conflict between Elizabeth and Blair, with all their aides and servants circling around.  They couldn't be more different: she's elderly, austere, and regal; he's young, informal, and almost puppy-like in his exuberance.  Mirren and Sheen play off each other beautifully, and the constant friction between the two characters is a source of both humor and drama.  Their opposing viewpoints are presented pretty fairly: Elizabeth wants to keep things quiet and dignified, while the more modern Blair realizes that Diana's vast popularity has created extraordinary circumstances that traditional \\"arrangements\\" can't really cope with. <br /> <br />The supporting players add much to the production.  Particularly good is Helen McCrory as Cherie Blair, her husband's compliment in every way--warm and funny, modern, sexy, and emotionally accessible.  The staff members in Blair's office are also terrific, lending a very West Wing flavor to the Blair administration; there's a running joke where one aide keeps bursting in to tell the PM how his approval rating is climbing in response to the crisis.  The characters' warm camaraderie leaves the viewer wanting more, always a good thing. <br /> <br />The royals come across as one might expect: Prince Philip (James Cromwell) is a crusty boor, the most hard-line traditionalist, though some of his observations are spot-on and screamingly funny.  Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) is portrayed more or less sympathetically as a man caught between his domineering parents and his ex-wife's celebrity.  Sylvia Syms is great fun as the Queen Mother, providing much of the humor (her reaction when she realizes Diana's funeral will be based around plans for her own--because it's the only funeral that's been rehearsed--is just priceless).  Princes William and Harry are only glimpsed from behind, probably because they were still quite young at the time of their mother's death.  The bevy of servants and secretaries is excellent. <br /> <br />Uniformly stellar performances really sell this movie.  Any number of superlatives has been heaped on Mirren for her performance, all of them deserved.  She rarely lets the queen's resolute self-control drop, but underneath the starchy surface, there's a lot of emotion going on, and Mirren lets the viewer see that with the subtlest gestures and expressions.  She does a marvelous job conveying Elizabeth's slow change of heart, her annoyance with Blair (and her ultimate respect for him), her concern for her grandsons, and her profound sense of duty to her country.  In perhaps her best scene, Elizabeth finally returns to London to make a public appearance; Mirren's expressions are fabulous as the queen takes in the mourners and the flowers, realizing viscerally the extent of people's grief. <br /> <br />Mirren has a terrific foil in Sheen, who also hits every note perfectly as Blair, from the prime minister's awkwardness around the queen to his frustration with her and eventually his admiration for her when she addresses the people.  The two share a scene at the film's end where Elizabeth cautions Blair that one day the public will turn on him, unexpectedly, just as it turned on her, an open, honest exchange that perfectly bookends their initial meeting at the opening of the movie. <br /> <br />The visuals are top-rate as well, bringing life and depth to the characters' worlds.  Balmoral looks like a big old hunting lodge--all wood and earth tones, stags' heads mounted on the walls--and the surrounding countryside is breathtaking in its rugged wildness.  The Blairs' home is warm and cluttered, covered with their children's artwork, and that cozy informality extends right into the prime minister's office.  The shots of the various characters in their sleepwear are both hilarious and poignant: Elizabeth wears a big fuzzy bathrobe, and Blair wears a sports jersey with his name on the back.  These intimate portraits really help sell the characters as flesh-and-blood people: the queen fumbling for her glasses in the middle of the night, the prime minister watching telly while munching down a bowl of cereal.  Ultimately it is these moments of humanity that make the film so enjoyable, the glimpses--even fictional--of the private lives behind the public faces, the inward and outward responses to tragedy and loss. <br /> <br />The Queen isn't playing in wide distribution (yet), but it's well worth the time to seek out.  For anyone who enjoys interpersonal drama, great character work, and superb acting, movies don't get much better than this. <br />

B00003CXB2|5.0|There are two DVD versions of LoA. The Limited Edition contains extra documentaries and \\"making of\\" features. However, the Superbit Collection release (now out of print, but readily available) offers no extras but higher picture quality.  <br /> <br />I have owned both versions. The extra features on the limited edition are nice, but you'll probably only watch them once. The film is the thing, and the Superbit edition really does offer an improved picture quality. If you are watching DVDs on a small TV, it won't make a real difference. If you are watching on a high definition computer monitor or projection TV, I would recommend the Superbit version. If you want to see the documentary features of the Limited Edition, rent it from Blockbuster or Netflix.  <br /> <br />It appears that all the reviews for LoA are being placed in the listings of both the Limited Edition and the Superbit Collection. I am adding this info so that hopefully people can choose wisely in their purchase. Even the Superbit version has some flaws in mastering, but it is cleaner and clearer, so bear this in mind.  <br /> <br />As for the artistic and entertainment quality of the film itself, suffice it to say that I believe it is in a tie with the Lord of the Rings trilogy for the best movie ever made. But whereas the Lord of the Rings had to rely on digital trickery for its vast battle scenes, Lawrence shows real people, hundreds if not thousands, in a story that is both a sweeping epic and a personal journey. (Much like Lord of the Rings.)  <br /> <br />Whichever version you buy, buy and study this wonderful film -- more relevant than ever now, with our intense involvement in the Middle East.
B000002JSJ|3.0|Rolling Stone magazine recently printed that \\"Presence\\" was the finest Zeppelin album.  I was really shocked to read that.  For it's thirty year lifetime \\"Presence\\" has always been viewed as a minor Zeppelin album, a quickie take on the vibe of the magnificent \\"Physical Graffitti,\\" an album hovering near the bottom of the Zep canon.  The RS comment prompted me to pull the thing out and spin it again looking for new revelations.  Sorry, could not find them.  \\"Presence\\" is still \\"Presence.\\" If you dig Zeppelin you need to have it (if for the awesome \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" alone), but it pales when compared to Zep's fourth album and second album, and is especially weak compared to \\"Physical Graffitti.\\"  The album just seems so one-dimensional -- the creativity of \\"Houses of the Holy\\" and \\"Physical Graffitti\\" seems to be on hold.  A song like \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" just goes on and on, holding on to limited musical ideas where a detour would have made it a better listen.  Sorry, Rolling Stone, you got this one wrong.  Three stars, definitely.
B00005JPBP|4.0|MOVIE: The Prestige is Christopher Nolan's new thriller and also the second film about magicians that we've seen in the past few months. A lot of people compare it to The Illusionist, but in fact we have two very different films here. The Prestige tells the story of Robert (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred (Christian Bale), two friends who make their living as magicians in London. The two start to become competatitve and try and outdo each other with every new trick. When Alfred performs the amazing transportation trick it drives Robert insane as he tries to figure out the secret. His assistant played by Michael Caine says he uses a double, but Robert believes otherwise. He travels to see Nikola Tesla (played surprisingly well by David Bowie), a mysterious man who designed a machine for Alfred once. Tesla's assistant is played by the one and only Andy Serkis who is finally branching away from Peter Jackson. What follows is a great and entertaining film, but it's really more about the tricks and the twists than it is about the characters.<br /><br />  The film is incredibly stylish and it has Christopher Nolan written all over it. He crafts a great film and follows the structure of the magician's act. Act one of the film is indeed the pledge, and we see something that seems ordinary but probably isn't. This seemingly innocent rivalry is more than meets the eye. Act two is the turn in where the magician makes this ordinary something become extraordinary. This point comes when Alfred performs the inexplicably amazing transportation trick. We think we know what's going on, but Nolan knows where he's leading his audience; we know nothing. The final act is called the prestige, where all the twists and turns are presented to the audience. Once this suspense ride finally resolves and ends, the audience is left sitting tensely in their seats as the screen fades to black. \\"Directed By Christopher Nolan\\" appears on the screen and we realize who the true magician is. The film is a wild ride with incredible atmosphere and great acting. You truly are captivated by the setting of the film. David Julyan's tense ambient score keeps things on the edge and Wally Pfister's dark and muted cinematography creates the perfect mood. The only flaw of the film is the lack of emotion we as the audience have for the characters. Throughout the entire film we are thinking \\"oh, what turn is going to happen next?!\\", not \\"what is going to happen to Robert!\\". Don't get me wrong, the characters are strong enough to carry the film, but the film should be centered around them not the magic.<br /><br />ACTING: As in terms of acting we get a fine slate. Christopher Nolan brings his Batman Begins buddies back and we have Christian Bale and Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman has the lead role with supporting work from David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Scarlett Johansson. Christian Bale steals the show and crafts a very deceiving character, which all the more helps the impact of the twist ending. Bale finally gets to act with his native English accent, and it's interesting to hear him with it since we are so used to him speaking with an American accent. Hugh Jackman does a superb job at matching Bale's screen presence. The acting is great all around, and it always is when it's a Nolan film.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Nolan delivers a crafty and suspenseful film. It's visually stunning with great cinematography and set design. However, on the character side it lacks to deliver an emotional punch, the film is purely contextual. It's a great movie though that promises to entertain.s a wild ride with incredible atmosphere and great acting. You truly are captivated by the setting of the film. David Julyan's tense ambient score keeps things on the edge and Wally Pfister's dark and muted cinematography creates the perfect mood. The only flaw of the film is the lack of emotion we as the audience have for the characters. Throughout the entire film we are thinking \\"oh, what turn is going to happen next?!\\", not \\"what is going to happen to Robert!\\". Don't get me wrong, the characters are strong enough to carry the film, but the film should be centered around them not the magic. <br /> <br />ACTING: As in terms of acting we get a fine slate. Christopher Nolan brings his Batman Begins buddies back and we have Christian Bale and Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman has the lead role with supporting work from David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Scarlett Johansson. Christian Bale steals the show and crafts a very deceiving character, which all the more helps the impact of the twist ending. Bale finally gets to act with his native English accent, and it's interesting to hear him with it since we are so used to him speaking with an American accent. Hugh Jackman does a superb job at matching Bale's screen presence. The acting is great all around, and it always is when it's a Nolan film. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: Nolan delivers a crafty and suspenseful film. It's visually stunning with great cinematography and set design. However, on the character side it lacks to deliver an emotional punch, the film is purely contextual. It's a great movie though that promises to entertain.
B000002JSN|5.0|Yep, this is a monster.  The best hard rock record ever: exotic, lyrical, sensual, bone-rattling, and explosive.  Not just Zeppelin's greatest achievement, but one of the greatest albums of the 70s.  Page conjures up a palace of rock guitar (somehow I think the architectural reference paired with the maqic connotation here sums up perfectly the way I experience this music): his playing on \\"Kashmir\\" is as transportive as this kind of music has ever gotten.  If you think you care about rock music at all then you have to have this one.  Put it on and marvel that bands like Zeppelin once walked the earth.
B00005JPB4|4.0|MOVIE: Clint Eastwood has been on an extremely hot streak. He delivered a good film with Mystic River, a little overrated in my opinion, but still a strong and solid film. He then took the cake with Million Dollar Baby. Flags Of Our Fathers is a great story about courage and honor, but honestly so is every war story. The three central characters are Doc (Ryan Phillipe), Rene (Jesse Bradford), and Ira (Adam Beach). The film is told as a flashback through a series of interviews as we learn that the son of Doc is doing some research about his father. We jump back and forth to present day, back to the war, and to the characters after the war as they returned home as \\"heroes\\". William Broyles, Jr. and Paul Haggis wrote the screenplay and did a great job of structuring it. The characters start out together, they go on this journey together, but they soon start to separate. They are brought home because it is believed that they put up the flag at Iwo Jima, but in reality it was the second flag put up, the replacement flag. So, now they are brought home as heroes and we see how they are treated and used. One aspect of the film that made it unique was it's commentary on America's tolerance to Native Americans. Native Americans played a huge role in WWII, and even though our protagonists were heroes Ira was still treated like trash. He is constantly called \\"chief\\" or \\"redskin\\" and in one scene he is thrown out of a bar because they don't serve Indians. It's a sad sight to see how Americans treated the Native Americans who fought and died for freedom. Adam Beach gives a strong performance, it's a truly emotional film. The film is also visually striking.<br /><br />  You can't help but wonder how the film would have looked without Steven Spielberg being the Executive Producer on the project. There are some striking similarities, visually speaking, to Saving Private Ryan. Eastwood also went with a very muted and gray tinted look. The film is almost black and white, and it does make it feel historical. Tom Stern's cinematography is absolutely breathtaking and is bound for an Oscar nomination. The way light is used in some scenes adds so much depth it's unbelievable and has to be seen. All the great stuff aside there is an aspect of the film that makes it less than spectacular. Clint Eastwood provides another simple score for the film, and while it works for some of his movies it usually doesn't. I was not fond of the score for Mystic River, but I loved Million Dollar Baby's score. This film needed a different sound, and Eastwood's simple keys on the piano only works well near the end of the film. While the action sequences have no music I do think that a more experienced composer could have done wonders for the film.<br /><br />  The war genre has had so many entries over the history of film that I am starting to wonder is there anything left to explore? I mean, every aspect of war has been expressed through film and war movies now are starting to become repetitive. This film is about heroism and that the real heroes of Iwo Jima weren't the ones in the photograph but the ones who died out on that island. Yes, we've heard that before many times, but Eastwood gives us different perspectives on it. I guess it's hard to really analyze Flags Of Our Fathers since Letters From Iwo Jima has yet to come out. For those who did not know, Clint Eastwood made two films at once and Flags Of Our Fathers is the first of two companion pieces. Letters From Iwo Jima is the companion piece and is the same story of Iwo Jima told from the Japanese perspective, spoken in Japanese and all.<br /><br />ACTING: There is no standout character here. This is another example of a great ensemble cast. The acting is great all around even though I question Eastwood's decision to put Paul Walker in this movie. All the actors give solid performances, but it's Adam Beach's performance as Ira Hayes that highlights the film. He is also the only character that makes the film something original.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Clint Eastwood gives an emotional look at the true definition of heroes during the war. The film is visually amazing and the acting is excellent, but the film overal feels like we've seen it before. Hopefully Letters From Iwo Jima will add more depth to this project.akes the film something original. <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: Clint Eastwood gives an emotional look at the true definition of heroes during the war.

B000HIVQK8|4.0|This album is the more compact, less grandiose baby brother to \\"All Things Must Pass.\\"  Being the baby brother means, while many of the same characteristics are readily recognizable, that this record often gets overshadowed. The new reissue gives us the chance to hear this album fresh again and what a great listen it is.  The production is sumptuous, George's voice is sympathetic and unforced, and the songs are authenticly heartfelt.  The two drawbacks of this record are that the melodies have a sameness to them at first listen (repeated hearings help the listener better distinguish the intricate songs on this one)and the religious tone of the lyrics can get a little tedious at times. This is a laidback and supremely confident work from one of the few rock musicians who had anything substantial to say about faith.  The arrangements and musical backing to these tunes give them the perfect context.  The music insinuates itself into the consciousness of the hearer, making repeated listening a must. This is rock music well worth taking the time to get to know.  This is a gorgeous record that has the potential to enfold you if not necessarily excite you.
0060555661|5.0|Benjamin Graham forever changed the landscape of investing when he published the first of edition of his classic, The Intelligent Investor. This revised edition focuses on the 1972 update with present day(2003) commentary from Jason Zweig of Money Magazine. Zweig helps apply Graham's principles to modern era scenarios, and succeeds quite well.  <br /> <br />Originally I was going to opt for the Classic version but decided to go with this copy, and I am more than glad I did, Zweig's commentary adds a new perspective which allows one to better understand Graham's philosophy.  <br /> <br />Intelligent Investor is a must read for anyone seriously interested in the financial markets, from student to professional everyone can benefit handsomely from his time tested advice.
B00006RCNJ|5.0|Very pleased with this DVD.  Great quality, shipped quickly, have two others like it and enjoy all three.  I always enjoy shopping with Amazon and will continue to do so.
B00005JNS0|3.0|Of all the movies Pixar has made this one left me the least amused once I left the theatre.  There's nothing wrong with it and it is cute (but not really funny).  The soundtrack is great for the movie but it's pretty cliche.    The soundtrack in particular does not hold a candle to the ones Randy Newman made for the Toy Story movies.  \\"Life is a Highway\\" rocks out and starts the movie with a serious bang, but my 6 year old thought it was too loud.  A lot of little kids were holding their ears at the start of the movie.   <br /> <br />The plot is entertaining but it doesn't really function on that \\"next level\\" that many of the Pixar movies do.  And it is impossible not to remember \\"Doc Hollywood\\" with Michael J. Fox and think Fox would not have been better than Owen Wilson as Lightning McQueen. <br /> <br />I guess I think Monsters, Inc. and the Toy Story movies were much better than this one because they created characters that expanded out of the worlds of children.  Also, Monster, Inc. and Finding Nemo both talk to the adults in the audience about parenting while entertaining the kids you went with to the movie.  It's just genius that they can pull that off.  I don't see Cars trying to pull off anything so admirable, heck, it doesn't even function on a level other than the one the kids are watching, too.  I admit there is a nostalgia thing going that kids might not quite understand but it is an upfront part of the movie plot.  The nostalgia gets a little drippy too and probably takes aim at grandparents more than 35-year-old parents because it is all about \\"life before the interstate\\" which was created in the late 50's early 60's...
B000E41MS6|5.0|As a long time fan of the original, campy, Dr. Who of the BBC of the 60's and 70's, I was very skeptical of a new Doctor for the new century. My skepticism is now gone, washed away by the Doctor and his new assistant. The new Doctor has marvelous special effects at his disposal and still brings off to perfection that near manic energy, camp, and sense of fun of the old series.<br /><br />I'll watch the series on TV, but I prefer to buy the DVDs so I can have the captioning if I need it and so I can miss out on all the commercials.<br /><br />This is a very slick, professional package. I recommend it highly.
B000022TSW|5.0|When the 4 boys Stan, Kyle, Cartman and Kenny sneek into an R-rated Canadian animated flick featuring their two favorite Canadian heroes known as Terrence and Philip they start to repeat the extremely foul language from that movie. Kyle's mother starts to blame the makers of the movie and Canada for what it has done to all the kids in South Park, now Canada begins to go to war against America, there is a prophecy that once Terrence and Philip will be executed then Satan along with Saddam Hussan will take over the world but only the South Park kids can stop this from happening.<br /><br />One of the most brilliant and funniest animated movies of all time! this is not kids stuff here folks, there's lots of extreme foul language with graphic  animated violence, sexual jokes and bodily functions galore. The cut-out animation blended with CGI is just as good as the show's and the humor is sick but funny, there is some musical numbers like the memorable \\"Shut your F face uncle-f'er\\" and the film is a twisted yet comical view about censorship.<br /><br />The DVD has great picture and sound but the only extras is three trailers, nevertheless this is a must have animated movie but keep your kids away from this movie.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|I bought this album not expecting to find a new favorite artist, as well as a CD that has received heavy rotation in my car. I call this album the lovechild of Hip Hop & Soul because it is just that. With Cee-Lo's soulful voice & repertoire and the beats & rhythms created by Danger Mouse, no one can resist to close their eyes, snap their fingers or stomp their feet. Progressive rhymes about the grundgyness of life, as well as the joy of living, are portrayed throughout. This is definately a good buy.
0380789019|5.0|I began reading Neverwhere simply because I had already read two other books by Neil Gaiman and liked them (Anansi Boys and American Gods), so decided to try his work for a third time. And I'm very glad I did. Neverwhere is a great story: well written, believable characters, and a very good storyline with many good twists and turns in the plot. Before reading this book, Anansi Boys was my favorite Neil Gaiman book, but Neverwhere just might end up beating it to be on my list of favorites. Both stories are somewhat similar in that the main character is a shy, unassuming, and mild nice guy who has so far always been pushed around in life because of it. But then the world he lives in changes into something very strange, and he has to change with it, becoming a stronger, more assertive hero. It definitely reminds me of a dark, comedic horror-ish, modernized Alice in Wonderland tale, or your own pseudo-nightmarish dream.<br /><br />To be fair, there were two things I didn't really like about the novel, but they are both minor quibbles with the plot itself. I can't say too much without giving away spoilers, so I'll just suffice it to say they both involved the Big Bad Guy, but thankfully these quibbles didn't detract from the enjoyment of the story. They were just little flaws of reason and logic in the plot, in my opinion. Otherwise, a very good plot.<br /><br />And to wrap up, there were many points in the novel where I found myself thinking of it in terms of a big screen movie. The visualizations, dialog, and pace of the story all lent itself well to a movie adaptation, in my opinion. And I just discovered that it sort of had been: The BBC made a miniseries out of Neverwhere back in 2003, however from what I've read about it, it was very low-budget, kind of hokey, and probably not done nearly as well as it really deserved. The DVD of this BBC miniseries can be bought on Amazon, and I plan on getting it soon to see for myself. I do hope Neil Gaiman can get this novel re-done as a movie or miniseries, though.<br /><br />Gift Idea: Like Anansi Boys, I think this book would be a great gift to some teenager or young adult who likes deep, intelligent novels.or miniseries, though.

6305882592|5.0|On the face of it, a movie about a suicidal teen who develops a semi-romantic attachment to an ancient woman seems about as \\"niche\\" as you can get, but don't overlook this film. The relationship between Harold and Maude is truly endearing, and is as heartbreakingly dear as it is comedic. Through Maude (Ruth Gordon in a role that will forever define the agelessness of the human spirit) we get a truly unique perspective on life, told in such a gracefully sweet way that we cannot help but fall in love with her. If you like Igby Goes Down (a modern interpretation of Catcher in the Rye) you'll get much the same feeling from Harold and Maude, which is not so much a \\"coming of age\\" movie as a funny-but-deep look at love in all its splendours.
0553583182|5.0|Thank you for taking time to read my post.  I want to start off by saying that we all have that little voice that goes off in our head.  Doubt,fear,worry,jealous,etc.  We see people with these beutifull things in life, and one of the basic Universal Laws in life is to be abundunt as they are.  Most people are envious of other successfull people.  They see the Trumps, the Dell's,Forbes and resent what they have.  Dr. Murphy teaches you to tranform your mind and Bless them.  Bless what you want.  If you want a new house, visualize yourself in your new house.  Describe everything you want in your new house, the color, what part of town you want to live in, the square footage, everything.  Believe the house is already yours, and claim it!  Affirm it is mine now, and see what happens.  When you plants seeds into your sub-consious mind, it's just like planting seeds into soil.  Once the seeds are planted, the plant will grow 10 fold.  It's the same with your mind, when you plant seeds of peace,harmony,love, and tranquility ever flowing through your mind and soul, it will happen. <br /> <br />Remeber poverty is a disease.  Tt's a disease of the mind.  If you sit around thinking about how Broke you are all the time, you will become.  If you think about all the debt you have, you will remain.  If you think about positive thoughts, and affirm it, you will become.  I say these exact words all the time , \\"Infinite Intellegience overflows my mind body and soul.  I am sucessfull now.  I am healthy now.  I am propserous now.\\"  You have no idea how this will transform your mind, body and soul.  It's crazy stuff I know, but just what  Dr. Murphy says \\"What you sow, you reap\\" Which in theory all stems from Biblical principles.  Remember, God lives in you.  Does God want to be broke, have no clothes, live in poverty??  Absolutely not!  God(which is living inside you) wants to fill propserous also, wants nice clothes, wants the nice car, the nice house,etc.   Remember, you want these things, and so does God. <br /> <br />I don't care where you are at in you life today, you can chnage it Now.  But, you have to have a clear consious before you make any progess.  Start with this book.  I bought it literally 3 weeks ago today, and since   <br />then have bought an additional 3 books.  If you know anybody whith Dr. Murphy CD's or Tapes, please let me know.  I would listen to them everyday.  May God Bless you and enrich your life, buy his Book today!!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series really grows on you. I hadn't seen it before ordering it, but I became interested after watching some trailers on FOX TV for the series (that I could never catch) and a trailer for the final movie in another DVD. I decided to risk it and ordered the whole series. <br /> <br />Boy, was I pleasantly surprised. I was delighted with the characters, the wit, the plot, and the humor. It's not a deluxe ship and it's not a completely moral crew, but they have their standards, and the fact that you are watching normal people trying to survive with their wits in the wilderness of space is what sells this series for you. I loved the modern-western-chinese mix a lot too. <br />

0143057375|2.0|After reading The Power of Now and listening to the book on CD several times, I greatly anticipated his subsequent books.  I am very disappointed in his re-hashing the same information in his other books.  In A New Earth, Tolle speaks with a strong disdain for his fellow humans.  After a while I got tired of hearing about how \\"sick\\" and deranged we are.  In Conversations with God, many of the same things are said, but you leave feeling uplifted and hopeful.  Tolle's reading of his book leaves one feeling either depressed or irritated. Perhaps Tolle is so enlightened that he finds it difficult to be among his \\"unenlightened\\" brethren.  To me, a sure sign of not being enlightened is judgment, and he seems full of that in this book. Not that I'm judging!
0062502182|4.0|Standing in the Amsterdam airport bookshop, I recognized this title based on a friend's recommendation and bought it. It's a short, mostly sunny read. The dreamer in me wants to buy into Coelho's premise. The cynic in me thinks that it's easy for a fiction writer to string together an amazing series of coincidences. I agree that if you figure out what you want you should go at it with everything you've got. The trick is figuring out what you want and not getting stuck in your current surroundings in the process. I recommended it to my 12-year old daughter, who's both a dreamer and a cynic, like me.

Two things to know, some of the items are harder than others, especially for a three year old, and you have to help.  They can do the prints, but you will need to do the detail work.  The book offers many creative ideas for finger and thumb prints.  I'm using it again this year on pottery at one of those paint your own places.  If you aren't creative, let this book help you.

B000FQ4M58|4.0|This is by far the best non-Steinman produced Meatloaf album out there. While it may sound like I'm not saying much, let me qualify it by saying that this album definitely deserves the Bat Out of Hell title. Meatloaf is back on top of his game with this album. And while a lot of the notes you'll see me make on the songs may sound negative, let me assure you these are mostly nit-picks and the album itself is a solid buy. <br /> <br />Album Art: done by the wonderfully talented Julie Bell. She and Boris Vallejo have long been among my favorite artists. Meatloaf did good in commissioning her. <br /> <br />All Coming Back to Me: This isn't my favorite rendition. As much as some people seem to hate Celine Dion for her version, hers was quite a bit closer to Pandora's Box. When there are two other versions of the song that are virtually identical, having a deviation like Meatloaf's is a bit jarring. But it's not even the difference that makes me score this one low. Marion Raven is just too high pitched for this song. She sounded downright shrill to me. It sounded like she was trying to combat Meatloaf for the lead vocals. She nearly succeeded in one part where they both sounded like they were singing backup and there wasn't a lead vocalist to be found.  <br /> <br />In the Land of the Pig: All my worries were laid to rest with this song. This proved to me that Meatloaf is as intense as ever. He's really at the top of his game with this song. Heavy riffs and unrelenting lyrics really make this one shine. <br /> <br />Monstro: This is the intermezzo of the album. There's nothing as interesting or cleverly twisted like Jim Steinmen's skits, but it does the job very well. It's a nice bridge for the second half of the album. <br /> <br />If it Ain't Broke: This is just a little too \\"pop-music\\" for me. It didn't seem to fit in with the rest of the album. While it is a really good song, and by itself would earn a high rating from me, it just doesn't mesh well with the whole. <br/> <br />What About Love: This one features Patti Ruso. Not surprising, she has the best chemistry with Meatloaf out of all of the duets on this album. There's just a quality to how these two sing together. Meat's noticeably more comfortable with Patti than he was with Marion or Jennifer, and it shows. Great song. <br /> <br />Seize the Night: This samples music from both Good Girls go to Heaven from Bat II and the next song The Future Ain't What it Used to Be. While it may be a decent song, it samples too much from the other two songs. It uses them as a crutch. To the point, it seems like a song too afraid to stand on its own.  <br /> <br />Future Ain't What it Used to be: This is a great song. This is another cover originally done by Pandora's Box. The problem here is that the original had a charm that Meatloaf just doesn't match. The original had an air of loneliness and utter despair that doesn't come across when you add in a duet. Still, it is a great cover to a great song. It's only because I heard Pandora's Box first that I even have any issues at all with this song. It has a charm all its own with Meatloaf and is definitely a good listen to. <br /> <br />Cry to Heaven: Future Ain't What it Used to be honestly would have made a better end note for the album. This makes it feel like Bat III actually has two endings. But Cry still makes a nice mellow out.  <br /> <br />Even given the criticisms listed above, this is still a great album. I highly recommend it to anyone who's ever liked Meatloaf. He proves that he still has what it takes.  <br />
B000IOM0YM|5.0|In the 70s Kiss was it. It was cool to be into Kiss. In the 80s, it was the exact opposite. By the late 80s and early 90s the makeup was off and Kiss were a (no pun intended) washed up \\"bunch of posers.\\"<br /><br />This DVD dispels the myth that Kiss were ever posers. They indeed were always great musicians and they were the inspiration for many metal bands rocking your world today (rumor has it that while backstage at a 70s Kiss show Eddie Van Halen's signature guitar tapping was inspired while seeing Ace Frehley do it). And Kiss so happen to have put on one of the most theatrical shows in rock and roll history.<br /><br />And that history is captured on this 2-disk DVD, albeit mostly with terrible video quality.<br /><br />Man, did I ever enjoy being able to see the original line-up of Kiss perform on these disks. The thing is that the awesome performances on these disks are mostly footage from 1974 - 1977 live shows, so the quality is early 70s video...and that ain't good. Often times in the live performances there are major reminders that the video is dated: horizontal lines across the picture, complete picture blackouts and just plain old low quality video.<br /><br />On the other hand, the audio on the first two disks is a completely different story. The audio wizards cleaned up the sound on Disks 1 & 2 and they've offered it with a terrific 5.1 Dolby mix.<br /><br />After enjoying what was more of a front row seat experience with the quality HD video and surround sound on the awesome, 5-star Rock the Nation 2004 DVD by Kiss, the live performances in the Kissology set were reduced to mere DVD viewings.

089381525X|5.0|The bikes we ride, the tuna we eat, the oil that runs our cars, the gold we wear, are all manufactured,  fished, drilled, mined, by countless people in remote corners of the world, often under extremely difficult and dangerous conditions, and more often than not, for extremely low wages. In this beautiful book, the Brazilian economist turned photographer Sebastiao Salgado put his Art to the Service of Humanity, to give us a window to the rest of the World that remains hidden from our TV screens and from our consciousness. The pictures are magnificent, and as true Art should, their impeccable technnique is there to serve the greater purpose of conveying meaning and emotion.
0887307280|5.0|I am an avid reader and I am a web designer too. So when I stared at the cover of this book and saw the word \\"E-Myth,\\" I decided to pick it up thinking the author was addressing an issue relating to the Internet or the Web. <br /> <br />After reading a single page I was sucked into this book like I haven't been sucked in by a book in a long time. For the first time ever, I felt I was reading a business book intended for the little guy, those of us who harbor a dream; those of us who have suffered from the dreaded entrepreneurial seizure; those of us who have the audacity to think we can build a business that is special.  <br /> <br />Having had a business for 2 years at the time, I felt as if Gerber understood my pain EXACTLY. I saw my situation completely laid out in page after page. Sara's story was my story! And boy, was I glad to hear that rather than being a freak and a failure, I was simply growing through a phase in the normal life of most businesses. My situation, Gerber notes, is typical. <br /> <br />Gerber's book is a gem. It gives us a new paradigm, a fresh way of looking at our business that will change your outlook forever.  <br /> <br />But Gerber can only show you the door, you have to walk through it!

B000IJ79WU|5.0|I haven't been this excited to own a DVD in a long time! In fact, if everything that I've been hearing regarding this DVD release is true, Warner Bros. might actually want to consider releasing this NEW version to the BIG SCREEN as well! This isn't JUST a director's cut, it's practically a WHOLE NEW film!    Richard Donner, the director of Superman \\"the movie\\" completed 75% of Superman II in 1977. Donner was actually hired to film the first movie AND the sequel at the SAME time! But before he could film the final 25% of Superman II, Richard Donner was fired and a terrible \\"hack\\" named Richard Lester was hired to complete the film. The Marlon Brando footage was removed (so that the producers would not have to pay Brando) and the script was given a quick re-write. When Richard Lester finally resumed production of the film in 1979 he decided to re-film the MAJORITY of the story. He ended up TRASHING about 45% of everything that Donner had filmed and replaced it with quickly shot, poorly directed scenes. Gene Hackman quit, he did not want to work with Richard Lester. A body double was used to replace Hackman in several scenes that had not yet been filmed. John Williams also quit stating that he \\"could not work with the man\\" (in regards to Richard Lester). Both Christopher Reeve and Margo Kidder WANTED to quit but were contractually obligated to finish the project.    In the end, the version of Superman II that finally made it to the theater in late 1980 (Europe) and 1981 (U.S.) can be broken down like this:    70% filmed in 1979 by Richard Lester.  30% filmed in 1977 by Richard Donner.    This new DVD version breaks down like this:    75% filmed in 1977 by Richard Donner  8% filmed in 2006  17% filmed in 1979 by Richard Lester (re-edited in 2006).    50% of this new \\"edit\\" should be footage NEVER BEFORE SEEN by the public! Mostly stuff that was filmed by Donner in 1977 and then trashed by Richard Lester in 1979.    I'm hoping this new version lives up to the hype, but I'm not expecting a perfect film. Keep in mind that this is a movie that was shot 30 years ago!    I'm giving the DVD 5 stars without even viewing the film simply because I think the idea itself (gathering all of the original footage and allowing Donner to complete the film... 30 years later) is absolutely incredible!    Now that this film has finally seen the light of day, I can only hope for the following releases:    * \\"Back to the Future; the Eric Stoltz version\\" I know it may not even exist (according to most accounts), but there are a few sources online that claim that ALL of the Eric Stoltz scenes were filmed. I can dream can't I?    * Original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy (fully RESTORED plus the deleted scenes)    * \\"Superman the movie\\" enhanced with new CGI effects, ONLY where it seriously NEEDS it. Mostly at the end of the film, the town flood, bridge, and earthquake sequence could certainly use a revamping! I would only use CGI to correct and improve the old effects shots that NEED fixing. I would not pull a \\"George Lucas\\" and ruin the film by changing it too much! This film really does need some fixing. It's a true classic in every way, but the BAD model effects at the end of the film need to be fixed!!!    I'll update my review once I actually watch the new version of superman II!    ----------- UPDATED REVIEW -----------    A lot of excellent reviews have appeared since my initial review/announcement of this DVD's arrival. I cannot really add more to the argument, but I would like to simply bring my review up to date.    I agree completely with those reviewers pointing out flaws with this version, it's certainly not a perfect film. You have to remember that it was NEVER finished to begin with and Richard Donner had to FIGHT every step of the way to TRY to achieve his vision. If he had been allowed to finish the ENTIRE superman project (both films) in the way that he had originally intended (without constant interference and script altering), we may have ended up with two truly GREAT films.    Those voicing dissapointment with the ending of this film must remember that it was indeed the ORIGINAL ending. When \\"Superman: The movie\\" was rushed to completion they simply took the ending from Superman II and used it to complete the first film. After Donner was fired, Superman II was left without an ending. I'm quite content to see the ORIGINAL ending used.    Also, after comparing both the Lester and Donner versions - I can say without a doubt that the Donner version is FAR superior. The film certainly has flaws, but that's primarily due to the fact that it was never finished to begin with. Modern viewers must also remember that this film is almost 30 years old. If you're a fan of the current crop of CGI based super-hero movies then this film might be a let down.    Watch both versions back to back. You'll be amazed at how much better the Donner version is. I'm not claiming that it's a GREAT film, but I am claiming that you'll become painfully aware of just how BAD the Lester version is. It will leave you wondering just what Richard Donner might have accomplished with BOTH superman films had he simply been left alone by the producers.      -JM

B00005JPAJ|4.0|With a plot structure not unlike his previous Amores Perros or 21 Grams, director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and writer Guillermo Arriaga have created Babel, the final act of a trilogy about the human condition.  With seemingly unrelated characters and storylines that gradually merge, it is as ambitious as a narrative can get, and the filmmakers pull it off with great aplomb. <br />  <br />Four parallel stories take place within days if not hours of each other.  In Morocco, the father of a goat herding family buys a rifle from a neighbor.  Set to guard the flock from predators, his two sons decide to do some target practice.  As a tour bus happens by, a single shot rings out, and a careless act will create havoc and distress for innocent victims and have severe repercussions for others.   <br />  <br />In the bus, an American couple, Richard (Brad Pitt) and Susan (Cate Blanchett), are having a marital crisis when all of a sudden their world is turned upside down.   The tour bus stops at a remote village as the passengers begin to stir and fear for their own safety.  As the Moroccan police investigate the incident, Richard is desperate to save the life of his wife amid primitive surroundings in a foreign land.   <br />  <br />The couple's two children in California are under the care of their nanny, Amelia (Adriana Barraza), who is anxious to go to her son's impending wedding.  After failing to find suitable caregivers to watch over the children, she takes them with her to Mexico.  Escorted by her volatile nephew Santiago (Gael Garcia Bernal), they drive to a festive wedding ceremony and reception.  Afterwards, they are stopped at a border checkpoint where events turn nightmarish.   <br />  <br />In Japan, a lonely teenaged girl, Chieko (Rinko Kikuchi) who is deaf, hangs with her other deaf friends and dreams of flirting and connecting with a male even if it means compromising her dignity.  Her father, Yasujiro (Koji Yakusho) is inadequate as a parent since his wifedied under obscure circumstances.  As detectives want to question Yasujiro, Cheiko is smitten by a younger detective and unleashes a torrent of passion and secrets. <br />  <br />The final moments of the film are memorable as each storyline becomes clearer and potent in their revelations and truths.  Time slips back and forth and certain events catch up to the others (Christopher Nolan's Momento comes to mind).  The threads that connect the different stories are not as obvious as one might expect and when they do become apparent, they hold emotional meaning.  What is so remarkable is how a seemingly innocent prank sets off a chain reaction of angst and responsibility.   <br />  <br />The film does not sermonize but rather it presents the events as they happen albeit in an incongruent time frame. You experience life and its effects on other events and people.  The director and writer try to depict people like you or me with the same needs or longings.  With a setting that reaches the far-flung corners (Japan, Mexico or Morocco) of the world, Inarritu has forced his audience to go with him and face a myriad of characters that speak English, Japanese, Spanish, Arabic, Berber, or French!  Yet when we get to know these disparate individuals and their situations, we begin to empathize and care for them despite their faults or shortcomings.  Although the title has biblical references with its different languages, these stories share common emotional bonds that transcend mere dialects.  This is a film that could easily play anywhere in the world and still be affecting. <br />  <br />The international cast melds amateurs with seasoned veterans and the honest performances are completely captivating and affecting.  I dare anyone to pick out the professional actors from the non professionals (save Pitt and Blanchett).  This use of unknowns adds to the believability of the whole storyline.  (It is ironic that Michael Pena plays a border policeman; he was featured in last year'ssimilarly structured Crash-a coincidence perhaps?) <br />  <br />There are painful, agonizing moments where human suffering is brought with unflinching, explicit realism to an almost unbearable level.  This film presents characters with all their strengths and weaknesses and it does so unsparingly.  Sometimes the punishment or consequences unfairly outweigh the crime or the mistake.  The brothers who watch over their father's goats must face their own culpability and ugly family secrets that threaten to destroy their way of life.  There are Richard and Susan who are at the center or eye of a growing hurricane of life's cruel randomness and must depend on strangers for survival.   A jaunt across a Mexican border turns ugly. <br />  <br />Things are not wrapped up nicely, and several plot threads are left hanging and open-ended on purpose.  The marital problems of Richard and Susan are never clearly delineated and their relationship gets short shrift even as they go through a harrowing event.  The music is somber and spare.  The imagery is powerful despite the handheld documentary feel. The scenes of Japanese nightlife are vivid and disturbing in their portrayal of urban youth. <br />  <br />Babel is about how families are torn apart and come together.  It is also about children. It could be your children or mine or the world's children.  There are some significant issues (racial tension, illegal immigrants, adolescent yearnings, perceptions of a foreign country, and the arrogance of the `ugly American') the filmmakers touch upon and you wish they had gone even farther with the material, but you are glad they went as far as they did.   Babel is a film that this reviewer has no desire to sit through again, but having gone through it once, it is a unique, remarkable experience.  This is an imperfect, significant film and destined for major Oscar nominations. <br /> <br /> <br />
0061122416|5.0|I loved \\"The Alchemist Plus\\" and found it spellbinding and enlightening. It's the type of book you can't put down, until the very last page, and then wish it continued. I recommend the book to anyone who would like to take a realistic journey and, possibly, learn a few things about themselves.

1904920209|5.0|This book has wonderful pictures that accompany each recipe and all the techniques in it.  Not only that, the included DVD, although not a masterpiece of cinematography, really shows how to follow the often complicated steps in bread-making. <br /> <br />Included in the recipes are several which I have never found in any other baking book, like how to make soup bowls out of bread, and a bread shell to stuff with salads.  There is also a recipe for 100% whole-wheat bread for those interested, which many books don't touch.  All-in-all, a very good book to start off with.

B0001ZXM54|5.0|The weird thing about ZZ Top has to do with the remix jobs that were done on all of their early albums in the eighties and early nineties. ZZ Top, somehow went through a real heavy faze of synthing their drums on all of their albums between 1983 and 1990, and when they released their seventies albums onto CD the drums were remixed to give those albums a synth drum sound as well. To this day pretty much any Top album you buy on CD has been metamorphasized. Quite a shame since early Top had a real nice, gritty, dancin' in the dirt kind of sound. It's best to buy those albums on vinyl, cassette, or even 8-track..  way more bad Ace quality.<br /><br />HOWEVER!!!!<br /><br />The red disc in this 2-disc greatest hits packaged focuses specially on treating those old seventies rockers right, and for the first time on CD these songs sound the way they were meant to sound. RAW and glorious. This two disc collection is a must have, simply for the first disc alone.<br /><br />Just listen to the difference on obvious songs like LA GRANGE and TUSH. The sound is supremely better here than on that other greatest hits pack, the one with the blonde bomshells on the cover? I bought that one years ago and couldn't figure out why my ZZ Top wasn't rockin'. Now I'm graced with songs that totally blow the speakers off, like JUST GOT PAID and BEER DRINKERS AND HELL RAISERS. They sound mint. Also a huge plus is the boozy JUST GOT BACK FROM BABY... totally forgot how much I dug that tune.<br /><br />The Aqua Blue disc focuses on the 1980's pop MTV stuff. Some of it is ok. The first track TUBE SNAKE BOOGIE should have been on the red disc, but the rest belongs on this Diz-nee like rock disc. Like the eighties club version of Legs and the skinny tie martini version of Viva Las Vegas. Eh. BUT!! as I said... The Red Disc is where it's at.<br /><br />If you BAD, then you should buy most of your ZZ Top stuff on wax, and keep this red disc handy to blow out some hot chickies speakers when the time is right. ZZ TOP truly was one of the greats.e is right. ZZ TOP truly was one of the greats.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This CD really rocks! The songs on here are very awesome! Serj and Daron are great singing together! All of the songs are very awesome!!!

B00005JSGK|5.0|John Wayne, Red Buttons and Elsa Martinelli/this is a fantastic movie for the family. Their professional game hunters in Africa who capture these animals alive and send them to zoos, and circus attrations.  <br />They don't use bullets, but strong ropes and darts that knocks them out. It's really interesting how they capture the wild animals without getting more than bruises, or a broken bone. Also exciting to see them with rhino, giraffes; even cool the way they capture 500 monkeys using one net, and firecrackers.  <br />Then Elsa Martinelli comes to the camp(they thinks she is a guy because she signed her name with initials)and she starts taking the pictures, Then somehow she is adopted by and becomes the mother of four or five baby elephants who have lost their own Moms. she feeds, and waters them to keep them wet and happy. This movie has it all,! <br />It's a fantastic adventure film, the other actors are great, too. The music is by Henry Mancini. My grandchildren love it. <br />Mrs. Shirley Frye........Herndon    11/06

0778321606|5.0|This author is one of my favorites now.  This one book was recommended to me by someone and I have read 7 or so books by her since.

0345479092|5.0|Being an avid reader, by the time I got this book, I had read a TON of baby books.  If you are a new parent, you know that one book will tell you one thing, and another will tell you something else.  So it was very hard for me to sift through it all and determine what advice to follow and what not to.  I finally just decided to let my baby let me know what I needed to do.  (Silly me...)  While this worked for a while, I have recently started to have problems with his sleeping patterns.  He has never been a good napper, but he was sleeping through the night...until 3 weeks ago.  At that point, he started waking up at least once during the night.  Most times he'd eat and then go back to sleep, but occasionally he'd be up and stay up.  After one of those wakeful nights, I called my doctor.  I know my son is capable of sleeping through the night, so it must be something I'm doing that's changed that.  Do you know what they told me?  Well, read this book.  They pretty much told me to do everything that is in this book.  Had I started out following Tracy Hogg's advice, I'd have been spared several sleepless nights! My son still runs our house, but I can at least guide him in learning good sleeping and eating habits, thanks to Ms. Hogg.
B00003CXPD|4.0|This is a movie that I intend to watch again and again.  I, being an artist, appreciate the different struggles portrayed in this film.  It is not easy to be different than your family and friends or to have the fortitude to persue your true self and become who you want to be.<br /><br />This film shows these struggles in a pleasing way.  It has a delightful cast and a wonderful ending.  My kind of film for sure.
0446677450|1.0|The class paranoid title alone moves units and is an indicator of what exactly this guy is selling. I've tried paying attention to him when he and his wife appeared on public television but I just don't get it.  I didn't finish the book because his real estate advice leaves out too many variables.  I get the feeling that he impresses people who have no business experience and those people have reason to fear their own ignorance so he's got them on the hook.  I'm writing this review because I read that he has contacted Casey Serin - the wet behind the ears disaster flipper - to get acquainted AND he is partnering up with Donald Trump.  I think this guy is selling the emperor's clothes I really do.  Lesson One: He's not mentoring future moguls for the price of this paperback. This book is a waste of money.
B00005ATQF|5.0|This movie gets better with age, and it is easier to see Kubrick's genius now then it was when the film was made.  Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, senior drill instructor, is a tour de force.  Who wrote those unforgettable insults and threats? Where did he learn to swear so colorfully and with such literary panasch?  The scene with the jelly donunt is my favorite.  Anybody who has played high school football knows how Private Pyle feels when the jelly donut is discovered, and everybody in the platoon (team) knows what the collective punishment will be.  The characters and the names or unforgettable: Cowboy, Rafterman, Joker, Eightball, Animal Mother...In my opnion it is the best movie about war and the Marines ever made.

There's no denying that this story has captured many readers.<br /><br />Unfortunately for me, I was not one of them.<br /><br />The commitment with a friend to read this book together is probably the only thing that made me stick with it to the end.  Sure, there are mysteries, most of them based on the assumptions that readers naturally make (and Setterfield knows it).  And there's a ghost or two, but the reader can tell that the ghost is more implied in Margaret's case.  But it's just not that great of a story.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that Setterfield creates only one character that I actually cared about--Aurelius--and he was secondary to the plot.  Or so it seems.  The author handles the constant change of narrator well enough, but the characters are simply not that endearing.  I don't mean that in a sappy way, either.  I just couldn't muster a brain cell that cared about anyone other than Aurelius.<br /><br />Setterfield is quite a clever writer, though.  I will give her that.  She has taken central characters and plot lines from the gothic classics like Wuthering Heights and Jane Eyre (to name only two) and used them to create a new story, a sort of gothic hybrid based on the classics.<br /><br />For lovers of the gothic classics, this book may be irresistible.  While I enjoyed seeing how the author used certain techniques and similar story lines from the past, I simply could not \\"get into\\" this story.  I wanted to be transported.  I was not.  I fell for the hype with an open mind, but the Thirteenth Tale simply did not deliver.

B000F3AAUW|5.0|I think St. Elsewhere is an awesome album. Despite the repeated play on radio stations, I still can't get enough of Crazy. The tunes are catchy and put me in a good mood regardless of whether or not I am sitting in the middle of rush hour traffic. :) Rarely do I purchase a CD and end up loving the entire thing, this was an exception. I do not skip one single song once I put this CD in. I am pretty sure this will be in my CD player until Hova drops his new album around Thanksgiving.  <br /> <br />St. Elsewhere = Fantastic, best CD purchase this year
B000F1IQNM|5.0|My children and grand-children almost swears that this is about me. I did thoroughly enjoy this moviem, and it came so quickly, that I'd forgotten about ordering it.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|St. Elsewhere combines the energy of club beats with the soulful [and at times wistful] voice of Cee-Low and thought-provoking lyrics. I enjoy the variety of styles [from the frentic \\"Go-Go Gospel\\" to the introspective \\"Just a Thought\\"]. A must-have purchase.
B000002IST|2.0|It was a great 20 year plus run for the band, but this album shows that like most bands, they hung around one album too long.  <br /> <br />There are some good moments, but the album's length (which by the way makes it almost impossible to get through in one sitting) makes it very difficult to sustain any momentum. Plus, there's \\"Jesus, He Knows Me,\\" the only serious challenger to \\"Illegal Alien\\" as the worst Genesis song ever.
1419364375|4.0|I listened to this on CD. There were different readers for each of the characters which made it even more enthralling. Lots of food for thought in this one.
B000002J2F|3.0|This is the clear transitional album from Progressive Rock to Commercial Pop. Consequently, the album has a little of the old style (\\"Behind The Lines,\\" \\"Dutchess) and the style they would devote the next ten years to (\\"Misunderstanding,\\" \\"Alone Tonight,\\" \\"Turn It On Again.\\") The net result is neither \\"old\\" Genesis fans, or \\"new\\" Genesis fans will be left completely satisfied. When compared to the dreadful Abacab and Invisible Touch, which is essentially a collection of singles as opposed to a cohesive album, Duke is a gem.
B00007KQA3|4.0|Even if you haven't read the book you'll probably get the message of this film. Most of the ideas have filtered into the consciousness of Western man, especially the phrase Big Brother is Watching You. Surely everyone knows what this means. The cast is perfect: Burton, Cusack, Hamilton, Hurt seem to fit their parts exactly. It was a shock to be told that the location shots were filmed in areas of London that actually were in existence in 1984. I recognized Battersea Power Station, and London University Senate House. Those places reflect the totalitarianism of the 1930s, the decade that produced WWII. The book was written in 1948 (obviously), which was only 3 years after the ending of the war. The fact is that conditions in post-war Britain were almost worse than during the war itself. Austerity was the watchword. Rationing prevailed. Bombsite rubble was everywhere in London. Russia, the former ally, was now the enemy. Orwell was working for the BBC, and he must have developed a sensitivity to the potential ways in which the public could be deceived and manipulated. It didn't take much projecting to imagine how things threatened to develop, especially with the history of the pre-war Communist show-trials and executions, and rantings of Nazi oratory to draw on. All this is very well depicted in the film. The warning of the book was that these things weren't happening in Eurasia (Nazi Germany) or Eastasia (Russia) but in Oceania (US and UK). Airstrip One was the UK re-named: a place for transatlantic bombers to land and take off from. The national anthem was titled: Oceania,'Tis of thee. So Orwell's satire was targeting home territory. The threat of an everchanging enemy meant a way to keep the home population under control. The vision is utterly bleak. However, if the film has a flaw, it is that the visual shabbiness is almost too much. It's just a little over the top: and if the settings had been a fraction less threadbare and brutal, then thoughtcrime and its cure could perhaps have been even more chilling. Difficult to tell. John Hurt --- what a name for the part.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is the best version of Pride and Prejudice ever made. The acting is superb, the diologe wonderful and the ambiance perfect. Jennifer Ehel and Colin Firth make a perfect pair and the rest of the cast is well suited to their parts. Overall, it is a delight to behold.
B000066C1N|5.0|I got this for my kids who loved the Spirit movie. To my surprise, it has become a favorite of mine as well. I race triathlons and the instrumentals thunder in me during my races.  The kids favor the same songs which are actually classical pieces. <br /> <br />My first copy got scratched from overuse so I bought a personal copy that I keep the kids away from. I turn it up loud on the stereo before my races. <br /> <br />The vocals with Brian Adams are wonderful as well. Get this CD and listen a few times. You will be hooked.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|this movie was amazing.  It was definitely a well done movie and really makes you think.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and it defintely fulfilled its purpose as entertainment, which is why I bought it! :)
B00005JPBP|5.0|After the release of the astoundingly good BATMAN BEGINS in 2005, it seemed clear that director Christopher Nolan's next project would be the sequel, so naturally it came as a surprise when he announced that his next project would be something else: an adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel THE PRESTIGE.  Nolan has a history of following up good projects with extraordinary projects (FOLLOWING with MEMENTO, INSOMNIA with BATMAN BEGINS).  As BATMAN BEGINS was an extraordinary project, Nolan was due for a good project.  That's what I was expecting when I saw THE PRESTIGE: a good film.  What I received was far greater than what I expected, because as it turns out, THE PRESTIGE is one of the finest films I have ever seen.    Trying to summarize the film would be a futile effort; the plot thickens immensely with each moment.  The plot in its simplest form is as follows: in London at the end of the 19th century, two young rival magicians (played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) compete to become the finest magicians alive.  Bale seems to accomplish this after performing the ultimate magic trick; Jackman becomes obsessed with finding out Bale's secret and besting him.  By the film's end, its beginning is a distant memory, and one may wonder how we, the viewers, arrived at its end at all.      That's not to say that watching the film is strenuous, though.  Not at all.  Watching THE PRESTIGE is a thoroughly captivating and ultimately haunting experience.  What I am saying is that with a storyline of such depth, the film could fail miserably in the hands of a lesser director.  Fortunately, Christopher Nolan is an immensely talented director, one who is nearly cemented in my mind as one of the finest directors alive today.  He is a young master of filmmaking.  Every shot, every scene, every performance, every moment in THE PRESTIGE is flawless, and that's thanks in no small part to Nolan.    Then there's the sensational cast, headed by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, twovery talented actors who here are at the top of their form.  The on-screen rivalry between the two is delicious, and each character is just flawed enough so you never side with either of them for long.  The excellent supporting cast includes the consistently lovable Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Peter Jackson favorite Andy Serkis, and an unrecognizable David Bowie, as well as Piper Perabo, who has very little screentime.  Surprisingly, Scarlett Johansson feels almost as though she's wasted and possibly being typecast in the role of \\"flaming temptress\\" (see also MATCH POINT).     David Julyan's score is very subtle, but its subtlety actually works extremely well, especially when combined with Wally Pfister's typically murky cinematography.  Lee Smith, who also edited BATMAN BEGINS, has done a similarly fast-paced editing job.  The pace could, at times, throw people off.  At the beginning of the film, I was virtually clueless about what was happening.  Advice to those planning on seeing the film: sit it through and enjoy the ride.  It'll all sort itself out by the end.     A film like THE PRESTIGE could wind up like a failed magic trick: interesting, perhaps, but ultimately silly and a waste of time.  THE PRESTIGE, however, is every bit as astounding as the \\"ultimate magic trick\\" performed within the film.  It's a stellar effort from everyone involved.  The film itself is the most delightful of cinematic magic tricks, the rare film that not only surpasses your expectations, but leaves you speechless.  Personally, I'm surprised that the film hasn't received overwhelmingly positive reviews; in fact, many have even been rather negative.  Maybe with all the cliched dramas and horror remakes that have emerged recently, film audiences are losing their ability to handle a well-made film, even if it is as complex as THE PRESTIGE.  Don't let its complexity put you off from seeing it, though: THE PRESTIGE is not only one of the finest films of the year, it's very probably one ofthe finest films I've ever seen.
B000002A3T|5.0|This album has a great sound to it.  Classic Floyd fans won't find it the same sound as Wish You Were Here, this is more along the lines of Momentary Lapse of Reason, but the songs seem to have slightly older flavor for guitar riffs.  I loved this album and it now has moved up the charts on my Floyd albums.  It rates up there with the great classics as long as you are open minded and not a purist.  Lyrics have more meaning than more recent albums as well, giving it a purpose like Final Cut.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who loved the sound of On the Turning Away, the songs on Division Bell have the same passion and soleful guitar solo's.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|Evanescence has become like listening to the opera.  The piano can be used in rock music, but not in every song on the damn album.  Her voice is all you hear in every song, along with her depressing piano. So if you enjoy the opera or classical music, buy this album. If you want something that rocks, try Hinder.
B000F48CD8|4.0|I think Jack White is one of the most talented musicians out there. This album is another example of his talents. Very retro 70's sound, reminds me of early Led Zeppelin. I would recommened this album
B00006CXSS|5.0|What can I say about this great war movie. This production will take you right into the action. If you are a veteran or just a war buff you will fall into the action of this movie. This movie should be a 10 star movie. <br /> <br />Larry M. <br /> <br />Maryland

Of course, the MCR's DNA is still on their lyrics and chords... Now, I have another CD for the soundtrack of my life... Thank you Guys!!! Release the Bats!!!
B000058983|5.0|When this record came out in 1967, it immediately went on to my top ten list of favorite records. Many changes have been made to that list over the years, but this one has always remained on it. The remastered CD is beautiful.  There were a lot of great records made in the late 60's and early 70's.  Love was a group that did not get a lot of airplay, but deserved to be heard.   If you have never listend to Forever Changes, it is well worth the purchase.  Arthur Lee created one great record.
B000006TRV|4.0|Just now catching up on a lot of the good music/groups I didn't appreciate in my younger life. Pink Floyd is definitely one I've been missing out on. Good music, crisp, clear sound. Only overshadowed, slightly, by Dark Side of the Moon.
0066620996|3.0|Good to great is a fine book for those looking for a secular methodology designed to bring about success over a long period of time.  Collins points out his research team's findings and boils them down to useful nuggets of information.  Some of the resulting information is however pragmatic, and may be subject to revision at a later date.  His concepts of what make companies great may be true for those companies surveyed, but need to applied with caution, because his rational for greatness was something temporal not something timeless.
B00012QM86|5.0|As a World History teacher I highly recommend this video for teaching the Holocaust.  It makes you feel as if you are actually there.  If you are interested in using it as a teaching tool parts maybe chosen to present to students to demonstrate the various aspects of the Holocaust.  I have used it several times in the classroom to demonstrate various points about the Holocaust.  You can show a ten minute selection from the film and then have the student write about their impressions of the clip they just saw.  Personally the video when watched in one setting had a tremendous impact on me - I don't say this about many movies.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|Ok, so Ive been a fan of My Chemical Romance for a few years now, ever since I saw them with Finch and The Used back in early 2003. I bought Three Cheers before MTV sucked it up and spat it out to the masses. And I will admit, it ticked me off that they rose to fame so fast. It didnt bother me with NFG or The Ataris, bands that I had such great respect and admiration for far beyond MCR, and yet I felt repulsed when MCR suddenly had thousands of girly fans screaming for them. I started thinking of excuses to not like them anymore. Im normally not that shallow, but for some reason, it struck me as wrong that they were so famous. <br /> <br />Well, I bought the Black Parade because everyone was raving over it. In a year where Ive hated almost everything released by bands I used to worship (I mean you, Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, Saves The Day and even you, Goo Goo Dolls), I decided to just buy the damn thing and see if it was as good as people were saying. In a word, yes it is. <br /> <br />Gone are all the whiny emo-punk overtones. No whiny ballads about how much life sucks. In fact, theres so much Queen on this album I half expected Freddie Mercury to show up as a ghost. This is one of the few albums this year I can stand the whole way through, thanks to songs like Teenagers, Dead! and Welcome to the Black Parade. Musically, the band has matured wonderfully, playing with more proficiency than Ive heard from them. Layered guitars, dueling riffs and complex breakdowns and bass lines do the band and album much justice. But it retains enough of the old energy that \\"old\\" (read: all those 14 year old girls who are now 16) fans will still eat it up. Not as much speed as before, but it doesnt matter when the songs are this rich and textured.
B000002UAX|5.0|In the period leading up to this album, the Beatles were expanding their <br />range of talent into new realms. The White Album represented a milestone in the groups artistic maturity.
B00005T7I6|5.0|There are films that give me the feeling that the actors were enjoying themselves.  This is one of those films.  It seems like we're watching well paid actors play cops and robbers.<br /><br />Here is a hint of what the movie is like:  Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman give over the top performances, while Dick Van Dyke has one of the lowest key roles.<br /><br />If there is anything negative I'd say about the movie, I would in one word:  Madonna.<br /><br />I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.
B000068FY0|4.0|John Lennon or Paul McCartney? David LeeRoth or Sammy Hagar? Metallica or Megadeth? Britney or Christina? Rick or Roger?  Who's your favorite in rocks big rivalries?  Most are one or the other and in the case of Supertramp composers, I've always leant (with the majority I guess) to Roger.  Roger's songs have that instant likeability to them and while sometimes too grand and diverse, always contain interesting subject matters. Not that I'm trying to be unfair to Rick; I'm sure he has he share of fans and can probably take a lot of credit for input into Roger's songs while they were together. I'm not into Blues music which Rick leaned towards and Rick's voice (some would say the same about Roger's) can be a bit annoying. Some of Rick's songs rank in among my Supertramp favorites, it's just Roger dominates that list. Having said that, I don't own any post-Roger albums so am not qualified to venture any opinion on those years output.. Call me too commercial, too mainstream or whatever, but who (be honest) didn't get into Supertramp after hearing one of Roger's songs?    Onto this album:  Crime was Supertramp's 3rd album and the first with its `classic' lineup. After an interesting debut album in 1970 and a less diverse follow up (sorry but Indelibly Stamped is too Rick, not enough Roger and other than the classic Rosie Had Everything Planned, doesn't offer much) in 1971, Supertramp hit their peak with this album. A sharp rise and a few years at their best until the inevitable decline - which started with the second half of Breakfast In America.    Short (only 8 tracks) in today's terms, Crime is all about substance. While some tracks plod in parts, on the whole Crime is a treat.    School finally gets going with a gentle Roger vocal and builds to an all in piano jam session with Rick lending his vocals near the end. While not up with their absolute best, it's an interesting song and good opener, though Roger's weakest track on the album.  Bloody Well Right is one of Rick's best songs. A gentle piano intros then psychedelic guitar leads into an all in blues rocker.  Hide In Your Shell is one of Supertramp's best. It's gentle, sad, touching and uplifting all in one. A Roger classic.  Asylum is the albums weak point. Overlong considering what content it offers. Had it been half its length it would be better. The screaming `insanos' don't age well. Has its moments but out of place amongst the rest of the songs here.  Dreamer is of course the best known song here. While an awesome track, I've always felt it didn't really go anywhere. It builds nicely but never really takes off. When you think it's about it pulls back. Perhaps that's its charm. Great use of stereo with Roger's vocals answering Rick's.  Rudy is another Rick `classic' but for me it's a bit hit and miss. Sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. Certainly the hard edged ending always does it for me but I've never really gotten into the chorus. The softer parts though are great.  If Everyone Was Listening is a gem that doesn't generally get the recognition it deserves. Classic Roger, it's perhaps though, in too standard a format - quiet, uninspired verse with catchy, anthem-like chorus.  Crime Of The Century (along with From Now On) is Rick's best song. What won me over with this song is the subtle change with the piano at the end. I thought it clever and fell in love with the song - from reverse I guess.    The album maybe would have benefited from the addition of the Roger written Land Ho (which was released as a single the same year), but I guess you couldn't have Land Ho and Dreamer on the same album - given they are so similar.    If you have any of their best of's, you may not need this (as most tracks are found elsewhere) but to complete (or start) your Supertramp collection, don't go past this one.

0930289528|5.0|This summer a friend of mine realized I had never seen the movie \\"V for Vendetta\\" and he insisted that I saw it. I didn't think it looked like my type of movie, but I watched it with him anyway. As I was watching it I was glued to the story line the whole time. I went home and looked up more information on the movie, and realized it was based off of a book, and not just a book, but a comic book.  <br /> <br />I was a little intimidated about buying the book, because I had never read a comic book before, or graphic novel as it is referred too. But I can't love a movie and then not read the book. I started reading it and became just as hooked as I was when I watched the movie. The story was similar, yet very different. I enjoyed reading the extra details that the book included (as most books include while the movie excludes them.) Often I found myself just looking at the art; it is so cool to look at. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this book, especially if you enjoyed the movie. It is defiantly not a kid's comic book, it is a high quality piece of literature.  <br />

0393061310|2.0|I had to read Jared Diamond's Pulitzer prize winning book because of the rave reviews and acclaim. The thoughts that he introduces in the book are certainly interesting and he presents us with a new way to interpret history which is certainly important. However, there is much overkill in making points about the development of each civilization - crops are the major topic with little discussion on guns, germs (more than the other 2), and steel. Of course the arguement for this focus is that the domestication of crops is how civilizations develop guns, germs and steel. I enjoyed parts of the book considerably, but you would have to have a strong interest in horticulture and botany to truely appreciate the book. I guess I was spoiled by first reading his sequel to GGS, \\"Collapse\\" - a terrific read that should be of interest to everyone -it relates our industrialization to every aspect of the environment and show historically how this has shaped history. It has major rammifications for our situation on this earth right now. -RK

B00013RC8O|4.0|This is a must see for thoses of you still searching all these years since the sixties.  Kowalski is the Everyman we strive to become, yet are reluctant to put the petal to the metal and make a commitment to life as it comes our way.  Hats off to the strong supporting cast and genius direction.  We can all identify with somebody here. <br />The only problem I have is neither version presented on the disc coincides with my actual memory of the climactic ending.  In MY mind, Kowalski speeds up, becomes airborne and, yes, VANISHES at the roadblock.  The ending(s) supplied really let me down.

B000002KB8|5.0|In this endless debate about what band was actually the creators of heavy metal, there's one thing that all of these detractors of Sabbath don't understand. Black Sabbath has to be the first heavy metal band, because up until their debut album, there were NONE in existence. Led Zeppelin weren't and never were metal! Nor were Deep Purple, Cream(laughable!!), Hendrix or any other band of this period. Hard rock, maybe, for a couple of them, but metal? No sir. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of all of these, but Sabbath is the only one really deserving the title METAL. Nearly every metal band since Sabbath has been directly influenced by them, all you need to do is take a listen to them and it becomes obvious. People in bands know what they like and they know who their influences are. If 90% of metal bands are citing Black Sabbath as their biggest influence, then you do the math, pal.
B00003CXBK|5.0|\\"Princess\\" is among the absolute best anime to come along, in the last 15 years, and arguable, one of writer/director Hayao Miyazaki's best, as well. The visuals and writing are imaginative, original, realistic. Female characters are predominately featured here as in several other of Miyazaki's films, which I highly recommend (Howls Moving Castle, Spirited Away, Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind).   I feel that his work is art that takes me to that sublime nether world where one can truly see with \\"eyes unclouded by hate, mediocrity, or status quo\\". I screened this movie during lunch breaks, at my job, for co-workers. It was well received by most who couldn't recall seeing anything like it before.

B000I5Y8ZU|4.0|I bought this album on a whim and it turned out to be a very good choice. Before this album I was fairly unacquainted with My Chemical Romance, but they impressed me with this album. <br /> <br />The vocals Way provides are both a strong and a weak point for the album. His voice gives a lot of unique energy and emotion to each song and he seems to have a deep understanding of how to use his voice to convey a deeper meaning past the lyrics. The only problem is that he at times over-processes his voice. Some effects are beneficial to the song (as in \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\") but others sometimes drown his voice more than is entirely necessary. Still, I was impressed by his performance. <br /> <br />His lyrics are bizarre, and at first-listen a little over-the-top. Still, from the beginning you start to catch little spots of brilliance, and by the end they grow on you a great deal. If you can get past the seemingly intentional melodrama, Way's lyrics are actually very deep and interesting. <br /> <br />Overall, I really recommend this album. It is a highly bizarre but wonderful to listen to treat for fans of modern rock. <br /> <br />The guitars on the album are excellent. They play a style that seems a little vintage, and it compliments the album fabulously. The guitar solos are a lot of fun, and a lot of talent is evident.
B000FQ4M58|1.0|I don't know that Bat Out Of Hell needed to be a trilogy.  The original was perfection.  Bombastic.  Wagnerian.  It has been described and analyzed and it still rocks.  Now we've come to this.  Overall, its.....nice.  It has some Steinman cuts....but if you want to hear them done right, check out Pandora's Box 'Original Sin'. Then you'll understand why these versions pale. <br /> <br />Steinman is the true star....his songs need only the right voice and production.  You won't find that here.  I'll always be a Meatloaf fan....too bad he didn't show up for this.
0446528056|3.0|As Nicholas Sparks begins his book by saying 'there is a beginning, middle and end to this story' that's about the way this book goes downhill.  I looooved the beginning.  It's a great love story and it swept me up.  But then, like almost all Nicholas Sparks, it takes a depressing turn (if not a tad boring.)  I read this book in two days, flipping pages, hoping things would look up but, alas, it never did.  Like another reviewer said, we're ready for a HAPPY ending.  There's something about reading a depressing book that just leaves you depressed.  Also, if there is a record for how many times an author can use the word 'portending', Nicholas Sparks has broke the record.  It seems it was turning up on every other page.  All in all, read it or leave it.
006441034X|4.0|I watched the movie before reading the book.  This gave me a idea of what the characters looked like, and sounded like while reading the book.  The book though is very different than the movie.  The movie was geared towards children, whereas the book is more teen to adult.
B00005JPB4|4.0|In the beginning, I thought I might have a deja-vu with \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" & \\"Band of Brothers\\" with its stone-washed colour look & epic battle scene.  Some actors were in those previous movies too.  For interested parties that sat through the end credit, you would note that Steven Spielberg & Clint Eastwood are executive producers and thus, the resemblance.  Other than the \\"look\\", this movie is a far more complex movie tackling upon the public in search of pagan \\"heroes\\" to worship; racial discrimination (Adam Beach acted splendidly and to me anyway, the  the core emotional soul of this offering, & he was in John Woo's World War 2's Windbreakers); the war not being as clearcut as we imagine it to be, questioning if soldiers fight for their country, an idealogy, &/or for the buddies next to them; dissecting the \\"(in)famous photo itself & shedding light to the hypocrisy & the conspiracy of the whole incident.  It's wise to sit through the end credits as there were more actual photos of Iwo Jima to browse through.  Clint Eastwood goes from strength to strength and his trademark seems to be getting the viewers to draw conclusion for themselves.  A movie that would linger on in your mind for a very long time.  Highly recommended.
B000J10ERO|4.0|PREFACE: Another chapter in the Superman series. This latest one takes plays a few years after Clark's mysterious disappearance. It is revealed that he left to find out more about himself, and when he returned, he really found more out about everyone else, and what they have been doing while he was away.<br /><br />CAST/CHARACTERS:<br /><br />Clark Kent (Superman) - Superman Returns has a huge budget cast to go along with its huge budget visuals. Newcomer Brandon Routh is the exception. This 6'4\\" actor is new to the bizz, and was mostly chosen based on his similar appearance to the original Superman actor, Christopher Reeve. His performace was surprisingly good, and don't be surprised if you start seeing him in more movies. He was successfully able to show the depths of Clark and Superman's double-life, as well as the complexity of choosing to save life.<br /><br />Lex Luthor - In the movie, Lex Luthor, played by Kevin Spacey, is the nemesis. With his God-complex, brilliant mind, scrude languange, and access to valuable resources, he is a very formidable adversary. Spacey does a brilliant job at playing the madman, and is probably the best acted in the film.<br /><br />Lois Lane - Kate Bosworth as a brunette? Yes, that's right! Bosworth plays the family-oriented Lois in this Superman. Having now popped out a pup, she has more to risk in this film. Having a previous love interest with Superman, this creates more tension between Lois, Clark, and Lois' new man, Richard. She is probably the most complex character because she has to deal with being the family-mom, the working-mom, and the clever journalist which won her a Pulitzer. Bosworth's acting was fair, but considering the difficulty of her character, I was impressed to that degree.<br /><br />Richard White - He creates a lot of friction. He is severly in love with Lois, who he's engaged to and doesn't seem thrilled, has to compete with Superman for the love of his life, and is trying to play father, unsuccessfully to Lois' child. He often gives Lois ultimatums, to which she does not appreciate, and he's really not that appealing of a character. Personally, I think he should've just kept doing X-Men 3, and not have been killed off; Cyclops suits him much better.<br /><br />All the other characters were minor with no real complexities or explination, and really won't be discussed. There are other great actors in this film though, including: Eva Marie Saint, Kal Penn, and a man that's no stranger to Superman films and shows, Jack Larson.<br /><br />SYNOPSIS: Superman returns after finding nothing from the remains of his Planet Krypton. When he gets there, he finds his whole world turned upside down. All the people he cared about had moved on, and one of his greatest foes was released from prison because of Superman's absence in trial. Luthor marries a terminally ill woman to get her fortune after her passing, and succeed in gaining wealth. He also went on a quest to find Superman's \\"Fortress of Solitude.\\" When he got there, he discovered crystals that could create land mass. Because of his God-complex, he wanted to be able to do just that. The only thing that can stop him is Superman, but after stealing a large Kryptonite rock from a museum, Superman might not be a problem after all.<br /><br />SCRIPT/DIRECTING: The film was very well executed. For an high-budget action flick, the script was very well put together, as well as very well executed. Bryan Singer, famous for the first two X-Men movies and The Usual Suspects, used his 2nd largest movie budget of all time to his advantage, creating breathtaking cinematics, and huge sets. The movie builds up and has a great climax, as well as amazing fight scenes. He makes Superman's flying look realistic and fluid, and uses many great camera views and filters to make a very beautiful film. Not up to par with The Usual Suspects, but for the type of movie it is, Superman Returns was a great addition to his resume.<br /><br />DVD: I haveseen the actual DVD version of the film on 720P resolution, but have not been given a chance to see the extras. The film is also in great Dolby 5.1 Surround, making you feel the action. From reading the extras, I can see that there a \\"Making Of...\\" and cast interviews, all of which should be interesting to see, considering the movie had a $270 million budget; you gotta wonder where all that money went, right?<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Nothing incredibly new for fans to see, and no Oscars being won, but this fun action film will take you for quite a ride. An adrenaline that really does put the \\"Super\\" in Superman.DVD version of the film on 720P resolution, but have not been given a chance to see the extras.

1932100660|5.0|Dr. Campbell lays out a great deal of information on diet and nutrition and their relationship with disease and health, making it clear that we should be eating unprocessed plant foods and why.  He also goes to some length to shed light on why and how we've been fed so much disinformation by the dairy, meat, and drug cartells in America, and how they're keeping us fat and sick on their bad food, while profiting from the drugs that they sell us to \\"make us better\\".  The strongest aspects of Colin's book are 1) the depth and duration of The China Study itself and 2) that he cites numerous studies to support his conclusions, and 3) his extensive credentials, exposure to the health machine and experience.
0783116934|5.0|If you like Donald Sutherland, this is one of his greatest movies of all time. This is a movie that you will be able to watch over and over again.
B00000DC10|5.0|Wow. To be honest, I'm late to the whole Refused bug. \\"The Shape of Punk to Come\\" may have been from 1998, but I was not interested in this type of music at the time and didn't even know they existed for another 2-3 years. And from then, the things I heard about them were all positive. And then I was getting into (post)-hardcore, which was where my interest began. I listened to \\"New Noise\\" because I heard it was their \\"classic\\" tune. I didn't even acquire it until a couple months ago(!) <br /> <br />That being said, I am impressed. The album title is 100% apt, and it's rare for this to happen in punk. While many artists may sing about anti-conformity, several of the bands in the ilk sound similar, and then adding a guitar solo will sometimes be used to make the songs actually stand out. But Refused are a totally different kind of breed. They are kind of like Fugazi, they are punk rockers but they've got all the integrity and creativity that's beyond what some may predict it to be. <br /> <br />Out of all 12 of these songs, not one of these is weak. The awesome electronic instrumental \\"Brutist Pome #5\\" is even a highlight on here. The tracks flow in amazingly well and the whole thing was well-written. There is mostly yelling on the album, however, this is not too much of a bad thing, as Dennis also speaks and at times actually will sing, like on the excellent \\"Summerholidays vs. Punkroutine,\\" a track about the idea of maybe going big. It contains the album's greatest line: \\"rather be forgotten than remembered for giving in,\\" which in itself should've been seen as a kind of anthem. <br /> <br />Things kick off with speaking, and while it says how classics go out of style, I don't think this will ever be \\"out of style\\" for the underground. The lyrics on that track, \\"Worms of the Senses/Faculties of the Skull,\\" are clearly anti-capitalist, and even though I am not really the most politically-minded, the lyrics are intellegent and that's what drives me to it. NOFX are boring compared to these guys, even if these guys aren't as humorous or anything. At the end of the track there is a \\"radio station\\" coming in with this \\"futuristic\\" electronic music in the background. That fades out and then you get into \\"Liberation Frequency,\\" a track that is addictive on here. And throughout, there are ohter interesting moments, like the awesome rhythm section highlighted on the jazzy \\"Deadly Rhythm,\\" the marching drums of \\"Protest Song '69,\\" and better yet, the killer riff and memorable tune of my personal favorite, \\"Refused Are F***ing Dead.\\" Later in the album there's even a bit of orchestral instruments, which is interesting to hear in this sort of album. It is musically interesting, and I wonder what took me so long to get this. <br /> <br />This chimerical bombination is something I confidentally call a favorite of mine, even though I haven't even owned it that long. It inspired me recently to buy \\"The EP Compilation\\" which I saw at a store (!) and I loved that one, too. I may even try out some (International) Noise Conspiracy. This is an album in which the greatness is the least questionable thing.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time--having it on DVD so I can select a scene just makes it better.  The only complaint I have is that there are no subtitles available (at far as I can tell)--otherwise it's great--a faithful rendition of a classic story.  I think Jane Austen would be pleased.
B000000W6F|5.0|I think it would be safe to say that Gish is Smashing Pumpkins' best album. I love listening to every one of the songs on here, except maybe Day Dream, which is kind of a weird song, but it's still listenable. Some of their best songs are on here, and the melody lines are great. The guitarwork is so amazing. I don't care if you don't like The Smashing Pumpkins, get this album anyways.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|The Sound and lights are nothing short of spectacular. David Gilmour is at his usual Best, as is the rest of his great bandmates. If you've ever had the VHS copy of this Concert then get ready for the next great step in Video!  This will blow your mind,especially if you have a nice home theater System. You will not regret buying this DVD set!
B000000WA4|5.0|With 2 discs full of songs, this album comes with their best, but also possibly their worst songs as well. But the worst songs are still listenable, and with 28 songs, it's very much a great album, especially for the price. Definitely get this album.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|There are 14 tracks on this CD with Diane Warren contributing one \\"Cry Over Me\\" and Desmond Child with six, but not surprisingly it's the seven tracks by Jim Steinman that brings out the thunder and passion in Meat Loaf. While Mr Child is the bright student to Mr Steinmans' teacher, and while his songs are Steinman-like they are not Steinman but Desmond Child really shines on \\"What About Love\\" thanks to Meat Loafs performance. <br /> <br />But it's the songs of Jim Steinman that elevate the CD to near-greatness...I say near-greatness because the original Bat Out Of Hell set the standard so high that it is impossible to surpass it. One of the numbers \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" is simply amazing.  It's one of those songs you have to push the repeat button and listen to again and again.  \\"Seize the Night\\" is one of those Jim Steinman/Meat Loaf mini gothic operas and gothic is right since it comes from Jim Steinmans Broadway musical \\"Dance Of The Vampires\\". <br /> <br />So this CD overall is very good but when Meat Loaf sinks his teeth into the songs of Jim Steinman  it soars. <br /> <br />
B000000W6R|3.0|I'll just say it's not their best album, but it's still good, as it is still Smashing Pumpkins after all. However, any fan of SP should still get this album.
B0000025H0|1.0|This album was released in 1979.  It is 44 minutes long and there are no liner notes.  It was Santana's worst selling album of all time (it did worse than Santana's forays into jazz). <br /> <br />There are only 2 tracks on this CD that are any good, and they are both instrumentals.  Aqua Marine may be the prettiest composition that Santana has ever done.  Runnin' is a short, driving instrumental tacked on to Stand Up. <br /> <br />The rest of the CD is soul/pop.  I like pop.  I like soul.  I like Santana playing pop and soul.  This CD is just bad pop/soul.   <br /> <br />Part of the problem is the new lead singer, Alex Ligertwood, who sings all the vocals.  He has a bad, in your face, over the top style.  He will be a bane for Santana for years to come.   <br /> <br />After 3 smash Latin-rock albums, Santana migrated to jazz fusion.  In the later seventies, he started moving back to his Latin-rock roots.  But then he overshot and started doing pop with a Latin tinge.  And tried moving into soul.  From the late seventies and all through the eighties, Santana had a stripped down pop sound.  He started getting it back together in the nineties.  However, no matter what he was into, Santana always put on a great concert.
B0001I55NS|4.0|The book is better than the movie but I like this genre so I gave it a try. Glad I did.
B000BNI90O|5.0|The DVD audio recording is suberb. The listener is removed from his listening station and transported to the musical environment of The Fellowship of the Ring. Excellent experience.
B000G759LW|4.0|She is one of the most greatest young singers I have heard lately. Her voice is soulful and she can sing with such emotion. She is incredible. She is currently out on tour, catch her if you can.
B000F7CMRM|1.0|Me and a female friend went and watched this one in the theater. I ... was ... bored ... out ... of ... my ... skull. After about a half hour my friend, who tends to be more \\"progressive\\" than I, actually suggested we leave. It was the first time either of us have ever left while the movie was playing. Ever! <br /> <br />Perhaps I'm biased. However I highly recommend that no one get this movie. The only reason I can think that anyone would give it a good rating is because of its political slant. I tend to lean to the right, but even I was entertained by V For Vendetta, despite it being blatant liberal propaganda. If you are going to pontificate about how we conservatives are evil, at least make it interesting.
0440241413|4.0|I'm sure everyone knows someone like this person. It was an easy read, but I did expect it to be a much funnier read. Still prefer: Can you keep a secret? or Bridget Jones' Diary series. If you want a light, easy read and some humor at times this is a good book for you.
0060254920|5.0|My children adored this book, and my grandbabies do as well.  It's particularly good for the 3 to 6 age group. It has everything--monsters, imagination, small boys.  A classic.
0446528056|5.0|John Tyree grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina raised by a single dad whose wife dumped the two males in her life.  However, John learns from his father's Asperger's syndrome and his mother's abandonment that relationships must remain short, one night stands being his modus operendi except for joining the army wherehe makes a lifetime commitment as an infantryman.<br /><br />When John was twenty-three and on leave he meets University of North Carolina special education major Savannah Lynn Curtis at Wrightsville Beach.  They are attracted to one another though he is a social pariah and she volunteers her time for all types of social causes.  They have nothing in common, but fall in love.  John plans to leave the service once his enlistment is up so he can marry his beloved and raise a family with her; Savannah Lynn vows to wait for her Dear John.  However, 9/11 changes the dynamics as he chooses country over love by reenlisting; she must decide between waiting and sending a \\"Dear John\\" letter by choosing a wannabe suitor, her long time friend Tim.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks is at his best with this deep bittersweet look at relationships that enables the audience to see what a real sacrifice in support of the war against terrorism is as compared to the fake political speeches that claim all American's are sacrificing.  Readers will like John, Savannah Lynn, and Tim as these are caring people trying to do their best, but know someone will be hurt.  Mr. Sparks is at is best with this powerful complex drama of love vs. patriotism.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B000000Y27|5.0|Reminds me of those late, after-hour joints in Chicago when I was living a happy, smokey jazz lush life in that great city.  It's three in the morning, the music jumps, every foot is tapping to his sweet, solid sound and I'm young again. And what a great time Wes and his fellows are having -- Tommy Flanagan on piano, Percy Heath bass and Albert Heath on drums.  A perfect mix of exceptional talent and chemistry. For you newcomers, pay attention -- this is music!
B000002UAI|5.0|Excellent. A must for any Beatle lover. One of the earliest recordings as they were on their way to be the greatest band of all time.
B000000XCA|3.0|Okay, this record at least gets off to a great start: the rockin' slice of self-mythology Born on the Bayou and the underrated Bootleg. Then it takes a complete u-turn, with the murky, meandering, uninteresting jam Graveyard Train. And it remains in that u-turn, first on a dull cover of Little Richard's Good Golly, Miss Molly, then with the equally forgettable Penthouse Pauper. Proud Mary (most certainly the best thing on this disc) comes along and saves the day, but it's only temporary - things close with an even less interesting jam, Keep on Chooglin'. At least Graveyard Train has interesting lyrics...<br /><br />But there are some upsides. The aforementioned Proud Mary cooks, a merger of soul, gospel, rock and country. And who could forget the \\"World, keep on turnin'/Proud Mary keep on burnin'/Rollin', rollin', rollin' down the river\\" refrain? Not me, that's for sure. Born on the Bayou is another one of the centerpiece tracks and most certainly their best song not to be released as a single. And Bootleg is their best album track, a lost little gem that's actually worth buying the album for. It's uneven, but the three good tracks make it worth a look.
B000G75AE8|5.0|What i am supposed to say about this thrash metal masterpiece....I think that the only thing I can say is that Dave Lombardo's return made Slayer the band we all knew before many years...Nothing more....Buy and let your EARS BLEED!!!!!!! PURE F****'N SLAYER!!!!!!!!! HAIL!!!!!!
B000000XCD|5.0|Let's face it, John Fogerty was NOT in a good mood when CCR recorded Green River. No matter what the idyllic title track may lead to believe, this is an enraged, paranoid, defeated record. Not only that, it's an excellent engraged, paranoid, defeated record, loaded with some of the group's best hits. I'd go with the best song being the natural-disaster warning Bad Moon Rising (which, contrary to popular belief, had NOTHING to do with bathrooms on the right). Not to discount the other songs, though. The title track is a favorite of mine, and as I said one of the few songs this disc that's not angry. Even then, it's melancholy. Same with Lodi, a song about a musician payin' dues. Commotion is another warning song, and it's also first-rate. Plus we get a couple of the group's best album tracks: Tombstone Shadow and especially Wrote a Song for Everyone, the latter being my second-favorite on the disc. The album does fall apart on a couple tracks, though: Cross-Tie Walker is at the level of some of Bayou Country's fillers; Night Time is the Right Time throws off the mood and showcases awful faux doo-wap backing vocals that must be heard to be believed. But whatever - this is still CCR's best.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|Clasic Enya.  If you have enjoyed her other albums you will enjoy this one also if not more.  Great sound and a CD you will want to listen to over and over..  I have the CD riped and on my Ipod so I can listen to it on short plane flights.  Makes for great relaxation time.
B000AADYYO|5.0|As I write my review for this CD there are almost two hundred prior five star reviews! Well I am going to be the next person to give this amazing and beautiful CD a five star rating. That's right, I used the word beautiful to describe a \\"Death Metal\\" CD, but more about that later. And if you give this CD the time it deserves you too will almost certainly conclude that this is a five star recording.<br />Now, while Opeth's music is generally categorized as \\"Death Metal\\", Opeth cannot be pigeonholed into this genre of music. Opeth is much, much more than that, spanning many genres and almost requiring a category of their own. And the growling vocals are really the only thing that would even categorize Opeth as Death Metal anyway. Furthermore, on this CD there is just as much 'regular' singing as there is growling vocals. Now, while seasoned Death Metal fans are not going to have a problem with the growling vocals, those who are not fans of or have never heard this type of vocals will almost certainly dismiss this CD without a second thought. And that is a real shame because the growling vocals loose their shock value quickly, and then you realize the vocals actually fit the music well, and at this point may begin to grow on you. Then once you learn to like or at least accept the vocals you will then be left with the realization that the music, which is most important anyway, is simply incredible and at times nothing short of stunning. Now I will concede that if you are a fan of Easy Listening the leap to listening to Opeth would be huge and would likely never happen, however if you are a fan of Hard Rock and Metal the leap to listening to Opeth is really quite small. Take the leap! In my opinion the many CD's of Opeth are certainly some of the best composed, arranged and skillfully executed \\"Metal\\" CD's ever recorded.
0441172717|5.0|I have always shied away from Science Fiction.  I don't know what it is about it, but it has never appealed to me.  To illustrate: a friend of mine bought me this book four years ago with the promise that it would be worth my while and I have only recently read it.<br /><br />If DUNE is a good representation of Science Fiction, then I have been missing out.  What a great book.  I always hesitate to voice my opinion on books that are time tested.  I mean, do you really need someone to tell you that the LORD OF THE RINGS are good books.  Still, if you, like me, eschew Science Fiction for fantasy or other fare, then hopefully my review will persuade you.<br /><br />I enjoyed the technique the author used of dropping the reader into a new world together with the protagonist.  We learn as he does.  This keeps the pace of the book brisk.  Other authors have employed this technique less effectively.<br /><br />The world - Dune - is original and intriguing.  The originality of the book is probably its greatest selling point.  I have not seen, or imagined this type of world (apart from the obvious homage in Beetlejuice).<br /><br />I thought that the development of characters - both as to the insight into their character and their acquisition of skills and powers - was also a great contributor to my enjoyment of the book.  One gets a good feel for the motivation and reasoning behind all of the characters actions, be they prominent or not.  Also, the book does not waste a great deal of time developing the protagonist.  His progression as a powerful figure progresses quickly.  This I think lends itself to better story telling.<br /><br />My experience with many fantasy books is that the development of super-powers IS the story.  Once the protagonist has developed the powers, then the final conflict is brief and ultimately unsatisfying.  Here, there is a story to be told after the pieces are in place, so to speak.  It works.<br /><br />In all, I think that whether you're a fan or Science Fiction or not, you will enjoy DUNE.  I whole-heartedly recommend it.  It has inspired me to read ENDER'S GAME.  Another Sci-Fi book I've put off for years.  I'll report back to you on my impressions of it here.whether you're a fan or Science Fiction or not, you will enjoy DUNE.

B00005YU1O|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, I consider it brain food.  Very interesting to watch because it combines philosophical ideals with artistic capabilities.  One must be in the mood to watch this because if you don't pay attention you could miss an important or just interesting fact/thought.
0451191153|5.0|I found this book great because it basically shows how and why one should value its own life. All through the book she tries to make us understand through the different characters that one should only use their own mind to judge things, never to subordinate their mind to others. She explains that humans being most important characteristic is thinking. If one does not think, he is a living dead. We see in the book what happens to the ones that don't think, who are not rational, logic. I have met both categories of people she depicts. Reading the book made me understand my mistakes, and also made me value my work more and by doing that value myself more. She believes that the highest purpose of a man should be his achievement. I highly recommend this book.
B00004U2GH|5.0|This is, in my opinion, one of best Johnny Cash albums out there. If you were going to own only one Cash album, this should be it. The tracks give you a nice variety of his writing and playing style. It has never before released songs,  a little of Johnny's commentary with some witty remarks and even June Carter and family singing. I thought Folsom Prison was great so I was a little skeptical about San Quentin living up to it. Sure enough, it did and then some!
B00092ZL80|5.0|This is one of the best music videos I have ever seen.  I always loved Chicago and, until this video, I didn't realize what a great group Earth Wind and Fire were.  After viewing this video, we were able to see Earth Wind and Fire in concert and they were \\"fantastic.\\"

0743270754|5.0|Doris Kearns Goodwin has written a splendid and extraordinarily insightful historical study into the life and relationships of President Lincoln and his diverse and at times, adversarial Cabinet.  Writing with a keen senses and understanding on the differences of these men, the reader TRULY is given the information required regarding what Lincoln faced during his time in office in order to appreciate the magnitude of how he held this nation together while eventually politically embracing the notion that freedom for all men was the only way to keep the Union together.<br /><br />The approach of studying the Cabinet and their interactions with Lincoln makes 'Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln'<br /><br />by Doris Kearns Goodwin a standout and complete book on Lincoln's Presidential Administration.  Goodwin writes with such an easy and elegant style that readers will become absorbed quickly with this fascinating story.  A significant bonus in Goodwin's prose is that the reader becomes more involved with the politics of the day by understanding the intent and motives of Lincoln's key administrative team members. From Chase to Steward to Stanton and a whole host of other players, I was riveted! Highly recommended.

B00005JO9J|5.0|There hasn't been a TV series since the 70's that I would be willing to watch over and over again ... till Grey's Anatomy came along.  The characters are diverse, complicated, and very human.  The pressures of being medical \\"newbies\\" added to the dilemmas created by new friendships and new loves brings out the best and worst in these people.  The writing is excellent, the acting believable.  Some of the medical scenarios are a little far-fetched, but it's TELEVISION!  Bottom line: very entertaining.  If you haven't watched \\"Grey's Anatomy\\", I suggest you give it a try.  If you're already hooked, get Season One and enjoy it again.  The extras (dropped scenes, comments by actors, directors and the writer/creator) are icing on a very tasty cake.
B000E6UK5K|1.0|This CD just goes to prove how great of an influence David was on Pink Floyd's music. Out of the box this album is layed back an colored with many subtle textures, it's mellow ambience transports you to dreamy mindscapes. I found the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.
B00006AVRK|5.0|This is one of the few sets that I have ever 'pined' for!  Bertie and the smooth, wry, indomitable Jeeves will ALWAYS be this good!!  The first two dvds are a tad slow and uneven; as they stumbled a bit; finally finding the perfect cast and proceeding to produce some of the very best British comedy/satire around.  And what a wonderful author Wodehouse is.
B000FA57RG|5.0|It is amazing to find this live CD with the I m goint to tell you a secret DVD. Her performances are great! And her dancers...WAO!
B0000TB050|5.0|This simply is a brilliant show. The opening song is explosive and the tempo of the show gracefully shifts throughout the evening. It is a visual treat to have the band members clearly presented as they practice their craft. If you like U2's music even marginally, I believe you will be happy to have this recording.
B000089RVR|5.0|The FIRST Album by Dido that I own. For me a very personal and inmate album with a sensitivty of thought and feeling: perhaps akin to a period in my life. I listened carefully to the lyrics as much as the music. This is very sophisticated for a pop album. Cleaver is not the word to use for the song writing. This is more than cleaver. The lyrics and the music will hold a class beyond time. Its an album I go back to time and again...a MUST BUY.
B000F3A7LE|4.0|Solid and often overlooked work from Fripp. The remixed version is not so vastly different from the original to support reissuance, but is worth a listen for hard core KC and Frippmaniacs, only. Philly Soul meets Frippertronics.
B00006AW2G|4.0|Nothing like the Stones.  They are at their best on this album.  However  as with all their albums the prodution values suck.  But still it is a powerful blast from the past.  well worth the money.
B000FSME1A|5.0|I had read other reviews denouncing the dvd. Among the major complaints was that both the original Apocalypse Now, released in 1979 and Redux released several years ago, have a break midway between both movies.  Thus, a second dvd has to be inserted to continue watching whichever feature you are watching.  Many reviewers hated this about this dvd giving it a low rating as a result.  What I did was utilize the special features in between watching part 1 & part 2 of Apocalypse Now Redux and it made my viewing of the movie much more enjoyable.  Some of the features include a documentary on how Apocalypse Now was originally edited and then reedited to make Apocalypse Now Redux.  That was my favorite documentary from all the special features included which also included interviews with many of the actors including Lawrence Fishburne on his experience making Apocalypse Now.  One feature other reviewers mentioned would have been nice to add to this disc, however, and that is the documentary on Apocalypse Now entitled Hearts of Darkness which would have been great to add to this disc but sadly has not been added.  The dvd does have some great things in it, though, including Francis Ford Coppola's commentary on the making of the movie including how the famous beginning sequence was discovered, almost by accident, and if Francis had not investigated the cut footage, he would never have seen the footage which ultimately became the opening sequence of Apocalypse Now.  This is a dvd definitely worth watching if you are a fan of Apocalypse Now as I am, and certainly worth owning.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|Excellent movie; historical update about Ukraine and its people. Story of redemption and forgiveness; understanding.
0440217563|2.0|I liked the first book in this series, really enjoyed the second book, but I had a really hard time getting through \\"Voyager\\".  There were way too many mini-stories in this novel, way too many characters, and a lot of the story didn't sit well with me at all.  I enjoyed the beginning (that's where the 2 stars come from), which was set in the 1960s, but the book dragged on and on and on.  I thought I would never get through it.  I'm afraid that this one may have convinced me not to continue through the series.
B0000039QA|4.0|The Notorious B.I.G. nor 2Pac were the greatest of all time; not even close. Who's better than B.I.G. and 'Pac? GZA, Nas, AZ, Ghostface, Big L, Big Pun, Immortal Technique, Redman, Method Man, Keith Murray, Canibus - the list goes on. B.I.G. and 'Pac are so overrated, it's not even funny; if they were alive today, B.I.G. would be just as criticized as Jay-Z, and 2Pac would be just as washed-up as Snoop Dogg. Yet you people can't see through this, and choose to worship them because they were martyrs in the game.    Since stating that, I feel the need to say that doesn't mean I dislike either B.I.G. or 'Pac, nor discredit them as emcees. I just don't see them as the Gods that some people, who know very little about hip-hop beyond the 50 Cents and Kanye Wests of the world, proclaim they are. As an overall emcee, B.I.G. was also the better of the two; lyrically, 2Pac's simple rhyme-scheme fails miserabley in comparison to B.I.G.'s complexity, and great word play. 2Pac's passionate delivery made up for this, but B.I.G. even admittedly had a better, more traditional flow. B.I.G. also had a much more vivid imagination, and intricate way with stories. His production was also much finer, and balanced than 2Pac's almost strictly G-Funk trunk rattlers.    I know I'm going to get numerous \\"not helpful\\" votes for pronouncing that neither B.I.G. or 'Pac earned the legacy they were given in their post-mortem life, but I'm giving you nothing more than the truth in this review, and can't help but point out the facts, especially with all the 2Pac ****-riders inhabiting this product, carrying out a beef they were NOT around to even experience, mostly due to their 13-15 year old age range.    With that said, this was a great release, and one of my favorite albums to come out of the mafioso genre; unfortunately, there's far too much filler to call this the classic so many others make it out to be. It may not be as raw as Ready To Die, but that works in its favor more than it takes awayfrom it; this was a much more mature, and vibrant production musically and lyrically than its predecessor. Maybe the rich cinematic scheme is a little too much for people who think \\"Ambitionz Az A Ridah\\" is the greatest hip-hop track of all-time, and all albums should carry that Thug Life tradition, but for true hip-hop heads, the theme carried out in this album is a real treat.     \\"Kick In The Door,\\" \\"Hypnotize,\\" \\"Last Day,\\" \\"What's Beef,\\" \\"Notorious Thugs,\\" \\"Going Back to Cali,\\" \\"My Downfall,\\" \\"Long Kiss Goodnight,\\" and \\"You're Nobody(Till Somebody Kills You)\\" are undoubtedly certified hip-hop classics. The rest of the album, sadly, is filled with good tracks, and filler, and that's why this album is not five stars in my opinion. If you cut off the fat from this prime piece of sirloin, you have an undeniable classic; if you leave it on, you've got about a dozen classic tracks surrounded by another dozen 'meh' tracks.    In the end, this is a grand album, but the double disc idea was too ambitious for B.I.G. at this stage in his career. It's definitely a much better product than his rival's All Eyez On Me(which had fewer classic tracks, and much more filler - as well as lacking any one theme throughout, and simply being thrown together), but it still isn't a top ten, let alone top five album from the illustrious genre of hip-hop. It's recommended, just know what you're getting before hand.

B00005JKQZ|4.0|This movie \\"A Beautiful Mind\\" can show the viewers what schizophrenia under psychosis is like - how serious the psychotic person's case is. More serious than other psychotic patients, like digging out his arm. His wife importantly explained to him how to differentiate between reality and schizophrenia's false visions and false voices. <br /> <br />I find this movie interesting that there are such people who are down with psychosis or schizophrenia, can be geniuses and even can be back to sane mind. <br /> <br />This movie was produced by the directors of the movies who may never have experienced psychosis or schizophrenia so they produced such movies in their own understanding level, not psychotic experiences.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|This cd did not grab me by the neck on my first listen. It is a departure from what Dream Theater has been doing in the recent past, particularily Train of Thought. It is a return to a more lyrical writing, remember Images and Words, which threw me at first. After listening to it again the compositional craft, for which these guys are famous, revealed itself and a lot of good music with it. I would recommend this cd to add to your collection.
1582405956|5.0|Frank Cho is a master.  Some might only look at has work as a group of \\"pretty pictures of pretty women\\", but it is much more than that.  This book gives you a good look at Frank's finished work and some of his sketches.  He is a master at drawing the female form.<br /><br />If you are an artist, you'll be able to appreciate his understanding of anatomy.  His drawings use unique proportions (especially in the hips and legs).  The surface anatomy correctly indicates the structure beneath it.  The way he draws a knee amazes me.  No, I'm not a sicko.  Knees are amoung the most neglected and most difficult body parts to draw.  The simple joint has a number of tendons, bones, and muscles that continually shift based on the angle and distribution of weight.<br /><br />This is a glorious example of a master's work.  I give it my highest rating and can't wait for his next book to come out.
0380730367|4.0|Lehane is a master of his genre and this offering is one of his best.  The story moves with riptide speed, and each page brings new surprises and plot twists.  Lehane is good because he goes the extra mile to spin for his readers a yarn that keeps them reading and doesn't insult their intelligence -- at least most of the time.  Bubba, for example, is a caricature and totally unbelieveable but what the heck, Lehane couldn't resolve some of the plot situations without a guy like Bubba.  A plot so rich and full could easily spin out of control but Lehane is a journeyman and keeps things focused.  That's why I like him and intend to read all his books.

0446530573|5.0|If you are a Sopranos fan and love Italian food, then you must get this book.  It is very entertaining, colorful, and written like you were getting a tour of not only \\"the neighborhood\\", but the personal kitchens of each character depicted.  Salute!
1401302378|5.0|THE LONG TAIL  should be required reading for anyone contemplating selling something in today's marketplace - either online or through traditional venues.  Chris Anderson clearly demonstrates how the internet is transforming purchases - and opening up new opportunities especially for low volume niche marketing. This book is especially helpful for those marketing in the 'entertainment' market - books, music, films etc.
B000009HF2|5.0|Just simply the most outstanding album of all time.  Sounds as great as when I was a 14 year old, now my kids are fans of Frampton. You MUST have this album for your collection.
B00005JPBJ|4.0|As suggested by a previous reviewer I read all the reviews that I could find and I dug and investigated the reviewers as to have a better understanding of how they saw what they wrote about and all I have to say to that one person is.....U have got to lighten up!  Some movies are made to be savored, to be chewed and their many layers digested over a long thought process...this is a horror movie, be it a smart one, but a horror flick non the less.  It delivers on the Saw franchise with plenty of blood and guts and icky things, it wraps up the story line (all 3 movies make one nice story), fills in the holes and does what horror movies are meant to do, entertains while not making our brains work.  I hope (be it in vein) that Hollywood will lay Jigsaw to rest now, he has come full circle without becoming a running joke as his predecessors Jason, Freddy, and Mike did  and we are satisfied.  If left alone the Saws will stand on the higher end of their perspective genre for people who want a little more than slash and flash but not quiet the intensity of the Thing.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|It breaks it down for the unaware and those who have been brainwashed. But it does nothing for the Bush and Limbaugh lovers who will beleive the 1% of 'experts' who probably got their degree [...] It's hilarious how the these 1%'experts' are cited over and over again when none of their 'expert' research has ever been published in a serious scientific journal or review. They keep spewing out crap, hoping no one will call them on it.    For example, someone posted earlier about how our volcanoes spew out more CO2 than all of our cars combined. Yea ok, I think this person spew out more bs than volcanoes. If he 'checked' the facts, which takes like 3 seconds, instead of swallowing everything Limbaugh tells him, he would've soon figured out that man made CO2 per year is more than 150 times that of volcanoes. And that was by 1991 estimate. Today it is at least 10 times that. 2006 and 2005 has the highest ever recorded CO2 level in over hundreds of thousands of years. These findings are done NOT by GORE, (and who really cares who is doing the talking if it is TRUE??)but by dedicated scientists who teach at major universities and publish reports in scietinfic journals - it's like the medical journal for doctors. These journals are highly technical, thourough researched and vetted, the findings MUST be verifiable and it must pass the scrutiny of professional peers in the field. Our country has the best universities in the world and there is a REASON for that. Out of thousands of scientific papers written on the subject by top research universitie on global warming, NONE, ZERO disagree with the disastrous effects of man made CO2 on global warming.    Yet these ignorant people, thinking they are 'smarter' than scientists with PhDs, dismiss them with such casual air, as if that's the only way they can make themselves stand out or be more important than them. God, how low people would go for their egos.    They rather listen to 'expert' idiots like themselves who often work forMobile & Exxon, who knows nothing about the real science and will say anything for $$$$, they are the true science fiction writers, like the guy that wrote Jurasaic Park. The only 'fact' they bother to read are those books next to National Enquirer. They wouldn't understand the first paragraph of a real scientific paper if their live depended on it.    And another said something about 'global tax'. Huh? What the heck do you think we are paying for now in Iraq. We are securing ME oil to make the big oil companies in business. Every American and their daughters and sons will be paying trillions and trillions for this war. How could someone be worried about paying $8 for a DOCUMENTARY (and when was the last time an anti-global warming documentary was free?)and not worry how much he/she is paying for oil?? We are literally paying thousands of dollars in hidden tax for this war. And the only ones to benefit are the rich oil companies and the subcontractors. All awhile making our climate worse. They don't spend hundreds of millions of dollar for nothing. That's where these idiot scientists with their bs findings come from. If cigarette companies, with a fraction of money of oil companies, can still convince people smoking does NOT cause cancer, what do you think oil companies are capable of??????    I'm so glad Americans are waking up, after being raped by the greedy sycophants of this country.
0060839872|4.0|I read the first part of \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle <br />Maintenance\\" with great enjoyment and excitement. Finally, <br />someone found a way to write about philosophy in a way that <br />makes it interesting and accessible to the average <br />reader... quite an achievement. But it was too good to last. <br /> <br />In the second part Pirsig begins to talk about 'quality' <br />and the whole book disintegrates -- because while Pirsig <br />has a genius for explaining the ideas of the great <br />philosophers, his own contribution to the field is <br />less than adequate. 'Quality' as an absolute concept, <br />an objective measurement, a new dimension? C'mon, give <br />us a break! 'Quality' is as culturally-bound, <br />subjective, nebulous as you can get. You have to be a <br />very insular American to think otherwise. <br /> <br />The third part of the book, Pirsig's adventures in <br />academia, reads like the diary of a crank. Apparently <br />Pirsig's ideas did not find much favor in the harsh, <br />skeptical light of the universities, so he took them <br />directly to the masses in the form of this book. Well, <br />good luck to him. <br />
B000F3AAUW|4.0|The song Crazy took me back to the hay days of Motown, love the feel of the music.  That's the reason I bought the cd but I think in all it's a very good collection of songs.
B000IOM0YM|4.0|Un beknowing to alot of people, KISS actually sold the rights to alot of there early Video footage (concerts) decades ago. So the master tapes used for this set were actually copies. <br />I think they did a great job from what they had to work with, it's just unfortunate they could not have stricken a deal with the (person or company) that owns these master tapes. <br />I agree with alot of reviewers that some of the bootleg quality is better, <br />especially if you have copies directly off the master tapes, which I am very fortunate to have. <br />Never the less, it's a great set. Just wish they would have included the FULL Paul Lynde Halloween special with the other two songs. <br />If you buy this set, I highly recommend you buy the Wal-Mart Set. The quality is awesome on the Largo show. <br />Hats off to KISS for giving the people what they want! <br />Looking forward to all of the next installments in KISSOLOGY!  <br />
B000FA57RG|4.0|The CD has some fresh new mixes of older songs, with a lot of bass.  The DVD that comes with it is also great - much like Truth or Dare, but Madonna is a nicer person now.  I definitely recommend this.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|When Shrek first came out in theaters it was instantly recognized as an animated classic.  The script, voices, and animation all combined to create a film that all ages could enjoy.  The humor caters to both children and adults, though there are times when the kids won't know why the adults are laughing.  And like every good animated fairy tale, Shrek supplies morals to the story -and these are blended in throughout the film.  Shrek, for instance, wishes people wouldn't judge him for his appearance.  Instead they just think Shrek is \\"a big, ugly, stupid ogre.\\"  The only fault I could find with the film's logic is that Shrek and Donkey continually make fun of the king's short stature throughout the movie.  We don't like the king because he is BAD, not because he is SHORT!   <br />   Overall this is a must have that you can enjoy watching time and time again. <br />Reviewed by: Adam Platts
081541028X|5.0|I would have liked the above review subject title as the book title as well, (actually initially considered by the author himself), but \\"Carrying the Fire - An Astronaut's Journeys\\" like so many other reviewers have said, is just plain TERRIFIC as is!!!  Well deserving of 5 stars, if for no other reason, because it is so well written by former Gemini 10 and Apollo 11 Astronaut, Michael Collins.  Mr. Collins is a highly skilled writer far beyond what most readers might expect from someone intimately involved with NASA and early spaceflight technology.<br /><br />This book was written 33 years ago, when the success of NASA's space program was still a big part of American pride (and still is).  Michael Collins tells it all from his own first hand experiences before, during and after the triumpant return of Apollo 11 of which he played such a crucial role as that mission's Command Module Pilot.<br /><br />His up close and personal account of Apollo 11 is really only one part, a relatively small part of \\"his\\" story as a flyer.  However, there were many other 'stories' that led up to that flight, that played a far bigger part of an Astronaut's story.  This book is about the WHOLE story of something that most of us will never really know ALL about, nor intimately live and breath during our daily lives.<br /><br />Michael Collins actually LIVED that life while dedicating and sacrificing and trying to do all the other things that we all must do.  He had to aspire and sucumb to superhuman demands on his physical, mental and emotional (and family's) well being for many years in preparation for that most historic of space missions, Apollo 11.  That was also the first actually mission to land men on the Moon, and therefore the riskier compared to all that followed.<br /><br />Apollo 11 was fascinating and famously successful, but still incredibly dangers.  However, it was its predessor, Apollo \\"1\\", that was by far the most hazardous, in which three of Collins' fellow NASA astronauts lost their lives to a fire in the same (although earlier design) type of spacecraft while still on the launch pad performing \\"routine\\" tests.  Apollo 13 demonstrated that these risks are REAL once again, but such were the clear and present dangers of the manned space program back in the 60s, and earlier 70s.  Those risks are still ongoing during the more recent era of the Space Shuttle missions as has been tragically (and sadly) seen twice since the earlier \\"space race\\" period.<br /><br />Was all this loss of extraordinary pilots' and/or spacecraft explorers lives worth it?  \\"Carrying the Fire\\" will help answer that question and probe into many other trials and tribulations of manned spaceflight from a very humanistic, boldly adventurous, and often humorous perspective.<br /><br />Get this book, read it, and you be the judge.  I could not put my copy down until it WAS read, cover to cover.  For me, it was a fascinating book, eloquent in so many ways, and simply just that INTERESTING!<br /><br />Michael Collins is a true American hero of the manned space program and we, (and the many more newer generations of astronauts) are all better for his many outstanding contributions, both in flight and on the ground; none-the-least of which is this book of his memoirs.fire in the same (although earlier design) type of spacecraft while still on the launch pad performing \\"routine\\" tests.

B000CNFC76|5.0|Although I am not into sports, I found this movie very entertaining and heartwarming even if you are not a golfer.  It's a great pick me up movie and proves you don't have to have violence or swearing to find a movie that is enjoyable for any age. It's has a feel good kind of storyline.
0553212621|5.0|It is almost unbelievable, how this book could ever have raised a scandal, whereas it deals with love in a most human and indeed loving way. This tells us more about earlier readers than about the author. Everybody who is able to abandon the carthesian beliefs that ruined pleasure in enjoying life in the flesh as well as in the spirit will enjoy this masterpiece of literature.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Awright people. For the folks that already bought the complete series, this re-release isn't for you. So there's no need to stop moaning and groaning about how Warner is ripping you. Warner isn't ripping you off if you ain't buying it... <br /> <br />Warner re-released this for the folks who didn't buy it the first time around. The first release with the special box is sold out through official channels. Sure, you can find copies in the Amazon third party sellers. That's always an option. <br /> <br />But for those of us who never got around to buying the complete series, this is an excellent way to relive a whole decade of Friends.
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant are an incredible compliment to each other in this comedy of slapstick proportions.  It is a silly pairing of the first romantic-comedy hero Cary Grant and the sophisticated tomgirl Katherine Hepburn.  So many great moments in this film bring up laughs and chuckles.  A must-have for any Cary or Kate fan!  Too fun to miss out on!
0783226845|5.0|One of the greatest speeches ever found in a Hollywood movie (except for Patton) is given by Al Pacino in this movie (I supposed this is one of the reasons why he won an Academy Award for 1993 as Best Actor). This is a little known movie with such great performances and acting all around. Rather long, the movie is about a retired, blind, bitter, Army Lieutenant Colonel (played by Al Pacino) and a young preppie (played by Chris O'Donnell). Both spending a wild weekend in New York City, both facing crisis in their lives, both learning about each other, both acquiring strength from each other to continuing on.(I am not saying more about the plot as it will spoil the fun).  I seen this movie for under $5.00 in a retailing store. What a shame, such a performance and great movie is worth a lot more!!!! Go buy it, is worth every penny (which is what you paying for it today). The haunting sound of an English Horn in the beginning and end sets the character of this movie, beautiful and great.

What a stunning surprise!  I suppose because of the timeframe (1980s), I was expecting another mediocre hair band with bombastic delivery.  I am pleased to write that Queensryche shows immense creativity, musicality, and even genius in this masterwork, performed by excellent musicians obviously dedicated to their craft. <br /> <br />Buy this album NOW!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Al Gore is a moron.  And there is not much worse in this life than being lectured to by an avuncular dolt. <br /> <br />There are countless scientists who give no credence whatsoever to the notion of a man-made climate change.  The whole notion of \\"global warming\\" was based upon an incorrect computer model that could in no way take all parameters and data into account. <br /> <br />In this movie we are lectured to by a boring idiot whose only recourse to changing the political world is through environmental scare tactics. <br /> <br />If you have some time to kill and absolutely nothing else to do with it, then buy and watch this movie.  I would rather watch paint dry or grass grow, they are far more honest processes.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|By far one of the best television series I have ever had the joy of watching.  I wasn't able to catch it when it actually aired on television, but the trailers for the movie really peaked my interest.  So I borrowed the series from the guy the next dorm room over, and just like that my roommate and I were hooked.  The characters are all excellent, the universe is incredibly imaginative (it's part of what inspired me to take Chinese this semester), and the story is terribly intriguing (even if it does follow Joss Whedon's typical superheroine motif).  Not all of the episodes are fantastic, but it's rare when a series hits a grand slam in its first season, which makes me sad to think that Firefly was never able to reach its full potential.  Buy this series, buy Serenity, and join the Browncoats.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This movie is just good fun and contains some of the earliest CGI. I believe it's worth the purchase
B000H30B2C|2.0|Some other reviewers who realized this film is as bad as it is pointed out its many, many flaws, so I won't reiterate them.  Suffice it to say, it's not the real King Kong story (girl *loves* ape?  Right. . .)  And the cartoon physics were so over the top as to make the movie into a true cartoon (except it wasn't funny -- at least not intentially so -- well, perhaps the whole film was a bad joke).  Sad.  Lord of the Rings was truly exceptional.  This film is a parody at best. To recap: little characterization (at least that made sense), no depth, unbelievable motives (again, girl *loves* ape?  Sheesh!), and no attempt to make the action scenes believable.  What a disappointment!
0300108834|5.0|When I first picked up this book, I was mesmerized by the tone of awe and curiosity established by the author, E H Gombrich.  Since I work with elementary school teachers, I highly recommend that every teacher makes sure that a copy of this book sits on the shelf of resources and references for children.  While the book is written from a Eurocentric perspective and devotes more attention to Europe and the Western world, it is sensitive and respectful toward Africa, Asia, and South America.  The story about the author, writing for children in Vienna, is touching and should be made explicit to the students as we would with any other author.  Gombrich taps into our imaginations in the very first chapter with images of a \\"memory-light\\" disappearing down a deep, deep well, or of the ocean waves ceaselessly whispering \\"once upon a time\\".  After you share this book with children, you will delight in their questions and enthusiasm, and they will develop a life-long interest in \\"long, long ago\\".
B0009P42VE|1.0|This is my first real negative experience with Amazon.  I would have sworn that they would 'no problem, we're sorry' exchange the PSP disc with the Extraordinarily Deluxe that I and so many others ordered.  Deeply disappointed to learn that they're only return-and-refunding. I have heard of them honoring much more substantial pricing errors... this didn't even seem like much of one.  It was a 'good' price, yes ($13.99 pre-order for the new 2 dvd/1 cd Grail re-package), but it wasn't SUCH a ridiculous goof that it seemed impossible...<br /><br />Anyway.  Won't turn me off of Amazon forever, of course, but it does besmirch the near-perfect record they had going.

0767817710|4.0|This movie gets a solid 4 stars from me. The story here is not for someone who wants to watch a deep thinking solid movie; on the contrary it is an extremely basic one as in any basic old classic western.<br />However the difference here between an old and new western is immense.<br />This movie got its rating from me based on the following:<br />Photography and sound quality: 5 stars<br />Acting: 4.5 stars<br />Costumes: 5 stars<br />Sharon Stone: 5 stars<br />Music: 5 stars<br />Story: 3.5 stars.<br />So the total really is 4.5 stars. If you are in a relaxed mood and wanting a laid back western movie; this is the one.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I'll be the first to admit it: I was not a fan of My Chemical Romance. This was exactly the type of band I had taken to ignoring; it sounded like pop-punk, so it had to be worthless in my eyes. My Chemical Romance was nothing more than a derivative band with no identity, a group who were more interesting in vampires and selling T-Shirts than in crafting essential music. My disinterest was such that when told by a friend that the new single (the epic \\"Welcome to the Black Parade\\") was actually good, I distractedly listened to the first three minutes and said I liked them. After all, I couldn't be missing much, could I?  <br /> <br />It turns out that I was missing a lot, and in writing this, I'm going to eat my words. It was easy to dismiss My Chemical Romance before, but now it will be impossible. With The Black Parade, an urgent, passionate, insane, awesome piece of music, this band has become essential to the musical landscape. This is an album for the ages. <br /> <br />The Black Parade is a concept album, and tells the story of a man known only as The Patient, a victim of cancer. The album starts with the Patient's death, spends its midsection ruminating on the life he left behind, and ends with his good-byes. It's a hugely ambitious work, and it would have been so easy for it to implode into a sloppy, incoherent mish-mash of \\"sensitive\\", junior high level poetry and forgettable power chords.  <br /> <br />That's the kind of thing the old MCR would do. It's what characterized their first two albums, their Goth-oriented fashion sense, everything about them. But that's the thing about this album: more than anything, it's a coming out for the new My Chemical Romance--a glorious, unapologetically theatrical behemoth. The Black Parade of the title is as much a celebration of this new sound as it is a rite of passage for the deceased protagonist. <br /> <br />Here we see MCR dipping their toe into all sorts of musical styles. \\"Mama\\" starts out as a baroque number reminiscent of The Decemberists, before evolving into an exuberantly nasty cabaret number (complete with a cameo by Liza Minelli). \\"Teenagers\\" is a throwback to some of the best punk rock of the 70's. The lyrics may not exactly be poetry, but they don't have to be. The juxtaposition between the bombastic grandiosity of the musical arrangements themselves and the direct, bruising quality of the lyrics (Cancer's icky \\"I'm soggy from the chemo\\" sticks in the mind) make for a sort of abrasive splendor; this is possibly the most triumphant album about death and dying that has ever been recorded.  <br /> <br />None of this would matter of course, if the music itself wasn't up to snuff. Here, frontman Gerard Way reveals a previously untapped musicianship, an ability to make the hugeness of The Black Parade's sound remain fresh through the use of diverse instrumentation and irresistible hooks (something The Killers failed to do in their similarly anthemic but overcooked sophomore album). It isn't every band that manages not only to stick a tra-la-la sing-along at the end of a song song, but dare you not to sing along with it.  <br /> <br />And now, as the Patient joins his Black Parade, as the hype dies down, as the implications of this astounding achievement make themselves known, questions arise: was it a fluke? Did My Chemical Romance always have this untapped potential? And, perhaps most importantly: what's next? All I have to say is this: Gerard, the ball is in your court.  <br /> <br />10/10

0316172324|5.0|I found this book to be very interesting and useful.  It refers to decisions that are made consciously or unconsciously in the \\"blink\\" of an eye, literally snap decisions. Real-world references are made to both good and bad decisions others have made and explains why they turned out as such.  It further recommends considering why you would make a snap decision and analyzes the strengths an weaknesses of the same, thus reinforcing the likelihood of making an accurate decision. I always recommend this book to my students in the health care field and almost all of them praise it highly. <br />
B000BHN7D4|5.0|Anastacia is HUGE everywhere it seems but in the United States.  I find this unbelievable since she has the total package: gorgeous, great body and great voice - everything a record label dreams of.  Think of her as Shania Twain beauty meets Taylor Dayne's sounding voice with Martina McBride's strength of voice.  Pieces of a Dream is a Greatest Hits collection that features such hits as I'm Outta Love, Cowboys & Kisses, Paid My Dues, You'll Never Be Alone, Left Outside Alone, and Heavy On My Heart.  This is a fantastic album to start with as it gives you a good idea of what her other albums offer.  I own all of them, I suggest you look into it as well.

B000BTC5LW|2.0|This [...], I mean. You know, the lasers and the effects, not bad, but, Floyd minus Roger Waters is not Floyd. You have a fat guitarist who insist in singing almost all the songs, and it's not the same old voice no matter how many filters and pedals the mic has. An almost crippled drummer like Mason (not the same as Live at Pompeii, that's a DVD!), and because of that, they have to add a monkey jumping behind him. Plus, they had to call Rick (they fired him, remember?) because Floyd minus two, is even less Floyd. The track list is a complete \\"Greatest hits\\", to assure that the people who went to the show have their expectations fullfiled.<br /><br />So, in the other hand, you have Roger Waters's In the Flesh tour. And that's a wise dude... He chose good songs, songs that Gilmour wouldn't dare include in their set because people would surely walk away, like \\"Dogs\\", \\"Set the controls for the heart of the sun\\" and many more alongside with his own brilliant material, which is an add-on of his lasts works with Floyd -when he pick the band as hired musicians more or less, he he-. Pink Floyd was always a band who did shows to challenge the audience. The Wall is the final demonstration of that, with a wall separating the public from the musicians. The final cut is the last Floyd album, period. I heard the other day Momentary lapse of reason and is a good album, but, compared with the impressive collection starting in Dark side, plus Wish you were here, Animals (for me, the best Floyd album), The Wall and the Final cut, Momentary is a shame, not good enough to carry on the name Pink Floyd on it.<br /><br />Roger (and I have my ticket for the concert in Argentina on march already) is clever enough not to sing all the songs, so he picks the appropiate vocalist for the song that needs a special pitch. So, if you want to see simple entertainment, this is for you -as Blue Man Group and Cirque du Soleil-, but if you want to see a real concert, a concert Floyd alike -if you want to think, I must say-, you have to buy Roger's DVD. Plain simple.ay-, you have to buy Roger's DVD. Plain simple.

0618680004|3.0|When I originally read \\"The God Delusion\\" I had planned to give it a 5 star review and a high recommendation. However, in the time since reading the book, I have had the benefit of discussing the book with several religious people, reading some of the more interesting critical reviews (eg Marilynn Robinson in Harpers and Terry Eagleton in the London Review of books) and also re-reading a number of sections of the book. <br /> <br />As a result, I have downgraded my rating from 5 to 3 stars. While I still agree with Dawkins' primary arguments, and admire the energy and enthusiasm of the book (as well as the project of demolishing the god myth), and the book remains as entertaining as it did on a first reading, \\"The God Delusion\\" has a number of significant flaws. <br /> <br />Dawkins critics have generally focussed on a small number of issues - historical inaccuracies, the inadequate treatment (and rebuttal) of the \\"proofs\\" of the existence of god, the complete absence of positive value attributed to religion, the failure to acknowledge that atheism and science are capable of negative outcomes (nuclear and chemical weapons being often cited), and the generally contemptuous tone adopted towards religion. There is some truth to a number of these claims, to varying degrees. The fact that science can produce bad things is one which many reviewers have mentioned, as though this moral equivalence with religion also implies a factual equivalence. However, even if one accepts that science can do things quite as bad as religion, this does not detract from the fact that science is factually correct (and this can easily be demonstrated by the workings of any household appliance) while religion is patently false (again, easily demonstrated by the complete absence of any clear evidence that prayer, for example, has any real effect), and science does not claim to be inherently moral, as religion does. <br /> <br />There are a number of additional criticisms which can be made: thefrequent references to \\"consciousness raising\\" as a result of evolution, which sounds too much like revelation or enlightenment for my tastes, given that this book is a critique of such revelatory thinking (though I agree that evolution is an extremely powerful way of thinking about the world, and certainly more effective than religion). There is also the evolution-centric view of the world from which Dawkins derives most of his arguments and perspectives. This is very much an evolutionary biologist's take on the world, and it is difficult to criticise him for this, but one can see that a physicist for example might approach these issues from a completely different perspective.  <br /> <br />Dawkins' speculations about the reasons for the genetic predisposition toward religious belief are, in my view, unconvincing. While these are acknowledged to be speculative, even a confirmed atheist such as me has an intuitive feeling that there must be a deeper need for religion (as a useful social or evolutionary strategy) than is suggested by his explanation of religion as an unnecessary by-product of other evolutionary phenomena.  Of course, as Dawkins notes, even if there is clear evidence that religion has positive evolutionary or other benefits, that does not make it factually correct. <br /> <br />As a number of critics have pointed out, Dawkins' discussion of the various \\"proofs\\" of the existence of god is cursory at best. However, as far as I am aware, while many people have criticised Dawkins' superficial treatment of the proofs, it appears to be tacitly accepted even by his most hostile critics that there really is no compelling, logical proof of the existence of god. So, while the theists are critical of the summary treatment of the proofs, they ultimately concede this ground to Dawkins - as if they know that there is, and can never be, such proof, but cannot state this quite so openly - and go on to attack his secondary arguments about the value (positive or negative) of religion.  <br /> <br />I do not like Dawkins' attempt to equate the position of atheism with gay rights, not because I am homophobic but because I think they are quite different for many reasons. Similarly, I do not agree with his suggestion that atheists adopt the term \\"Brights\\", in much the same way that homosexuals have used the term \\"gay\\". Atheism is, for most people, the result of a rational process of reasoning about the world; it is not a belief system, a culture or a movement, and to regard it as such is to fall into the argument raised (incorrectly) by theists that atheism is merely a competing set of beliefs or values which has no greater validity than any other ethical system such as religion. I care less that \\"Brights\\" is condescending, implying greater intelligence - it is probably true.  <br /> <br />While The God Delusion is highly entertaining, and is to be admired for sheer chutzpah, it fails because it is not as rigorous as a book of this kind needs to be. Any chink in Dawkins' argument - whether a fault in logic, a biblical misquote or a historical inaccuracy - will be, and has been, seized upon by theists as a means to attack the entire enterprise. The condescending tone is also one which will predispose many people to reject Dawkins' arguments, and that is a great pity. While I agree with the core arguments of The God Delusion, and certainly applaud the effort, this is ultimately not the great, compendious, scholarly, unassailable defence of atheism that is so desperately needed, and that is why I have reduced my rating. However, for all that, it is still a great read, raises many interesting issues at a time when they are needed, and is highly recommended. <br /> <br />

B00005JPB4|5.0|'I'll walk alone / because to tell you the truth I am lonely / I don't mind being lonely ..'    Those haunting lyrics, sung acapella over the opening credits by none other than Clint Eastwood himself, foreshadow the tragic fate of the three tortured souls at the heart of Flags of Our Fathers. This sad and moving elegy to the boys captured in Joe Rosenthal's famous photograph of the Iwo Jima flag-raising is one of the best films of the year. At 76 Clint Eastwood has developed the most extraordinary focus as a director and storyteller. Nothing distracts him. Even the jaw-dropping CG-enhanced battle scenes are used not to wow audiences vicariously but to underline why the three survivors are so haunted by their memories and why they will remain so for the rest of their lives.    The screenplay by Paul Haggis & William Broyles, Jnr. tracks three separate stories in three different time periods - the battle, the bond tour & a present day father/son bookend - then jumps back and forth between them in an unsettling manner that allows Eastwood and his superb editor Joel Cox to construct extraordinary juxtapositions between the horrors of the battlefield and the surreal acclaim experienced by the survivors on their bond tour. Some viewers have complained about this allegedly 'confusing' storytelling but in my humble opinion if you're paying attention and just go with the flow then the film is not hard to follow. You just need to be paying attention.    Flags covers a lot of ground yet despite a big cast & multiple themes it never loses its focus on Bradley and the other two flag-raisers. The ensemble cast is uniformly excellent. Of the principals Adam Beach has the showiest role as Ira Hayes, a tormented Indian inconsolable at the loss of his buddies, Ryan Phillippe is Navy corpsman John 'Doc' Bradley, who takes a stoic attitude to his experiences while Jesse Bradford turns in a sympathetic performance as the good looking Marine Rene Gagnon who hopes to capitalise on his newfound fame.      Clint Eastwood deserves much credit here. Any other helmer could have easily gotten carried away with over-indulging the battle scenes, ramping up an emotional moment or drawing heavy-handed parallels with todays war (one shudders at the prospect of Oliver Stone having directed Flags), but Eastwood's uncanny knack for understatement allows him to navigate around  all these obstacles without ever seeming exploitative or heavy-handed. Indeed some of the most affecting moments in Flags - subdued Marines listening to music the night before battle, Ira walking down a winding country road after delivering a message to the father of a dead comrade, a joyous swim in the ocean - are some of the quietest.    Flags is also unlike other war movies in that it gives centre stage to the PR aspects of fighting a war. After all what happens on the home front can be just as important in winning as what happens on the battlefield. It's a sobering thought and the film plays fair by the Govt while dissecting the publics need for heroes and the enormous weight that need places on those lucky or unlucky enough to have to live up to the acclaim. The story underlines how the experience of combat can become a closed book even to family members. There is more thematic/narrative meat to chew on here than in a dozen Saving Private Ryan's and it qualifies as yet another major work (at the age of 76, amazing!) from America cinemas greatest living director.

B000058BGZ|5.0|I entirely agree with the previous reviewer. I can't talk about this music technically. What I do like about the dodecaphonic music of Schoenberg (and Berg and Webern) is, unlike music written strictly in keys, the feeling of gliding with it across variations of a landscape and touching down at times to take another stride. This piece was my accidental introduction to serial music and I have returned to it over decades to discover why and how it so transfixed me. I drifted from recording to recording until I realized the glide and stride of the experience. To my mind after years of reading about what goes on in serial music, those touch-downs must be those places where my ear hears tonal moments--after all, how can it not? And then striding, gliding, dancing with Ms Uchida in partnership with the orchestra across mosiacally shifting impressions, at times poignant and dolorous, at others charming, ebullient and delightful, as wines can sometimes be. It doesn't leave one humming, nor does one finally, entirely touch-down. Not an objective or technical appraisal, but pleasure, sometimes, is a knowledge difficult to withold--and articulate.

B000JLTRKE|5.0|This retelling of one part of 9/11 struck several chords. You will know the story of Port Authority cops trapped beneath the collapsed Twin Towers who just do all they can to survive, thinking about their lives, their families, and overcoming their life-threatening injuries through the primal instinct to survive. This movie is expertly done with superb production, acting, effects and clever use of news footage interseprsed with the movie. Nicolas Cage has made many movies, some great(THE ROCK, GONE IN 60 SECONDS, LORD OF WAR, CON AIR), others not so great(8MM, BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), but without a doubt this is his best role. Being crushed beneath the rubble you just cannot imagine until you see this.<br /><br />And WTC is NOT political in any way or form, you will see that persons from 87 countries - including many Islamic nations - died in the attack.<br /><br />Work colleagues of my wife were killed when one of the adjacent buildings was hit - the Compaq building was one of the first to go when the towers collapsed and this brought back some memories and opened a can of worms a bit. I didn't cry in the cinema(this came much later on), as being a writer who covers such subjects I guess I am used to dealing with it, and I do read many sides of events these days. Worth letting people know as well that I was almost caught up in a bombing in Paris in 1995 on the Metro, escaping it by 14 minutes. So it also struck a nerve there.<br /><br />The effects of seeing the collapse from an INSIDE point of view of the Port Authority cops was somehow more dramatic than seeing repeated new footage of the towers again as in our cinema, the surround sound gave the whole experience additional impact.<br /><br />If anything, these attacks - and the many more that have followed such as those in London, Madrid and Bali have brought more people together and there is more good than evil in any society as the movie goes to prove. The Marine who found the cops trapped in the rubble who wanted to go and avenge the attack was well portrayed - summed up many people's feelings, but sadly the war on terror has suffered from bad fighting strategies and an overzealous cowboy of a President.<br /><br />One day events such as 9/11 will stop and maybe we can one day live in a world free from terror, but it is up to us to make that happen.<br /><br />Everyone should see this movie, and I would also recommend UNITED 93 and FLIGHT 93 for another significant event of that fateful day.le who wanted to go and avenge the attack was well portrayed - summed up many people's feelings, but sadly the war on terror has suffered from bad fighting strategies and an overzealous cowboy of a President.  <br /> <br />One day events such as 9/11 will stop and maybe we can one day live in a world free from terror, but it is up to us to make that happen. <br /> <br />Everyone should see this movie, and I would also recommend UNITED 93 and FLIGHT 93 for another significant event of that fateful day.

B000GCFO08|4.0|Loosely based on a video game of the same name, Silent Hill is a film that most people have concluded that they either like or hate.  The former tend to be a demographic that have played the original game, or games from the series (there have been 4 made thus far), I would fall into this category.  The latter are your horror film fans looking for the next great flick but have no prior context of the Silent Hill lore.  Though created by  a Japanese video game developer,  Konami, the Silent Hill series has always had a Western flavor of horror which has created a greater than cult following here in the States and gives it an innate edge as a film adaptation for Western movie-goers.  And unlike its distant, but most relatable relative Resident Evil (another survival/horror game-to-movie), Silent Hill was a cinematic thriller as a game and overflowing with potential to be transitioned to theaters.  Director Christophe Gans makes an admirable attmept, but Silent Hill fails to be as great as it could have been.    The movie begins with a little girl, Sharon, sleepwalking and having nightmares and the only thing her parents, Rose and Christopher, can figure out is it must have something to do with \\"Silent Hill\\" as she is heard repeating this during her spells.  Okay, so what is Silent Hill?  By doing a google search, Christopher, along with the viewer, learns that Silent Hill is an abandoned, haunted town in West Virginia.  Not even 10 minutes later, movie time of course, Rose is already taking her daughter to this mysterious place in attempt to try to help her daughter with whatever is ailing her.   While clearly making everything seem rushed and unbelievable this started the movie off on the wrong foot and the choice of sequencing was unnecessary to begin with.  A better beginning would have been to start the movie with Rose and Sharon going to Silent Hill and then reveal the build-up and motivation to the decision with the scenes that followed.      This shortcoming canbe overlooked, however, due to the fact that once the pair arrives at Silent Hill, and for the hour that follows, the audience is drawn into the eerie world of Silent Hill and the things that inhabit it.  Slowly the viewer begins to learn the nature of Sharon as well as the haunted town she was drawn to.  An effective use of cinematography and CG really bring the world of Silent Hill as established in the game to life and perpetuates a psychological suspense in the viewer.  The most rewarding kind of creepy is the type that forces the audience to remain on the edge of their seat with subtlety as opposed to doing it with an overabundance of in your face shock.  And for a cast of actors I was completely unfamiliar with, I found the acting more than competent, sans one or two performances. Also of note is the way the film's soundtrack provides a perfect complement to the experiences being portrayed.  It will sound very familiar to fans of the games as many of the songs are straight from their soundtracks, which are remarkable in their own right and the creation of musical guru Akira Yamaoka.   Even the songs exclusive to the movie are very well done and enhance the theatrical ambiance.    Unfortunately, for all the momentum that was building during the first half of the movie, the downside is it's somewhat relinquished during the final 40 minutes when the suspense begins to sputter and scenes are fleshed out longer than they needed to be.  It's at this point that only people who are familiar with the games will be endeared while everyone else begins to get a sense of `been there, done that' and will feel that have figured everything out.  This is coupled with the fact that before the final climatic moments, the movie goes out of its way to tie up loose ends removing all the mystery, which is a major complaint that's been mentioned by other reviewers.  To the contrary, there are still enough subtle plot holes that aren't made apparent that will leave the more attentiveviewer contemplating long after the credits have rolled.    You don't have to be a film expert to realize that Silent Hill is far from perfect so it would be irresponsible to rate it 5 stars.  Yet the film still marks a major victory in the viability of video games being transfigured from a console to a movie theater due to all the careless attempts that have occurred over the years.  And if you have developed any kind of relationship with the original Silent Hill game, this movie deserves 4 stars and is worthy of a purchase even though it proves unfaithful to the original script.  For everyone else, this film garners 3 ½ stars and should be watched at least once since it does a healthy amount of things right.  Ultimately Silent Hill is a gratifying experience that you won't regret investing 2 hours into.
B000DN6D3M|5.0|This is either a truly underrated record or forgotten gem, whichever you want to choose. From the day it came out I thought it was great music by two significant talents, and I never understood why it did not acheive greater popularity. The alternating cuts, each taking his turn, really works, and I think this is the best work Townshend has ever done, outside of the Who, of course. As for Ronnie Lane, well of course I knew of him from the Faces & had heard some of his solo work, but I had bought the album (now I'm dating myself!) largely to hear Townshends' work. To my surprise, I thought Lane's work was stronger, and I still occasionally will hum songs like \\"Annie\\" while mindlessly walking around or doing something. This is really a damn fine album, and I recommend it to any fan of good introspectively-oriented music.

B000J10ERO|5.0|I loved this movie.  I am a life long Superman fan and I was enitially very apprehensive about a new Superman movie.  This met all my expectations.  Brian Singer has that golden touch.  Superman Returns has the perfect mix of emotion and action.  Brandon Routh had some very large shoes to fill and I think he did a truly wonderful job.  I can't wait for the sequal. <br /> <br />I don't recommend listening to anyone's negative comments regarding this movie.  Everyone is entitled to their own oppinions and I suggest you see the movie and decide for yourself without being tainted by other people's veiws.  There will always be those searching for fault in movies of this type.  I don't really understand why people who call themselves \\"fans\\" seek to tear down that which they love.  So, just ignore them and I think you will love this movie too!
B000I0RNV6|5.0|I bought the new version on vhs. It's a fabulous movie. One of the best I have ever seen. This DVD has both versions as well as the commentary. Don't pass it up. If it goes out of print,which it did before,you won't be able to find it. It's about a boys love for movies. I didn't get the least bit boored even though it is a long movie. I truly see how it became an Amazon.com essential movie. It's one of mine now too.
B000GY729M|5.0|The Killer's sophomore release, 'Sam's Town', will more than likely be described as one of two things by listeners; it will be raved upon as a huge growth in maturity and sound or else hated as a disappointing change in the style that made the group so popular with 'Hot Fuss'. However, both of these descriptions are inaccurate. Rather, it is more than apparent that the band enjoys creating themed albums. 'Hot Fuss' was laden with upbeat, synthetic pop sounds that paradoxically carried songs about envy, heartbreak, dishonesty, and murder. The album was a collection of flashy, overproduced, yet dark tracks that created what was reminiscent of the ever-ironic, slightly discomforting film 'A Clockwork Orange'. `Sam's Town', in comparison, occupies a much different theme, which accounts for a very distinct album, no doubt respectable in its own right. <br /> <br />With the release of their second disc, the band continues to remain faithful to a few characteristics that leave them recognizable by the general public. Brandon Flowers' vocals remain strained, yet captivating--much like his off-stage antics. In addition, the band continues to film music videos that try just a little too hard to be artsy, forgetting that their music career thus far lacks room for pretension. Overall, however, `Sam's Town' is a far cry from that which The Killers created with `Hot Fuss'. The use of synthesizers, which so famously set the band apart on their first disc, is dramatically reduced, as the guitar plays a more prominent role. In addition, the group has poured more meaning and emphasis into the lyrics. Though they do remain less than spectacular, the album relies more heavily on them, whereas `Hot Fuss' prominently featured buoyant melodies as the foremost point of interest. With this focus on the lyrics, it is unsurprising that Flowers' emotion can be heard through the vocals. Keeping with the theme of the album, this is done intentionally. `Sam's Town' deals with simple, small town life, and focuses on family, love, life choices, and nostalgia. Its voice is intense and passionate, while `Hot Fuss' remained loosely attached to its subject matter, showing a sense of carelessness surrounding dramatic occurrences. <br /> <br />Overall, there are a few moments of weakness in `Sam's Town', but the album in general is a solid collection of tracks listenable either together or individually. The `Enterlude' and `Exitlude' are the largest mistakes on the album. The group's attempt to make a disc with a solid opening and closing was unneeded with such a solid theme already in place. The `Enterlude' takes more from the album than the `Exitlude', though they are almost identical in sound. Being placed after the upbeat title track, it slows down the album unnecessarily before speeding it up again a mere 50 seconds later. The `Exitlude' would have been a good closing for the album, however its predecessor, `Why Do I Keep Counting' already contains a magnificent closing which would have finished the album nicely, thus the `Exitlude' was excessive and redundant.  <br /> <br />Fans of `Hot Fuss' will likely be taken aback with such a different sound on `Sam's Town', but when judged as a separate album with an entirely different premise, The Killer's second album provides a good listen and a solid album overall. The disc shows off, not only musical talent, but also flair for creating a well-rounded, well-thought-out premise and creative ways to connect ideas and stories. Definitely recommended.

0802136834|5.0|For a nonfiction historical account, this book is amazingly captivating.  I bought it to take on vacation and found myself picking it up every time I had 5 minutes to read.  I've read about this period from a variety of nonfiction and fictional accounts, and found it interesting where they don't line up.  Weir does an excellent job of pointing out these discrepancies, giving different viewpoints, supporting documentation, and rationale for her choice.  I felt her treatment of Katherine Howard was a bit judgemental, but on the whole, her characterizations derived from the facts served to make the book emotionally involving and significantly added to its readability.  This is the best account I've read of the period, both from a factual and readability perspective, and one of Weir's best as well.  You won't be disappointed.

0141301066|5.0|Matilda is an extraordinary girl who has read most of the books in the library by age seven (including A Tale of Two Cities).  However, she is stuck with ignorant, mean parents who lie and cheat and who want her to watch television rather than waste time reading.  Through her teacher, Ms. Honey, Matilda discovers just how extraordinary she is and uses her new special powers to help Ms. Honey vanquish her ogre of an aunt, Ms. Trunchbull, and to outwit the witless parents in her own life.  One of Dahl's best along with James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

B0002I831S|5.0|Yes, I am a Star Trek Fan, Not sure if I am a Trekkie, I do not go to conventions, or collect Star Trek Characters, dolls and others, but I enjoy the series. I think like most people about the great story line, moral lessons and the characters. The first season I believe is the best of the three, with great stories, building of the characters and learning about us, the people and how we think and who we are in the scope of the universe.  <br /> <br />The last disk also has special features about the first season with the Actors interviews, comments and insights, along with other people involved with the series.  <br /> <br />I will keep watching Star Trek every 4 to 6 months and still like what I see. Very enjoyable.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Great unsung series and wonderful sci-fi movie. Became a big fan <br />pretty instantly. Thought provoking, great action, intelligent script with real people (not super/people). Love each character. Love the plotline and effects. Love the human dilemma(s) and the not so pure and pretty solutions  <br />to them. A great rogue family on a wonderful no-frills, shabby/classy ship. <br />Feels good to visit and revisit them.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|Mr. Gore obviously has not taken into account an accurate - and unbiased - view of the scientificic evideince on the subject.  I would write more, but it is a waste of time given Mr. Gore's obvious policical, and frankly inadequatate and misleading, perspective on the subject... Ridiculous and not worth your hard-earned money.  If you would like more objective, and entertaining, information I suggest \\"State of Fear\\" by Michael Crichton.

B00004RFFI|5.0|Over the years, people have grown tired of natural disaster movies.  Why?  Because they all appear to be the same.  Here's an example of a typical storyline- everything starts out nice and calm, the story focuses on one family, the family starts having problems and they split up, and then a volcano, tornado, hurricane, or whatever hits, and all the family members somehow miraculously avoid the incredible danger JUST so they can be together again and make up with each other by the end of the movie.   <br /> <br />Well, that kind of typical storyline isn't featured here.  Twister is truly a classic.  It's not ordinary, either.  It's about a group of tornado chasers who, as you guessed, drive around speeding through the country in an attempt to get never-before-seen film of a twister, up close and personal.   <br /> <br />This means the film delivers the most amazing action I have honestly ever seen in a tornado movie.  Twister is definitely better than most of the similar type of films, and I remember in 1996 how influential this movie was.  I was in 9th grade, and the science teacher played Twister for the class a couple times throughout the year because it was SO good and much better than other tornado films.   <br /> <br />Helen Hunt plays a magnificent role.  She is so obsessed with her love of twisters that she barely seems to care about the divorce she's going through.  What's great about this is that, despite giving us a really good story about a divorce, this doesn't interfere with all the tornado action.  There are *so* many good scenes in Twister that show the devastation tornadoes are capable of that it's simply amazing to me how much time and energy had to happen to make this movie. <br /> <br />Favorite scenes?  Well, everyone seems to love the cows floating in the air, so I won't pick that one.  I really liked the part where the twister ripped through the outside movie theater, tearing the big screen to shreds as the people quickly ran away to try and get away from it.  That's just one of MANY awesome scenes.   <br /> <br />The storyline is really good too.  It's not just a story about a divorce between Helen and her husband.  There's a lot more to it than that.  It's complicated because the new girlfriend of the husband shows up and gets involved in all sorts of tornado action (against her will).   <br /> <br />This is such an awesome movie.  I highly recommend it.  Tornado movies don't GET any better than this.  Pure action from beginning to end.  You will be glued to your television screen hoping the tornado chasers manage to escape the devastating danger.  Twister will make you think twice if you're thinking about becoming a tornado chaser.
0670034711|1.0|If you like neurotic self-involved women who never know how to gain control of their lives, this book is for you.  If not, just pass this by. I know she won all kinds of awards from her other books, but this is full of whining and self-pitty. In fact it feels so thin it feels like the notes she took for the article she wrote for a magazine. I couldn't even get past the first section and I'm a huge reader.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|I am really amused by all the negative reviewers who claim to like other stuff of Dylan's but don't like this album. In his last 3 albums, Dylan has achieved a timelessness in which all eras of American music are simultaneously present. He is such a universal figure, having successively remade folk, rock, country, gospel, and blues, that to fail to appreciate him is like failing to appreciate Twain or Shakespeare, an indicator of a narrow cultural background.  These are beautiful songs, with depth of feeling, great lyrical artistry, wise observation, and solid musical architecture, expertly performed and produced. What's not to like? Those who can only appreciate a particular kind of music will STILL find some Dylan they like because he is so protean, but their negativity about the rest of his work is their defect not his. I could make a few quibbles (just one example, Dylan has written too many songs which contain the phrase \\"walk the line\\" or \\"down the line\\"), but this is an album that should be in everyone's collection. Lots of other musicians hang around decades after their creativity has dried up, but one listen to \\"Modern Times\\" makes it obvious that Dylan is inexhaustible.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a great TV series for those freedom outlaws out there who need a little inspiration.  Watch it and be inspired, and reminded who the real bad(ge) guys out there are.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|I really loved this movie.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire time.  Okay, not really. I was actually laying on the couch, but that's beside the point.  The mystery of the storyline is constantly shifting around, and I kept wondering where certain plot twists were going.  To me, that's a sign of a very good, creative storyline.      This is the kind of movie that makes you think while you're watching it, as you sit there thinking to yourself where certain plot twists are leading to.  The amount of creativity this movie featured is out of this world.  I can't believe people are actually giving it bad reviews.  Stay was overall a very good movie.  You just have to pay attention to what's going on.      This movie actually reminded me of another film where a bunch of people were out in a small western town, and one of them was the killer.   Both movies had a really good twist at the very end that tied the storyline together nicely and completely unexpectedly.      To be honest, I didn't entirely understand the ending.  I was left feeling like I didn't quite understand a couple minor things.  Maybe watching it again will help me figure those things out.  It doesn't matter though, because the fact that Stay offered so much makes the film entirely memorable.  In fact, I'm GLAD I couldn't figure it out entirely on first viewing.  That means the second time will be even better.      Whatever this movie is (a suspense, drama, or thriller) I give it the best possible grade available- 5 stars, and it's absolutely ridiculous to give this movie anything lower than 4 stars.
0143036556|3.0|Who among us hasn't been fascinated by stories of societies that suffered a spectacular collapse?  Societies  that didn't end from ordinary, garden-variety modes of failure, such as being wiped out by an earthquake or conquered by the Huns, but were up and running fine one day and seemingly the next day, bam!  The great temples are deserted.  The giant statues are abandoned half-finished in their quarries.  The colony loses contact with the mother country, and the colonists are never heard from again.  Why? <br /> <br />This is a winning premise for a book, and \\"Collapse\\" is worth reading.  Dr. Diamond is a naturalist of many interests, is a good writer, and has important things to say.  It is worth your time to read.  Still, I give the book only three stars, because of three issues: 1) Rowling-ization; 2) Gore-ization; 3) a faint but undeniable whiff of intellectual dishonesty. <br /> <br />Rowling-ization: It is an axiom of publishing today that the more books an author sells, the more lightly he or she is edited.  J.K. Rowling is obviously not edited at all any more.  Like Ms. Rowling's later novels, the current 525 page book contains a 300 page book which would be a better read had it been stripped of the repetitive anecdotes and the multiple restatements of the author's core thesis. <br /> <br />Gore-ization: The compelling need for an author to stand up and give a sermon shouting repent, you fossil fuel fools, the end is near.  Stung by criticism that his previous best-seller \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" was a one-dimensional exercise in biological reductionism, in the current book Dr. Diamond states his five-factor analytical plan up front.  The five factors he identifies are: 1) Resource depletion; 2) climate change; 3) interaction with hostile neighbors; 4) interaction with friendly neighbors; 5) societal willingness to adapt to change in the other four dimensions.  Dr. Diamond manfully applies his five-factor analysis to the past societies he studies, but as he discusses present-day conditions in later chapters, his five-point program is abandoned  and the  discussion collapses to a Gore-esque story of environmental depletion (specifically energy) and human-caused climate change.  Not that these aren't important issues, but not sticking to his five-point framework opens Dr. Diamond up once again to charges of reductionism. <br /> <br />A whiff of intellectual dishonesty: The book's centerpiece is the story of the Greenland Norse, whose story as told by Dr. Diamond is that the Vikings settled Greenland during an extended, unusually warm period (the medieval warm period) when it was possible to practice European farming methods.  This was followed by an extended, unusually cold period (the Little Ice Age) which made it impossible for the Greenland Norse to feed their treasured cattle and to practice their trophy hunts.  Dr. Diamond's core thesis is that the cultural inflexibility of the Greenland Norse in the face of climate change lead to their doom.  The intellectual dishonesty comes in to play when you realize that the climate-change writers quoted so liberally in the later chapters of \\"Collapse\\" deny that there even were such things as the \\"medieval warm period\\" and \\"the little Ice Age.\\"  Among writers from the hockey-stick school of post Industrial Revolution global warming, these phrases are never used without sneer quotes or a qualifying \\"so-called.\\"  Dr. Diamond most surely knows this.  However, if there were no massive, pre-Industrial Revolution global climate swings, then Dr. Diamond's analysis of the Greenland Norse falls apart, and he has no book.  If this is not outright intellectual dishonesty, then it is at the least a highly selective and self-serving selection from the climate change literature.
074322454X|5.0|Historian Stephen Ambrose's 1992 account of Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, has become a classic of the Second World War, inspiring an absolutely superb HBO mini-series and a small cottage industry of additional accounts by members of the unit.  In a gripping narrative, Ambrose recounts the company's journey from its birth at Camp Taccoa in 1942 to the airborne jump into Normandy on 6 June 1944 through Holland, Bastogne, and into the heart of Nazi Germany.  Ambrose's account is detailed and candid, capturing the thoughts and fears of members of the unit and the alternating horrors and boredom of combat.<br /><br />What raises \\"Band of Brothers\\" above hundreds of other similar accounts is Ambrose's moving exploration of how tough training and good leadership built Easy Company into a nearly unbreakable fighting unit, excelling in every mission.  Ordinary men, working together, became capable of extraordinary accomplishments under difficult, even impossible conditions, refusing to let each other down.  Ambrose describes how individual soldiers meshed into the company and how unit chemistry evolved under a series of leaders.  Ambrose is especially candid in describing why some men succeeded and other men failed the tests of leadership.<br /><br />\\"Band of Brothers\\" is very highly recommended to the general reader looking for the story behind the phenomenon and to students of history looking for a superb small unit history and an exemplar of the airborne tradition from the Second World War.

0446528056|5.0|I've been looking forward to reading this book for months now. I received it the other day and ended up being so into the story that I couldn't put it down (except to sleep). Wow. Almost every single Nicholas Sparks book makes me shed a few tears, but in this one, I honestly could feel the pain that John was going through. This is a great book to read on a cold winter day, curled up with a blanket. I felt that John and Savannah were people that I could have known and cared about. Some readers thought \\"Dear John\\" was too depressing; but that's the way life is sometimes.
B0009UVBQI|5.0|I first saw this movie as a rental, and my daughter and I couldn't stop laughing. Having a week on the rental, and a dull week, I watched it again a few days later- something I religiously avoid- and surprising to me, I was laughing as hard as the first time around. As that has never happened before, I heartily recommend this movie for anyone who has seen a Bruce Lee, Jet Li, Jackie Chan, or the more \\"sophisticated\\" Crouching Tiger or Flying Dagger movies. This movie has subtle and slapstick humor (e.g., the unremovable cigarette in the matriarch's mouth), but is quite intelligent, and encompasses good cinematography with subtle effects (such as the visually vibrating heat waves as the bad guys first approach the slum village). Yes, it is cartoonish in parts, but is an intelligent cartoon, if that makes sense. I plan to buy a copy now for many future viewings.
B000777J2S|5.0|I recognize that there is really no way to account for personal taste. Each time I listen to this disc, I think to myself that there have got to be a lot of people who don't or wouldn't like it.  I am glad that I focused on the positive reviews posted here on Amazon and took into account that if Antony were talentless that Lou Reed, Rufus Wainwright and Boy George would not have been involved in any of the tracks on I am a Bird Now.  I bought this disc and I love it.  It is wondrous, haunting, beautiful and really affects me each time I hear it. The only thing that bothers me about it is that it is too short. <br /> <br />I disagree that some of the songs are filler.  I think that they are all amazing in their own way.  Antony's use of his voice is interesting . . . involving . . . bizarre . . . like a weird hybrid of Nina Simone and Tiny Tim (if Tim had been remotely cool . . .though I mean no offense to his fans) that  . . . apparently  . . . works for Antony when it wouldn't work for anyone else.  The performances are all kind of over the top . . . but they just work.  As for the lyrics, I think that anyone who has ever felt deep loneliness or aspired to . . .anything related to real human connection . . . could relate to them.  Instead of being bummed out by them, I am uplifted each time I hear those feelings being given such a unique voice. <br /> <br />I have thousands of CDs and have bought many on Amazon over the years but have never written a music review.  I have also bought many books and have written a couple of reviews . . . just to rebut some of the luminous praise heaped on books that I thought were just plain awful.  I write about this disc just to add my voice, my five stars and some words about my . . .awe . . . to all of the other glowing reviews. <br /> <br />If you are pretty open-minded about musical stylings and you like to hear songs about feelings of hope, fear . . .aspiration . . . buy this disc.

B00001U0E1|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The seamless web of ideas about the origins of Shakespeare's plays Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night is so original and refreshing in todays age of film that it makes this movie watchable dozens of times.
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|I think it was an excellent movie about how childhood experiences can effect your entire life. One kid was haunted by the experience and the other must have needed love so much that he lived the life of sex to try to find that love!
B000HBKCDC|1.0|This is predictable stylistic treatment of standard songs by someone who may eventually sound more eccentric than anything else to future listeners.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Would it ever be possible for the people who write these reviews on Amazon and elsewhere to refrain from using that increasingly tiresome cliche which goes something like this: \\"Even though the special effects don't compare with the CGI stuff today they were good for their day...\\" <br /> <br />Can we PLEASE stop writing that corny line? <br /> <br />May I please say something?  (Will anyone even understand?)  Let me try.  The special effects in FORBIDDEN PLANET were excellent in 1956, are still excellent in 2006, and will remain excellent for as long as the film is shown.  Can these reviewers get it through their heads that good special effects don't deteriorate with age?  Rembrandt's \\"Road to Emmaus\\" was great in the seventeenth century and do you know what?  It's still great today!  Go figure. <br /> <br />Let us hope that film criticism for earlier fantasy films will in future be a little more literate and a little more intelligent.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|A great DVD set containing a lot of stuff fans might already have, but likely an equal amount of stuff they don't have. <br />And the 5.1 sound and remastered video is awesome to see and hear. <br /> <br />I would suggest checking a -different- place to get the 1977 Largo Bonus DVD.

0375759174|5.0|This early Jane Austen novel is a satire among other things of the reading tastes of the Romantic Period's young, sending up their near addiction to improbable Gothic \\"horror\\" stories. Despite being grounded in such literary particulars, the novel remains an awfully good read. Contemporary college students in my experience think overwhelmingly that Austen is not just writing about Mrs. Radcliffe et al, but has much to tell them about life and taking one another seriously rather than playing at \\"relationships.\\" Detailing the entrance of her naive, countryside heroine (Catherine) into the splendors and miseries of adulthood, Austen is here fully brimming over with her unmistakable satiric wit, charm, and astonishing worldly wisdom. Catherine, for instance, from the outset has already confounded life and art, so she is disappointed, to our delight, that on her first journey to Bath and grown-up experience, there's \\"not one lucky overturn of the carriage to introduce her to the hero.\\"   Austen's women -whether naive (Catherine) or vain and coquettish ( fashion-hungry Mrs. Allen and men-with-money-hungry Isabella Thorpe)- are all well drawn, and equally so are her men, especially the boorish John Thorpe, an early example of the \\"it's all about me\\" guy, and the triumphantly witty, hard-headed, yet kind Henry Tilney. Astonishingly, Austen concluded very early as a novelist that it's only the few genuine individuals in life who follow a civilized code of manners, whereas most other people are in fact mere conformists devoted to the fashionable ways of the world, pursuing vulgar self-interest or greed, while thinking themselves smart for doing so.  A few years back, adaptations of Austen for the screen were all the rage. \\"Northanger Abbey\\" had earlier been the subject of an inferior TV adaptation, set in the proper time period but too heavy on the Gothic \\"horror\\" element and largely witless. So far as I know it has never been made into a film. Given the continuing fondness of the young for horror novels (Stephen King's, say) and now scary movies, I'd argue \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a natural for an updated version (like \\"Clueless\\" was of \\"Emma\\") set perhaps among the young who leave home for the first time to attend college.  They too might initially expect life to resemble to some degree what they've encountered in their romances, \\"horror\\" novels and slasher films, only to be wittily disabused, but then to discover in fact the real ways life always and everywhere is actually \\"horrid,\\" that is, owing to the timeless prevalence of vanity, self-absorption, and greed.

0307165485|4.0|I went to my niece's baby shower recently, and we were asked to bring our favorite children's book for the new mom and baby.  My two sons had this book while they were growing up (they're 25 and 23 now), and it was the one they asked for the most often for bedtime stories.  The illustrations are fun, the stories are timeless, and many of them have good morals to them.  This is a fabulous gift for a new mom or a child.
0743289412|1.0|Hmmm - I originally put this review on Amazon a week ago, but it was removed.<br /><br />Just so you know, I only made it through 60 pages of Lisey's Story.<br /><br />Everything was just a little too precious, a little too full of itself, a little too irritating. King apparently thinks that he is such a great writer that he needs to constantly (and by constantly, I mean CONSTANTLY) make up his own words and phrases.<br /><br />Skrid, incuncabilla, rungut, sink-pig, suck-oven, huh-yooge... these are bad enough when used about 10 times in the first couple of chapters, but the real winner has got to be \\"smuck\\". By page 60, Ling has used his cute replacement for the \\"F-word\\" twenty times.<br /><br />This brought back memories of his earlier, pre-pubescent heroes howling \\"Whoremonger!\\" to the skies, while clinching their fists. I mean really, how many adolescents use the word whoremonger in their everyday speech?<br /><br />And, just in case you don't have enough of a brain to figure out which authors you should read, King gives shout-outs to more than ten writers by page 56. Of those, I had read Bester, Poe and Pynchon, but I would not consider any of them my favorites.<br /><br />Didn't Stephen King announce that he was retiring, four or five years ago? He must have meant the same sort of retirement that Jay-z and The Who talk about....maybe he should invent a new word for it.

B000BTC5LW|5.0|I had never seen David Gilmour or Pink Floyd.  In concert, in an interview...nothing.  I bought this DVD after hearing a local FM discjockey recommend it.  WOW!  I have always liked Pink Floyd but I really enjoyed watching them perform in concert.  One great song after another, great visual experience...super clean sound.  Their live music sounds as good (clean) as their studio stuff. <br /> <br />I love this DVD!

B000GFLE86|3.0|Madeleine Peyroux is an incredible musician. I saw her live and I was amazed at her talent, and how alive her interpretations were. But on the album it doesn't come across at all. It sounds really bad, like the album wasn't mixed properly. At first I thought someone had changed the settings on my stereo. But my other albums sound fine. There's something really weird about the sound on this album. What a shame because Madeleine is soooo good- you have to go see her live and hear these sounds as they're meant to sound.
0142001104|5.0|This book is one of the very best I  have ever read.  It has enabled me to work more effectively with people in many situations.  Situations that were obstacles  have become opportunities  for creative problem solving.  I highly recommend this book to everyone who has to interact with other people  every day.  Don't pass this book by!  This book makes a great gift.
0684859106|5.0|I've crashed and burned so many times with from-scratch frosting, and couldn't bear to get the storebought tub o-frosting one more time - so having experienced the Magnolia Bakery cupcake firsthand, I had to check out their cookbook. Chocolate buttercream frosting on basic yellow cupcakes was a huge success. Good non-intimidating recipes for the \\"weekend baker\\" - agree that they could include more photos, tho.
B0002WZTOI|5.0|Gone are the glorious days of the intense action and drama of close range air combat that this movie brings to life. Beyond visual range missiles, systems, and tactics, which the F-14 Tomcat was long respected for, has been modestly shown or underestimated, and the F-5 Tiger was called a 'MiG-28', yet Top Gun spectacularly showcased the F-14 Tomcat's agility, speed, looks, and close-range combat power all in the name of a fun, action-packed thrill ride on the edge of your seat experience of modern combat aviation that became a worldwide sensational hit as it blended the right amounts of action, drama, suspense, romance, and high-tech adventure all in one movie. This 2-disc set contains lots of extra features, interviews, behind the scenes, the making, the special effects, and the story of the people behind the movie and the aircraft that got Tom Cruise airborne on his rise to fame. A timeless yet fitting tribute to the legendary F-14's final voyage aboard an aircraft carrier on the high seas.
0812550706|5.0|I read this book first as a condensed version in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction magazine, aka Reader's Digest of sci-fi.<br /><br />The full version was very good and is a must for all military sci-fi fans. The action does lag in the middle, but the insight into Ender's thought process and the journey thru his breakdown and comeback is truly great writing.<br /><br />The wargames in zero-g are well described and intense. The characters are well thought out and believable. The twist at the end is unexpected and well done.<br /><br />The political sub-plot involving his brother and sister is tolerable and ties in nicely at the end. Wade thru it folks, it does matter.<br /><br />I plan on reading this book again soon.
6305364648|5.0|True Lies is one of the greatest action movies of all time pushing Arnold Schwarzeneger as a spy for the greatest nation on earth to be all he can be, managing to conceal his action-packed identity even from his wife for 15 years, until it was time to save her and his daughter from the very terrorists he has sworn to defeat. For the nation, he falls prisoner with his wife behind enemy lines as a CIA agent who is forced to verify the terrorists' nuclear capability much like Alias at the brink of torture but fights his way out much like Rambo with a little James Bond in fashion. Soon his whole family, including his teenage daughter, have no choice but to risk their life for the country by foiling the terrorist's plot to bring the nation down to it's knees with a nuclear threat. The family's dramatic reunion in the end is propelled by their courageous patriotism that puts an end to the terrorist threat. This movie also featured one of the greatest footage of an AV-8B Harrier in action on an urban setting, outmaneuvering a shoulder-launched surface-to-air missile from truck-bound terrorists, then firing a pair of AGM-65 Maverick Missiles that destroys the bridge highway under the pair of trucks used by terrorists and later flown by Arnold to fire an AIM-9L Sidewinder Missile at a terrorist-packed helicopter, with the terrorist leader hilariously caught on the tip of the missile, going through the wide open hole blasted open earlier by the Harrier when it shredded other terrorist members with it's 20mm machine guns as Arnold hovered up to one of the top floors where they've set up camp where his daughter was held hostage who later escapes with the detonation key and also resists by all means she can. A timeless action-packed adventure indeed for the mind, body and soul. This is one of those great all-in-one movies that have it all--action, comedy, drama, suspense, high-tech gear, adventure, great inspiring characters, great mind-boggling story, and more, all in one movie!
B000002I6V|5.0|I hadn't listened to this in about twenty five years; of course that was on vynal! It's still wonderful...a true work of art!
B000E1JOSE|4.0|Black and White Night is an outstanding tribute to the legacy of Roy Orbison and will provode a lifetime of music to any Orbison fan.  His music is assisted by some of the greatest artists you could gather in one band.  Bonnie Raitt, Bruce Springsteen, Tom Waits, Elvis Costello, and Jackson Browne are to name but a few of them.  I would highly recommend this CD to anyone that ever tapped their feet to Orbison's music.

0786860707|1.0|I bought this book and opened it thinking that it wil be the strong version of The Animator Survival Kit, then after just 5 minutes I realized that it was a serial loose of my money because it not worth the money I paid. It has nothing that helps you to animate , is just the story of some Disney old animated movies. And the rest of it is to read a full scale of bla, bla, bla, bla that don't help in anything. But if you are a collector of Disney old stories it will be ok, so before buy it just think if you wanna draw to animate or just collect a big & heavy book with a Disney name on it.
B000HCO83Q|1.0|Brett Ratner screwed up with this movie. If Bryan Singer had stayed with X-Men instead of moving to the horrible Superman movie, it would have been better. And who gave Ratner the right to bring X-Men to an end. I can say a whole list of things wrong with this movie. First off, Professor Xavier and Cyclops die. That's not supposed to happen. Beast was only in this one, so technically he was only in one X-Men of the whole series even if he is a major character in the X-Men series. All in all, this movie was a complete failure with to much CGI. Don't leave any comic book movies to Brett Ratner.
0783229364|3.0|no, not an academy award winner, but it was fun to watch, and it was light but fun entertainment. If you want serious, just wake up in the morning and live life. Othewise take a break with this movie, and just don't take it seriously.
B000003TA4|5.0|This cd absolutely, 100%  lives up to it's hype.<br /><br />Not only does it have a collection of great, dynamic, and energetic songs but, it also was pivotal in it's release.<br /><br />Just as \\"Never Mind the Bollock's, Here's the Sex Pistols\\" did in the 1970's, \\"Nevermind\\" did for the 1990's.<br /><br />This changed the landscape of music.<br /><br />\\"Nevermind\\" is essential listening in the history of rock and roll.<br /><br />Cobain  killing himself even made the work that much more monumental.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Friends told me this was funny, but I could not find the point to this movie.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Despite the gore, the violence, the intense surround-sound or its equivalent, this film had me spellbound from start to finish. Jack Nicholson is brilliant -- seems to have lots of fun being an arch villain; and DiCaprio/Damon seem to be opposite sides of the same coin. Plot twists and drama holds up to the very last frame. I absolutely loved this film, loved the games played with classic country and modern day rap -- all told, I'd like to see it once more in the theatre to be sure I haven't zipped past the nuance and just focused on the meat and potatoes. Oh -- there wasn't a performance I didn't like -- and that includes actors whom I generally prefer not to see -- in this case, a less than engaging Mark Wahlberg. If you can get past the gore, go and enjoy. I hope Scorsese is awarded an Oscar for this one.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I agree with many of the reviewers, this CD has obvious influences without being a redux....it sounds fresh and original, hard and absolutely amazing. It's going to be considered a classic in the vein that many are referencing, which I'll skip. If you liked their earlier stuff this will appeal to you and you'll appreciate the maturity and evolution that MCR has experienced. A new favorite and a complete album from start to finish, and I'm difficult to impress.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|A fabulous production. Almost as good as the stage show. I would greatly recommend it to anyone who loves the West End
B0001DI0FI|5.0|An outstanding collector's edition with an excellent documentary on the making of the film.  Highly recommended for purchase.
B000A59PMO|5.0|Veronica mars is one of the best TV shows around... great storylines, awesome characters and the one liners will have you on the edge of your seat.  This show incorporates the drama of high school, romances up's and downs and the bond between father and daughter.   <br />Start watching it today and I bet you will be hooked by the end of the first episode.  <br />
0790729393|5.0|This is one of my favourite movie ever along with IT(stephen king movie) and The Shawshank Redemption. <br />This movie is a master piece revealing the truth of Juvenile prisons along with other places where people in power (police, government...) takes control of normal people.  <br />It's about sexual harrasment of young children who grow up to revenge their childhood.  <br />I rate this movie as 150% master piece with the best performance of all the actors and actresses. <br />
B0002STNQ2|2.0|The story starts out with a lot of promise, which is why it's so disappointing when you get to the preposterously dopey ending. I won't give too much away, but the ending is like something out of a 1930's B-movie. There are so many ways this could have been done that would have been infinitely more plausible (for example, see Richard Morgan's handling of similar issues in a subplot of Broken Angels). I was literally angry as I got to end of the book because it was such a letdown--I was listening to the audiobook version in the car and was actually shouting at the CD player as the ending unfolded. <br /> <br />Hard to believe this is from the same author that gave us The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park. Unless you're *really* good at suspending disbelief, avoid this one.
6305428298|4.0|This little gem of movie often gets overlooked by Americans.  The star is the same woman who plays the ditzy secretary, Bubble, on AB FAB.  Her voice is so incredible at first I did not believe it was \\"Bubble\\" doing the singing.  Great story, don't miss this one.
0743454537|3.0|This is a very sad and difficult book to read.  To have a child as a spare part for the older ill child.  I did not enjoy this book.  The parents had no redeeming qualities.  They forgot about the younger daughter except for what she could do for her older sister.  It is a very scary book.
B000HCO83Q|5.0|As one that doesn't have the knowledge of the characters via the comic book, I think that I look at each X-Men film with a less-biased eye.  That having been said, I find the third installment to be the most entertaining of the lot - and that's some praise from one that thought the second film was excellent.<br /><br />This time out, there are so many characters (mutant and human) that it was obvious that some of the returning characters, like Anna Paquin (Rogue) and James Marsden (Cyclops) would have less screen time.  It is also obvious that Jackman, Berry, and McKellan are the stars, with Stewart doing nothing more than a \\"death scene\\" cameo.  As others have stated, Kelsey Grammer steals the show as \\"Beast,\\" with Vinnie Jones running a close second as \\"Juggernaut\\".<br /><br />It's also good to see stage, screen, and television Michael Murphy in the role of Warren Worthington II, creator of the \\"cure\\" for the mutant gene.<br /><br />The dialogue is equal to the second and superior to the first.  Special effects are outstanding, especially of Magneto shifting The Golden Gate Bridge and Dark Phoenix's (Famke Janssen) assault on Alcatraz in San Francisco Bay.<br /><br />The action is crisp and each actor does get his/her \\"moment,\\" no matter how brief.<br /><br />There are a few complaints: the absence of Jim Cummings' marvelous \\"Nightcrawler\\" and the beautiful Rebecca Romijn's early departure from the story line.  Both actors deserved better than this, after their impressive turns in the first two films.<br /><br />Also, the inevitable battle between \\"Ice Man\\" (Shawn Ashmore) and \\"Pyro\\" (Aaron Stafford) was a bit of a letdown, lasting less than a minute, in my estimate.<br /><br />That withstanding, if in fact this is the last in the series (save a Wolverine franchise), it still delivers and all that had a hand in its production have much for which they can be proud.
B000BNI90O|5.0|Ottimo prodotto. Sono soldi veramente spesi bene. Su un unico DVD c'è tutta, ma proprio tutta, la colonna sonora del film. Speriamo che escano anche gli altri due cofanetti.
0783225482|5.0|A must have for any movie collector or fan of any of these actors. This movie might not be manufactured in the near future so get it asap. The price is right and the movie is a keeper. The movie was before it's time as it mocks Hollywood and the lifesyles of the rich and/or famous. What would you do to stay on top? How much would you pay if you knew the hidden answer? Watch and find out for 10-12 bucks!!!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|This is a great addition to my collection.  I travel a lot and Home sings my feelings whenever I am away.  The rest of the album sets the mood for easy times and helps overcome a tough day.
0743289412|5.0|I enjoyed reading \\"Lisey's Story\\". Im so used to reading novels that are more or less mapped out for me in the first 50 pages. However, with Liseys Story, you have to connect the dots and keep on reading. This story has it all, horror, romance, mystery, suspense, supernatural... <br />Kings writing is beautiful and well crafted. The story is complex and inventive. I loved the journey and I was definitely entertained!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I recall READING about Dr Who's adventures when I was a kid. That was about 14 years ago. I vaguely recall his travelling phone booth and the invasion of the Daleks. I sketched little Daleks all over my textbooks and I think my cousins whom got the books passed down didn't know what the hell they were. Hearing about the BBC's new take of the Doctor made me want to watch it. I didn't watch the older series (as mentioned, only read the books) but I heard nothing but good things about this new series and decided to try it out. It took a while (a short while) to get used to it. But I must say that I'm a fan again. Although the buildup of the entire series was great (my girlfriend particularly liked the episode with Rose's dad), the final episode with... well. The ENDING of the series didn't really go that well with me. Kinda silly. But I had a great ride. For those that are worried that Dr Who might be foreign or even alien to them, you don't have to. My girlfriend loved it and my friends whom I've passed the discs around all love it too. It will grow on you and after that, you'll just want to continue each and every episode until the end. Check out the interesting special features too, behind the scenes documentary by Rose regarding life on the set. BBC's done it right and the only sad thing I must say (other than the lacklustre ending) is that they had to change the Doctor in season 2. I can't judge the new Doctor as I don't get the show over here in Singapore, but after watching Season 1, I hate to see the change. Overall, a fantastic series and well worth the time and money. The rest of the episodes more than make up for the ending. So do check it out. Great price too. Bloody expensive in HMV Singapore.
0385338694|5.0|Fantastic, fantastic, fantastic. I bought this book to read on a flight from the UK to Australia and it had me laughing so loud I was quite an embarrassment! I'm not a 'chick lit' kind of girl but this was a real exception. As an author myself I really admire the talent it takes to write a book where almost every line makes you smile or laugh. Pure escapism, very charming and such good fun, and somehow it also manages to be a book which makes you take stock of what really counts in life. This should be compulsory reading for every workaholic - and certainly every lawyer. Enjoy!
B000G73UEU|5.0|There are some magnificent, some great and some merely competent interpretations of Leonard Cohen's music on this soundtrack album. First the highlights. Tower Of Song by Martha Wainwright with its intricate guitars is a powerful interpretation of the classic. The lilting and sensual Tonight Will Be Fine by Teddy Thompsom is magnificent - his voice resembles that of Springsteen.<br /><br />Then comes the tremulous and atmospheric Winter Lady by [[ASIN:B0000000JY Kate & Anna McGarrigle]] and Martha Wainwright, a true gem. Beth Orton does a splendid version of Sisters Of Mercy with her slow and emphatic enunciation supported by lovely backing vocals. Perla Batalla's Bird On A Wire and [[ASIN:B0012GMX3S The Traitor]] by Martha Wainwright with its opening trumpets are great, and both have exquisite instrumentation.<br /><br />The weaving voices of Nick Cave, Julie Christensen and Perla Batalla make Suzanne quite special, whilst Teddy Thompson does justice to [[ASIN:B0012GMVDK The Future]] in this rhythmic, uptempo version of the eerie song with its apocalyptic vision of the future. The evocative Anthem is a duet between Batalla and Christensen, a classic interpretation with soulful organ and uplifting vocals.<br /><br />I found the following tracks competent but not really exceptional: The sax-heavy I'm Your Man by Nick Cave, [[ASIN:B0012GMZKE Chelsea Hotel]] by Rufus Wainwright, the soulful If It Be Your Will by Antony, I Can't Forget by Jarvis Cocker, Famous Blue Raincoat by the Handsome Family and the breezy Everybody Knows by Rufus Wainwright.<br /><br />Although not a fan of U2, I love the concluding track  Tower of Song by Cohen and Bono. The voices work well together and the instrumentation is superb.  Fans of Leonard might also be interested in the other tribute albums: [[ASIN:B000OPO6WY Famous Blue Raincoat: 20th Anniversary Edition]] by Jennifer Warnes, [[ASIN:B0002M5TE8 Judy Collins Sings Leonard Cohen: Democracy]], [[ASIN:B000002ISX I'm Your Fan]] by a colourful array of artists from different musical backgrounds and the slightly tepid [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen]] by a selection of mostly country singers.ferent musical backgrounds and the slightly tepid [[ASIN:B000001EZK Tower of Song: The Songs of Leonard Cohen]] by a selection of mostly country singers.
0553804677|5.0|One of the most entertaining, unique, and well-written books I've read in ages - it's hard to believe that The Lies of Locke Lamora is Scott Lynch's first novel.  Locke manages to be both a sympathetic character and an unabashedly underhanded con-man at the same time, and he and his band of Gentleman are ferociously entertaining to follow.  The plot is complex, the actions at time very graphic and brutal (wee ones had best not read much about things like the Teeth Show): but violence is never thrown in with a kind of sophomoric glee, but taken as a fact of life in what is a very dangerous city.  Lynch makes liberal use of flashbacks, but oddly enough, his use of the trope doesn't dilute or slow down the action of the novel, but adds a heightened sense of urgency to the rest of the novel's events, and puts in background information where it is most pertinent to the plot.<br /><br />There's so much more to say about this novel - but I'll simply state that if you even REMOTELY enjoy good fiction (fantasy in particular, but not exclusively), you should very seriously consider picking this one up.  Heck - stop reading this and just buy it already!

0380799006|5.0|This is a great book.  I have twin boys who are almost two and I bought this book to help better understand sibling relationships and rivalries.  Althought I can't quite use all the techniques described just yet, I know that I will use this in the years to come.

B000007PSR|5.0|This is the album that exposes the side of Syd barrett we all were so curiuos to experience for so long. Although to the average listener, it may not be fit for mainstream. The ideas and innovations can be heard in this album, sometimes sad reminding us what could have been. Although they are mainly outtakes, and one most remember that or he sounds even more out of it than he really is, which is saying a lot. It's great for the true Syd Barrett fans that wanted more after the last two albums finished up by Gilmore and friends. I know Syd barrett was a genious clouded by insanity. This album is very raw, and allows you to hear that, but also sad knowing that he is in there but unable to perfect his gift enough to make it totally comprehensible. Fives stars for the Syd barrett fans, but if your looking for Pink Floyd, it's not here, sorry to say.

0307155102|5.0|This is the best book to use with your child who is developing in language acquisition. I sat with both my 9-24 month old children pointing to the pictures and telling them what the picture was. I was fun to watch them point to a bus, school bus etc. and even though they might not yet be able to say the words, you could tell they recognized the actual object.
6305511055|4.0|Excellent movie but felt disappointed with cinemascope. Distracting with wide black areas above and below screenshots. <br />Otherwise would recommend.
6305807930|3.0|In the wake of \\"Suspiria\\", where Dario Argento fully committed to the visual and aesthetic possibilities of the horror genre, narrative took a back seat. Gone were the days of the tightly plotted whodunits such as \\"Bird with the Crystal Plumage\\" and \\"Deep Red\\". \\"Inferno\\" is symptomatic of a cinematic approach in which narrative is subservient to and in service to increasingly grand visual set pieces. \\"Inferno\\" more so than any horror film marked the eventual path the genre would take in the 1980's. \\"Inferno\\" isn't however devoid of narrative, but making sense of it is not the paramount concern of the spectator. The theme of alchemy acts as an effective metaphor for the film as whole, as Argento throws in tried and tested ingredients to create something that is startlingly dark and baroque. \\"Inferno's\\" narrative problems however are not it's undoing, it's as if Argento realises by the very nature of the genre that his major concern is the realisation of another world; in this case a gloomy and gothic netherworld in which the forces of evil are much closer than one expects. Full of spectacular and senseless violence \\"Inferno\\" reconstitutes the gothic form (made quaint and redundant by Hammer) and gives it a unique Italian sensibility.

B000002U8G|5.0|What the hell do I mean by redeemed insanity? There is certain music out there that can lead you (if you let yourself be led, and circumstances are right) to the very edge of \\"sanity.\\" Echoes on Pink Floyd's Meddle is the best example of this that I know of. The best part is coming back. <br /> <br />Strap on your headphones. Close your eyes. And hold on to your seat. PF Echoes will take your hand and walk you through a breezy summer afternoon & a feel-good heavy funk party with amazing solos. But then night falls and it's dark. Really dark. And there's some sort of bird howling at you, almost begging for help. But you can't do anything. And then you realize they left you out here alone in the pitch black with nothing but this, the albatross crying in the night. And you wonder if they'll ever come back. You wonder how they'll ever come back for several long minutes. And all of a sudden there is a glimmer of musical light in the darkness. You hold on to this. And wait. Finally, you can see day begin to break. As the sun rises the music becomes more lush and beautiful. Everything is OK. <br /> <br />I have heard all of Floyd's catalog umpteen times. This album is the one. This album has Echoes, which I believe is thier greatest work. Period. If anyone can make thier guitar \\"talk,\\" it's Gilmour. Just absolutley mind-blowing! <br /> <br />If you're a fan I cannot recommend enough the video \\"Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii\\" if you can get your hands on it. They actually played a colloseum at the ruins of Pompeii. With no audience. It's indescribable.
B000069HZP|5.0|My wife and I have watched this amazing movie over a dozen times over the years -- on first watch it is very good, very entertaining -- on subsequent viewings it actually continues to get better.

B00002E224|2.0|Richard (Artsy) Linklater, poet laureate of Gen-Nexters, is the kind of director who could be great - if he wasn't so lousy.  He has a refreshing desire to take risks, defy convention, and flat out ignore devices that have served storytellers for millennia.  In Tape he locked three people in a room and held them hostage, along with the audience.  In Waking Life he merged morphing animation with stream of conscious dialogue to create a dream within a dream within a college freshman's philosophy term paper.  In Before Sunrise he shows us a brief encounter, (characterized by the inappropriate illusion of intimacy frequently experienced when traveling), during which absolutely nothing happens.<br /><br />Failure is commonplace, failing magnificently requires courage.<br /><br />There are good things to say about Before Sunrise.  Vienna looks lovely.  Celine, Julie Delpy, looks equally lovely, and acts her part, what there is of it, beautifully.  The film is replete with attractive train and trolley shots and even re-uses the marvelous Ferris wheel made famous in The Third Man, (a movie that actually had a plot).  The Austrians on the bridge are funny, and the \\"milkshake\\" poem was wonderful.<br /><br />Things crash quickly after that.  Even the colorful street scenes, palm reader, belly dancing, etc. look blatantly staged, you can almost see the grips and gaffers stringing cables one foot out of the shots.  Ethan Hawke needs to be told that his scruff does not give him that cool, dangerous Trotsky affect; it just makes him look like he sleeps in a culvert.  Though his acting is workmanlike, he was the wrong choice for a film that depends entirely on the glossy superficiality and shared insanity of romance.<br /><br />When two people speak and listen to each other, that's called a conversation.  When interesting, well-developed characters talk to each other and do things to each other, thereby revealing themselves and being changed in the process, (and there's a cameraman on hand), that's called a movie.<br /><br />When two-dimensional characters talk endlessly about whatever in a way that accomplishes nothing and only serves to explore the full extent of their two-dimensionality, that's called a Richard Linklater movie.ie.    When two-dimensional characters talk endlessly about whatever in a way that accomplishes nothing and only serves to explore the full extent of their two-dimensionality, that's called a Richard Linklater movie.

0375703764|3.0|At the core of this multi-layered, zillion-page novel is a scary story about a  filmmaker/photographer father and his family who move into a house which is mysteriously larger inside than it is outside.  The house keeps changing; mysterious new hallways lead to vast, seemingly endless interior spaces haunted by some unseen but obviously malevolent entity.  As in a typical Stephen King novel, the supernatural threat either echoes or intensifies the family's troubled pyschological dynamic. <br /> <br />This basic story is told in the form of a mock-academic treatise, ridiculously heavily footnoted, whose subject is the father's documentary film about his family's horrific ordeal in the house.  This treatise has been found -- as a badly damaged, disordered manuscript -- in the apartment of a mysterious blind recluse who has recently died in Los Angeles.  The text is laboriously reconstructed by a tattoo artist's assistant, a friend of a neighbor of the old man -- and the task drives him to the brink of madness and death.  The tattoo artist's account of his downward spiral (accompanied by a fair amount of weird, drug-addled sex with strange women) frames the text of the treatise and includes interminable footnotes of his own (sometimes there are footnotes on footnotes).   <br /> <br />It's tempting to dismiss this book as confusing, irritating and unoriginal -- its obvious antecedents include Vladimir Nabokov's \\"Pale Fire,\\" written  50 years ago or so, and Lawrence Sterne's hilarious \\"Tristram Shandy,\\" written in the 18th Century and yet as boldly experimental and self-consciously bizarre as anything published in our own time (e.g., there's one page which is solid black).  In the current book, the mock-academic element -- hundreds of quotations and footnoted references to other works, some of which are undoubtedly to real books and articles -- got particularly tiresome, I thought.  There are also strange manipulations of the text -- pages with one line or one word, textoddly arranged on some pages, the word \\"house\\" always printed in blue ink, etc. -- which as far as I could see serve no great purpose.  But maybe I just don't get it. <br /> <br />Still, I have to admit that I kept reading.  However irritating, the book kept me hooked.  On the other hand -- to my surprise -- I haven't found myself thinking much about it since finishing.  It apparently didn't leave much of a lasting impression.  On one level at least, the book is about a confrontation with some elemental, deeply malevolent force or entity which destroys or almost destroys the three author/narrator figures -- the filmmaker, the blind recluse and the tattoo artist's assistant (each of the three is already psychologically damaged by events in his past, and perhaps this is what makes each vulnerable to the entity's assault), but I came away without really understanding the nature of this entity. <br /> <br />The bottom line is that I'd be tempted to recommend this book to a friend, so that after he or she read it I could ask whether he or she was more impressed than I'd been and if so why.  I don't think I'd recommend it to a stranger.  Instead, I'd say read \\"Tristram Shandy\\" or \\"Pale Fire\\" -- cleverly constructed metafictional enterprises which I KNOW are genuinely good. <br />

0385513755|5.0|I first read the original Da Vinci Code some years ago, and loved it. However, I found myself having to stop reading to go on the i-net and look up the paintings and structures that were featured in the story. When someone told me they had an illustrated version, I was ecstatic. I re-read the book, and must say that it is an entirely different experience (and adventure!) reading this. If you loved the Da Vinci Code there's no way you'll dislike the illustrated version.<br /><br />Additionally, Amazon sells it MUCH cheaper than retail book stores!
B000002ITW|4.0|He's an old hippie<br />and he don't know what to do<br />should he hang on to the old<br />should he grab on to the new...(as the country song goes)<br />I can't believe how many reviewers have dissed this set on the reason that it sounds dated, or you can't go home again, or nostalgia it ain't.<br />Buy it because you like the music! And the music here, especially the acoustic stuff, is excellent. My favorite tunes on this set (back then as well as today) are Neil Young's. 'Don't Let It Bring You Down' still brings a tear to my eye, and this version of 'Cowgirl In the Sand' is so much better than the studio version.<br />Now, add to that an awesome acoustical \\"extra\\" medley of 'Down By the River,' 'Cinnamon Girl,' and 'The Loner' - all, once again superior to the studio electrical versions - and you have one heck of a disc!<br />But, that's not all (as the old TV ads used to say), you also have gems from Graham Nash ('Right Between the Eyes' and the tune dedicated to Mayor Daley - 'Chicago'), plus 'Triad', 'Teach Your Children' and on and on.<br />Tell me this isn't great stuff!<br />My reason for a 4 instead of a 5? Well, why not add the full version of 'Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' left off the original?<br />Also, the electrical disc is fair...I didn't play the second album of the hard stuff that often when I originally purchased this back in the '70's anyhow.<br />'Carry On' is not too bad, 'Ohio' is great, and 'Southern Man' is so-so.<br />But, the last tune, 'Find the Cost of Freedom' is acoustic once again, and it sounds wonderful.<br />All in all, this is a very good disc. Don't buy it to relive your youth. Get it because you enjoy the music.<br />Well worth the money.
B000GCFO08|5.0|I did not have many expectations when this came out as a movie but was pleasantly surprised! The dvd was a must own as soon as it came out.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|I had heard good reviews about this film and quite often this leads to let down upon viewing but I am happy to say that this was not one of those times.  The writing is slick and humorous and the acting is great all round.  This film is clever and different and overall a good break from a lot of the junk we've been subjected to lately.  Whilst not one of those films you would \\"rave\\" about, it is very entertaining and definately worth a look.
B000002O5L|4.0|Unlike most of the other reviewers, I didn't think this album was 100% gold.  In fact, it seemed to me the album (side A) started out with the strongest material (the three big singles are all in the first 5 songs) and then it went downhill for me. Overall, side B was kind of bla for me, and sounded rather unfinished (notice the average song on side A is much longer than side B, and Mike Campbell's contributions are all on side A).  There wasn't much guitar work, maybe owing to the fact that this was more a solo effort, and songs like \\"A Mind With a Heart of Its Own\\" and \\"Zombie Zoo\\" replace Mike Campbell's guitars with organs and excessive backing vocals. \\"Alright for Now\\" is a really short lullabye that never really goes anywhere, stays in the lull it begins with and has some pretty uninspired lyrics. \\"Depending on You\\" and \\"The Apartment Song\\" are the same for the entire song and has the same drums and guitars the whole way through and are very repetitive, along with \\"A Mind With a Heart of its Own.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, the strong points of this album make it worth getting, but if you already have \\"Anthology\\" you have every really good song on this album.  Personally, although I thought the follow-up \\"Into the Great Wide Open\\" did not have as many really strong tracks, it was more consistent overall and had the catchy riffs which would have made up for what is lacking here.  Clearly he developed a new style on this record and an ability to not take himself so seriously, but I just thought side B left a lot to be desired and each song kind of ended where it started staying the same throughout with some very throwaway lyrics (\\"I'm all right. I just feel a little lonely tonight. I'm OK most of the time.  I just feel a little lonely tonight\\").<br /><br />Check out \\"Echo\\" and the soundtrack to \\"She's the One\\" for some of TP's most underrated work, this I would say is a tad overrated.
B000HT386M|1.0|I had heard that this film was \\"really funny\\" and \\"worth watching\\".  I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan but I am a fan of Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken.  I was sorely disappointed with this film.  The audience can't relate to the main character at first because he is just down right irritating.  I was hoping that the gags would get funnier but they didn't.  I also found most of the film rather depressing as we watch the main characters life being slowly destroyed around him.  Overall Click was ok, Kate Beckinsale looked beautiful as usual but even that was not enough to save it.  I would NOT recommend buying this film.
B00005MP58|5.0|Never have I seen something on the screen that was as worth watching as the book from which it came was worth reading. Jane Austen would be proud of this television adaptation of her novel. Each character is portrayed superbly and the plot unfolds in a wonderful way. I have watched this over and over and am entertained each time. There is a depth to the performances that one can savor. Jennifer Ehle is the consumate Lizzy and Colion Firth was born to be Mr. Darcy (whose given name is Fitzwilliam, by the way!)
0783117523|5.0|I really liked this movie. It told a story about a women that not a whole lot of people knew about. It's a story about a women who came from nothing to being everything she ever wanted. She had to deal with the up sand downs of stardom, and eventaully got stuck on the downs. Its a great story.

0895260131|5.0|This book was absolutely excellent.  From the moment I picked it up, I could hardly put it down.  Very smooth reading, easy to follow, great for the layman or the casual scholar, with tons of suggestions for more in-depth reading.  Tells you all sorts of facts, backed up with data and citation, that you'd never know sticking with the mainstream media.  Excellent resource and highly recommended to anyone interested in Islam, particularly in a day and age when knowledge of our enemy is a MUST!

0385474547|5.0|What a fantastic novel! I read this book for a graduate class and thought it was nothing short of spectacular. What I find interesting is that Achebe's book is taught to freshmen at the high school I work at and the majority of the students I have talked to find it unremarkable. This is what follows when one fails to read into the complexities that are imbedded in (what could be construed as) a simply written text.<br />This novel is not only a cautionary tale on the dangers of hubris, but a reiteration of the devastation brought on to \\"more primitive\\" cultures by the imperial (white) powers. Of course, the context of this novel could easily be superimposed onto current times in its ability to show the need for a more dominant culture to force its value system in a place where a people have gotten along just fine without it.<br />I am very, very glad I read this book and I certainly plan to read more of Achebe's work in the future. I think there are infinite wisdoms to be gained by reading such an obviously insightful author. What's more, this book is a page turner in every sense of the word--it is inherently didactic and wildly entertaining simultaneously. I ask you, what more could a reader want?
B00005JPBP|4.0|Ignore the star power in this movie, if you can. Michael Caine, David Bowie, Christian Bale, Piper Perabo, Hugh Jackman, and Scarlett Johansson are hard to ignore, but try anyway. Also, ignore the low-key action of the movie, until you can't any more. This is about aggression that goes way beyond any normal violence. Even without the supernatural, these people can't be stopped by mere murder - or suicide.<br /><br />I can't say much, because almost anything would be a spoiler. When you get to the last scene, all you'll want is to see the rest all over again. It really does build up, moment by moment, in an utterly logical progression that conceals its logic. There is one deus ex machina at work, but only one. The rest seems inevitable, but only when you look back from the very end.<br /><br />It's intense, and just scratches the surface of a rage that gentle people will not understand. It builds slowly - I almost walked out about an hour into it. It finishes hard and fast, though. It reminds me of \\"Realm of the Senses,\\" not in its sensuality, but in its cold, hard drive for revenge.<br /><br />//wiredweird

B00006IU73|5.0|\\"In Absentia\\" is Porcupine Tree's pinnacle of progressive rock before they made the change for a more metal sound for the album \\"Deadwing\\". Continually improving from their early space rock origins (and Wilson's solidarity) Porcupine Tree have created quite a repertoire of albums.  <br /> <br />\\"In Absentia\\" is a concept album about mental illness (omitting the tracks \\"The Sound of Musak\\" and \\"Wedding Nails\\"). Many consider it to be their best album, which I agree with to a certain extent. All of the songs have heartbreaking melodies and riffs that will blow you away. The only track I dislike on the entire album is \\"Lips of Ashes\\" as it leaves the climax of \\"Trains\\" unused. It just doesn't seem to fit in its current place, but its not enough to make me not listen to it. <br /> <br />Porcupine Tree new-comers should try this album as it is one of their most accessible albums, but should also try the previous \\"Lightbulb Sun\\".

076790592X|1.0|I should know by now that anything Oprah spotlights will be fluff with a healthy dose of dimestore philosophy.  But this tome pegs the Kumbayaometer.  I don't know what was worse, Morrie's trite, Godless, and lapsed-Jewish advice to \\"be nice to those we love\\" or Mitch Albom's profiteering off a friend's gruesome ALS death. What is it with America that we flock to this shallow I'm okay-You're okay amoral clap-trap and treat it as profundity?  Is it because it excuses all our immoral behavior and builds our self-esteem which is the real god of this age? As a sidebar, what is it with Oprah and her ilk?  That a woman of questionable morals who shacks up without marriage and supports abortion on demand is held up as a moral compass for so many escapes all thoughtful logic.  Safe to say, anything written by the tirelessly self-promoting Albom should be avoided and anything The Big O pushes should be rejected out of hand. By the way, I read this drivel in a Barnes and Noble while I waited for a phone call one afternoon.  If you must read it, get it at a library and keep the money from getting to Mitch.

I say \\"was\\" because just looking at the concert footage of the orginal members in all their glory, now makes me sad to see what KISS has become.  They will never be at this glory again.  I don't know what happened along the way to Gene and Paul, oh yeah its called \\"GREED\\".  I will always love the old KISS, but never will I support the current Paul and Gene show.

At this stage in my life, \\"Wouldn't Want to be like You\\" is an anthem toward corporate greed.  Whether Alan Parsons intended it that way or not is superficial to me.  Good clean recording.  I'm probably going to go after all the other APP cds now.  This was the god (thats God with a little g ) of studio groups in the late 70's to the 80's.  The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5 is that, like so many others that made the transition from vinyl, it's just to darned short a recording.  Oh well...

1878424319|1.0|In his book, The Four Agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz, embodies four principles for experiencing personal freedom in life.  He says that we should be impeccable with our words, not to take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and to always do our best. The basis for some of the agreements we make with ourselves stem from early childhood training through a series of rewards and punishments from our parents.  He calls this process \\"domestication\\" (p. 6). Ruiz says that 95% of the beliefs we hold are nothing but lies and that most of our agreements are based upon the fear of rejection.  The agreements that he gives are meant to free us from the emotional bonds that get in the way of our personal energy and to transform our lives.<br /><br />While there are various nuggets of truth throughout the book, some of it goes off into the abyss where he takes a thought and carries it to what I would consider to be to be an illogical conclusion. In some instances he uses biblical scripture to support his claims; however, in looking further, he takes some of the passages from the Bible out of context.  Some of his ideas are presented as if they were new ideas, but I would think most of us by a young age, should already have an understanding of these principles. Although his book has been highly rated, I hold the position that Mr. Ruiz lacks credibility and logic as a writer, therefore, losing good standing with me as a reader.<br /><br />According to Ruiz, as children we are not given the opportunity to choose our own beliefs.  When we go against the rules we are punished (or rewarded for compliance). The fear of rejection leads us to agree with, or become something that we are not. In essence, we become a carbon copy of someone else, such as our parents.  He says our normal tendencies are lost and we judge other people based upon these agreements.  He boldly states, lacking statistical data to back it up, that 95% of our beliefs are based upon a lie (13).<br /><br />The implication is that we are merely nothing more than a society of mindless, \\"domesticated\\" individuals, hurting ourselves, judging and victimizing other people along the way.  This kind of thinking negates the teachings associated with parenthood and the positive aspects they bring to our lives. By his interpretation, if 95% of what we believe is a lie, then 95% of what our parents taught us is also a lie.  I would disagree.  There are many people who exist today as viable, productive members of society who I'm sure would point out they too became a copy of someone else's beliefs and values.  If these role models are only filling our heads with lies and teaching us how not to be ourselves, by his interpretation, we don't need parents, teachers, or leaders. He undermines our personal paradigms and omits that as adults we do have the ability to choose a different path, which I believe is our right of passage. By his rational we lose the ability to choose our own destiny.  Instead, we become victims of it.<br /><br />One of the few things we agree upon is his first agreement, be impeccable with your word; however, he misquotes the bible (John 1:1) when he says \\"In the beginning was the word and the word was with God, and the word was God.\\"  He uses it to epitomize the use of \\"word\\" as in what one speaks (26).  Looking a little further down in that passage, it also says \\"The word was made flesh and dwelt among us\\".  This passage is not talking about a form of speech, or speaking, but rather \\"Jesus Christ\\".  Christ became flesh and dwelt among us.  In that same chapter he says that \\"sin begins with rejection of yourself\\" (31).  However, in Christianity it says that sin is a transgression of the law (1 John 3:4) and that sin is neglecting to do God's will (James 4:7).  It's not about self, but about disobeying God's ordinances. While I agree that watching what we say is something we all need to strive for, this is not a new concept.  Most children have learned by the age of 6that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.<br /><br />In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you. While this is true to some degree, he leads the reader down a path of illogical extremes when he says that even if someone took a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.  So in essence, when Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot by Amy Fisher, her expression of displeasure regarding Amy's behavior was nothing more than a fundamental form of projection because according to Ruiz \\"you are dealing with yourself, not me\\" (51).  No, realistically, Mary Jo Buttafuoco was shot because Amy Fisher wanted her dead. This kind of logic encourages victims to remain in dysfunctional relationships and perpetrators to continue abusing victims.  As an American, I'm glad that someone took 9/11 personally.<br /><br />According to Mr. Ruiz he takes neither destructive nor constructive criticism.  It seems arrogant to place myself so far above reproach, that I would turn a deaf ear to all forms of criticism.  When my College writing professor, gave me his opinion regarding my work, if I were following the authors line of reasoning, I would believe that my professor was \\"trying to poison my mind and was feeding me his emotional garbage\\" as Mr. Ruiz suggests (49). I would rather believe that my instructor has my best interests at heart and is seeking to teach me how to become a better writer.<br /><br />Another agreement is about not making assumptions in life.  He says when we make assumptions, in essence, we create unnecessary drama.  Unfortunately we live in a world where that is not entirely possible.  Assumption is a necessary part of a thought and reason; even within the scientific community a hypothesis (or assumption) is formed in order to test a theory.  In order come to school each day I must make assumptions that my instructor has a college degree, and that he or she must be reliable enough in life to make it to work everyday.<br /><br />In his forth agreement, always do your best, he claims it is based upon the actions of the other three agreements, stating they will only work if you do your best.  Again, these are fundamental principles that almost any child has learned.<br /><br />While Ruiz does indeed present some viable ideas, his concepts begin to unravel when he doesn't back up his statements with facts, but instead takes a basic concept and follows an illogical line of reasoning to reach his final conclusion.  I can't completely discount everything that he says, but he lost credibility with me by some of his assumptions and weak rationalizations.that if you don't have something nice to say, don't say it at all.<br /><br />In his second agreement, don't take anything personally; he says that nothing people do is because of you.

B000FQ4M58|4.0|It's been about 13 years since the release of the second chapter of Meat Loaf's globally-acclaimed rock-operatic masterpiece, and this chapter's about as unexpected as the last one.  In fact, a couple of my co-workers and I saw the commercial for the release of Chapter III last week, and collectively responded with \\"No WAY!\\"  (Of course, I was the only one who was actually excited about it; the others' responses were laced with sarcasm...) <br /> <br />Obviously, for those who love cheesy rock-opera (like me), this is a long-awaited slice of dripping apple pie.  With extra cheese.  If it was possible to go any more over-the-top than the uber-dramatic \\"Bat Out of Hell II\\", then Jim Steinman and Desmond Child have accomplished it.  From the opening title track, orchestra, choir, and cathedral organ permeate the rock even more on this album than the Mighty Meat's last effort, in some cases a little too much so.  The most notable evidence appears on the most epic and longest of the tracks (\\"Seize the Night\\").  The producer tandem even saw fit to twist a modified version of the Roman Catholic classic hymn \\"Dies Irae\\" (made famous by composers such as Mozart) into the song somehow, which, admittedly, doesn't fit well at all and serves only to over-dramatize it.  Most of the rest of the album sounds pretty much a continuation of Bat II, albeit with a few darker and sometimes nu-metal-ish guitar licks.  In fact, a few of said licks come directly from the previous \\"Bat\\" albums (\\"Seize the Night\\"'s riffs come directly from Bat II's \\"Good Girls Go To Heaven\\"), and serve as a nice reminder of Meat's past glory.  The theme does continue nicely for the most part, but one just can't help but feel the musical déjà vu.  Again, if that was the point of this album, then bravo! <br />There are a few standouts that should translate well to the financial juggernaut of radio-friendliness; of course, the money shot being the now-familiar first single \\"It's All Coming Back To Me Now\\" (which was a duet originally written for \\"Bat II\\", but eventually all but butchered by Celine Dion).  Here on \\"Bat III\\", it's finally done some justice, and makes for a catchy duet featuring Norwegian songstress Marion Raven.  Many have already given it the classification of \\"this decade's `I'd Do Anything For Love'\\", and that's an accurate statement.  It's every bit as infectious.  In my opinion, Marion sounds great, but the female vocal nod should've gone to Patti Russo (who sang with Meat on Bat II's \\"I'd Do Anything...\\").  Russo fans shouldn't fret, however; she appears in another not-as-stellar duet on the album (\\"What About Love\\"), making an above-average showing.  Other standouts include the not-overly-but-just-dramatic-enough \\"Blind As a Bat\\" (immediately memorable), and the VERY 80's-sounding \\"In The Land of the Pig, the Butcher Is King\\" (the chorus of which I found myself singing along to by the end).  American Idol fans will be happy to hear 2004 finalist Jennifer Hudson's amazing chops on the duet \\"The Future Ain't What It Used To Be\\".  It makes for a nice surprise, and she complements Meat's vocals fluidly without overpowering him too much. <br />Overall, this is a pretty good effort for Meat Loaf, who despite not getting any younger still has the vocal range and power to pull off another rock opera-style epic.  It's not as solid and a little darker for the most part than Bat II, but still very good, and as rock opera-style epics go, it did satisfy my on/off-again craving for dramatic rock-n-roll laced with strings and choir. <br />If you're a fan of the Meat's previous two Bat albums, you'll definitely dig this one.  Just prepare for maximum cheese to go with your apple pie.
0783229526|2.0|I was \\"treated\\" to Johnny Depp and Benecio Del Toro in \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" on DVD. Based on the late journalist Hunter Thompson's book, this one had a few very funny moments, and the not-so-subtle message that real-life in Las Vegas can be as hallucinogenic as a drug trip, but spent too much time showing us how people on drugs walk funny and trash hotel rooms and rental cars (without paying their bills, of course). It was a step up from Bill Murray in \\"Where the Buffalo Roam\\", an earlier attempt to bring Thompson's antics to the screen, but still a pretty low step.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|I already have the It's a Wonderful Life DVD, that was released in September of 1995.  But I still found it worth purchasing this new release because it is so much more cleaned up digitally.  There are a lot of scratches and specs on the '95 release, even though it was re-mastered in THX.  This new October 2006 release has zero dust and scratches and that makes it a little more special.<br /><br />All grayscale accept the DVD menu and the Special Features documentaries.<br /><br />I love to see this movie around the holidays because the stress of the Christmas rush is downright depressing and this movie identifies with me and gives me encouragement during the holiday season.
B00003CWRX|5.0|\\"The Insider\\" starring Russell Crowe and Al Pacino is a rare intellectual thriller based on real-life events from the 1990's. You kept expecting the shooting and car chases to begin, but the story kept to pressure bearing down from all sides on the insider (a corporate whistleblower). Both Pacino as the TV journalist and Crowe as the whistleblower give good, understated performances. The production, directed by Miami Vice veteran Michael Mann, is stylized, but seems to fit the non-physical story well. Start this one on an off-day or early in the evening, as it's over 2 1/2 hours long.
078322737X|5.0|Budget 1 Million <br />US B.O.  115 Million <br /> <br />A fresh and innocent approach to telling a story of one night but really the story of life.  Great almost hauntingly real  comedy atmosphere produced on a shoestring budget with a bunch of struggling unknown actors who are about to breakthrough.  The extras of the screen test  and interviews from before the movie came out are fantastic.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I've seen MPATHG many times and it's always great. There are so many highlights--King Arthur arguing politico-economic theory with the English peasants, trying to justify his status as their king; the knights who say \\"Ni\\"; brave Sir Robin's minstrel singing odes to his lord's cowardice; the ongoing discussion as to how a swallow could carry a coconut from Africa to England (the various manservants clap coconut halves together to make hoof noises, while the knights trot along as though they're riding horses); and of course, the \\"harmless\\" killer bunny, the \\"meanest, foulest, most ill-tempered rodent\\" of all time. One of the funniest movies of all time has now been adapted to become a Broadway hit as the musical \\"Spamalot\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox wasted their chance to keep one of the best twists in Sci-Fi on the air. Mixing background elements of space, post confederate war old west with a dominating centralized government was truly inspired. Single season TV series featuring well crafted storylines, witty interaction, immense character depth and intensely entertaining chemistry. I could babble on for paragraphs and still not cover every aspect of this thoroughly entertaining series. The movie Serenity is truly the tip to this iceberg.
B0007OCG56|3.0|One week last year, my wife and I each picked a romantic comedy as rental fare. Her choice, \\"Spanglish\\", came first. It wasn't hugely attractive to me--I've never been much of an Adam Sandler fan (excluding Punch Drunk Love, which was a hoot), and Tea Leoni has to answer for her appearance in the awful \\"Sudden Impact\\". One potential positive was direction by James Brooks, who did Terms of Endearment (which in retrospect was quite similar to Steel Magnolias) about 20 years ago.<br /><br />I hung in for the entire 130 minutes of this tale of culture clash in Southern California. A Mexican women and her young daughter emigrate to the U.S. After six years working for peanuts in the barrio where everyone speaks Spanish, Flor (the woman) realizes that she needs to enter the Anglo world to find a better paying job, which she finds as a housekeeper for Sandler, Leoni and family. Sandler is a successful chef. Leoni is an achievement-oriented basket case. The Hispanic actress and her daughter are gorgeous. Cloris Leachman has a nice turn as Leoni's mother. The girl who plays the Claskys' daughter is terrific, but I just couldn't get past Sandler and Leoni to really enjoy this film, even though the story has some resonance and wasn't necessarily resolved in the \\"happily-ever after\\" fashion that you'd expect. The title refers both to the culture clash, and to the housekeeper's belated efforts to learn English, so as to better control the Claskys' influence on her daughter's life.<br /><br />I think most folks would enjoy this one better than I did (the rest of my family did). As a warning to parents, despite the PG (13) rating there's one clothed, but fairly explicit otherwise, sex scene between the two stars (ride 'em Tea!)
0345475674|5.0|This book is a novel but was very well researched. The author presented <br />the characters very well and the story line flowed beautifully. <br />It was a book that I found hard to put down.

B00005JMJG|5.0|\\"Eternal Sunshine\\" was my favorite film of 2004, and one of my all-time favorites.  Given that Jim Carrey starred, that's quite a tribute to both him and the rest of the people (screenwriter Charlie Kaufman and director Michel Gondry in particular) involved with this delightful and imaginative project.  Both Carrey and co-star Kate Winslet play skillfully against type--he shy and introverted; she way off-beat.  Their trip through mind and memory takes awhile to get used to--like eyes adjusting to a darkened room, but it's full of wonderful surprises once you get used to the view.  Other treats include Elijah Wood (Frodo) role as junior memory erasure technician and Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman's girlfriend) quoting \\"Pope Alexander's\\" poem that gives the film its title.  My strongest recommendation--as long as you can handle a little (well a lot) of time shifting.
0446528056|5.0|More pungently sweeter than \\"True Believer\\", more tension-filled than \\"At First Sight\\", Nicholas Sparks' new novel : \\"Dear John\\", touched my heart and soul. Also, it filled my head with bittersweet memories.<br /><br />Anyone who has been away for an extended period from those they cherish, can relate to this delicious read. It is a beautiful love story which pushes the human spirit to its limits -- while reminding one and all: love endures!<br /><br />Without revealing too much, the central character, (John Tyler) has a strained, complex, yet loving relationship with his father. Ultimately it shapes, effects and determines John's relationship with the woman he loves.<br /><br />To say he was like his father would be an oxymoron. Yet he possessed a sense of duty,  passion for love, and strong moral  character that could not have come from anyone else.<br /><br />It is a compelling, compassionate, and marvelous tale of lost and found love-- culminating in an ending that left me shouting for joy and longing for more.  If you can, get this book as quickly as possible, hold someone you love as closely as possible, and never let go!<br /><br />Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com
006092988X|5.0|Smith's classic story is about growing up poor, and about just growing up.  The \\"tree\\" of the title is young Francie Nolan, daughter of an alcoholic singing waiter and a janitress mother in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn in the 1910's.  Character, self-reliance, pride and love see Francie through a life where every penny is precious, and most breaks seem to be bad.  Even though the story is told primarily through the eyes of a teenage girl, readers of all ages will enjoy the book for the truths, along with a number of touching and funny stories, it holds.

B0006GAOBI|5.0|Donnie Darko- The Director's Cut is awesome. It adds so much more explanation to the movie than the original! It has 2 DVD's, it is definitely worth the buy!
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|i owned this music in both the original CD and cassette formats.  however, i was willing to spend $15.99 to check out what this \\"remastered reissue\\" is all about.  the result was astounding.  i listen to most of my music with a Bose system in my vehicle.  the difference between the original CD and the reissued CD is significant.  first off, the \\"width\\" of the music seems to be wider, deeper.  an analogy would be like, the original CD produced a listening effect as if you are listening the music in a small room, good music and rich music nonetheless.  however, the reissued remastered CD produces an effect as if you are sitting in a concert hall, much wider tha deeper in terms of the acoustic dimension.<br /><br />Secondly, a lot of the little notes (the percussion, the cymbals) that did not come thru' in the original CD all came out beautifully.  if you are a devotee of acoustic elements in jazz, you will be very much rewarded to be able to hear all these.  and you said to yourself, \\"gee, i did not know they played those little notes before.\\"<br /><br />by the way, i already purchased the Letter from Home CD which has the same high quality results per this review.
B00000099Y|1.0|There are 2 good songs on this disc, Stinkfist and Aenema. The rest are pure crap. Half of the tracks aren't even songs, they're just a bunch of noise. No wonder Tool won't put any of thier music on itunes or napster. They want you to buy the whole cd so they can have your $14 for like four real songs and ten tracks of filler crap. If you gave this CD 5 stars there is something wrong with you and you should be beaten severely.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|I do not often write reviews for Amazon, but every once and awhile I feel the need to, when I have something important enough to say. In this case, I feel I do. <br /> <br />My Chemical Romance saves lives. <br /> <br />I am not being hyperbolic in this statement. I have first hand proof. Yes, they have saved my life. And no, I am not an overdramatic 14-year-old. (Not anymore, anyway.) But that is not the point. If a band's music reaches a 14-year-old, a 21-year-old, and a 55-year-old (or in this case, all three), then that is a pretty large testament to their quality of work and versatile nature. That, dear friends, is the point.  <br /> <br />A lot could be said about the phenomenon of MCR's popularity, but I'd like to keep my commentary on that to a minimum, as this is first and foremost a review of The Black Parade. But this needs to be said: If you place judgement on this album based on a) the band's apparent \\"mainstream\\" status b) the fact that it doesn't sound like either of their previous efforts and/or c) you are sick of hearing everyone else talking about them and are content to write them off as another hyped up \\"emo\\" band, you aren't even worthy of listening to it in the first place. <br /> <br />First of all, I am sorry MCR is considered mainstream now, but that is a lame excuse that shouldn't even be used anymore, considering they have been on a major label since before the production of their last album, 2004's Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. I know everyone is eager to cry \\"SELLOUT\\" when a band signs to a major label, but they maintained all creative control when they signed and Three Cheers did pretty well, didn't it? If anything, it just ensured them larger exposure, a bigger chance to get their music heard by more people. Two, if you want to listen to a band that sounds exactly the same from album to album, a band of MCR'S talent and skill is clearly not for you. Luckily there are approximately eighty thousand other bands that will appeal to you,most notably Fall Out Boy and the Killers. And finally, absolutely nothing should be judged about a band based on hype, whether this is a positive or negative judgement. Put all your biases aside and listen to the music. Then form your opinion. <br /> <br />Now that that's out of the way, here is my opinion.  <br /> <br />The Black Parade is a masterpiece.  <br /> <br />I've been a fan of MCR since I heard You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison (from the speakers in an Urban Outfitters, of all places). The summer of 2005 was spent blasting Three Cheers from my car stereo, but I realized I was just as much enamored with their less polished debut, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Life. They became heroes of mine to an extent, with a success story to rival all success stories. (If you have no idea what I'm talking about, do some googling, find some old magazines on them or watch the DVD -- it's a pretty crazy story involving depression, alcoholism, rock and roll and comic books, just to name a few.) After the huge lovely circus that was Three Cheers died down, the band went back into the studio, and I waited. I did not have high expectations or low expectations. There were no expectations. What it would be was what it would be. <br /> <br />And here is what The Black Parade is: a ridiculously wonderful romp of epic-sounding tunes, brilliant guitarwork, dark yet uplifting imagery in the lyrics, as well as other intruments brought to the table, mainly piano. Gerard's vocals are as explosive as ever, thankfully with a little less screaming (the boy can sing and he should showcase that more, for sure), and guest vocals include not only Liza Minelli but several parents of the band members. The stakes are higher than they were on Three Cheers and it shows. While I love Three Cheers dearly, it did not keep me up at night. I heard The Black Parade and stopped sleeping. That only happens to me when it's the cream of the crop, trust me. <br /> <br />I'd love to go song by song but I'm afraid it'd all be rather repetitive, as everything is more or less equally amazing. Favorites are hard to pinpoint, but the Sharpest Lives, This is How I Disappear, Disenchanted and Mama are definitely up there. Oh, and House of Wolves, Blood, Teenagers, Famous Last Words... The only song I don't like is Cancer. It's widely known to be the band's favorite, but I'm sorry, boys, I'm just not feeling it. It's not technically a bad song, but somehow it just doesn't feel genuine enough. Also I can't help but think the refrain is unintentionally ripping off the Folgers jingle. (\\"The best part of waking up is Gerard Way in your cup!\\") Disenchanted packs the punch Cancer lacks, serving much more truth lyrically, and I can rarely listen to it without crying. But make no mistake, my dislike for one song does not detract from my love of the album as a whole. I do have to say I noticed more simplistic lyrics this time than on Three Cheers, but that doesn't bother me. If anything they're more straightforward than metaphorical. On the whole, however, I am not entirely certain how the Black Parade operates as the concept album the band says it does. But that could just be because of how personally invested I've become with this band and its members. I'll give it a few more listens on a more detached level and see what I make of it then. <br /> <br />All that being said, how exactly does MCR save lives, you ask? Well, they saved mine simply by existing. They have set up their music and their image around the concept of saving lives. To some it might seem silly, to others pretentious, but to the ones that get it, they know how true it is. Music, on its deepest, purest level, touches people. Music can pull you up from the deepest of holes, just because of one song that you know was written by someone who felt the way you feel. They know this. For a band obsessed with macabre imagery, the wonderful irony of MCR is how much they value life. They are not about the fame (which they have plenty of) or the money (which they also have plenty of). They merely want to get their message across in the best package possible, to change a life, save a life. That, essentially, is what makes them stand out from most of the other bands out there with nothing to say. <br /> <br />That is why I love My Chemical Romance, and why this album does not disappoint.
0156030209|5.0|This is one of the most unique and interesting books I have ever read.<br /><br />The perils of PI's adventure are of the most original concepts and are just<br /><br />a pure pleasure to read.

B000FZESY4|5.0|I bought this album because of the DVD.. and extra book pages and the packaging of this one hell of an album. GHOST REVERIES!! Indeed an astonishing album. My life have changed since the day I was exposed to Opeth in 2005. Then I realized I have been missing a whole lot.. I went to purchase all Opeth's back catalogues... Once you are a fan of Opeth you will be a fan for LIFE!!!!. I have a big Opeth's logo tattoo on my back.. and intend to get more.. I know Opeth will continuously put out quality music...Well as for this special edition.. I might say this is a great collection to add to your Opeth's library.. I don't even care much about soldier of fortune but appreciate it for Opeth's stepping out of their limelight and honored the legends. Opeth has always been a diversed group of people making music of diversed genre... Get a copy for yourself if you wanted to experience Opeth in 2006. Still A Brilliant Album!

B00005MP58|5.0|By far the best.   The movie with Keira Knightly does not come close to interpreting the book. The male lead who plays opposite Keira does a poor job with his part.   Colin Firth was excellent, however, as was the rest of the cast.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is one of the greatest racing movies ever produced. <br /> <br />The quality of the racing scenes is outstanding and the actors are great. <br /> <br />No computer animation here.  This is all the real thing like they did it on high budget movies in the 60s. <br /> <br />The film depicts what many consider to be the golden age of Grand Prix racing. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this one to anyone who likes racing.
B000A6T1HC|1.0|Cecilia Bartoli has her fans, no doubt, as the other reviews on this site demonstrate, people who love her warmth of tone and her impassioned interpretations. These vocal qualities may suit the performance conventions of the nineteenth-century repertoire; however in this anthology of eighteenth century sacred arias the result is an unhappy imbalance. The problem is, in my opinion, one of clashing calls for attention, whose affect is to distract the listener from attention to the music itself. True, the god of the counter-reformation was to be worshipped ecstatically. And true, also, that I am an anti-romantic listener, who grew up with those early music performances which valued detached purity of tone. This was vaunted as the ideal means of interpretation of the rediscovered seventeenth and eighteenth-century repertoire (it protested too much its rightness, and alienated people- but I like it). However to return to the subject at hand- I find Bartoli's readings of these crypto-erotic arias overblown and self-indulgent. I guess that this sort of coloratura always offered a chance for a bit of ego to be let loose, even in church- however when the performance goes so far as to insist on attention to itself rather than deflecting attention to the music, I stop enjoying the music. This recording does not find the balance between the big romantic personality and eighteenth-century performance conventions, which, after 30 or 40 years of self-critique, have some authority. I disliked it very much. I am a great admirer of Mark Minkowski's opera interpretations, which I think find a perfect balance between these opposing impulses of warm and cool- a binary we can trace throughout aesthetics and through the ages. Here there's an overbalance in favour of warm (hot, in fact), which the performers might argue is just the sort of vivification that Baroque performance needs. Not for me. I gave it to a friend (she's still a friend).
B00008DDRX|4.0|An excellent sports car racing movie. <br /> <br />Steve McQueen is great in it.  He actually has raced in these type of cars and he did most of his own driving in the movie. <br />
B000EMGJM2|5.0|Slick, funky, retro, sexy, smart and soulful all come to mind when listening to Van Hunt's sophomore effort, 'On The Jungle Floor'.

His vocal stylings go from sleek falsetto on the first track to a more deeper and dark style on the verses for the second track \\"Hot Stage Lights\\" but he goes back to his amazing falsetto for the chorus. Van Hunt and Nikka Costa share the mic on \\"Mean Sleep\\" and create a soulful, steamy duet. The chorus \\"I had a mean sleep over you, and it hurts coming back to life\\" makes this the perfect song to play for that special someone.<br /><br />There's a 70's funk sound present in many of the tracks of this album and the inspiration goes even further back a decade or 2 where the delightfully innocent yet modern \\"At The End Of A Slow Dance\\" makes you wish you could go back to a time where partners and slow dancing were the 'thing'.<br /><br />If you're looking for less mainstream, less radio, and more quality with tight production reminiscent of the sounds of Prince, Maxwell, and even the better stuff from OutKast, then definitely give this album a shot.

B000050IE6|5.0|There are certain terms and phrases of praise that can be applied to everything Opeth does. Wonderful musicianship, epic tracks of varying styles and textures, consistent class and quality all come to mind. But with \\"Still Life\\", Opeth's fourth album, you can add a few more. The music on this release is incredibly beautiful, enchanting and haunting. While I always listen to their albums in awe of their brilliance, this one touches me much deeper. The artwork, the lyrics, the melodies, the intertwining acoustic, the mixture of tender and brutal vocals, it all combines to form something that's purely...magical! <br /> <br />\\"Still Life\\" is a concept album, following the journey of a man who returns to his home, long after being banished, attempting to find his beloved Melinda. From what I can gather, she is in no position to be with him as he is still an outcast, and yet she still loves him. Unfortunately, they are discovered together and Melinda has her throat cut. In a rage, the man begins to slaughter the town members until he himself is finally executed and joins Melinda in the afterlife for good. <br /> <br />As you can tell, the mood of the album is that of despair. Album opener \\"The Moor\\" is a perfect example of the feelings of loneliness, anger and loss that is consistently portrayed throughout. The quiet intro sets the scene perfectly, seguing into beautiful acoustics which in turn mixes seamlessly with heavy guitars and Mikael's awesomely crushing vocals. Within a few minutes the music transforms without losing the mood and before you know it the band are playing death metal. While other bands fail to combine styles seamlessly, Opeth have become experts and this is the release that proves it. <br /> <br />Highlights include the above-mentioned \\"The Moor\\", \\"Godhead's Lament\\" (which has a simply awesome heavy riff, \\"Benighted\\" (an exquisite acoustic track) and \\"Face of Melinda\\" (the centrepiece of the album). But every track plays it part in the story both musically and lyrically to form a wonderful, moving piece of art. If you like death metal (but don't expect brutality throughout) or progressive metal (but can handle things a little more extreme at times) then check Opeth out. \\"Still Life\\" is a perfect place to start!

Was I surprised.  These are all old songs.  I was never real crazy about the songs when they were sung by the original artists.  Well Michael does something special to these songs.  I love them all.  The band that accompanies him is excellent and helps carry the songs.

B00005JPAD|1.0|This film had the makings of a great flick: a fabulous cast, great acting, and a terrific initial setup: You have DiCaprio as a mole for the police infiltrating the Mafia, and Damon as a mole for the Mafia infiltrating the police. But there's no character development, and the plot is weak, overly complicated, confused, and lacking in resolution.     Worst of all, this film is horribly violent. I walked out of the theatre feeling like I needed an exorcism and a valium. Hey, Scorsese, if you're going to assault your audience with all that gore, at least give us the payoff of character development and a well-crafted, interesting plot and conclusion.

Although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success, the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life.  This lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit.  Lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions.  A absolute must read book for understanding the real you.
1563890410|5.0|Highly disappointed with \\"Dream Country\\", I found myself a bit hesitant about opening the pages to this next chapter in possibly the most imaginative fictional character ever created.  \\"Preludes & Nocturnes\\" made me salivate for more of Gaiman's creation, while \\"The Doll's House\\" set the foundation for future stories and possible interludes, but when it came to \\"Dream Country\\" I found myself taking several huge steps back.  It followed a different beat, the characters were nowhere to be seen, and it felt like a colorful collection of short, un-compelling stories.  I was hurt, and it took me quite a bit of time to open Gaiman's next chapter, but not to worry, my fears ended as I started to read the first few frames ... Gaiman was back, and no door was going to be closed for this next collection entitled, \\"Season of Mists\\"!<br /><br /> Gaiman has this unique ability to bring worlds of near non-parallel existence together in a way that we could never imagine.  His darkness is back from the opening page when we meet one of his brothers - Destiny.  What is great about this opening is that fans of Gaiman's previous chapters will instantly have satisfaction in knowing that the cold spell known as \\"Dream Country\\" is over, and we are pulled back into Dream's world.  Gaiman re-introduces us to our heroine through his family, by introducing us to his sisters and brothers.  While we do not know the purpose of the meeting, we see how the family (perhaps not unlike your own family) interact and co-exist.  Like a glass of aged wine, the story progresses with comfort and ease, with Gaiman never quite giving us answers only leading us further down his darkened road.  We see humility with our Master of Sleep, Sandman, when he is reminded of a past love that he sentenced to Hell ten thousand years ago.  He wants her back, and due to the meeting (thanks to Destiny), he decides to get her back.  Nearly reminiscent of \\"Preludes & Nocturnes\\", we head back to Hell, but this time, Lucifer himself has a trick up his sleeve.<br /><br />Lucifer presents Sandman with the ultimate gift, the Keys of Hell, and it will be his decision on what to do with the \\"gift\\".  What creates the meaty center of this epic tale are what choices the Sandman is presented with by each one of the possible suitors looking to inherit the keys to the almighty Kingdom.  Gaiman intricately weaves different Gods from different myths and stories to give us such a vast universe of truths and legend.  Gaiman grows the small world we began with into something extraordinary, a world with more open doors than one could ever imagine.  We, the readers, are given hints towards the future, as to the strange occurrence of Dream's missing brother, the troubled love between him and Nada, as well as the angels that are determined to change Hell.  Loki is even traded for a favor that I am sure Gaiman will explore later.<br /><br />\\"Season of Mists\\" rebirths the excitement that was originally developed in the first two collections that introduced us to Dream.  These stories are dark, disturbing, challenging, and utterly fantastical.  There is an amazing blend (of which only Gaiman could create) of imagination, creativity, fantasy, and honesty within these stories that immediately pulled this skeptical reader back from the \\"Dream Country\\" void.  The images are crisp, vibrant, and completely within the realm of this series - for those that couldn't enjoy \\"Dream Country\\", \\"Season of Mists\\" will bring you back to the world that you loved.  Gaiman and his collection of illustrators bring us back to the world that we loved and missed with the last collection.  The disturbing truth of Hell, the infinite life of Dream's family, as well as the colliding worlds around that all pine for a track of land to call their own.  This collection opened a whole new world to the series, demonstrating that there is a world outside of our own that may have magic, but the undertones are very similar to ours.  Sibling rivalry coupled with competitive land developers are just a few of the channels that Gaiman bring to us in \\"Season of Mists\\".<br /><br />I haven't mentioned this in my other reviews yet, but I have to with this collection because it became more obvious to me as I read and saw Dream in each of the stories.  I am an enormous fan of what Gaiman has chosen to do with this character - he has given Dream a constantly changing face.  What I mean is that Gaiman always has new artists creating his work, thus providing us this true feeling of being in a dream where nothing remains the same.  I love to see other's thoughts on what Dream may look like, and while we revert back to the \\"original\\" form to demonstrate consistency, it is these subtle changes that make these stories more enjoyable each time you turn the page.  The Sandman may be only one person, but he wears many eccentric faces.<br /><br />Overall, for those that felt that Gaiman fell off his stride in \\"Dream Country\\", you will not be disappointed with this outing.  We go further into the mind of Gaiman to see his demons, his Gods, and his darkly religious undertones.  What I loved about this collection is that while there is this idea of religion, Gaiman seems to bring it to us in all different shapes and sizes.  There are Gods, but he skittles around the idea of one larger entity.  I loved the idea of \\"Chaos\\" and \\"Order\\", and the shapes that they chose to take.  I deeply enjoyed the poetic ending that seemed to bring purpose to it all - it seemed that Destiny did make an impact, even with just one small event.  \\"Season of Mists\\" easily ranks as my second favorite in this series.  While I do believe that there isn't one that could quite match the veracity of \\"Preludes and Nocturnes\\", this one comes very close.  For anyone that wants to explore the world of Dream, I would use this as a reference due to the humanity of his character in these stories.  He has a conflict, and it is how he chooses to deal with the issues that make him purely Gaiman.  I was impressed from page one!<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****ling rivalry coupled with competitive land developers are just a few of the channels that Gaiman bring to us in \\"Season of Mists\\".   <br /> <br />I haven't mentioned this in my other reviews yet, but I have to with this collection because it became more obvious to me as I read and saw Dream in each of the stories.

B00005JPAD|5.0|Easily the best movie I have seen in years and years. Maybe the best movie made since Boogie Nights (1997). Another Scorsese masterpiece so far above regular film making that it reduces the standard Hollywood release to be equivalent with TV commercials; that is to say mindless junk<br /><br />Perfect casting, acting, directing, screenplay - perfect everything. This is a movie you will want to re-watch for years. Maybe the best thing about this movie is that ending is not sappy and predictable. I could probably write 1500 words about this film but ultimately, it is a movie that creates a reality for the viewer and that is the goal of any film. A must see classic.

B000H0MKGK|5.0|I think John Mayer is one of the most promising upcoming artists.  He's not a hard-core blues - he incorporates blues lines with strong melodies.  At the same time, he stays true to the debut album sensualities, insights and self-exposing lyrics. <br />I would say this is still more of a \\"chick album\\" - not that there's anything wrong with that :-)   <br />I own it and am loving it.  All of my friends (30+ years old crowd) love it. <br /> <br />
B00004YYWI|5.0|Opeth took me completely by surprise back in 1995. I'd been hunting for black metal bands and pretty much anything violent and dark at the time. I therefore purchased a Candlelight compilation CD and two of the tracks on there were by a band called Opeth whom I'd never heard of. They didn't fit the description of what I'd been searching for and yet a couple of spins later and I would be thoroughly convinced that these Swedes were something very special indeed.  <br /> <br />The first word that comes to mind on listening to their music is class. Whereas so many bands around are trying to be as fast as they can, or as desolate as they can, or as evil as they can, Opeth just try to write damn good music. As far as I'm concerned they've never failed to do that in the 12 plus years of their existence. It helps that each member of the band is extremely talented, but talent doesn't always equal quality music, which is abundantly present in everything they touch, including this debut album.  <br /> <br />Not many metal bands would run with the idea of calling their debut album \\"Orchid\\" and displaying a pink flower on the cover. But that's a sign of the intellectual qualities of the band. They don't get caught up in all the seemingly necessary nasty image portrayals that so many other bands use to catch your attention. The cover is perfect in that it presents a depiction of the beauty held within its content and it's memorable in its uniqueness.  <br /> <br />There are five epic tracks here with a length of 10 or more minutes each and two short instrumentals to keep the listener occupied. Normally when albums contain tracks of such extended lengths, you can assume each one contains a certain degree of repetition. But that's not the case here. Each track contains a wealth of variety, generally not holding to constant themes and instead, branching out in many directions of differing moods and texture. Which is one of the things that differentiates the first two Opeth albums tothe rest of their work. While later releases do contain songs that are easily recognisable due to constant themes running through the underbelly of experimentation and musical adventure, both \\"Orchid\\" and \\"Morningrise\\" tend to move from one gripping section to another, never really inhabiting the one place for too long. One minute it's beautiful acoustic, next it's crushing death metal, then doom-filled harmonies and so on. I see this as both a positive (each section is both fresh and captivating) and a negative (it's difficult to hear part of a song and actually know which one it belongs to due to this lack of focus).  <br /> <br />This is not Opeth's best album, but it's excellent nonetheless. If you're into extreme metal (melodic and progressive death metal in particular), then this band are the holy grail. \\"Orchid\\" is the first of many masterpieces and an album I can go back to over and over again and still be filled with admiration and wonder.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I have to admit, I never saw \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" nor do I have any desire to for other than I know the story so why would I want to see a glorified violent version of it on the big screen? The only reason I own a copy of the film score to the film is simply because I love the music. When I saw the trailers for the film a couple of years ago, the music really stood out especially during the crucifixion scene. John Debney's film score reminds me of Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's work for the \\"Gladiator\\" film and a bit of Dead Can Dance with the Middle Eastern influences in the music. The orchestral film score is truly of epic proportions. John Debney certainly knows that music does play an important key role in movies. Despite not having seen the film, the titles of the tracks do match the songs themselves. I can almost envision the emotions of the characters in the particular scene that the song accompanies. Regardless of my personal feelings of the actual film, I absolutely love the music to \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".
B0009K8L5W|5.0|A very good production. First album known as the Official one (Magia and Peligro were a real disaster that anybody want to remember). Big hits as \\"Estoy aqui\\", \\"Donde estas corazon\\" that made history are in this album. So many feelings in the lyrics (Not as the last one \\"Ora Fixation vol 2\\", so commercial and superficial). Inside: full color pictures and the all song's lyrics. If you want to hear the real Shakira buy this album, great album from a great artist. <br />

B000E5N684|2.0|In case you've missed the plot summary, it goes like<br />this: Sharon Stone plays a cold-blooded, near-sociopathic<br />novelist whose boyfriend has just been murdered. The<br />crime, which involves some barely believable bondage<br />is a replica of one she described in her last novel.<br />Michael Douglas is the detective on the case and Jeanne<br />Tripplehorn is the police psychologist who is Douglas'<br />ex-girlfriend and is-in violation of any ethical<br />standard imagineable-giving him counselling after<br />a questionable shooting that left innocent bystanders<br />dead.<br />So the question is 'whodunnit?'.<br />And the answer is 'who cares?'.<br /><br />The plot is unbelievable-real cops would have solved<br />this murder in a day or two. The acting ranges from<br />giggle-worthy (Douglas) to creditable (Stone and<br />Tripplehorn). The complications are shrill and forced<br />and the attempts to complicate the whodunit are<br />so sad that they're almost not worth a parody.<br /><br />So why two stars? It's a beautiful movie and worth<br />seeing once (although you may want to fast-forward<br />through a lot of it) Stone's rendition of the<br />cheerful sociopath is good. Her nude scenes are delicious<br />and best of all, she is the second most beautiful<br />creature in the film.<br />Top awards for elegant nudity go to Tripplehorn who<br />is absolutely breath-taking even with her clothes on.<br />Those of you whose aesthetic is different from mine<br />may want to say the same of Douglas.<br />But even a naked Jeanne Tripplehorn is not<br />enough to make a good movie. Director Paul Verhoeven,<br />who did Spetters and RoboCop does a credible job<br />on this badly written, ill-conceived flick.<br />I understand that the film was under consideration<br />for a Raspberry Award and that only makes me<br />wonder how bad the film was that beat it.<br /><br />Lynn Hoffman, author of The New Short Course in Wine and the forthcoming novel, bang-BANG from Kunati Press.
B000H7JD4K|5.0|In my 35+ years of listening to and loving music, I have grown up with the best of the best. Sabbath, Zeppelin, Purple, and later Priest, Scorpions, Tull, Rush, Queen, U2, Tool, and Iron Maiden. I judge music by how it affects me emotionally. If i can feel the passion of the artists for their music, feel an adrenaline surge, feel a powerful connection to the music, then I'll keep coming back for more. Thus is the case with Maidens \\"A Matter Of Life And Death\\". The power and the passion are there in spades!!!         Thanks guys

B000GY729M|5.0|I gave it a few weeks before logging into amazon and posting an impuslive review of this cd. I have lived in Las Vegas for 8 years, and have always hated the kids here (Meaning hardcore, punk, emo, alternative rock kids, etc). That's why I was surprised when I heard the Killers first CD. While I liked Hot Fuss a lot, there were only a few songs that I kept in my Itunes library. There were a lot of throwaway songs I thought. On This CD, almost every song is good. I fell in love with the \\"When you were young\\" song and was not let down on the rest. It's a good cd that reminds me of every band I've ever loved put in a blender. I hear the Misfits sometimes (just a little), the Smiths, Depeche Mode. Sometimes it sounds like Placebo. It has almost a religious, weird choir music feel to it at times which I think is great. People say it sounds like Bruce Springsteen. I don't hear that, but whatever. If you're not a judgmental indie rock nerd who wants to put down a great band because you're unable to produce music this good, buy this cd. (Also, it's funny that the front cover has a picture of the singer of AFI in a bikini)

B000683VI4|5.0|I'm an avid reader, always have been, but I've felt kind of burned out of reading as of late, and who wouldn't be after reading hundreds and hundreds of books, one after another, usually reading two books at a time, several books a week?  Also, my schedule no longer allows me the freedom to read as much as I used to.  And that is why I decided to watch this film when Netflix sent it to me despite the fact that I hadn't read the Nicholas Sparks novel first.  Now I wish I'd read the book.  This is one of the most beautiful tear-jerking stories I have seen!  Everyone who knows me knows that I'm a sucker for stories that pull at the heart strings.  They also know that stories centered on star-crossed lovers are my major weakness.  Most of my all-time favorite books and movies have those characteristics in common.  I won't go into details about the plot because I don't want to give away spoilers to potential viewers (though I'm sure many people have done that already) -- all I can say is that you cannot go wrong with this film if you're a hopeless romantic.  The actors are wonderful.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams transmit all of the right emotions and do a flawless job with the characterization.  They add a great deal of depth and range to their characters and I can't imagine better actors for the roles.  Gena Rowlands is also wonderful as the older Allie.  And I like the 1940s setting and the backdrop -- however brief -- of the second world war.  The wardrobe, settings, scenery and cinematography are flawless.  The DVD is a great investment.  The widescreen edition makes viewing all the more pleasurable.  I cannot recommend The Notebook enough.  I don't know if I'll read the book because I don't like reading novels after I have watched their film adaptations, but I will definitely read other Nicholas Sparks novels in the not-so-distant future.

B000GIXLO8|1.0|My chief complaint stems from the \\"seamless branching\\" technique used on this DVD set. Instead of providing discreetly separate copies of theatrical and extended versions as with the 4-disker, apparently only the theatrical version is wholly present on this set and in the case of the extended edition, seamless branching accesses different areas of the disc, inserting extended footage into the theatrical version on the fly (back and forth, back and forth...). In theory this shuttling from one area to another is imperceptible to the viewer, although one does wonder about player wear and tear that this playback method must introduce.  <br /> <br />Perhaps hi-end DVD players genuinely do provide a seamless experience, unfortunately this is not true of my players (one computer DVD drive, one stand-alone). There are significant freeze-frame pauses every time the player jumps to access a remote section of film. No, this is far from \\"seamless,\\" rather, it is very distracting. <br /> <br />A much lesser complaint, although one still worth mentioning, is the physical condition of the two disks in the set that I bought: Side A of disk 1 was marred to a surprising degree with scuffs and scratches, looking much more like a used video rental than a new disk. Disk 2 was also marred but with an odd pitted mottling in one area. Even more surprising is how these defects don't appear to impact playback-- for example, the theatrical version plays without incident. I should also note that I did not purchase this set from Amazon, however I certainly wish I had purchased the 4-disker through Amazon as originally planned. <br /> <br />Odds are I'll either buy the 4-disker for its superior features, or compile my own extended version on the computer to eliminate seamless-branching lag. Well, at least the theatrical and extended versions of this film are in the same set, and the new-but-too-short documentary is good.
0465092756|5.0|Peter Woit is a noted lecturer in mathematics, and his Not Even Wrong: The Failure of String Theory and the Search for Unity in Physical Law thus offers up a physics discourse with a math foundation backing it. String theory, argues Woit, is not even good science: chapters provide a history of the theory and its development, Its high profile and many controversies within the scientific community, and wider-reaching conflicts in theoretical science fostered by the presence of the theory itself. Fascinating reading and a recommended acquisition for academic and community library Science & Mathematics collections.
B00006AW2M|1.0|Okay, I'm a BIG fan of the Stones, in fact they're my second-favorite band (behind the Beatles). But this is an absolute BOMB. Sure, there are two great tracks: She's a Rainbow and 2000 Light Years from Home. It's not a coincidence that these songs both happened to be released as singles, and that both are found on the More Hot Rocks and Singles Collection compilations. The rest? RRRRrrrrgh... dated beyond all possible belief. The worst of the bunch is Sing This All Together (See What Happens). An excessive jam vaguely reminiscient of In-a-gadda-da-vida (though not half as awful, I'll admit that), the only thing I can see happening is someone hitting the skip button on this stinker. Other bombs? Well, for one it was a BAD idea to let Bill Wyman sing on In Another Land, and an even worse idea to put all those freaky effects on his voice. This one gives me the shudders every time I hear it. The Lantern suffers from pretentious hippy-dippy lyrics; On with the Show is a miserable attempt at being funny. I guess Gomper is an OK track, with lots of weird instruments from Brian Jones, but that was about it. Thankfully, they got their heads screwed on tightly and released Beggars Banquet, one of their best albums, which began one of the greatest winning streaks in rock history. For good Stones, I recommend Aftermath; the Big Four (Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers and Exile on Main Street); the live Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out; Some Girls and A Bigger Bang, plus about half of Voodoo Lounge and bits of Tattoo You.
B00008VGL6|4.0|..and to tell you the truth, those things don't really usually catch my attention, unless I like the artist a lot. Yet, at the same time, I remember hearing \\"Stardust\\" and \\"Tiny Girl\\" at the time this was released and thoroughly enjoyed both songs. Some people may be disappointed that it's all covers, but if that weren't the case, they may as well have called it a Depeche Mode album. And in my humble opinion, Dave Gahan's are what completes the group. There are plenty of Gore-sung tracks I love though (especially the two from \\"Ultra\\"). <br /> <br />My favorites are the covers of \\"Loverman\\" (by Nick Cave) and \\"I Cast a Lonesome Shadow.\\" I haven't heard the first \\"Counterfeit\\" EP, but I like what I've heard from it. Also, this was recorded shortly after \\"Exciter,\\" so naturally, the songs here have that kind of feel. I think it's great; I even sort of love it. True, it may not have a lot of range, but range is overrated. It should only be used if the artist is going to get it right, which unfortunately isn't always the case.
B00006DEFA|5.0|I can NEVER get tired of watching this film.  I've been a fan of Mozart for as long as I can remember.  The actors were excellently chosen and gives a \\"historical\\" version of the lives of two rival composers (Mozart and Antonio Salieri -- if it actually happened this way).  I feel it is a good movie to introduce those to classical music.  Now I need to get the DVD before I wear the video out!
B00005LK94|5.0|Fly away home is a great family movie or a great movie for someone looking for an uplifting and edifying story.  The story is about a young girl who cares for baby duckings and teaches them to fly.  I wish there were more movies like this one.

B00000I8UD|5.0|Having discovered the music of Japan in the early 80's, I was not really prepared to hear the golden baritone of Sylvian's velvety voice.  Through the years, I have grown to appreciate every well-thought note that goes into his music.  Dead Bees on a Cake is some of the cleanest and sharpest recording he's ever done.  His voice envelops you and takes over your senses.  Lyrics are pensive, provoking and rich.  Musically, genious.<br /><br />The upright bass in Midnight Sun, just languishingly shuffling its way through the piece is the foundation for the mood set by Sylvian's tremolo voice.<br /><br />The edgy guitar has its place in the black midnight sun and rightly so.  The drums are never overdone, yet ambient enough to carry the whole instrumentation, especially the trumpet part in I Surrender.<br /><br />Thalheim, ambient and rich, gives Sylvian a blank canvas on which he uses just the right colour to paint exactly what he wants.  His voice is so smooth and commanding.  Lyrically, its rich ochre and earthy browns come out in a myriad tones.<br /><br />Sylvian's ability to integrate East Indian styles in Krishna Blue is evidence of his true talent and willingness to embrace other cultures and religions.  He is an inventor, a master artist, a believer of his creation.<br /><br />Caf&eacute; Europa is another well-paced masterpiece.  At 7:00 minutes, the listener is taken on a journey of introspection, melancolic joy, a budddhist nothingness and therein lies the beauty.  There's nothing to question... just take it in.<br /><br />Wanderlust is a languishingly joyful piece, mirroring his discovery of new love and bliss.  Again, the drums are omnipresent yet never overbearing... the ride carries you, the snare asserts and beckons you, the electric Rhodes is exquisite and tastefully sparse.<br /><br />Praise is homage to one of Sylvian's mentors... using this old woman's improvised meditative song, he superimposes light layers of soundscape to highlight the honesty of true praise to Vishnu.  Respectful and noble.<br /><br />Finally, Darkest Dreaming is another of this painter's eloquent brushstrokes of genious.  Harkening back to Gone to Earth, Sylvian's pleading voice is enough to open up your heart and rinse it clean of years of cobwebs.  No matter how dark, he is finally letting the happiness in.<br /><br />Dead Bees on a Cake is a true representation of talent, integrity and artful creation for the connoisseur of good music.honesty of true praise to Vishnu.

B000GG4KTU|4.0|Much has already been said here about this album, but I'm going to add my $0.02. I own all of Diana's albums except Stepping Out, and, in my opinion, From This Moment On is neither as bad as the one-star naysayers would have you believe, nor is it her best CD ever as others have raved. This CD reminds me most of Only Trust Your Heart, which is far from my favorite Diana Krall album. Actually, I thought she was headed in the right direction with The Girl In the Other Room. I thought that recording was her most creative, personal, and original recording to date, and I really liked some of the original tunes like the title track and \\"I've Changed My Address.\\" This album is definitely enjoyable, but I think Diana does edgy, bluesy, even sad material better than peppy, happy material. In short, my main complaint about this recording is her choice of material. She picked standards, which I normally love, but these are just not my favorite standards. I'd much rather hear Diana do something in a minor key like \\"How Deep Is the Ocean\\" on Love Scenes than these tunes. Thankfully, she performs some of her best ballad renditions ever here with \\"Little Girl Blue\\" and \\"Willow Weep for Me.\\" Those tracks saved this album for me and led me to decide to buy it despite my relatively mild misgivings. I also agree with other reviewers that Diana shines more in an intimate small-combo setting than when she's backed by a big band, though the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra does a fine job on this album.

0385512058|5.0|I do a lot of networking around town.  It is often that I will meet people and share coffee with someone and then I will not continue to keep in touch with them.

He has creative ideas about working your circles, having productive social gatherings, networking properly and always seek out to meet someone new.
1416500278|5.0|The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the greatest books of our time. It is over one hundred years old, but has aged gracefully and is still easily understood and as relevant to matters of life now as it was when it was first published. Though there have been many imitations of it and many film depictions of it, none of them do justice to the real thing. This timeless classic follows the development of a teenager, Dorian Gray, into manhood as the people that he calls his friends corrupt his soul. This is symbolized in a portrait that Gray hides, which was painted by the man who was perhaps his only good-hearted friend, Basil, who later met his untimely demise. Along with the exceptional plot and surprising twist at the end comes the message that Oscar Wilde cunningly imparts to the reader: One must be master of oneself because outside influences often disfigure one down to the deepest part of their soul. On top of all this, the book is also simply well written and entertaining. It is enjoyable because Wilde uses his mastery of everything from satire to suspense to convey his message and an extraordinarily compelling plot to the reader. You should read this book if you are looking for new knowledge, literature with a deep message, or simply a good time. This edition is especially helpful because it has a glossary for the meanings of some older words and supplementary reading written by Oscar Wilde.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is the T.V. series that the movie Serenity was based off of, and is one of the best things I have seen. It was kicked off half way through the season, but it is important to keep in mind that FOX did not air it in the right order, so it was hard to understand. Originally, this was just a thing that I was going to watch, but my whole family has become hooked. This series all have great plots that keep you hooked beginning to end, I would call it one of the best sci-fi shows of all time.

B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is amazing! My first Nightwish CD, and perhaps the best that I've bought all year. It may also be my last Nightwish CD, since they kicked Tarja out of the band... She was the power behind the band, she was what made it all work, and without Tarja I Just don't think the band will ever be as good. But this cd is amazing. Most of the songs are done in a fashion similar to that of a soundtrack score, and Tarja's powerful, mystifying voice makes it all come alive in such a way that your imagination will run wild. BUY THIS CD!
B000002VCQ|5.0|Sadly, Whitney Houston has spent the last few years digging herself into a deep hole that she'll probably never get out of (no pun intended; she was still alive when this review was submitted), but she still has to be given credit for making one of the best albums ever; an album that argues strongly against the existence of the \\"skip\\" button. \\"Saving All My Love For You\\", \\"You Give Good Love\\", and \\"How Will I Know\\" were all huge hits and rightly so, but every song is absolutely beautiful, especially the funky gems \\"Someone For Me\\" and \\"Thinking About You\\" as well as the criminally underrated duet with Jermaine Jackson \\"Take Good Care Of My Heart.\\" The next two albums that she made weren't quite as good, but she hadn't completely flushed everything down the toilet just  yet. However, pretty much anything she made after 1990 is definitely bottom-drawer compared to her 80s material.
0131479415|5.0|The agile project planning methodology is very practical and accessible. Following the approach outlined in this book will allow you to understand exactly how the project is progressing and make the necessary adjustments to ensure the project is successful. I highly recommend it.
B0000025RI|5.0|What more can be said about this album? Every song is worth hearing so many times that it's just nearly impossible to get tired of it. SEVEN of its 9 songs charted at number 10 or better, and even \\"Baby Be Mine\\" was getting a fair amount of airplay well over a year after the album was released. Personally, though, my favorite song from the album is \\"PYT\\" even though songs like \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Beat It\\" were more successful. Even if he comes to be regarded as the strangest person ever to walk the earth, this album should still be treated like royalty.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|I first got into Meat Loaf in the summer of 1988 when my uncle played the first Bat Out Of Hell album for me.  I was hooked from then on. <br />I went on to buy Dead Ringer (Meat's second album) a year later and I followed him as I could from there.  I bought his subsequent albums that I could find (which were damn hard to find in the late 80's when Meat wasn't \\"cool\\"). <br />I grinned from ear to ear when I saw all the hype and press that surrounded the Bat II album.  I knew I as everyone else was in for a ride.  What an album that was!  Meat sang great on that album.  Steinman's songwriting was top notch too.  There were songs borrowed from Jim's Bad For Good album as well as new ones.  There was not a weak tune to be found on it (IMO).  That album seeped emotion from it's pores. <br />The 3rd installment is no exception.  Steinamn didn't write the entire album, but what he contributed did set the tone for the rest.  I was quite skeptical when I read that Steinman wasn't directly involved with this album.  He did write 7 tunes, but he didn't oversee the recording or production at all.  You would never know it from hearing this album. <br />There are some differences between Steinman and Desmond Child's writing, but Child gave it his best shot.  In my estimation, Child hit a home run.  I don't know all the details behind Steinman's absence during the recording, so I won't go there.  I just know the final product is very much akin to the trademark \\"Wagnerian\\" rock that Jim Steinman brought to the table for the first two \\"Bat Out Of Hell\\" albums.   <br />The big thing I noticed missing was Steinman's sense of humor.  Many of the tunes here are of a more serious nature while a lot of the tunes from the previous Bat albums had a sort of humor to them.  I've always pictured Steinman as sort of a mad scientist type with a strange sense of humor and romanticism that came across ONLY in his music.  For that, I will always admire him. <br />Anyway...Desmond Child did a finejob capturing the spirit of the first two Bat albums.  The arrangements are over the top musically and overblown for the casual listener.  But for the converted, they sound right at home.  That's exactly how the other two Bat albums were. <br />I can't help but wonder what this album would have sounded like had Steinman wrote the entire thing and produced it, but I'll never know.  But...I won't let that keep me from enjoying it either. <br />If you enjoyed the first two Bat Out Of Hell albums, then give his one a spin.  I would imagine most will not be disappointed.

0451209338|5.0|It isn't embarrassing for me to admit that this wasn't my first Gabriel Allon read by Silva. Probably like a lot of others, I started somewhere in the middle. So, when I read \\"The Confessor\\", I had to fill in a few blanks for myself. I left some of my questions unanswered until I got to find out where it all began, and here it is... THE KILL ARTIST! I wondered if Silva would have really made it interesting for those who thought they knew about Gabriel Allon and Ari Shamron. I had some stuff to learn, and what I never knew was some life restored for me!<br /><br />So you learn some background about Gabriel Allon. You realize he is a world class art restorer. He has his regrets, and he has his reasons, some pretty good. Oh, but he gets the challenge, and Ari Shamron pays him a visit. Hey, Allon's working on a masterful Vecellio, so why the heck would he want to go back into the game for? Maybe for a man named Tariq? Oh yes, that just might prick the ears and enlighten him just a bit. But he's also put with a beautiful agent, and that makes the stakes just a bit higher. Put a man named Yusef in the picture, and boy do you have a deadly kiss of chaos, but the lips just might be worth the kiss! And while you're at it you'll eavesdrop on meetings in Paris, and you just may taste the cold steel of a Beretta. You may even care to crave a Tunisian date with Yasir Arafat, but you'll wonder if you dare take a bite. It all comes together in the end.<br /><br />This is where we meet the great Prince of Fire! There's a lot of hostility built up in this, emotions pumped for the greatest of revenge. Yet at the same time you find such a human element that you can't put it down, because you know you'll miss something great. I still have some catching up to do with \\"The English Assassin\\", and I can't wait! I'm here to tell you that Silva paints quite carefully, bringing with him to the canvas an advanced palette. The brush strokes are ever so careful and delicate, yet the finished work might be a sight for sore eyes. That combined with good wine, and great fury. Daniel Silva isn't a man to be missed with his work. If you do, you're missing the best!ed work might be a sight for sore eyes. That combined with good wine, and great fury. Daniel Silva isn't a man to be missed with his work. If you do, you're missing the best!

0790744295|5.0|'CREEPSHOW' is a fun horror/comedy flick. <br />An unofficial tribute to all those great Amicus films of the 70s', <br />and especially the pulp comics of the 50s'. <br />I very much enjoyed 'Something to Tide You Over' and 'The Crate'. <br />Though the image tended to be a bit soft(over processing?) at times, and a bit dark in spots. the colours were mostly very vivid in keeping with the content. <br />Hopefully Warners will release a special edition in the forseeable future. <br />All in all, a good film with a few jolts...and quiet a few laughs.
B000JSI7AI|1.0|Come January 23, Brokeback Mountain gets the much awaited 2-disc collector's edition dvd release. Sadly the new edition has very little to offer. Being a 2-disc collector's set, so much was expected from this edition...But all its got is a new DTS track and just 2 new featurettes, including \\"A groundbreaking success\\" (which I'm sure, as the title suggests, is nothing more than the people involved, appreciating each other), Music from the mountains (obviously only about the music) and an art gallery of still images!! Other than these, all the features from the previous release will be available on the disc which barely run for 45 minutes.    Being such a groundbreaking and talked about film, at least a Director's Commentary was expected for a special edition like this...Sadly its missing. Also, no real meaty extras here to give any in-depth look at the making of the film or the impact the film had. Maybe they've saved all these for a triple-dip in the future.     Sadly, being a big fan of the film, it was a long wait which ultimately ended in a huge disappointment. Few collectible cards and meaningless, weightless extras, is not what I was looking for in this edition...it was much, much more than that!    Its time, Universal realised that the fans are really pissed off with this upcoming extremely poor edition and delayed the release, to add some real special features on the discs.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|* BLU-RAY UPDATE 2 of 2 - The [[ASIN:B01JCV6KZQ October 2016 two-disc 70th Anniversary Platinum edition of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; Blu-ray]] is an outright duplicate of the [[ASIN:B001UHOWXI November 2009 two-disc Blu-ray edition of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;]] - with the EXACT same extras and features.  The 2016 edition comes with new packaging that describes itself as a &#34;Platinum Edition&#34; - which in my view, is a marketing gimmick to lure buyers into thinking this re-issue is different from what we got in 2009.  In fact, with the 2016 &#34;Platinum&#34; issue - nothing has been added, modified, enhanced or subtracted from 2009.  As such, the 2009 Blu-ray issue is still the gold standard for this title - no matter how often the packaging changes - until something significantly new or different is released to customers.<br /><br />* BLU-RAY UPDATE 1 of 2 - The [[ASIN:B001UHOWXI November 2009 two-disc Blu-ray edition of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34;]] contains both the black-and-white and colorized versions of this film in high definition - and is configured similarly to the standard definition [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO &#34;Two-Disc Collector's DVD Set&#34;]] that was issued in November 2007.  There are four notable differences:  1) The very few audio defects from the [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO 60th Anniversary Edition black-and-white DVD edition]] that was issued in October 2006 have been wiped clean, thus making this 2009 two-disc Blu-ray the new &#34;gold standard&#34; for this title.  2) The old, 14-minute &#34;A Personal Remembrance&#34; featurette memorializing the passing of director Frank Capra in 1991 - with interviews from Capra himself and from actor James Stewart and hosted by Frank Capra, Jr. - has been dropped from the 2009 Blu-ray.  3) The subtitles on both Blu-ray discs have been replaced with a sharper white typeface that looks better on high-definition TVs.  4) A second set of subtitles for the deaf and hard-of-hearing (SDH) has also been added to both Blu-ray discs.<br /><br />* All other special extras, i.e., the 1990 standard definition &#34;The Making of 'It's A Wonderful Life'&#34; featurette hosted by Tom Bosley - and a re-release theatrical trailer now rendered in high definition (but not cleaned) - have been carried over to the [[ASIN:B001UHOWXI 2009 two-disc Blu-ray]].<br /><br />* As the cost of Blu-ray players and discs continues to fall through the floor, more buyers are taking the plunge and replacing selected titles in their DVD libraries with high-definition Blu-ray discs.  Although the Blu-ray edition DOES boast the sharpest images to date - in my view, it's not necessary to make the upgrade.  There IS a difference in image quality between the DVD and the Blu-ray - but it's not dramatic enough (especially if you're already using an upscaling DVD player) - to junk your 2006 or 2007 DVDs of this title.  Also note that this film is presented on Blu-ray in its original 1:37:1 semi-square aspect ratio format.  Like &#34;Gone With the Wind,&#34; &#34;Casablanca,&#34; and the equally wonderful [[ASIN:B009L147EE &#34;The Best Years of Our Lives&#34;]] - the latter which beat &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; as the Best Picture of 1946 - this film was NEVER shot with wide screen cameras.<br /><br />=============================================<br />ORIGINAL 2006 and 2008 PRODUCT REVIEWS BELOW.<br />=============================================<br /><br />* Rather than review the content of this almost universally beloved film, I'm just going to comment about the quality of the 2006 60th Anniversary Edition DVD itself.  I've since written an updated review about a new edition of this title, now available in a [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO &#34;Two-Disc Collector's Set.&#34;]]  Please find that review -- which was posted on December 13, 2008.  (Amazon has posted my 2006 review in both places -- even though the [[ASIN:B000HEWEJO &#34;60th Anniversary Edition&#34; DVD]] is DIFFERENT from the [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO &#34;Two-Disc Collector's Set&#34;]].  Read my write-up for the [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO &#34;Two-Disc Collector's Set&#34;]] -- to better decide which product you prefer.)<br /><br />* I've owned nearly every version of this title in almost every format available on home video during the past 25 years. It's true that the CONTENT of this Viacom/Paramount DVD -- including its special features -- is identical to the Republic Pictures Home Video release more than 10 years ago.<br /><br />* However, this 60th Anniversary edition is spectacular for several different and extremely important reasons.  (I'll address the criticisms some people have leveled about the sound on this 2006 DVD in a little bit, so stick with me.)<br /><br />* You don't have to be a technical expert to immediately notice the striking improvement of the picture AND sound in this 2006 edition. The print is crystal-clear and in my view, has more vividness and sharpness than ALL other previous releases of this title on home video.<br /><br />* Proof?  I put my &#34;old&#34; THX-version DVD issued by Republic Pictures / Artisan Home Video (the former DVD gold standard for this title) -- into my Sony multi-changer DVD player -- and watched and listened to every frame of this film AND its special features. I stopped and started this &#34;older&#34; DVD in several spots -- and stopped and started the new 2006 Paramount edition repeatedly -- so I could compare quality almost &#34;side-by-side.&#34;<br /><br />* Hands down -- this 2006 version is fabulous. The spots and dirt have been wiped clean, the sharpness and contrast are arguably better than what film audiences saw 60 years ago. There are no ragged spots, no jumped frames and no lint, fiber or hair fragments along the edges or jumping across the screen. I believe the technicians at Paramount (which acquired Republic Pictures Home Video) -- digitally cleaned EVERY frame of the last DVD release -- so that the film now looks like a million dollars. It's almost too pristine, if there is such a thing. No jump cuts, no &#34;jump ahead&#34; sound breaks, no fogged-out scenes, nothing ragged -- with the result being the cleanest and purest version of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; ever issued in home video history.<br /><br />* It gets better. English subtitles were available on older DVD versions of this title, but the 2006 version has a cleaner typeface, wiping out some of the confusing and unnecessary attributions of &#34;who's saying what&#34; that were disruptive to some hearing-impaired viewers. In this 2006 version, you'll get a mostly straight, line-by-line reading of what's being said -- as it's being said.<br /><br />* Meanwhile, the DVD's special features - which includes the same pair of documentaries produced in 1990 and 1991 - are identical in that they were shot on video tape hence there isn't much improvement in picture quality. However, subtitles that WERE NOT available for these special features - are NOW available in this 2006 edition. The only &#34;extra&#34; that remains unchanged - is the original 1946 trailer. Subtitles are not available and it has the same raggedness and dirt commonly seen with vintage trailers stored separately from the films they used to advertise.<br /><br />* I'm highly critical of re-issued DVDs that seem nothing more than an excuse to squeeze more dollars out of buyers for the same material with new packaging. But this 2006 Paramount DVD version of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; is the best to date.  It is NOT in color.  (I own a colorized version for younger people who can't stand black-and-white.  Despite controversy surrounding colorization, know that [[ASIN:B000VDDDVO the 2007 &#34;Two-Disc Collector's Set&#34;]] has the same 2006 60th Anniversary black-and-white edition you see here - plus a new &#34;colorized&#34; version.  This version uses the same pristine print - but has the added bonus of boasting the best &#34;color&#34; hues ever seen for this film, using the latest image technology available.  Despite my preference for black-and-white, the quality of this new colorized version is impressive.)<br /><br />* Meanwhile, let's address the criticisms about the sound on this new DVD. Go back a little bit. Much was made when Republic Pictures Home Video got the THX LucasFilm sound system seal of approval for &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; during the 1990s. But it was still two-channel mono with negligible equalization of sound effects. In this 2006 DVD, you'll get consistent two-channel mono and decent sound equalization to minimize &#34;booming&#34; and over-modulated portions in the film. In the old versions, you had to turn down the volume a notch during the musical portions -- and turn it back up when the dialogue came back. It's a nit-pick, but you really notice the difference if you're crazy enough to do a side-by-side comparison like I did.<br /><br />* As for the digital sound &#34;pops&#34; that perfectionists keep bringing up -- they're right. They're even in the spots noted by another fine reviewer who listed time codes where you can find them. But in my view, unless you brace yourselves for them to arrive like a booming train - unless you purposely crank up your speakers to carry sound throughout your house - yeah, you &#34;might&#34; be annoyed if you demand the same perfection for a film made in 1946 as you would for a film made in 2006. Honestly, the disproportionate attention given to these digital &#34;pops&#34; is, in my view, giving fence-sitters the impression that they're supersonic cracks of lightning that will make people jump out of their seats. I didn't twitch at all. They almost &#34;blended&#34; into the 60-year-old soundtrack. Yes, I know they're digital defects, but do you remember the zillion &#34;pops&#34; scattered throughout dirty prints of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; with filthy optical soundtracks? The audio on this 2006 DVD still wins.  You have EVERY RIGHT to demand perfection for your dollars. But as a person who's more fastidious than average - I don't believe most buyers will care about a few &#34;pops&#34; in a film that's this old. Combine the overall improvements with the relatively low cost of this DVD - and I still say this is the BEST experience of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; I've ever SEEN and HEARD on home video.<br /><br />* Finally, another reason to buy this DVD. It's old news to some, but it's not widely known that this version of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; can only be broadcast by NBC.  It used to air a zillion times during the holidays on every TV station on earth. It was a quick way to get tired of even a super film you think you know by heart. But Viacom/Paramount now owns this version of &#34;It's A Wonderful Life&#34; and NBC has exclusive licensing rights to air it just once or twice after Thanksgiving.  This is a good thing for future generations to appreciate.<br /><br />* So junk the old, buy this version and be happy. It may feel painful, but it's worth it. And no, I DON'T work for Amazon NOR for Paramount Home Video.that remains unchanged - is the original 1946 trailer. Subtitles are not available and it has the same raggedness and dirt commonly seen with vintage trailers stored separately from the films they used to advertise.<br /><br />* I'm highly critical of re-issued DVDs that seem nothing more than an excuse to squeeze more dollars out of buyers for the same material with new packaging.

B00005JKG9|5.0|Salesmen have it tough. If you ever were one, you'll know the routine. It is the most hectic and uncertain effort for gain yet invented. Sales sucks! But it is like nothing else when all falls into place and a big deal is closed. The niggling little sales are the killers; so much effort for so little gain. Six characters spill their guts to make a buck. They lie to stay alive, and make it an art - especially when they tell the truth, the strongest of lies. They steal, they corrupt the fabric of human society - trust. They love it as a drug, and this movie (play) shows all the facets of the perfect \\"deal\\" and the perfect failure. Not a love story - unless you love human nature. Lemmon is human in this movie; he makes a real effort not to overact - and pulls it off. All others are merely supurb.
0307341542|5.0|This book is not flowery and soft.  There are parts I thought I could not read, did not want to read.  But this book has a great plot and before you know it, you are hooked to the end.   <br /> <br />Cannot wait until Ms. Flynn's next book!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to admit that I never thought much of the space-western idea and never watched a single episode of Firefly when it was on the air.  I was looking for something new and stumbled on this DVD set.  I bought it based on the customer reviews that I read on Amazon.  Even after I bought it, the set sat on a shelf, unopened, for a couple of months.  Then one lazy weekend morning, I decided to watch the first episode.  Then I watched another.  Four discs later and well after midnight I finally finished the set.  I hadn't planned on watching them all in one sitting but I couldn't stop myself.  I just wish there were more episodes to watch.  I got some satisfaction by watching the Serenity movie but sill wish there were more.

B00008DDRX|4.0|Somewhere in this movie, there is supposed to be a romantic subplot. Well, McQueen wanted to make a movie that showed all the grit of LeMans for the entire race, and in my estimate, he won out over the studios. The action is in-your-face, and shows just what goes into this sort of racing. Thankfully, the love story subplot is mostly lost, making for a pleasant viewing experience for the racing enthusiast.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I was a little disappointed to start off with. <br />The sound was not up to scratch. A little disappointing. <br /> <br />However, after setting the Audio option to \\"Surround Sound\\", my Pioneer 5.1 surround system came to life. <br /> <br />This is top class entertainment that I will enjoy over & over again. <br />The planet needs wholesome & uplifting music like this !
B000HBKCDC|5.0|I am a fan of Sarah McLachlan AND good Christmas music - therefore, I LOVE this album.  I think she's done a beautiful job on all of the songs and her lovely voice really kind of gives the traditional songs on the album a new and refreshingly magical sound.  I am so thrilled that she's finally done a Christmas album, and I really think it's a good one to add to your holiday music collection!  If you love her voice and her style, then I really think you'll enjoy this album.  HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

0060595183|5.0|Aldous Huxley is definetly the right guy when it comes to making a point. If you are interested on TDOP & H&H you have first to consider what is it that you are looking for. The point is that as you read the book, all your veils and prejudice just happen to fall and you find your self flying in another dimension, wondering the adventures he has been through, the points of view, psychological, physical and mentally you seem to change and evolve.<br /><br />It was my first door....
B000BW7QWW|4.0|This movie is a fine yet bittersweet chapter in the saga that was the TV series, \\"Firefly.\\"  Of particular interest to fans of the show, it nonetheless stands well on its own as a fast-paced sci-fi drama with a droll touch of humor. The heroes are a compelling mix of misfits--some stoic; some ironic; some brilliant and talented; some less so--and all share a bond forged from living together in a dangerous and unsettled world aboard a rather decrepit spaceship, Serenity.  These are characters you can care about and root for (played deftly by interesting, appealing actors), and the special effects and action in the film keep it visually interesting. All in all, an intelligent, fun, and well-crafted movie.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|Everyone should see this movie...It does not matter if your Gay or Straight.

0743298020|5.0|Setterfield's debut novel provides the reader a fairly modern story (though the time of the setting is never revealed directly) with a Victorian era gothic feel.  Every gothic conceit a reader could imagine from a combination of JANE EYRE, WUTHERING HEIGHTS and several other 19th century classics set the precedent upon which Setterfield builds a fantastic story.  What would a gothic story be without a mad woman in the attic, a recluse, mental illness, a once beautiful mansion now in ruin, found manuscripts and letters, orphaned children, fire, and mysterious hauntings.  This framed story of character Vida Winter--famed writer and recluse--is set within the outer story of Margaret Lea--also a book  <br />lover--surprised when chosen to be Miss Winter's biographer.  Margaret begins to put pieces of the Winter's puzzle together and the inner and outer stories take some interesting twists toward the climax of both.  Readers who enjoy the gothic tradition will not be disappointed.  Likewise, readers who enjoy a \\"quietly suspenseful\\" mystery about books and the love of stories--and stories about stories--will also enjoy this novel.

B0002IQHY8|4.0|I think this is a solid effort by Alan Parsons, but a few of the tracks are a bit too techno for my tastes.  I listen to Alan Parsons music becuase of the quality and professionalism of the artists playing on the disc, from that stand point this disc hits the mark.  But the techno stuff is not for me.
0060234814|5.0|The Chronicles of Narnia by accaimled author C.S. Lewis is worth every penny. I bought a copy for myself, but I am saving it for when my son learns to read. The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe will move you if are you 25 or 5 and the story is a of such a kind--that you are the better for reading it!
0743289412|4.0|This book becomes totally engrossed in Lisey and is more \\"psychological\\" than many of his early books. Rather slow getting started too but ultimately well done and satifying to the reader. His books reflect where he is in his life and since he almost lost it this seems to be the result.His prejudice and stereotyping of his characters from the south is getting more annoying, however
B00006J9OT|5.0|What a great recording, stylish with a lot of class.  This is one of the cleanest live recordings I've heard in a while, every instrument can be heard clearly and the arrangements are superb. Diana Krall's talent goes without saying or in this case, I will say, EXTRAORDINARY and Totaly Delightful. <br />Any old Jazz lounge hounds and ladies get your hands on this album, it not only waxes nostalgic with style, it will make you want to fall in love all over again.
6304806418|4.0|I love musicals. But all musicals have to deal with that potentailly awkward moment when the song or dance number is over and we have to return to reality. Parker solves the problem neatly here by staying in \\"operatic\\" reality throughout. Madonna is absolutely wonderful, but Antonio Banderas is often even better. The central section of the film -- from Eva Duarte's arrival in Buenas Aires to her famous balcony scene (\\"Don't Cry for Me, Argentina\\") is about as good as a musical may ever get. Too bad it couldn't end there...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|With over 2,000 reviews, I'll get lost in the shuffle, but suffice it to say this series was taken far too soon. So soon that Joss was so freakin' upset he went on a rampage and was unstoppable until Serenity was made. As a Buffy/Angel fan I should have known this would be just as good.  <br /> <br />I just saw this a month ago, so I'm late to the show and sorry I didn't become a Browncoat years ago when the series was on the air. Nevertheless, I came to LOVE this show and feel such regret that we only got one season--and not even 22 episodes.  Such a treasure and so ripped out from under us. If you think it looks grungy, confusing and bleak (which I did originally) just try the first episode and you'll fall in love with the oh so wonderful and engaging characters. Don't let the sci-fi/western surface fool you into turning away, you have to give this a chance and  you'll be a fan before you can get the second disc in your DVD player.
0440418569|3.0|I was amazed by the first two books and couldn't wait to finish the last one. I don't have a problem with the religion opinion of the book. It was still very well done although it was somehow slowed down a little. However the answers for the questions are too simple.  <br /> <br />I was deeply touched by Lyra and Will's love and weeped by the sad ending. Then after a night's sleep I realised that it didn't have to be like this at all. As another customer's review said, if the billions of worlds can survive OK with thousands of windows open for hundreds of years surely the billions of world can afford to have a window open for them just for say 60, 70 or 80 years? Not to mention the worlds started to be saved just when they fell in love with each other, shouldn't this special love be blessed? The angles could handel the Spectres they can certainly look after the ones created during their short lives. Furthermore, isn't the knife can kill anything? Now that Will could see the Spectres he could easily kill the new born one every time he cut through to another world. <br /> <br />Another problem is that the children had incredible courage when they were doing things for friends etc. It should not be a shame that they use all their courage and will power to fight for their very own fate! Since the witches and angles had identified the problems then everyone on their side should try to solve them. We know it's easy to get sick when go to Africa therefore we have all sorts of vaccinations to reduce the risk, but we still go.  <br /> <br />If there's nowhere else, human beings would not have sailed so far to discover new lands and we'd have stopped space exploring already. If there's nowhere else Lyra and Will wouldn't have met in the first place. In the book they have met, therefore there is somewhere else. Why can't different worlds try to communicate, trade or even fight just like between different countries? Shutting up is certainly not the right attitute. If the subtleknife could be invented 300 years ago then it can be invented again and there can be more than one exsists. Why should Lyra and Will pay by their first love? <br /> <br />As for they can't live in another world for long, why? Don't know. But why no one tried to figure it out? Now that we can prolong the lives of most cancer patients because we never stopped trying! There are dozens of reasons not to give up their dreams. The whole theme of the book started to be inspiring but depressing in the end. They had be the first ones to get out the land of dead alive they surely can be the first couple across diferrent worlds - if they were still Lyra and Will and if at that moment they truely loved each other. The true Lyra and Will hadn't followed anyone's instructions, why they suddenly decided to follow so easily in the end? Hm... <br /> <br />The writing is beautiful, the idea is fresh and interesting, the sadness in the end is touching but absolutely not necessary.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is fantastic, I couldn't stop watching... 5 episodes in a row was the record! The story lines are engaging and individual. The characters are human...flaws and all, and of course there is drama at every turn. I highly recommend this series to all.
B000E33VWW|5.0|Philip Seymour Hoffman is absolutely fantastic in this role, the story, though quite disturbing, is interesting, and the movie made me want to buy the book by Truman Capote.
0670034711|5.0|I really loved this book.  It's a great story of a woman's efforts to regain herself after a bad divorse.  The book has lots of hilarious moments as well as ones that are achingly sad.  Her honesty and sense of humor throughout make it a book that's hard to put down.
B000EGF0B4|5.0|This movie really grabs you. The actors are excellent, and the story very decent, despite what people may think before they see it. A must see !
B000E6ENP8|5.0|Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon beautifully captured the love story of Johnny Cash and June Carter. The fact that they did their own singing, etc. only enhanced the movie 100%. <br />I put this movie on my list of My Top 100 Favorite Movies Of All Time! <br />Great message of redemption and how love really does conquer all! <br />Any awards or accolades that Joaquin and Reese received for this movie were well-deserved.

B000093BDX|5.0|I bought this album and then ordered it as a present for a old friend. All you have to ask yourself is: are you any kind of Beach Boys Fan? This cd has 30 tracks on it--count them--which is more than twice as many as you usually get,and they're all good. Most are great; so you can play this one over and over and over. That's my view. I'm not a regular  reviewer just a Beach Boy fan.
B000654Z2I|5.0|the ultimate \\"crusin' down the highway\\" driving soundtrack. My one complaint is that at the transition into \\"Mushroom Head\\" (a pivotal rhythm change, styled perfectly by Liebezeit)-- they put a *(&*%&*^& break between the songs-- ostensibly so our CD players can figure out where the song starts.  Its just awful...like drawing a mustache on the Mona Lisa so we can tell where her mouth is.  Let's all go back to demanding LP's-- if you have a good turntable and $200 to spend on one album (actually, perhaps there are some for cheaper somewhere)-- drop the digital and go analogue.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|...and you are lucky enough to have music, \\"No Other\\", should be with you.  I guess this is Gene Clarks' masterpiece, but it's hard to know for sure since he wrote so many great songs in his too short life.  What makes \\"No Other\\" different is that in addition to the songs, the production by Thomas Jeffereon Kaye is quite elaborate.  This song cycle does not have a single bad track and the bonus songs are incredible too.  The last track on the CD, \\"Lady of the North\\", is in my top 10 favorites, right up there with \\"A Salty Dog\\" by Procol Harum and \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes\\" by Sandy Denny.  Folk, rock and psychedelic never merged so perfectly, Gene Clark was a genius, and in my opinion should be compared to Bob Dylan and Neil Young.  One difference is that Gene Clark was a better singer!
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|I loved this movie and its call for independent thought which seems to be lacking in this US of A.  It's about time someone brought up what could be in our future if we are not careful..

B00003CXDD|5.0|Applicable to ages 8 thru 80, this movie is a classic piece of story telling.  With its tight script and excellent acting, it would make an excellent addition to any home video collection.  Chalk another one up for Ron Howard.
0143057375|3.0|I like Eckhart Tolle a lot. His teachings are very simple and inspiring. But this CD brings nothing new. It just repeats his old teachings.
B00004XQP4|3.0|First, Green Day is my favorite band. Honestly I do not understand why Warning! did not do as well as the previous. From a musical and guitar player standpoint, it was much better and more mature. Even Green Day themselves said they thought this was their strongest (before they came out with American Idiot). Many non hit songs that they did in the past were somewhat bratty and annoying (particularly on Nimrod). You almost wanted to shoot Billie to get him to shut up.  <br /> <br />However, Billie Joe IS an awesome singer and makes wonderful, catchy melodies, but I have noticed Billie has never been the best guitar player...at least in the past. <br /> <br />The folk sound gives it a nice quality, much more original compared to the other works except American Idiot (which was the best Green Day work of all). One can tell the guitar rifts and song structure is more complex and not as simple as past works (such as song Minority or Dead Beat Holiday/ Hold On) which a big plus if you play guitar. <br /> <br />Another nice thing about this work is that it references some classical stuff. The song warning definitely has a classic \\"Rock around the clock\\" like sound from the 50s, while Macy's Day Parade has the same chord progression as many classic 50s love songs. You can almost hear Whoopi Goldberg from the movie Sister Act sing \\"I love him, I love him, and then I'm going to follow, I'll follow.\\" <br /> <br />This album did not have a bunch of filler songs like Nimrod, nor does it have a stale \\"forced\\" sound like Insomniac (when they were trying too hard to please fans that they were still \\"punk\\"). <br /> <br />However, I believe Green Day did not receive the success they wanted because it WAS mature and different, or, at least more allied with pop/ classic rock. As previous reviews said, it is \\"more Nowhere Man\\" (which is a beatles song from Rubber Soul).  <br /> <br />Green Day has slowly lost all old fans who drooled over Dookie and now has a whole new group of fans. Ihave noticed over the years those who liked Warning a lot where major American Idiot fans, including myself.  <br /> <br />If we ignore the fan base as the reason for its lack of success, there are some weaknesses. While this is my second favorite Green Day album, I had a sense that it \\"just wasn't finished.\\" Green Day, up until now has a tendency to make really short songs, which one gets the sense they \\"just could have been longer.\\" American Idiot is an extreme contrast with previous works. <br /> <br />The strengths of this album also played in with the weaknesses. For instance, Macy Day's Parade's classic chord progression would be a good example. That type of chord progression is so overused for \\"good songs\\" even today its ridiculous. There is very little variation in how the song is sung and the chord progression. It could have been much longer and differed in progression like Jesus of Suburbia did, considering this was supposed to be an unhappy song.  <br /> <br />DeadBeat holiday and Hold On could have also been worked on harder. These two songs if one listened carefully and read the lyrics, could have expressed much more emotion for what its about. If you read about green day in general, Hold On was intended to be written for one of Billie's friends that lost a loved one. While supposed to be a happy song, it fails to convey the emotion and the sense of the death of a loved one compared to American Idiot's \\"Wake me up when September Ends.\\" <br /> <br />By far the best songs on this album were the obvious Minority and Waiting (Macy's Day is also excellent, just except the complaint above). Waiting could have been a little longer, but it still is a very beautiful song. Minority had a good blend of lyrics and catchy rifts. This is a song that set the stage for the political ranting seen in American Idiot. <br /> <br />Face it. Green Day realized that punk is \\"good for one time only.\\" Only when did they start forgetting about what people think (and wasn't thispart of the message of punk anyway?)and did their own thing, did they start sounding not just good, but REALLY good. <br /> <br />
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I just got this cd today and have played it three times already.  <br />I absolutely love this cd, as in it is now one of my favorites in my collection of hundreds.  <br />Alot of it has a bluesy soul sound that is fantastic. The guitar rifts added to Johns unique voice make this cd a great buy! <br />John Mayer did superb work in this cd, and I highly recommend it to everyone!
B000002MP2|3.0|I have Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot. <br /> <br />Dookie was the first green day album I ever listened to. However, I even admit to myself how much better the guitar playing and song structure was on Warning and American Idiot compared to Dookie. <br /> <br />While it is still good, there is a distinct lack of originality in guitar playing and song structure, as well as different elements such as brass instruments which were heard in Nimrod's King for a Day. <br /> <br />Dookie's strength was from Longview, Welcome to Paradise, Basket Case, and When I come Around. These songs are good, but not nearly as musically creative like the later works. Probably the best two songs were Welcome to Paradise due to the emotional background (but is still very weak and unfelt compared to American Idiot) and Basket Case's catchy, hilarious song about somebody with Panic disorder. <br /> <br />I am a huge Green Day fan, and I completely agree as a guitarist/musician myself that the later works rightfully deserve the praise they got (compared to old Dookie fans say) as being better. <br /> <br />Still, songs like Basket Case and Welcome to Paradise are true classics and Dookie is what got Green Day famous.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|Most of these Christmas songs have been performed by many different artists over the years.  Sarah makes these songs her own though.  She plays the guitar and piano with so much skill.  Every note and every key sounds flawless. My favorite tracks are Wintersong and River. These are beautiful songs about missing a loved one at Christmas time.  Sarah plays the piano so effortlessly.  I like the tone of sadness in her voice on these songs.  O Little Child of Bethlehem and What Child Is This are two  other highlights on this disc.  Sarah's voice sounds so spiritual on this track.  Her guitar playing is a perfect compliment to her vocals. I'll Be Home For Christmas is a sweet romantic tune.  I think Sarah sings this song well. Happy Christmas is another favorite of mine. This song is about a call for peace around the world.  The choir sounds beautiful on this song.  Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas is a track that simply puts me in a relaxed and pleasant mood.  Song For A Winter's Night is a track about how spending time with loved ones can be so special.  I love this CD of Christmas songs.
B000002N2P|1.0|I have not heard Kerplunk, but probably out of Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, Warning, and American Idiot, this is the only one I would truly label as bad (Nimrod was better, but not great either). The sound is very forced. Green Day admitted that they tried to make it darker sounding to lash out at fans who criticized them as sellouts. It also was trying a little too hard to preserve the \\"I'm still punk\\" notion which fortunately Green Day gave up years later. <br /> <br />I have known for a long time that Billie Joe was never the best guitar player, (except the guitar playing is pretty good now)and Brain Stew's refrain that is supposed to sound like a ticking clock is very bad. It sounded even worse in the live album, Bullet in the Bible. <br /> <br />Geek Stink Breath is really the only other song on this album I liked. However, its too short and the guitar playing way too simple.  <br /> <br />In general, unless you are a major Green Day fan, there really isn't much you're missing in this album. <br />
B00000I07P|4.0|I am enjoying this BonJovi cd immensely!  Brought back some great old memeories for me, too.
B000F39M9W|5.0|The most exciting, stimulating and satisfying experience one can have in a concert hall these days is to hear Esa-Pekka Salonen conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic performing Stravinsky. I have had this pleasure at least half-a-dozen times (in addition to a greater number of performances of Stravinsky conducted by others). Three of those Salonen concerts were performances of Le Sacre du Printemps, including the live performance on this disc. While a CD cannot equal a live performance, this disc is a splendid recording of a shattering musical experience. Listening to the disc, in my mind's eye I see and hear it as I did last January from my seat five rows above the second violins, visualization, for example, the bassoonist as his playing is momentarily at the fore. Of all the recordings of Le Sacre I have heard and own, this is the only that lets you truly experience the deep and complex architecture of Stravinsky's music as only the best orchestras can produce. <br /> <br />Under Salonen, the L.A. Phil has become the pre-eminent orchestra in the U.S., if not the world. It is also THE orchestra of the 21st Century. Every band member is a virtuoso. But what really sets apart this orchestra is the edge-of-the-seat playing of every member. Maestro Salonen somehow compels every musician to push his or her limits. Stated another way, no member of this orchestra is satisfied with just being great. Every performance is fresh, vital. It is 20th, and now 21st, century music in which this quality is most evident, and with no piece more so than Le Sacre. This disc captures the ferocious energy, blazing emotionality and masterful precision of the Los Angeles Philharmonic in this most audacious and revolutionary work. It is the recording that all future performances will be measured against. <br /> <br />Be warned, however, that this disc is not for everyone. If you prefer the lush (some would say saccharin), \\"back of the seat\\" sound of, say, The Cleveland Orchestra or the Vienna Philharmonic (especially under the direction of a certain former L.A. Phil music director), then you likely will not enjoy this performance. While these are fine orchestras with world-class musicians, their approach is nearly oppositive that of the L.A. Phil's. Salonen's focus on precision, virtuosic intensity and vitality may jar compared to the more conservative, old-fashioned sound you are used to.

0800141660|5.0|I wouldn't argue how faithful this production is to Austen's masterpiece, but would procliam that it's indisputably one of the most beautiful, balanced and perfect period films set in the Regency Era - and arguably the best filmic example of Austen's works.    The lively interplay of Thompson's emphatic Elinor and the youthful Marianne played by Winslet lies central to the success of the film. A succeeding formula crowns the work under the immaculate direction of Ang Lee, the maestro of picture-perfect mis-en-scene with a lush, sublime and stirring score by Patrick Doyle.    Like one of the reviewers, I was inducted into this film at a \\"wrong\\" age and found it to be a bore. Years later, a foray into \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" by Keira Knightley kindered my interest in Jane Austen works adapted for film and eased me into the joys of this marvellous film. While \\"Pride\\" by Knightley was a delight to watch, \\"Sense\\" is in every sense, a classic to behold.
0670034711|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend that just spent a week in Italy with me and a small group of couples.  I loved the description of a football match the main character attended in order to learn to swear in Italian. The book is full of wonderful places to smile and lots of places to understand the healing of all these magical places.  I would love to follow the footsteps of this story. I am an old hippie and I guess that is a large part of why I loved this book so much!
B000HCO840|2.0|As a big fan of Xmen and dvd collector it was disapointing to buy this dvd with soooooo little extras. When you spend money on the more expensive versions of films you want at least SOME value for money. This only incorporates trailers, deleted scenes, commentary and marvel movie trailers (eg FF, Daredevil, Electra etc). No featurettes on how they made the film or interviews with the actors. Yes, you get a small comic with it but its not all that good IMHO.   2 stars for the product not the movie.   Movie 4 stars.     To review dvd quality though, the picture and sound of X3 is excellent. I sat back and enjoyed it just as much as when I was in the cinema. Your surround system will sing with this movie.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|This is typically the kind of movie that we would like to watch more often . Everything is well thought and it doesn't try tobe spectacular to get deeper into the subject . Roots of terrorism , conditions of despair, cyniscism and greed are the elements assembled like a puzzle to explain the complexity of our world where a few wealthy control the destiny of the majority. But in the end ...someone has to pay the price
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If you are a Sci-Fi fan then this is a must for your collection. Best series I have ever seen. I could not stop watching it.
0743289412|5.0|As a voracious King fan, I knew I would own and read this one. What I did not expect was the heart-rending love story here--beyond the mystery (which really wasn't much of one: who hadn't figured out what was going to happen to Jim Dooley pretty much as soon as he appeared at Lisey's house??) was a story of love that transcends time, and connectedness that is hard to explain to anyone who has never experienced the kind of great love that Scott and Lisey have. Lisey's grief is tangible; her path to mourning her loss is tangled up in her sorrow and her denial and her unwillingness to move on, not to mention the \\"sister thing.\\" I was engrossed, entertained, and I mourned for the end of the story, when I had to leave Lisey and her world.
1594200823|5.0|I bought this book after reading and enjoying Pollan's earlier book \\"The Botany of Desire\\". I found \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" to be thought-provoking and interesting to read. Pollan traces the origins of 4 different meals as a way of working through the omnivore's dilemma of knowing what foods are good to eat.  <br /> <br />Pollan makes the facts and figures come to life by going to see the places where food is made, and isn't afraid to laugh at himself and his own reactions. But he challenges us to think hard about what we're putting into our bodies, and how we want to eat in the future. Just because we're omnivores who can eat nearly anything and survive, doesn't mean that everything available in a supermarket is good for the long-term health of our bodies and our planet.

B00000JPH6|1.0|This movie seems very popular with a lot of fans, but I have something different to say. I've seen it, once, when I was about 5 1/2. Maybe adults get a kick out of it, my 10 year old brother (at the time) enjoyed it. So, if you're an older viewer than maybe this movie is good, but please, keep it away from young children. This movie terrified me as a small child and I ran out halfway through nearly in tears. Please, doen't be overly anxious to share this with your kids, it may be best to wait a few years. It is one of the most terrifying memories I have as a little girl and I certainly wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone else.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|This movie is almost like Evil Dead meets Ever After and Van Helsing, while Sleep Hollow provides the backdrop.  This movie is like a mainstream B movie.  There were times I found myself laughing out loud at how cheesy or genuinely funny the movie was.  I would say Matt Damon and Heath Ledger didn't do a bad job acting, however both of their performances aren't anything to get excited about either.<br /><br />It is worth watching this movie just to see some of the set design and SOME of the special effects. But there are other movies in this department that deliver in a much better fashion.  I don't think this movie did very well in the box office and I think I have a theory.  This movie was promoted with a PG-13 rating, which means anyone who is over 13 or with someone as old as 13 can see this movie.  Well some of the graphic violence in this movie was crazy.  I can see a parent not wanting their under 13 year old to see this violence, and an adult might wanting more graphic violence.  I don't know, I felt this movie was pretty brutal for a \\"light-hearted fantasy adventure\\".  Come on man, let's be honest with the viewers of America, this movie was morbid.  I can list some moments:<br /><br />1) A man is shot in the back of the neck and there is plenty of blood<br />2) A child looses his eyeballs via mud<br />3) Spider webs come out of a horses' mouth and eat a child<br />4) A woman's face cracks and the decay of death is reveled under her skin<br />5) A man is lanced with a broken flag pole<br />6) Several decapitated heads<br />7) A kitten is killed by a huge fan<br />8) Horses are lit on fire<br /><br />Now the violence didn't bother me, a movie is a movie.  I just find it so interesting that there is such tightness around movie ratings.  For instance, the F bomb automatically makes a movie rated R.  However the former elements are put into a movie combined with a spooky-fantasy aspect and it is a family film.  Oh well I suppose this is why I never made it in the movie business.
0060987464|5.0|The Long Hard Road out Of Hell is an amazing read, full of sex, bondage, drugs, satan, and rock & roll. a rare insite on how the heartless the music industry is and how it can suck you in, chew you up, and spit you out if you let it. Manson delivers with the same gothic/demonic class his music has. This book is a rollercoaster ride starting from his youth right to the realese of \\"Antichrist Superstar\\". I recomend for any Manson fan, or anyone who doubts what he is about. A must read in anyones life.
B000053VAZ|5.0|It's a BIG 5 for me. It's one of Johhny Depp's most adorable movies ever. It's full of happy feelings and fun.
B00005JOFQ|5.0|A riveting film with great performances. I especially underrated performance is Michele. She has a range of emotions that makes her a great actress.
B00000637V|5.0|this may be Reed's finest album. his vocals are wonderful--delicate, strange and musical. he's still got just enough control and range to actually sing rather than drone. the songs themselves are stunning. \\"the kids\\" is probably the best thing he ever did, featuring a malicious, enigmatic narrator (the \\"waterboy\\") gloating over an ex-lover losing her daughters to a child welfare agency--twisted and heartbreaking. this deranged, brooding ambivalence permeates the entire album, and is quite hypnotic.   The production, although elaborate, works beautifully for the most part (except for some unfortunate slick guitar solos that marr \\"sad song\\"). unlike some of Reed's other '70's albums (such as transformer) the arrangements complement his songs with loving care. there's an unlikely cast of \\"classic rock\\" musicians--jack bruce on bass, the brecker brothers on horns, steve winwood on keyboards--but their playing is surprisingly sensitive to Reed's offbeat style.
B00004RD54|5.0|OK, let's get this out of the way first: with Hunter and Wagner on guitar, even Tom Waits would sound like Bowie. In this case, it was during a time when Lou was realizing that pop music stations would STILL only play his mildest material. Guess what? Why not do a live album of just such material and just this once ACTUALLY PUT OUT THE MONEY FOR A GOOD BAND! What a concept! And it works like a charm. This is without question not only one of the best heavy metal albums ever, it illustrates the exact point I just noted about musicians. This thing kicks butt on every level. It's the right material played by the right people at the right time. And the \\"overture\\" to Sweet Jane is some of the best guitar music of that decade. One spoiler: This music came from one of two nights this band played: people I know who were there suspect that some/most/all (?) of this material not only wasn't from that gig, but isn't live either. Because if it is, where's the rest of it? All the same, a great, great CD.
1592402038|4.0|Call me an antiquarian who still believes that punctuation is the greatest development, but you have to agree that a well written report, properly punctuated, is a pleasure to read.<br /><br />Lynne Truss brings a toungue-in-cheek tone to a dry subject and makes it both readable and informative. I enjoyed the light-hearted yet instructive tone of this book so much that I've given more than a dozen copies to students and employees.

0440241588|4.0|A storyteller who can grab your attention and keep it is \\"doing his job\\", I guess.  Grishham is one of my favorite pop-lit writers and who only disappoints occasionally, never completely.  This is one of those times and the only time, I think, that I've caught a whiff of his boredom.  In The Broker, he seems to rush, or telescope the plot, leaving out detail in the continuity so that the denouement arrives all the quicker.  I dunno, maybe it's just me.<br /><br />Anyway, it's a satisfying read for all Grisham fans.  I'm looking forward to reading his new non-fiction book.  (Maybe it's the reason he rushed to complete this one!)
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I very seldom buy a soundtrack but I made an exception for \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  I thought the composer not only captured the time period in which the movie took place but also the gamut of emotions throughout the film.  One of the standout pieces is \\"Liz on Top of the World\\".   After I bought the DVD, I decided I had to have the CD, too, so I could import some of the soundtrack to my iPod.  Highly recommended if you're a hopeless romantic like I am!!!
B0009X766Y|5.0|How can you go wrong with Robert Redford and Paul Newman.. the magic they spun with Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid was matched and exceeded with this witty, twisty tale of two grifters out to make one huge score.  The story, acting and twists will keep anyone interested.  The movie seems so much shorter than it's running time.  The chemistry between the two superstars is the best!  It's from 1972, but it is a timeless tale, and it's magic will captivate all.  It's on my all time favorites list!
B000H0MKOC|3.0|I watched this film the other night after hearing about the hype. it has it's moments. it tackles on the Ciagarette business. it uses the media for it's on purposes Pro&Otherwise. the Humor is cool early on&then there is a Part of he film that sorta starts to drag along. the casting was cool,but there were points of the film where you are starting to hope they get a bit quicker to the end. I dug the Narration element to the film though. it was a interesting Satire nevertheless.
076781214X|4.0|This movie is a classic, especially for Nicholas Cage as Peggy Sue's boyfriend/husband.  Kathleen Turner is also excellent as Peggy Sue.  The movie gives Peggy Sue an opportunity to go back in time to her high school days and see how she would change things from her past if given the chance.  I'm sure each of us at one time or another has thought about how life could have been different.  There is also some great humor in this movie.
1594200823|5.0|Although my trips to fast-food joints have only been reduced (not eliminated), I've found myself referring to fast-food beverages as \\"Drinking Corn\\"....you'll need to read the book to find out why.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you're at all curious about the food you eat.  It was great that the auther was able to give both sides of the story for each of the 4 meals and I've certainly been taking a closer look at where my food comes from!
B00008DDHZ|5.0|The best movie I have seen in a long time Have watched it a few times and never get tried of it  It brought home what the people of Ireland had to go through and the heartache

B000H30B2C|3.0|I'm not a fake critic here acting like the movie is below me, so I'll just make it quick and simple.<br /><br />The Good: The CG Kong and T-Rex looked great. Various old scares and many other details, made them look believeable and they also maintained there size throughout the whole movie. Kong doesn't magically get bigger at any time. The scene in the park was pretty sweet and gave ya a warm feeling. The fact that a beautiful women falls for a average looking guy was nice to see for a change.<br /><br />The Bad: Over the top super fake scenes which sadly is in most of the movie. Some poorly rendered CG animals and bugs. Three T-Rex chasing one blonde girl ever after chasing a larger meal, yeah okay. The stampeding scene with the dinos, okie dokie.The fact that people where so easily manipulated by Jack Black. The fact that Jack's character as annoying and adnoxious as he was and the jerk never dies.<br /><br />Conclusion: It was an okay movie. Not as great as people made it seem like it was. I think they should have toned it down. Ihe over the top scenes were just plain rediculous.

B000003T9B|4.0|I don't know how well the inspirational crescendos translate to today's modern, younger metal set.  It certainly doesn't approach the thrash of today's standards; but this is not only valid as a history lesson, it's a good album and the best of Overkill's first four or five efforts (I don't know what they did after that).  It's got great mood swings and it actually does thrash at times.  And the whole damn thing is just so catchy. <br /> <br />Usually the \\"catchy\\" phrase is a bad thing.  When I think of \\"catchy\\" and early 80s metal, I think of bands like RATT, who managed catchy hooks that seemed to make them sound heavier than they really were... and somewhere along the line, if you truly cared for the music, or at least the thrash, you realized that bands like RATT sucked.  Not the case here.  This album has most of the requisite early 80s metal references - violence, satan, and literally \\"Blood and Iron\\"- but they're delivered in a great package of galloping rhythms and hard-driven catchiness that still make me want to jump up and play air guitar.  Or hit my real guitars until I remember that I'll never really be able to do solos like Bobby Gustafson.  It still makes me want to scowl, though.  In public. <br /> <br />And it all happened before that self-conscious period inspired by the early successes of \\"The Headbangers Ball.\\"  In following albums, Overkill managed to still write some good songs and get a little heavier -tho not really harder.  Yet nothing that I know that they've done, not even that decent second album, compares in my mind to this one.  The way I'm portraying it here, \\"Feel the Fire\\" is very similar stylistically and obviously chronologically, but in a relative sense, to \\"Kill `em All,\\" although: 1) this is actually a more polished work than Kill `em All; and 2) Overkill would never approach the things that Metallica was going to do.   <br /> <br />So, Yep, it's a different musical vehicle than Pantera, Napalm Death, Slipknot, or even Overkill's comtemporaries, like Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax.  But it's good, clean, early metal fun and in my mind, an early peak in a vast, metal/thrash genre.   <br /> <br />If you've got your head set on straight and don't take yourself too seriously, but like decent music and a good time -and/or if you've got any kind of curiosity of the history behind music you might be listening to today- I highly recommend you get this unfortunately oft-overlooked disc that might just be an early masterpiece of metal.  Those of you getting the CD will benefit from a cover of \\"Sonic Reducer\\" that wasn't on the original album, but you'll be missing the backward message that comes at/after the end of the last track.   <br /> <br />If this is a vague article, I apologize, but I didn't come in to this expecting to review an album.  I checked my email, had this review request from amazon and thought that if no one's written anything about this great old album, it's a sin and someone's got to.  If you're curious enough to be checking it out and also reading all of this, just get it.  You'll probably thank me.
B00007AJF9|5.0|An outstanding, beautifully produced movie with an exceptional cast.  Anyone who enjoys historically-based dramas will certainly find this movie quite captivating.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I am now officially in love with this musical. The music is fantastic, if just a little less passionate than the live performances. My soundtrack came in great condition, too, if that's important.
B000GTLQXU|5.0|I was a big fan of the original, so I was skeptical. But this one is just as good in it's own way. The special effects are AWESOME, and the characters are just as well thought out and thrown together as the original.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What can I say?  This movie is the final installment of the captivating series Firefly by Joss Whedon.  If you know the series, then you're going to buy this movie.  If not, then welcome to the end of a great story.  The movie picks up at the end of the Firefly series.  I strongly recommend that you pick up the Firefly season along with this DVD.  The show and the movie have characters that are easy to love and hate.  My favorite part about both the movie and the series is how the characters all make fun of and mess with each other.  I could see my friends in the characters of the show and that always makes for more entertainment.

1558908382|5.0|Sharp wit combined with excellent delivery make Grosse Pointe one of my favorite movies.  It's always interesting when the protagonist is such an aweful person, yet seems like a hero.

B000FTWB7G|4.0|For a while I wondered if this album would ever come out. 3 and a half years is a long time to follow up a debut album. With Ben Moody gone I didn't hold out much hope, but I was very curious just incase it was good. I am happy to say that it is. It's more personal than the first album, and it has some great experimentation. In particular I love Snow White Queen and Lose Control, but there isn't really a skipper on this disc.  <br /> <br />May I say that the artwork and packaging design for this entire album is simply stunning! I love how the inside booklet is part of the digipack and the artwork inside has had a lot of thought and effort put into it, it's almost like a mini book!  <br /> <br />What is lacking here are the memerable guitar riffs which Fallen had, for example the intro to Whisper, who could forget that? This is a very solid album but it does lack the stand-out tracks which Fallen had, and therefore I am giving it 4 stars. It isn't quite a classic like Fallen, but it could have been so much worse. I have much respect for Amy Lee experimenting, taking her time and not going soft. It was worth the wait!
B0000648WZ|3.0|This Video is okay.  The special effects used in this movie is quite entertaining.  The kids think's it's great if you like watching a movie where the enemies are cockroaches.  Have a bathroom break and fast forward for brief nudity.
B000HT386M|4.0|It probably won't take the smartest person to realize that my review of a Adam Sandler movie won't be the most unbiased review out there considering my nickname. But much like his other past dumb comedies, Click made into my DVD library. But unlike his previous movies, Sandler doesn't play the lovable loser. Instead he is a fairly successful architect who close to making partner and he already has the girl in the form of Kate Beckinsale (Serendipity) who seems to like to walk around in pajama short shorts and tight fitting shirt. <br /> <br />Okay, so not everything is perfect as he is having trouble balancing his family and doing enough at work to be made partner. The pressure culminates when he has to do research on Asian architecture so he can land a prestigious Japanese client only to turn on a remote control car while trying to play a video on the subject. So it's time to a universal remote so he doesn't open his garage door every time he tries to turn on the television. But the only place that is open at the time is Bed, Bath, and Beyond where Sandler has to venture into the Beyond where he runs into the last person you want to meet at the end of a dark hallway, Mr. Cowbell himself, Christopher Walken. <br /> <br />As anyone who saw the trailer can figure up, the remote that Walken gives Sandler is truly a universal remote as it gives Sandler the power to control his whole universe. He can fast forward threw fights with his wife, mute annoying people, and pause to kick someone in the crotch without them knowing (hey it's an Adam Sandler movie; you need your prerequisite object to the crotch). No remote control gag goes unused. Well except for close captioning. But anyways. Unfortunately for Sandler the remote comes with Tivo so it starts predicting his habits and starts to fast forwards even when he doesn't want to do so. And unfortunately for us as Sandler goes further in the future, the sappier the movie gets and almost plays out like A Christmas Carol withWalken playing all three ghosts. <br /> <br />But luckily there are plenty of fart jokes and other sophomoric gags that you would expect from a Sandler movie that keeps the sappy parts from being unwatchable. Plus Sandler brings in some of his past coworker who knock the comedy out of the park including The Fonz (The Waterboy), Sean Austin (50 First Dates), Terry Crews (The Longest Yard), and of course Rob Schneider who seems to pop up in every of his movie, but you will have to look in the deleted scenes to hear his catchphrase, \\"You can do it!\\" The best cameo though goes to James Earl Jones who you will just have to see the movie to see how he is used. But when it comes down to it, if you love Sandler, you will love this movie, but if you're not, you are complete and total tool and need to get a sense of humor.

0553382179|5.0|I found this book by pure accident some years ago. I would have never considered myself as being in the target group for \\"Sink Reflections\\" - I'm a liberal agnostic German holding an M.A. and just moved to Ireland after having worked in Marketing in London for 10 years. Then... I had children.<br /><br />I went into deep depression and while I love my kids dearly, I HATED being a mother and housewife. This was EVERYTHING I did not want to be - going from independant money earner, holding my own in the business world, to being stuck at home, not being able to relate to much younger moms in mother and toddler groups, and hardly having an intelligent conversation day in day out. I turned into a grumpy, ill tempered cow who snapped at her husband and kids, gained lots of weight, and generally sat around all day watching TV.<br /><br />3 years on, this has changed (except for my weight, still struggling with that one :). My house is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but now I get up, make my bed, have a relaxing time over breakfast (because clothes were laid out with shoes and coats the night before, and lunches were prepared as well), and after spending maybe 30min in the morning doing my routine, the rest of the day is mine to do with what I please WITHOUT feeling bad. If FlyLady does one thing, it's getting you to accept that you do not need to feel guilty about the way your house looks. My house is not company-ready, but it takes me less than an hour to get it there - that is HUGE progress!!!<br /><br />Another area in my life that has improved is that now I don't feel put upon for staying at home. I enjoy being at home spending time with the kiddies while they're still small, but it has also given me the opportunity to re-think my priorities and I have started my own interior design business rather than get back into the rat-race. I honestly don't think that without FlyLady, I would have had the drive and confidence to do this. I probably would have been another \\"if only\\".<br /><br />I'm not religious, far from it, but FlyLady is genuine in her belief, and I respect that. I'm seriously allergic to people stuffing their faith down my throat, yet with Marla, I never got the feeling that that is her motivation. Therefore, take it or leave, I like her, I respect her, and I admire her drive to get her message out to help all of us SHEs.ave been another \\"if only\\". <br /> <br />I'm not religious, far from it, but FlyLady is genuine in her belief, and I respect that.

B00004ZAV3|4.0|I was introduced to the Beatles with this CD when I was maybe 14.  It was the first time I ever heard of the Beatles.  I liked their sound so I illegally downloaded the rest of their cd's.  This CD is pry the one that most kids are subjected to in trying to pass this great sound into the next generation, and they could have done a better job especially with the first five songs.  The first five songs would be good songs for NSYNC to perform. I can just imagine Justin Timberlake singin \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand.\\"  They should replace the first five songs with more songs that showed the pure genious of the Beatles.  Songs like George Harrison's masterpieces \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", or \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". Psychodelic songs like \\"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds\\" or \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" would be better selections, especially with the decreases in heavy drugs that kids use now adays compared to the 60's.  \\"Norwegion Wood\\", \\"Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"Free As A Bird\\", and \\"Here, There, and Everywhere\\" would be much better selections then there early boy band music. They do included some great Beatle songs like \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" and the spectacular \\"Hey Jude\\". I understand that this CD could not have possibly included all of their amazing music, but they should have made better selections that showed off their complete range.  It is quite possible that this will be the only CD of the Beatles that young people will ever here.  They should be given a better selection of their music.

B00004TJKI|5.0|Anatomy of a Murder with James Stewart is not just another tired old story about a Jury struggling to reach a just and proper verdict.  Its not just about lawyers doing legal battle in the courtroom against insurmountable odds.  No it is percisely because the \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" DVD is so much more than the sum of its parts it would be difficult \ impossible for me to explain why it is so awesome in a full meaningful way in this so limited forum.<br /><br />In the context of speaking about a suspected rape the word panties was used in the movie.  Now you must understand this movie was made in the 1950's when such things had a shock value all their own.  When Anatomy of a Murder was made Rape, Panties, the motives of low common rakish men driven by base vulgar carnal animal passions or  other such subjects suggestive of anything even remotely sexual were never talked about with the directness and candor found in the movie.<br /><br />More than that the story told by Anatomy of a Murder is woven as a wonderful tale of small town bar room dives, fallen vampish ladies, seedy men and drunken sots all clamoring without much success to retain a already shreded razor thin vaneer of pseudo-respectiability.  Anatomy of a Murder is at once both a delightful mystery and a suspenseful thiller for those would would rather think about all the many dimensions and layers of intrique going on in a movie rather than be spoon fed a formulaic plot.<br /><br />The especially fine part about Anatomy of a Murder is that it explores and lays bare the most horrid sort of people without the movie itself becoming trashy or sensational.  Anatomy of a Murder manages to stay at all times respectable making you more than comfortable watching BUT, the people you see are so real muddling on with their tired flawed individualistic or selfish senses of humanity.<br /><br />Anatomy of a Murder is funny, tragic and sad yet not a downer because, you kind of like the people.  I am sure anyone watching the movie will see in the charcters people we have seen or know today which keeps subject matter in Anatomy of a Murder fresh even after all these years since it was made.<br /><br />To enjoy this movie you must have at least some thinking skills because the characters are rich and dynamic.  In Anatomy of a Murder Truth is one man's darling, another man's mistress sometimes loved other times set out on the street with the rubbish.  What happens when a good girl goes bad, can the village vixen have even a hint of virtue.  Who knows what happens on an innocent ride home when for many of their own different convoluted reasons truth remains nothing but a nodding aquintance to every character you meet in Anatomy of a Murder.<br /><br />Even Jimmy Stewart known for his good guy roles as the lawyer in Anatomy of a Murder is not always without taint he reveals that exposure a harlots song long enough will even stir the recesses of his soul.  As I said this movie is interesting and rich on many levels if you want to know more you just have to buy the movie at Amazon.com like I did.

B00005JPBP|5.0|Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman star as two young late 1890's magicians vying for preeminence on the London stage in the superb period piece, \\"The Prestige\\".  Director Christopher Nolan skillfully directs his cast through a fascinating plot abounding with unpredictable twists which he and his brother Jonathan collaborated on.  The artfully designed sets accurately represented Victorian England.<br /><br />Bale playing Alfred Borden and Jackman playing Robert Angier were friends and associates working under a popular magician of the time and also working on their own routines.  A mishap during a water escape trick performed by Jackman's wife Julia played by Piper Perabo caused her unfortunate drowning.  Allegedly Bale had tied a knot around her wrists that she was unable to undo.  Jackman blamed Bale and would seek vengeance.<br /><br />As they launched their careers each man would attempt to sabotage the efforts of the other.  This culminated in the loss of two of Bale's fingers during a bullet catching trick hampered by Jackman.  Bale, however, the superior magician, persevered and found immense fame with his unprecedented trick \\"The Transported Man\\".  Jackman tried to copy the ruse but could never perform it as well.  He became obsessed with stealing Bale's diary which would reveal the details of the trick.  Using his alluring assistant Olivia played by Scarlett Johansson, he tried to pilfer Bale's secrets.  His plans were thwarted as Johansson and Bale became lovers.<br /><br />Jackman finally coerced Bale into revealing that eminent physicist Nikola Tesla played by an intense, fearsome looking David Bowie, had invented a machine which juxtaposed science and magic and was the key to \\"Ther Transporting Man\\" illusion.  Michael Caine playing Cutter, the architect of Jackman's illusions, had his doubts.  Jackman nonetheless made his way to Tesla's lab in Colorado Springs, no easy feat at that time travelling from Europe.<br /><br />Jackman investerd hoardes of money into Tesla's creation to top the efforts of Bale.  Their cutthroat competition caused hardship for both men as the film concludes in an incalculable finale that concudes the flick on a soaring high note.efforts of Bale.

0316172324|4.0|I am reading blink for the 2nd time now due to the enjoyment I had when I first read it. It is a very animated and easy to read book that basically highlights several examples of our adaptive unconscious mind and how it works and comes up with decisions. He also dwells on the concept of thin slicing which is the predicting patterns and behaviors/trends by zooming in on the slices of experiences that matter the most and coming up with a rather unsconscious decision from it.. I really love the book and highly recommend it. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because it merely highlights how the process works but does not provide means and ways of improving our skills of the adaptive unsconciscous.. however the author points out to other works by authors like Paul Ekman and John Gotman and others that provide the next step...
B00008EY65|5.0|Recently I was sitting home watching TNT, SCI-Fi channel or one of the many others and I happened across HellBoy.  I never watched it because, the title of the movie turned me off.  I'm disabled and I automatically don't bother to see movies whose titles suggest negativity or insensitivity to people \ creatures \ whatever just because, they are different from most others.<br /><br />I had run into HellBoy a few other times on satilite networks and did not watch it for the same reasons given above.  One day I had one of my brutish biker friends over and of course while looking in passing at TNT HellBoy was about to came on again and don't-cha just know it he wanted to see Hellboy.  Normally I am a gracious host and would have stayed to watch with him but I excused myself saying fine I will go do something else till it goes off.<br /><br />After a bunch of high spirited yelling with him asking that I watch and just give the HellBoy a movie chance I agreed.  I sat and watched this hellBoy movie I just knew like for sure I'D LIKE TOTALLY HATE!  I watched the Hell Boy movie and about 1/2 hour in I was loving it!  I understand the meaning of the HellBoy title of the movie now and as such can tollerate it more after getting to know the character but. I still see the DVD's title as a saddening thing.  I found watching the movie the HellBoy character is different from most people but, he is for the most part content with his life in general and thats what matters when it comes to living with being different so there is no need for any sadness.<br /><br />I did finally end up so totally loving this movie I brought 2 copies in all one for me and one for the biker dude who turned me on to this movie.  Funny I liked the message in HellBoy so much it is one of my most treasured movies in my collection.  HellBoy is definately top shelf fare it made me rethink a lot of things. I know admitting this makes me weird but movies I watch make me think, movies both enlighten and entertain me.  I think there is something good to learn hidden in every movie even if you must first dig to find it.  HellBoy was so good I did not need to dig long to find a vast bounty of treasure to love and learn from.<br /><br />Don't-cha just hate it when big brutish biker friends are right.  They never let this old gray wolf dude live it down either but thats the fun of friendship among us disabled folk!  Hope you give Hell Boy a chance, i found there is more to love about this movie than the title Hell Boy first suggests.  Buy Hell Boy for your collection I am sure glad I did!and entertain me.

B000HWZ4A2|5.0|I like all things about architecture anyway and this movie is so much more than just cold steel of buildings.  Yes it is a LOVE Story but it is more than that as well.  This movie shows it is not easy living with the ugly politics that make it painful to be a visionary genius advocating designs and concepts far ahead of their time.  Money focuses most intently on what worked in the past so anyone daring to look too far into the future is seen as a distablizing influence.  In the Monied world the idict is conform or die and be quick about it, and The Fountainhead is a movie about that lone awesome magical individual who goes against the conventional wisdoms of his time to champion new ideas that currently have no high powered corporate backers.<br /><br />I like The Fountainhead because, it shows that firm unwavering commitment to one's core ideals matters amd matters most when few of the current in crowd have the guts to stand with you.  The Fountainhead shows how far too many people let themselves be led like mindless sheep by a media, \\"that thinks it alone knows whats best for society.  The Fountainhead shows how too many people are content to live blind, bland uninspired lives steeped in a purposefully ignorance that in time saps their creative souls.  The Fountainhead is as much about art as it is a movie about architecture, The Fountainhead is more than a movie about love between a man and a woman, the The Fountainhead speaks to the human heart of man and why he creates.  True creativity like the human can not be constrained, corporate blinders are inconsistant with what any visionary person see's be they inventor, accountant or architect.<br /><br />I love this movie because, it embraces and celebrates the human hearts need for creativity to live at its fullest potential.  Is the movie perfect NOPE, but for what it is The Fountainhead is awesome.  I have been wishing and hoping the Fountainhead would come out on DVD.  I have the VHS version and I wear it out watching it.  Of course I will be buying the DVD of The Fountainhead and hope you treat yourself to a copy as well.  Watch The Fountainhead then go out and create something awesome that changes the world for the better!  Hey a old wolf dude can dream can't he!  Art, Passion, Creativity and Love are just four parts of the same thing to remove any one deminishes all that remain that is the message behind The Fountainhead which is why I like it and think you should buy a copy from Amazon.com like I did!ar it out watching it.

The only thing I disliked about the book was that Dawkins uses too many quotes. Over time this makes the read a little chopy, however it does help with the credibility of his assertions which would be useful in convincing theists. I would recomend the book ver very highly.
B00005JPAD|5.0|Please disregard any review less than 3 stars and \\"S. Seifert's\\" review below of this movie because about the only thing he/she gets right is that the movie is violent. It's a Martin Scorses film, what do you expect? Although The Departed is violent, no pens are jabbed into victims necks, and you won't come away after watching the movie thinking about the violence. You be thinking about the truly great parts. <br /> <br />While it's hard to say this is Scorses's best with all that he's done, it certainly has to be up there.  From start-to-finish, this movie will have you focused, engaged, and waiting on the edge of your seat to see what happens next and what twist the movie takes. <br /> <br />From the top-notch acting, to the dialogue, to the plot/plot twists, and the often overlooked soundtrack, this movie is brilliant to perfect in each of these respects.  Nicholson deserves a best actor or supporting actor nomination and should win for his villainous kingpin role and DiCaprio as usual has a strong performance. Matt Damon, for maybe the first time in his career (Mr. Ripley is about as close as it gets), plays a bad guy, but is convincing while displaying an \\"innocent\\" bad guy demeanor.  For the supporting roles, Mark Wahlberg steals the screen when he's in them, you can't take your eyes off Vera Farmiga(Running Scared, Manchurian Candidate), whose innocence among characters mired in crime shine's like her eyes, and Ray Winstone(Sexy Beast, King Arthur) is great as Nicholson's right hand man.  Dialogue, as always for Scorsese, is great with some of Nicholson's lines being Tarantino-esque.  Some reviewers have said the plot is confusing, but I think as long as you pay attention, it's not that confusing at all. It's pretty clear whose side everyone is \\"really\\" on, but the storyline takes a few U-turns that are just part of the reason why this movie is so good.  And like I said, the soundtrack is excellent from the numerous Rolling Stones tunes in it, to some AllmanBros., to Dropkick Murphy's highlighting the Irish-Boston theme, and more.  Simply put, some scenes in this movie are even better and more memorable becuase of the songs playing at that time and the soundtrack. <br /> <br />While, like in almost any movie, you could be critical about something like scene transitions and the such, I see no reason to not give this movie 5 stars. I went into the theater expecting a great story, plot, and acting (like any Scorsese movie), and left fulfilled in those aspects and many more. There is NO Marty Scorsese movie like this, which is something to think about considering all of the mob movies he's done.  Although we haven't quite gotten to the \\"Oscar Period\\" that comes in a month or 2 when they release those movies they expect to have Best Picture potential, this movie will almost undoubtedly get nominated. I can't think of a Tom Hanks or Russell Crowe movie that has come out yet this year, so maybe the Academy will finally give a Best Picture Oscar to Scorsese. After all, 36 Mafia has one, why doesn't he?
B000G759LW|4.0|I absolutely loved the song that was overplayed on the radio. I love that style of music. But, once I listened to the cd, it was a mish-mash of numerous styles of music. Wasnt sure if I liked that. It is nice that there are two cds to listen to. I enjoy about 3/4 of the songs.  <br />Only suggestion, listen to a sample of the other songs. <br />I am a huge Christina Fan, so I will always enjoy her voice anyway.
0060899190|5.0|I have bought maybe 8 of these books and may buy more if I think of other people who would want it. I have a few set aside for last minute gifts. It's almost like you can't have it out on the coffee table because people pick it up and refuse to put it down or socialize until I tell them that it's a gift for them and they can take it home.  Then they relax and we can get back to socializing. It would probably be best in the guest room or as a gift.There is something about it that is addictive: being a little fly on the wall and reading people's secrets, many of which make you squirm. Guilty pleasures.  It's very unique, and the times that I have given it as birthday gifts have been huge hits. People just love it, the husbands and the wives, both. I have seen people from age 36 to age 72 love it equally. It is maybe not for the more conservtive person who might be easily shocked, but other than that, it's a pretty universally unique and fascinating book.
B00012QKSI|2.0|Not sure about the complaints below about PM's Love Theme missing--my import soundtrack has it. (There seem to be at least three differnt love actually souncrtacks, so it might be possible to buy one that doesn't have the tracks you want!).  Mine matches the track listing shown above for this item.   However, Jump is not the Pointer Sister's version that was in the movie (it is some rather hollow faux disco number), the Billy Mack cut is not well-mixed nor is  All You Need is Love, where the instrumental additions in the chruch scene seem to have been cut out, giving a monotonous and repetitive chorus that goes on and on.  I LOVE the film and have watched it far too many times, but the soundtrack doesn't meet my expectations. Were I you, I'd save my money.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|This is a fabulous story, taken from a novel written by Catherine Gaskell. This production sticks pretty closely to the original text and in my opinion brings the characters wonderfully to life.  The story is a intense one, and the love story just as interesting as the one between Darcy and Elizabeth in \\"Pride and Predjudice\\".  Don't expect the same idealised views of England though,this is a far grittier and realistic period drama which captures the cold of the North of England beautifully.  My only critercism is that the final scene would never have happened in the 19th century and certainly does not happen in the book.  Although beautifully romantic, the final scene would have meant the total loss of Miss Hales reputation.  People simply would not and could not behave in that way in Victorian England.  That's not to say that it's not a lovely ending though.

1594481717|5.0|I keep this book right next to the Experience Economy by Pine and Gilmore on my desk next to the computer. Pink does a super job of outlining some valuable business trends. The right-brain phenomenon value to business is real. It is worth the read for anyone seeking business training but not sure where to turn next. There are some real-world exercises in the book. The paper-back version has even more of these.
0786890754|3.0|I must confess to being somewhat disappointed in Ahern's debut novel.  Her writing is a little weak, and her plot points can be confusing.  I am certain that her work will improve over time, as that's the nature of writing.  However, the best I can give this book is three stars because it just didn't hold my interest that well.
0307237699|5.0|By far the most inspiring politician of our age, Obama is more interesting for the affect he has on people than for the innovation of his ideas. What is audacious is not his policies but his willingness to reach across what appear to be unspannable chasms to find common ground and to touch the best in people. If he runs, he will light up this country in a way we have not seen in a very long time.<br /><br />When I first put a Barak Obama in 2008 bumper sticker on my car (in 05) it was symbolic. Today, it is taken quite seriously, and for good reason. This country is hungry not only for Obama's character and leadership, but for his inspiration and integrity, for his ability to bring out the best in a country after 8 years of a President who appealed to the worst in us.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.
0375703764|3.0|I'm not going to tell you about the details of this book, because I'm sure you know all about them by now.  What I will say is this - despite all the meta-fictional, graphic design, Stephen King meets Pale Fire pyrotechnics of House of Leaves, despite the peaks and valleys of pretentious, plodding nonsense and genuine, page-turning creepiness, the book falls flat because none of the characters in this story are interesting, none of them have any depth and none of them are sympathetic.  As well, while the story of the house and the Navidsons is interesting, Johnny's story is mediocre at best.  I'm sure that a careful reader could comb through House of Leaves and unlock all sorts of mysteries within the text and develop endless and fascinating theories about the story. For me, I didn't care enough about any of the characters to invest the time to do so.  Had Danielewski spent more time trying to create three-dimensional characters and a more compelling story for Johnny rather than writing endless footnotes, deciding on color patterns for certain words and penning trite poetry, House of Leaves would be the masterpiece that it has the potential of being but comes well short of.
0060899190|5.0|Every once in a while you run across a book thats so truthful you cry.  This is one of those books.  Sheer sincerity radiates off of every page of this incredible piece.  I can only say that this book should be a must have and be read often, with others.

B00008S2VG|5.0|This is one her best albums ever. Every song is consistent and beautifully written. There's a lot of guitar and the whole album has very personal and intense lyrics. I don't understand why people say this is a weak outing, but i think they all got their minds clouded with the controversy that surrounded American Life. I'm a huge Madonna fan but i have to say that although i love her music the albums i feel are truly consistent on the whole are Like A Prayer, Bedtime Stories, Ray Of Light and American Life! Listen for yourself she is great!

0375713751|4.0|\\"I don't know how she does it\\" is a relation of a life of a busy woman, Kate Reddy. Kate is a financial advisor in a well-to-do firm in London, has an architect husband and two children (a six year old Emily and Ben, who is almost a year).<br /><br />This book is not a real novel, it is more like an extended satirical feuilleton and it has all its properties. The heroine is a modern woman who is trying to find time in her life for both family and demanding job. Seems like a hot subject... And Pearson managed to get into the niche at the right moment.<br /><br />The tone and humor of the book is similar to \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\", except that the target is different (well, at the different stage of life, although I am not sure if of entirely different personality). The main character is an obnoxious woman with a psychological problem - she has to be better than everyone else around her, which is very annoying (especially when her husband, who does a lot around the house, makes pesto and she is jealous of his skill instead of being happy).  And she is the narrator, so we the reader gets to know a lot of boasting and her high opinion about herself. The explanation is simple - childhood trauma, with a special accent on the parasitic, neglectful father (how clich&eacute;, really).<br /><br />As a feuilleton, it would be great, as a novel, the book was beginning to bore me to death but luckily, towards the end it got better and more like real fiction book - the Chris Bounce problem was what kept me interested, the degree of absurdity and concentration of female bonding and solidarity made the book bearable (more than bearable, actually interesting, for me).<br /><br />And, after all, the ending is no surprise, but as a whole, \\"I don't know how she does it\\" is quite funny, and a good pastime,  especially for people who can relate to the problems described there.
0375833153|5.0|This is a darling story that my three year old son adores.  It is written with very simple text and illustrated with great pictures.  The story is about a terrible dragon who can tear down castles and defeat armies.  He carries away a princess from her castle (you get this part of the story from the illustrations) and carries her off to his cave. Meanwhile, George moves next door to the dragon... and he saves the day.  You see, the dragon is terrified of mice, and George is a mouse.  When George hops over to the dragon's house to ask for some sugar for his tea, the dragon flies off in horror (great pictures here) and George ends up living in the castle with the princess as her friend and \\"guard mouse.\\"  My son loves castles and knights and dragons.  I think this book also appeals to him because someone small saves the day.  A great laptime book!
B000002UWF|5.0|Louis Prima remains infamous for his over the top performances on the Vegas strip during the 1950s and 1960s. Keely Smith, Sam Butera and The Witnesses accompany Louis on this CD to make this a great collection of Louis' hit songs from the 1950s and early 1960s when Louis was in his prime.<br /><br />The CD starts with the medley of \\"Just A Gigolo/I Ain't Got Nobody.\\" This song pokes fun at the guy who sells romance and wonders why he can't find true love. Like most of the tunes on this CD, the melody is catchy, even infectious, and Louis gives heart and soul to the performance. Other playful songs on this album include \\"Jump, Jive An' Wail;\\" \\"Banana Split For My Baby;\\" \\"There'll Be No Next Time\\" with Sam Butera; \\"Beep! Beep!\\" which was inspired by the launch of the Russian satellite named Sputnik and \\"The Music Goes 'Round And 'Round.\\" There's another perk, too: This is the first time Louis' version of \\"The Music Goes 'Round And 'Round\\" was released on CD. Excellent!<br /><br />Louis' voice is rich, vibrant and overflowing with strength; he truly is a manic swirl of energy! Moreover, Louis is ably supported by a lot of great talent. Louis' wife Keely Smith accompanies him on several tracks on this CD. I agree with reviewers who comment that Keely balances out Louis' over the top, almost excessive energy. Keely sings \\"That Old Black Magic\\" with Louis; and she also accompanies him on \\"The Lip;\\" \\"Baby, Won't You Please Come Home;\\" the medley of \\"Embraceable You/I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good;\\" \\"Hey Boy! Hey Girl!\\" and \\"I've Got You Under My Skin.\\"<br /><br />Louis also puts his own stamp on other classic ballads including \\"Buona Sera;\\" \\"I've Got The World On A String;\\" \\"Pennies From Heaven\\" and the medley of \\"When You're Smiling/The Sheik Of Araby.\\"<br /><br />Scott Shea contributes great liner notes about Louis' career and personal life; and there are wonderful color pictures of Louis and his Capitol Records albums as well. You get the song credits along with the recording and release dates for all the songs on the CD. In addition, the sound quality is excellent; Bob Norberg scores a coup again with his digital re-mastering of these songs at Capitol Recording Studios.<br /><br />Overall, this is THE album to start with if you want to get acquainted with Louis Prima, Keely Smith and their peers. If you like this CD, I suggest you try the CD entitled Louis and Keely as well as the CD that offers two of Louis' record albums on one CD, Call of the Wildest/Wildest Show at Tahoe. Get this CD! I hope that you have as much fun as I did as you listen to it over and over again!  SMILEwith the recording and release dates for all the songs on the CD.

0060839872|5.0|The character Jake on 2 1/2 men was asked by his father what the book \\"Lord of the flies\\" was about  and he repied, \\"a really big fly.\\" Continuing with that thought, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is not about motorcycles and how to fix them. The book is an outstanding search of self and and the healing of a relationship. An old standard that holds up in time; it should be on a must read list with the best of literature.
630521610X|5.0|Scream is a movie that doesn't let go of the thrills and nailbiting moments till the end. From the now Classic opening scene featuring Drew Barrymore, to the shocking end of this great film.  <br />     The movie revolves around a character named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell). One night two of her classmates are brutally murdered and now the killer is after her. Police believe there is a connection between this killer and the one that killed her mother a year before. Slowly, people around Sidney start dying and she has to try to survive and find out who the killer is. <br />     This movie is mysterious in a way because throughout the movie, the killer could be anyone. You have no idea who it is until the end of the movie.  <br />      This movie also includes an allstar cast including Courtney Cox and David Arquette. <br />     I recommend this movie to anyone who loves slasher movies, or just loves movies period.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|Pink Floyd's 'The Wall' is one of the greatest musical stories of the era and this 25 year anniversary release was just as entertaining as it was back in the day. The free poster was a bonus too. I decided to share this one with my teenager and was delighted to see that she got just as much out of it as I did. DVD quality is perfect, Poster is great, and the packaging is excellent too. It took a little while to get here, but I expect that because I live in Whoop Whoop Australia.
B000G73UEU|5.0|the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic and, whether a fan of the Man or not, this CD should be purchased by all who have an interest in the diverse number of stars who complimented Him.  In this way, they can see the type of diverse mastery they, too, hold in this musical world.  I also attended the Came So Far For Beauuty concert in Dublin and was blown away by the artists present and their delivery of three and three quarter hours of music. <br /> <br />Mark

B0001CCXZW|5.0|\\"Gilmore Girls\\" could have easily been a bad show. A story about a mother and a daughter bravely going through life could have been pathetic, boring and uninteresting. But then the makers took an unexpected U-Turn - they made it a smart one.<br /><br />The most valuable part of this mother-daughter story is the dialogue. When Lorelai and Rory get in their zone, the audience is thrown inside a chaos of pop culture references, witty word-choices and genuine emotion. Most importantly, the audience is invited to be a part of Stars Hollow, the little city where the two Lorelais live with a bunch of other memorable characters. In order to understand the show, you need to actively participate in the discussions and issues of the show. What is usually something you watch while ironing the clothes, you are absorbed into the world of Gilmore Girls.<br /><br />This show is successful because of its cast. There is some fine acting involved, and although the cast is basically unknown, they make you care and follow their struggles without blinking. Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel are adorable and manage to cover all the minor mistakes that are made. After you see the whole first season of this wonderful show, you will be left with a sufficient amount of special features to become a Stars Hollow native yourself. The makers of \\"Gilmore Girls\\" did not take their audience for granted, and it has been proven before that a smart show is a good show. Why would the story of Lorelai and Rory be an exception?
B00000JHAU|5.0|Belle and Sebastian are a very recent discovery of mine, but I am severely addicted to their music. This album got me started, but I really don't think it's a five star album - but at the same time, it's not as low as a four star, so I had to round up. There are better albums out there, sure, even some by B&S... but this one is fantastic nonetheless. I highly recommend it.
0691126658|5.0|This guide has the best illustrations of the 20+ bird guides I own. If any book can make the problem of learning and distinguishing the roughly 1400 species in the region - Uganda, Kenya, Tanganika, Rwanda, Burundi - possible, this book is the one. A little heavy for the field, but contains only the essential material: species accounts and range maps on the left page, illustrations on the right. Even after some study I will still have to refer to the guide to identify which of the 38 species of Cisticola I am looking at, but with this guide the chances are very good.
B000G73UEU|4.0|I was at the Brighton concerts that these recordings were mostly taken from and as a reminder of two stunning nights of music they can't be better. Standout tracks include the two by Martha Wainwright, the two by Teddy Thompson, Perla Batalla's \\"Bird on a Wire\\", Rufus' \\"Chelsea Hotel\\"  and (from the Sydney concert) Antony's  \\"If it be your Will\\". Two major disappointments though; the inclusion of U2 as backing band for Leonard Cohen's own version of \\"Tower of Song\\" seems done for purely commercial reasons and doesn't work,  and the nonsensical ommission of Linda Thompson's sublime take on \\"Alexandra Leaving\\". Here's hoping it's included on the dvd release.

0307276902|1.0|This book could have been written in 200 pages instead of 400 if James Frey did not repeat himself a million times. <br />Although, the book is based on fictional characters the author could have developed the characters more by including more of the occupants from the treatment facility and told their individual stories to make the story flow and make the book more interesting instead of being so repetitive. <br />This book however, did shed some insight on what addicts go through during detox. <br />He could have been less descriptive in the sections where he described getting sick and throwing -up, and the very graphic descriptions he gave when taking his stitches out; even though his tactic was to show how brave he was, the reader could tell that it was all in his addictive mind! <br />This book would be an encouragement for someone who is an addict and need something to pull them into reality to show them that they can kick their addiction and change their life before it is too late, like it almost was for James. <br />It was just an okay book and we hope James Frey's next book will be much more interesting.

B000A0GYD2|4.0|I too have both the original and this 'signature' editions of this great production, so I did the comparison test. There is indeed vertical loss of picture in this \\"widescreen\\" version. It's been cropped. The picture quality still remains quite good however. The fact I have both versions should tell you how highly I regard this show. Even though the episode on Apollo 13 is quite lame, this series remains a remarkable achievement, the very best thing to come out of Hollywood in many long years. But if there is indeed a true 16:9 version, this isn't it. More marketing hype.

B000HIVO64|5.0|First of all, concerning the guy who said that Beck is ripping off rappers from 20 years ago, Well, It's like comparing a Model T with a new Lexus. They may have invented rap 20 years ago but it was in a raw form. (Actually, Rapper's Delight from 1979 was the start and that was quite good). Beck has refined with subtle nuances and sonic innovation the art of pop culture. Whether it's rap, rock, pop, Brazilian Tropicalia, folk etc., you can count on Beck never being boring. This album ranks up there with his best. I listened to it for the first time yesterday and came away with the idea that in 2025, this will probably sound like everyday music. Right now, I'm hearing snippets of that on some TV commercials. Even Barbara, my wife, sat up and took notice and said \\"How come we don't hear this on the radio, down here?\\" Every song on this CD is different and innovative. Beck is a production genius. Just buy it! You won't be dissapointed.

B000FVGMC4|5.0|Paolo Nutini is a Scotish singer/songwriter, who is amazing.  I started to listen to him while travelling in Ireland this summer.  His lyrics and voice are soulful and remarkable for someone so young.  It is a shame that American audiences do not know him already.  His song \\"Last Request\\" is definately one of the strongest on the album, which includes some more pop inspired tunes like \\"Alloway Grove.\\"  The entire album is great - no low points to speak of - it is a great purchase and well worth the investment.  Buy it now - you will not be disappointed.
B00005JPBD|5.0|There is a great scene in Pedro Almodovar's latest, \\"Volver\\" that encapsulates all that this wonderful, resonant movie is about: Raimunda (a sexy, earthy Penelope Cruz who has never been better on screen) sings a gypsy/flamenco style song, having not sang in public for many years but in possession of a gorgeous singing voice, while her mother Irene (the legendary Carmen Maura), thought to be dead , discretely listens from afar. Almodovar's camera cuts between mother and daughter, both totally committed emotionally to the scene, both recalling their former lives together, estranged for years but still possessing that particular brand of love that exists only between a Mother and her daughter, both longing for lives without trials and tribulations and fear, lives without problems, without cares. \\"Volver\\" (which means to return, to come back) is nothing if not about returning to the innocence of youth: to a time when Love abounded and came without a price and without consequences. But \\"Volver\\" is also about second chances, re-tooling you life albeit, Almodovar-style which always involves some manner of the strange, the violent sometimes and the weird. This line towards re-tooling/re-imagining your life is not a straight one by any means but a zigzagged one going from \\"a\\" to \\"g\\" more often than from \\"a\\" to \\"b.\\"<br />In \\"Volver\\" we have the extraordinary character of Raimunda played to the hilt by Penelope Cruz who has always been better in her native Spanish than she's ever been in her English films. Raimunda is strong, decisive, hard-working, married to a lout, a devoted mother and sister of Soledad (Lola Duenas) with whom she shares a strong bond now that their parents are dead.<br />\\"Volver\\" is a film almost totally without men except Paco, Raimunda's husband and Paula's (Raimunda's daughter)father who leaves the film early on and as such it reminds me of the Neo-Realist film classics of the  WW2 era, \\"Open City\\" and the Sophia Loren starring \\"Two Women.\\"  But in this world without men that is \\"Volver\\" nothing seems amiss because the world that Almodovar has created is rich with well defined woman's roles: compassionately written and more importantly profoundly and deeply executed by the ensemble of actors that Almodovar has assembled: Cruz, Maura, Duenas and Blanca Portillo as Angelina.<br />Once again with \\"Volver,\\" Almodovar has returned to the world of women alone and it is a film primarily about but definitely not only for women: their power over us, their weaknesses, their hopes, their desires. But \\"Volver\\" also shows us that mysterious inner core that all women possess which gives them an edge, a wisdom that men don't have. Call it maturity, call it a security, call it a special strength. You can even call it \\"feminine intuition.\\" But, call it what you like, it's there, only women have it and lucky man, Pedro Almodovar is on a first name basis with it.without men that is \\"Volver\\" nothing seems amiss because the world that Almodovar has created is rich with well defined woman's roles: compassionately written and more importantly profoundly and deeply executed by the ensemble of actors that Almodovar has assembled: Cruz, Maura, Duenas and Blanca Portillo as Angelina.

B000EULJLU|1.0|Tool is new to me, having been introduced to Laterus in 2005... This new album 10,000 Days is off the chain.

B000GRUMPU|1.0|To those of you thinking about buying a movie about a sea disaster, this film is in no way worth they money.  Buy the original instead.  When compared to this dud, the original is a classic.  And besides this film does not have the famous death scene with Shelley Winters.

Anybody looking for a quick fix book on fighting theory is going to have to look elsewhere. This book is not just a guide to a style, but also a total indepth philosophy of FIGHTING.  <br /> <br />Great stuff!

B000002O5L|4.0|This is one catchy album which saw Tom step away from the Heartbreakers brand of rock and roll and venture into a more pop orientated scene. Jeff Lynne co wrote tracks and produced this album, one of a string of his successes as a producer. <br /> <br />This album, is catchy from start to finish, some of the songs are below par but such as the musical spirit, lightheartedness and joy, they come across, each as catchy radio hits. <br /> <br />Free Fallin', I Won't Back Down and Running Down a Dream were solid hits from this release and are up there with his most popular songs especially for the 2nd generation of Petty fans. They are concert staples and are songs that gained him further respect as a songwriter and thrust him to the top, all over MTV, he was hip again and rode the wave of success well into the 90's. <br /> <br />The Apartment Song was a left over from the early to mid 80's and the rest of the songs were written with Jeff. Initially rejected by the record company, this album turned out to be his 2nd highest charting and one of his best selling albums that was nominated for album of the year at the Grammy's. <br /> <br />This album for me ranks in the middle of his catalogue, there are alot of better albums, including his most recent and his earlier works. Pop fans will love this for the songs they always heard on radio, it is a good introductory/early album to buy for new fans. This album is in need of a remaster.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|\\"The Open Door\\" is one of those albums that you really try to like, but I obviously can't take it.  Amy Lee's vocals are deeply personal, but sometimes a little too personal.  It seems like this album mostly showcases her break-up.  Also, there aren't enough rocking tracks.  The only two I noticed are \\"Call Me When You're Sober\\" (which I am getting sick to death of hearing on the radio), and \\"Sweet Sacrifice\\".  If you want an awesome female goth band, I definitely suggest Lacuna Coil, The Gathering, or Queenadreena.

I have found this album to have more staying power than other highly praised works of recent times including \\"Time out of Mind\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\".<br /><br />Alot of credit must go out to Dylan's backing band who are excellent in providing tight and classy musical performances that are just as timeless and grandesque as Dylan's lyrics which weave in and out in phrasings and nuances that only Bob can pull off. His voice is in fine shape and he really works within its limitations by such great phrasing of the vocal lines.<br /><br />There is a good dose of true and heartfelt lyrics which supplement his recent themes of an old dog down and out on his luck trying to keep adrift of changes in society in love, religion and philosophy.<br /><br />\\"Workingman's Blues #2\\", \\"Ain't Talkin\\" and \\"The Levee's Gonna Break\\" is Dylan on his continuous search in trying to comprehend these modern times. These particular tunes, most in fact, are as strong any material Dylan has ever released in his career where he set the precedent of meaningful rock and roll.<br /><br />Dylan continues to set precedent and this album will be considered a classic for hundreds of years to come and is by far the best album released this year.<br /><br />Get this album which hit #1 in many countries, one of the few albums of modern times fitting of the honour.
B000ENWKN8|3.0|Rob Zombie's 3rd solo effort, Educated Horses, is his most disappointing album in my opinion.  The only worthwhile tracks are \\"American Witch\\" \\"Foxy Foxy\\", and \\"The Scorpion Sleeps\\".  The other cuts are just so-so.  I've always been impressed with Rob and had high hopes for this album, but I guess I was expecting too much.  Don't get me wrong, the songs aren't horrible, they just aren't that memorable.
0876852630|4.0|I found the book fascinating for its detailed description of life on the mean streets.<br /><br />It was very raw and seemed quite real.  But it was a very gritty book and was a hard read.  Anyone who calls this a humorous book didn't read it.
B000003TA2|4.0|Sonic Youth's Goo is a definite indie rock masterpiece.  From the opening \\"Dirty Boots\\", to \\"My Friend Goo\\" (my favorite song on the album because it's just so damn catchy), to the closing \\"Titanium Expose\\", this record has it all.  If you're just getting into Sonic Youth, I would recommend picking up this album and \\"Dirty\\".  It might take a little while to get into cause it's really different, but take the chance.  You'll be glad you did.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I've always liked Mayer's music, but never loved it until now. I almost bypassed this cd, I'm glad I eventually picked it up. Because surprisingly, it's easily one of the best releases this year. Mayer has really matured, and his genuinely heartfelt, poignant lyrics and singing are amazing. With such thoughtful, political tunes like \\"Waitin' on the world to change\\" and \\"Belief\\" (which will be one of my favorite songs forever), it's not overstating things to say he's truly become a voice for our generation. More personal tunes such as \\"stop this train\\", and \\"slow dancing in a burning room\\" are searingly honest and raw emotionally. Mayer and I are are of a similar age and I really can relate to his lyrics in a personal way. The music on the album is considerably different from his other studio albums. It's bluesy, maybe a bit funky at times, understated yet textured, and very impressive. And yes Mayer is an excellent guitarist, if that is indeed him playing on the album. A fantastic album, Mayer has really earned my admiration, I will anticipate each successive album from here on in.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I remember seeing this movie back in the 70's when it came out and the part with the Holy Hand grinade is hilarious, my son watches it and so does his friends.  It is a well made spoof on the Crusades that has stood the test of time.  It is for older children because of language and some sexual pictures.  It is a good funny film to watch on a friday night!

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|Mary Poppins is a classic Disney movie.  I remember watching it as a child.  I had this movie on VHS and liked it so well that I have recently replaced it with a DVD.  My eight year old niece liked the movie so I have purchased her one for Christmas.  Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke make it a wonderful performance for people of all ages to enjoy.  It has a mixture of cartoons with live performances that gives a it a twist for good family entertainment.  I hope you enjoy it as well as my family has.

B00005JPAM|5.0|\\"The Queen\\"  is, far and away, Stephen Frears' best film to date.  That's saying a lot since his \\"Dangerous Liasions\\" is one of my favorite films of all time.  While \\"Dangerous Liasions\\" is about power and cruelty,  The Queen allows you a glimpse behind the scenes of power, and illustrates that everyone, no matter how famous or how powerful, stumbles a little in life, and fortunately has a person or persons around them  that save them from themselves.<br /><br />A study in contrasts of style and substance is the theme of the film -- the events that brought together Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) and her new Prime Minister, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen).  Had it not been for the sudden, almost inexplicable death of the tragic Princess Diana, followed by the schism in terms of reaction between her people and the Queen, Elizabeth and Tony may have taken years to get comfortable with one another, years to understand each other, years to forge the kind of relationship that works for the UK.<br /><br />These two actors are brilliant in their roles.  Mirren goes beyond the traditional caricature of the Queen as stodgy, opinionated, and totally in control/disdain of her family members' lives and foibles.  She gives us the Queen as an extraordinary woman made humble by events she did not create and could not fathom.  Her reaction to them, her eventual awareness and response, is, for lack of a better word, queenly.  Mirren, the redoubtable Jane Tennyson of the brilliant \\"Prime Suspect\\" series, is the best actress of her time (yes, Meryl Streep, that includes you).  Michael Sheen, on the other hand, may not portray Tony Blair as he really is (how would I know?) but the contrast of his coltish, disarming charm and his leadership style at the beginning of his term as Prime Minister (and the obvious affection from staff and family,  for his ability to be real, to be the kind of leader that one would follow into hell )  to his growing confidence that he can, by the truth of his understanding and  his willingness to continue to persevere, to bring the tragedy from the brink, all of it is captured in his performance.<br /><br />Frears benefits from a brilliant script by Peter Morgan, but turns the script into an extraordinary film by the perfection of his choices and his editing.  He chooses to recreate scenes that have never been filmed (the crowd in front of the hotel before Diana emerged to her car and her subsequent death the scene of Charles arriving at the hospital) and mixes them with real film clips of Diana in life, and some of the real film of the funeral events.  Choosing NOT to recreate Diana with an actress was sheer genius, and the mix of clips and live action was incredibly well done.  Mixing the filmmaker's/writer's interpretation of what must have happened in the series of entreating phone calls between Blair and the Queen, making both vulnerable by showing little shots of daily life -- the cozy, contemporary chaos of the Blair house, the deliberacy of the Queen taking off and putting on her glasses, tells the story of how the power shifted between them (perhaps?) in a way that not even his fine actors could do.  Choosing  a breathtaking but not imposing score for the film and making the shots of Balmoral ( the almost forbidding surroundings) come to life as the barrier between the Queen and her people...well, Frear has taken what could be an ordinary, dull film about a living monarch to the realms of an incredible character study, played out against a backdrop that stands stark in the memory of people all over the world.<br /><br />Was the crown really endangered by Elizabeth's reaction to the tragedy?  Did she change her stance because of the leverage of Blair's campaign, his truth?  Is Frears film opinion, or is it reality?  Somewhere in the middle?  It matters not.  It's unique, it's powerful, it's a shame that it won't be viewed in wider release, because it is the best film, so far, this year.f his understanding and  his willingness to continue to persevere, to bring the tragedy from the brink, all of it is captured in his performance.    <br /> <br />Frears benefits from a brilliant script by Peter Morgan, but turns the script into an extraordinary film by the perfection of his choices and his editing.

0307237699|5.0|\\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is a personal introduction to Senator Obama: an auto-biography of his life from childhood to present, his family and his views and approach to politics based on personal experience, education and involvement which is diverse, well rounded, and extensive- he is both studied in law (he has been a practicing lawyer), American history, constitutional law, and foreign policy.<br /><br />Sen. Obama leaves no stones unturned as to where he stands on all major issues from faith, economics, environment, foreign and domestic policy, war (he voted against invading Iraq on very reasoned points of inherent, long-range repercussions). Although he has his feet firmly planted in liberal, democratic policies, he is not stuck in single point-of-view politics: he respects all points of view and considerations; he believes that policies on both sides of the isle can and do have merit and his bi-partisan voting record demonstrates this.<br /><br />He is a Christian, yet firmly believes in the sanctity and rights of all religions and the non- religious alike and that no particular religion should be infused into politics as the torch-bearer of  personal morality legislation in America- separation of church and state is a must, yet he also believes that  religious points of view and voice have a place at the political round-table.<br /><br />Sen. Obama feels that abortion is a woman's personal business and choice and he proffers that the best approach to prevention is universal sex education, rights to birth control,  moral guidance including abstinence as a choice, but without dogma and derision. And he believes that all politicians, especially liberals, should be more frank about openly discussing their moral viewpoints and \\"...values in ways that don't appear calculated or phony.\\" (p.63)<br /><br />Indeed, we have seen what vote scamming of the Christian Right with hypocritical, unfulfilled promises has wrought and it's enough to make one puke, yet we can also be thankful that the most extreme of those anti-constitutional rights wish-lists have not been fulfilled. Check-out David Kuo's new book \\"Tempting Faith\\" for an indept Christian \\"insider's\\" expose' on vote scamming of the Evanelical Christian Right by the Bush Admin.<br /><br />Over-all, I found Sen. Obama's approach to life and political points of view to be polarity busting, pragmatic, fair and balanced- a refreshing break from the status quo. I should think that people from all walks of life and persuasions can find much to appreciate in his thoughtful and reasoned approach to all matters at hand. The index is extensive and helpful in referencing his life experiences, politics and view points.xtreme of those anti-constitutional rights wish-lists have not been fulfilled.

B00005JPB4|5.0|\\"Flags Of Our Fathers\\" is brilliant! This is one of the year's best! It is an incredible tribute to the nature of heroism in America and to those men who commit these brave acts of heroism. Ryan Phillippe (as John \\"Doc\\" Bradley) and Adam Beach (as Ira Hayes) both give their best performances of their careers, Beach, especially worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Jesse Bradford (as Rene Gagnon) gives a great performance as well, but he doesn't equal Beach's and Phillippe's intensity in their performances. The directing by Clint Eastwood (who won the Oscar for his brilliant work on \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" (2004) is brilliant, again, and he deserves another Oscar nomination and possible win for one of the best films of his career. The screenplay by Paul Haggis (who recently won an Oscar for his work on \\"Crash\\" (2005) and was Oscar nominated for his work on Eastwood's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") & William Broyles Jr. (was Oscar nominated for his work on \\"Apollo 13\\" (1995), (which is based on the book by James Bradley, son of \\"Doc\\" Bradley, and Ron Powers) is brilliant, and deserves an Oscar nomination for their work on the screenplay. The music by Clint Eastwood (he also did the music to \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") is brilliant. The cinematography by Tom Stern (who recently did \\"The Last Kiss\\" (2006) & \\"Million Dollar Baby\\") is brilliant. The film editing by Joel Cox (who was nominated for an Oscar for his work on \\"Million Dollar Baby\\" & won the Oscar for his work on Eastwood's \\"Unforgiven\\" (1992) and has been working with Clint for 30 years) is brilliant. The casting by Phyllis Huffman (the movie was dedicated to her due to her untimely passing on March 2 and worked with Clint since \\"Honkytonk Man\\" (1982) is brilliant. The production design by Henry Bumstead (who worked with Clint since 1972 as art director and did the production design to Clint's films since \\"Unforgiven\\" and won Oscar for his work on \\"The Sting\\" (1973) & \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" (1962), his last film that he designed will be Eastwood's \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\" (2007), he, sadly, passed away, recently, on May 24) is brilliant. The art direction by Adrian Gorton (who also did the art direction to Clint's upcoming \\"Letters From Iwo Jima\\", and Clint's \\"Mystic River\\" (2003) & \\"Blood Work\\" (2002) & Jack G. Taylor Jr. (who also did the art direction to Clint's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Blood Work\\", & \\"Space Cowboys\\" (2000) and also started working with Clint on \\"A Perfect World\\" (1993) is brilliant. The set decoration by Richard C. Goddard (who also did the set decoration to Clint's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Blood Work\\", & \\"Space Cowboys\\" and also started working with Clint on \\"Absolute Power\\" (1997) is brilliant. The costume design by Deborah Hopper (who also did the costume design to Clint's \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Mystic River\\", \\"Blood Work\\", & \\"Space Cowboys\\" and also started working with Clint as costume supervisor on \\"Tightrope\\" (1984) is brilliant. This is a powerful and heartfelt movie about the realities of war and heroism and how it makes heroes and certain people think and feel. This is one of Clint's best, up there with \\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Mystic River\\", & \\"Unforgiven\\". When Oscars roll around, Clint will be remember on that night. This is a little bit better and a little more emotional than \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" (1998), which was directed by Steven Spielberg, who also served as a producer on this film. This is one of the best war films in years.
B00008WT5E|4.0|This album is great if you like the working class struggle sound. It contains some very good AC/DC tracks which in my opinion are: Rock 'N' Roll Damnation, Down Payment Blues, Riff Raff, Sin City, What's Next to the Moon. Down Payment Blues contains some of the most ingenius lyrics I have ever heard, it seems to have a dual message. For example the line \\"Got myself a sailing boat but I can't afford a drop of rain.\\" The song is about a person who has no money so therefore can't afford a rainy day. If you know anything about sailing in order to fill your sails with wind and get moving you most often need the rain which brings the gusts of wind. I think this last interpretation is analogous to the line in the song \\"Got myself a cadillac but can't afford the gasoline.\\" Overall though the album is worth the price you would pay here at Amazon.com, especially if you qualify for the super saver shipper.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|Incredible weaving of four stories that all tie together. Gaghan brilliantly executed the telling of a deep story with masterey. The cinematography, score, storyline, and characters are well-thought out and well chosen. It's a deep pool that requires close attention. I've seen it four times and just now feel as if I'm truly beginning to understand all of it. Can't wait for the next Gaghan film.

If you are someone suffering from outrage fatigue with what's going on in our country (that would be America, even though I don't recognize it anymore), you will totally love this movie.  And if not, regardless, it is a totally entertaining, thinking person's movie.

B00005K3NR|5.0|Still one of the greatest horror films of all time!  I remember seeing this movie as a little girl and it scaring me just as much as it did today.  The picture quality of this DVD is wonderful and it's definately a timelessly horrifying and somewhat sad story.  If you are a horror fanatic then you MUST own this film.  Also, lots of bonus material from the actors and director Brian De Palma on the making of \\"Carrie\\".  Worth your money!
B000024D4R|3.0|I like this CD, I think mainly becuase I remember listening to it when it first came out and it brings back memories.  But it is not one of Pink Floyd's best.  If you're just getting started on Floyd they have better stuff than this that you should start on.  Dark Side of the Moon is of course their best.  The Wall, Wish You Were Here, excellent.  Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Saucer Full of Secrets, great if you don't mind having an acid flashback.  Animals, though, falls a bit short.  Roger Waters says it was really just a kind of study they did for The Wall, and I have no reason to disagree with him.  It has its moments, but it's not great.<br /><br />Buy it if you're really into Floyd.  If not, don't.

0399241523|4.0|\\"Ark Angel\\" is my first go at an Alex Rider novel.  Even without reading the five preceding books, I enjoyed this one for what it is:  a spy novel for young adults.  Horowitz jumps right into the new story and explains previous plot lines enough for the reader to keep up.  There is virtually no character development or exploration; there are constant plot twists and turns.  Whether this is a positive or negative probably depends upon the reader.  If the reader is looking for a character to identify with, to journey with, to aspire to, Alex is a bit thin.  If the reader wants rollicking excitement without bogging down, this could be a good vein to mine. <br /> <br />\\"Ark Angel\\" reminds me of the theatrical \\"Mission: Impossible\\" films:  action driven, violent, uncomplicated.  \\"Three Days of the Condor\\" or \\"Manchurian Candidate\\" it isn't. <br /> <br />While Horowitz isn't among the top tier of Young Adult Fiction writers (J.K. Rowling, Robert Cormier, Lloyd Alexander, Gary Paulsen, Laurie A. Williams come to mind, but there are many more) but he's a competent craftsman who has extended Ian Fleming's 007 to a younger, contemporary audience.  I imagine that fans of Horowitz might eventually graduate to richer material.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is a movie we can watch with the kids and still find something new everytime we watch it. For those with kids, you will know that kids want to watch a movie over and over again. That can be tedious for parents - not so with Shrek and Shrek 2.
032147404X|5.0|I recently purchased a very nice digital camera for work. The one we had before was good for taking photos of our students for the roster, but every photo I shot of a live speaker or group events was just pitiful. So we popped for a Canon EOS Rebel XT and I figured I'd better learn how to use it. After all, what good is the investment if I still take lousy photos with it?<br /><br />Scott Kelby's The Digital Photography Book is every bit as straight and to the point as its title. Well let me qualify that slightly. While Kelby does get to the point, he doesn't do it with a straight face. His writing is infused with a sense of humor that worked well with me. I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this book. I just knew that I had a knack for taking ho-hum photos, digital or otherwise, and any instruction had to help. I guess I expected a lot of \\"use this kind of lighting\\" and \\"set your f-stop at...\\" sorts of advice. There are those kinds of tips to be sure, but there are also an amazing number of forehead-slappingly simple things and insider insights that make a world of difference.<br /><br />Kelby jumps right into the basics of how to get \\"tack sharp\\" photos, reasoning that \\"If your photos aren't sharp, the rest doesn't matter.\\" He starts out with the equipment you need over and above your camera to get the kind of shots you want - tripod, ball head, cable release, level, etc. I'm sure that will have many of you reaching to protect your wallet, but have no fear. In many cases he gives alternatives that you can use in a pinch. Granted, he generally represents them as what to do when you are caught without all your equipment, but they can also be considered low-cost alternatives. In most cases when he suggests new hardware he is very specific about brand and models he would recommend at various price ranges. I found this very helpful. It's one thing for someone to tell me to buy a tripod, but have you ever gone looking for one? Not only are the choices overwhelming, but the number of ways you can configure them are as well. Kelby makes it much simpler.<br /><br />After laying out the ground rules for equipment, settings and terminology he jumps right into a series of practical chapters such as Shooting Flowers Like a Pro, Shooting Weddings Like a Pro, Shooting Sports Like a Pro and more. He has chapters which deal with some of the problems and advantages unique to digital cameras and digital photography. Did you know you should bring extra batteries when you are shooting in colder weather? I didn't. He wraps up the book with two very useful chapters - How to Print Like a Pro and Other Cool Stuff and Photo Recipes to Help You Get \\"The Shot\\". The latter is just one shot scenario after another with the keys to making it work.<br /><br />Since I am such a novice I didn't know what I was looking for when I picked this book up other than tips on how to take better shots with my digital camera. After reading it I fell like I got hit with a Mack Truck full of tips. Lucky for me, I did get the number of the truck that hit me. It is \\"Scott Kelby\\" and I recommend stepping into his path as soon as you can!ng, but the number of ways you can configure them are as well.

0525948023|5.0|Tolle's Power of Now was perfect timing for me... 3 years ago.  I literally \\"woke-up\\" to the moment, and, in the process, saved a bundle on psycho-therapy ! <br /> <br />I thought that was pretty much \\"it\\".  However, and, of course, there are always an abundance of ways to grow, and A New Earth helps define (and refine) the direction. <br /> <br />Though I have quite spiritual a bent, my mind learned more about my own hungry ego than \\"I\\" had anticipated... A great distinction took seed. In the process, I (note to self: use term loosely) understood much more of how the world (especially power, \\"religion\\", and politics) is currently working than I ever have before - in ways that are interesting to my mind, but not nearly as unfathomable to my self. <br /> <br />Tolle continues to simplify much of the human experience, and in those simplifications helps others to see into and beyond the flesh-dance. <br /> <br />Not a book that I would call, even inadvertently, a \\"spiritual\\" tome (unlike Autobiography of A Yogi), Tolle helps remind us that, if we are truly in the moment, the NOW, then we are linking-up with the Spirit of the Universe, and... that's what we are here for. <br /> <br />I just finished it, and I'm about to read it again !

0684824906|5.0|Ms Goodwin skillfully recounts the incredible political skills Abraham Lincoln needed to keep a cabinet of egos and ulterior motives focused on carrying the nation through the Civil War.  Initially viewed by those whose advice he sought as an uneducated bumpkin, we realize by the end of the book that Lincoln was perhaps what Stanton articulated, \\"the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen.\\"  Mr. Lincoln's skill didn't lie in being an expert in all things, but appointing those that were skilled in their particular area, no matter their political leanings.  The author examines not only Lincoln, but the primary players in his political circle, their attitudes, background and motives.   <br />This is a superior work by a superior writer and historian about a superior president.  The best analysis on the sixteenth president since the Nicolay and Hay memoirs. <br />
0740748475|5.0|I don't understand how a product of this quality and size can be this cheap! I bought it as a gift for my wifes 30th birthday, and she was very happy. Some of the guests at the party showed a lot of greed though.:) <br />  <br />After reading it I can only say that Calvin & Hobbes has really stood the test of time well (in a way that some cartoons don't). I guess the arena of parenting and childrens fantasies doesn't change that much, and that Bill Waterson is a man of integrity - he had no need of commenting on current events through his art.
0553208845|4.0|Very insightfull, Hesse gives a very human face to the quest for enlightenment. In the Buddist tradition we often dont get to read about the struggles and conflicts in the lives of those who have become the enlightened ones. This is often because in India and Tibet it was(and is) the teachings \\"Dharma\\"  on how to attain enlightenment which were the important part of the Buddha/Guru/lamas life.The Buddha himself said his life story is the Dharma. But \\"we want to know of the author as an individual, and in this post-Freudian World perhaps we hope to see behind the wisdom to a tortured soul.(Crosby K.Skilton A.1995 S&aacute;ntideva The Bodhicary&aacute;vat&aacute;ra, A new translation..).Hesse gives us this insight into the life and spiritual struggle of Siddhartha.
4789011623|4.0|This book has been an excellent tool for learning written and some spoken Japanese on my own. The only real issue I had with it was that many of the nuances of the language, both written and spoken, are not fully explained or demonstrated. However, within the context of a class many of these issues would not exist.  <br /> <br />So for anyone who is interested in learning Japanese by themselves I would strongly recommend this book in combination with Pimsleur or Rosetta Stone or private tutoring or all together.
B000GTLQXU|4.0|I had never sceen the originial Poseidon but I really enjoyed this movie. The actors were great, especially Kurt Russell, Josh Lucas, and Emma Rossum. You don' thave to wait forever to have the \\"story\\" actually begin. Its action packed from start to finish. This movie will have you on the edge of your seats.
0060934719|4.0|This is a great little book -- a fairy tale with a twist.  There is an intelligent sweetness to it.  I think it fell down a little toward the end --  I would have liked it better if the darker plots hinted at in the beginning were not so quickly disposed of about two-thirds of the way through.  Not that I would wish darker consequences on the hero and heroine, but a little more complex working out of at least one of those sub-plots would have improved the book.  Still well worth reading.  Charming.
B000654Z2I|5.0|One of the most soulful and creative albums I have ever heard. Can's Tago Mago has to be heard to be believed. It is VERY ahead of it's time. Why this isn't mentioned in history books is a shame.<br /><br />Songs such as \\"Paperhouse,\\" \\"Oh Yeah,\\" and \\"Halleluhwah\\" bring out the more psychedelic and jazz/funk side of Can. Awesome drums abound, high energy jamming, and the energetic vocals of Damo Suzuki run throughout these songs. Mushroom has an almost industrial/Jesus and Mary Chain feel to them, predating the band by 12 years!<br /><br />Others such as \\"Aumgn\\" and \\"Peking O\\" are intensly dark and savage, leaving the listener with a feeling that he is seeing an acid experience of hell itself.<br /><br />Finally, the overall calm of \\"Bring Me Coffee Or Tea\\" wraps this weird world to a close, though it leaves with a big bang of explosive jamming.<br /><br />This is music for the soul. This band was truly pioneers of the avant-garde, and it is only just recently that they have gotten the recognition and praise they deserve. So, go to your record store and demand Can's Mago Tago, Ege Bramyasi, or anything by them! You WILL be rewarded.
0380789035|5.0|I bought this book to prepare for a discussion group.  I had never heard of Neil Gaiman before, and I am so happy to know this writer's work!  This book is a total delight.  Original ideas are scarce as hen's teeth, but Gaiman has one here.  It is one of the most innovative books I've yet come across.<br /><br />It helps to have some working knowledge of pagan gods so you can get the many subtle jokes woven into the story, but that's really not necessary.  It just adds another layer of joy to the experience.<br /><br />Gaiman is one of a kind and is surely one of the best fantasy writers I have read in a fairly long lifetime.
0316236551|5.0|This book has great, different, and easy ways to draw all kinds of faces.  Pictures are built step by step and include variations.  Very Fun!
B000683VI4|5.0|I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.<br /><br />This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.<br /><br />I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical \\"boy loves girl\\" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.<br /><br />The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the \\"rich man\\" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many \\"cliches\\" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.<br /><br />It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.<br /><br />Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.

B00000DR8R|5.0|This is the best album I've heard in years. I'm so glad I bought it. \\"Rattlesankes,\\" \\"Speed Boat,\\" \\"Perfect Skin\\" and \\"Charlotte Street\\" are simply brilliant songs, but of the whole album, there's not a loser in the bunch. It fits together and flows perfectly.  <br /> <br />The Commotions' music is close to a lot of what was bubbling underground during 83-87, such as Echo and the Bunnymen, REM, The Smiths and '86-87 Cure - all jangle-pop and silvery guitars. For his part, Cole pre-empts Morrissey's lyrical allusions and crooning by nearly a year. The lyrics are hauntingly high-brow and intellectual, but in playful, clever and endearing ways. <br /> <br />All-in-all, this album is an overlooked gem that has simply gotten better and better with each spin. I can't get enough of it. Brilliant.
B00001U03Q|5.0|It's Slow Hand at his best; what else does anyone need to know? <br />There's plenty of classic rock in \\"She's Waiting\\", \\"Bad Love\\" and \\"It's in the Way that You Use it\\" and a gentler, more reflective Clapton in \\"River of Tears\\", \\"My Father's Eyes\\" and \\"Tears in Heaven\\".  For the fans of Runaway Bride, you can find him crooning the beautifully sad \\"Blue Eyes Blue\\".  A personal favorite of any newly broken heart. Clapton's voice is both dusty and silken at times; soothing with just a little edge to it.  Not a song on here you wouldn't pay a lot more to hear.
B000H0MKOC|4.0|<br />The most surprising and refreshing thing about writer/director Jason Reitman's THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is that no one smokes--not tobacco lobbyist Nick Naylor, not the alcohol and guns lobbyists, not the investigative reporter, and certainly not the Vermont cheese senator. <br /> <br />This is a nutty and witty comedy satire that reminded me fondly of the 1940's Preston Sturges comedies, with their zany dialogue and flawless supporting casts.  SMOKING's key character, Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart in the performance of his career to date), is a tobacco lobbyist who is sympathetic.  Divorced, with a 12 year old son he tries to be a great role model for, Naylor believes that Americans have the right to smoke and the right to choose whether or not they will.  He knows he manufactures a product that causes death, but he can be wickedly hilarious about it.  Like with Cancer Boy on THE JOAN LUNDEN SHOW:  \\"Why would I want this young boy to die?  We would lose one more potential adult smoker.\\"  Then he invades an elementary school classroom, where one little girl tells him, \\"My Mommy says that cigarettes can kill you.\\"  \\"Oh?  Is your Mommy a doctor?  A scientific researcher?  Then maybe she doesn't have all the facts.\\"  This is a hysterically funny and inspired satire. <br /> <br />Curiously, the villain of the piece may be William H. Macy as the unpleasant Vermont Senator who sells \\"cheese that creates fatty arteries and heart attacks,\\" replies Nick.  Nick also has a reporter (DAWSON CREEK's Katie Holmes) want to do a story on him; the two end up as literally strange bedfellows.  Meanwhile, the head of the Tobacco Lobby, Robert Duvall, dies of lung cancer.  And the alcohol and gun control lobbyists keep fighting for Americans' rights to drink and fire guns, hopefully not at the same time. <br /> <br />The source here is a novel by Christopher Buckley and it must be a lulu.  It would be fun to know whether or not Mr. Buckley smokes.  I am a lifelong non-smoker with asthma.  Nick Naylor would probably say to me that it is my right and choice not to smoke, knowing the dangers of cigarettes.  The movie makes such a complex case for both sides, which is a tribute to director Reitman's brilliant screenplay.  One wishes both it and Eckhart's fabulous performance could be Oscar nominees next Spring for this 2006 comedy delight.  But the whole cast is a dream--Macy, Holmes, Duvall, Maria Bello, Adam Brody; and the dialogue is brilliant.  If you want a good time at the movies, don't even consider missing the wonderfully funny THANK YOU FOR SMOKING on DVD. <br /> <br />The movie is in Panavision and letterboxed on DVD.  Bonuses include a superb CHARLIE ROSE SHOW with Buckley, Reitman, Eckhart, and producer David O. Sacks; an audio commentary I do not recommend until a second viewing of the movie; two filmmaking featurettes; and deleted scenes with filmmaker commentary. <br /> <br />

0380977788|3.0|About halfway through Coraline I began to get the feeling that I wasn't reading a book, but that instead I was watching someone play a computer game where little Coraline goes about doing things - opening doors, chasing rats, dodging human-like grub creatures - in a well-imagined and creepy world.  A lot of things happen in the book; Coraline collects items, she explores rooms, she must listen to others for the proper clues...  and yet there are only a few moments when I thought \\"This is an actual little girl\\", a real person as opposed to a small figure who simply does things.    I suppose in large part the \\"computer game\\" feeling stemmed from the abundance of action combined with a near absence of inner conflict.  For instance the book would have been so much more interesting if Coraline had gone to this \\"other world\\" and not immediately seen how horrible it was.  Because even when she first meets her \\"other mother\\" and \\"other father\\", and they serve her a delicious meal that her real parents would never have the time and ability to make, there's still a lot she finds creepy and off-putting from the start - her other parents' hungry black button eyes, and the menacing whispering rats, among other things.  So even if her other parents do describe to her a kind of kid's paradise where they'll play with her each day, all day, and give her all the attention that her real scatter-brained parents often don't, Coraline is never truly tempted to stay.  The existence of such a temptation would have made the drama so much more compelling; it would have involved making this \\"other world\\" not so completely creepy from the start, and making the lure much more subtle.    Inner conflict was also absent from many of Coraline's decisions.  There are moments when she must call upon her bravery (and no wonder, given the things she must face), but each time she does so it's done without any apparent effort or struggle.  Her heart beats, yes, and her palms might sweat, but she pulls through each and every time.  I wanted her to be more human, to react more like a child would, to summon bravery only after failing to do so a few times.  I wanted to see more failure and false starts; she does, after all, wind up playing a high-stakes game against a rather terrible and devious creature.  The moments of cleverness and courage and wisdom would have meant so much more had they been earned rather than bestowed as automatic gifts from the author.      There was only one occasion when I felt truly convinced that this was a little girl shoring herself up with strength.  It's when Coraline is about to enter the other world a second time, in search of her real parents, and she reminds herself of the time she and her real father went exploring a gully, where they accidentally stepped on a wasps' nest.  She recalls how her father told her to run ahead up the hill, and how he stayed behind and got stung numerous times, just to give her a chance to escape first.  The description of that one episode - and Coraline's reflections on it - were so genuine and wonderfully written that I felt the lack of that kind of writing in the rest of the book.    Gaiman is strongest in his creation of this other world with its strange distorted creatures and creepy atmosphere.  Sometimes the creepiness isn't even from obvious things, but more from little gestures, like when Coraline returns from visiting her \\"other neighbors\\" and immediately finds her other parents waiting for her outside, arm in arm, staring at her with those black button eyes; they're not doing anything obviously menacing at this point, but the very image raises goosebumps.  I think if Gaiman had coupled his imaginative inventions with more psychological struggle and truth, the book would have been truly absorbing and even more frightening.
B00005JNS0|2.0|The car race industry is very good at cultivating new customers at an early age.  I wonder if the producers of \\"Cars\\" received some money from the business.    <br />Also, I wonder if tales of adorable cars are really the wisest entertainment choices we can make for our kids.  How much of a movie  like this is entertainment, and how much is PR for the automobile economy? <br />I thought \\"Finding Nemo\\" was a much better movie for kids, and it had a strong message about respect for marine life and care of the oceans (which are under duress due to warming waters). <br />I gave \\"Cars\\" 2 stars instead of 1 because I haven't seen the whole film, and maybe there are some aspects of the film that I'd appreciate if I looked more closely at it. <br /> <br />For a regular source of good media for children, I'd recommend \\"Mothering\\" magazine.  They review all sorts of good movies, CDs and books to entertain and educate young people.

B00000DRA9|1.0|Be weary of buying this soundtrack, true NES fans. As with what SingingBlueSilver said, the music for the arrival at the Ivory Tower, as well as other selections on this CD, is NOT what was on the original motion picture. I think it is a great injustice to not only the movie, but to us as well that the soundtrack is not composed of all of the original music.
0156027321|5.0|This book is an exquisitely written page-turner with a surprising double ending. I won't give it away but it takes the whole experience - the whole journey  - that the author takes us on, and leaves us with two options of how things really went down. I don't read books twice usually, but this one I could read again.  <br /> <br />Between readings, I started thinking like Pi, if it were me stranded in the boat, having to be resourceful. It took me away, into another world in which I begin thinking of how I would live my last days. Clearly the story has a successful ending because it was written in first person. So I kept hanging on every page to find out where he'd wind up and how he'd manage in the elements with very little supplies. <br /> <br />FABULOUS BOOK!

0618680004|5.0|Another great book by a great thinker. Unfortunately, I fear Dawkins and friends (Daniel Dennet, Sam Harris, et.al.) are doomed to fail in their mission of eradicating god and faith. Because being right is not as important as being easy. Dawkins has set the bar too high for both groups he is addressing - the 5% who think, and the 95% who think they think. He is not asking that scientific thinking get equal mindshare. He is not asking that we don't take the bible literally. Those things would fall short of the goal.  <br /> <br />For the 5% group, he is asking thinking individuals to rid their lives of the logical contradictions many hold dear. The chief contradiction being that rational thought and faith-based belief systems can co-exist. For the 95% group, he is asking they live their lives thoughtfully and rationally. This is, of course, asking too much. Those 95% are either willfully ignorant or just plain dumb. They are not capable of understanding evolutionary theory, scientific thinking, or 'what stands for an argument' even if they wanted to. And they don't want to. To the masses, the message of 'right-thinking' will go nowhere. There is nothing in it for them. Dawkins offers the masses nothing nearly as good as \\"God exists to aid you in scoring touchdowns.\\" and \\"Don't even begin to think you can lose weight without god.\\" Most real arguments are sound-bite proof. <br /> <br />The basic problem is that the message is necessarily complicated to be persuasive, rigorous, and beyond attack. This is the way scientists communicate. But at the same time the message needs to be dumbed down or most will just never get it. What to do? Dawkins strongly protests against religious indoctrination of children until they are old enough to have the mental faculties to make up their own minds as to what is right. Sorry, but 95% of children will never get that old.
1932100660|5.0|This book is not to be missed.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|My wife and I recently went to NYC on our honeymoon and I was thrilled that we were going to see PHANTOM OF THE OPERA and she was thrilled that we were going to see WICKED the following night. I didn't know ANYTHING about the show and I had never heard a single NOTE from any of the songs. From the moment the curtain came up, I was floored at the amazing show.<br /><br />Ever sense, I've been addicted to this CD. I would honestly say that the songs and the style of music is more suited for WOMEN or GIRLS, but regardless, the songs are catchy and fun. If you're a guy, just don't whip it out at poker night, while you're barbecuing or while you're watching football with your friends or something... that wouldn't be good.<br /><br />The night we saw WICKED on broadway, we saw Eden Espinosa as Elphaba and Kate Reinders as Glenda. This CD is the original cast of Idina Menzel & Kristin Chenoweth, among others. Yet, honestly, I didn't notice much of a difference. Both casts were phenominal. Both renditions were amazing.<br /><br />There isn't a single song on the entire CD that is forgettable. Each and every song is fun and will lock itself into your brain so that you never forget them. WHAT IS THIS FEELING?, DANCING THROUGH LIFE, POPULAR, I'M NOT THAT GIRL, WONDERFUL and the truly phenominal DEFYING GRAVITY.<br /><br />This is a great CD and WICKED is a phenominal show that will forever be an amazing honeymoon memory for my wife and I. See the show. Buy the CD. Especially if you're a fan of the stage.
0895260131|4.0|I learned so much from this book. It documented so many things I suspected and had heard about Islam, but had no real source for. I knew that the Crusades were not just about Christians looking for riches, now it has been documented by wiser men and women than I. <br /> For too many years, Christians have been taking a hit, blaming themselves, and becoming secular to protect themselves. It's good to have a true and far-reaching source for the truth about Islam.
B000FQ4M58|4.0|The return of Bat III was long antisapated.  Without breaking down every song, I will say the duets are great.  I wish \\"It's all coming back\\" was on Bat III as intended.  It was so overplayed when Celine Dion recorded it that it looses some of it's magic, none the less, a great duet.  \\"What about love\\"  shines also.  The only thing really missing are the Steinman songs that seem to twist words around as in \\"life is a lemon and I wasnt my money back\\".  Nothing that creative here.  Steinman gets credit for a handfull of songs, but wasn't involved in the production.  Desmond Child fills the shoes nicely though.
0743270754|5.0|This was an very interesting and readable book.

Recorded during their 1994 tour to support their then new album \\"The Division Bell\\", \\"Pulse\\" is Floyd at the top of their game, even without Roger Waters. There's tons of great performances, including an amazing set consisting of every song from \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", as well as bonechilling interpretations of \\"Cmfortably Numb\\", \\"Run Like Hell\\" and many other classic Floyd tunes. \\"Pulse\\" is definitely worth your money.

0385751060|3.0|Yes, Emil and Karl is great, and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was okay(reminded me of a sophisticated version Jane Yolen's Devil's Arithmetic inthat it sort of had a hook), but I can't believe people are reading andtalking about that book instead of Vive la Paris by Esme Raji Codell, the best book for teaching modern day kids about the Holocaust.  I saw Esme speak at a bookstore and she said she wrote this book to help children who aren't necessarily Jewish learn about WWII, and after I read it I knew itwould deliver.  The thing is that it really is written for middle schoolreadres, not just a YA book packaged for kids that is really for adults. Ibought six copies for my classroom to do a lit circle, there is so much todiscuss.  It is really brave and unusual and fresh, and I was more excitedto talk about it than I have been for a book in a long time. Hey somebodyout there read Vive la Paris and tell me what you think.  Better or worsefor young readers than Boy in the Striped Pajamas?

B0007Y08QA|4.0|Trevor Reznik works in a machine shop, which would be dangerous enough, but add to it that he hasn't slept in a year and has lost so much weight that he looks like a walking skeleton. The only constants in his life is the hooker he goes to on a regular basis and an airport cafe waitress. He talks to them and ponders what is happening to him. Things begin to spiral downward when mysterious notes start appearing on his refrigerator and a strange new employee named Ivan begins working at the shop. Everyday Trevor doesn't sleep he falls deeper and deeper into a psychosis that can't tell reality from fantasy. The revelation at the end of why he can't sleep is beautifully done and not revealed in any way earlier in the film. <br /> <br />The Machinist is blue in tone, both the look of the movie and the emotions of the characters and the soundtrack. It's a little slow in places but is also wonderfully acted and directed. Christian Bale is truly hard to look at and it makes you wonder what was going on in his mind when he decided to lose 60 pounds, down to 120, for the role. It definitely makes the character all that more believable and sympathetic, but it's also kind of crazy.

B00014TJ7K|1.0|Imagine you're a freshman in college, away from home for the first time in your life for an entire fall semester.  Your room mate likes to listen to Top 40 radio.  And it's 1987.  You would hear \\"I've Got My Mind Set On You\\" a million times a day for at least 3 of the months during the fall semester.  Every now and then you would hear \\"When We Was Fab.\\" <br /> <br />Later, during April and May of 1988, you notice a stack of this CD in your local used CD shops.  Do you know why?  This is the blackest, stickiest piece of pooh you will ever hear.  Jeff Lynne actual took a credibility hit and lost all the good he did by writing great ELO songs by producing this ball of dung. <br /> <br />Don't believe the hype.  GH was one of the Beatles, but this was probably a worse CD than Milli Vanilli's when it was released. <br />

0679446230|5.0|Things Fall Apart has been described as Africa's \\"best-loved novel\\", read widely not only in Nigeria where it was written in 1958, but across the entire African continent in schools; it is studied and taught in Europe in North America where 100s of papers and dozens of major studies have been written about it; it is said that in Australia and India it is the only African novel that most people know about. It has been called the archetypal modern African novel written in English. <br /> <br />The novel is about an African tribe along the Niger River that experiences British colonialism around the turn of the 20th century. The first 2/3's of this short novel establish the customs and day to day themselves the tribe, focusing on one man and his family in particular, known as Okonkwo. Into this arrive the \\"white men\\" who begin to change things, \\"things fall apart\\" leading ultimately to Okonkwo's death. The novel is not a \\"black and white\\" story of heroes and villains, of romanticized old-world customs destroyed by \\"modernity\\" and evil Europeans - the old customs had good and bad points, the British had good and bad points - even the hero of the novel, Okonkwo, is fairly unlikeable in many respects. This sense of balance throughout the novel, how everything has both good and negative aspects, gives it a great deal of believability and instruction. <br /> <br />Although we learn a lot about the specifics of the Ibo-speaking people along the Niger (historically accurate as Achebbe was born into that culture) the novel transcends the tribe, even Africa. It provides a realistic window into what it was like for tribal people who are globalized into western culture - from North American Indians in the age of Columbus, to present-day Amazonian first-contact tribes.

B00000K31Q|3.0|This is a well produced teenage-formula film, and for the genre, particulaly entertaining for young adults because it touches on issues such as relationships, the frustrations of young adolescence with great looking actors and a great soundtrack.<br /><br />The screenwriter's suggest that the movie is a modern rendition of \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\", a Shakespearean comedy, a story about the taming of a bad tempered \\"in your face\\" young woman into submission.<br /><br />As far as the film's connections to Shakespear's play, there are few.<br /><br />Watching the film again, there are only a small number of connections and they are vague at best; connections one can count on one hand.<br /><br />We have a bad tempered young woman and a suitor with a goal. There is a bet, something about \\"taming\\" the Shrew, but really, that's about it.<br /><br />The theme of the film is about attaining \\"true love\\", against seemingly unbeatable odds. However, Shakespear's play is about \\"taming\\" a woman, a nasty shrew, bending Katharine to Petruchio's will! Altogether entirely different themes.<br /><br />In the original play, Petruchio sees Katharine as a challenge, and once given her hand in marriage, abuses her into submission through starvation and intimidation.<br /><br />At the play's end, there is a \\"bet\\" between the men on whose wife is the most obedient.<br /><br />Petruchio wins the bet because he has essentially bullied Katherine into  an obedient, submissive wife.<br /><br />All said and done, this film is an entertaining teenage collection of clich&eacute;s' which really is designed to hold the attention of a young audience.<br /><br />Ten Things...is musically a good buzz, most the actors performing tongue and cheek with a typical, feel-good Hollywood ending.<br /><br />My only complaint, really, is the alleged connections to the 16th century play...because there is no substantial comparison...<br /><br />For a teenage movie, however, one of the better one's.

0967984602|4.0|This book on building mud ovens (also known as \\"cob\\") was easy to read and the illustrations were great.  The author explains a lot of history on where this traditional type of oven originated from and its uses.  I enjoyed the \\"back to nature\\" attitude of doing things with your hands and the community feeling of such a project.  Variations on this type of oven would fit into many lifestyles.  The bread recipes were good, but as anyone knows, baking bread is an art that must be practiced and refined over time; if you are desiring \\"Artisan\\" bread baking.  Pair this book up with \\"The Bread Builders.\\"

B000IFQLBE|4.0|Fogerty always brings coiled energy to his performances and this live CD a companion piece to the video concert (which in turn was a companion piece to the Greatest Hits CD that came out last year)is no different. Spread over two discs this covers a mixture of his best CCR material along with his best solo material. Some of the material from his last CD \\"Deja Vu All Over Again\\" is also included and although that album isn't among his best the energy with which he and his backing band play the material certainly makes it fit in with the classic material.<br /><br />As with the DVD the sound is terrific with John in exceptional voice. Certainly his voice has changed as he's gotten older (some of the material has been changed slightly to accommidate this but you'd never notice it unless you're a musician or singer)but in many ways its become a much richer instrument. Likewise his guitar playing continues to be direct and powerful acting as a perfect counterpoint to his material.<br /><br />The two CD set allows him to tackle some material that he didn't on \\"Premonition\\" and, although I prefer that set to this, both have their merits. Some of the material included here appeared on the Fogerty Greatest Hits compilation \\"The Long Road Home\\" although not all are from the same performances.
B000003CMB|5.0|In the 70's there were two albums that were mandatory for any quality record collection. Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" was one and of course the Allman Brothers \\"Live at The Fillmore East\\". An absolutely magical performance that was extremely well recorded to go along with an amazing musical performance. DO NOT HESITATE TO BUY THIS ALBUM, it is so good that I have bought it 5 times to replace the older versions. I have also bought it for younger people who think that Lynyrd Skynryd is the only band that defines southern rock. The Allman Brothers at the time of this recording were the best American rock band and you could make a great argument that they were also the best rock band in the world. Listen for yourself...
B000E8QVWY|3.0|We watched this multiple Academy Award nominee on DVD, having missed it in the theatre.  My daughter is a big Reese Witherspoon fan and my wife grew up near Nashville--so the movie seemed like a good fit.  I didn't find anything terribly wrong with it.  At one level it seemed a lot like \\"Ray\\", the biopic of Ray Charles, but maybe that's just because the lives of Johnny Cash and Ray Charles traveled similar paths.  The most surprising thing to me was all the fuss about Witherspoon's performance--she was a consensus favorite to win the Best Actress Oscar and did so.  Her singing was a nice surprise, but I thought Joaquin Phoenix was much stronger in his role as Johnny Cash.
B000002H6C|3.0|With the release of this album, it becomes clear that Metallica's song-writing abilities peaked with \\"Master of Puppets\\" and then started to go downhill. The tracks on \\"Justice\\" are still plenty heavy and filled with powerful melodic guitar riffs characteristic of their earlier work. In some cases, as in the tittle track and the album's instrumental, the riffs and guitar work have become even more complex and interesting than what came in previous albums. All but a handful of the tracks on this album, however, have a fatal flaw: boring vocal lines. No, I don't mean the text, which is often quite good. I mean the musical line to which the text is sung. For all but two of the tracks, the listener is subjected to Hetfield chanting words in a near monotone for what seems to be an eternity. Unlike the vocal lines of Metallica classics such as Master of Puppets, there is virtually no variation in pitch or rythm, just a mechanical slogging through the text. This makes some of the songs on the album (Eye of the Beholder, Harvester of Sorrow, Shortest Straw) too monotonous to bear. <br /> <br />The exception is the heavy ballad \\"One,\\" which I think can be counted among Metallica's best and does not suffer from any of the above problems. The same is true of the album's instrumental, \\"To Live is to Die,\\" which by itself makes the album worth purchasing. In this track, the listener is treated to a series of classically-inspiried, spanish-sounding themes seemlessly arranged into a coherent, almost symphonic masterpiece. Finally, the intricate and interesting riffs of the tittle track redeems it from the monotony of the vocal line and makes it an enjoyable listen overall, though far from the genius of the previous albums. <br /> <br />Others have pointed out the album's lousy production quality. My only comment on this matter is that while it is indeed poor, it is not so poor as to ruin the album.
B00005JOQS|3.0|Twenty-odd years have passed since the last Superman movie, so I guess it's high time for a new one for the new generation of moviegoers, like my daughter.  Having never seen any of the \\"first\\" series, she thought \\"Superman Returns\\" was great.  Having seen the first series, I wasn't so psyched by the return of the screen version of the Man of Steel.  \\"Returns\\" seemed to borrow much of its plot (and some dialogue, as I've read) from the original Superman; Brandon Routh borrowed his look from Christopher Reeve, and Kate Bosworth seemed too young to play Lois Lane five years after her tryst with Superman. Kevin Spacey brought more evil and less humor to the part of Lex Luthor, who's still obsessed with beachfront property--this time by creating a new continent in the Atlantic to push the ocean up and over the Eastern US.  Secondary players Frank Langella and Sam Hutchinson were just fine as circulation hound Perry White and awestruck Jimmy Olson.
B00005JPAD|4.0|Definitely the the type of movie that makes it worth going to the theater.  Very intense action and violence, twisting plot, lot's of misdirection.<br /><br />The story line is a bit overly whelming at times, this isn't a good movie to watch if you're tired and follow the action, the double crosses and the sometimes confusing who's who of the movie, but if you can just remember the basic characters the minor twists won't be too confusing.<br /><br />While it's certainly not a love story, there is that element, with a bit of a morality play going the whole time.<br /><br />I can't make some of the statements I'd like to make because I really try to avoid spoilers in my reviews, but I'll say that I enjoyed the movie even though had I been in charge it may have ended differently...<br /><br />All that said, if you like a thriller that has some rough and tough violence and a plot with a few twists and turns this film would be one I'd recommend to you.
B000FS9FCG|4.0|Natalie Portman was the major reason for my interest in this one.  Otherwise, I'm not a big fan of comic book movies, and might never have seen a very provocative and well-made film.  The near-future British setting recalls \\"Clockwork Orange\\", as does the man-vs-state story, although Hugo Weaving's \\"V\\" is a more admirable protagonist than Malcolm McDowell's Alex.  \\"V\\"'s V-alliterative soliloquy near the beginning and the overall production design are highlights, as is the history lesson on Guy Fawkes Day.  Surprisingly, Portman gets outdone by mask-wearing Weaving, who has the perfect voice for such a mysterious and threatening part.
B00006878K|5.0|Albert King is a blues master and \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" is one of his most prominent achievements.On this album the band consisted of all top-notch musicians a few of which would rise to stardom. There was Steve Cropper on guitar[Blues Bros.],Booker T and Isacc Hayes(Shaft)-keyboards, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn on bass, Al Jackson Jr on drums , and those Memphis Horns rounding it out. Booker T. and Donald\\" Duck\\" Dunn recently did work with Neil Young and toured with CSNY on their 2000 reunion tour.<br /><br />When you listen to this collection of songs you get an uncanny sense of deja vu. Like you've heard a snippet of a song somewhere before.For instance, \\"The Hunter\\" when King is singing \\" I've got you in the site of my love gun\\", immediately I recognized that line; However ,I remember it as Robert Plant bellowing it from \\"How Many More Times\\" off Led Zepplin's 1969 debut release. Or the style that Albert King had of talking in the songs. For instance \\"Crosscut Saw\\" he says \\"Now watch this\\" before breaking into a hot lead like he was going to do a trick and trying to get your attention. It made me think of Jimi when he would say \\"Move over rover, and let Jimi take over\\". And his guitar playing is profound,laying down a foundation for guitar greats like Jimi Hendrix to build their stellar style upon. It was with great insight that Bill Graham, the founder of the FILLMORE EAST and FILLMORE WEST had Albert King billed with the psychedelic San Francisco bands and white blues bands rising out of England in the late 1960's. Groups like the Yardbirds ,Cream [Eric Clapton] ,Led Zepplin [Jimmy Page], The Jeff Beck group, John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers. Albert King is quilted throughout the blues we know today making his contribution legendary. If you love the blues I strongly recommend \\"Born Under a Bad Sign\\" as a worthy addition to your collection.
B000J103PC|2.0|I read the book and saw the movie, which other than title and major characters, have little in common.  I can't say I really liked either.  The book is a little funnier. My major learning from the whole project was when \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" taught me about \\"roman a clefs\\", of which \\"Devil\\" is one.  Perhaps if I had more interest in the fashion industry, I'd have been more fascinated by the inside look that \\"Devil\\" provides.  Meryl Streep is very good as the apparently soulless Miranda Priestly, editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, but somehow she's never quite devil enough.  Anne Hathaway is passable in her second (or third) \\"made over princess\\" role.  The minor characters, including the wonderful Tracie Thoms as \\"best friend\\" Lily, are mostly wasted.

But this book doesn't just teach Patterns. It focuses on teaching OO principles as well. The patterns are such OO gems that they are quite inspiring. <br /> <br />Maybe it's just a reflection on me, but I found this book enlightening even as a CS graduate, and as a Sun Certified Java Programmer. The benefits to a young student would be even greater.
B00000IQW3|5.0|I had told my son about The Last Starfighter for years.  He grew up with the new Star Wars movies and playing video games.  In spite of this movie's lower budget, my son, at the age of 19, really enjoyed it.  It is good family entertainment. The storyline is fun, and the special effects are pretty good, considering they are a little outdated.  I would highly recommend this movie for a fun family movie night.

B000000OAA|5.0|Queen kicks major on this album.  This album shows Queen getting more comfortable with their signature sounds and going out on limbs that hold fine and never seem to break.  Sheer Heart Attack in my opinion is the album that broke the mold for them.  They were getting their first wings and flying into the operatic type ovetones of a later album that gave them their breakthrough.  Every album Queen puts out is precisively perfect.  Think RUSH without the ethereal soundscapes.  Very much in tune and very much the musicians they are.  What I like most about Queen is that everyone writes songs and are equally distributed in each album.  Roger, Freddie, Brian and John can write songs and each one in their own right have had hits.  The main focus of Queen always seems to me, to be of equality not found in most bands.
031286504X|1.0|I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid....I also read the book first and thought it was one of the best reads of my life....I recently bought a new copy of the book and still liked it very much....however I also recently purchased the movie version and it was TOTALLY laughable.....one of the worst movies I have ever seen.....so bad I suppose it could be a CULT CLASSIC in the same vein as ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES or REEFER MADNESS.....don't waste the money if you expect anything otherwise!
B000000OAC|4.0|Queen never ceases to amaze me.  They come out with every album and it is always different from the last. It always is a good thing with them to.  They take the chance and it works everytime!  News Of The World is just that.  It is news that queen know how to work the gammut of ballads and rockers just the same.  This album is like a nice drive by the twilight of the moon.  You can put it on and just kick back and feel the energy.  Never worry that It's Late or that you may just have blood on your face.  It is a solid album that carried them into the history books and sports events for a millenium and more.  What I enjoy most about Queen is their sweet timey type tunes.  Sleepin On A Sidewalk is reminiscent of Bring Back That Leroy Brown from Sheer Heart Attack and just melds together.  Don't be the person in your group of friends who doesn't have this classic album.  It is classic Queen for everyone to enjoy, even the ones who like the newer albums.  Get it, drive with it on and get some blood on your face.  LOL!
B000G759LW|5.0|I was very pleased that she went the extra mile and included 2 CDs worth of music.  All the songs were perfect.  I loved every single one of them.  I would recommend this for men, women, and any age older than 16.  Some songs contained sexual content.
B000000OA6|4.0|I've been a fan of Queen for a long time.  Yes this was the last album they put out before Freddie Mercury succumbed to AIDS, but it is such a great album. This album does not have all the different arrangements as albums in the past.  It still rocks though.  People always give the earlier albums of artists more props than their more current stuff and it is a shame.  If you enjoy Queen's legacy give this album a go and really listen to it with open ears.  It isn't much different in reality to earlier albums.  Innuendo kicks with a punch and it was a fitting title for the end of their original line up and it did put a stamp on the 70's and 80's even though it came out in 1991.  Pick this album up and have a fun time.
0393327655|5.0|Rejecting religion is not about rejecting morality, its about rejecting irrational beliefs and what it leads to.  The entity of religion is just one of the many areas in our society today that needs true honest attention paid to it.   <br />I wouldn't say the topic that Sam Harris is talking about is anything new,  but its worth seeing how he goes through it in such logical, methodical and precise manner. Its hard to imagine anyone being able to really bring up any (good) arguments against it.   <br />Religion is more than a virus, it is an entity that has evolved many advanced survival defense mechanisms over the years.  One of the main ones \\"Faith\\", overrides our natural mechanism for accepting what is true.  This book, if properly applied, could be part of the cure.  The title of the book is fitting.

B000007638|5.0|Most albums, you can listen to every so often but spend most of their lives in the box.  This one has been spinning on my turntable since it came out, even squeaking through my 8-track (in the seventies) and it is one of the few albums I just never get tired of listening to.  For such an early live album, the sound is excellent.  And I remember when it came out, and there were THREE records in it--WOW.  If I remember right, this was the most expensive album I'd bought up to that time, and it was worth every penny.  Listening to it, one feels as if they are transported back in time to a seventies rock show, with all its enthusiasm and energy.  Wings was no Beatles, but it was a great band in its own right, and the mix of songs on this album is a perfect blending of Beatles songs, McCartney solo efforts, and Wings classics.  And it all works.<br /><br />Lovely sounds, the band obviously having a great time, playing well together to an energized audience.  One listen to this live classic will take you right back to the great days of arena rock when one of the greatest musicians of all time came to America and gave it a special show.

It arrived in perfect condition.  It weighs a TON, and I think that adds to the charm of it.  My son says each book is a \\"Tome\\".

0060794410|5.0|The book is an excellent analysis of several companies that were able to make the leap from \\"good\\" to \\"great\\" and STAY THERE!  Surpisingly only 14 companies met the strict criteria established by Collins to qualify for this study.  They made the jump and then sustained great performance for over 15 years.  In a very easily understood, yet technically accurate fashion, the author helps us see that being \\"great\\" may be a difficult benchmark for any company to achieve, but sustaining that greatness is  the best legacy a company's top leadership could hope to leave behind.

0307120007|2.0|I thought this would be a great first book for my son since it is a \\"classic\\" and all, but the hardbook edition isn't all that fun for baby. Each page has something that the baby can see and touch i.e. he/she can actually \\"pat the bunny\\" and feel a sonft, furry bunny. Some pages are just too harsh, for example one page says baby can feel daddy's stubble or something like that, and there's a picture of a man shaving with a piece of sandpaper on his cheek! Needless to say, that page is too harsh for baby's soft skin and he didn't really like that. Other pages tell baby to put his/her finger inside a hole and do some other activities which are just bland. And the colors throughout the book are rather pale. Baby likes a lot of his other books with more mirrors and colors, and books that are soft so he can eat them!
0671015206|1.0|The sub-header to this book could very well be: \\"All Work & no Play makes Jack a Dull Boy\\".<br /><br />Basically, Tom Stanley's scholarly treatise on American wealth comes down to this mind-ripping, continent-blasting conclusion:<br /><br />Millionaires, you see:<br /><br />1) Save more than they spend;<br /><br />2) Don't spend anything.<br /><br />That's it. Page after page, chart after chart, graph after graph, anecdote piling up on anecdote, all of it boiling down to the same conclusion: don't spend more than you save. Clip coupons. Hang on to your wife `til Death you do Part. Buy a rambler for 80 grand, and cling to it like a rat clutching a Big Mac in a hurricane.<br /><br />To wit: if you're a good little Bob Cratchit, and burrow down in your suburban Dacha, drive the Civic, eat Top Ramen, and take your vacations at the State Museum of Knitting & the Fine Arts, you'll die loaded!Sound like fun?<br /><br />Didn't think so. Look: you've got one life, and after death all bets are off. Sure, you could be hauled up by the angels to Paradise, or it could just be one plate of linguini too many, a nasty flatline and one vast inky void of non-consciousness. Either way, you're looking at one single trip on this not-so-flat Earth, so you might as well live large.<br /><br />It's true, now: you can haul in major bank in whatever profession you choose: eremetic horror-writer, Wall Street tycoon, Railroad baron, small-town librarian, legal eagle defender of the Criminally Insane, whatever. And you can always outspend it. That is the source of endless tragedy and Dickensian woe throughout the ages, without a doubt.<br /><br />But there pitfalls at the other extreme. Listen: I live next door to one of these McMillionaires. The guy is this enfeebled little wizened gnome of a critter, used to be a bank Vice President and got bought out because he was a dingus. Total skinflint. Miser. Goes on his own hunting trips and brings back venison, deer meat, which he forces his family of---jesus, I think 12---to eat for months. Lives in a shacky little rambler, buys used Crown Vics from the local police department and bargain basement prices.<br /><br />The guy, no doubt, is high net worth. But he's also a loser.<br /><br />This is a guy who didn't want to cough up a few hundred bucks to help build a joint fence between our properties---so there's a fence, even a fence that abuts his property---but beyond my house and demesne, he elected not to build a fence. Instead, he got a plastic Jersey Barricade (orange and white) and went with that. Is that any way to live? Is that really what it means to be a `millionaire'?<br /><br />I think not. Half the glory of the Age of Great American Consumption is buying stuff you don't need, but want. Desire. Demand. What else is work for?  Find a way to creative bliss, work at something you're good at, that you have a real passion for, and the money will follow.<br /><br />But for the Love of God, it's only Money: spend it! What is money for, if not to indulge yourself?<br /><br />Sure, get a pace---plan to the end---set a budget. But how many of you want to be that newspaper column on page A3, the 95 year old dowager pauper who begged for alms on the streetcorner, ate catfood out of a tin, and scrounged for quarters by the bus stop, then was found rigid and cold in the urine-stiff sheets of her dirty bed, sprawled atop a fortune estimated at 20 million bucks? Sound like a plan? I think not. Money may not buy happiness, but it sure as hell can get you a Rolls-Royce Phantom.<br /><br />\\"Millionaire Next Door\\" might have it right in its sociology---and for what it is, Stanley's thesis is meticulously researched, mustered like a well-trained army, and capable of marshalling its teeming forest of facts like a well-drilled martinet---but it's off the map when it comes down to the point of the whole thing: if you've got it, flaunt it.<br /><br />\\"Millionaire Next Door\\" isn't a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods alongits own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap! Die loaded!), and perhaps some folks will be astounded to discover there are some real richies down the block who in another day would have been called skinflints.<br /><br />But as a map to your stars, this one is a little cramped, cribbed, dank, and stinks of mothballs. I think I'll take first class---scratch that, how much did you say that Learjet was going for, again?<br /><br />JSGt a bad book: it's scholarly, and plods along its own hand-me-down lodestar towards its prophesied conclusion (be cheap!

1878424319|1.0|The author borrows from several world belief systems and tries to pass them off as ancient \\"toltec\\" wisdom.  It does contain sprinklings of common sense, but the common sense is offset by impractical application as well as impractical implications.  Furthermore, the author contradicts himself at times.  On the other hand, if you are a fan of Deepak Chopra you will probably like this book as it is in the same vein.

B000I2JKEC|4.0|I watched the HD version of Superman TMP today.  PQ is very good for a film from this time period.  It was filmed rather soft and that does not always lend itself to HD, but the colors are nice and it's an improvement over the DVD.  Not a great example of HD-DVD, but a very enjoyable HD movie.li-[=]=[ <br />
6305511055|5.0|This movie is well worth your money and time.  The leads, Redford and Dunnaway, have excellent chemistry.  The script is taut and well written. The tension will keep you alert and focused on the movie and anxious to find out how the movie will end. <br />I highly recommend this film, and if you enjoy smart thrillers you will too.
B00003CXDD|5.0|This is a terrific film when I was younger and it still is. When I don't have anything planned Saturday mornings; I watch this most of those times. Highly recommended!!!
0066620996|5.0|I lived in Colorado for twenty years, consequently, I feel a kindred spirit with author, Jim Collins.(who has offices and lives in Boulder, Colorado).  Also, I have done consultative work for two companies mentioned in the book for comparative analysis. I learned many things while reading \\"Good to Great\\" and give it my fullest endorsement.<br /><br />One of the keys to success mentioned in the book is the \\"Culture of Discipline\\", which becomes even more dynamic when combined with entrepreneurship. Basically it means having a plan, picking the best people to implement it, and giving them some control over the outcome.  It is an interesting and informative book that challenges many of today's business climates.<br /><br />It proves definitively you do not have to leap tall buildings with a single bound to have a great company. A tall ladder will do - as long as you take one step at a time (please forgive the metaphors).  My favorite quote from the book is: \\"Greatness is not a function of circumstance, it is largely a matter of conscious choice.\\"<br /><br />Readers will be surprised, motivated, and inspired while discovering the profiles  of modern day great leaders (Level Five). They are fiercely competitive, self confident, and not afraid to show humility.<br /><br />Harry Truman was right when he said: \\"You can accomplish anything you want in life, provided you do not mind who gets the credit.\\"  You can also take your company and life from good to great - if you buy this book<br /><br />Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com
B000EQ47HC|4.0|Originally put out in 1978,this was the arena rock king's second stellar album.It's(of course)their follow-up to their mega-seller self-titled effort(see my review)and just about as outstanding.Maybe it's me,but this CD reissue is ALMOST like a movie sequel.Most happening cuts here are the title track \\"Don't Look Back\\",\\"A Man I'll Never Be\\",\\"Feelin' Satisfied\\",the unforgetable late night FM radio staple \\"Party\\" and \\"Don't Be Afraid\\".Ever wonder WHY Boston took two years to make this follow-up?Here's my theory:all eight tunes on 'Don't Look Back' were actually recorded at the same time the self-titled lp was.They just wanted to wait long ENOUGH to release 'Don't...' in order to hold their fan's interest.Even IF this were the case,it doesn't matter.It's all good.Timeless area rock that holds the harsh test of time.A must-have.
0743201140|4.0|Just when I figured I had seen it all, \\"Now Discover Your Strengths\\" comes along with a new outlook and a dynamic paradigm. A unique difference from others in its genre is the \\"Strengths Finder Profile\\" (can be interfaced on the internet).  It covers many different personalities of leaders with concentration of five dominant traits.  Chapter 4, page 83, does a fascinating job with detail explanations of thirty four \\"themes\\" of leadership.<br /><br /> If I may paraphrase Vince Lombardi (the legendary football coach): \\"In practice I do not worry about what other teams are doing. If we concentrate on what we do best, the game will take care of itself.\\" I found that philosophy to be the essence of this book.  Focus on your strengths instead of trying to change weaknesses.<br /><br />It is amazing how many companies make this mistake with their employees.  When trying to improve sales, and reduce turnover, they focus on the weakest link (the bottom) when more productivity can be realized by rewarding, emulating, and promoting the best producers.<br /><br />Those who have been obsessed with what is wrong in their lives will discover a better way is to learn what works best for themselves and others. The authors' ideas are motivational, inspirational and can be implemented by anyone.<br /><br />There are some revealing comparisons in the book to another prototype leader (Warren Buffett). Readers will be surprised and infinitely impressed with the key reasons for his success.<br /><br />This book should be a must read for anyone in a leadership position looking to improve the bottom line. It is very well done and has no comparison.  Reading it gave me strength, buy it and discover yours!<br /><br />Reggie Johnson, Success-Tapes.Com
B000067DNC|5.0|Stargate is basically good sci-fi and while watching the episodes in order does add some good references to previous episodes.  It is not necessary for enjoyment.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never caught all the episodes when they were airing on tv. It's really nice to be able to watch them in sequence.  Some shows characters are able to endear themselves to the viewer and I think this is the case here.   <br /> <br />I tend to like quirky series and I think this fits that bill to some extent.  The Serenity movie that was released afterwards is one of my favorite sci-fi movies.   <br /> <br />I don't think you can go wrong purchasing this series. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. <br /> <br />

But this book covers all the bases, from biscuits to breads, cookies to croissants.  Of course, great color photos for nearly every recipe.  This covers all the basics and then offers some nice variations.  This is indeed a \\"handbook\\" for baking basics and beyond.
B00005NWM3|5.0|Recently started listening to Nickelback. Great songs with messages behind each song about the problems affecting our society today. From drug and alcohol abuse to domestic voilence to cheating these songs cover issues that matter and are sung with emotion and feeling. Two of the best songs are \\"Too Bad\\" about a father and son relationship that goes sour and \\"Hangnail\\" about a breakup between a couple. \\"How You Remind Me\\" and the song \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" tell about other bad relationships. Other songs talk about broken hope and lost dreams.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I was expecting to hate this film.  I didn't hate it, but I didn't like it very much either.  It's nothing really special.  The plot is extremely simple.  3 guys go to Europe to smoke pot, have indiscriminate sex, smoke more pot, drink, and have more sex.  They go to Slovenia, where they get abducted by some locals who runs a business (for lack of a better term) where they entertain wealthy clients by allowing them to torture and kill people.  Do places like this really exist?  Probably, but it's best not to think about those things.  Is this film any good?  Roth builds up a nice sense of dread when you finally get to the torture palace, but that's it.  The film has a great premise, but the execution of it is pedestrian.  The 3 protagonists aren't as boorish as some people have suggested, but you don't really get to know them too well.  They're never developed as real people, just stock movie characters.  This film doesn't have any substance or depth to it at all.  And what's more the film has absolutely no sense of humour.  I like horror films infused with a dark, cynical humour, like the films of Romero, especially Dawn of the Dead and The Crazies.  This could have easily been one of those.  There are too many coincidences, and some very unbelievable scenes (the one where one of the protagonists gives a bunch of vagabond children candy to kill some of the torture guys is so ridiculous).  Roth is trying to emulate Takashi Miike (who has a cameo here), but he doesn't have any of Miike's sense of depth, substance, and sadness (a lot of people miss those things in Miike's films).  Miike is a real artist, as opposed to Roth, who just wants to show a lot of gore and T & A.  I have seen worse gore in other films.  There are other films out there that are far superior to this.  Start with anything from Miike's catalog.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|This is without a doubt the best concert video I have ever seen.  It has more focus on the light show than individual members of the band, but with a Pink Floyd concert that is what you want.  I originally had the VHS of this show but had to have the DVD as soon as it came out after many viewings my VHS was showing wear and tear.  The sound is also great on this DVD.  With my 5:1 surround cranked up it is quite awesome.  Do yourself a favor and don't hesitate to snatch this one up right now.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|Love this series.  SG-1 is great, but Atlantis can easily hold it's own as an independent series once SG-1 is no more. Loved season one and can't wait for season two to come out on dvd--sometime . . . . eventually . . . .
B000BH4YFE|5.0|for some reason, Marc Bolan never has recieved the fame in current day United States that he should of. This album is a classic and one of my all-time favorites. the first time i heard it, it was so overwhelmingly good i didnt know how to handle it. now, every time i hear it, it gets better and better. if you are interested in listening to T. Rex, go for 'Electric Warrior' first, then this 'The Slider.'
0441013597|5.0|Dune is said to be one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written and I happen to agree. Labeling it as merely science fiction, however, is to sell this work of imagination and insight far short. Dune tackles many of the problems encountered in the human condition, the perennial conflict between free will and fate being perhaps the most interesting question examined. Herbert masterfully drops the reader into this existential question along with providing great insight into the nature of religion and politics, how the two are related, and why people easily combine the two. Overall, this is a masterpiece deserving of careful reading, thought, and eventually many re-readings.
B000GTLQXU|2.0|In my opinion, this is really a shallow, insipid and utterly stupid movie, even by Wolgang Petersen's standards.... Iwas extremely dissapointeds withe the mess. You simply don't care if any of the characters will survive or all of them will die. And as for the impossibility of 99% of the things that happen in the movie, well, it's just escapism, but they exaggerated a LOT in this department...
B000FL7CAK|5.0|The concept of a teenaged girl private eye may not grab you, but the dialog and characters will.  Reminiscent of the works of Joss Whedon (Buffy, Firefly), Veronica Mars is the brainchild of Rob Thomas (Cupid).  Most of the acting and the relationship development are far better than we typically expect on TV.  The pop culture references are added fun.  I watched the entire season in one weekend - and I'm not the target audience.  Finally, a show that does not insult its audience!  (Catch it now, because - of course - its renewal status remains in jeaopardy)
0345440900|5.0|I'm a routine based person, so I found Hogg's routines helpful. During those hazy days post-birth, I was relieved that all I had to do was remember an acronym and I could figure out what I was supposed to be doing.<br /><br />I was comforted by her discussion of breastfeeding because it didn't go well for me.  In fact, it was a spectacular disaster and knowing that it didn't always work for everyone made me feel far better than the other breastfeeding materials I read which suggested that I was a failure if I couldn't breastfeed.<br /><br />I found her discussions of the types of babies helpful even though most kids seem to move between a few types. Overall, it's in the top three books that I will be giving friends who are having babies.

0895260131|5.0|To all the reviewers who gave this book negative ratings: did you actually read the book?  It's filled with quotes from Islamic theologians themselves, proving the author's points.

B0000636NQ|5.0|When you want pure talent, electronically unmodified because they're that good, this is for you. Ten Years After \\"Undead\\" - live, recorded in the kind of venue our (USA's) George Thorogood would play, up close and enjoyable.  Alvin Lee's soulful rapid fire guitar is loud and fast.  Rick Lee (drums), Chick Churchill (keys), and Leo Lyons (bass) also get their share of solos in this collection of swing jazz, rock, and blues.  I bought the vinyl version thirty some years ago, could only play that at home. Now I own this clean, digitally re-mastered work of art on CD which is one of my favorites to play while traveling.
0743298020|4.0|This book has a story of Margaret and the story she writes for a dying author, Vida Winter. I don't like to read books with a story within a story, because authors don't do well with the transitions. Setterfield did a great job transitioning between the two. The stories were smooth. This book supposedly has \\"ghosts\\" in it, but it's not at all spooky and if you're quick to piece the puzzles together, there's no \\"twist\\" at the end.  Or rather, you won't be surprised or disappointed with the ending- Depending on your take of the story. The beginning was a little slow for me and the last chapter cheesy, (I would have been happier not reading that part), but lose ends are wrapped up. Setterfield wove a wonderful yarn. It's not one of my favorite books, but I'd recommend it. I'd also read another book written by Setterfield. I've given four stars-mostly for the smooth transitional writing and secondly for the story, which kept me intrigued enough to keep reading. BTW:  I enjoyed Aurelius and couldn't stand Hester.
B00000JPYD|5.0|This recording is excellent, Trower's best work, with bonus live cuts.  That alone makes it worth buying.

Ray's voice is so classic its fresh, lush, rich and powerful, I'm going to break my steering wheel pounding away to this stuff.... I get lost in this music and suggest you join me in the kaleidoscopic world of flashbacks, flower power, Jesus Joggers, combined with Ottis Reddings soulful thunderclap... Did I say that? I don't know where that came from? maybe from the top of the LAmontagne I climbed when I heard this work!  LOVE IT!!!  TOP PICK OF 2005!
B000G73UEU|5.0|Excellent choice of artists to reinterpret and reinvent Leonard Cohen's tunes and classic lyrics.  Martha Wainwright's, The Handsome Family's and Nick Cave's interpretations stand out --made me go back to my Nick Cave collection and look for his own interpretation of Tower of Song.  Even those who might be a bit tired of Cohen's original mesmerizing, yet  at times monotonous, vocals will really appreciate this collection.  I look forward for more like this.

Audrey Hepburn play a blind woman during the 60's and her husband is traveling on business. He somehows gets inadvertently involved in a drug smuggling operation and the product ends up in Audrey's hands. Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna come to Audreys home to retrieve it. Audrey's performance as a \\"blind woman\\" was exquisite. She portrayed a vulnerable yet confident at times person. This is a 'timeless classic' Auidrey Hepburn movie. For all you fans it is a \\"must see!\\"

B000A6T1JU|5.0|Totally awesome movie.  One of my favorite cult movies.  Reminds me of when I first saw it, I was blown away with the whole honor concept that was somehow evident in some of the \\"honorable\\" gangs at that time, and which is plainly evident in this film.  The \\"honor & loyalty\\" concept is incorporated in many of the modern movies that have been and are being made.  Sadly, in real life, such a concept is becoming more outdated and obsolete.  Many expect it but even fewer practice it.  In any regard, I value my copy because of it and it's just a really, really cool movie.  The best part of owning my own videos/DVDs, like the \\"The Warriors\\" is that I can see them anytime I'm in the mood or I'm disillusioned with many of the modern trends that take away from an individual's humanity. It helps remind me that there are still people who value the practice of  honorable concepts like myself.  I treasure the friendship of these rare individuals whenever I come across them.  Thanks for allowing me this forum in which I can express my viewpoint about such a great movie.

With so much television and video games so many children are no longer using their imagination.

A wonderful book, with fun pictures.
B00005JPC7|4.0|Marc Forster is making a name for himself with such major films as Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland.  In Stranger Than Fiction, he takes a plot that could have been suggested by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) and creates a world that suggests fantasy yet is grounded in what we call reality.  It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars, Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal.   <br /> <br />IRS civil servant Harold Crick (Ferrell) leads a regimented, mundane existence, which consists of an orderly routine guided by his punctual wristwatch.  His solitary life becomes upset by the presence of a female voice that seems to be narrating his every move.  His daily rituals are altered and, when he audits a baker, a free spirited activist named Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), he meets stiff resistance and hostility.  Compelled to find the answers to the mysterious voice, he first consults the company shrink (Tom Hulce in a welcome, yet short performance), a therapist (Linda Hunt in too brief a role), and finally a literary professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman in bravura support).  It is with Dr. Hilbert that Harold finds hope and a methodology to solve the puzzle of the narrative voice.   <br /> <br />At the same time, famed author, Kay Eiffel, is trying to finish her latest novel about a taxman who is hearing voices.  When she struggles to find a suitable end for her character (all her principal characters are killed off in her books), a publisher's assistant arrives in the name of Penny Escher (Queen Latifah wasted in a pedestrian part).  Harold visits Ana for a followup audit and becomes smitten and attracted by her perky charm.  As he audits her maze of disorganized tax documents, Ana begins to feel bad for the poor soul and gives him a sort of peace offering of homemade cookies, and thus their relationship grows.  His visits with Dr. Hilbert begin to narrow the possible sources of his affliction until one day he stumbles on the answer and in doing so, he realizes that his life is predestined.  His life out of kilter, Harold begins to break out of his quiet shell and experience life's interesting aspects.  Kay's mental block soon gives way and when she finishes her novel and is ready to type the manuscript, Harold tracks her down using some creative ingenuity. She too has realized some incredible connection between her story and his real life. When Dr. Hilbert reads the final manuscript, his conclusions are a stunner to Harold.   How Harold and Kay respond to this is what winds the film to a tense conclusion.   <br /> <br />The dialogue is funny at times and always interesting.  There are traces of other films like Groundhog Day, Field of Dreams or an episode of The X Files that will come to mind.  The movie touches on the concepts of fate and destiny without being too obvious-perhaps it should have been more obvious come to think of it.  Do we control our lives or are we part of some other plan or manuscript (like The Matrix)?  The concept of `cause and effect' and of randomness figures heavily in the overall theme of the film.   <br /> <br />Harold is a sort of distant cousin to Forrest Gump complete with an innocent perspective on life.  His character works because his persona changes throughout the film and when he faces his fears and desires head on, his life begins to move forward in ways he never imagined.  He is starting to live life.  And when he finds out his fate, he makes a big decision that brings his character full circle.   <br /> <br />Harold's watch becomes a kind of supporting character, as it serves as a catalyst for him and Ana to bond, but it is used too sparingly at times.  There is a slight feeling that the filmmakers did not have enough confidence in the fantasy part to match the reality which is well done.  Too bad, as the film steadily progresses in its story and etches some interesting characters.   It also gets a bit confusing as to why a couple of characters pop in and out briefly, and you know it's for some reason that becomes more evident by the climax. <br />  <br />The movie is at its best when Harold warms up to Ana, and the two begin a courtship that is affecting and genuine.  In this, Gyllenhaal and Ferrell shine.  Will Ferrell has always been a dependable comic from his Saturday Night Live years, but here, he successfully portrays a shy, passive man complete with blank expressions and awkward body language.  Hoffman has his most significant role in years since his brief but memorable turn in Foster's previous Finding Neverland.  And Gyllenhaal proves adept as a romantic lead. <br /> <br />Forster is becoming a modern day teller of fables.  In Stranger Than Fiction he spins a simple tale (written by Zach Helm) of love, life, and fate with a moral that is redemptive and refreshing.  Not everyone will connect with this film; I suspect that the romantics out there will. <br />
B000GCFO0I|4.0|The secrets of Silent Hill are buried deep, hidden for years...and if the raw fear it creates to protect them is any indicator, it does not want them to be found.<br /><br />In the world of horror-themed video games, the words 'Silent Hill' have attained special status. The name itself evokes powerful images of foggy, abandoned streets, decaying buildings, and surreal creatures.  No surprise, then, that the movie based on the games made sure to include all of these elements, and to do it well.  The film has its own failings and its own successes, to be sure, but it is most successful in establishing and maintaining the look, feel, and texture of the games.<br /><br />For the most part, the story also remains true to the spirit of the games. It is different in many details, but the themes and emotional resonance is the same. Pervading the film, just as in the games, is an overarching feeling of loss and hopelessness, confusion and panic. Right from the beginning the audience is offset and in unfamiliar territory, and that feeling is only built upon as the story is told.  The story of Silent Hill is always one of reality merging with the darkest of fantasies, and the viewer is left to sort out which is which even as the characters are assailed with discovery after shocking discovery.  Don't be surprised if you are left with more questions by the end of it than answers.<br /><br />While the movie is mostly consistent and delivers well on its potential, there are a few missteps.  Perhaps the most egregious among them is a drawn-out and overdone \\"big finish\\" ending, with lots of gory effects and violence geared towards satisfying an audience hungry for blood.  For those few minutes, the subtleties and nuances present until then are gone as a bloodbath ensues.  For those few minutes, what makes the games so great isn't there, and it works against the film too.<br /><br />The movie does recover itself, though, even after the awkward denouement of the action.  Returning once again to the spirit of loss and making an emotional connection that makes the games work so well, the final scenes of 'Silent Hill' are quiet and understated but undeniably creepy, effective, and tragic.  These last few minutes manage to redeem the film and end the story on just the right note -- a low, echoing, lonely note to be sure...but just the way it should end.<br /><br />As films based on video games go, 'Silent Hill' is quite probably the best of the bunch so far.  It maintains (for the most part) the spirit of the game while making a mostly-successful transition to a different medium.  The emotions, the look and feel, and most of all, the fear from the game are all there in the movie.  As scary movies go...well, to be honest, you've probably never seen anything quite like it.  And for that reason alone, it is worth watching.ning once again to the spirit of loss and making an emotional connection that makes the games work so well, the final scenes of 'Silent Hill' are quiet and understated but undeniably creepy, effective, and tragic.

B00006CXSS|5.0|OK, so this is probably the best TV mini-series ever created.  If you don't cry while watching these, you were either sleeping, or have the emotional intelligence of an inanimate object.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" (so named from a famous line in Shakespeare's play \\"Henry V\\") depicts the 101st Airborne - Easy Company's journey in WWII from Training, through D-Day, through Bastonge, all the way to the Eagle's Nest (Adolf's private house).  It follows individual soldiers, and is extremely accurate.  These are real people, not made up characters, which makes it even more amazing.  The ONLY criticism I have, is that the Orig. series which aired on HBO, had the people's names during the short introductory interviews at the beginning of every episode.  It was easier to follow the emotions when you knew which soldier was talking.  Other than that one minor criticism, this is fabulous \\"TV\\".  My hats off to Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg for producing this series.  But the real salute goes to the gentlemen in Easy Company, who gave the best years of their lives, or their lives in totality, to win a war for freedom.  Currahee!!
0143034901|5.0|This book draws you in.  You begin to read and it's too stilted, too arty, too pretentious.  Then the words start to flow, the images develop, the uniqueness of the adventure entices you.  And the characters - oh what characters.  Other reviewers are spot on with a comparison to Dickens.<br /><br />For one who loves books and movies a major enjoyment here is after you put the book down.  What if the book were a motion picture?  What if Sidney Greenstreet were available for a part.  Who would play the female roles.  Was there ever the perfect player for the lead?<br /><br />Tough to imagine any reader not being thrilled by this wonderful artistry in words that places the reader in a unique world of mood and intrigue.

0670034711|5.0|This book is such a lovely mixture of humor and insight that I read it twice within a 3 month time period (something I have never done before). Reading the book is like having a lively, engaging conversation with a close friend.  I have bought several copies of this book to give to friends and several of them are planning to give the book to their friends.  I have also recommended this book to everyone.  One male friend asked me if it was a \\"woman\\" book that only women would enjoy.  I thought about it, and decided that it is a universal story told from a woman's perspective.
6305922756|5.0|How many times have you seen  the \\"special edition\\" label in a DVD cover? Many times i`m sure, but that could mean anything. From new remastered picture and new digital audio to boring meanenless interviews, but what  about REAL extras? Like deleted scenes, outtakes, i mean real material that realy interest the viewer, and in this cult film's case, THE FANS! <br /> <br />Because this cult classic is a matter of real fanatism, we the fans demand all the spinal tap material that we can get hour hands on! And this special edition brings you all that and more. Not only typical extra  written material, like filmographies and bios, here you can find all the audiovisuals that weren`t used, tv trailers, movie trailers, commercials, interviews, and enough deleted scenes and outtakes to make a whole new movie of its own! I mean everything! fake interviews, presentations on tv shows, video clips, goofing-around trailers, a crazy audio commentary by the \\"band\\" during the film, you name it... Even the main page is commented by spinal tap!!!! <br />In conclusion, A REAL DEAL, don`t miss this edition. It`s not often to find a real cult classic movie in such a fine presentation loaded with such material. Amazing realy. Of course the digital and audio could have been better, but the movie is so entertainning that you can pass that!
B000AE8FZS|4.0|This Gentle Giant is a further example of evolution.  They don't sound as melodic as earlier releases, hence the 4 out of 5 rating, but still fine work.  Empty City and Give it Back are my favorite.   <br /> <br />I do miss the acappella work of Talybont from Free Hand or the overall sound of Octopus, but bands that do not explore new territory get stale.  Gentle Giant always had an original sound and was consistently entertaining throuought their career.   <br /> <br />A note to people (like me) who received the mono version.  Not only was it mono, it was only one channel.  The number on the spine for the stereo version is 357.  If you have 353, ship it back to DRT and they will replace it, no charge, in about a week.  The remastered disc is dynamically good and clean considering the source is 30 years old.  I agree with another reviewer on sound quality of the bonus cut, I tossed it.  I do appreciate the effort on the remastering for all the GG stuff.  I can finally replace my vinyl.
0440238609|3.0|I'll begin by saying that this is an engrossing series.  It is well written, much more so than Harry Potter, and quickly ensnares you in a web spun around a 10 year old girl and her journey towards, uhh, killing God, explaining string theory, becoming a sort of neo-Eve, freeing the tortured souls of all eternity, exposing monotheism as a fallacy, and several other rather impressive ends.    The problem at this point should be self-evident; overreach.  For some reason, Mr. Pullman is attempting to formulate a new epistemology in a series aimed at 12 year olds. There are strains of Cartesian dualism throughout the latter two books and I kept having flashes of Leibniz's \\"Monadology\\" as I was reading about self-aware, indivisible and irreducible \\"Dust.\\"  These are confusing topics when tackled by philosophers, slightly more so when done so by a CHILDREN's author.  What started off as a fun and intelligent children's series in \\"The Golden Compass\\" very quickly becomes a depressing slog into the tyranny of religion and church (Christians beware) and, moreso, an investigation of sin, redemption, the afterlife, and the nature of divinity...if it indeed exists.  Worthy subjects for sure but perhaps not for the target audience.    I rated the series as a whole not less than 3 stars because Mr. Pullman is a good writer, and I was engrossed enough to read the series in a couple of days and feel happiness and despair at appropriate parts.  I rated it not higher because what should have been a Chronicles of Narnia strained towards becoming a philosophical treatise.  The series is powerful and enjoyable in parts, but it is not for children.  I could not imagine giving this to a twelve, or even a sixteen year old, and not having them come back with some existential questions.    I look forward to reading some of Mr. Pullman's works if he ever decides to get \\"serious\\" and write an adult series.
B00005JPBP|4.0|The Prestige starts by telling its viewers to \\"watch closely\\" but even the most attentive viewer is bound to be tricked by this film's sleight of hand. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are two 19th century magicians who work as part of a magic act for Cutter, played by Michael Caine, who is brilliant as the veteran magician. When an act goes awry, Angier and Borden become bitter enemies and professional rivals, both going to extreme measures to exact revenge upon the other. Jackman and Bale both turn in great performances and are able to find emotion in scenes where other less capable actors wouldn't be able to. Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, and David Bowie all turn in memorable supporting roles that work much better than would be expected and help immerse the viewer in the mystical world that the characters inhabit. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan do an excellent job of being magicians as well with a script and direction that's all smoke and mirrors. Like Memento and Batman Begins before it, The Prestige is highly ambitious in its structure and successfully manipulates time to unfold the events of the story. This technique is very effective for building up the end of the film, the suspense of which beforehand is almost palpable as Nolan continues to reveal the right pieces of his act at the right times. Best of all, both Angier and Borden are given their own prestige at the end of the film, making their lives as tricky and sleight as the magic acts to which they so utterly devote themselves. Though all the clues are given to the audience, by the time the final act is played out most viewers will be bowled over, no matter how closely they watched.

B00005JPAD|5.0|Hugely influential and critically acclaimed director Martin Scorsese is notorious for his numerous gangster movies, including such time-tested classics as Mean Streets and Goodfellas. The Departed is his latest foray into the crime genre and is well on its way to becoming his best yet, despite the short amount of time it has seen in wide release. Set in Boston, The Departed focuses on the rivalry between Irish mob boss Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) and the Massachusetts State Police by way of the rats that have infiltrated both organizations. Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Collin Sullivan (Matt Damon), working for the police and the mob respectively, find themselves in constant struggle to keep their true identities hidden while tipping off their real employers. Before long, both Costigan and Sullivan start expressing suspicions to their superiors of an inside man that's leaking information. This sends both of the protagonists into paranoia overdrive, contributing greatly to the tension in scenes where they are behind enemy lines. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal of Costigan, whose skill at leading a double life comes from growing up in two very different parts of Boston, is wrought with anxiety and panic attacks induced by the risks he's forced to take on behalf of Queenan and Dignam who are at the head of the undercover operations. This Oscar-worthy performance by DiCaprio becomes the core of the film's anxious pacing and serves as a brilliant constrast to the charismatic charm and shameless ambition of Matt Damon's Sullivan. Jack Nicholson's turn as the completely amoral Costello provides an abundance of genuine laughs and ominous chills and would likely steal the scene every time were it not for the enormous talent working along with him. The plot, in true Shakespearean form, begins to spiral out of control after the climax, which becomes the first of many \\"did that just happen?\\" moments. Once things start to unravel, the ending becomes anyone's guess and a fantastic breath of fresh air in an era overwhelmed with predicatable and unnecessary twist endings. Audiences everywhere are bound to leave theatres completely exasperated and thrilled by what they've just seen and should they go back for a second viewing will come out just as satisfied as the first time around. The Departed is a film that succeeds on every level, ranking among Scorsese's best work and, like those other works, will undoubtedly be revered by many as a classic of the crime genre for both embracing the genre's traditions and boldly defying its storytelling conventions.a fantastic breath of fresh air in an era overwhelmed with predicatable and unnecessary twist endings.

B00008DDXC|4.0|This second installment on the Harry Potter series goes along the same lines as the original (althought it's a bit darker), but with more violent and adult content that is not necesarily recommended for children.  However, it's still a great movie, and I hope that the rest of films to come keep improving the saga.
B000GTLQXU|3.0|\\"The Poseidon Adventure\\" is one of my favourite movies of the 1970's. I remember seeing it as a teenager several times in Sydney at the Plaza on George Street (alas no longer). Although this remake has some awesome special FX's it really lacks heart and dramatic tension between the characters that was the essence to the original. Although I was on the edge of my seat throughout the film, I didn't care much for the characters and their plight. The original had humour and heart, this has a lot a incredible effects and that's all. I was looking forward to seeing this version and was not dissappointed, but it pales by comparison to the original version.

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|\\"The Black Parade\\" is dramatic, over the top, sensationalized and that's what makes it great. This is a Rock album with personality. Not only does it go to the edge, it jumps off and never looks back. Three cheers for My Chemical Romance for successfully romanticizing such a macabre subject and giving it life. Oh, the irony. I agree, not many people could have pulled this off with such swagger and enthusiasm. After the success of Green Day's Rock Opera, you knew there would be another. But I would have never expected a band to pull it off with such finesse. Correct, the theme is not that accessible. But there inlies the challenge. They didn't play it safe. Not that everyone has to dive into the deep end. But I have to admit, it's refreshing when it happens every once in awhile. Pushing the limit or comfort zone is good sometimes. It makes the listener dig a little deeper. If someone out there isn't stretching the boundaries, then things get stale and stay the same. So I'm glad they took some risks with this. Excellent job.
B000002I27|4.0|This took some time to grow on me, but now that it has, it's become one of my favorite Doors albums - in fact, it's only second to the debut. As you'd expect, there are several dark yet catchy pop-rockers: You're Lost Little Girl, Unhappy Girl, the cabaret-influenced People Are Strange, the psychedelic Moonlight Drive, the paranoid, creepy title track, I Can't See Your Face in My Mind - and they all range from good to excellent. In fact, People are Strange is my favorite song on the album, and one of my Top 10 Doors songs. But this ain't no normal pop album: Love Me Two Times is a damn authentic (and damn catchy) blues with a harpsichord solo and Jim screaming like a maniac; the lengthy poetry thing When the Music's Over admittedly isn't as good as The End, but it does have a nonstop, organ-driven groove, an entertainingly primitive fuzz-guitar solo, and interesting lyrics (delivered in a full-throated scream) that keep it going for ten-plus minutes.<br /><br />Some issues set in, though. I don't like the poetry reading Horse Latitudes at all, but at least it's short. My Eyes Have Seen You is pure filler, but it's not bad. And with a couple exceptions, I don't find the lyrics here to be quite as interesting as on album #1.<br /><br />Still, this is one of the Doors' best. Recommended to those who can't get enough of the first.
B000GY729M|5.0|Never have the critics been more backwards and more wrong about an album than \\"Sam's Town.\\" You would think they were a bunch of adolescents throwing fits because The Killers didn't serve up three different versions of Mr. Brightside. Well, boohoo. There's nothing wrong with this album. The music this time is more polished and more atmospheric. I think the perfect example is their second single \\"Bones.\\" Tim Burton did a fantastic video. \\"Sam's Town\\" might be one of the most underrated albums this year. But as years pass and as more albums pass, I think people will come around and view this record more highly. This album really should be selling more and there should be more hype. But radio hasn't been kind and neither have the critics. The music industry is in a downward spiral, but they only have themselves to blame when they continue to backstab great artist like The Killers and trash records like \\"Sam's Town.\\" You can't celebrate mediocrity and then wonder where all the buyers have gone.
B000007S5B|3.0|This is a fascinating album in that it contains some of the Doors' most bizarre tracks on the same album as a few of their most banal pop ones. The weird, whacky experimental songs all rule but one, and with a single exception, the banal songs are boring.<br />First, the single exception to the \\"banal pop song\\" rule. Hello, I Love You is sheer, moronic bubblegum, but I don't care - I love every minute of it, even if the riff was stolen from the Kinks. It's a lot like Love Her Madly: Pure, unadultered, unpretentious rock. And if you can't appreciate it for what it is, I'd recommend clinical help. But the question stands: how many times outside of one are you gonna listen to Love Street, Summer's Almost Gone, Wintertime Love, We Could Be So Good Together or Yes, The River Knows?<br />Then we get to the weird stuff - which, with one odious, glaring exception, is amazing. Not To Touch The Earth is simply demented - and the Celebration of the Lizard (which it's a small part of) is even more so, but I love it. Manzarek's organ sounds like it walked out of a funeral parlour from Hell, and I've got no clue what Jim's talking about but it sure is disturbing. Slightly more accessible is the politicized rant Five to One (or at least it looks political - I've heard that it means nothing because Jim was drunk off his keister when he wrote it), which is pure metal - and probably my favorite song off the album. And speaking of political protests, they pull a hell of an antiwar classic with The Unknown Soldier, which actually works in a real firing squad that, according to legend, shot at Jim in the studio. Cool! The last of my favorites is Spanish Caravan, which I think is one of the Doors' more unjustly unknown efforts. It certainly sounds like nothing else - contrast the two parts (yes, two parts in a three minute song!) and you'll see what I mean. The lone experiment I can't really get into is My Wild Love. What's the chant doing there? I don't know, but it's gotta go. Because that's one awful song.<br />This is a painfully obvious transition album (with Jim loaded during half the recording sessions - figures), but I think that this could've been something had they managed to get the full Celebration of the Lizard on tape and expanded on the experimental material - while keeping Hello, I Love You, just for contrast's sake. Now it's just an average album.ne awful song.

B00006AW2L|4.0|This might be the best of the Stones' early, pre-Beggars Banquet albums. Between the Buttons is about as good (and even loopier), and Hit Makers is easily their best blues album. But this is Brian Jones' album, as he plays more weird instruments here than he ever had before.<br />One thing you may notice about Aftermath is its lack of a Satisfaction-esque rocker. Under My Thumb has the fuzz bass and nasty lyrics, but its main hook is played by marimbas. Stupid Girl has all the swagger and sexism of a thousand Stones classics, but it's more of an organ-driven pop song than a rocker. And while Paint It, Black has the driving rhythm, that rhythm is based on an Indian (as in \\"from India\\", not \\"Native American\\") dance rhythm and contains no guitar, but sitar instead. And guess who plays the marimbas and sitar? Brian Jones. He also plays tamboura, dulcimer, sax, harmonica, organ (though not on Stupid Girl), and guitar - with both a pick and a slide. All kinds of fun stuff. I don't know where Brian learned to play all those instruments, but he was incredibly talented.<br />Now for best songs. With one big, glaring, odious exception, I like all of 'em. The chart-topper Paint It Black has always been one of my Stones favorites. I've pretty much loved it since I first heard it. Same with Under My Thumb. Lady Jane isn't as well known, but I love it - a wonderful little English Folke ditty, even folkier than Traffic's John Barleycorn days. Stupid Girl is immature, but I don't care, I like the organ part, even if it ain't Like a Rolling Stone (which may or may not have been an inspiration, I see a link between the two songs but I'm not sure if it was intended). I think several of these songs are quite underrated too: the demented country-folk Flight 505 (with Brian Jones on sax), the sullen Doncha Bother Me, the somber I Am Waiting, the bluesy It's Not Easy, and the country-folk-whatever High and Dry.<br />One song I don't like, though, is Goin' Home, a repetitive Chicago Blues jam stretched out for ten minutes. I can really get into some long songs, but this isn't one of them. Most its length is taken up by Jagger either a) repeating himself or b) seeing how many syllables he can stretch certain words out to, while the band goes through the standard blues changes in the background. I know the song has its fans, but give me You Can't Always Get What You Want, Midnight Rambler (especially the live version), Sympathy for the Devil or about half of Sticky Fingers over this anyday. Those are classic long pieces, this is just stupid and pointless.<br />However, I really like Aftermath, highly recommended Stones fans looking for something different.d out for ten minutes.

0618680004|4.0|I enjoyed parts of it very much - and the humour made me laugh out loud a couple of times. Dawkins notes that his colleagues often ask him why he throws his toys out of the pram so much. Perhaps its just his passion or maybe its become a pavlovian response to have to deal with so many sanctimonious defenders of things that don't exist. Sometimes he certainly takes the opportunity to jab back at those who have criticised him. That anger seems to come through in his writing. I don't need to be convinced so for me I was looking to be entertained. <br /> <br />Something that annoyed me was his description of Pascal as cowardly. He wasnt he just lived 400 years ago <br /> <br />I disagree with Pascals view on religion. I like him anyway for taking a stab at the question in age when the absence of information meant that perhaps superstition and irrational belief had some reasons to exist. You need to judge history by the era in which people live not todays standards. <br /> <br />I think Dawkins blusters a bit  on the evolutionary reasons for religions success. The fact is religions have survived and prospered and grown and generally Atheism has not. I don't like that fact either but it is true. His discussion around this area is pretty scathing and I would like to have seen a more scientific approach. There are good reasons why a value based, community based, networked, structured lifestyle that encourages people to breed for the community, and has significant political influence (or control) is more survivable. Its a reason why many people are in a religion and often it has nothing to do with whether there is a God or not. <br /> <br />I would say take the first quarter and the last quarter and this is a truly great book.
B00005JPAJ|5.0|In general, omnibus movies which carry divergent storylines and multiple character arcs are risky propositions for the contrivances that occur in bringing the movie back to a more holistic experience. From my perspective, Paul Haggis' \\"Crash\\" is a prime example of this hit-and-miss approach. Filmmaker Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu, however, has provided quite an exception to the rule with this spellbinder of a film tied together by our often desperate need and frequent failure to communicate. It's by turns audacious, challenging and heartbreaking, as he and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga present a puzzle-piece yet clear-eyed narrative that tenuously links complete strangers in three different locales around the world.<br /><br />It opens in a desolate area of Morocco where a goat-herding family comes in the possession of a rifle which the father instructs his two pre-adolescent sons to use on jackals who threaten the goats. Through typical sibling rivalry, one of the brothers shoots at a tourist bus and accidentally hits a female American tourist named Susan. Fears of terrorism run rampant as her husband Richard frantically tries to find medical help for her in an isolated village. Back in the U.S., Richard and Susan's nanny Amelia needs to go to her son's wedding in Mexico, but she has no one who can take care of their two young children. With her hot-headed nephew Santiago driving, Amelia decides to bring the children with her across the border. Meanwhile, there is an angry young girl in Tokyo named Chieko, deaf and mute, who is desperate for intimacy in light of an emotionally distant father and deceased mother.<br /><br />The stories gradually interlock in a non-linear manner that plays havoc with our sensibilities but not at the expense of the visceral punch that I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu and Arriaga provide with each new revelation. It's simply startling how they are able to avert the potential contrivance of the running theme through the creative dexterity of the storytelling. It also helps that the acting is so uniformly strong in light of the various languages spoken and the cultural and socioeconomic differences presented. None get a huge amount of screen time, but they make lasting impressions. Cate Blanchett and especially Brad Pitt play Susan and Richard with economic skill and palpable desperation. As the young Moroccan brothers, Said Tarchani and Boubker Ait El Caid are particularly affecting, as is Mohamed Akhzam as the sympathetic guide Anwar.<br /><br />While Gael Garcia Bernal uses his natural charisma effectively as Santiago, it is the quietly devastating work of Adriana Barraza as Amelia that makes the worst-nightmare dimensions of their story feel so authentically heartbreaking. Nevertheless, the most surprisingly powerful work comes from Rinko Kikuchi as Chieko. Although her character initially appears to be a maladjusted J-Pop-obsessed teen, Kikuchi brings out all of Chieko's inner torment and vulnerability with fluidity. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is superb considering the variety of locales he had to shoot and still stay in tune with a uniform visual look, and Gustavo Santaolalla contributes another exceptional music score. Both did similarly accomplished work on Ang Lee's \\"Brokeback Mountain\\". This is first-class work full of cathartic moments and complex emotions.

0297851527|4.0|I initially picked this book up because the cover looked intriguing and the dust flap synopsis peaked my interest.  I'm glad I did -- I got wrapped up in the story within three pages, and dropped everything else I was doing 'til I finished it.  Flynn is a writer of considerable gifts, particularly in the areas of descriptive details and spot-on dialogue.  The character Camille Preaker fascinated me, as did her relationships with her editor/surrogate father Frank Curry and birth mother Adora Crellin.  It's been a while since a character creeped me out as much as Adora.  And watch out for baby sister Amma!  She, too, is a piece of work!  Camille is brutally honest throughout the book's entire narration, and her personal story is absolutely gutwrenching.  As a reader, I came to dread having to hang around Wind Gap and its residents as much as she did.  Thomas Wolfe said, \\"You can't go home again,\\" and in the case of gutsy, damaged reporter Camille Preaker, who the hell WANTS to?!

0151003084|5.0|Go through the alphabet with Edward Gorey -- one death at a time! This is a great gift for anyone you might know with a dark sense of humor. Or as a gift to a young child whose parents you don't particularly like... This short story is, like all of Gorey, a wonderfully illustrated and twisted look at the world from a very different perspective. If you already like, or have an interest in Edward Gorey, I would recommend you skip this and just purchase Amphigorey which contains this story as well as many others.
B00005JPBD|5.0|This movie is everything an Almodovar film is always hyped up to be, but unlike his last film, this one is great. I had literally been counting down the days to watch this film and it is by far my 2nd favorite of his (1st one is Talk to Her). I was disappointed with Bad Education, but he nailed every single detail in this film (you'll definitely see what I mean, especially if you're Latino).
0743539478|4.0|As always Dan Brown writes lively characters and a quick paced story showcased against a vivid, informative background. Add a few plot twists and you have a story that reads like a movie thriller. If you've read Dan Brown before and liked him, you'll see his usual storyline unfold and enjoy this book.

B000059HB7|5.0|Rio Bravo and El Dorado both star John Wayne and were produced by Howard Hawks.  The story lines are very similar but Rio Bravo has a stronger supporting cast.  Walter Brennan is excellent as \\"Stumpy\\" and Angie Dickinson is far more appealing as the female love interest.  Ricky Nelson gave a credible performance considering this was one of his first movie roles.  If you must choose between the two movies, this is the one you will enjoy the most.
B00005ATQH|5.0|<br /> <br />Lolita, based on the controversial novel by Vladimir Nabokov, who wrote the screenplay for Stanley Kubrick, but Kubrick disregarded it (I read this on Wikipedia). Having read the novel as an assignment in College, I thought this movie was going to be as obscene as the novel (without downplaying the book, I mean only the lustful utterances by the character Humbert Humbert). <br /> <br />Kubrick cleverly builds up the sexual tension between Humbert Humbert and Lolita, while Charlotte Haze blinded by her mature age and her need for finding a man for herself, does not pay attention to the evident lust of  Humbert Humbert for her daughter, and the flirtings of her precocious child. <br /> <br />There is a big lesson in this movie and one that Humbert Humbert fails to pay attention to: 'The universe does not revolve around you.' And when he realizes of it, Lolita has already fled away after having held a secret affair with Quilty (Peter Sellers), who turns out to be a stalking, deceiving man, a person much more dangerous than Humbert Humbert himself, the one we thought as the sexual predator, but who, at the end of the story is revealed to be just a pathetic sick man. <br /> <br />What could have been a very nasty movie, and surely cut, or even prohibited by censors (the sexual situations are just insinuated), is instead a drama seasoned with comical overtones, like when in the motel, Humbert Humbert and the valet are trying to deploy the collapsible bed, while Lolita sleeps.  <br /> <br />As a sidenote, I wish that Stanley Kubrick and Peter Sellers could have worked together in more projects, Peter Sellers is great in both Lolita & Dr. Strangelove; surely Peters Sellers has been of the best actors in the history of cinematography. <br /> <br />While in the novel, Vladimir Nabokov kills all the 'sinners' in his story (Lolita dies during childbirth), here in Kubrick's Lolita, she survives.  <br /> <br />Do not be scared away by the classification of this movie as an Art Movie or Cult Classic, Stanley Kubrick didn't shoot his movies for an elite of intellectuals, but for all of us who enjoy a good story.
0887307280|4.0|This was an excellent book, I enjoyed the book from cover to cover.  The information and story within kept me attached to the book.  I don't own a business, but hopefully soon I will.  You better believe I will follow the steps I learned from this book.
B000G8NXZK|3.0|I saw Brazil again after many years, and I don't think it has worn too well over time.  While still interesting and a bit provocative, it seems a little tame now.  Also, the 3 disc treatment given it by Criterion results in one disc filled with Brazil-related documentaries that are basically quite boring, and one disc contains the 90-minutes version that Gilliam, with good reason, refused to release.  If you are interested in purchasing Brazil, buy the single disc edition and leave it at that.  I'm glad I only rented this one.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|I watched the Blu-ray version of this movie and it looked great visually, but the movie lacked substance.      First off, Brett Ratner's vision of Xmen 3 was so terrible that it equates to Joel Schumacher's vision of Batman & Robin. Yes, Xmen 3 is the Batman & Robin of the Xmen Universe.     Xmen 3 was not very good. Yes there is a lot of action, but it's pointless and without a cohesive story. The movie had 13 different plots going on at the same time and none of the plots actually came together, and if two or three did, they were done terribly. The dialogue was bad.     If you know anything about Xmen, you cannot bring the entire series to a close in 1 and half hours. The first two movies in the series spent so much time developing the characters and story. Xmen 2 was done really well, combining story and action successfully. Brett Ratner's Xmen 3 was all action and no substance.     The characters who were strongly developed in the previous two movies didn't exist for long in the third movie (Cyclops and Rogue). The third part should have been split into TWO different 2 hour long movies if they wanted to end the series.     And now for my personal view: Stupid, terrible new characters were introduced. The casting wasn't that great for the new characters. It is possible to make a great Marvel/super hero movie while staying true to the ORIGINAL material that made it so famous in the firstplace. See Ironman. See Dark Knight.  Keep it serious as the source material is of a serious nature.    Xmen 3 as a movie is a far cry from the original source material, didn't mind the leather suits at all, but the stories seemed like a young high school student wrote it.  Next time make a more serious Xmen movie along the lines of the first two Xmen movies.
6305907145|4.0|Entertaining. Actually, it wasn't actually as exciting as I expected from seeing its' DVD trailer. The change of the story, although not major, did not suit my feeling. Characters for Henry Crawford, Mary Crawford, Edmund, and Fanny well chosen. Actually, Fanny's characters were not exactly as same as described in the book, but I like her better in the movie.
B000FTWB7G|2.0|I really loved 'Fallen', but this CD was a bit of a disappointment.  The song writing was not as good as Fallen.  I think it was nice to hear the orchestral instruments fused into the music, but the major thing I noted was that Amy Lee was dropping her voice lower than it was capable of going and it sounded horrible.  On several occasions, she even attempted the range of an opera singer soprano and that did not sound too good either.  The first album was flawless and Amy's vocals were right on target, but the fact that she pushed her vocal ability either higher or lower then what she is capable of ruined the album (for me anyway).

B000GBEWHA|1.0|I am really shocked at all the positive reviews that this worthless piece of crap is getting. The leather jacket slipcase is awesome, the new special features are great, but nevertheless I am reselling my copy (having only seen it once) because I cannot stand this new, remastered soundtrack.  <br /> <br />This seems to be a new trend with some studios, where they make a new soundtrack that makes the film completely unwatchable. If I have to stay with VHS or Laserdisc to have Grease with its original soundtrack, then so be it. But I will be damned if I sit through an American cinematic classic listening to this awful, echoey, added sound garbage Paramount wants to call \\"remastered\\". <br /> <br />Shame on everyone involved with the release of this DVD. At the very least, they could have offered the *option* of the ORIGINAL soundtrack. <br /> <br />The movie rates 5 stars, the special features rate a good strong 4. The soundtrack ruins this release and therefore this particular edition is rated a 1.

1592401791|1.0|You will first encounter one of the biggest lines of BS when you read Elvis Costello's foreword where he describes Mr. Emerick at the end of the second paragraph: \\"You could not meet a more modest and self-effacing man\\". If Geoff Emerick truly has such qualities you'll be hard pressed to find it in this book because the journeyman hack he hired in writing this piece of rubbish does too well of a job in presenting him as completely the opposite. Other reviewers have mentioned the constant fawning over Paul McCartney at every opportunity, the absurd trashing of George Harrison and Ringo Starr at every other opportunity, and the insensitive denouncing of John Lennon in between those opportunities. The put-downs he throws towards George Martin are just childish. This is such an annoying book that halfway through, this long-time Beatles aficionado who was greatly looking forward to reading it had to stop. To paraphrase George Harrison, \\"it's a drag, a well-known drag...\\"
0805066691|5.0|\\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" picks up where \\"The Trail of Tears\\" by Gloria Jahoda ends, for a continued look into a history where the home of the Brave was taken as the land for free after Columbus \\"discovered\\" the already inhabited land and named her America.<br /><br />Dee Brown has done a brilliant job compiling and writing \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee:  An Indian History of The American West\\" almost as if this book were a first-eye report during the 1860-1890 era, a time when the growing crowd of white settlers moved westward in search of more land and after the eastern Native American tribes had already been systematically removed from the east toward the west.  The work includes photographs of chiefs and people of prominence within each respective chapter of time.  At the back of the book, there is an index for reference.  The beginning of each chapter is prefaced with a time-line of other world events for perspective as well as the obviously well-thought-out quotes of important Native American Indians.  Legendary Native American Indian tribes, chiefs and warriors included in this book are:  Navaho, Modoc, the many branches of Dakota (Sioux), Nez Perces, Apache, Ute, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Crow, Comanche, Ponca, Sitting Bull, Geronimo, Ouray, Crazy Horse, Chief Joseph, Captain Jack, Cochise, Manuelito, Little Crow, Roman Nose, Dull Knife, Little Wolf and many others.<br /><br />The Long Walk of the Navajo - a people once very rich but left destitute and dying on a parceled out prison-land reservation of unimaginable, horrid conditions - is a familiar walk of the fates of other Nation tribes before and after themselves.  Although different in their own ways, each tribe's fate was related in their suffering the same resounding theme of systematic destruction due to the greed of the white settlers.<br /><br />Anything not of the white way was considered barbaric. Instead of assimilating into their host country, the white people bullied and deceived Indians into meek submission to adopt their way and live on unwanted reservation lands or face death.  When America had an interest in Indian land, they found ways, generally by brute force, to remove the Indians from their land. Unprovoked attacks, false arrests and killing and rounding-up survivors to take them to a worthless piece of land so settlers could stake land claims were part of the tactics used when the west was lost to white invaders. If land was not handed over promptly, entire villages were massacred, burned and destroyed, the survivors taken and labeled prisoners of war.  Tribes of gentle, non-resistant Indians were conquered and exterminated.  Cries of \\"Exterminate or banish!\\" were common among the settlers as was the seizure of land without pretense of payment.  Gold seekers and settlers encroaching on land constantly provoked and stole from the Indians and then reversed the truth. The building of forts and the Union Pacific Railroad system in the middle of their hunting grounds and scaring the buffalo also heavily infringed upon terms of the treaties.  Places that were sacred and holy to the Indian people, were mined by gold-crazed whites and trespassed upon although words of the treaties specifically said that no white man could pass over, settle upon or reside in the territory set forth.  Those who fought too hard to keep their land or freedom were automatically marked for extinction.  Any white who defended the rights of the Indian people were ridiculed, ostracized and worse.<br /><br />Even if attacked first, the Indians were considered murderers in their defense, yet for the whites, a killing was considered an \\"act of war\\" and punishment was never administered.  The soldiers routinely \\"acted with crazy minds,\\" brutally massacring indiscriminately, sometimes leaving 2/3 of the dead as mutilated women and children.  The Indian people only fought trespassing soldiers who were on their land and did so with brilliant war strategies.  There were never fair trials because it was the white man's law and under that law Indians were \\"not persons within the meaning of the law.\\"  They were considered aliens at birth.<br /><br />\\"Let us own the country together,\\" proposed Buffalo Chief, who along with all Native Americans, desperately wanted peace and tried at all costs to find it. \\"Peace\\" almost always meant life on a reservation of the white man's choosing, never being able to leave the military, political operations without written permission.  A promise of peace in the government's treaty would always say the Indians would no more be relocated yet they would continue to be relocated, sometimes four and five times.  The \\"People of the horse,\\"  accustomed to traveling where they pleased in the land \\"where everything drew a free breath,\\" were constantly sent to poor and barren \\"Indian territories\\" or reservations where the people became very sick or died while imprisoned.  Tribes had to share the reservations with other tribes not to their liking and were punished severely if they left.  Promises of annuities and peace in exchange for their land were continually broken and to the reservations was funneled bad food and sub-standard supplies  at best.  Still, the Indians were not allowed to travel in order to hunt their own food as they once did.  The buffalo were nearly extinct due to the sport hunting of the whites who left them to rot.  General Sheridan was one of many who condoned the hunting/extermination \\"to allow civilization to advance.\\"  Between 1872 - 1874, 3,700,000 buffalo were destroyed.  Of those, only 150,000 were taken by the Native Americans who utilized every part of the buffalo for survival.<br /><br />Long-time Indian adversary, George Crook, who was experienced in the dealings of treachery, later concluded, \\"It is too often the case that border newspapers...disseminate all sorts of exaggerations and falsehoods about the Indians, which are copied in papers of high character and wide circulation, in other parts of the country, while the Indians' side of the case is rarely ever heard.  In this way, the people at large get false ideas with reference to the matter.  Then when the outbreak does come, public attention is turned to the Indians, their crimes and atrocities are alone condemned, while the persons whose injustice has driven them to this course, escape scot-free and are the loudest in the denunciations.  No one knows this fact better than the Indian, therefore he is excusable in seeing no justice in a government which only punishes him, while it allows the white man to plunder him as he pleases.\\"  Or as Yellow Wolf explained it, the unjust whites told \\"only his own best deeds, only the worst deeds of the Indians.\\"<br /><br />In death, the Indian people were also dishonored with no proper burial given.  Captain Jack's (Kintpuash) body, for instance, was taken away after his hanging, to be embalmed,  appearing in eastern cities as a carnival attraction.<br /><br />Even if the rightful Native American land owners had ceded their land under proper and understandable terms instead of under dubious means and sometimes faulty translations, it can be said that they were never given full disclosure as to the havoc and destruction that was to follow as the result from the change of hands in the ownership and more importantly to them, the stewardship of that land.  Also logical is the fact that the Native Americans would not have willingly moved from their beloved ancestral homes so connected to their own lives to a foreign imprisonment unless threatened, coerced or tricked.<br /><br />History may have turned out quite differently had the Native American Indians consolidated forces and known their foreign adversary better.  Instead of fighting against warriors in the manner they were accustomed to however, their enemy first appeared in disguise as a friend who took the extended hand offered in friendship and then chopped it off after the treaties were signed.<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee\\" as an important, must-read for every American, especially those interested in a fuller disclosure of the truth as well as a case study into the manifestation of human greed, acceptable crimes possible through mob mentality, dehumanization,  intolerance, misunderstanding and other hideous examples of depravity.

0321344758|5.0|The book, like the advice found within, is lean and mean -- no bloat. <br />The title is true to it's name.  Very fast read because it is intelligent and concise.  Mr. Krug keeps it short and sweet and still packs the pages with very good tips for web design.  The illustrations are fantastic and really help make the point.
1400034779|5.0|I found this book in my search for a new mystery series to devour.  Although I had some reservations about the book in general (it was clearly not a Lisa Scottoline, Jeffrey Deaver, John Sanford type novel), I decided to give it a try.  Wow--it was so much better than I expected.  Is it a mystery book?  Yes. . . well, sort of.  It has some of the elements of a mystery, but is far from a thriller.  This book is a window into the human spirit.  The book is interesting, and masterfully written.  If you are searching for a fast-paced action thriller, this is not the book for you.  If you are open to a leisurely stroll into a new world, this book is one of the best I have read.
B000G75AE8|5.0|Oh yes! Slayer is back and this album is one of ther best. I Love older albums such as Hell Awaits and Reign In Blood and slayer will probably never match the sounds or intensity of those albums..But moving forward to Christ Illusion..this album is an awesome Slayer album. I have has issues with a few of the past albums such as Diablous in Musica and God hates us all but for the most part they were good albums....not Slayer good but good in their own right. This one reverses the trend I saw of them fading into oblivion with mediocre songs. In a nutshell..buy this record, cd, or whatever..if you havent listend to Slayer in a while..this one is worth it!

A classic if there ever was one for western pasta lovers.
080701429X|5.0|\\"Man can endure any how as long as he has a why ...\\"  To me, this is the essential take-away of this clear, moving essay by concentration camp survivor Viktor Frankl.  He recounts how those who survived the ordeal were often those who could find an aim and purpose outside themselves to keep on going.  Man chooses his own attitude toward adversity and, in so doing, transcends life's inevitable suffering.   <br /> <br />A great book which merits re-reading periodically again and again...
B000ATQYT2|5.0|\\"A Muppet Christmas Carol\\" was the first Muppet film to be made after Jim Henson's death, directed by his son Brian Henson and based more or less on the Charles Dicken's novel. I'm a fan of both the muppets, and of Dicken's story, so it was a good combination.    Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine in this version) is a little more crotchety than usual in this film. He is not just in charge of a successful business, but he's in charge of the mortgages of the London townsfolk. He commands a roomful of rats as bookeepers, as well as the mild mannered Bob Cratchitt (Kermit the Frog). The night before Christmas, the ghosts of Jacob and Robert Marley (the Hecklers) come to visit Scrooge to change his ways, along with three ghosts. Charles Dickens (Gonzo) and Rizzo the Rat also visit. Though they're the narrators and know what's going to happen, they want to see it for themselves, and get in more than a bit of trouble for it.    Michael Caine did a really good job as Scrooge, I thought. His Scrooge was a cold man, but more because this Scrooge didn't know any better than deliberately, if that makes sense. I also like the way his character gradually and steadily mellows through the story, you can see it in his face. It was nice to see all the muppets bopping around again, though I wish some of my favorite characters had a bit more time on screen. Ah well. The ghosts of Christmas were great. I always love to see the really big muppets ambling around in these films. There's quite a few songs sung during the story, which I'm not the biggest fan of, but they fit in with the film pretty well.    Special features include an audio commentary from Brian Henson, a \\"Christmas Around the World\\" skit with Gonzo and Rizzo, a gag reel (which is actually pretty funny) and a making of documentary.    Definitely worth a look for Muppet and Christmas Carol fans.

B000F5GO0A|5.0|This and M Ward's Postwar are my favorite cd's of 2006. It's brilliant how this band is able to make Eastern European/Russian traditional type music accessible. I know that this may be a weird comparison but this type of music innovation to me is like Moby's Play album (really old gospel songs to contemporary beats) and Enigma's MCMXC A.D. (Gregorian Chants to dance beats)--not the type of combinations you would expect.

630588255X|5.0|After watching this movie one Friday night I immediately watched it again. \\"Did I just see that\\" was my initial reaction. A fantastic film that sticks with you for weeks. Initially rented from a local blockbuster before purchasing it via Amazon, I watched it over 6 times before returning it back. I loved the Cat Stevens soundtrack and it makes me sad that there is no Harold and Maude soundtrack that has all of the songs especially \\" Tea for the Tillerman\\". You appreciate the brilliant directing and although it has been considered \\"creepy\\" it is never truly unsettling, but rather it makes you examine how you add value to life and for myself created ways to be Maude-a-licous!

1400049628|5.0|Max Brooks gives us the Zombie Survival Guide, written in a viewpoint of seriousness. It's not laugh-out-loud funny but is quite humorous in its seriousness. Brooks does a fine job of covering the bases. We get the finer basic points of survival in a zombie outbreak. Chapters cover zombie origins, alongside the Stages or levels of contagion of a zombie epidemic (Stages 1 thru 4, with Stage 4 being zombie overrun world). You learn what to do when running away from zombies, including what types of terrain to use and avoid, what equipment you'll need, transportation, what to avoid, and where to go. Next is your basic arsenal advisory on what to use and what to avoid given a rundown on pros/cons of a variety of weapons. Next is your defense vs a zombie force whether it's a secluded fortress or house setup beforehand or if where to hole up while on the run. Be sure to avoid police & fire stations, shopping malls, grocery stores, and hospitals. Second storey house are better if you go upstairs and destroy the staircase even prisons are preferred for a good solid base of operations. Following this is the offense groups can take once a base has been setup. Rounding it out is where to go and what to do when the Stage 4 zombies-takeover-world happens. Concluding the book is the history of zombie infestation and outbreaks. These are great and well thought out and some great short stories could be written off these 'occurances'. After reading this, you'll end up picking up Brooks other book \\"[[ASIN:B000JMKQX0 World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War]]\\".<br /><br />Overall, entertaining and Brooks provides us with a great 'survival guide'. Be prepared, be alert, be safe.

B000G7599Y|5.0|Karl Bohm (1894-1981) is considered by many to be among the best Mozart conductors of the 2nd half of the 20th century, along with Otto Klemperer, Sir Thomas Beecham, Bruno Walter, and George Szell.  Bohm uses the Berlin Philharmonic here: a large orchestra - in Mozart, yet the sound is always lean when needed and textures are always clear. The Berlin Philharmonic sounds better here under Bohm's direction: more precise, rich, and full, than under many other conductors, including their own Herbert von Karajan (dir. 1955-1989) in his 1970s ADD and 1980s DDD Mozart Symphony recordings for DG.<br /><br />These are my favorite recordings of Mozart's Symphonies.  The earlier symphonies are given a dignity and grace which often slips by in newer recordings.  If Symphony 33 and 39 aren't as good as some - there is some scrappy playing in 39: III and IV, overall the level of playing and style is very high.  I supplement this set with other Mozart Symphony recordings of Klemperer/Philharmonia (EMI),  Bohm/Vienna Philharmonic (DG - late 1970s), Beecham/Royal Philharmonic (BBC Classics, EMI, Sony UK), Walter/Columbia Symphony (CBS) and New York Philharmonic (Sony \\"Bruno Walter Edition\\" - good mono mid-1950s sound), and Szell/Cleveland (Sony: Numbers 28, 33, 35;  and on another disc: 35, 40, 41).<br /><br />Recording dates are from 1960-1968, and are warm analog, ADD Stereo sound.<br /><br />The earlier symphonies were recorded in 1968, the last 3 Symphonies about 1962.  Sound is very consistent from disc to disc.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!

B000GY729M|3.0|The Killers music is fun and full of energy, but all their songs sound the same.  If you like their sound, then you'll like their albums, but if you crave variety then this might not be for you.  They don't venture into unchartered waters but they tread well where they cast anchor.<br /><br />There are a couple more \\"brightsides\\" to this album as compared to their last, those being \\"When You Were Young,\\" \\"For Reasons Unkown,\\" \\"Read My Mind,\\" \\"Bones,\\" and \\"The River is Wild.\\"<br /><br />The set up of this album leaves one to believe that it might be somewhat of a concept album with it's \\"Enterlude\\" and \\"Exitude\\" and with a title like Sam's Town, but it's really nothing of the sort.<br /><br />Makes for good background music.
B000002KP3|5.0|I feel very privileged to have gotten this album for Christmas from my Mother. She had asked the guy at the record store what to get a young teenage boy. Thanks to that clerk, I listened to this album for almost a full year before it hit big in America. I wore the vinyl out listening to these songs with great hooks and mysterical lyrics. My older brothers friends would make fun of me as I listened to Electric Warrior in my room.Boy, were they wrong!  Today, the songs on this album really hold up. To think that \\"Get it On\\" had to be renamed as \\"Bang a Gong\\" because it was too racy for the USA is mind-boggling. I think \\"Mambo Sun\\" could have been a big hit, and \\"Jeepster\\" is a good song.\\"Motivator\\" is bouncy and \\"Planet Queen\\" has a cool cosmic feel to it.I think the US wasn't ready for the kind of lyrics Marc Bolan wrote. They were ahead of their time. Whenever I hear \\"Bang a Gong\\" on the the radio, I think of my Mother, and how cool it was to get an unknown album(at the time) that had one of the greatest songs on it(Bang a Gong)that also became one of my favorite albums of all-time! And how cool is that album cover?!

B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This is a sure win. One recommendation. BUY THIS CD! Gerard Way is an outstanding vocalist and the band is ridiculously talented.  <br />And for all those haters out there: Some are upset they are getting a whole lot of success, b/c now they are commerical...all I have to say is GOOD FOR THE BAND! The only reason they become famous is because they deserve to. If they speak to such a large audience, they must be doing something right.  <br />And for those who claim they are like Green Day...You must have never owned a Green Day cd because I have been a long term fan of Green Day and both bands have completely different sounds and messages. Music is always bound to blend...music inspires music. My Chemical Romance is much darker and their lyrics have a different poetry than Green Day.  <br />My Chemical Romance has matured from Bullets and Three Cheers. There is no comparing this to any other band. They have created a beautiful cd that contains dark lyrics and amazing songs. I am a musician myself and I have an eclectic collection of music (listening from shubert to paul wall) and My Chemical Romance is an incredible piece of art. Check out \\"Black Parade\\" \\"Mama\\" \\"Cancer\\" \\"Teenagers\\"....just some of my personal favorites from the cd that I cannot stop listening to.
B00005J79H|4.0|Scorpions \\"Acoustica\\" is a must-have for any true Scorpions fan. But if you're a first-time Scorpions listener, you probably don't want to pick this up as your first Scorpions CD.<br /><br />The CD is made up of tracks played by the band in a concert in Portugal some time ago and all of the songs are played with accoustic guitars instead of electric. The result is an awesome listening experience as the band does a good job of keeping the crowd energized throughout the entire performance. Some tracks do not come across as effectively as they do in their original recordings, but some come off exceptionally.<br /><br />The band also does a good job on the some of the covers they perform here such as \\"Drive\\" by The Cars and \\"Dust In The Wind\\" by Kansas, which, in my opinion, is the best track on this CD.<br /><br />Pick up this CD if you have additional Scorpions material in your current collection. If you are a first-time listener and are wanting to check out what the Scorpions are all about, you should check out some of their greatest hits compilations first and then come back later to check out this great disc.
B00005JPAM|5.0|The most surprising thing about this film is that it doesn't really take sides. Instead it examines the personal responses & political decisions made by Queen Elizabeth II and Prime Minister Tony Blair during the week following Lady Diana's tragic death. Though both Helen Mirren and Michael Sheen give outstanding Oscar-worthy performances the real star/hero of this film is, as you might expect, Lady Di.<br /><br />Most people already know that virtually everyone in the world adored Lady Di while she was alive and that many experienced her death almost as a personal loss; and that many people continue to view her as one of the late twentieth-century's most intriguing and personable icons. Frears certainly knows the iconic value of Lady Di and just how she was and continues to be perceived by not only the British people but the people of the world. To the people of the world she is a person who embodied glamor and grace in a way no public figure had done before or has done since, and on top of that she bravely defied the life-denying royal protocols and out-of-date traditions that were no longer responsive to the people's needs and merely put a great chasm between the royals and real life. While the rest of the royals went about their merry way blissfully out-of-touch with the way they were being perceived by the modern world and blissfully dysfunctional as human beings, Lady Di was the one person who remained in touch with her instincts and emotions and in touch with the people. And it was these displays of genuine human qualities and emotion in interview after interview that gave people something to connect with and admire. Lady Di's attempt to break free from the old royal ways represented to the English people their own desire to break free from the stultifying confines of tradition. One could say that Lady Di was a modern in a house full of ancients (who still believed it was ok for Prince Charles to have a mistress; and to hunt stags and foxes just for fun). Even though Lady Di had no real political power she had tremendous symbolic power and when she died Tony Blair, because he knew what she represented to the people, immediately appreciated how deeply her loss would be felt. Tony Blair also immediately appreciated that it was important not to try and turn Lady Di's death into an opportunity for personal political gain even though the opportunity was there. But without even trying, or simply by trying to do the decent thing and not the most advantageous thing politically Blair came across as a decent guy and a guy that acted and thought like Lady Di herself who always put people before politics.<br /><br />To the royals, however, Lady Di was just a thorn in their side and her death only aggravated an already deep wound. To them her open defiance of royal ways was an assault on English tradition and decorum and her affiliations with celebrities and playboys as well as her open criticism of Charles and the rest of the royals in the press just seemed undiginified and vulgar. To the people of course Lady Di's dalliances seemed like much deserved breaths of fresh air after years of royal confinement. Though Lady Di never espoused any political views of her own, her highly publicized struggles with the royal family forever wounded the publics image of all things royal. Still, despite these well publicized differences, the public expected the Queen to be magnanimous and to eulogize Lady Di in some public way. The British and world press certainly did not expect the Queen to be petty but that is exactly how the British and world press perceived the Queen's week-long silence that followed that fatal car crash in Paris.<br /><br />In many ways Lady Di remains the star of this picture. Every time we see another interview or any video footage of her we are in awe of how powerful her image was and remains. The Queen, on the other hand, is not loved and no one knows this more than she. But she is not portrayed here as simply the much maligned princess-nemesis that you might expect. This film takes an equivocal approach and allows us an insiders glimpse in to how the story played out in both the royal and Blair households that week in 1997 and the film also allows us to understand exactly why each person responded the way they did. By allowing us an especially close behind-the-scenes look at the inner-workings of two very distinct political minds with very different social & political backgrounds and points of view we find, to our surprise, that Tony Blair and the Queen, as far apart as they are on the political spectrum, do indeed have something in common: a respect for decency and a sense of themselves as selfless public servants; and even though they show that decency and play their roles in radically different ways both ultimately come off as essentially decent people and by films end we even feel that these two may get on rather nicely. And so the real revelation here is that the Queen mum is actually a human being who just isn't that good at relating with her subjects and Blair's the guy who is credited with providing the Queen with some much needed emotional counsel & public relations advice. What we see is a Queen that does hold an obvious grudge against Diana but we also see that she needs her subjects emotional support just as much as they need her public display of emotion. This is trying for her because she is not used to showing emotion publicly, in fact she's been trained all of her life not to show emotion and Blair is sensitive to this generational difference in attitude toward what is and is not appropriate. Its only Tony Blair himself who sees what the Queen is really like and its only Blair who can finesse the Queen into reversing her earlier miscalculation and to make a public statement in recognition of Lady Di without making her feel publicly or politically humiliated. Blair is sensitive to public opinion but he also realizes that the press and the public are not always spot-on when it comes to assessing the lives of public figures, especially their inner lives. His public sympathies are with the very popular Lady Di but privately his sympathy is, surprisingly, with the Queen.<br /><br />As the Queen, Mirren gives a touching performance, and one full of the kinds of subtleties and nuances that only the worlds greatest actresses are capable of delivering. Her skill is not just in making the Queen likable but also in allowing us to comprehend this profoundly conservative woman. Mirren gives her humor and heart, and the scene where we see the Queen suddenly and unexpectedly overcome by the grief that she actually feels is as surprising to us as it is to her.<br /><br />What's so graceful about this film is its ability to use the Lady Di tragedy as a way to heal both personal and political wounds, and to find  the higher common ground that unites people of all political persuasions. The films idealism is a worthy tribute to the legacy of Lady Di. The Queen is an easy film to like and one of the rare films that actually makes you feel good.<br /><br />The press takes a good slapping on the wrist and they deserve it but they are not the only ones villainized. The real bad guys here are the ones who pay closer attention to politics than to people and thus live in their heads instead of their hearts. In the royal household the Queen's husband, Prince Philip, comes off as not just emotionally cold but rather indifferent to the Lady Di tragedy and to human feeling in general; his own emotional life, stunted as it is, provides him with no way of comprehending the depth of public feeling that Lady Di inspires. The only emotion that he seems capable of expressing is resentment; he has no real feeling for the people, and the people none for him. He represents the royals at their worst as he lives in a cocoon of privilege completely cut-off from real world events. In comparison, Prince Charles actually comes across as well-intentioned and capable of compassion and sympathy; although he is portrayed as painfully awkward and hopelessly ineffectual as a public figure, he is also potrayed as a good father, and a caring ex-husband. Although funny and witty and in many ways very likable because always ready with a clever quip or retort Blair's key analyst/speechwriter, Alastair Campbell, does not come off much better than the Queens' husband in the final analysis as he is incapable of seeing the Lady Di tragedy as anything but a political opportunity. Though its Mirren as the Queen and Michael Sheen as Blair that will win Oscar nods (and deservedly so) this subtle portrait of a scheming progressive also deserves notice.o assessing the lives of public figures, especially their inner lives.

B00097DXZS|2.0|After leaving a huge legacy during the '60's and '70s, Carlos Santana made a gigantic, Grammy-winning comeback with his phenomenal album, \\"Supernatural\\". A big part of his success after being off the radar for years (besides his undeniable talent)was the addition of both songwriting and appearances from many current artists, assuredly a plot hatched by many music execs and focus groups. Unfortunately, they seem to be running that formula into the ground. Two post-Grammy xerox albums later, and I may have finally given up on Carlos for a while. Part of the big problem on this release is the attempt to combine Santana's singular Latin-influenced style with an overabundance of R&B and hip-hop, which just comes across sounding contrived. Your money would be much more well-spent on the recently remastered release of Santana III, which is not only excellent but comes with a bonus disc of live material that smokes.
B000GY729M|5.0|Honestly, the reason why I even checked out The Killers was because I heard they are from Vegas, and there aren't that many decent bands from my home state.  Then I saw the video for \\"Bones\\" on MTV and loved the song, went to I-tunes and sampled the rest of Sam's Town's songs, and got the cd.  It's my favorite cd since Eminem's \\"The Eminem Show\\" (yes, I have very weird musical tastes).  I grew up on 80's new wave and rock, and The Killers remind me of a time when music was about something other than  bling or how miserable the world is.  And I can actually listen to the whole cd with my 10 year old niece in the car, since there is no foul language or graphic lyrics about drugs and sex... maybe I'm getting old but it's a refreshing change.  All in all, it's fun, catchy, straight-up rock-n-roll. I'm very proud of my home-state representation in current pop music.
B000IOM0YM|5.0|<br />I've been waiting for something like this for years. Instead of having to be satisfied with the occasional snippet between interviews, which is usually the case, this is 100% vintage footage, unspoiled by the countless crowd shots and compressed sound that taints most rock DVDs these days. <br /> <br />It's brutally real and it needs no extra effects, because it's what real rock music is supposed to sound like. For people who've loved the band since the '70s, this is fascinating, jaw-dropping stuff. The reviewers who whine about how this doesn't look or sound like a modern-concert DVD are completely missing the point. We're GLAD it's left the way it was filmed. There's obviously been some sound cleaning-up and picture restoration, but since all of the sound was on just one stereo channel, the instruments couldn't be separated, so they're merely mastered for digital as best as they can be. <br /> <br />This is the real thing, without any of the usual after-the-fact overdubs. It's exactly what Kiss fans have been hoping for, for a very long time indeed. It's an intentionally low-priced collection of bootleg footage and TV appearances, and it ROCKS. <br />
B00003CWL6|1.0|One of the the most overrated film in recent times.  In years to come, if not already, people will wonder why such a fuss was made about it.  A supreme confidence trick of marketing that was so successful the audience didn't know, and some still don't know, that it was being had.
0553579908|5.0|Just finished A Clash of Kings and I'm still a George R.R. Martin fan. This book is totally worth your time, but you do have to begin with A Game of Thrones. If you've read that already you know what Martin's qualities are - strong, unique characters, complex motivations, multiple plotlines, long simmering suspense, and deadly surprises. All these things are in evidence in this volume. <br /> <br />It amazes me that Martin can unfold his story in such an unhurried manner. And it amazes me that I'm so content to go along with him as he does so. Certainly a ton of things happen in this book. Some characters meet their fates, others are challenged and challenged again and still have a long road ahead of them. But there's so much that he leaves simmering and promised - the coming attack from across the Wall, Daenerys return with her growing dragons, the slow stirrings of magic returning to the land, for example. And some of the main characters - like Rob - are essentially off-stage for the entire novel. We know what he's up to, where he's fighting and how he won, but we don't really get his story from his perspective. <br /> <br />But that's only a minor issue, because we do get wonderful stories from many other characters. I'm particularly a fan of Daenerys, and of Tyrion, who thankfully has a large role in this novel. And Jon's adventures beyond the Wall are great too. I still wish Martin gave more time and attention to documenting the largescale battles in the novel, but I felt he did more of this in this book than in A Game of Thrones. Maybe future volumes will get even better. I'm hoping, because this series has the potential to be a major favorite of mine - as it obviously already is for a great many readers. <br /> <br />It's great stuff, and after a bit of a rest I'll happily move on to the third book.

B000002I4S|5.0|I noticed that a lot of hardcore jazz folks have written extensively about the arcane virtues of this album, so I just want to chime in that I find this music to be quite fun and accessible compared to Coltrane's later work. A few reviewers have warned that it might be \\"difficult\\" to listen to--as a fairly UNsophisticated listener who knows nothing about music theory, I'd have to strongly disagree.  The album features Coltrane playing original compositions in his mature style, but the songs are catchy and concise, with very infectious hooks. It's the perfect first Coltrane record for anyone who's just getting into modern jazz and wants a representative example of his work-- comparable to Miles' \\"Kind of Blue\\" and Brubeck's \\"Time Out\\".

My wife requested this one as we walked through the New Release aisles.  I really love Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, and was glad to see them reunited once again, as lovers.  The story was a tiny bit confusing, but that is okay, and I thought the cinematography was stunning.  I watched this on a very good computer monitor, up close, and thought the picturesque scenes were still wonderful (I normally watch it on my 55 inch HD screen.)<br /><br />I wish they had better character development of some of the side characters, but I think this was the director's intention.  I enjoyed seeing that one dude from Nip Tuck.  I'd like to see him in more big movies.<br /><br />I give this a rousing 5 stars, but round up form 4.5.<br /><br />MC White said:  Very good!
B000003S5H|5.0|This is nearly a 5 star recording, so I gave it five stars because 4 stars would not have been fair.  The music is a lot like Zero Seven.  It is where I would like music to move to.  Beautiful, intellegent stuff.  Can be listened to closely, or can provide a moody and uplifting backround.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|The greatest thing about My Chemical Romance is not that they remake themselves but rather that, with each album, they continue to explore the complexities of their musical style.  In The Black Parade they have deconstructed and reconstructed their style into a complex, varied, over the top, theatrical production that at times may be too overproduced but yet still succeeds on each song.  The theme is still dark (it is about a person dying of cancer) but shows some real thought and sensitivity (not just some quick jokes and clever lines). The Album starts off with \\"The End\\", a Pink Floyd The Wall type intro, and then moves into a variety of songs, pulling riffs that at times sound like Cheap Trick, or Queen (that is if Tom Waits was part of Queen) (e.g., \\"Mama\\") and to some standard MCR fare (e.g., \\"This is how I disappear\\") as well.  Some of the songs are still a bit contrived such as the beginning of the Black Parade but MCR has definitely moved beyond its goth punk roots to show some amazing maturity.  Gerard Way and company have shown that they have real substance. Which is great considering so many bands sound the same now and will not depart from the standard formula.  It is still an MCR album but it is much more. So deal with the Phil Spector Wall of Sound production and get an album that shows some daring -an artistic album that pulls from the roots of rock and manages to pull off a high energy album that drives at a frenetic pace from the start to the end.

I dug LTE (Mike Portnoy of DT's side project) and also Transatlantic, Portnoy's supergroup with Neal Morse.  I had heard of Morse because Portnoy always talked about how much he loves Spock's Beard.  So I checked them out with this album...and was blown away.    This is their first album, but is light years ahead of debuts of most bands, let alone prog bands.  The two epics on here, The Light and The Water, are simply STUNNING!  Go the Way You Go is fantastic, and the closer On the Edge is a rocker...wish it was longer.  This is one of the best prog albums I've ever heard and I'm definitely going to check out more Spock's Beard!

B00005JPAO|5.0|Stephen Fears follows one \\"A\\" movie \\"Mrs. Henderson Presents\\" with yet another of the same quality, \\"The Queen.\\" Most of the film has to do with the week or so after the untimely death of Princess Diana and the royal family's reaction to it and their totally misjudging the public's reaction. Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, because of their icy stoicism and, more importantly, their total distaste for the princess, were all set to stay at Balmoral, ignore the press, make no public statement, have a small private funeral and let Prince Philip take Princess Diana's sons hunting to divert them from their sorrow. The royal couple, as the whole world now knows, got their comeuppance, and at the eleventh hour, managed to do the right thing but not without the help of a very determined Tony Blair.<br /><br />The acting is excellent with only the Queen Mother being miscast. Dame Helen Mirren convinces you she is the queen; both Prince Philip and Prince Charles are believable; and Michael Sheen gives an outstanding performance as Prime Minister Tony Blair (\\"Just call me 'Tony'\\"). The movie belongs just as much to the prime minister as to the queen. There is a scene near the end of the film when Blair has an audience with Queen Elizabeth and she reminds him of the fickleness of the public. We are reminded, rather sadly, that he bought into a war that ultimately cost him his position.<br /><br />Although Fears of course covers the death and funeral of Princess Diana (\\"the people's Princess\\"), he does it with grace and respect and never  exploits the sad events. For example, her sons never speak nor are seen closeup. Additionally the actual footage of events at the time is so well integrated with the rest of the movie so that the two are indistinguishable, no small feat on the part of both the director and cinemaphotographer.<br /><br />The critics are already talking about an Oscar nomination for Mirren. She richly deserves one.
B000002GQK|4.0|This is in response to \\"Joe,\\" who thought that 13 yr. olds could write better songs than the compositions on this album.  First, I agree that this album has its flaws.  However, if I'm a 13 yr. old and my name is Mozart. . . .   <br /> <br />I happen to be a big fan of the Moody Blue's choice of topics for lyrics and musical instrumentation.  The \\"Big Issues\\" are usually addressed, not the ephemeral throw-away lyrics one finds in other rock bands of this time period (You know, the whole \\"sex-drugs-rocknroll\\" thing).  Having said that, even if a musician has a interesting theme and concept for an album, the music still has to sound good.   <br /> <br />One problem I see with this album is the replay factor.  I find myself having to wait weeks/months before replaying this album.  I think it's partly the arragements themselves; they seem more predictable than their past albums.  The use of verse/chorus/verse/bridge/chorus, while not strictly adhered to, shows up here, giving this album more of a \\"singles album\\" feel.  Case in point: \\"One More Time to Live.\\"  It starts out with a moderately-paced verse that builds to a pre-chorus (add the swelling mellotron) then leads to the impressively-sung chorus (Anyone familiar with one of Adam Sandler's regular skits on SNL will find this rhyming scheme interesting; was this Sandler's inspiration?) that supposedly narrates the cosmological beginnings and evolution in a chronological framework.  When I first heard this I was blown away; great stuff.  However, as I listened more and more, I found that the novelty started to wear off (hence, the need to wait weeks before replaying this). <br /> <br />In addition, as I mentioned, the songs seem capable of standing by themselves, contrasted with \\"Days of Future Passed\\" or \\"To Our Children's Children. . . .\\"  This by itself is not a bad thing; some of the best Beatles' records followed this pattern.  However, in the Moodies' case, it detracts from what they are capable of expressing with their deep lyrics and multiple instruments.  The best Moody albums for me, are the ones where one has to listen to the whole album to really experience their music.  On this album, I can turn it on, listen to 2-3 songs, and feel good.  If that's what you want, you can't go wrong here. <br /> <br />Another downside I noticed is connected with their previous albums and the expectations that people naturally have.  If they like something, they think, \\"Hey, why not repeat it?\\"  After listening to \\"To Our Children's,\\" some of the experimental approaches to songwriting seem noticeably missing from \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favor,\\" with the exception of Mike Pinder's interesting \\"My Song.\\" The verse/chorus/bridge pattern I mentioned does not stand out on their earlier albums, like it does here.  As a result, the replay value on those albums is quite high.     <br /> <br />However, in the end, this is a classic album.  Do yourself a favour, though, and indulge in its beauty sparingly.
0375751513|5.0|Dorian Gray, a young man of high English society, possesses a beauty that any man or women would long for. However, the reader soon realizes that even the purest beauty can not save us from the horrors and intrigue of sin. After seeing his portrait, Dorian curses the fact that soon his beauty will fade and declares \\"if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture to grow old! For that - I would give everything\\". Dorian soon finds that his ill-fated wish has come true, and his portrait now carries the burden of age. As the years pass, Dorian becomes obsessed with sins and evils, for they do not afflict his personal appearance, but rather aid in the deterioration of his portrait, his soul. But, although Dorian continues to sin and think nothing of the consequences of his actions, he is consumed with an overwhelming fear that his portrait and sins will be revealed to the world. Through the actions and sins of Dorian Gray, Oscar Wilde shows human's weakness to the evils of the world. Wilde urges all readers to renounce sinning for it leads to the deterioration of one's moral principles, but more importantly, creates an everlasting fear that can destroy one's soul and eventually destroy one's desire to live. This story should be read by teenagers everywhere for it shows that the true nature of our character is judged by the beauty of one's soul, rather than the beauty of one's face.

0060005696|5.0|We are living during a time of copious choice.  Prosperity washes us with abundant possibilities.  Yet, when we receive what we thought we wanted, we often find ourselves wanting.<br /><br />Barry Schwartz, a Swarthmore College professor, citing research results from psychologists, economists, market researchers and decision scientists makes five counter-intuitive arguments in this book, The Paradox of Choice: Why Less is More.  We would be better off if we:<br /><br />1. Voluntarily constrained our freedom of choice.<br /><br />2. Sought \\"good enough\\" instead of \\"the best.\\"<br /><br />3. Lowered our expectations about decision's results.<br /><br />4. Made nonreversible decisions.<br /><br />5. Paid less attention to what others around us do.<br /><br />Schwartz notes we are constantly being asked to make choices, even about the simplest things.  This forces us to \\"invest time, energy, and no small amount of self-doubt, and dread.\\" There comes a point, he contends, at which choice becomes debilitating rather than liberating.  Too much of a good thing becomes detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being, he states.<br /><br />In the final, Schwartz offers an 11-step program for reducing choice's \\"tyranny.\\"<br /><br />1. Choose when to choose.<br /><br />2. Be a Chooser, not a picker.<br /><br />3. Satisfice more; maximize less.<br /><br />4. Consider the opportunity costs of opportunity costs.<br /><br />5. Make your decisions nonreversible.<br /><br />6. Adopt an \\"attitude of gratitude.\\"<br /><br />7. Regret less.<br /><br />8. Anticipate adaptation.<br /><br />9. Control expectations.<br /><br />10. Curtail social comparisons.<br /><br />11. Learn to love constraints.<br /><br />I have always had trouble accepting the virtues of what Isaiah Berlin, the political philosopher, terms \\"negative liberty\\" or \\"freedom from.\\"  In my mind \\"positive liberty\\" or \\"freedom to\\" is always the preferred option.<br /><br />Schwartz's book makes a compelling case, however, that less can be more.

B000GCFO12|5.0|Silent Hill was a video game originally. The story of the movie is different, but so complex on many levels, that you might be confused in the beginning and especially at the end. It's a film, which will keep your mind occupied for many weeks and gives you plenty religious stuff to think about.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|V for Vendetta is one of my favorite movies of all time!  Natalie Portman is beautiful and gives an outstanding performance.  Really, I think this role demanded more from her than any of her previous performances.  This movie is pact full of plot twists and action.  It is a movie that should be in everyone's collection.

0618680004|5.0|Is Dawkins' most recent book merely \\"preaching to the choir,\\" as some have charged? No, clearly not. Its sales rank has been astonishingly strong, consistently hovering for several weeks between #2 and #5 out of all the books for sale in Amazon's 4 million+ catalog. Who are all these readers? Surely, they are not all already committed atheists. Many curious fence-sitters, agnostics, doubters, and even believers are undoubtedly finding this book a liberating experience; it will probably help get them over the stigma attached to the word \\"atheism.\\" Dawkins' own stated ambition, even grander, is as follows: \\"If this book works as I intend, religious readers who open it will be atheists when they put it down\\" (pg. 5).    No one can realistically expect that the book will suddenly convert droves of committed believers or that it will drive a stake through the hearts of the vast monotheistic traditions, tearing through our world with such a furious momentum of fervor and fear. But the book's potential to raise consciousness about issues such as the insulated, privileged position enjoyed by faith and even the validity of that concept could have wide-ranging long-term consequences. In other words, the book shows every sign of being an effective meme machine.     Dawkins' book should be placed squarely in the tradition of works by, among others, Voltaire, David Hume, Thomas Paine, Bertrand Russell, and Carl Sagan. These anti-religious thinkers have helped propagate the memes of skepticism, helping to create a larger and larger segment of the population that questions blind faith. Dawkins' compelling book continues that work, synthesizing a range of powerful arguments and ideas, including demolitions of the traditional proofs for the existence of a god, a demonstration of how complexity results from (rather than precedes) gradual processes such as natural selection, the anthropic principle, and the extra-religious origin and nature of morality. Perhaps most provocatively, Dawkins argues forcibly that religious indoctrination is a form of child abuse. We should teach children how to think not what.    This is Dawkins at his brilliant, witty best, razor sharp, mustering all sorts of facts, evidence, and lines of argument, and generally giving his philosophical foes a hard time of it. If human consciousness tends to move from animism to polytheism to monotheism to atheism, here is an important landmark marking the way of that final transition.    The master stroke of the book, for this reader at least, is the sustained analogy in chapter 5 between a moth's steering by starlight and a human child's obedience to \\"tribal elders\\". Both behaviors are apparently hardwired; both are typically productive survival strategies; but both can go disastrously wrong--another moth in the candle flame, another brainwashed suicide bomber who has been taught paradise awaits.    Open minds will not fail to be impressed. _The God Delusion_ will undoubtedly enlarge, well, not the choir (terrible metaphor here) but the academy of free thinkers.
1402545355|5.0|I never would have ''read'' this novel; listening to it however is something else again.  It makes for a wonderful audio book.  It is the story (or stories) of the main heroine and her family and friends with the occasional detecitve story mixed in for good measure.  The ''msytery'' element does keep you guessing. It is greatly enjoyable to hear the background stories of Ma Ramotswe and her life in Africa.  I purchased the 2nd volume before even finishing the first and a coworker is hooked on this sereies as well....she bought the other CDS so now we can share!  Very enjoyable audio experience and the narrator has a mellow, rich voice that is very easy to listen too and adds alot of character to the telling of the tales. Highly recommend this series.
0743298020|2.0|I have nothing against Ms. Diane Setterfield.       This book should get 5 stars for the writing, but 1 star for the plot.    It is very slow.  I managed to finish this book only because I was on vacation.       At the beginning of the book, there is an introduction of a twin of   Margaret where Margaret finds out by accident. I thought Margaret's   twin sister shall play a role in the later part of the book. Yet this   isn't happening.    It seems like most people like this book.  Perhaps I am a minority.    However, if this is a good \\"mystery\\" book, what do you say on any mystery   book by Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and David Cray?    Meanwhile, I did some research on this book and another title called   \\"The Interpretation of Murder\\".  There was an article on Wall Street   Journal about these two books recently.     Eventually, I found out marketing play an important role, i.e. the  million dollars auction, the promotion by local bookstores, etc.     I wonder if it is the success of the marketing.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|I have to admit that I do have some bias towards movies such as this - I am often drawn to dysfunctional family comedies. That being said, Little Miss Sunshine is a true gem, which sports one of the best ensemble casts you'll see all year.<br /><br />The story centers around the Hoovers, a dysfunctional family of six, who are making a last minute road trip from Albuquerque to Southern California in their beat-up VW bus so seven year old Olive can fufill her dream of competing in the Little Miss Sunshine Pageant.<br /><br />Olive is not notified of her ability to compete in the pageant until the last minute, which sends the family into a tailspin on getting her to the competition. Due to a variety of circumstances, the entire Hoover clan (all 6 of them) must travel together to the pageant in the only family vehicle large enough to haul them all: a well-aged, tempermental, bright yellow VW bus. Along the way, various situations occur which test every member of the family, and ultimately brings them all closer together as the movie ties up with the most fantastic scene ever to grace the stage of a pageant competition: Olive competing in the talent portion of the contest.<br /><br />Cast of characters:<br />Richard Hoover (played by Greg Kinear): a completely unsuccessful motivational speaker, whose entire existence is hinging on a book deal, the likes of which is, ironically, a book about success.<br /><br />Sheryl Hoover (played by Toni Collette): the patient, supportive mother who is running out of patience for her increasingly unsuccessful husband and his inability to seal the book deal.<br /><br />Olive Hoover (played by Abigail Breslin): a slightly chubby, bespeckled, ordinary 7 year old girl who dreams of winning the Little Miss Sunshine pageant.<br /><br />Dwayne Hoover (played by Paul Dano): the angsty yet thoughtful teenager who has taken a vow of silence until he accomplishes his dream of becoming a fighter pilot.<br /><br />Uncle Frank (played by Steve Carell): Sheryl's brother (a renowned Proust scholar), who just happens to be severely depressed and suicidal.<br /><br />Grandpa (played by Alan Arkin): the cantankerous libido and heroin-fueled old man who helps Olive with the talent (dance) portion of the pageant.appens to be severely depressed and suicidal.

B00005JPBP|4.0|`The Prestige' is an intriguing magician story that provides a spine-tingling movie experience as the film moves along.  Ably acted by key players and directed with finesse by `Memento' and `Batman Begins' director, Christopher Nolan, the film builds up a nasty rivalry amongst magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman).  They start out as understudies for senior magician, Cutter (Michael Caine), and practice by being the staged volunteers for certain magic tricks.  Tragedy comes one day when Alfred works out an alternative knot to tie assistant, Julia Angier (Piper Perato), Robert's wife, for a Houdini-like trick, being tied inside a water tank for a staged escape.  It goes all wrong, and it is unclear if Alfred tied her in an inescapable knot.  He can't remember which knot he made, which provides a haunting cast of suspicion and doubt.  She dies, leaving Robert heartbroken, but her loss brings a constant trail of revenge and counter-revenge as both players play tricks on one another, breaking one another's secrets and limbs.  Robert and Alfred take their rivalry on stage where each tries to outdo one another.  Robert replaces his assistant and wife with a mistress, Olivia Wenscombe(Scarlett Johansson), who is not enough consolation, but her own bitterness provides a tie with his rival, Alfred, with results that seem sleight-of-hand.    `The Prestige' becomes a taut and impressive display of tricks played on the stage and with the audience.  There is also a historical rivalry between the brilliant eccentric inventor, Tesla (David Bowie), and Thomas Edison that gives the whole affair more depth and meaning.   The suspense, as with any magic show, is impressive as is some of the delivery.  `The Prestige' is expert at making one guess what will happen next. With plenty of steps and a few missteps, `The Prestige' offers a dark, but delightful show, even if some of the magic is too unbelievable even when seen.
1594200653|3.0|This book lacks a good presentation, therefore it lost me, and probably many other readers as well.  I'd imagine this text is intended to be sold to students and scholars, and although scholars might like the format, students will hate it.  The book has a constant feel of jumping from place to place without any transition.  Even something like subtitles in the chapters would have helped the reader focus a bit more, but even that is non-existant.  Rather it just seems like Judt is rambling on, throwing in numbers and facts when necessary.  The book also downplays the role of America in shaping European history.  I would not recommend this book to anyone who doesn't know European history in the second half of the 20th century well already, because you will have a hard time following Judt's presentation.
