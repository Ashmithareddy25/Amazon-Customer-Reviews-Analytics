B002VPE1WK|5.0|Good, easy and convenient. I was looking for something like this since i bought my SLR. I am hoping to use it for my long trip.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Can't wait to read book 2 :) I hope Katniss and Peeta stay together! I hope book 2 is just as good!
B00A80SHFM|1.0|This leaves out some of the best songs and best parts of songs.  As a whole the sound track is great but the highlights just does not do it for me.  They need to release the full score.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am inspired as a writer and impressed as reader I now hunger for the second book this was am amazing read
B0015DROBO|3.0|I finished  this book in about a week and a half. It reads like an episode  of CSI. Truthfully, it`s  between 3-4 stars to me. It's well-written and Larsen keeps the story intriguing with lots of little twists and turns; however, it's not an amazing piece  of literature. Even though it's garishly interesting, I'm not a huge fan of reading about sadist and creeps who torture women. He clearly speaks out against them, I just hope the next novel isn't so focused on the topic.
B0072KZ0Z6|4.0|My wife is a huge fan and she has gotten me hooked onto this show. At first, I thought that it was stupid, but it grew on me. Gotta love Schmitt!

B007TXN4TK|1.0|It took forever to load.  Seems like a nice idea but not impressed. wish there were simpler pieces to practice with
B00003CX5P|5.0|From a random gift idea to finding exactly what I was searching for, this item took a bit of time to locate. But it was worth it to be able to share with my Mom and family, since they had never seen it before.
0765325950|4.0|The book is fantastic. I loved the entire thing. But it needs to be in Ebook form, I have read books same size as these in paperback, and they are easier to carry then this one because it is hardback. Will defiantly buy the Ebook version if it comes out that way I can re-read it on my kindle and highlight certain things etc... But it would be way better if it came out in Ebook version instantly.
B008XG1X18|4.0|This is a great app for the fire, easy to maneuver,nice big pictures, and I've found the speed is pretty quick too!

1476719071|3.0|So I have been hearing about this one for ages and I finally just had to see what all the rage was about. In Beautiful Disaster, I found a story that was charming to the last page filled with a great cast of characters that I really loved.<br /><br />The plot was interesting. The first half or so I absolutely loved. I thought everything was absolutely perfect. Then I got to a point where some plot points felt so out of place and I found myself asking where they had come from. They weren't developed enough for me to grasp a full understanding of them I felt, so they seemed odd and really random to me. There was also some crazy things that happen that didn't seem realistic. I loved all the witty banter between America and the other characters - it was so fun to read.<br /><br />The characters in Beautiful Disaster were pretty awesome.  I just loved them! Abby was a great main character though she was one of my least favorite characters of the book. Finch was cool, as was America. I would love to have friends like them! America was so impulsive, sweet, and caring! Travis was such a hunk, though some of the crazy things he did were a bit unsettling.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire was a pretty good read. Fans of contemporary should definitely give this one a try. I had some issues with the plot, but once I moved past that is was a really enjoyable book.
B003WQT2YY|1.0|This movie was not the one that was at the movie theaters. It depicted a couple that was mean to each other and vile.  I didn't like it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Others were right, Peeta needed to be more involved and Katniss got annoying after a while. I hope it translates to film well.
B003MC5N28|4.0|A great read for teens but I would not recommend this book for younger children because of the content this not how babies come into this world.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great writing, and more twists and turns than imaginable.  Just when you think you have the answer, another turn comes into play.  What a ride!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love the big bright display. This calculator is perfect, and easy to use. Can't get better than free! Thank you.
B005LAII8K|4.0|Like most time travel movies - if you think about it too much, the logic will fall apart and with it your enjoyment of the film. However, \\"Looper\\" isn't really about time travel, or telekinesis and it certainly isn't a special effects heavy popcorn movie.<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" is a well-acted study of what it is to be human - growth, change, fear, love, greed, guilt, sacrifice and how we justify our actions. The performances make the film, the story however, has been cobbled together from a hundred other movies you've seen before. The special effects and production design for a story set decades in the future are just okay - so don't expect much and you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />It's entertaining, and worth the purchase - and you'll only need to make space for one BluRay because there is not going to be a \\"Looper 2\\".  Loop closed.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|An amazing adventure of some of my favorite characters. The book differs from the movie but is really enjoyable and a good read
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's kindle. On my phone. It works. I can read my books on the bus even if I forget my kindle. It's great. No complaints.
0374214913|3.0|This book started off well and evolved into an interesting mystery. I was fully invested until I got about fifty percent into the book. Then it all started to fall apart. The author made the fatal mistake of having so much going on, that he forgot to do the basic task of making sure his characters were realistic. When the main character leaves his job after an all night shift at the bookstore and ride a train to google and spend the entire day at Google having a book scanned and then goes home and talks to his roommates and then goes back to work I was surprised that the author didn't even realize he made the character inhuman by not allowing him to sleep within a 48 hour period. I understand you want to have action and keep the flow of mystery up, but no one is superhuman! And it just moved that way for many of the characters. They were too perfect, they all were too bright, too ingenious. The main character was the only one who didn't seem to have some superskill- his own company where he hires super bright hackers, a super bright google worker who has every resource at her disposal, an incredibly talented ILM roommate. If I were the main character I would be wondering what happened to me, not running all over the country solving puzzles. It just didn't seem plausible. There were parts of the book that were very suspenseful, but it was wrapped up in a nice little bow at the end, and just too complicated for many people. And I agree with many of the other reviews..... enough about Google! Did you get an endowment from them to write this book? It was quite annoying how they were portrayed as the only place one would ever want to work. We get it, you like Google. Also, there were so many things introduced and then never brought up again. Why would this ILM roommate need to take pictures of every surface of the bookstore when the bookstore closes and they never mention it again. What was all that for? Why is he building a town in his apartment. What was he intending to do with it? There was just too much thrown into 300 pages.  Inevitably, I think he let his ambition of providing too much information and detail get in the way of what was actually achieved in his story.  This caused the story to suffer and the book to end in the reader being a bit disappointed at what could have been.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I couldn't put it down and looked forward to the next page!<br />Had a good plot twist that I didn't see coming.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I loved the story line of this movie about a daughter and father relationship. Clint Eastwood was brilliant as always.I also think it helps to prove that we do grow wiser with age.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I have no issues with these controllers.  If you are going to get replacment or additional controllers for your play station, I would recommend these.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Exciting  well worth the money. And room for more exploits from Hugh. This  sounds like Cheyenne Mountain we are closer than we think
B0087YYHZU|5.0|I've seen this film in film class and it is with out doubt the best musical of all time. I highly recommend purchasing this film, you will not be disappointed.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I liked that there were many different levels and areas to play. It got a little confusing at times but it gives good hints when you are stuck.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not used to this kind of writting (interview like) but is very entertaining and each interview gives you a little piece of the turmoil World War Z brought to the world.<br /><br />Is a insightful critical view to some of our systems flaws.<br /><br />I recommend it.
0452270073|1.0|I really disliked this book. It made some interesting points about therapy and war, but in general I did not love reading it. It was however, an easy read and i needed it for a class.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|One of the best books i've read. Give it a shot! specially if you lived in the 80's<br /><br />Kind Regards

B0053Q9DQI|5.0|I love this movie! It's a good story to start with but these actors bring a lot to these characters. I actually bought this for my daughter for a Christmas gift, because she loves Michael Fassbender, but I love it too!
B0079R8KO0|1.0|I purchased this case for a Kindle that I was giving my grandson for Christmas.  Although the case was sturdy, it was impossible to pop the Kindle into the 4 &#34;hooks&#34; it had and so it was impossible to secure it.  I ended up going to a store near my home to buy a case that was much more suited for an 8 year old.  Don't waste your money!
0374533571|5.0|Saw the movie but the book is better.  Highly recommended if you like this subject matter.  A guy a little off center and aren't we all to varying degrees.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use. Light touch is nice. Have only done basic, so cannot comment on more complicated versions of game.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Extremely easy to use with multiple settings for one time reminders or repeated events. The wake up tones are vast enough to designate every event with its own ringtone. Or download from music library. Worth every cent!

B000F8O35U|5.0|Package arrived in great shape.  Item ordered was received in a timely matter.  Appreciate the great service.  have good day.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I began reading the book and immediately fell in love with the characters. I became absorbed by the memories and the love they had for each other. It's important to remind ourselves as a parent or parent's to show our child(ren) the routes of  communication are always open regardless of how alone they must feel that there's no way out of pain. In this day we can place so much pressure on our kids they feel the need to be perfect, when all we want is the best for them. Although fiction I can see this being realistic. Excellent read.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|Package arrived in great shape.  Item ordered was received in a timely matter.  Appreciate the great service.  have good day.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not bad for free, just didn't care for the interface and that I had to play games i didn't like to unlock other games.

B004EC5IV6|3.0|While Evagelion 1.11 was a good condensation of the traditional story arc,  Evangelion: 2.22 You Can (Not) Advance is caught in a problem with too many characters and too much plot being covered in too little time.<br /><br />Character development suffered as a result and, since this is at the core of the appeal of this story for me it left me feeling let down. Auska suffered worst as she was barely introduced before she was being pushed out. It's not just her though. Mari, a new character who barely appeared in 1.11 is not filled in and is still an enigma as the story starts it's terminal phase. Ryoji Kaji, Auska and Misato Katsuragi's love interest is reduced to just another bit character.<br /><br />I can't cover it all because it's too much but so many characters were introduced and than 'fast forwarded' over that my only reaction could best be described in anime style as ........ or maybe &#34;Huh?!&#34;, are they serious?<br /><br />As positive as I was on 1.11, 2.22 left me thinking that this release of Evangelion was badly botched. I'm wondering if they can recover in 3.33 and if I even want to bother finding out.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I bought this for my 4 year old Granddaughter and she loved it.  She plays with it for hours on end and never seems to get bored with it.  It reminds me of the old color-form toys and brings the same kind of enjoyment.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It is a great gift.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is one of the best hidden object games that I have played. It has a good storyline and the graphics were also good. Would love to see more like this. It was easy to play with plenty of hints if needed.
0385341008|5.0|I got this book as a gift for my wife. She had it read in just a few days. She wont tell me anything about it, but insists that I read it.
B005R2PDL2|5.0|I listen to this over and over. Never get tired of it. It's just great for yoga! I highly recommend it.
630471193X|5.0|We love this movie. We had tried to rent it but no one carried it so decided to just buy it online. It was perfect.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I was introduced to the game Journey through Video Games Live, where I learned that it's soundtrack is the first game soundtrack to be nominated for a grammy award.  Then I set out to buy the soundtrack, but then saw I could get the game and soundtrack together with extra games and extra game soundtracks.  So I got this here collector's edition.<br /><br />The game itself is amazing, and in my opinion can be best enjoyed not knowing all about it so it's best to just leave describing it as vague.  It's not a challenging game by any means, but it can seem more like an exhilarating ride.  First time through I did mostly everything solo.  After completing it I couldn't help thinking about it constantly, then had to play through it again the next day.  Seeing the benefit of playing closely (literally, close) to another player makes it so you don't want to leave their side, and makes the game even more emotional... interesting how a game that seems so simple in concept and so short can be so emotionally powerful, much like seeing a really good movie.<br /><br />The soundtrack is quite simply put, stunning, those last two songs just absolutely amazing.  I can definitely see why it was noticed by the grammy's.<br /><br />This game is a work of art.  Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />All three of these included games can be viewed as very nice stress relievers.  They don't do much to bring stress.  You generally can't lose.  Most games nowadays tend to stress me out, and then I have to wonder why I'm deliberately doing something to cause my frustrations, so I'm not much a gamer anymore these days.  But I'll certainly play these games.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|The game is simple yet enjoyable and easy to pick up and start again after putting it down the last time.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a must-see! I am officially a &#34;Walking Dead&#34; addict--I can't get enough!!!! !!! !!!! !!!! !!! !!! !!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I have read all of the books. Its been a long time since I have read this many books back to back. I just could not put them down. I could not wait to see the DVDs.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Bravo. Did it again...Cant wait for d next episode.Just absolutely luv this show.Nothing tops this.Acting and directing cast and crew just work so well together I guess to be able to pull this feat w aplomb ....Again kudos.!
1400069181|5.0|I loved this book, it's concept and everything Blake had to write about.  This book is a real inspiration and motivation to DO SOMETHING positive with your life!
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|I can remember the first time a film within the horror genre moved me, and that was \\"Carrie\\".<br /><br />It must have been the pain and sadness, and the depth which we were able to look deep within Carrie White that affected me so heavily. Like Sissy Spacek gave a great and convincing performance, so did Mark Gibson as Edward Young in \\"Exit to humanity\\".  The excellent acting of the mourning-main character is what grabs you so quickly and then allows the brilliance of the script, writing, cinematography, direction and the mood of the film to carry and captivate you throughout and to the end.<br /><br />I dont know if i have ever seen such dynamite performances in a Zombie movie...ever. The original Dawn of the Dead.. 28 Days later, all had characters we had become attached to, but were we emotionally moved by them? I believe it was more so of a cheering and rooting-on of those characters. In \\"Exit\\" I became concerned as to how Edward Young would cope with his pain, and what wisdom he could obtain and give us, the viewer. So many fine performances form several actors including Dee Wallace who was exceptional.<br /><br />With strong atmosphere and make-up effects \\"Edge\\" showed greatness without the use of intense gore, something we expect from a Zombie movie, and tend to look forward to, but its absence in no way whatsoever took anything away from it. The soundtrack was top notch, and definitely a part of the equation to stir ones emotions along with the acting. The unique take and possible cause of the Zombie plague that has kept fans of the genre wondering, \\"why?\\", was well done. Also, i would never have thought that you could tell me a post Civil-War Tennessee zombie flick could be convincing by any means, but it utterly did, and i never questioned the period piece aspect of the film once during my viewing. I was captivated. I was moved. It has been quite some time since i have been more than just 'satisfied' with a horror flick... I was 'fulfilled'. I also thoughtthe animated sequences added an authenticity to the narratives as well.<br /><br />I leave it to you to analyze the plot etc, etc, BUT, for those who appreciate good films of any genre, you need to watch this. Many people say its so much more than a Horror film, i guess it is. The point a superb film makes, is that it takes you far beyond its simplistic, classified category; Action, Comedy, Drama, Love story... it allows you to think, examine and ponder so many of its elements that it keeps you thinking.<br /><br />What a great film.<br /><br />Peace
0345803507|4.0|Just thought I'd get the 50 Shades of Grey to check it out for some light summer reading...ended up with all three of the Fifty Shades Trilogy.  Blushing all the way to the beach with these juicy novels.
B008LC8TJI|4.0|Huge fan of Maroon5....overall I am enjoying the CD although a couple of songs seem like &#34;fillers&#34;....But then again it is rare to find a CD and like all the songs on it.
0345803485|4.0|I thought I'd like a little light reading for the summer at the beach and heard this was a good read...Decided because of the price on Amazon to get all three books of the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy and was so happy I did!  I went from one book to the next seamlessly without having to wait for the next book to become available at the library.  Can't tell if the sun sunburned my face, or if it's still from blushing, but this trilogy is well worth the cost for beach reading...or winter reading for that matter.  Fifty shades of blushing going on...and loving the whole Trilogy!
B008J34466|4.0|Been a fan since I heard &#34;There You Go&#34; while stationed in Germany. The CD is fun and upbeat while sending a message about relationships and love.
0345803493|4.0|I needed a little light reading for the beach...decided for the price I'd get all three books!  WOW...glad I did!
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Love her voice and her lyrics. One of the best CDs I have heard in a long time. I listen to it almost every day!!!
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I can't say enough about how nice it is to have the complete works of Downton Abbey at your fingertips for refresher for yourself, or for getting a friend hooked on it when she (or he) has missed it in the past on PBS.  We have &#34;Downton Night&#34; dinners and play an episode ( or three) afterwords.  Such a great way to share in the wonderful story...like a book club only faster!  Can't wait for Season three!!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Disney does it again! My three year old and my four year old both love this movie. It keeps their attention throughout!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Lee Child still writes interesting enough stories that I can't stop reading, even though I do not want the story to end.  Jack still kicks butt, and I wish he was real!
B004FK24ZA|1.0|A terrible plot about an angel that falls in love with a bishop's wife.  Very unenjoyable.  Avoid this movie, always.  The Bishop's Wife
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Sometimes sequels are terrible. But the scorch trials was really good.  It didn't have as many cliff hangers at the end of chapters that intrigued me to keep reading as book 1 but the story to me was even better in book two.  I've gotten to know the characters better in this book.  It also kept me on my toes more.  Like I literally made the mistake of reading it in the dark and was totally freaked out in several chapters. I really enjoyed the detail that the author used to make readers see, feel, and hear what is happening.  There are tons of plot twists and turns that I couldn't foresee which is why I loved this book and gave it a 5 star rating.
B007FO5PYK|5.0|I have been told for many years that bu-ray is the best quality and was not impressed.Now that the older,GOOD movies are being remastered,I now see the difference!<br />Thank you!
B0076DELIG|4.0|The Black Box by Michael Connelly is well written, characters are  believable and interesting.  Story line holds together nicely and there is enough tension.
0547848412|5.0|Life of pi is a really good book and I would recommend that everyone should read this book! Pi is such a great character and it is a very well written book.
6305882592|5.0|MOVIE CAME VERY FAST,<br />SO GLAD A FRIEND BOUGHT ONE SO I CAN SEE<br />IT. I WILL WATCH IT MANY TIMES OVER.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|So happy to have read this charming, real coming of age novel! Loved all the characters so much. Can't wait to check out the film!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|The most inspiring from the darkness to light stories I've ever read. A salute to all the brave men and women of America's military.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|A charming story, told entirely visually (except for the haunting &#34;Walking in the Air&#34;). Simply drawn in a colored-pencil style, this short film chronicles the dreamy adventures of a young boy and the snowman he built that day. Lots of silly fun in the yard and in the house, until the snowman takes the boy on a special trip up North, where he cavorts with a crowd of happy snowmen, and even gets to meet Santa Claus.<br /><br />A wonderful film for all ages, especially the very young; because there's no dialogue, adult viewers can engage children in running commentary on the action.<br /><br />Note that this version is the original -- David Bowie does NOT appear.
B007FJFDXS|1.0|Well, first of all, it stinks. I don't like the point of the game, I just hate it. second, it never does what you want it to do. I've played it like twenty times and it doesn't work.
0425252868|5.0|I'm a pretty tough critic when it comes to WWII historical accounts, but this book was terrific!  It gave great insights, not only to the war incident between these two pilots, but also into the fascinating details leading up to their encounter... and after the war ended.  I mean it when I say... I could not put the book down!!  A great example of Christian love... during the most brutal war in world history.
B009PNQUXO|4.0|This is a very good app but sometime it doesn't want to work. you may have to try a few times before it will work properly.
B00000DCHI|5.0|the whole album is awesome and brings back alot of good old memories for me and my husband.  It was for him that I bought for him for christmas
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a great book and really made you think about things.  I thought it was a great book.  The ending will really get you.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Mark Wahlberg is funny, but the casting and script are terrible. Mark should stick to his tough guy role. We stopped this train reck at 15 minutes, because we couldn't tolerate it. I'm 57 and my GF is 52, but if you're in another age category, there is a very slight chance tha you'd find this thing (movie) to be funny. Watch the Candidate.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game rocks the graffics are awesome the game play , theres none better I would have paid money for this game it's that good Addictive as hell
B00AMBH70S|5.0|could be confusing if your not familiar with the other three movies stands alone as a pretty good flick great.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book had me from the very first chapter and it was very hard for me to ever put it down. This book hits all your feelings and emotions through out the story. If you are a Nicholas Sparks fan, this is a MUST READ. Even if you haven't really even gotten into his books before, this is a must. This shows no matter what has happened in your past, there will be people that will love you no matter what.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|These characters portray every facet of the human spirit, regardless of age, gender, religion, social class, or time period.<br />It is truly timeless, and enthralling to watch the twists and turns of plot, and their reactions of treachery, as well as heroism.<br />Very inspiring to treat our fellow man with kindness, as we are all just struggling to do our best in any given situation.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked this book so much that I bought the physical book, the Kindle version, and the version read by the author on CD!  I have read many NDE books and most of them are very similar.  They are usually good as far as they go but they don't really describe the afterlife in any detail except to say they (most of them) didn't want to come back.  The author did describe the afterlife as he saw it in pretty good detail.  In some respcts his experiences in the afterlife were pretty unique, but then other people also had different experiences from others.  We are all going to go there someday and I am interested in reading as much as possible what to expect.  Sounded like a pleasant experience except for the goo or slime part of it.  Nice he got to meet his dead sister.  In fact that was one big place his account did differ from others--no dead relatives to meet him.  But eventually he realized his sister did greet him.  Anyhow well worth reading and my sister also bought the book and the audiobook and loved it too.
1423151054|5.0|Simply Amazing, I wish Disney release MORE material like this ... Toooo good..<br /><br />Animator Survival kits + these flipbooks are perfect combo :)<br /><br />Regards
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A great movie with a wonderful message for nostalgia buffs, which at some point includes most of us. Beautiful mood movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. However,I didn't give it five stars due to the fact that I actually could put it down. Is that silly? I enjoyed the twists the book held. I did get emotional during different moments, and I thought Colleen did a great job with the evolution of the story. I also really enjoyed the ending. Some books don't give you the closure you need, or just end really crappy. I thought this ending was perfect, and actually entwined the story together even further.

B001CEE1YE|5.0|What can I say...I really am happy I bought the blu ray versions.  There really was a difference in sound and picture, although the story is the same but overall I am happy.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I have a preference for any book that takes a new critical look at our culture today, and quiet does this.  Through the analysis of not just how our culture in America has become more extroverted, but the deeper why.  And it it provides solutions as well. It's a needed break from the persistance of our self help extrovert ideal society.  She lost me abit on her 20 question introvert or extrovert approach to personality, but she does fleetingly address more middle of the road people once or twice.
B002CGSYNU|5.0|great product, arrived on time and in great shape.  looking for future business.  keep up the great products on here.

B005ELZKWS|4.0|Instead of hitting the dreaded sophomore slump, Chickenfoot decided to go ahead and name their 2nd album III.  As with the first album Chickenfoot III is exactly what you would expect from a band that features Sammy Hagar, Joe Satriani, Chad Smith and Mike Anthony.  No holds barred classic party rock with the occasional more serious lyric thrown in for good measure.  Hagar's voice is still amazing at his advanced age and Satriani can still shred with the best of them.  Mike Anthony's background vocals along with Satriani's pyrotechnics make many of these tracks sound very similar to Hagar era Van Halen.  Overall I think the songwriting on this one is quite a bit better than their debut.  Highlights include, \\"Up Next\\", \\"Three And A Half Letters\\", \\"Big Foot\\", and \\"Dubai Blues\\".  Some of Sammy's lyrics are actually rather cleaver, and thought a bit beyond his his usual good time Hagar party songs.  If you liked the first album I would think you would like this one.  If you did not like the first one, you might want to give this a chance as it is a rather significant improvement.
B004SBULWE|5.0|This is a great tool, I never realized that the programs continue to run and kill my battery even though I close them.
B000002KOO|4.0|I have never really explored the pre-Buckingham / Nicks era of Fleetwood Mac so I thought this would be a good place to start as it seems to be highly regarded by fans.  The Peter Green version of the band is all fresh to my ears and I am enjoying hearing this music for the first time.  I believe this was the first album to also include Danny Kirwin who is certainly an iatrical part of the musical mix here.  Yes, some of the material here sounds quite dated (especially the more ballad oriented stuff), but much of it holds up really well too.  Of course the album contains one of the all time classic guitar riffs of the 60's with \\"Oh Well\\", and the classic blues romp \\"Rattlesnake Shake\\" can be found here as well.  If it is jamming you want, it does not get much better than the \\"Searching For Madge / \\"Fighting For Madge\\" section of the album.  This is all very good stuff and I will definitely be seeking out more from the early days of the Mac.
B002RSDW80|5.0|The movie arrived sooner than expected and in perfect shape.  This was a good thing since I gave it as a Christmas gift along with the cookbook.  Big hit!
B002NXOQF2|5.0|I loved this book, and have read it many, many times. This is a copy to replace my old, very tattered one.
B00A8LYYI0|1.0|The Silent Hill franchise is a more of psychological horror and, like the last terrible movie, this one aims to focus on more American-style horror which doesn't mesh well at all with what Silent Hill offers. And again the casting is faulty with Sean Bean playing the father as if his role in the first movie was any good. Yelling at nuns with Sean Bean anyone? The fact that someone actually thought that was a good idea is beyond me. And like the first movie this one barely makes any sense plot-wise although I could say the plot in this one is even more convaluted than the last. It seems like this film is relying waaay too much on 3-D effects which is so irritating because Silent Hill isn't about cheesy jump scares. And of course Mister Red Pyramid makes another appearance for no reason seeing as he's a manifestation James Sunderlands withering psyche. James is the main character of Silent Hill 2 by the way. This movie pulls from the 3rd game in the series where Pyramid Head made no appearances whatsoever. The fact that they've included him in both movies just seems so thoughtless. And Cheryl just up and changing her name to Heather (the protagonist of SH3)? Really??? That's all they could come up with to include Heather? Wow.<br /><br />It's like Konami is trying it's hardest to completely shame the Silent Hill franchise with the release of not only these movies but every game after Silent Hill 4. It wasn't even scarey. Every attempt to shock and scare left me giggling to all-out laughter.<br /><br />It's got some pretty sgi effects too. Y'like pretty special gimmicky effects? You might enjoy this a bit then.<br /><br />Otherwise, don't waste your time. Don't waste your money. Watching a dog lick itself would be more entertaining than this mess of a movie.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Surprised I received this on my kindle for free!  Love It!  Great for keeping from getting board while standing in line.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Don't assume that this is a horror story, it isn't. Also don't assume it's a cheesy time travel story, it definitely isn't. What it is is a great story that makes time travel realistic and not so sci-fi. It also is an interesting take on late 50's early 60's America, unlike anything really. It makes you think... I recommend this book.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Great Christmas CD ..good audio quality..it is a new favorite for the holidays. Michael Bubble has a great voice with classic Christmas songs
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down.\\"<br /><br />Colleen freaking Hoover has DONE IT AGAIN! (Actually she's completely outdone herself). Talk about a journey of unknown self preservation and heartache carefully layered beneath a BAM* - WHOA* - HOLY COW* - NO WAY*- AHHHHHH* and finally resting peacefully, wrapped in the retribution and healing of love and DEAN \\"Dagnabit I need him\\" Holder's arms. Who would have known WHY she ultimately can't shake him ... or why she inevitably wouldn't want to. I'd ride this roller coaster of loss and love over and over again. THANK YOU COLLEEN HOOVER!<br /><br />\\"I knew in that moment that I was in love with you. I was in love with the way you loved me. When you wrapped your arms around me and held me, I knew that no matter what happened with my life, you were my home. You stole the biggest part of my heart that night. \\"
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|Big Big Train has proven time and again that they are completely different from anything else out there and that they're absolutely amazing at what they do. This album is labeled as a Part One, so I'm assuming there will be a follow up album continuing the musical themes and trends established here on English Electric. If you're new to Big Big Train you can trust this album to be quite the treat for you ears but then you've also got an amazing backlog to go through to understand and delight in the versatility of this band. Absolutely stunning!<br /><br />The album arrived before the deadline and was in excellent condition.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|Very happy with this!!!!!  Love the show!!!!  Would definitely rate it with a 5-star rating.  One of the funniest new shows.

B005LAII08|5.0|Especially in Disney (ironic they own Pixar now).  There are so few movie that will empower young girls.  No role models.  That is to say, none that dont get &#34;saved&#34; by Men within the movie.  Mulan was the closest perhaps.  But think about it, in must female lead animated movies, even the heroine gets rescued or saved by a man.  Why not give the girls a real role model.  Merida (spelling?) comes really really close.  Not the best Pixar effort, but the subject content is good, and our girls Love it.  That along make it worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|If you are going to buy this book, be warned its addicting and really hard to put down. You will love it!
B009LA1QW6|4.0|Paradise is an \\"afterthought\\" on Born to Die. It has less overbearing production with more synth and electric guitar sounds and a more understated orchestra. The vocal style is also less dynamic than BTD so the pace seems slower. However, LDR's sense of melody and vocal drama is still very strong. I would give it five stars on the basis of quality, but I ended up giving four stars for quantity. Only two or three more songs would make a full release, and of the many awesome leaked/unreleased songs revealed during 2012, there were some that fit the mood of the EP. Further, two songs on Paradise are technically beforethoughts. One is \\"Blue Velvet\\", a faithful cover of a famous old song, which showcases her voice in a smooth/controlled mode.  Another is \\"Yayo\\" from \\"Lana Del Ray aka Lizzy Grant\\", a pre-debut (?) album commercially unavailable for reasons I've never understood. Paradise's Yayo is faithful to its original but more stripped-down and echoey. It has a jazzier and more emotional singing style than the rest of Paradise and makes for a really great song; however, does re-visiting Yayo mean a re-release of \\"... aka Lizzy Grant\\" is coming (a 5-star release), or is it some kind of salvage operation?<br /><br />The new songs on Paradise, written after BTD, seem movie inspired in their feel. They are strangely similar to each other, and are impressively distinct in style from BTD. Fans and reviewers have different opinions of what's strong and weak, which I take to be a sign of interesting work. \\"Ride\\" is like a laid-back but amply orchestrated country/folk song. Check out the Ride video on youtube, one of the more controversial videos of 2012; also google \\"indexmagazine lizzy grant\\" for an interview that might suggest she had projects like the Ride video and the Paradise musical style in mind back in 2008.  \\"American\\" might be a make-up song to the United States with whom she's had less media exposure and more nasty reviews than in Europe.  However, her US relationship seems less about fans that love her and anti-fans that hate her but more a strong fan-base vs. some US musical establishments/pundits trying to dismiss her. To me, this is the most interesting kind of polarization an artist can have. So, imo, \\"American\\" is best considered just a love song to Americans, United States included, but also the entire continent (she's big in Mexico and Brazil). \\"Cola\\" has that wonderful line we were warned about 2 months prior to the release of Paradise (youtube Paradise Edition preview). Along with that lyric, which will never be heard in a mall, the song has some excellent relaxed skatting (wish it had more). \\"Body Electric\\" was first heard on youtube as a raw and over-the-top live performance from her 2012 tour. While many fans prefer it that way, the studio version still grips the listener with her vocals, ominous strings, dramatic (symphonic-style) drumming, and understated Hawaiian metal guitars. It differs from the live the way a studio version should, imo. \\"Gods and Monsters\\" is a (seemingly) angry, disillusioned song about \\"innocence lost\\" (aka debauchery). Some media reviews suggest the song refers to her recent life, but I think the situations probably just interest her artistically (she has \\"Nabokov Whitman\\" tattooed on her arm, afterall). Finally, \\"Bel Air\\" closes with a pretty direct acoustic-style tune elaborated by a memorable piano background. It's mellow and theatrical at the same time and was co-written with a movie-score composer that she knows (Daniel Heath). The whole EP is on Spotify (and some on youtube), so you can make up your own mind. My overall opinion is that Lana is well worth casting a commercial vote for, if you want to see pop music go more her way.ship seems less about fans that love her and anti-fans that hate her but more a strong fan-base vs. some US musical establishments/pundits trying to dismiss her.

B001IXSU8M|5.0|I was around twelve when I got this album, two years later and I am still listening to it and obsessed with it.<br />Here's my rating/explanation for each song:<br />Just Dance: Amazing and catchy song. Very \\"clubby\\". It is her first single and different from her newer stuff but still very good! 5/5 stars<br />LoveGame: Another single. Very interesting and the lyrics are entertaining! A good song to listen to when you want something fun and different 5/5 stars<br />Paparazzi: One word: Genius! Very smartly done and yet again... another big single for GaGa. It is different but amazing! And... The music video is very entertaining! :) 5/5 stars<br />Pokerface: Catchy, fun and a great song setup. Not your typical pop song but amazing nothingless! Such an amazing song that adds to her amazing album! 5/5 songs<br />Eh,Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say): Not one of my favorites off the album. A good song to make you feel better after a broken heart. Her voice is differnt in this song than in the others I feel. 4/5 stars<br />Beautiful, Dirty, Rich: A song that is while hard to relate too a fun song to listen to! You just can't help tapping your foot to her foreign beat that is very cool! 4.5/5 stars<br />The Fame: Another song that is hard to relate to personally but still a great song. It expresses her feelings toward \\"Fame\\". Lyrics are great! 4/5 stars<br />Money Honey: Such a catchy song! Fun electronic/dance/pop track. 4.5/5 stars<br />Starstruck: One of my favorites for sure! Very electronic with pop and rap sprinkled in! Great dance song and extremely cathcy, I will hum it even when I haven't listened to it in weeks! :) 5/5 stars<br />Boys Boys Boys: Catchy but not a favorite. Well done beat that is interesting. 4/5 stars<br />Paper Gangsta: I hate the word \\"SWAG\\" I think it's annoying and overused however... if something can have \\"SWAG\\" this song does! Great beat. Great lyrics. Great song! Rap mixed into a pop song that is very cool. A favorite. 5/5 stars<br />Brown Eyes: Very emotional! Talking about a break up. It is very relatable that helps me. 5/5 stars<br />I Like It Rough: GREAT SONG! Not many pop artists that venture out of there true love and kiss kiss kiss songs... this song does the complete opposite of that! It is about the person that hurts her (physically and mentally) but she wants to be with him. A favorite of mine. 5/5 stars<br />Summerboy: A fun song that can help lighten your mood. The beat makes you smile and a good song overall. 4/5 stars<br />Overall this album is amazing, different and such a rare debut album. I LOVE IT! I get it, some people get GaGa, some people don't. Her look, motives and, songs are the \\"love it or hate it\\" type stuff. If you haven't listened to this album at all listen to Just Dance, Paparazzi, Starstruck and, Paper Gangsta. They are different and show a variety of her types of songs. Don't make an opinion if you haven't listened to her music. If could I would give it 500,000,000 out of 5 stars! I can honestly not praise this album enough. Love the songs. Love the album. Love her. Happy listening! :)<br />~Andr&uuml;Very emotional! Talking about a break up.

B003O86FMW|4.0|This book follows \\"The Hunger Games\\" and what a sequel it is. Kept me turning the pages til the end. I highly recommended this book to anyone who likes action/adventure fiction. You'll be engaged by the twists and turns this book has almost every page. Great read.

I've given copies to<br />other Cat People, and even invaded my favorite<br />veterinary cat clinic with this book, and the Docs<br />and Techs all fell out of their chairs!  My fave<br />poems are the title poem (\\"I Could Pee on This\\"),<br />\\"Self Affirmation,\\" and \\"Why Are You Screaming?\\"<br />WOW!
B00000715U|4.0|Setting Sons is definitely better..but in terms of their early work, this one is certainly good still. It has a few timeless songs To Be Someone and Down In A Tube, and It's Too Bad.
B000007XUQ|5.0|What's not to like about the Carpenters? Her voice melts butter and the composition of Richard (her brother) is absolutely brilliant. I grew up listening to Karen Carpenter, so there's a lot of sentiment and nastalgia associated with her music; however, her voice transcends generations, in my humble opinion. The Christmas Collection is a classic, with an eclectic mix of music from traditional hymns to the Carpenter's originals. Great for commuting, decorating the tree, and baking both during the Christmas season and beyond.
B0044CE682|5.0|I am not a real TV person though I do have some faves that I watch. Maybe because I live in Hawaii and the Fox affiliate is not always Fox network, but I had NEVER seen Fringe until the Science channel picked it up and showed several episodes of Season 1, which I watched from the beginning only a few weeks ago. I LOVE Fringe, and finding it on Instant Streaming on Amazon is what made me spring for the $79 for Amazon Prime. But watching the show is a little bit like trying to eat one chip for me. I stayed up almost all night watching from the beginning of season 1.  I'm midway through the last episode of season 3 now, and I can't believe how quickly 45 minutes goes by. Fringe is by far my favorite show in recent years. The writing, production and acting are all top quality. I gave season 3 5 stars but I think it's more like 4 1/2 because it's not as good as Seasons 1 and 2. There is great chemistry between all of the cast members. I like that they developed the relationship between Olivia and Peter. Finding Walter Bishop in prison on the last show of season 3 was a surprise but I haven't seen the whole episode and don't want to have to give a spoiler alert anyway.<br /><br />Great show--and because I get the HD with unlimited streaming with the Amazon Prime annual fee, I will likely keep that going for a long time yet. Even when I've watched one show, I find that when I watch it again I get something from it that I didn't catch the first time.  It is really too bad that the current season 5 will be the last one. On a more positive note, I saw a preview for a movie at the theater yesterday that is by the three writers who do Fringe. That should be worth watching too.

1933492929|5.0|As an artist myself, with a fascination for animals here and the potential for them elsewhere in the universe, I cannot help but be fascinated by Terry Whitlach's work. I have long been a fan of hers and this book does not disappoint if you happen to be one as well. The artwork is fantastic enough but some of the insights on the why and how of what she does are icing on this already stunning cake. I loved this book and look forward to her next.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The handsome Mr Grisham is justifiably a star among crime-novel devotees.  This book, however, did not strike me as the equal of his other work. He's usually a master of pace and timing, but this time, he seemed to get mired in the details, wrapped 'round the axle in trying to move the story forward. There was a lot of driving over the countryside, plenty of chatting with friends or suspects and lots of skulking around in secret locations.  But not so much actively developing the story. Don't get me wrong: this is a pretty good read.  But it falls short of what we know Grisham can do.  Meh.
B009E3EWPI|2.0|Was it really worth the wait?<br /><br />Apparently after this concert had finished, Robert Plant (declining the post-gig party of slap-on-the-back sycophants) walked out of the O2 on his own and went down to the local kebab shop. What was he thinking? Well my guess would be that he was hugely disappointed with Jimmy Page's performance in a concert that was at times quite dreadful.<br /><br />I'm as a big a fan of Led Zeppelin as most - owned most of the LPs, played the air guitar in my youth, etc. Not once when I listened to these CDs did I come close to getting my trusty air guitar out of its dusty case.<br /><br />Page's woeful playing is really inexcusable. His timing is all over the place, there are no improvisations, there is no subtlety in his technique, the sound in too shrill and too high in the mix - he sounds more like a drunken busker in the London underground. What has he been doing for the last 20-odd years? Certainly not practicing. More like spending his time being the self-appointed `curator' of the Led Zeppelin legend, fiddling with the legacy recordings.<br /><br />And the other band members? Well, Robert Plant does as well as he could do in the circumstances. His voice obviously doesn't have the range that it once did, but it's a credible performance nonetheless. John Paul Jones plays as the consummate professional musician that he is, but must have been as equally embarrassed as Plant.<br /><br />As for Jason Bonham - he had an impossible mountain to climb to try to copy what his father achieved. Unfortunately his performance was also lacking in timing and finesse. I'm sure a lot of that was down to nerves, but I respect him for having the guts to take part in what must have been a very emotional concert.<br /><br />Robert Plant is absolutely right in refusing to be part of a Led Zeppelin reunion. Why ruin the reputation that this great band has created? Their studio recordings will always stand with the very best in rock history. This one won't- it just gives you an appetite for a dodgy kebab.<br /><br />Jimmy Page - well, he just needs to get out more.

0316212377|2.0|I have been, until now, a huge fan of Iain Banks's Culture novels, to such an extent that I would surf cyberspace every other month for his newest 'episode'.<br /><br />The Hydrogen Sonata was a severe disappointment, so much so that I have not been able to finish it.<br /><br />I loved Excession, Consider Phlebas, Use of Weapons, The Algebraist, Look to Windward, Surface Detail, and Player of Games so much that I re-read them, which is rare for me. But my first inkling that my reading tastes had undergone a quantum change, or that maybe the Culture novels were not that special, was during 'Matter'. At about midway through the book, my reaction was a burgeoning feeling of \\"so what\\"!<br /><br />My reaction to the book under review was worse! Every so often, I would look up from the book to make sure that I had not somehow slipped into an alternate universe where Iain Banks's Culture novels had never existed and the book in my hand was an obscure joke.<br /><br />I hate to say this because I respect the author as an author, but The Hydrogen Sonata is self-indulgent rubbish, where Banks shows off his writing skills at the expense of the story. Did I say story? What story? What dizzying action? Who are the Gzilt? Who are the Inheritors? Who cares?<br /><br />Sad to say, The Hydrogen Sonata,(like Peter Hamilton's Void trilogy)left me cold.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Again I devoured the book and still don't feel satisfied.<br /><br />Now I wonder what will happen next to the characters who have survived the most recent war and how they will react as the next one starts.<br /><br />It seems they will never solve the problems that keep the revolving door spinning
B002PEP4U0|5.0|A most inspiring book. Young people like William are the hope of Africa. Children's version available.<br />Should be in every school library.
B007TXN4TK|2.0|The songs available on the free edition are very limited.  It doesn't teach you how to play the piano, just which keys to hit.  I can play and it was irritating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This a great book to read.  It was full of action and clean romance!  I would recommend it to anybody!
B004Q0R7FG|4.0|My son's favorite Chuggington engine :) Like all the other woodern chuggers, Koko is well made and looks liker her TV counterpart. Very highly recommended!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I wanted to keep reading until I was done. I recommend to anybody!
B004HHKFIY|4.0|My little boy really loves his new trains. This is a quality product for a great price... exactly as advertised! Everything we've gotten in the Chuggington line has been very nice!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved reading this book.  I couldn't put it down.  I wanted to keep reading until I was done. I recommend to anybody!
B004Q0SQ24|4.0|I like the fact that all the individually packaged Chuggers come with their own &#34;trading&#34; card. Wilson also came in one of the starter sets we got our son for Christmas, but I'm keeping the &#34;single&#34; just for the extras.
B0085W6II8|3.0|I've only listened to this twice through, so this is still sinking in. That said, the overall tone of the album is very steady throughout - not much in the way of dynamics that you'd be expecting from this collaboration. I'll still enjoy listening to all of the tracks offered, but maybe not with the enthusiasm that was there before the initial listen.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|I love the app by itself. If you are invested in the Amazon ecosystem, this is a must download. The problem for me is that it is a closed app. I would love to be able to switch my library from Sony, B&N, Kobo to Kindle but with the inability to read unprotected Epub, I must stick with other apps. Amazon, please allow importing of Epubs so I can fully switch over.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My wife had a friend tell her about this game. I thought Temple Run was addictive but this one is just as bad and just as much aggrivating fun. Missions are good and you can buy out of them with the coins you earn to move on as well. GREAT FUN GAME!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I will be anxiously awaiting the final book of this trilogy.  Both my husband and I are hooked.  We highly recommend it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I normally read sci fi and fantasy, but lately I have been trying to expand my horizons. While tis book had a great deal to do with magic, it did not have anything stereotypical. I liked the way the author intertwined the story of the hero and heroine with a third story that you don't truly understand until the end. I couldn't put it down! I would recommend it to anyone looking for something 'different'
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|A lot of interesting stuff, very candid. A little heavy on the religious stuff at the end, but overall I enjoyed the book very much. Interesting that Dave was so determined to beat Metallica, unlike Steven Adler who imploded when he was kicked out of GnR.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a great insight into what a true tragedy war is. So many lives lost because of he egos of just a few.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|This was a fun read. It had a fabulous premise. I really enjoyed this book and intend to read the rest of this series.
B006O6F932|3.0|I rated it 3 star because i felt it cost too much for what it is. I decided to buy one bigger gift instead of several. My granddaughter is 8 and absolutely loved it.
1402736924|5.0|This was perfect for my 7 year old daughter. I would say that the reading level is for the average 3-4 grader.
B008K9SG9K|1.0|just saw this on Conan live....OMG what a corny group!!  its like bubblegum indie rock!  dont bother unless you like super predictable lines and hooks, cheesy guys with dated haircuts,and music that might inspire you to ride off into the sunset on a pink unicorn....
B001BR7CU2|5.0|I never get tired if this movie! It's as fun to watch as it was twenty years ago. Terrific movie!
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|This album is probably the most unique and best work I have heard in all my time listening to metal
B003SNJZ3Y|5.0|One of the greatest books I have read about Hedge Funds legends/stories. Very interesting and entertaining. Anyone interested in the investment world should read it to get an idea of how the HF`s  how managed to short currencies and make literally governments bleed and how they also have managed to profit from losses during the most difficult financial times.
0385342063|5.0|I absolutely loved it. Always laugh out loud funny, so be careful where you read it. People probably think I'm crazy, but Sofie's books make you laugh!
B003UYUP6M|5.0|The best description of how Google was built, how it works, how it has grown and what it means to be a Google employee. Good description of its founders and previous relationship with Steve Jobs and other Silicon Valley titans. Totally recommend it to anyone looking forward to research deeply about Google.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|My husband likes it.  I have not had much time to read it yet but it is very easy to use.
B007MU85D0|4.0|Words like &#34;soaring&#34; and &#34;lush&#34; are a bit of overkill for me, for this music; I have always sought the extraordinary, the unusual but not discordant, and the sense of being taken outside myself--of a kind of sublimation,  in music.  It's tough for any artist to weigh her drive to create and her need for self-expression with the need to pay the bills, and then there's how much one is willing to compromise and produce an output of art that responds to the market.  It's also difficult to have a voice that stands out from the formulaic pop crap out there without being so esoteric that you are your only audience.  I think Of Monsters and Men is pretty much there--but I have been transported  and stripped to bone by a substantial number of artists, thanks to working at finding them (and to being older).  I'll have to live with it for at least a year before I know if it's the type of music that gives you that little moment of inner rejoicing when it comes up on the player; for now I'd say that this album hits about three-quarters of the way up the wow-o-meter, which isn't easy to find.  Enjoyable.
0786955570|5.0|This board game is very nostalgic to me as it harkens to my childhood days when my good friends and I locked ourselves away in secret to play D&D.  Although this game is not exactly like the traditional RPG of my childhood it still has all the elements of what I remembered.  I played through it once with my, at first reluctant, fiancee who had never had the pleasure to experience the old school D&G RPG but after it was all said and done, she had a good time.  This board game is elaborate and well built with excellent and detailed figures.  The replay value is endless due to the fact that it is compatible with other D&D board games for the same maker.  Hopefully soon my friends and I can get together to play the game that made it possible for a bunch of awkward kids to grow up and become good friends.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved the first because it's ability to keep you wondering despite that graphic details. But this book isn't you typical second story, it actually draws you in with its own plot line.
B008DB2Y3O|5.0|I have two copies of this now. I'm a 34 year old mom that won't listen to the radio because of the language and innuendo that's everywhere. My children (ages 9, 7, 4) all love BTR and watch the show religiously. We saw them in concert in July and they were fabulous. Love this CD and we all know every word. Worth every penny.
B005FSI1IK|5.0|If you have not read the Vorkosigan series by Bujold you are missing out on some of the best literature of modern times. Bujold's writing is supurb, her story lines are always interesting and her characterizations wonderful. You do not have to be a Science fiction buff to enjoy the Vorkosigan series as the books contain a mixture of plot lines, ranging from hard military SF, through espionage, political drama, social drama, romance, mystery and comedy, often all within the same book.<br />A Civil campaign is a story of political intrigue, a study in the effects of technology on biology and a regency romantic comedy all rolled into one science fiction book that is a delight to read and re-read.<br />It would be best to at least read Komarr, the previous book in the series, before reading A Civil campaign to get more background, but better still to read the whole series.<br />The are no SF writers that I have found that write as well as Bujold. Her stories are delight ti read.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|Spoiler alert!!<br /><br />I knew he wasn't dead! Kind of unbelievable that Lena didn't think about that. I mean, everyone thought her mom was dead too! Which was obviously another lie!
B008645YEE|5.0|of course there are the obligatory repeats from the other films, but there are a few new pieces that keep it from seeming redundant. i gave this as a gift and the recipient is thrilled and loves it.
1608870081|5.0|My 8 year old son who loves Harry Potter was fascinated by the book.<br />The images are based on the film series, and come alive off the page.<br />Recommended!
B008I3QZKU|5.0|gift recipient was excited and appreciative of receiving this. the only way they can be happier is if i gave them more cd's from the same group.
B00A1EOBJQ|2.0|I'm sorry but the CD failed to meet our expectations and excitement when we heard it.  We love the show and expected more of the vibrant songs to be included and with majority being the top 2 singers which it was not. The CD will go in our stack and not in the car for continual playing.
B000077VR3|4.0|I don't feel my experience was perfect.<br />It arrived on time and was well packaged.<br />I would order again.<br /><br />I really struggle writing reviews using a designated number of rules.
1478230096|5.0|We wanted to read the story before watching the new musical movie &#34;Les Miserables.&#34;  This book was easy to read.  I actually purchased two, and gave the second one as a gift.
1595141715|5.0|this is my daughters book. she read it and loved it . she recommend this book to read .she couldn't put it down
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I loved this movie! Would highly recommend it to others. A great story. Awesome for the family. Will love sharing it with my grandsons.
B008NA3I30|5.0|...you will see a reflection of how complex and hypnotizing human emotions and relationships are. This movie was amazing for me because I think it did a great job of expressing some difficult issues when it comes to love and relationships, as well as life in general. As Sarah Silverman's character says toward the end, \\"life has a gap in it, it just does; you don't go running around like a lunatic trying to fill it.\\" (par.)<br /><br />Michelle Williams' character Margot is happily married...there are no big issues that should threaten their relationship, they don't have serious fights, quite the opposite. They share an understanding and love for each other's quirks that can be easy to take for granted after a couple of years in a relationship. This is why the movie is both brilliant and difficult. The opportunity for an affair when Margot meets Daniel, (Luke Kirby) isn't sexualized in the way a typical mainstream romance might paint it with sexy camera shots highlighting that they are just so turned on she can't help herself. In Take This Waltz, the responsibility for the decision is placed squarely in Margot's lap. This is an overt message, both in directorial touches and Daniel's character. I love that the focus of this movie is Margot's burden of decision and struggle with her desire when there is nothing she can use for an excuse, i.e. relationship problems, boredom, infidelity, potential \\"other man\\" coming on to her strongly. She simply falls in love, as people do, and must make a decision between two men. Finally a movie that doesn't say \\"it's not a big deal that she cheated because she was just swept off her feet and she couldn't help it.\\" blehhhh<br /><br />Anyways, kudos also goes to some brilliant screenwriting by Polley. There are, as other reviewers mention, very hot and evocative scenes, Luke Kirby near breaks my heart in about ten seconds and a single word of script, \\"wow.\\" The script is also hillariously funny. The flirting on the plane is unique and suggestive at the same time of a constant theme relating to an adult's regression to childhood to escape life's \\"big people's\\" decisions. At the heart of this movie are so many universal truths, and I recommend this to anyone willing to open themselves up to some honesty about love in a non-mainstream/pop culture way.<br /><br />Also, I read some reviews that suggest the ending is depressing and unsatisfying...I think this is the POINT. Think about what the theme of the film might be. Why does the ending affect you the way it does? Thank you Sarah Polley! =)
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This is a great book from a different angle that keeps you hanging until the end. Grisham continues to write great books with imagination even after making it to the bigtime.
B0084TWN9K|1.0|I found the stories dreary, dull, and boring except for the last two, which were slightly better.  I could not recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved this. The trilogy was very entertaining, wish there were more in this series to read. I will miss Christian....
B009O07NDY|5.0|What a great soundtrack to go along with a awesome movie. Great music! Howard Shore made another great piece of music and the packaging is really nice as well.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Again, typical Grisham.  Some twists.  His typical good writing.  Very easy to go through.  Had a lot of fun going through it.
B0084I9QIW|5.0|Michael at the height of his career, performing, dancing, singing LIVE for the ENTIRE SHOW, and smiling the whole time! Having had the Yokohama concert, Dangerous, and History shows already, it is great to have this classic now, finally.  Whats great is that if you've seen the later concerts, you can see how Michael continually worked to improve the stage show and performance...always coming bigger and better.  And Michael was probably one of the only artist who, through short films and such, has a specific look and costume associated with every song he does. So on stage, he basically brings the videos to life. Red jacket - Beat It. Blue Shirt/Rope belt - Way U Make Me Feel. 30's Gangster suits - Smooth Criminal. Tuxedo Pants/Glove- you know that one.  But, I still have to say again that the highlight of this show is that he is having incredible fun, smiling, and SINGING the WHOLE THING!  This, coupled with the incredible amount of movement and dancing, is really quite a great feat of strength and skill.  Then after, or before, you watch this show you can look at the tour schedule that comes with the DVD and realize that he would do this every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for a over a year! Incredible! I cannot name one single artist today who could even do that for an hour.<br /><br />Amazing that so many reviews here complain about the video quality.  C'mon, its 1988!  The sound and video are as perfect as it needs to be.  This is classic footage, the likes of which will never be seen again.<br /><br />Long live the King!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I never heard of these guys until \\"Ho Hey\\" so I decided to check them out. All I can say is this album is full of great songs. Expect to hear more in the radio soon. Worth the whole album download.
B00633PFQC|4.0|Professor Sandel tries to push forward one of the most difficult and controversial topics discussed in his 2009 bestseller &#34;Justice&#34;. &#34;What Money Can't Buy&#34; is very well written and an easy reading text with tons of examples showing his main thesis. The main thesis is that sometimes the use of markets cannnot fit the moral exigencies of fairness in trade and degrades the meaning of the commodity that is the trading object. Human organs, citizenship, friendship, and loyalty are some of the &#34;commodities&#34; discussed. The debate on the limits of the market as an institution is an urgent topic to be carried on widely in our contemporary society. I think that the only shortcoming of Sandel's book is its &#34;journalistic tone&#34;. It lacks some of the mpre academic treatment to the subject. But, I think that with the purpose of fermenting an wide discussion, Sandel preferred this popular tone. A must read for students of economics.
B0086449YA|4.0|Even after 35 years Knopfler still has no signs of paucity in his musical approach and virtuosity. Whether it was with Dire Straits, his solo presentations or Soundtracks, Knopfler certainly engulfs you with his expertise in all diversified musical forms. 'Privateering' is a must have for fans who have been enamored with Knopfler's guitar playing and songwriting. You have to give the man kudos for doing a double cd that not only works but allows Knopfler to draw you in to those influences which are Celtic, Country, Blues which diverts beautifully. Knopfler is a brilliant guitarist and he brings all his influences to a panorama of music traditions full throttle. Smart move to have Kim Wilson of the Fabulous T'Birds on board on this album blowing blues harp on several tracks. This is an extremely proficient and intelligent album by an equally important musician who still makes viable contributions.
B005M61PGA|5.0|This is a great cd. I don't like it as much as her previous releases, but its still Katie. She has such a beautiful voice.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book grabbed me right away and was quite a page turner until about the mid way point, where it really dropped off for me. The ending was a complete disappointment.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I have had no problems with this item or the seller
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This show is amazing. What's story line. Can't wait to purchase season 3. Defiantly a show to watch over and over. A true classic  Love all the extras on the DVD.
9707704667|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read! also in great conditions! I got it perfectly packaged and before the date!!
B004HO6I4W|3.0|I have had no problems with this item or the seller, but i thought it had a 3D version included and it was not
B0096BIENY|5.0|This is a great purchase.  The voices blending together for a beautiful and powerful sound.  So pleased with this purchase.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|I have had no problems with this item or the seller
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book! There have only been a hand full of books that have made me want to call off work to finish. This was one of them.
B0092ZEIN4|2.0|I am sad to find that the gamepad I ordered doesn't work right... The joy sticks seem fine until I synced the Playpad to my Asus Transformer and discover that the signal they send are a chaotic mess. It reads that I am holding the joy stick up when I am holding it down. This does the same thing with the other joy stick but in a different direction. I called Nyko for help and they told me to restart my tablet. I didn't fix my problem. The only reason for my 2 star review is because the carrying case is so nice and the little kick stand is cool... But the gamepad it'self doesn't work right.<br /><br />I learned that the app that works with the Playpad is in BETA therefore isn't complete. The gamepad also doesn't work with games that are not specifically supported by NYKO's app. If you add games to their list and configure controls for them they still do not work. Why bother. I feel cheated of my money and want a refund. Sorry to say this but DO NOT BUY.
0756666937|5.0|this is a marvelous book .. it almost resembles an encyclopedia and provides a wealth of information on legos for my<br />grandson who is a legos aficianado... it was exactly what i wanted for his Christmas gift... excellent shipping service.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|Very easy to us.  Had my daughter set it up for me.  Purchases go thru very easy and quick.  Recommend to all
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love it!! It is so much fun. If you try it you'll love it as much as I do. I. Even have a bunch of my friends playing it
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first book. I liked the second book . I am disappointed in the way this book started and ended. I expected a little more character maturity from Katniss. I can only assume the author wanted to get her point across about the horrors of war and what it does to us.  I just expected Katniss to rise above it all.  Good reading though I just didn't like how it ended.
B009329ZF2|5.0|awesome movie! The story, graphics, actors were all fantastic. I really liked it. and the price and service that i used to rent this move are awesome aswell
B00338QENI|4.0|I truly admire the author but I did find the jumping around timeline a little daunting at times. I appreciate that reflects how history is discovered from different sources and only with skill is the story told.  Ms Skloot is truly to be congratulated on her ability and certainly her persistence.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love it best book ever I just could not put the book down can't wait to read the next two
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|large numbers make it easy to use and easy to read.  comes in handy when you need a calculator. works well.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book, very engaging. Would have liked a different ending though. Justice needed to served to Amy or Nick should have actually killed her.
0756655307|5.0|Awesome! My son is 8 and loves everything Marvel and DC (we got the DC encyclopedia too). He can't take his eyes off these books, learning about all the characters!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I really loved photo editor plus. it ROCKS. I like that you get so many different effects for free. I love that I can cropy pictures, blur any blemishes and use the meme effects
B007TXN4TK|1.0|I chose this because my daughter plays piano. But as with many things, the trials are free or only parts, and as you really get more into it, you find out it's not really free.<br />Don't say it's free, if it really isn't.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This story is VERY WONDERful!! It really touched my heart and others too! I very highly recommend this book! READ THIS NOW!
B00009RDGA|5.0|I've always loved this movie for many obvious reasons (great script, director, & actors), but there are other reasons I love this movie that I could never express.  Maybe it was because I didn't know what goes into making a movie.  But after listening to Peter Bogdanovich's commentary, it all became clear.  It's like appreciating a great piece of music by Mozart but not knowing why the work had such a great effect on me.  I believe this movie is truly one of Bogdanovich's masterworks.  And I wish it would come out on blu-ray.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love it....except for the ads. But, for free, will put up with the ads. Would definitely recommend to other friends and family.
B005LAII12|5.0|Awesome movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone without young children. Definetely exactly what I expected from the creator of Family Guy.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great for 'writing down' reminders, notes or lists. Like the feature of using colors for different notes. Would definitely recomment to others.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was in love with 50 shades! But this book took it to a who New level!! I would recommend this to anyone!
1451695187|5.0|I enjoyed PROOF OF HEAVEN very much. Its descriptions and conclusions jibed with those of my own lifelong spiritual journey, and I found the book to be thought-provoking and reassuring. I also admired its well crafted prose -- clear, simple and direct, and therefore the more persuasive.
B0000UJL96|4.0|One of my favorite original Star Trek movies. I am a Star Trek fan and must say I still think this is one of William Shatner's best movies. I'm thinking about ordering Star Trek Generations next. I'm not to big on the new Star Trek movie since when I watched it I was missing my old cast, although Spock was in it. Overall a very decent original classic of Star Trek.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|This series has it all, great acting, suspense -a truly special first season!  Looking forward to the 2nd season and beyond!
B005KJZDXK|5.0|Zooey Dechanel released this album before &#34;New Girl&#34; aired, though that makes no difference except I'm tickled to see her depth of talent being well used. The songs on the Christmas cut are timeless, classic, and quirky, just like her.
B000003CUJ|3.0|I suppose one can view this disc as serving one of two related purposes. One is the provide the listener with orchestral excerpts from Wagner's operatic Ring cycle. The other is to put those excerpts in chronological order in order to give a musical sketch of the dramas' great story arc. Well, despite some modest success at times, neither supposed endeavor fully works. For some selections -- and for many as a group -- there are better renditions out there: My own personal chioces are for the vintage and venerable recordings conducted by Otto Klemperer on the EMI label and Solti's Wagner collection on London/Decca. Of course, those compilations go beyond the Ring itself, but what they do offer of the four operas is in both cases better performed than these renditions directed by Maazel, at least in my opinion. That leaves us with the goal of briefly telling the Ring story in voiceless music, a goal that on the surface would seem difficult if not impossible within the confines of a single disc. Maazel and the Berlin Philharmonic do not embarrtass themselves in the attempt, and they actually do a pretty good job in many places, but as other reviewers have pointed out there are serious omissions as well as awkward or nonexistent transitions. Still, for what it is -- 70 minutes of music yanked from four massive operas -- the ride is okay and one I don't mind taking now and then. So if shaving off a few pieces of skin without having to chew the whole carcass is your preference, this album will probably work for you well enough.
1401322786|5.0|I needed a great evening reading literature, and this came highly recommended.<br /><br />Easy to read short chapter.<br />Great story that draws you in the second you pick it up.<br />It's one of those books you just want to get to the ending.<br />While at the same time it teachers a great story about the value of your like and what you do with your time.
0312430000|5.0|This book is worth reading for health care professionals, systems thinkers, CQI professionals, health policy experts, politicians, and the general public.  It is a popular book rather than scholarly.  It is easy to read, but is not designed as a reference.  It contains little literature review or peer-reviewed research.<br /><br />There are some data surveys and references, pertinent personal experiences and informed opinions.  It integrates well with the concepts and observations in Makary, M., &#34;Unaccountable.&#34;  Dr. Gawande is a surgeon.  That makes the book credible.  Yet, that trades on the culture he and Dr. Gawande (also a surgeon) identify as problematic; the physician as &#34;hero&#34;/ &#34;master craftsman&#34;/ &#34;leader&#34; of health care.  Had this been written by a registered nurse, health policy specialist or systems analyst, it would be belittled and ignored.<br /><br />Dr. Gawande's observes that while other complex systems such as aircraft flying and building have moved to teams and mandatory communication, medicine and health care remain in the 19th century.  Dr. Makary observes that is a product of physican enculturation and the self-interest of the institutions - primarily hospitals - in which they work.<br /><br />The data transparency and incentives changes which Dr. Makary advocates must be combined with Dr. Gawande's team concepts to fix a very broken health care system.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not one to read romances, but I needed to know what all the buzz was about... I was extremely surprised to find myself drawn into this story so quickly. Before I knew it I'd purchased the entire trilogy and I have no regrets. I ADORE THIS BOOK!!!!
B000MGATTE|3.0|The story held my interest, but I found its use of its own special vocabulary off-putting.  I also found its central male character to be a King variant, and he was much too heroic for my taste. Still, as I suggested initially, I CARED about these characters, especially Lisey.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Iloved the book.  Good mystery,  It kept me in suspese.  The characters were interesting and I wanted to find out what happened.  I loved the ending.  A good suspense and romantic novel.
B00908DDZM|5.0|The lyrics are smart and it is cool to hear something that is not mysogynist and homophobic.  It is really the whole package: sharp lyrics, well assembled vocals and jazzy riffs.  These are the kind of tunes you can't stop humming all day.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|this is such a great app it has everyone I know laughing about it it keeps us entertained for many hours even the kids love it too thank you so much for this app it is a wonderful app

0307454568|5.0|This is the third and final book in the Millenium series, and it takes place just after the events of the second book. With Lisbeth in the hospital, recovering from a gunshot wound to the head, she is startled to find that her father in the same ward of the hospital. Fearing for her life, but under guard and incredibly weakened from her injuries, she tries to come up with ways to protect herself. Blomqvist continues to dig deeper into the story, trying to find out who is behind the murders Lisbeth is accused of and the deeper conspiracy. What he finds is a secret organization deep within the country's national security organization. He must use his wits and join forces with Lisbeth's friends to bring the guilty to justice, exonerate Lisbeth and keep her alive. A shocking attack on the hospital draws them deeper into the secret world. While Lisbeth is somewhat limited in her abilities, she works in her own way to find answers. There are several side stories with drama at the Millenium magazine and its members as they try to put together a blockbuster issue and accompanying book, as well as threats both open and electronically against one of their own. The series comes to gripping conclusion, showing the dark underbelly of a sect of a government organization that has gone rogue. I enjoyed the novel, but missed having Lisbeth as the primary focus. Nonetheless, it was a satisfying end to the series.

0545259096|5.0|As a werewolf fan, I absolutely loved this book. Now, bear in mind that these books came out when werewolves weren't all that popular. These werewolves aren't at all like the ones you read now-a-days. Being a werewolf is a disease. It's something people can't control--you turn when it's cold, period. I love this. It's such a good change from the werewolves that are so popular right now and also makes werewolf-ism the \\"bad guy\\" in these stories.<br />Like the previous two books, the point of views switch between Sam and Grace, but also Isabel and Cole. I really like this because we get to see how everyone is and why they do the things that they do. We understand the characters better--and in turn connect with them better.<br />Sam (God, I love him) and Grace are trying to figure out how to be together. They had it all \\"fixed.\\" After all, Sam was cured, wasn't he? They were finally supposed to be together. But no, the werewolf disease intervened yet again. Cole had to bite Grace so she could turn into a wolf--otherwise she would've died. Sam is left alone as a human and Grace's absentee parents are accusing him of kidnapping Grace.<br />Isabel and Cole start learning how to be better people in this book, which makes me happy. I kinda liked Isabel in the second book, so here it's nice that we really get to see what's going on inside her head and how she's maturing. Now Cole I really didn't like when Stiefvater first introduced him, but here we get to know why he is how he is and I like him a lot more.<br />There was this huge incident that made me bawl my eyes out close to the end and I both curse and bless Stiefvater for it. To keep this review spoiler-free I can't put it on here, but it was so GOOD.<br />What was slightly disappointing yet also a very good thing was that this book didn't have an everything's-fine-and-dandy-and-there's-happiness-and-rainbows-everywhere ending. It was realistic. The disease wasn't definitely cured; Sam and Grace still have a lot of hoops to jump through, but things are looking up. The ending was sweet and made my heart melt.<br />Stiefvater has said that there will not be any more books to the series because they ended the way they were supposed to end.<br />I get that.<br />I really do. I liked the ending; I felt satisfied with it. It's an \\"open ending,\\" like Stiefvater calls it.<br />Does that mean I don't want there to be another story? Heck no! But I understand why it ended the way it did and I'm happy with it.<br />Also, I can always re-read the trilogy ;)ps to jump through, but things are looking up.

B00AFEXRME|1.0|I saw this in the theater - and I know Denzel has done some wonderful acting - and it was Not in this movie. I understand the dynamics of addiction and recovery. There is no need for the nudity and language in any movie. The creators of this movie take the charactor's bottoming out with alcohol and drugs beyond the point of disgust. And if you really want to ruin a moive - just add John Goodman to the mix. The only redeeming part - was the clever 'plane roll-over' which was right in the movie trailer. Shame on the creator, director and Denzel taking an inspiring story - and making even this charactor's 'recovery' sickening too. A very bleak story - and a sad comment on our society - that we promote such language and behavior in our current movies!! The art and tact of implied - subtle story information - is near dead. Sincerely, Scott MacNeil

0486474917|5.0|Adventures of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has some very intriguing stories with few stories that bore. The edition I read was specially created in 1994 for  the Book-of-the-Month Club and was published in the United States. The stories are written in the perspective of Dr. Watson who is Holmes' friend and colleague. Watson is a rather beginner detective and is often left in the dark until their is some dangerous things going on. Unlike many detectives, Holmes, a private detective, does not go searching for more evidence often. Most of the times he listens to the clues and in a supernatural-like way puts the clues together and then determines the possible outcomes.<br /> Recently I have noticed that all the good tv shows are violent. I do not know if this is because the best actors are acting in violent shows or if it is just my opinion. I know some other people share this same opinion. I feel the same way about this book as I do about many short stories. The short stories in this book that do not involve any crime put me to sleep. Who cares about somebody's lost wife? Why should I find that interesting? The crimes that involve serious crimes like killing or kidnapping or even the stories that appear to have a killing and then it turns out their was no death interest me a lot more. For example, the adventure of the speckled band where the murder weapon was weird I thought was much more exciting than a case of identity where someone changes the way they look so they can beg for money.<br /> I am glad Sir Arthur Conan Doyle decided to write the book in the perspective of Dr. Watson instead of Holmes himself. The stories are more interesting and suspenseful. Holmes is trying to train Watson to be a better detective so Holmes often does not tell him his opinion of the matter because he wants Watson to think of the conclusions. In at least one of the stories Holmes' predicted conclusion was wrong and that created even more excitement because neither of themknew what to do. Many movies make Watson look like a fool which is just the opposite. Holmes may make Watson look a like a fool in movies, but by reading the series, you learn Watson is a very intelligent man.<br /> Sherlock Holmes is very good as solving problems. Throughout the stories he solves interesting allegories that almost no one could solve. For example, in \\"The Adventure of the Speckled Band\\" one of the women who dies scream out it was \\"the speckled band.\\" This allegory Holmes learned, does not relate to who killed her, it relates to what killed her. Holmes being a very smart detective is able to solve `unsolvable' problems.<br /> Often Dr. Watson does not know what is happening and is often left in danger because of this. The majority of these stories tend to involve crime, but the ones that do not are as interesting. If the Sherlock Holmes series was written in Holmes' point of view, the story would not be as unpredictable. Holmes throughout the stories solves allegories that nobody else would be able to solve. I would recommend this book because the stories are suspenseful and involve two very smart interesting men that lock you out from the rest of the world.

A woman walks days to give her child to an orphanage.  One Mother educated and a doctor, and one a poor villager who moves to the city for a better life.  Both loving the same daughter one in person and one in spirit.  Then their is the daughter who wants to know her Fathers Indian family and goes off to find her birth parents.  Each chapter follows one side of the world.  I enjoyed this book from beginning to end.  It was fascinating to learn about India and to see the love and support of a Mother in the US.  Great story and I hope the authors writes many more wonderful stories.

0307887960|5.0|I started the diet in Sept after a Dr appmt, I wanted my hormones checked cause I eat healthy and exercise regularly but couldn't shed some unwanted pounds. My Dr recommend this diet as she was on it.<br /><br />I read lots of reviews before I started, I was shocked at how fast the weight came off, not only that but it stayed off even when I resumed my normal eating, I did gain a few back over the christmas holidays but that's because we went away and I had many drinks and ate like I was going to the electric chair. Even with the way I ate over the holidays, I only gained 4 lbs.<br /><br />I like the ease of toggling beteween phases. Example I started in Sept 2012 and by Dec 2012, I was at my goal weight and down 18lbs.  I went on attack phase for a week on my return from vacation and lost the 5lbs I gained.  Now I'm back on consolidation.<br /><br />The diet really works! I am extremely pleased, many people compliment me daily and ask how I did it, I sent them the book information and links and now many people at my company are on this diet.<br /><br />Good luck to those now starting the diet, you will see fast results that can be easily maintained.

0345803493|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  This second book in the series begins at the end of the previous books cliffhanger. The characters continue on their journey as he realizes just how much he wants to change his old habits. She in turn rediscovers herself and reaffirms her career plan that she had before meeting him. They each learn that there has to be give and take in a healthy relationship. So they each work toward meeting the needs of each other.

Only song I'm not a fan of is \\"Bad Boy\\", just not my thing. Otherwise, I'm very impressed and glad I bought it. If you've liked their other albums, you're sure to enjoy this one too.
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  It is not a story about eroticism specifically. Nor is it sourly a love story. Yet both of these things are prominent. In short it is a story about a man who appears to have everything he could want and is equally well adjusted, when in reality he is both missing the things he needs most and is about as psychologically cut off from others as he can be. He convinces himself that he is happy, but as he gets to know Her his house of sturdy cards starts to crumble. Soon he realizes that she is the only anchor he needs and wants. As he accepts that he starts to heal. And in turn she learns how deeply she loves this erotic, attentive, damaged man and neither wants nor can stop falling deeper in love with him.
0765325950|4.0|An audiobook review:<br /><br />\\"Loial son of Arent son of Halen, had secretly always wanted to be hasty.\\"  ~AMoL<br /><br />As a hasty human, I listened to this book almost non-stop, narrator on 2X (3X for the slow parts) so that I could get to the end.  Waiting almost 2 decades for Tarmon Gai'don made me impatient.  I'll certainly listen to it again, this time on normal speed, but wanted to jot down a few things in a spoiler-free review for my fellow impatient humans before I start over and savor it more slowly.<br /><br />I feel that I should warn people that A Memory of Light is one of the most exhausting books I've ever read.  Half-way through and I was already battle weary.  Three quarters through and I felt that the whole thing was hopeless.  None of the preceding books have come close to approaching the intensity of this final volume.  It truly felt like the end of all things.  It was glorious.  It was heartbreaking.  It was so many things but, like most WoT books, it wasn't perfect.<br /><br />First, a few of the good things.  There are so many surprises that I never felt that I could anticipate what was going to happen next.  Many threads are tied up, most in a satisfactory manner.  Talmanes gets more screen time (I've always loved Talmanes).  You really get the feeling that the entire world is at war, and it's done in a way that is believable.<br /><br />The Pevara and Androl storyline almost stole the show.  I just couldn't get enough of them.  I'd love to see a follow-up short story about these two in a fantasy anthology like the Legends series.<br /><br />Good people die.  GASP!  Oh yes, while Team Jordan doesn't exactly go about it George R.R. Martin-style, they definitely make up for lost time in weeding down the character list.  Some of the deaths are meaningless, some are tide-turners and not all of them were as touching as they could have been.  The death of a few of my favorite characters left me feeling oddly detached, while the death of another character had me bawling more than I did for Dumbledore.<br /><br />Now for the not so good.  There are a few deus ex machina contrivances that grated on me, but the worst was about Perrin.  Perrin's special abilities have never been particularly spectacular and it really feels like they got amped up so that he wouldn't be overshadowed by the other two ta'veren boys.  I've never been a huge fan of Perrin's storyline once he married Faile, so maybe it's just me.<br /><br />Mat, one of my favorite characters, has deteriorated into not much more than a clown.  I didn't mind his comic relief bits so much in the last two novels, but he's a pivotal character in this novel and has become almost a parody of Mat.<br /><br />Everything Padan Fain.  Sad waste of a potentially great villain.  I really haven't cared about him since he left the Whitecloaks and here it almost seemed like he was thrown in as an afterthought.  I wish they would have just left him out of it.  Terrible.<br /><br />Another reviewer stated that some of the accents for characters have changed, and I have to agree.  I've just spent 3 months listening to the 14 previous books and there are several minor differences in the `voice' of some characters in this final novel.  It was mildly distracting in the beginning, but nowhere near as the egregious differences in Roy Dotrice's erratic narrations of the first/last Song of Ice and Fire novels.<br /><br />Unlike Tolkein's Return of the King, which had way too much 'after' focus(in my opinion), here hardly get any wrap up.  If I had to summarize the flow of the novel, it goes something like this, maneuver, maneuver, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, reposition your troops, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, end.  Sure, it's Tarmon Gai'don, but I guess I'm one of those people that prefer a bit more exposition about what happens afterward.  These are our friends, some of whom we know better than our own family members, and I would have preferred to know more about what happens to them when the dust settles as we've been assured that there won't be any sequels or prequels.<br /><br />As far as my rating, I take away ½ star for pacing, ½ star for annoying plot devices, ½ star for missed opportunities, which leaves 3 ½ stars.  I'll round that up to 4 because, though it often infuriates me, The Wheel of Time is an old friend and I love it despite it's flaws.ily members, and I would have preferred to know more about what happens to them when the dust settles as we've been assured that there won't be any sequels or prequels.<br /><br />As far as my rating, I take away ½ star for pacing, ½ star for annoying plot devices, ½ star for missed opportunities, which leaves 3 ½ stars.

0345803507|5.0|As if you thought there was nothing further that could tear these two apart things start to unravel and twist. They still hang on for dear life to the relationship that neither can survive without, but obstacles always have to happen in life. Unexpected plans arise. And an almost soap opera like problem threatens. But the story still finds a healthy and satisfying conclusion. Can't wait to read the whole series again!!

The story, especially for those old enough to remember that time frame, is compelling and the characters fascinating.  The first section was a little tough for some people to get through, but it's worth slogging through the first bit until it begins to come clear how it all hangs together by unexpected cords that prove as strong as a tightrope walker's cords.

While reading the Apricot Crisp recipe, I was wondering how I could convert it to apples. I turned the page, and there, lo and behold, are suggestions on how to convert to different fruits, including apples! Hooray for a cookbook author thinking ahead! Not all the recipes are the easiest, but so far they have all been quite tasty. My family has given rave reviews of the peanut butter sandwich cookies and her version of rice krispies treats. They. Are. Awesome. (says my 9 and 13 year old sons). And they were. Also gone in less than a day. I'm looking forward to trying even more recipes.
B000JIJPZY|5.0|Simple, nice sized, and not hard at all to put together. I received this two days after ordering, far before the delivery date! Bought as a Christmas present for my four month old brother and he absolutely loves it! He is just filled with smiles and giggles :) it's a pleasant interactive toy
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an amazing book! A very romantic book that any one would love!! Definitely recommend it for everyone lol :)
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I'm a World War 2 buff and like underdog groups that get back at the Enemy. If you like action and want too see Nazi's get their butts kicked,this is the film.
B004GVUPFE|5.0|Great app for keeping your brain challenged.  This works great with the kids when they are bored. It keeps them busy and challenged.
B00APUQH0W|5.0|Another Clint Eastwood classic. An old timer baseball scout that knows stats don't mean everything. I would recommend this film to others.
B0096DFBZQ|5.0|Everybody loves pac-man. All three of my kids enjoy playing this app. It is one for all ages. Great to see him back.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover knows how to keep her audience reading! I was hooked from the first page to the end of the book!  Could not put it down. Highly recommend this book for those interested in reading about romance!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My 8 year old daughter loves music. She loves playing this app and memorizes the pattern.  She had so much fun with it I tried it and loved it.  Although my memory isn't as sharp as hers.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you like dark and twisty like I do, prepare to turn onto a pretzel!  Jessica Lange is perfection! Must see!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|My husband really likes the 3D effect on movies and with Avatar is just made it seem more lifelike and you were there.  Great job and hope to see more of them.
0425152251|4.0|I first read this book last year in graduate school when our Social Studies methods teacher referenced it. I found it to be engaging and informative, but also written at a level that would appeal to high school students studying philosophy. Not too heady and weird!
B0018RWMNM|5.0|Great film! A true classic. My husband was thrilled to get this for Christmas, along with his new blue ray player.
076790592X|5.0|I have read this book more than once, and it gets to me every time! The main lessons I always learn are to be interested in life and care for people. By the time I finished the book, I felt like I knew Morrie personally and was sad to see him go.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|A staple of Holiday Tradition. A must see! Chevy Chase is fantastic - the sled scene is the greatest. A joyous romp for the whole family!
B0093FNZT6|5.0|Whatever your beliefs about an afterlife may be you owe it to yourself to read this book.  One of the very few books I just couldn't put down.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B000NIVJGI|5.0|What can one say about Dirty Dancing? It's a classic 80's flick - and has a great soundtrack. If you're not aware... No body puts Baby in the corner!
B009T3AHDE|5.0|This movie was so much better than what i expected when i read the critics reviews. I recommend it to anyone who wants a movie that really makes you think .the acting was amazing .Robert Pattinson was totally amazing in it .He should of been nominated for an oscar for his portrayal of Eric Parker the billonaire. A great indie film.
0061733199|5.0|I got this book for my brother for Christmas. He is an avid back packer and loves hiking. We call him &#34;the mailman&#34; because he's hiked in the hot desert for weeks, snow, sleet, hail, you name it. He did not need more camping gear so I thought this book would be nice. I would read it myself! It has color pictures and diagrams, it feels like laminated paper and is very thorough. It covers basic to advanced fire building skills, various edible plants, types of birds and knot tying. He has not found anything that is not covered in this book. If you feel like you would die in the wilderness if you got lost, you should read this.
B008BU70HW|5.0|I liked this book because of the individual background on each character. It presents interesting historical and cultural background that will enhance the viewer's understanding and enjoyment of the world of high English society. Plus it's fun!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|This movie is too confusing.  Didn't like the plot at all.  The characters blended in together, and good guys and bad guys all looked alike.
B004G600A4|5.0|This came in perfect condition and we were really excited to get it!<br />It is always fun to get new movies that are cheap.
0762445262|4.0|My teen loves his bat signal.<br />Works great. Lights up and projects well.<br />Thanks so much. Very happy & would recommend .
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Their music is fantastic and I felt that this was a very reasonably price.  It came earlier than expected but that is a good thing.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I have read other near death experience books but this one is compelling. His experience seems different than most.  I enjoyed the perspective of this neurosurgeon being able to tear down medical myths about NDE's.  Some of it was a difficult read because of the medical terminology but if you can get through that the core message comes through..
B005LAII0I|5.0|It was a little beat up but that didn't bother us, it came in good time and it is a really good show.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Sure, its a tired story of the underdog facing the champs, but this movie was really fun to watch.  It was funny, had a great cast of people, and the singing was great.  It's like \\"Bring it on\\" and \\"Glee\\".  There were quite a few one-liners slipped in there that my wife and I kept repeating to each other later.  We found it to be a really good movie. Oscar winner?  No. Fun? Yes.  Very worth the rental...well, an SD rental anyway :)
B004SMD4H2|1.0|Jus  didnt really like the show  ..friend had  told me about  it n i gave  it a shot...watched  all  the firsdt disc..and that wuz  enough for me to  know i didnt  care for it
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Not the best Lee Child but a good read over the holidays. My first e book as a trial which worked well
B009UX2YAC|5.0|my young son  loves this game!  he loves the special powers that you acquire during the course of the run.
1926778537|5.0|This is a true glimpse into game development. This is not one of those marketing art books like many other studios stamp out.<br /><br />Its huge. Its wonderfully detailed. Its packed with art.<br /><br />The quality is superb (unlike ballistic softcovers), but some of the fine details like the tiny scribbles of the artists are sometimes hard to make out.<br /><br />If your a fan of the series, enjoy top quality concept art and modeling, or in gamedev - get this book now.
B008JF8O9M|2.0|I had great hopes for this app since it's the only free printing app for Kindle Fire... Unfortunately, it didn't work<br />because there's some kind of bug where Kindle browser Silk doesn't actually bring the url content down to the device.<br />So I end up with a printer app that doesn't print the most important browsing things that I do.
B000GX8B9I|5.0|It was an amazing movie. I really enjoyed seeing the bravery and courage of our soldiers. I think our military personnel need to be thanked more for their struggles on our behalf.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|You know what you're getting into by watching this: An action packed film that doesn't take itself too seriously.  That's what I was looking for and it delivered 100%.  If that doesn't appeal to you go call your boyfriend and dust off that copy of Steel Magnolias to watch while holding hands.
B005H0CBZ0|5.0|Hi these books do not get boring and i would recommend them to any one as the story line is great
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I like the view and ease of using the app on my kindle fire!  I highly recommend it.  I use it every day.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I would  recommend this  book to readers who like to read suspends romance an  mystery at the same time. From the rising  actions to the resolutions, this book will keep you at the edge of your seat! This is definitely a must read!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|My love affair with McEwan has waned. First drawn in by Atonement, I haven't yet found a worthy equal.  Maybe I'm looking for a successor to the spy novels of LeCarre?  No way, here.  Or, maybe the reality of contemporary life just simply doesn't allow for any personal heroism.  Still, I recommend Sweet Tooth with reservation---it presents a picture of a somewhat tawdry scene.  I found that I didn't really care who betrayed whom. Maybe that was the author's intent.
0312430000|5.0|Attended the Big (D)esign conference in Dallas, and a smart presenter gave a whole talk on the usefulness of checklists. This was her secret weapon - this book. And even though it's not about web design, it's an eye-opener for sure.<br /><br />I got a lot out of her talk, but even more out of this book. I've been making checklists ever since. For software development, for website projects, packing and travel prep lists, even a quick mental cycling checklist for myself so I don't forget WASH (w)ater, (a)ir, (s)ound (phone) and (h)elmet.<br /><br />It's so tempting to think we'll remember. As someone who's on the downslope of aging, let me tell you - checklists are awesome.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you like temple run then you'll love this. it fun and exciting challenges every day. its a 5 star
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Loved the movie and the 3D is awesome.  The service and price of ordering this product was great.  I wil use them again
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I am having a hard time putting down The Night Circus.<br />The characters each have a role in the circus and you hear about their participation in the circus, either as a performer or as a visitor. The story weaves back and forth between the characters and as the book progresses you find out how each character 'helps' the others in the book.
B004LWZW7E|5.0|This movie is so relevant.  It uses time the way we use money today.  It sends a great sociological message.  This movie should make you think about money gives people  advantages and opportunities. It also shows how the lack of money is life treatening.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Once you start, once you dive in. It's impossible to put down. It takes you to a whole new world, changes how you see the world.
B00005JLEX|4.0|I have all of all the DVD sets covering all 9 seasons of Seinfeld. So, being a fan, I have to have them all, but be sure that there is a qualitative difference starting with Season 3 - when the show started to really hit its stride. It is interesting to see these first 2 seasons, because they do come across as very different and a little slow as compared to the subsequent seasons. The characters are still forming and finding themselves. Season One - is a very brief season indeed - not a full slate of shows for a typical TV season, and I never knew why until I bought these box sets. You can find out why also when you buy them, because they are packed with extras and behind the scenes interviews and mini-docs that go into great detail about the origins of the show and its evolution. That stuff there is a true bonus as it is as interesting and fun to watch - for me anyway - as the show itself. A bargain at the current price.
0425263908|5.0|I love this book. it has its similarities to 50 shades of grey and still was so hooked i needed more. bared to you and the crossfire series is now my guilty pleasure and cant wait to read the third book... since i have already read book books in two days.
B0000DC13U|3.0|I am the Stones Authority. The value of this film increases with time. It must have been a real pain in the neck to watch at the time (anytime actually), but today it is a wonderful document of a band building a song. In this case the band is the Rolling Stones - no slouches - and the song is \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\", a popular favorite. Rather, one of their all time iconic and identifiable hits. This is documentary in its purest form, which is not necessarily a compliment. Long static shots that let the players in the frame slowly do whatever it is they ultimately do - or in some cases, not do - occasionally mixed with some odd avant garde French socialist revolutionary nonsense (redundant, I know). But if you ever daydreamed about what it would be like to sit around and watch your guitar heroes in a recording session, well, now you too can do it, for the low, low price of....  Anyway, I have sat in on recording sessions and there is nothing quite as dull, in fact watching paint dry is a step up, but here we are looking back in time more than 40 years as of the writing of this review. We have here another valuable time capsule and document of an important band working in the Sixties, as well as capturing some of the other social under currents of the time. Don't watch this movie with the idea of being entertained, watch it like you would an experiment in Psych Class or Recording 101. This is also an important film for the fact that it captures Brian Jones on film - well, the back of his head mostly. Sometimes he is captured looking quite good, but other times... Then towards the end of the film we don't see him at all. And that should tell us all something too. There has long been a debate - sometimes quite hot in the Seventies and Eighties - about how guilty Mick and Keith are for Brian's demise. For me, anyway, when I saw this years ago it erased any doubt in my mind that the accounts that Mick and Keith gave regarding Brian's descent into the abyss were largelyaccurate. The other thing that comes across in the film is just how good and comfortable a guitarist Keith Richards is. His casual phrasing and fills are a wonder to behold for any aspiring guitar hero, or anyone frustrated in their attempts to become one. The other thing that is interesting are the fleeting glimpses of those long associated with the Stones seen there in the studio. Ian Stewart and Nicky Hopkins. Marianne Faithful and Anita Pallenberg doing backing vocals with the guys, and others milling about. At one point we even see Anita whisper something into Keith's ear, wonder what it was? I wonder what Brian thought? Anyway, if you are a fan of the Stones, or a fan of the era - or God forbid, a fan of the stupid social political commentary, or simply a fan of watching a recording session and paint dry, then by all means you should get this movie. You will love it.
0425263916|5.0|All types of wonderful. Love this book and cant wait till the next one comes out in a few months.
B00014TJ7K|3.0|There are a handful of good songs here, but most of it is what I would deem typical George. Hey, I love George and the Beatles, but he was appropriately relegated to 1 or 2 tracks per album, because his songs generally don't measure up. Yes, there are many great exceptions to my generalization, but this album isn't one of them. The song &#34;When We Was Fab&#34; is an exception. I always get kind of choked up on that one, but apart from that track and &#34;Got My Mind Set On You&#34; the rest of the album is decidedly 3 Star stuff. Hey, if you can pick it up for cheap then I would. I did.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|This was good but it was short. The graphics were great and the puzzles were good but just disappointed for the price the game did not take long to play.
B00A757EFW|4.0|This was fun to play, however the absence of a joystick makes movement somewhat delayed in moving the pac man around
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is the 3rd book by Jodi Picout that I have read and loved! Looking forward to the next one!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting.  Kinda scary. With the earthworm scene I am not sure how I feel about that.  I also think that God should be called God not om.  Give God glory. But then again we have to remember he is a new believer.  Good book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|who in the hell likes this book?!?! it is boring, unrealistic and unsexy. please...the disclaimer should read &#34;for those with absolutely no sexlife&#34;
B0000025D0|5.0|Very Good Album and a must have. Every song is an expression and a treasure. The songs tell a story and describe a period in time that can still be felt today.
0525953728|2.0|Frankly, I wish I had not purchased this book. I found myself flipping the Kindle next page switch looking for the interesting parts, which were few because the book was written and released in a rush to publish. Fox News viewers will probably like the book more than I did. I resented the author's rude, snarky comments about meeting the Commander in Chief and the Vice President. Did he really have to compare Biden to the drunk uncle at the Christmas dinner? I thought his diversion into politics cheapened what should have been a classy, non-political book about one of the great news stories of the century.
B005LHOKFS|4.0|Connects easily<br />Easy download from the App store<br />Lets us do what we want on Trip Advisor<br />Would recommend it
B006LSZECO|5.0|The first half of the book was REALLY good.  It was a book I knew I wanted to keep reading, but it was not one that I felt I could not get away from.  However, the second part of the book had so much action/suspense that I could not wait to keep reading.  I felt that the ending was more of a fizzle than a bang.  That being said, it did not feel inappropriate.  I still highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good, suspenseful, read!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Absolutely no complaints here whatsoever.  Only recommendation is that you make sure that you're out of the settings before you turn your Fire HD off for the night, otherwise the alarm won't go off.
1419707671|5.0|I got this set plus a couple of other Wimpy Kid books as a Christmas gift to my daughter. My 8 year old daughter loves these. She was overjoyed to see that she now has the completed set of the Wimpy Kid Diaries and reads them daily. I would recommend to anyone who's kid likes to read. They will really enjoy these.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|No complaints whatsoever with this app; only thing I would make sure that purchasers note is that if you're playing this on your Fire HD and you hit &#34;Home&#34; while paused or on the middle of the level, it might get stuck on the adds when you try to come back.  It's an easy fix...just restart the tablet.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This is great information on the go!  I don't have a fancy phone so this is great to have with me in the Kindle to help plan the day!
B008476HBM|5.0|I think this a great book. I have probably read this book 3 times. Just everyone says, &#34;It is a classic.&#34;
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Again, easy way to stay connected if you don't have access to your computer or you don't have a high-tech phone.  It seems a little hard to follow but I haven't really played with it yet
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoovers book is a must read. Was great from start to finish. Only sorry it had to end. will definitely visit thi again.
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|This book is so realistically written its hard to believe that this is a fictional novel. I have been so impressed by Maggie's imagery and research for this series that I'm pretty sure I will be buying all of her books and reading them just to get more of her creativity and mind boggling talent to connect with a reader she never knew. When reading these books, it's very hard to think of anything else in the day. Worth all the time in the world.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The blue ray really is fantastic. They took something like 5 years to get this movie out, and out was well worth the wait.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I ended up changing browser to stay on web view. which disinterest because things are very small. requiring constant resizing.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|very entertaining game. The best free game I have played. Would be better if it had more levels. Would recommend this game to anyone.
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|My son's face lit up when he unwrapped this.  He plays with it (and the other gups) all the time and it is holding up well.  I just wish these were sold in the US so I wouldn't have to take out a loan to buy them.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an amazing reading experience. This book has lots of detail as if it were the movie. It is a visual book that allows you to dive into Suzanne Collins amazing skill of writing, she should become the most loved, praised,and read author there is .I give this book five stars hands down no doubt about it.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Have watched it more times than I can count. Lost my first copy and had to order it again.  Love it.
034580404X|2.0|i cannot believe this book became such a big seller.  Did it have an editor? Did anyone other than the author read the finished manuscript?  It reads like the diary of a pre-teen.  I was shocked at the limited vocabulary and the constant repetition.  The only reason I finished the story was because I became interested in the make-up of Christian -- I wanted to find out what made  him tick.  As for the rest of the trilogy -- it's headed for the garbage.
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|Movie funny, beautiful. Clever plot. Probably have watched it 5 times since I ordered it.  And loved every minute that I did.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Easy to use. Gives me mobility.Just what I needed. I use it every day to calculate my calories and carbs.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Watch it every year around the holidays and LAUGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My grandkids have memorized most of the lines since we have been watching it since they were little
080701429X|5.0|I first read this book 40 years ago, and each time I re-read it, I take more away, because the meaning and purpose of living is specific to the moment of life, as Dr. Frankl expressed.  This is probably the single most important work written in Psychology/Psychiatry in the 20th century.  If you have not read it in a while, re-read it.  If you never read it, do so.
1401907725|5.0|Have looked at them and will probably pass them one. But they look delightful and I would recommend them. Thanks.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|The case works great! When you close it it puts the kindle in sleep mode. My only complaint would be when charging, you have to have it opened to charge. Other than that I still like it.
B003AWRMCE|5.0|Arrived in perfect condition.  Good plot, good acting, plenty of action. We would recommend it to anyone with any interest in this genre.
B007PT1PEY|4.0|How can anyone not like the writing of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle? a little out of time but still enjoyable none the less.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|Guess anything with Barbara Streisand, and this is no exception.  Wonderful plot, great acting and directing. We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|this is truly an amazing second book to the first Hunger Games. I love how the plot develops and even twists a wicked turn at the end (no spoilers!). It took me a bit of getting used to (as with the first one) the style that she writes in, but it not only captures the audience, but you want to read faster so you can get to the next part sooner.  Definitely worth it.  Even better now that I waited until after the hype and I can get the books for $6 instead of $13! on my KINDLE!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is a very good program. It calculates all of the items needed for basic math and algebra. Have not used all of the features, yet, but I am set to do so with this calculator.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I cannot wait for the HBO show to begin again. The next book is better. When does #6 come out?
B001EBV0MG|5.0|One of the best movies ever. Probably a defining character role for Newman. Easy download for my Kindle Fire HD!
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|I picked up this game because it was free and had good reviews. It is a very clever game. You actually draw your stickman character that plays in the game....pretty neat! The game also has the appearance that it was &#34;sketched&#34; in pencil on a pad. The game is actually pretty tough. I have gotten stuck a few times and died many times. The only things I don't like about the game is<br />- You have to start the lever completely over if you die.<br />- If you leave a level and go back, it appears as though you had never been in that level.<br />Other than that, there are a lot of levels and it is fun. My kids like it too.
B007IQX9ZW|3.0|It's a pretty good movie over all, has some great acting by Patton Oswalt and Charlize Theron is pretty good as well.  The story takes a sort of twist at the end that not everyone might enjoy. The biggest issue I would have with this movie is the advertisements for it.  This seem to be billed as a crazy comedy movie like Bridesmaids or Hangover II that came out that year.  Instead this is a more thoughtful movie and much more of a drama with comedic elements than a straight comedy.  Insightful at times and funny at others but overall leaving you feeling more introspective than like you had a good belly laugh.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|What can you say....Michael Buble has a great voice and he does a great job singing the Xmas tunes on this CD. Highly recommended.
B00979CS50|3.0|It's just &#34;OK.&#34;  Instead of &#34;Hey hey, my my,&#34; it becomes &#34;Hey hey now now.&#34;  Come on Neil; after all these years this is best you can do.
B0081JFGQU|5.0|This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home.
B004FK24ZA|5.0|Makes you think of the old days when people treated each other with respect and cared more abouth each other than money and material things.
0793542049|5.0|Very nice book to add additional cords and structure to the artists knowledge.  The book is very well written for understanding from a novice to a skilled player.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|hi I love this app I don't have to buy anything it is like a real live carnival game I just want to be able to get the puzzel pieces faster
B005LMEB8E|5.0|This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! Let me start by saying that every book I read I try to guess what's going to happen and most of the time I come close but this book is the first I have read that completely took me by gut wrenching surprise! My heart actually ached when Sky starts to delve into her past. This is a beautiful, crazy, heart shattering, lovely book that I highly recommend!!!!

B004JN1D2I|5.0|It's nice to have the four books in one set. I can just keep reading on from one to the next. The series has definitely captured my interest and I'm hooked now! I love that the chapters go back and forth between characters. It makes me very curious and want to keep reading!

B007YOC4RW|5.0|This is a great album to listen to while traveling, at work, sitting around with friends or just working around my home.
B001684L0A|5.0|I ordered this dvd after hearing much about it. It is a long movie and it is well worth watching.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Excellent treatment, great products, quick shipment and a lot of products to consider. Big time recommended for all the techies
0525953728|5.0|I sent this book to my husband down range and he finished it in 2 days. The other day I asked him how the book was, and he told me that it was pretty good.
B0086700CM|4.0|it was a very good game. I like the sensitivity levels. al every once in a while I change the sensitivity so the game dose not get to easy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app allows me to not only get my weather but also other areas as well at anytime by adding  them to my locations
B0060D0S12|5.0|Who doesn't love this movie?  I mean, my kids watch it, and the next thing I know I'm watching it alongside them!  A respectable coming of age movie.  So easy and great for download on Kindle.
B005SCSL56|5.0|I'm a librarian in an elementary school, so I read LOTS of kid/teen books, and this book definitely makes my top 10 list.  I read this book out loud to my 11-year-old daughter.  We both absolutely loved this book and didn't want to put it down at night.  I'm really hoping that Mr. Colfer comes out with another book about the Land of Stories.
B002RKSZKI|3.0|This book was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She is a Jane Austen fan.  I think this particular novel just did not hold her interest as the others did.  The verdict is still out on this one.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Read this book before and really enjoyed it, enough to read it again. Just got a Kindle Fire and wanted it as part of my library.
B00003CXE7|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies all time.  This was a good purchase for the price.  Bought it as a gift for myself.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a very good book it's like learning about someone else's life and was very descriptive.I loved this very book.
0545265355|5.0|When I purchased this set, it was the best online deal at the time.  Books arrived quickly.  My daughter was pleasantly surprised to get the entire set as a hard cover.  Will continue to purchase my books on Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|The first app I got. Why? Well, I played this on some other devices, and it was absolutely EPIC. It gets harder, you can buy so much, special powerups...everything! You might say subway surfers is better, or maybe brave temple run. I respect your opinion if you think so...but remember, this one is the classic! As you play, you get more skill, and coins get easier to have. It's really fun, REALLY popular, and just really great. Get it!GET IT!<br /><br />  Of course, that's just my opinion. I think most people would agree to my positive write up because temple run is really truly as great as I say, maybe even better. But be warned! You might frustrated or bored...it is a warning that's unlikely to happen...=D<br /><br />Get it now!
1932735410|4.0|The book is pretty straightforward.  It is complimentary to a few other materials I am using from a course that I took.  Great book.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|Well, the title says it all. It's an original puzzle game, definitely. It's a good price..free! A lot of games that cost money are less fun then this. If you want to find a game to entertain you for a while, the you should totally get this. Not perfect...that's my opinion, only because there are a few...annoying...quirks. but you should still probably get this=D
B000AARKO4|3.0|i like this move, I can't really explain why.  So of course I had to buy it.  Delivery was timely and I still watch it from time to time.  Will buy movies through Amazon again.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|We enjoy watching movies as a family, and the ages of our children are spread out.  We can all watch and enjoy this movie together.  We were happy to add it to our collection.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|I caught the last series and got hooked that I am catching up on previous episodes to see how Dexter started out.
0446554995|5.0|I just completed \\"Two Graves\\" and am happy to say I think it was a fitting ending to the trilogy. I could not put the book down once I reached pg 400. I missed some sleep last night, and was also off my game at work today. Some loose ends still exist, but they will allow Preston& Child a variety of places to go with their recurring characters. The only fault or downside for me was the German words that were used throughout the novel. Without translations for them, I felt I missed out on something. Well done again, you two!
B00127RAJY|3.0|I normally love workout videos. but this one isn't very organized. As in she doesn't do the same things on the right side as the left...there isn't any counting aloud that lets you know your getting the same workout in your right arm & your left. Its not a bad video at all. I just didn't like it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|wow i love it it's so much fun defently rating it is so so so so so so much apropreit.
B0063IH60K|4.0|its solitaire, its free, and it gives you multiple playing options.  Its a good, free app that kills time & hasn't had any problems yet.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|You can get angry!!!  not too bad. Addicted to it... Good game while you are waiting bX the. Time go so fast and the diner could be done next day hehehehe if u don't control yourself.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love having it on my phone, love having it on my kindle.  Keeps my kids busy, shoot even keeps me entertained. One of the best free apps around.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Other reviewers have expressed  their views so well about this film. I support them and I will add a few words.<br /><br />This film has so much to say about human sexuality for the disabled and those people that come in and out of their lives.... etc.<br />All 3 leads and supporting cast have done an excellent job with what must have been a very challenging script.<br />This film has heart where so many films fail.<br />If you don't have an open mind about the realities of the human condition than this film won't be for you.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual I have read the entire book within a few days (and nights), but I have to say that some parts were a bit lenghty read, without the usual thrill. And, also, I find it a bit less humoŕous than a typical Grisham book.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|A great gathering of super heroes, most with major flaws. Well written and great performances by all. If you like these type shows this one is a must.
B000EUDAWG|5.0|Birthday gift for an 8 year old grandson.  He loves it, uses it mostly to startle/scare his sisters.  Thank you.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Then this one is for you.. Adrien Brody did an amazing Job! this really was a great movie, A must see!
B008KYOCA2|1.0|It wouldn't link to any of my calendars and after multiple tries it would only schedule on Dec 31, 1969. Seriously!??
B000AGTPUK|5.0|Starting to watch the Polar Express every holiday season with my son and he love it! very sweet and magical movie!
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Great album.  Every song is memorable.  This album does seem to have an undercurrent of sadness to it though, so I don't listen to it when I'm down, but that's it.  Otherwise it's on a constant rotation on my iPhone.
034580404X|5.0|I LOVE these books.VERY WELL WRITTEN. I want a Christian Grey in my Life.<br />All 50 shades of him to myself.
B005RAO0GS|5.0|Every song on this album could be a single.  It is great, and I can not stop listening to it.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I could not believe that when it came it had 3 of my favorite places to visit on the cover. Recommend...Yes!
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Good show, scifi, one of the things throughout this series though that made me mad is they show the first show of a two parter and not the second, that sucks, otherwise good show.
B003F9G8B8|4.0|The movie was fairly streamlined...there were just a few hiccups where the video was not in sync ( picture stopped while narration continued), but for the most part I would and did recommend the site to my fellow classmates.
0345529057|5.0|the books are great and made a great gift.  The box they come in made them easy to wrap and were a hit at Christmas.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|This is a great movie, adults and kids will get a great deal of enjoyment from it.  It is funny.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story makes you feel good. Its a kind of story you will love to read. The author had  the appropraite plot for this kind of story.Im looking forward to read more from this author.
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|Ordered for my fiance who loves this movie, came on day it stated, early in the morning too, very pleased!!
B0063GORYU|1.0|Cards are difficult to more or go where they are placed.  Don't understand why this spider is more difficult then they other one.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Does the job, small, compact, works perfect for our overseas son who needed a quick way to transfer files.<br />Was sent as promised, everything we need.  Thanks
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have always enjoyed this Solitaire.  It is sometime difficult to get the cards to move like I want them.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Really like all the levels to choice from. This is a really fun game for both me and my son.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A game lots of people are playing and it makes a challenge to play something different while traveling.  It is a little difficult to learn how to aim the fireing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Keeps me busy. I play it everyday and now my 7 yr old son likes to play it too and easy for him to play.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|This is the type of game I can play by the hour.  I play one like it on my computer.
0316069434|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my mom who reads all the Michael Connelly books.  She read it in a short period of time and loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This is a dumb game.  I could not find a challenge or any way to improve the game.  Ended up buying it in a attempt to get to Pac-Man.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked these books. The author created interest and concern for the characters from the first line that  continues and builds until the end of the last.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Our family always likes to follow the weather and now we will have it where ever we can get wi-fi.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|In the Acknowledgements, Cline thanks some of his Hollywood contacts for thinking that the book might make a good film.  Little wonder then, since the prose is written with so many superfluous elaborations that it reads like a screenplay.  I wrote that way as a teenager, feeling it necessary to call out every motivation or feeling of the characters though these extra words had no impact on the atmosphere or plot.  The editor would be wise to wield their red pen more liberally next time.<br /><br />As most may agree, the real treat in this work is the heavy dose of nostalgia Cline leads us through.  Those who spent their formative years in 1980s suburbia will experience vivid memories of their childhood springing up to meet Cline's vision of the world.  The predictable and rather saccharine journey serves much like a Disney park ride to carry the viewer past scene after scene of childhood with tense but predictably resolved challenges.<br /><br />Recommended for the nostalgia, but the plot, character development and overweight descriptive brush make for a lost opportunity at a much greater work.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Cannot get it up since the original purchase.  It was fun the one time I got to play it.  I would like to play it again.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I love this box set! and the book that comes with it! Of course the movies are fantastic and I'm just so pleased to have them in my collection.
B003UAKE9Y|2.0|I guess I am too old for this. I hated it. The animation is ugly and the terrors are stupidly unrealistic. There is hardly anything to feel compassionate about. Are we glad she went back home and her busy parents gave her gloves she wanted? Worse yet -  I bought this DVD and the book -- and have ordered the doll -- and then watched with my grandchild who is struggling with her parents' divorce (after I consulted several sources concerning its appropriateness). I am going to read the book, however and see if the author can be redeemed. If this is what kids want, there is a worse future ahead of them.
0765325950|5.0|The wheel of time has captured the last 10 years of my life. I like many fans have been sucked in by the characters and have waited so long to find out what happens. After reading I'm happy it's finally over, however the book was a chore to read. I can't believe the fans would 1 star a book just because it wasn't available on their Kindle. Obviously Harriet has her reasons for doing what she did, but who cares. If it wasn't for her there would be no ending. To give 1 Star just because something can't be easily downloaded to your device is a crap way of rating the book. To sit there and put a 1 star rating on a series you have obviously put a lot of time and love into, to me, is ridiculous.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Why do I not get the update yet when it is out already and other people have it? I should not have to keep waiting especially when I paid for it.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|I admit I was pleasantly surprised how good this album is.  After buying the comeback albums of Eagles/Steely Dan/CSNY (all of which suck, even though they are some of my favorite all-time bands), the new ZZ Top album is great.  They go back to their roots with some of the most basic/raw music I've heard from them.  Can't wait for the next one.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|very good app. I love this app its the best app ive ever had. one of the apps that will stay on my kindle fire for a long time
0385535147|5.0|I have never bought a bad book written by Gresham.  All are very good to read on a Sunday afternoon.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|gives you insight into a place you never hope to go to but at the same time you are rooting for the poor sap that is there.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is for people that like games where u manage a park. It's very addicting and doesn't need real money to be fun. I highly recommend this game no matter what kind of gamer u are.
B0067RQYNW|4.0|Kingsoft office for android is simple to use. Files can also easily be shared and sent to an email account.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the Slammed series but this is by far my favorite book. I hope they make a movie out of this one!!!  This is a must read!
0374214913|4.0|Clay, laid off in the Great Recession from a high-tech bagel company, takes the graveyard shift at a 24-hour bookstore in a bad neighborhood in San Francisco. Soon after, he realizes that the bookstore is a front for a secret cult searching - in books, of course - for the key to immortality.  Clay and his Google-employed girlfriend Kat decide to bring technology to the quest.<br /><br />This is a fun mystery, filled with interesting characters and suspense (and the books on the cover glow in the dark, to boot).  The novel zips along to its cheery finale, ultimately a tale of how friends help each other set against a backdrop of books (and fonts! When was the last time I read a book where fonts played a major role? Never!).  An occasional line struck me as particularly clunky, although at least as often Sloan achieves a nice turn of phrase (\\"This cult seems like it might have been designed specifically to prey on bookish old people-Scientology for scholarly seniors\\").  The ending is undoubtedly a little bit cheesy, complete with a lengthy epilogue tying up every conceivable loose end.<br /><br />Yet despite these critiques, I enjoyed the friendships, the tension between traditional paper books and digitized information, the swift pacing, and the colorful characters.  Kevin McFarland at the AV Club (Nov 19, 2012) gave it a B+ and called it \\"[[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]] for typography nerds.\\"<br /><br />Note on content:  Not too much language (no f-bombs, 6 sh-bombs), one \\"off-screen\\" sex scene (i.e., the narrator pans away at the first tracing of a bra strap).<br /><br />Another few lines I enjoyed:<br /><br />\\"These days, the phone only carries bad news.  It's all `your student loan is past due' and `your uncle Chris is in the hospital.'  If it's anything fun or exciting, like an invitation to a party or a secret project in the works, it will come through the internet.\\" (216)  Technology rocks!<br /><br />\\"I am really into the kind of girl you can impress with a prototype.\\" (55)  Geek paradise!<br /><br />\\"He's like a storybook spirit, a little djinn or something, except instead of air or water his element is imagination.\\" (23)  Great image!<br /><br />\\"I press my hand onto the fellowship's symbol - two hands, open like a book - and when I take it away, there's an oily, five-fingered print left behind.\\" (221)  Foreboding!
B00A376BB2|4.0|While this book is interesting, well presented and written, and easy to understand, it doesn't cover enough ground to be the definitive SQL anti-patterns book.<br /><br />In particular it just didn't cover enough ground on avoiding writing bad queries which is where a lot of anti-patterns in SQL make their way into production code.
B0018J2QB8|4.0|I suggest just buying the whole season and plan a non stop marathon cause you are not going to want to turn it off! While watching you can't imagine how those poor souls who watched it on TV could wait those long 7 days to watch the next one. I am not going to talk about the plot cause I don't want to give anything away, but if you like season 1 you will LOVE season 2!
1574214276|5.0|This is a great book which I refer to constantly. There are lots of great tangles and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. I highly recommend this book.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The suspense and action were appealing.  I have seen the other Bourne movies but I found this one with another agent just as exciting and I would recommend it. Would love to see a sequel with both agents and see what Paula Landy would do with them!
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Like a lot of Stephen King books 11/22/63 starts off with a gripping premise, begins meandering in the middle, and ends abruptly and somewhat unsatisfactorily. My expectation were low coming in. I like King for the most part, but this book looked to be a Baby Boomer spank-fest. However, I liked the book from the beginning. In my opinion the book kind of bogs down in the middle. Then before you know it the JFK assassination is already passed. The ending of the book explains little, and parts of it you can see coming from miles away. I'd recommend only for the Stephen King fanboys who have read everything else. If you're new to King read his earlier works. Heck if you're a King veteran, just reread some of his earlier works. This one is best left on the shelf.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Both Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling were great - love all the twists and turns. Would highly recommend for anyone who likes Hopkins or Gosling!
B0018S6YO4|5.0|Some great songs that is privileged for you are not tired of already hearing them on the radio. But it was also refreshing because the Reloaded album has many tracks that were never on the radio.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Easy to use no hassle, I would recommend this case to anyone looking for a carrying case for their Kindle.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|all the functions it said it will do does it flawlessly.Like it s compact size. Will sharpen just about every thing.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|My grandson loves it, wants to play it all the time. He is five so I have to help him but he is catching on fast.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is so fun it is like Mario bros but different if you want a app like this Mario bros or just a fun arcade app get this luv it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It has constant missions to be completed. Wish there was a little bit more to it. Only complaint would be that it does not acknowledge the internet connection for me to visit friends.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book very interesting and I could not put it down once I started I really did enjoy this book.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|excellant gives you the up to date info you need, helps you plain your weekend or up coming events a must have.

B003Q6D2B4|5.0|i just love bruce willis. excellent movie 5 stars. i think this is one of his better movies. it was great
B006OV7RQ4|3.0|*<br /><br />SPOILER WARNING !<br /><br />The 3 Star rating was for the acting of Elizabeth Olsen, the main character.<br /><br />I despised the ending.<br />There were no consequences for the cult's criminal behavior..<br />The cult just letting themselves into someone's house and killing the owner for nothing was reason alone to want to see them Busted.<br />A commune cult with a revolting entitlement attitude.<br /><br />I'm glad I only caught this on one of my existing movie channels.<br />Otherwise, I'd want my money back.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I had ordered the black case, but received the purple one even though the outside of the box identified it as black. I filled out the online info to exchange the item shortly after Christmas. Within minutes I had received an apologetic email and they sent me the correct case via overnight shipping! Great service. It was a gift for my brother, and he seems really happy with the product itself.
B0084U0IEG|2.0|I read about half, but still couldn't get into it and that is very unusual for me. It just didn't move along.
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I like this game, its pretty fun, its similiar to Blitz but with less graphics.  I find it keeping me busy more times than not. :) i'd recommend it! Esp. if your a True Blitzer Like myself!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|this is by far the best movie of all and it is my wifes favorite movie to watch she loves it
B008CIUS72|1.0|I really hate it because it doesnt work! I hate it i hate it i hate it i ahte it all!!!!!!!

B004FOOQV6|5.0|Very nice layout & simple to use.  While the application does not do anything that you could not do with a calculator, I was pleasantly surprised with the ease of use.
B008Y6UND6|5.0|Great story, great actors, great fun. Keeps your attention start to finish with countless sub-plots within sub-plots making nothing seem clear. Creepy subject matter intertwined with good old-fashioned who-done-it..Dark cinematography adds to the creepiness.  Loved It and want more.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app lets you create multiple notebooks, and the app says they can be sent as a .pdf file.  Should I want to print them, that possibility appeals to me.<br /><br />Since I have been a journaler for years, this is a new and quick way to write something when I am traveling.  Further, I can use it to keep track of things like phone numbers, requests people make, etc.<br /><br />For people who like journals, this is an app to own.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thisis a very fun game, I had it on my phone and wanted it for kindle and they had it!
0446554995|5.0|I feel a bit guilty, admitting to loving this grab bag of thriller conventions, but it's just so well done that I can't help it.  Pendergast, of course, is that Sherlockian collection of odd quirks that we have loved since he first appeared in 1995's [[ASIN:031285630X Relic]].  Well, he has more than one address and no Dr. Watson, but he is the real deal nonetheless, with encyclopedic knowledge and an eye for capturing the smallest detail.  In \\"Two Graves\\", however, he shows off a bit more of his James Bond side, and it results in something that is more of an action/thriller than some of the previous, more cerebral volumes.  There have always been aspects of the macabre or even supernatural in his adventures, and this one has them, too.  I won't say more about them here, though there are numerous spoilers to be found in other reviews.<br /><br />By now, most readers should be aware that \\"Two Graves\\" is the concluding volume in a trilogy that is being called the \\"Helen\\" trilogy, named after his wife, Helen Esterhazy Pendergast, and it is obliged to tie up all those messy loose ends of the previous two books, [[ASIN:B004X8W7JW Fever Dream]] and [[ASIN:0446554979 Cold Vengeance]].  It also substantially advances the stories of Corrie Swanson and Constance Greene.  That's a boatload of subplots -- engaging ones, to be sure! -- that have no real connection to the main story, which itself deals with so many important events so rapidly that you don't dare stop reading.  Breathless, yes; sensible, who cares! Much of the action has some DNA borrowed from other thrillers, including those of the aforementioned British agent, and to that extent at least one can legitimately complain that Messrs. Preston and Child were a trifle lazy.  But their fans should find this to be a tremendously satisfying and major chapter in the Pendergast saga.
B00846REIS|5.0|Recommend to all.  This book is like so many people's lives. We all have something in our past that has messed with our present, but there is a way to find someone to help us have a better future.  But it's a battle worth fighting.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|What a disappointment.  I found this ridiculous to the point of being unwatchable and didn't even watch to the end.  Waste of time.  Fight scenes were lame and very subdued for this kind of movie, acting was uninspired and the voice of the bad guy was laughable.  I have enjoyed previous Batman movies with Christian Bale.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I love the story lines and the characters. You have to pay attention as it goes back and forth from future, past and present but AHS is awesome. Some of the episodes in this season were a little boring though and left me wondering if I liked it and then it got better again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love this book!!  I will totally be purchasing the other two! I always wondered what all the hype was about with this book and now I most certainly know why!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. Have been watching since season 1. It has ups, downs, emotional days and lots of zombie brains flying everywhere but most of all I believe this show teaches about survival and team work in order to survive.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Life of Pi was a very interesting read. It takes you to a scary place and shows how resourceful we need to be to survive. The twists and turns make the story intriguing. The descriptions of the animals is so personal and paint a picture that was quite new at least for me. I highly recommend the Audible edition too.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I am a dedicated Dan Fan so I had to buy this. How sad that you don't hear any of this music on the radio. The first listen revealed nothing that caught my interest but the second and third allow the music to grow on you. It's a worthy addition to Mr. Fagen's catalog.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|How Quentin Tarantino takes his love of crappy B movies and distills out the essential best from usually low budget exploitation dross and cross pollinates genres to come up with something singular and unique is one of the more interesting phenomena in recent movie history.  Love him or hate him, his movies are their own thing and all of this obsession for spaghetti Westerns and Chop-socky martial arts films etc. would be for nought if he wasn't also a superb filmmaker.  All of this is on display, for good or ill, in Django Unchained.  Yes, it is over-the-top bloody to the point of parody.  It is also funny as hell.  And finally, it is one of the more honest depictions of the sheer brutality of slavery ever put on a film, and a perfectly raised middle finger to the romantic fantasy of Gone With the Wind and the decades of whitewashed history of that loathesome institution.<br /><br />Thank heavens Tarantino and Christoph Waltz found each other.  He is absolutely wonderful here and Quentin has a fine actor who obviously relishes delivering Tarantino's delicious dialogue. It was one of those fortuitous meetings of talent that bring to mind Ford & Wayne and Scorcese & Deniro, a perfect blend of author and actor.  Sam Jackson is equally fine as always as a vehicle for whatever Tarantino needs from him.  Jamie Foxx plays well as Django, and Leonardo DiCaprio is up to the task as a vile slave master couching his own brutality in the trappings of wealth, privilege and overly fine manners. The character puts the lie to all that antebellum Southern plantation finery built upon a lie and the most detestable social construct imaginable.<br /><br />But, that is the sober underpinnings to a typical Tarantino outing of politically incorrect dialogue and action, near cartoonish violence, and hilariously imagined situations and characters.  This isn't history, but with all the incongruous dialogue and attitudes for the period, it somehow hits a truth often missed in more period centered films.<br /><br />Tarantino's films aren't for everyone.  The violence is excessively bloody, which will offput many.  I found it so overly bloody that it is obviously movie violence taken to the nth degree, and thus manifestly make-believe.  But, I don't know how that would apply to or effect impressionable minds (a discussion we will have for a long time).<br /><br />I have always gone to Tarantino's movies expecting to dislike them and he always seems to win me over with the unexpected humor and the bravado and sheer inventiveness of the enterprise.  For a filmmaker with a reputation for violent action, I've never seen one who more effectively employs the closeup as a technique.  He loves to get right up in his actors faces as they deliver his wonderful lines.  And in every movie he will throw in something so unexpectedly funny as the scene here of Big Daddy's night riders bitching about the holes cut in the sacks they're wearing over their heads not allowing them to see where they're going.  That and many other non sequiters and assorted cleverness strewn through his films keeps me coming back.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Always nice to know no matter where you go you can check in and see what's going on with everyone!
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|This is top notch filmmaking.  Not a documentary, but a movie based on fact. That means the characters are composites of many people, dialogue is invented, and chronologies shifted and arranged to tell a coherent story. When all the controversy and argument is exhausted we are left with a stunning thriller based on facts but not necessarily precisely factual. This should, of course, be understood of any historical fiction.  A movie simply cannot explain everything in detail, most especially a ten year hunt for one man among billions.<br /><br />This is a fine film attesting to those who toil in obscurity to keep our sorry keisters safe.  Within the confines and strictures of a 2 plus hour film it tries to capture the long, arduous, lonely work of intelligence gathering, and the frustration of the search for the proverbial needle in a haystack.  I think this does so entertainingly, and that is no mean feat.<br /><br />The harsh treatment of detainees depicted in the beginning of the film is appropriate if it is understood in the context of the sheer panic within the relevant institutions that another attack as terrible as 9/11 or even more so was imminent. Whether the film over emphasizes this or depicts the amount and extent of time within which this took place fairly or not, I cannot answer.  It certainly doesn't sugarcoat it nor does it celebrate this treatment.  It opts to present it clearly and unflinchingly.  I do think it errs in not clarifying that after the initial panic, and even during this time, more traditional interrogation techniques were the norm.  But let there be no doubt, this was rough business with very determined and implacable foes, and I appreciated the intercutting of newsreel footage of the bombs going off worldwide while these analysts and operators were under enormous pressure to stop the carnage.<br /><br />Apparently, the lead to the courier that took them to Bin Laden came from several sources, and if the film leaves the impression thatit was solely through harsh interrogation that it was obtained, that is unfortunate.  The film does make it clear that the final clue, the courier's real name and not his nom de guerre was found otherwise.  Anyway, this section of the film is where the controversy lies, and none of us writing here knows the real truth of it.<br /><br />Past that, the movie depicts the years of sacrifice of Maya, based on a real CIA analyst and probably a composite of several.  Many people spent long and fruitless hours and years in the search for Bin Laden, often at the risk of their own lives.  I think the movie fairly captures that effort.<br /><br />When the film gets to the raid in Abbottabad it kicks into high gear and Kathryn Bigelow's unerring knack for directing action makes a known outcome still a pulse-pounding, tense and breathless piece of business.  Extremely well done.<br /><br />Jessica Chastain is terrific as the dedicated analyst with apparently no social life, unsparingly sacrificing all to the mission.  Jennifer Ehle, always great, nicely represents the senior analyst that was a crucial part of this story and I was glad her & her collegues story was represented here as I recall the headlines surrounding it.  Jason Clarke, again always great, is perfect as the operator conducting the harsh interrogations with no qualms.  He plays dirty with tough customers, but it also wears on him. Mark Strong is always a reassuring and solid presence.  No fault in any of the casting.<br /><br />The film makes clear that the War On Terror is truly war at its meanest, nastiest and truest.  The innocent can be harmed as well as the guilty.  And as Stan McCrystal recently said, the problem with \\"torture\\" is the harm it does to the perpetrator as much or more so as to the subject in that it is a path once taken, no one can be sure where it will lead.  But to forget the context of panic and terror for those charged with our security in those days following 9/11 is I believe an unfairoversight.<br /><br />Zero Dark Thirty very clearly depicts a determined, hardened, ruthless, pitiless enemy and the people we charge to stop them.  It also shows the extraordinary sacrifice and determination of a few of them to hunt down and bring justice to the author of so much of this maiming, death, and heartache.  That they got Bin Laden at all is still a stunning piece of work. The movie honors that work.
B00884GR0W|1.0|Too long to learn. Playing on your phone is for killing time not complicated maps and options. I can tell a lot of hard work went to this but epic fail in my opinion.
B0011EU0NG|4.0|My toddler loved this movie but scratched the DVD.  Had to order another just to keep on hand.  Great family movie.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Great CD!  If you love the show (I do), you'll love the music (I do), even if country music isn't ordinarily your thing (for me, it's not)!
B004SKQAJI|5.0|I like the danceing and intertainment. I would advice anyone to get Lord of the Dance and River dance. Very Good.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|Most free apps have more programing than this one.<br />I only played with it for 1 day, but it didn't have the functionality I wanted, so I paid $$ for a different one that matched my needs (multiple schedules: work, home/family, personal), and that also included a To Do List.<br /><br />For simple schedules, it would work fine.
034580404X|4.0|So book 1 I read in 2 days. It was quite intriguing and naughty. But you can't put it down. Book 2 does a good job of  bringing the story full circle so you have to read it. Took me about 3 days. Book 3 was almost unnecessary. The premise is good but I don't think it went deep enough considering how deep book 1 and 2 went. It could have just been combined with book 2 in my opinion. All in all I'm pleased. I decided to fit it in between semesters and read it in no time.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|None of the crispness of the earlier movies. Damon was a much better Bourne. A very ho hum movie, saad that I spent the money.
B0091QS88K|4.0|My children love this game!  They seem to never tire of it:) Its a great game for all ages.  Both my 4 and 8 year d enjoy playing.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I would tell all that it is easy to use and fun.. So easy and fun to see the game to just slide onto the screen.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|In my opinion, \\"Asylum\\" isn't as good as the first season of AHS, but I still watch faithfully every week. Good Actors and nice plots
B001AH6ZWY|3.0|The movie was good. I love Jodie Foster, but the ending was a let down for me. Was expecting a lot more.
034580404X|5.0|Actually a wonderful story line and a great love story.  I would love to see E.L. James write these books from Christian's point of view also.  A great read.
B00000IZOR|5.0|It's really entertaining for kids. Of course, you as an adult may think &#34;Can this be entertaining enough for my child?&#34; The answer is: Definetely!!! Fisher Prece created this beautiful toy for children and they just love it. The eyes move when the cord is pulled. and the dial rings when you try to dial a number. The colors are bright and the plastic used is durable. Good price, Good product.
B000063V8U|5.0|I purchased the Sixth Season - Star Trek TNG for my husband as a Christmas gift.  It arrived quickly and just as the item should.  Absolutely no problems.  I had a great shopping experience and will definitely shop here again!!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|If you are looking for a great book that will keep you flipping through the pages this is the book for you
B004V7EW66|5.0|I really like this album of Paul Simon's. His music is always so fresh with new things. The great thing is that even with many listens, I still find something new with each one. I listen to it when I go for my morning walks or when I am in my &#34;quiet time&#34; at night and working on the computer. It is pure excellence as Paul has always delivered, in my opinion. I have been following Paul Simon throughout his entire career...he just keeps getting...well, different and fresh...I was going to type better, but that would take away from his early music and it is still near and dear to my life.
B0077ATSSQ|1.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie with Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock both attached to this project.  Sadly, it is not was horrible movie was an annoying main character, Oskar, a spoiled brat who I in no way cared about or could relate with.<br />The movie is long, boring and drags out with no redeeming moral at the end, which I was hoping for and pretty much the only reason I finished watching.  Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are not in the movie enough and the fact that 9/11 is a back drop for the plot doesn't save this story either.  Don't waste two hours of your life watching this when there are so many other movies out there.
B006BDHAX0|4.0|I love playing, it keeps me sharp. My 6 year old enjoys helping find matches and it's good for helping her look for details.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Rachel Brice has been a huge inspiration to me; seeing her dancing was one of the key reasons I started taking belly dance lessons.  I have been learning traditional belly dance for a few years now, and bought this to give my practice some variety and to enhance and hone my skills, as well as finally take the leap towards tribal/fusion dance.  I just tried disc one of this set last night.  It's a very long workout if you do everything on the disc-over two hours of activity!  I did it all last night because I had some free time on my hands, but most days I wouldn't have time to make a 2 hour workout the norm.  Thankfully, Rachel suggests different combinations of the drills you can do over the week to break it up and make it more doable every day.  The yoga she begins and ends with is excellent, and the drills all start out with basic, easy to do movements that gradually incorporate more layering techniques to make them more challenging.  She breaks down most of the movements step by step, though I did find one or two moves that befuddled me a tiny bit.  I found her description of the taxeem the most lacking in detail.  Overall this is a beautiful, informative dvd and I look forward to working with it more!
B007AMMZA4|4.0|Great movie I enjoyed watching it, I have watched this 3 times now, amazon you amaze me with the things I find on your site.
B00A757EFW|1.0|You really need a joystick for this. The touch sensor makes it difficult to maneuver.  And when going Down usually brings up the Home menu. Not any fun like it is supposed to be.
B0096HIEE2|3.0|Ok this one was ok, was not all the hype made it out to be but I had to see for myself. Not to happy I baught this one should have just rented it.

B0070Y46UY|2.0|ok I hope the movie is better than the book because this one is definately a slow read, just can't seem to get into finishing this one.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary has every word. It has understandable meanings to any word you are searching. I love this dictionary a lot.
141694737X|5.0|Whenever our toddler falls apart in the car, we recite this story, and he calms right down. The flaps are easy to tear off so we have replaced the book and the flaps a couple of times, but it's an enduring favorite!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A fun easy read; it was fresh and different.  The fabric of the allegory was thin in spots, but all in all, well done.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game. but when I was on survival mode I found a gold ore and when I destroyed it I didn't get a block of it but still a great game
B00884GR0W|1.0|Uninstalled in less than 5 minutes. I'm sure this is a great game for some but I found it to be mind-numbingly boring.
0345803485|5.0|This book was an excellent gift for my mother it was inexpensive and shipped fast. Once I had gotten the book it was in prefect condition and boxed carefully
B0086700CM|3.0|&ccedil;hallenging but repetitive.  many times it does not respond to the swipes causing crashes at inopportune times.  needs option to start from where you died.
B009MFKO3M|4.0|I've only known one song of theirs prior to buying Lonerism and that was an ace tune. When I bought this album I was blown away by the production. Listening this album is an easy thing to do from beginning to end. Awesome Psychedelia!
030758836X|5.0|My wife got this book for a Christmas present and is going \\" bazinga \\" over reading it page by page.  Recommended for the adventurous and mystery loving people.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great insight into how ridiculous our society's thirst for reality drama can get.  Can't wait to read the next one.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Love this movie, got it as a surprise gift. The best film Disney / Pixar has come up with to date.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a fun app, game, it really gets to you when you get caught or hit something. my three kids love it
B004DLPXAO|5.0|it is better than reading a book. First of all I can use it on my galaxy tab and my ipad, secondly the book has no weight, and thirdly I can adjust the light intensity and the size of the print to match the light, so I can actually read it it without my glasses. I am so used to reading on my tabs now I am digitizing my whole library
B0031RS2HC|3.0|The simplicity of the writing style becomes tedious while the plot, although relatively engrossing and encompassing an interesting concept, tends to follow a formula.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked this book because it dealt with issues students may or may not deal with in high school. Either way the book was interesting and I loved the character because he was sensitive to others feelings. The shocker comes towards the end when you find out what was really bothering him. Overall, good, easy read. Ready to see the movie.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|Written with compassion, but left one feeling the issues hadn't been fully resolved. Was this a court drama or an examination of teenage emotions in an adult world? Overall a bit inconclusive, but nevertheless thought provoking and certainly enough character development to allow the reader to identify.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|It was okay.  It's a little slow in places, but I love the stars so it was definitely worth seeing.
B00000760T|4.0|I was interested in a couple songs only,but the CD was cheap enough to warrant buying for those two songs,all in all an OK purchase.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|Started with the best intentions but was so bored I couldn't make myself finish it.  Don't understand all the hype about this book.
B0053JJLLC|5.0|Excellent read...Fast paced and believable....Michael Crichton can take the distant future and make it believable today!. Keep up the good work!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Wonderful story told with wonderful language. This book will be enjoyed by adults of any age as it has strong messages on how to deal with very unfortunate personal circumstances.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I loved the first season and I love the second season even more!!!! Each episode leaves me waiting in anticipation for the next!
B000G7PNAE|1.0|Yah im gonna get slammed for this review but the truth must be told. When i was 14 years old i thought 1980's Journey was kind of cool i did say 14 years old obviously i outgrew this style of music pretty quick. The reason for that is pure lack of substance, average song writing and most songs geared towards woman in hopes to sell records. That is the reality of what Journey became Steve Perry has a fine voice but only to be heard in smallamounts given the high range to his voice it gets annoying fast. There are two types of music fans, first there are the people who only listen to the radio and never get sick of hearing Dont Stop Believing for the 10,000 time. If you really listen to the lyrics the song makes no sense, you see the problem i have actually the reality with this type of music is it isnt totally authentic, When your soul purpose is to see how many radio hits you can chart and how much cash you can make the music itself isnt really important anymore. Then there is another type of music fan the real music fan the person who thrives on great songwriting, great musicianship, great song craft who loves the true art of music and isnt intrested in album sales or radioplay. The best Journey album was their 1975 debut that album featured five guys playing their hearts out. The best Journey song is Look Into The Future from 1976. The reality is if it wasnt for Neal Schon and Gregg Rollie forming Journey your precious Steve Perry would never have joined the band. For the most part the 1980's were a disgrace the music was too commercial and watered down. For anyone who is up to expanding their muscial taste check out the 1975 debut and leave this crap behind.
B001N1DPDE|4.0|It's a great knife. Nice and heavy, quality steel, decent design . Greatest fall back of the Ka-Bar Becker series of knives are the scales on the handles. Way to slick for the kinds of knives they are putting them on. The last thing I want to do is accidentally throw my bk7 at a friend while chopping or shaving bark off a limb.    I solved the grip issue with a temporary fix. Tennis racket grip. We'll see how this holds up. Most likely for beans. I'm definitely picking up the micarta scales for this blade at some point soon.    Tennis racket grip was a no go. Micarta scales are the solution.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really liked this book.I'm on the third...can\\"t wait to see the outcome.<br />Some of it was a little too much but over all I liked the story.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The series may have been written so an idiot could read them however they are perfect for entertainment value  I couldn't put them down. Sometimes I love a \\"read \\" I don't have to think about
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|Funnier remake that's not a remake<br /><br />Jonah Hill shines in this movie<br /><br />Tatum almost makes up for his stripper movie
8866130931|5.0|I have been using this same diary for about 6 years now and I think will never change for any other. It is perfect for what I need as on the left page you can plan one whole week and on the right you have the notes page to add any extra 'to do list'  that don't go on a particular day, add notes from your doctor, addresses, phone numbers, reminders, bank account or credit card balance, etc. Perfect size and very practical. On the inner pocket you can keep business cards, pictures, appointment cards, or any important document you should carry around on your way to your meeting. Just perfect! For those of you who need a lot of space to write on each day, you may want to consider another kind of planner or maybe the extra large size as this one only allows a few notes/appointments per day.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the best. Well I think how about u try it try it. I like it because of all the game selection and u earn points to get more games that's even better

B006OAB432|5.0|I'm very happy with how fast this item was shipped as well as the quality of the record.  I bought it as a Christmas gift and it was sent to me very quickly -- much appreciated
0062082353|5.0|I chose 5 stars because of how well written the book was.  It wasn't what I expected at all, it was better.  I couldn't put it down it was that good.  The author used a lot of humor in describing his life.  I appreciated that he did not apologize for his military career.  He was trained to be a sniper.  He took his job seriously.  He never forgot that the lives of other U.S. military were in his hands and he protected them to the best of his ability.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who &#34;thinks&#34; they know what the book is about.  The author breaks the stereotype of war story books.  Lastly, it is written the way you would imagine he would talk in real life.  I laughed many many times.  Not the kind of emotion you would think a book with this title would create.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Took about a day to complete.  A good little escape from ordinary life.  Well done graphics , good puzzles , appreciated hints , fun story.
B005FISBTO|5.0|Any Dexter fan needs this in their library. I would recommend collecting the whole set. And when you're finished viewing it you can always resell it if you don't want to keep it. There are a lot of us Dexter fans out there who will be glad to buy it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series was AWESOME!!  I checked out the first one at the Libary and the second I finished it I bought Fifty Shades Darker from Amazon.  Book one and two were the same I couldn't wait until I could turn the page.  It's not at all what I expected.  From the talk of the book I didn't think that I would like it, but it has ended up being a fave.  One of the best series I've ever read.  Just make sure when you start you have time to finish all three.  LOVED, LOVED, LOVED!!
B00933JL0A|2.0|I was really disappointed with this game.  I found it boring. There are a lot of games out there better than this.  Royal envoy is my favorite.
145210655X|5.0|Better for older &#34;kids&#34; I think.  I laughed out loud, and while I am not sure my 7 year old grasps all the humor quite yet, even he got the gist of it. This is a cute story/comic book and a great gift for any star wars fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very nice game.  A real go to game.  It's a fun, yet challenging game.  I also enjoyed bridges --  a related and similar games

B00884GR0W|1.0|I thought that this game offered very little in instructions on how to play.  It was not at all what I was expecting when I purchased it.
B007IK44CK|5.0|Great action and character development. Really stood out from the other Mission Impossible movies. Tom Cruise has not lost his touch!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a really nice little game.  Of all the versions I have seen, this is my favorite one.  It's nice to be able to polar bingo when you are alone

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I'm not a &#34;Game of Thrones&#34; groupie by any means.  But I have enjoyed Mr. Martin;s books and the HBO series as well.  I will definately see season #3 and buy the next book.  What an amazing imagination.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Loved every minute of this romantic and thrilling novel. It's like Harry potter for adults! You can't put it down.
B004P1JEWU|5.0|Although a 3erd book, this novel still keeps you interested in those characters you have learnt to love at the beginning.  Or hate.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This soundtrack provides all of the great songs from the epic film (which you should certainly see first if you haven't already!!).  The songs sound just as good on CD as they did in the theater.  Personally, I was just as emotionally effected re-listening to them.  This is certainly well-worth its low price tag here on Amazon.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|My daughter purchased this app for her new kindle to take notes and keep organized.  She loves it.  Said it works great.
0061928356|5.0|I loved this book and gave it to my daughter who adopted a child from China.  I think it address a lot of the possible issues of the teen years.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Found myself confused at the beginning but then it all made sense. Overall, the best batman movie in my opinion. Makes way for another sequel: Batman and Robin!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Son gave me a Kindle for Xmas. Bought this ebook as my first purchase. I have read all the other books penned by these authors and the book continues the line very well and closes many prior open issues quite well. Hope to see Pendergast again soon. As fir my Kindle it kept losing itself making me go back many times to find my place. Very irritating but it happens a lot with written novels too when my place marker falls out. Still I thought that this was a major glitch in the Kindle itself and nit the book.<br /><br />While Pendergast seems to be winding down Gideon seems to be ramping up. Hope to see a new novel if either gentleman soon.
B000001EC1|4.0|This disc contains probally their most popular hits,a couple of new songs and a newer(at that time) version of \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\",which is a more slower version compared to the original.Overall,if you are a fan of classic rock,and/or just getting into Bon Jovi's music,this cd would be a nice introduction to the band.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|This game is one that my 2 year old likes to play too. It is a little glitchy and I just close the app and open it again and usually it is fine after that. If you are not a very accurate 'pointer' you will not achieve your goal. It is a pretty touchy game.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham's mind is fantastic! Well, written and keeps you hungry for more! Great story line with twists and turns!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first these puzzles were super easy but that's to be expected. I was 'caught' playing this game by my 2 year old daughter and she wanted to play too. So I showed her what to do and she did some of the 'pipes' all by herself! She loves to play it just as much as I do.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I find this game fun.  it was not too easy but not too hard either .... the hints are just right and don't give away too much I like the fact u can play hidden object or monoco...  fun fun fun
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app does it all. It is just like using the app on a computer. It has all the bells and whistles that the computer would have.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is fun and addicting, I play game almost every day and it is amazing you can change different color sword and you can change the background and they have goals for you to reach,it is the best game in the world to me. I love it!
030771652X|5.0|The service was excellent.  I highly recommend them.  The book was very well written and I enjoyed it very much.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so adictable !!! It is the right game for animal lovers like me ! BUY THE GAME NOW YOU WON'T REGRET!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Seems to cover every genre, drama, romance, action, suspense,while a constant battle of control vs rebellion is fought by every character. This book continues to draw you in and swade you attention, even if you've watched the movie and know the ending. I would recommend this book to most anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|It was like the best thing evaaaaaaarrr<br />Seriously<br />Why would I lie to you?<br />Believe me<br />I promise I'm not a compulsive liar.
B005VPRETE|5.0|My little princess does use her brothers Lego sets, but it was nice to see Legos has finally made sets for 7 year old girls to enjoy building sets.
0345803485|1.0|I take responsibility for choosing to try this book, and I'm still sorry I did. I didn't last past their first night together. I wanted to smack Ana--and I'm not into S&M.<br />Fortunately I got the book from my local library and was able to use self-checkout so no one knows I tried it. I'll be able to return anonymously as well. . .
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Great professional sound and quality for the price, Sounds identical to mics costing four times as much, Great for djs and houses of worship.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I have this case in red and it is the exact shade shown on Amazon.  The case is sturdy, but light, and the elastic is strong so the sides of the case won't separate if I drop the Kindle. I'm happy with this purchase and recommend this item.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Great book, hard to put down. A little sad though, due to sexual abuse. Wish it worked out in real life as it did in the story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked on this series and the players and characters.  Like watching a historical soap opera, only better.  Hunger for more and more.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|So this book was everything I hoped it would be and more! I couldn't be happier with it. (well except I felt that Jason's character was underdeveloped and piper seemed a little shallow by judging everyone's relationships) but I'm okay with that. The beginning is right where they left off and the percabeth reunion was so great I cried. The ending was the only thing I can't decide how I feel about... I'm either mad or sad about it (vague spoiler) I'm mad because after everything they have gone through they now have to go through the worst experience ever and maybe lose their minds and die. I'm sad because it was really sad but overall I did love the ending as sad and angry as it made me feel. It's the best in the series so far and like please read it if you haven't. I really want the next one to come out. like right now. seriously I can't take it it's been like four hours since I finished and I can't wait.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Our soon to be three-year-old granddaughter is obsessed with this movie (I took her to see it EIGHT times in the movie theatre).  You can imagine what it means to her to be able to watch it at will.  The best part is that I'm not bored with it yet myself.  Just watching Merida's hair and imagining how that was created in the studio is worth the price of the DVD.  The story itself is spellbinding for all ages.  Just a great all-round movie.
B002PNER9U|5.0|Heart breaking and life affirming at the same time.  This has already made it into the 'classic' category as far as I'm concerned.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Game is too ooo oo oo sloo oo oo oow in between drawings. It gets booo ooo ring after awhile.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fear as a control technique, fear as a motivator, fear as a builder of walls around hearts. The hunger games may bring the lack of food into the forefront, but the real hunger is for freedom, truth, and love.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|If you have an Android tablet you will want this and need this. Great way to look at your files, and clean out the unwanted files from browsing. Also allows you to relocate files to a preferred storage area.
B003ZEQMIC|1.0|I haven't watched the movie... because like the others, I can't.  The disc ONLY includes the special features.  DO NOT order this product.  And no, inspecting the disc won't clue you in - the package is only built for one disc and the disc itself simply has the movie title on it.  After spending 15 minutes wondering whether I was insane as I tried to find where the movie was, I at least take consolation knowing I'm not the only one.
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|The movie sets up well: people in the future kill others by sending them back to the past to be shot and incinerated by contracted killers. Problem is it looks much better in theory than application. Acting in the movie is okay, but the overall story has too many problems. Bruce Willis was pretty decent, but his younger version was acted unevenly. Film editing was poor:<br />Young Willis is right-handed while old Willis is left-handed.<br />Someone is shot in the neck in one scene, but OK in the following scene.<br /><br />If I could I would give the movie two-and-a-half stars.
B000W745CU|5.0|Speedy and accurate service. I will do business in the future with this merchant. Could not have asked for better timing.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Really fun, lots of challenges, and great comical features on the characters faces. Can be a little frustrating when the right color bubbles aren't available but till fun.
B002NZK5TG|5.0|I love this movie. My mom and I watched it together when I was younger and I have loved it ever since.
B0086700CM|4.0|Fast and furious.....have to be quick to play this game. I'm just learning this game, I jump when I should turn. Have to laugh at myself when I jump over the wall to my death, but then get another chance at life....
034580404X|2.0|A porn book-does not have anything I would recomend, I read it hoping the books would get better-last book a little better.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I have been reading Clancy for year.  Clark and Ryan were classic characters especially going back to Patriot Games and Without Remorse.  While it is fun to see these characters continue on, it just feel like a stretch to keep them going.  The writing style, classic details and character depth no longer feel like standard Clancy.<br /><br />The story line around Jack Jr has potential, but it falls short.  If you are a Clancy fan then you will feel like this falls short of doing his characters true justice, if you are not familiar with their backgrounds this book may be more enjoyable. Worth reading, but not one I would return to like previous novels.
B002XTXG1G|5.0|love the movie but enjoy how Tom Hardy shows he is a great actor and gets into his role worth buying and watching
B006LSZECO|2.0|This was a dumb book with way too much profanity for no apparent reason.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B004EPZ07K|2.0|even tho it was a okay shot of the Green lantern super hero the movie was weak but i am a super hero fan so i got it .
B005LAIISA|5.0|I bought this for my Grandson, but I think my adult daughter enjoyed it just as much as my Grandson!  It's very cute;  for &#34;kids&#34; of all ages.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Michael Jackson's music is the classic! I especially like the song &#34;I'm so blue&#34;. And the CD3 gives me a chance to just listen to his show when I don't have time to watch it! LOVE IT
B003XT603Q|4.0|Murakami is amazing.  He writes with such ease you just read everything quickly.  The love story in this book is not a typical one.  Its sad but beautiful at the same time.  I recommend it for people who know Murakami's style, they will not be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is really good it keeps you guess what going to happen next. You can't put it down . It took me 4 days to read this is was just really good . I loved it so much I can't wait to watch the movie coming out in November .I hope it is as good as the book. I think teens should read it the most I am one , and I loved it so I hope every one who reads it will like it too.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Since I already owned all the movies on DVD my main reasons for picking up this set were 1) Blu Ray  2) Cool Packaging.<br />The packaging is exceedingly well-done. Looks SUPER, HIGH QUALITY CONSTRUCTION, and a nice HEFT to the package.<br />And the $30 pricetag was quite reasonable. The running time of the Special Features far exceeds the movie ( in this case<br />Alien ) and I began to wonder if it would ever end ! :o) The same holds true for the other Featurettes. BUY THIS !
B000VYX8PE|5.0|It has a twist and a humorous  author plus more books in the series.<br /><br />By vera Snodgrass reader by heart
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|First off let me say that The Franchise continues to milk Star Trek  for every last drop it can get. My devotion to the show is the only thing which allowed me to shell out 200 clams. Overall the Picture quality and the new effects are great. However I am<br />disappointed that they chose to use 4:3 instead of the much better 16:9. And they rub your nose in it 'cuz much of the series<br />footage seen in the Special Features DOES USE 16:9 :o(  Boooooooooo ! Hisssssssssss!
1594487154|5.0|This is not a book for salespeople. This is a book for ALL people.<br /><br />Daniel Pink is a great author and this very though provoking book provides very insightful help in how to interact, communicate and understand.<br /><br />You can keep doing what you're doing and continue getting the same results. Or, you could buy this book, read it, implement it and.....<br /><br />How do you know you don't need it?
B009EANE3M|3.0|I see they experimented with the rap side of music. I prefer the first two this this one though. Their 2008 self-titled was great. This is usually not my type of music but Variety is the spice of life
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Definitely recommend this book to anyone! Best romance I have read in a while! Love Nicholas Sparks books!!!!!!!
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|This is really suprisingly good and pretty heavy...I don't even know who to compare it to. It's kinda like P!nk though.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Just started using this a few days ago, and really like it.  I am just getting used to the setup, but very glad I bought it.<br />I'm using it mainly for FPS games, and specifically Borderlands 2.  I will update once I use more, but at this price, I don't think you can go wrong.  The size is fantastic, and it's very solid. So far, I would highly recommend.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I first tried this game as a demo on the Wii and loved it. Now I can enjoy the full version right on my phone!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun game to play (very addictive) but has too many ads that interrupt your game.  I have learned how to get past them quickly but they are still a pain.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This app is good but has frequent connection problems. Although the app states it will reinstate credits, it does not.
1573301183|4.0|My boyfriend loved it. He is a musician and really likes a lot of the songs on this cd. Great to watch!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Extremely funny and good singing. The cast is awesome and Rebel Wilson does an amazing job as Fat Amy. Definitely worth watching!
B000YABS8E|5.0|Makes you think about how society has changed over time.  I have watched this many times and always enjoy it.
B008J34466|5.0|I purchased this CD as one of the Christmas gifts for my wife and she loves it. I can honestly say that I'm enjoying it too. It was priced just right and shipped expeditiously as stated.
0765325950|5.0|Well, what can I say this book has exceeded my expectations? Throughout its many pages I have experienced many emotions including joy, anger, angst, anticipation and sorrow.  It has brought together all of the books of the series and culminated into the end of a journey which I have enjoyed partaking in for the last 23 years.  I have felt joy at the loss of some who I was glad to see go, sorrow over those who I was saddened to lose and bewildered over those whose absence was inconspicuously missing.  I have cried, laughed and cursed Jordan's and Sanderson's name throughout this book.  But thankfully by the time I read the last word, I was happy I started this journey.  I am sorry to see it go but what else can I say but WELL DONE TEAM JORDAN, THANK YOU FOR THE RIDE!!<br /><br />EDIT: I would like to add something to this.  I do not understand why there are some who are giving low ratings on the book based on the fact the ebook will not be released for 3 months.  While I do not understand how that should impact the review of the book, I also do not understand how soon readers, those who started reading this series in the very beginning, are forgetting the 9 month to a year delay between the release of the hardback and the paperback volumes of the book.  A 3 month delay is nothing to whine over.  And yes I will be one who will be purchasing the ebook as a pre-order as soon as it is available.
B000SEIDR0|3.0|This book is loaded with great information about our food sources. I do think, however, that the same information could have been written in a much more condensed version.
B0087HT36U|5.0|Got this game for my grandkids and my husband  is now addicted to it ! Can't wait for more levels to be released !

B007SGM084|4.0|I'm glad I bought the trilogy bundle so I could read them in order and continue the storyline. In my opinion, there has been too much hype re this book series.  Yes, there is a LOT OF EROTIC SEX, however, some parts are actually boring because there are too many repeated episodes. The descriptions of the various types of sex acts may be disturbing to a person who has had a &#34;sheltered upbringing&#34;. I, personally, have not read much of this genre of writing; however, I had at least heard of most acts described.<br /><br />Books two and three state in the opening publication information that the story was previously published as a series entitled, &#34;Master of the Universe&#34;.  The author is British and perhaps the series appeared in magazines on the more liberal continent (Europe)?<br /><br />E.L. James was interviewed by Katic Couric and the author used &#34;love story&#34; to describe her series...I would have to agree with that view. I have yet to finish the third book but it's basically been a &#34;guy meets girl, guy wants girl, girl wants guy, they get it on, guy loses girl...&#34;  no spoiler alert here! James' storyline is interesting, but I wish there were more of it.
B000EQ4G5K|5.0|This is the second Rihanna album that I have purchased. My first was Loud. I had expected this ablum to be a bit less than the first, but was happily surprised that it is every bit as good as the first album. I have already enjoyed listening to it several times, and will continue to do so.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|New Year's Eve with a massive line up of household name actors is such a letdown due to the fact they are all playing characters we already know them as, just with different names. Lithgow pretty much just replayed Dr Dick Solomon from 3rd Rock from the Sun.  Lea Michele's character Elise might have well have just been named Rachel as she was exactly the same as that character from Glee, even singing a duet song as Bon Jovi does his side of it in a kitchen miles away while she's stuck in an elevator. If the plot had just said Rachel Berry got a gig to back up Jensen and got stuck in an elevator this could have been an episode of Glee.  Why get Jon Bon Jovi to play a singer?  Gee what a stretch for him.  He's been trying to become an actor for a few decades now, if he can't play anything but a face for the same old same old written female character to fall in love with or a singer, in this case both, then it's time to maybe stick to being in a rock band Jon. Hiegel played the same character we've seen over and over again in her movies since she left Grey's Anatomy. Why not have Jon playing Ashton Kutcher's character or John Lithgow's and have one of them be the singer instead?  Would have provided a bit of an acting challenge for everyone?  Kutcher as the guy who has let himself go by growing a beard and wearing pyjamas outside his apartment is just playing whatever his character's name was who replaced Charlie Sheen in Two and a Half Men which was based on Kelso from That 70s Show to begin with. Ava was just Gloria from Modern Family, complete with the over the top exaggerated mispronunciations of the English language written for Gloria.  I like that character but if I'm watching Sofia Vergara in something that isn't Modern Family I want to believe her next line isn't going to be Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyy! I don't understand why any of these actors took these roles, the thing history has taught us, is to cash in on your fame while you've got a huge fan base from your popular TV show and film investors chasing ticket sales are prepared to cast you, play something completely different so when that show ends you aren't typecast.<br /><br />There's some plot spoilers in the rest of this review if you choose to keep reading. The only decent acting was from Abigail Breslin playing the daughter who is the victim of an overprotective paranoid parent played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  However she had a very poor script to follow, it's unlikely in the real world an older teenager so determined to want to spend New Year's Eve with her friends wouldn't argue it a bit more forcibly when you're actually in Manhattan rather than go home and sneak out your bedroom window (where Hollywood style we don't ever have security screens let alone fly screens making this possible) so early in the day you know you're mother will find out anyway. Plus when you see your boyfriend kissing some other girl from your school in a lengthy kiss you'd have to be an absolute idiot to just take them back.  Even if she believed he didn't instigate it, he didn't push the other girl away at any time either.  Parker as the paranoid parent plays that well, but being the one a much younger Josh Duhamel is pushing away beautiful girls his own age throwing themselves at him to see again is a bit of a stretch. Even if you buy that, how did she organise a horse drawn carriage in a few minutes and why even bother before you know if he is even there being that you haven't even left your daughter at least half an hour after the scheduled meeting time.<br /><br />Other than Breslin, surprisingly it was Zac Efron that was one of the only other actors who provided a bit of acting away from his normal role, along with Michelle Pfeiffer who he as a courier decides to help have a sort of midlife crisis revelation and start to live life possibly for her first time ever.  Deniro as a lonely dyeing patient was also good as was Halle Berry as his nurse.  But really everyone else just replayed characters they play in sitcoms making the overall viewing experience very predictable and disappointing. This movie has an opportunity to be something great with the cast that signed on, it's a shame they obviously couldn't afford any decent writers or couldn't be bothered as they knew fans of those celebrities would watch this anyway. Possibly the actors themselves don't have the ability to play anything beyond what they already do. Who knows, give this one a miss!yed characters they play in sitcoms making the overall viewing experience very predictable and disappointing.

B00APUYN0I|4.0|There were a couple of scenes that were bordering on inappropriate considering the audience it's geared towards, but overall it was a good message.
B007SGM084|5.0|First, let me say that this book set has helped my husband and I greatly in and out of the bedroom (Not that is was bad, it just needed spice).  We have been married for 16 years and our sex life has never been better than it is now. I loved the story line, but the grammar and repetitiveness of the choice in words was annoying.  That said, I would recommend this book to anyone who needs to spice up their marriage.
B00APUTEBG|1.0|Poor acting, thin plot, slow moving, bad story line. Not worth the time or money.  Bruce Willis does in the fist few scenes and your left with a wannabe tough guy.  Boring.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Forget everything you think this book will be about. It surpasses it all. A page turner. I couldn't put it down! I can't wait to read the next 2!
B004L03B3S|3.0|I thought the subject was interesting and the movie was good..but nothing spectacular. Lead actors are handsome and they seemed to really connect in their scenes.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|so addicting- i keep playing,trying to get 3 stars everytime<br /> great if you have time and want to challenge yourself
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9y/o son has been talking about this game for months that he plays w/his friends on their gadgets.  He loves this game and steals my Kindle to play it.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Flawless play. If you enjoy solitare, you'll love Spider. Great graphics and smooth play. I<br />highly recommend this game. enjoy
0307887448|5.0|This is very accesible sci-fi, and will probably be my new top choice for people just starting out in the genre. I love the mix of vintage pop references with interesting near-term sci-fi concepts. My only disappointment in the book was finding out that this is Ernest Cline's first novel! I look forward to reading more Ernest, keep it up!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|The first Imagine Dragons song I heard was It's Time and I was instantly hooked, so i decided to buy the CD, and I got it cheap, I haven't been able to stop listening to the CD since i got it, everyone should buy this CD
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|Take a little Coen Brothers, a bit of Jim Thompson's &#34;The Killer Inside Me&#34;, a slice  of &#34;Lolita&#34;, some good old fashioned gratuitous sexuality and violence, some nice ensemble acting and Viola! - You've got Killer Joe.  Enjoy this wholesome family movie.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|I really liked this movie despite its predictable plot. Clint is the consummate cranky old guy, fighting technology with life experience and wisdom. The father/daughter dynamics kept me engaged, as did the unfolding romance.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I found this book exciting. It had just enough romance mixed in with rough and tough guy stuff to be good conversation peace with the men in my life.  It was there recommendation that I read it.  Looking forward to completing the series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was against reading the hunger games trilogy because it doesn't seem like my kind of reading. However, I saw the movie first and then was very intrigued.  The first book was amazing so I knew reading the second was inevitable. I couldn't stop turning the pages. An easy, fun and tantalizing read for sure. I'm hooked! Onto book 3!
037571457X|5.0|this is another easy to read book- this is about the 1979 Iranian revolution- an easy read and unfortunately I had already seen the movie so it was pretty easy to know what was coming but it was very good and I love that Professors are starting to use this in Universities...
B007FEFLTO|5.0|A great historical novel.  I like the way Follett covers WWII from almost all sides and does not get caught up in minutia.
030758836X|5.0|This intricately plotted novel begins as a compelling read and becomes downright compulsive. The ending strains plausibility but is no less enjoyable and satisfying. It is, like its title character, dazzling and clever and fluid in its assumptions. Its masterful use of the unreliable narrator should be studied in writing workshops.
1849904251|5.0|BOUGHT THIS BOOK FOR MY 21 YR.<br />OLD OBSESSED DAUGHTER. IT DIDN'T<br />LET HER DOWN AND MADE MOM LOOK GOOD.:)<br />INTERESTING, DETAILED, LOVE THE PHOTOS AND<br />ILLUSTRATIONS.
1423124111|5.0|Beautiful and extremely well crafted.  Authors did a fantistic job of reasearch and putting all together in a nice package of very entertaining and visually stunning chronology.
B004RC8NUQ|5.0|It is a very good movie full of funny moments, romance and the most important it is easy to watch! I love it!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I'm not picky.  I just wanted a calculator.  This one works great on my kindle hd.  The only thing is I wish it came in different color options.  That's not a big deal though.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The story line is fantastic. The hero is ordinary and overcomes many challenges. It is full of suspense and keeps your interested.<br />Highly recommended.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved every page. Beautifully written and very heartwarming. I could not put it down. I cannot wait to read Point of Retreat.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Have seen the old movie many times and it's great but the book goes into the deeper feelings of hope and faith. It's just wonderful.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Charges faster than cable that came with my phone. This is for both my Samsung SIII as well as Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;. Love it.
B009GESJH2|2.0|I miss old Kid rock! This album sounds that same as the last two. The album isn't bad but I don't feel like their is anything<br />interesting about it. I don't know, If you like country  Kid rock then you might think its ok.
B00000ITOY|5.0|My 1 year old LOVES triangles. All shapes but triangles are his favorite. And he loves taking this apart and lining them all up. I should have gotten it when he turned 1...but still gets lot of use out of it.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a great story and a really enjoyable read. Who thought been stuck on Mars would be so entertaining...<br />Wonder when his next book will be out.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Great movies. Great delivery time. Great condition. Everything arrived on time and in great condition from UPS. I was very excited to give this great deal to my husband for Christmas this year! P.S.-he loved it!
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee is an amazingly strong woman. It wasn't easy reading what she lived through (I almost couldn't get through the first 20%) but her strength, resilience and positive outlook really amaze me.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|I bought this movie thinking I was in for something a little more interesting than I received. The plot is not really linear, but I think that is typical with most scifi movies. There was a bit of suspense in the movie. I liked the movie, but I wouldn't suggest adding this one to your dvd/blu ray collection because I don't think it is worth watching more than once.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|The book itself is a good read, but the Kindle version has had a hard time downloading on my iPad.
1469984202|5.0|such a great piece of science fiction (read the 5 in 1 book for kindle)!!  fingers are crossed we'll see this on the big screen sometime in the future!  bigger than Hunger Games i bet!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Lived in Den Haag, The Netherlands for three years and the descriptions were so good I felt that I had returned to the scene of the crime.<br /><br />Being an Expat Wife, I was amazed that the author could describe the situation so well .. being a man .. sorry to be so chauvinist.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book. Although the ending was too abrupt for me. But I guess that's the plan to keep you reading. This will make an awesome movie for those who like the movies rather than reading the book. Now on to book 3!
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Read this book because a good friend and avid reader said it was his favorite book.  I now need to see the movie. I think I got the connections but it is work to figure it all out.  Still so very original in material and form.
B004U5WZG8|5.0|A friend on facebook shared her music with me and I just loved it.  I bought 2 one for me and one for my daughter. We both love the CD's.  She is amazing.  Two females one 18 and one 55, and we both love her music.  We rec'd the order promptly with no trouble.
B008C40218|4.0|I like this C.D. because it is fiercely independent and non-commercial music. I like both the lyrics and the music.
B00479SVBU|4.0|I am very pleased with this Soundfly MP3 Player the SD fits perfectly inside the player, unlike other MP3 players, that go only half way in. The only displeasing thing about this product is that the display screen scratches and I can't see the words. I have tried bright up the screen to the max but  still having difficulties with it. But the rest of the product is PERFECT!!!
1451695195|2.0|Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon, so it should come as no surprise that he displays the level of arrogance he does in his account of his NDE.  My impression throughout is that because he says it, the neurosurgeon after all, everyone should now accept and believe and the question of NDEs being &#34;real&#34; is settled.  But he is simply another NDEer wowed by his own experience offering nothing new in terms of the experience.  And while all the medical information might convince another neurosurgeon, it means little to the layperson. There is no &#34;proof&#34; here and neither the writer nor his story is particularly interesting.  It's a ten page NDE account padded into a 171 page book with 25 pages of reference stuff stuck on the end.  IMO, anyone looking for a serious NDE read can skip this one.

B0014NDXGA|5.0|I was greatly surprised at the quality of service I got, I would highly recommend shopping with amazon It was my first time but it will not be my last. My package arrived on time in perfect condition and a great price. The product was all it promised and more.
B00008G8M3|5.0|for the year, good effects, story line.  Explosions, flying saucers.  humor of Will Smith.  Coolness of Bill Pullmand and Jeff Goldblum
B000000SDB|4.0|Everyone's imagination is different. Tempi as well as the level of ability of orchestral players was so different when this was written, All we can do is listen to our preferences today. Sometimes it fails, sometimes it succeeds. I love that we are all listening.
B0091TGWYE|1.0|I really wanted this to work. But like other reviewers I got my phone STUCK and the strap thing to pull it out did not work. I waited a week and thought I'd try again, maybe it was me. Not me. Horrible purchase. The phone was so stuck and like other reviewers I was afraid I would damage the phone.

B0017VG69U|2.0|I bought this remastered season of star trek and I think it's really good excellent work, however I did see a few mistakes paramount made on the episode \\"Assignment Earth\\" the control room scene is fuzzy with static were they forgot to digitally clean it up and there was some view screen scenes where you can see black specks and a scene where the elevator is going up the rocket and you can see mud on the camera.

142313866X|5.0|My Daughter showed interest in this book while we were on vacation in Disneyland, I was smart and took a picture of the cover when she walked away and surprised her with it for her birthday a few months later. THe animation and the history behind the animation is fantastic. Even for a person who isn't an artist there is lots of interesting content.
0385341008|5.0|I bought the book for a Book Club discussion without the faintist clue as to the subject or style. Once I got into the quick switches from 1 letter to another, I became fascinated with the history of the area after the war and thought the authors' descriptions of the characters was exspressed well for the reader to pick up on. We will discuss it at our meeting next week. It will be interesting to hear the comments of women younger than those of us whose fathers were involved, and see how they view the &#34;sneaky&#34;, inventive ways that the islanders handled their &#34;guests&#34;. Very interesting human study.
B007USWCXS|5.0|It takes alot these days for me to fall in love with a film but that is just what I did with the French film Le Havre (2011). The film was directed by Finnish director Aki Kaurismaki who also directed The Man Without a Past (2002). It is a story, or possibly a fable, about an immigrant African boy who becomes stranded in the French shipping port of Havre on the coast where the Seine river meets the English Channel. He was on his way to London, hiding in a cargo container, when the police opened it up and he ran away. The whole story then becomes about an eldery man, Marcel Marx, played by Andre Wilms, who, once was a Bohemian writer, possibly in Paris, now works as a shoe shiner around the train station. He befriends the boy, named Idrissa, and he, along with his neighborhood friends, make it their purpose to get this boy to London anyway they can. Meanwhile, Marcel's wife Arletty has become critically ill and is in the hospital for treatments. It is a simple yet poignant story of what can get accomplished when people work together for a common good. The highlight for me was when the neighborhood puts on a benefit concert starring a man named Little Bob who comes out of retirement to rock and roll. It is a beautiful and funny scene. The cinematography is somewhat muted and we see the pale rainbow colors of the homes and the slow and steady lifestyle of the people in neighborhood each one accepting each others talents, faults and idiosyncracies. I usually prefer films with quick and original dialogue but with Le Havre I just sat back and relaxed and wished I lived in one of the tiny homes while enjoying the little things that life has to offer.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|not much to say besides the fact that this was A GREAT book !!<br />the ending will knock your socks off<br />I can not wait for the movie in Feb :)
0446580848|2.0|My first DeMille book was 'The Charm School'. I thought it was one of the best books I had ever read. Then 'Plumb Island'. Again a great book. The 'Panther' had no action.  Page after page of descriptions.  Nothing.  Sad. Don't waste your time.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I started watching season 1 through netflix and got instantly hooked. Though I didn't really understand how they would keep the story going much longer than 4 episodes much less several seasons, but as it went along the twists and turns were amazing. The additional characters are making for a wonderful story to evolve. Loving every minute!
B000683VI4|5.0|Sweet, great acting, warm story of love lost and love found. Will watch it again.  A film for the whole family.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I like it fine. There have been no adverse issues noted. Galaxy Tab 2, 7.0. Does what it is supposed to.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|My son now gets up for school on his own...it's great! We set it to go on every weekday. He also loves that it tells him the weather.
B009E9QOEO|5.0|Incredible freakin' album.  I've been a long time Led Zep fan (I bought the first album the day it came out, 1968?), but as with any long time love, at times you fail to recognize it's beauty.  Hearing this phenomenal concert with the band once again at full prowess, just plain ol' filled me with passion for their music again.  The blues riffs are just unbelieveable!  Can't stop listening!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son loves Star Wars and loves angry birds. This combines both and he absolutely loves it. The music and graphics are very authentic
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Smart storyline and well developed characters. Great casting. My one complaint is the unnecessary sex and language that is off putting especially in the first 3 episodes. Then it seems to taper off.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|What a intriguing and wonderful story. Who knows how different the world would have been if JFK was not assassinated.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had not read a book in about ten years and I could not stop reading these.I actually miss the characters now that I am done.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Well written and nearly impossible to put down.  The story deepens and gets more complicated, and I was more impressed with the plotting in this one...some nice surprises and some unrecognized seeds near the beginning bear fruit later.  Can't wait to read the finale!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Loved the story line and characters! Amy was a good but crazy inspiration to ppl that even the best people have dark sides
1423165691|5.0|I bought this for my husband, who is an illustrator. He loves it! Great source of inspiration.<br />The book is laid out exactly like an artist sketchbook. Some sketches have little notes beside them. Disney hit a home run with this!

B00013M6NK|3.0|This battery is better than the after-market add-on I got when I bought the camera new.<br />It properly fits the camera, and does not seem to age like the after-market product.<br />The Nikon batteries also seem to hold their charge longer, and last longer while in use.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This  game has many different types of puzzles to solve, some are easy and some are very challenging.  The tiles are easy to read and match.
1569242739|3.0|The book is beautiful and true to what it is suppose to be. I love cupcakes and think it's great that we can make them vegan. In being honest though I found the recipes difficult and called for ingredients not often used. It is good for a true vegan but my failed attempt means this book will have to collect dust till I am motivated to make a true commitment to being vegan.
B008TTPQXA|5.0|I really liked this book.  First because he is a neurosurgeon so knows his way around the brain and my husband had a life after life experience not as Eben had, but still he had one so I understood his experience a little more.  It also give one thought that yes maybe there is something after this life here.

B004OC07GM|5.0|Really interesting book about how companies are unable to compete with small upstarts that change their value chain. The book chronicles the history of multiple industries, including the hard drive industry and describes how big companies are unable to develop products that cannibalize their own margins, even though that is exactly what they're new competitors are doing.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|I got it for my son who loves this show for Christtmas. The price was right for me to get 5 and 6.

B002B0FLOM|4.0|Though record companies probably hate it, Neil Young's unpredictability remains one of his greatest strengths. Over a vast career his sound has varied from the grungiest sandpaper against concrete distorted and passionate rocking dirges to shockingly beautiful slow ballads. Fans seem to accept the persistent swings in energy, sound and approach. And though Young occasionally drops a dud, his far more prevalent strong material makes up for any slips.<br /><br />\\"Comes A Time\\" is definitely no dud. It features Young sounding mostly introspective and longing as acoustic guitars, fiddles, banjo and other electric sounds create a relaxing leaning on a chair on the porch feeling. Sometimes the music evokes images of tree-filled landscapes in full bloom. The album overall feels like a walk through a quiet green meadow.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"Goin' Back,\\" sets this mood with delicate guitar, strings and some electric buzzing instrument that, though somewhat bizarre, also works incredibly well for emphasis. The chorus, \\"I feel like goin' back, back where there's no where to stay\\" sounds both cryptic and familiar. The mellow music and abstract lyrics combine in a surrealistically gorgeous way that stays somewhat ineffable even after numerous listens. Though the words do suggest a melancholy desire to return to life in a pre-industrial state.<br /><br />Most of the album preserves this irresistible mood. \\"Comes A Time\\" suggests the miraculous inevitability of day to day existence: \\"This old world keeps turning round / It's a wonder tall tree ain't layin' down\\" and \\"that's how we kept what we gave away.\\" A surprising appearance of distorted electric guitar at one point mimicking windshield wipers, doesn't alter the mood at all during \\"Look Out For My Love.\\" If anything, it intensifies it. Even \\"Lotta Love,\\" which some strangely consider one of Young's weaker songs, keeps the mood going with its sparse arrangement of guitar, bass, piano and drums. Many likely heard also this song in its far more orchestrated and upbeat Nicolette Larson permutation that climbed the charts in 1978 and 1979.<br /><br />Lap steel and strings beautifully undergird \\"Peace of Mind.\\" This atmospheric song almost creates a sensation of floating on one's back in a placid pool. \\"Human Highway\\" explodes with folk and country of a Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie type. \\"How can people get so unkind\\" reverberates endlessly even after the first listen. \\"Already One\\" brings the album back to the mood of \\"Goin' Back\\" and \\"Peace of Mind\\" before \\"Field Of Opportunity\\" rosins the fiddle bows for a redux of \\"Comes A Time\\" and \\"Human Highway.\\"<br /><br />Then the strange and somewhat incongruous \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" gurgles into the serene landscape. Here Young once again becomes unpredictable within an otherwise consistent collection of songs. This one definitely stands out with its defiant stuck in the dirt imagery and churning electric guitar. And Nicolette Larson, who covered \\"Lotta Love,\\" takes a few verses. The fiddles and electric guitar work surprisingly well together here. Then the album returns to mountains, trees and greenery and some melancholy with \\"Four Strong Winds,\\" a rare Young cover song by Canadian singer Ian Tyson.<br /><br />\\"Comes A Time\\" often gets compared to Young's highly acclaimed \\"Harvest\\" album, but the comparison really doesn't stand. This album more resembles the later \\"Old Ways,\\" though it's much stronger overall and not quite as doused in mainstream country sounds. Those looking for rocking grungy Neil, side two of \\"Rust Never Sleeps,\\" will not find it here at all, with the slight exception of \\"Motorcycle Mama,\\" but that's even relatively toned down. But those seeking the more mellow and ruminating Neil, side one of \\"Rust Never Sleeps,\\" need look no further. Put it on and head for the hills.this song in its far more orchestrated and upbeat Nicolette Larson permutation that climbed the charts in 1978 and 1979.<br /><br />Lap steel and strings beautifully undergird \\"Peace of Mind.\\" This atmospheric song almost creates a sensation of floating on one's back in a placid pool. \\"Human Highway\\" explodes with folk and country of a Lead Belly and Woody Guthrie type. \\"How can people get so unkind\\" reverberates endlessly even after the first listen. \\"Already One\\" brings the album back to the mood of \\"Goin' Back\\" and \\"Peace of Mind\\" before \\"Field Of Opportunity\\" rosins the fiddle bows for a redux of \\"Comes A Time\\" and \\"Human Highway.\\"<br /><br />Then the strange and somewhat incongruous \\"Motorcycle Mama\\" gurgles into the serene landscape.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|The sorry is well written and very addictive. The only annoying thing is that it looks like it might take a while before we see the next part on the market
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app makes it easy to check the forecast without getting bogged down in weather news! A great time saver.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I'll watch most things sci-fi, so therefore it gets a 3 from me - would give it a 2 otherwsie. There were hardly any surprises in this film and the acting was just so-so. The premise (send people to the past for execution) was preposterous.
0547884591|5.0|This book is not just about cooking, it is about a mentality about cooking, I love it, I love the stories, the side notes the ideas.  I bought it for a friend of mine who doesn't cook and he is making the recipes in it, after only a week.

B006BXTOFC|4.0|This cd is well worth the money! I really like their bluesy style that they put onto provide a different rock
B007L6VR6M|5.0|I normally have a no-movie-buying policy.  I love movies, but I don't need physical copies of them cluttering up the house.  Downloads are too easily available, without any storage issues.  But in this case, my son fell in love with this movie in the theater, and I loved that this is the first movie he truly loved.  So this was a Christmas gift, and a much appreciated one.  The fact that I broke the house rule for it made the gift doubly sweet.  Kind of like the treat of getting to stay up past your bedtime (reason alone to have a strict bedtime).
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I received a Kindle for Christmas and in searching for my first book, Wonder popped up. It looked interesting so i purchased this story. It is a heart-warming story and an easy read. I love that little boy, Auggie.<br />At the time i ordered it, i didn't know it was a young person read, but, i am glad to have read it. You forget how rough it is being a kid growing up let alone having your appearance be the main issue.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|thought provoking!  The author's background gives weight to his experiences.  I found it a good read and encouraging.  worth the read

B003TSDI0E|5.0|I read another book by Jostein Gaarder (The Christmas Mystery) & decided to check out this book immediately after.  I found both books quiet enjoyable, but quite different.  This book plays with the imagination of the reader & tickles the mind.  A fun intro to philosophy.
B00555X8OA|4.0|Coming from hard, mathematical, economics background, utilising ideas of pure reasoning, this book and the ideas behind 2002 Nobel are well worth reading to provide somewhat different view. After all, everything is not so rational after all.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Can't say too much about this, it does give a good weather report, and a 10 day forecast. Nice to have.
B004IEA2MU|4.0|A good refresher on game theory. Although this was required reading at the university on the courses I took (at that time it was called &#34;Thinking Strategically&#34;), after passing courses with &#34;hard mathematics&#34; on the subject of game theory, I would say that this book provides 75% to 90% of knowledge on the subject with 10% of effort for the most people.
B004SD5GZ4|3.0|This ap is some what slow, to me. I use it on my phone with no problems. The jury is still out that's why I gave it a 3 star (couldn't give it a 2 1/2). Will check it out later to see if it does better.
B000O75F7C|5.0|Perfect album. Great balance between songs. The instrumentation and sound quality are just what you'd expect from Wilson and company.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This is a must have, have it on my phone and it is a great help for recording things. No more lists when I go out shopping I just pull out my phone and everything I need to do/get is right there. So on my kindle only makes it better, easier to see. lol
B0058WFO06|5.0|This is one long beautiful album with such musical variety and interesting experimentation. Great price for a 2-CD package too.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Like all of Brandon Sanderson books, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. His magic systems are always so innovative and even believable. I don't know why I didn't give this 5 stars - maybe because it was too short, or just because we didn't have quite enough time to establish any relationships or sympathies/hates with anyone but the main character. Yet I would highly recommend this book - I just loved reading it.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Right, two huge egos making music that is &#34;not for the masses&#34;. If you have appreciation for musical experimentation and expect nothing from it, you will find yourself liking it more and more with every listen.<br />Nothing like their respective bands, that's for sure.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This version is easy to read, in modern English! It is so easy to look up the study notes and/or cross references by just touching the icon on the Kindle screen. I look forward to reading it each day and I can take it with me where ever I go!

B005LAII80|4.0|I HAVE BEEN DUPED! I am very upset with Lionsgate, and Vudu. I bought this to support the movie and watch it in 3D again. The only reason I shelled out the money was because they said you get a digital edition, I don't even own a blu ray player, never had a need because I am all digital. I assumed that because I payed extra for a 3d blu ray I would have recieved the 3d digital edition. I ASSUMED WRONG. Do not make my mistake. DO watch this awesome under rated movie!

B003TSEEDY|3.0|I remember reading this book when I was in middle school. I remember that I liked it a lot back then. However, I am now a senior in college and didn't like it as much this time around. I felt like a 14 year old girl reading this book. Was a very easy read. I recommend this book for young teens.
B0015DROBO|5.0|friends recommended the book. It was written like you were there. Would recommend it to anyone. Coouldn't  put it down
4898153194|5.0|This is one of those books that you pick up, browse the photos (I don't read Japanese), put down and pick up again and again. The shipping was rapid for the miles it had to travel and arrived well wrapped and protected. Those who love animals will not be disappointed with the financial investment to get this little book across the globe into your home. It is a treasure for everyone who has loved and animal and loved a grandparent and loved an aging parent. Priceless.

B00ABXA1HI|5.0|I love the app on my Kindle Fire HD. It works flawlessly and I can see everything on the computer very cleanly. It is  fast and simple process to set up. The only thing I do not like is that you have to pay a monthly or yearly fee to use the service if you are not on your network.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|It gets hairy when there is a lot going on, many customers and food to be served! My daughters and I challenged each other each time we play. Diner Dash is a bit better but this serves it entertainment purpose.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|First my Steely Dan credentials that allow me to write a review about this CD.  I bought Prezel Logic in 1976, which started my Dan collection that has come to encompass pretty much everything they have put out, including Fagen's solo albums.  I saw them in concert on the Art Crimes and EMG tours.<br /><br />I admit up front that Aja is not my favorite and I am not as crazy about the jazz influence on Fagen as many of the reviewers here are.  I didn't enjoy Morph the Cat at all except for What I Do--obviously not jazz.  I was afraid, after the first listening, that I would feel the same about Sunken Condos.  BUT, after listening to it a number of times, I have found 4 songs I really, really like--yeah, they aren't the jazz ones.  I love these:  1) I'm not the Same Without You, 2) Weather in my Head, 3) Out of the Ghetto, 4) Miss Marlene.  These songs are now in my head constantly.  I went back and listened to Kamikiriad too, and found I like these songs better than most of the songs on that CD also (I like Tomorrow's Girls and On the Dunes the most from that CD). Nightfly will always be the best, though the title song is my least favorite on it.<br /><br />Here is my take.  I like the soul/blues/rock side of Fagen the best.  I don't like the lyrics much in the jazzy songs--too much story telling, too complex.  That's just personal.  I am sure others like that.  I don't like the jazz songs that seem like Fagen is more interested in the sounds of the instruments (jazz again) rather than a good tight song.<br /><br />Just my opinions.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|I love this movie! I recommend watching the special features on how they made it. It is amazing! I love the political satire...
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This is probably my favorite book ever.  I don't know how many times I've read it, but I love it more every time I read it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is the top of the line quality for a wholesome, good ole movie with Christian values and morals. Alex Kendrick writing was sensational, emotional-gripping, and spiritual moving with a hint of action, family values, and comedy with drama all in one package. He gave just enough dose where you laughed, you cried, and you smiled, or tugging at your heart but you learned the most important value: men to rise to their rightful place as the Bible commands them. More importantly, others to hold them accountable and to enrich these values in their children, and other children who may have lost a parent or doesn't have a guardian at all. Thank you! I even encouraged my father to watch it and make such a vow unto God. And raise up daughters to be respectful young ladies and know what to see in their future husband because of looking at their greatest role model: their dad who exemplifies Christ.<br /><br />Adrienna Turner<br />Author of &#34;The Day Begins with Christ&#34;
B0025KVLVA|5.0|bought for ONE track only as I have most all others on this cd...but very glad I did, the remastering was very good:)
B001QKSWOE|4.0|I love all of the Stephanie Plum books and this was no exception.  All of my favorite characters plus Diesel.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I enjoyed this book - was a good read and an interesting blend of stories. the characters were well developed and felt very real.
034580404X|5.0|I really like the trilogy. I really could not put the book down! I think I finished the trilogy within a month. You have to read the whole series in order to realize why Christian Grey is the way he is and how Anastasia Steele is ray of hope for him. It's highly addictive.
B008LVCKH6|5.0|This book is well written and translated; it is whimsical, and yet, informative with humorous and poignant moments throughout. Definitely an enjoyable read. The experiences reminded me of &#34;Forest Gump&#34; and his adventures in the US, but were far more international in scope. Would recommend the book to adult readers who would appreciate the subtle recollections of historical events in the past half-century.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoyed it.  Character development is still strong.  Follett spins great stories in the context of Mid Twentith Contury.  I do object to the cost of the e book.  Publishers continue to be greedy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put this book down if my life depended on it! Loved every minute of reading this book.... def recommend everyone reading this book that likes a mystery and a love story in one!

0545123267|5.0|Pure love. Simple, effortless, easy as breathing. This is the story of Sam and Grace. Maggie Stiefvater has created a story that can only be described as \\"beautiful and sad\\" the way Grace describes Sam. When going into this book don't expect some outrageous plot that most paranormal books have. This is purely and simply a love story with a paranormal element thrown in.<br /><br />Sam is a werewolf. Grace is human, mostly. She had been bitten but never changed. The two finally cross paths again when Sam gets shot and Grace finds him in human form on her back porch. Werewolves change into their wolf form when it starts getting colder, in the spring and summer they can be humans. Only, as years progress they get less and less time to be in human form until finally, they quit changing all together and just remain a wolf the rest of their life. After finally meeting Grace, Sam tries to fight the winter in order to stay human to be with her. Time is limited because this is his last time as a human and if he changes then that's it. No more human Sam, only wolf form.<br /><br />The story of Shiver is melancholy and tragic, but wonderful. Sam and Grace are one of the best book couples I've read about. I could feel their love emitting from the pages and hoped so badly nothing would tear them apart. There are not many books that cause me to feel near tears, but this is one of them. In this book there's nothing forcing Sam and Grace to be apart other than nature itself which, to me, is more tragic than another person or themselves causing chaos because with nature there's little you can do to prevent it.<br /><br />This book is a must read and a must re-read. In all honesty Shiver could probably be read as a standalone if one didn't wish to read the other two books in the series. The ending was that perfect and how endings should be. Stiefvater truly created a poetic masterpiece that will be a favorite of many for years to come.
0060899220|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my daughter.  She loved it so much she purchased it for a friend.  Great Stories within the book!

0061245097|5.0|I would recommend this book.  You just can't wait to see what is going to happen to Cat and Bones next.
0152465030|5.0|Very pleased.  The book was in very good condition.  My neice will read it to her little baby as he grows up as his father will read the French version to the baby.  They were thrilled with the gift.
B000CQO0WQ|4.0|Where was I in the 90's when this came out?  If it wasn't for Pandora, I never would have discovered The Gathering. How to describe this CD: If Meatloaf's band played for Grace Slick and was produced by Trans Siberian Orchestra, you might come close.
B007STXHTM|5.0|I bought this item for my son for a dive trip. It provides a fantastic full spectrum photo with all the crystal clear colors of the rainbow without the fisheye effect. What a great invention!!
B000VIPJKM|4.0|Fun flick we enjoyed back when it first came out and again with our kids! Lots of laughs! Check it out.
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|I bought this so I could watch Amazon Prime movies and TV via my I-Pad on my larger screen TV's.  Unfortunately, this cable does not work with the I-Pad or I-Phone except with certain TV's made after 2011 and 2012.  I wish this information would have been available prior to my purchase.  I now have to return the product because it's useless to me with my 2010 TV's.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I enjoyed this Nicholas Sparks book. I liked the depth of certain characters. Would've like a bit more background on her husband's past to explain his motives better. In general though I am a fan and am looking forward to the film version. Great holiday read while on a beach chair somewhere.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is fun but I'm not able to add my friend. That is the only thing I have an issue with.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|This was a really great compilation of music, DVD, photos and poster. There were four discs in all and it came in a great case! I really liked this and I gave it as a gift. I highly recommend it for any MJ fan!
B00006I53S|5.0|i bought this to add to my &#34;army&#34; of lenses, and with the wider lens, clearer view than the standard kit lens with the cannon cameras, this was a perfect addition to my collection right before i shot a family wedding.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. Good for high school students and even older.  Very touching and relating to real life. No fairy tale
B009JBZH54|5.0|I think the majority of reviews here speak for themselves. This set is awesome. Buy it, you won't regret it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My kids got me hooked on this.  We range for the ages of 46 to 11 and we all enjoy the game.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I give this a four star and was tempted to top it off with a three star. I am a great fan of Vince Flynn. The story line was well-constructed and kept my interest throughout. The characters are well-conceived, liovely and believable ... the plot seems key on the current State Department policies and activity ... and the dialogue crisp. Vince Flynn's writing is snappy and easy to follow. That said ... his over-the-top use of the word 's***' ... jumped out at me after about six instances. and stopped me in my tracks. ie: take no 's***' ... full of 's***' ... something 's***' ... s***, s*** and more s***. Enough more that it took me out of the story too many times. As a city-guy I am used to demonstrative language and I use questionable words too frequently ... but I do try to temper their usage. I bring it up in my review because I believe nothing should come between the writer, the story and the reader. And that's no s***.
0765325950|5.0|I'll say - it was well done for what Sanderson had to work with. There were a few loose ends that didn't get completely tied off, and I'm sure RJ would have finished them and probably done some outlier novels (since the story is simply too immense too finish). My actual review is a 4 star, but I am trying to balance out all the 1 star reviews that this book shouldn't have gotten.<br /><br />All in all, great story, great message.... and I'm happy with where the story went.<br /><br />(Minor Spoilers below)<br />I was extremely happy that BS did something with the bowl of the winds (although it was relatively minor and could have been left out). The characters wasted about 2 whole books searching for the stupid bowl of the winds and it seemed like just filler material... was nice to see it actually used for something.<br /><br />Good job Sanderson, thanks for finishing this. I'm a huge fan of all your work and can't wait for Stormlight Archive #2
B000QCS9NM|4.0|Its good but I am going to half to reread it, I think to fully understand everything. I normally jump right in and love everything Palahniuk writes, this one needs me to mull over it some more......
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I have been a science fiction fan since the late fifties. The problem nowadays is that everything is just the same old thing. That is why when I run across something that is new and well written, I have to comment on it.<br />  The Martian by Andy Weir is just such a book. It is an extreme \\"Survivorman\\" story set on Mars. It is as if the writers of \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" wrote \\"Robinson Crusoe\\". It is heavy on the nerdy science part of science fiction but despite that it is impossible to put down.<br />  Mark Watley, botanist and general handyman on a mission to Mars, is, through no fault of his own, stranded alone on Mars. He must figure out how to survive for more than 500 days until his first possible hope of rescue. He does some things that are incredibly brilliant and some that are just plain stupid.<br />  The majority of the book is his log entries which are funny, sarcastic, fatalistic and, since he is basically talking to himself, have a ring of truth to them.<br />  I remember feeling the same way about \\"Old Man's War\\" when it came out. I hope Andy Weir writes more books as I will be first in line.<br />  Get this book, read this book. You won't be sorry.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|There's just very little about this film that would pass the suspended disbelief believability factor. A warlord capturing and holding New York City? Yes, yes I know, it's Gotham City but really, it's New York City and New York City is an American city and the United States government with the world's most sophisticated and powerful military at its command would have been able to put a stop to something like this in about three seconds. And Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle aka Catwoman kicking everyone's ass in high heels and not once sustaining a scratch or a bruise or even taking a punch herself? Please. Yeah she looks good in skin tight leather but, really? I mean sign her up for UFC cause, she'd rule and I might even become a fan.<br /><br />Comic book fantasy yes but come on, make it just a little bit believable. All the special effects in play here can't overcome the Saturday morning cartoon plot in this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Twists, turns and I was guessing almost to the end. The actual ending? Eh....I'm not sure. The story wrapup seemed to go on a little too long.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|A friend, who is a reading teacher, recommended that I watch this film. Well the joke was on me. I forced myself to watch the whole thing through just because I am a masochist and love giving myself brain pain. Why do films like this become green lit? Better yet, why was the book even published?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|LOVE this book really interesting and loved the letters I want a second book hehehe I suggest this book to all my friends
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am just starting out with this trilogy, but it seems promising.<br />Makes you wonder about people participating in reality shows these days...
B009JBZH54|5.0|Reading the other reviews, everyone wants to diminish the quick release of this trilogy.  The movies are great and the box is a nice material that you can put next to your other 'book' blu ray discs in your collection and be proud of.  It comes with a nice box and a booklet with a ton of photos, etc.  Overall a great initial release of the trilogy.  For this price you can't go wrong.  If you bought the movies separate, not only would you be spending more, you wouldn't get the couple of extra items.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I think this was dazzling and dramatic.<br /><br />It was an another masterpiece done by Suzanne Collins. Every single page was breathtaking
B008TMA1LY|3.0|Bought it for my grandaughter to use.  I still don't understand it.  She plays with it, but I'm not sure she knows what she's doing.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Just saw the movie last night--was concerned about how &#34;seeing&#34; the story would touch my read-ability but am certain now that it will only enhance my appreciation of characters, locales & timeline/sequence. I think the book is beautiful use of language and am grateful to Victor Hugo for his dedication to &#34;the story&#34; to tell all generations.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Awesome...I enjoyed the story...can't wait for part 3. Enjoyed it a little more than 50 shades.. a bit more grown.
B005VPRETE|5.0|As a grandmother with girls, I am thrilled that Lego is coming out with a line for little girls.  The various sets are appealing without being princessy.  Their father, a huge Lego nut, is very happy to see his girls playing with them.  So are the grandparents.  This is the second set I  have purchased for a six year old.
0634022296|4.0|good book good songs i would like to get more song book just like this one and get a good sell on it
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am a 62 year old man who started reading The Hunger Games before I realized that it was written for teens. I found it well written,free of sex,drugs,vulgar language and gratuitous violence. I was hooked. I loved all 3 especially Mockingjay. I recommend them to anyone.
B007PT1PEY|5.0|The Sherlock Holmes collection is fun to read.  I am learning more about Holmes than any movie. It is very interesting and holds my attention and yet you can put it down and pick it up later without losing the extent of the plot.  I would recomment it to anyone.
B003Y5H556|4.0|This movie is a low budget horror/thriller twist on the Red Riding Hood story.  Don't expect oscar worthy acting but it's a good movie and the HD transfer is great!
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game is one to kill a kill time on, perfect for that five spare min time, I would give it a try for new G5 clients
B000VHMF0A|5.0|The album title is very aptly stated.  Bob Marley is an icon for many generations.  This collection captures his finest songs and even some remixes of his most popular songs.  I'm not a huge reggae fan but bought this during an Amazon album sale and am please with this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it, I am so sad the trilogy is over I wish the book went on I'm sad now I loved it very sexual it opened my eyes to life :)
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|You probably are reading this for the blu ray review, not the movies which are absolute classics.  They are transferred beautifully to high defintiion.  The audio is very ear opening as well.  A must upgrade for the true fan.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|This app never ever loaded for me.  What is the point of an app of it doesn't even work.  I've reinstalled and installed this app 3times and it stops loading after I say no to using Facebook!!!  Worst app ever
B009738XXM|3.0|So, there are two songs on this album that are noteworthy but the remaining songs are just &#34;okay&#34;.  Most of the songs sound the same and aren't necessarily &#34;bad&#34; but I wouldn't really rave about them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is an amazing book to read. Just how much love you feel between two people and they haven't even kissed. I would recommend this to everyone I know.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The Hunger Games is a very interesting and provocative drama.  It was great to see this on blu ray and to see how much time and effort the film company spent on the HD quality.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is a great app and works very well. Just as described! It is easy to set up and has worked perfectly for me every time. I got the app while it was free but if you want to access all of your content without taking up any storage space (besides needing wi-fi) The 5 bucks is worth it!
0756686970|5.0|My son enjoyes reading it and asking me questions about the star wars movies and all the characters that he has that are legos

0871404133|4.0|\\"The Social Conquest of Earth\\" touches on so many new and old ideas that it can appear to be a different book to different readers.  Both the breadth of knowledge from other fields and the depth of the coverage (his almost offhand remarks on the Chauvet caves in France made my careful multiple viewings of Werner Herzog's film \\"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\\" seem like kids stuff) are breathtaking.<br /><br />In my view, the new ideas that form the core of the book are:<br /><br />1. While we tend to view only a few ant/termite/bee societies as eusocial, it's both accurate and profitable to view humans that way too. Humans too form a \\"superorganism\\" with multiple generations living together, specialization, food sharing, and young cared for in part by the entire band; so much so that the idea of an individual human living all by themselves wasn't realistic.<br /><br />2. Such \\"superorganisms\\" are subject to _multi-level_ natural selection, at both the individual level and the group level, all at the same time.<br /><br />3. Selection pressure at different levels sometimes conflict: what's best for the group (for example giving one's life as a soldier) is sometimes different from what's best for the individual (for example becoming the patriarch of a large family). This conflict goes on and on forever; there's never a \\"final\\" answer. Every human must constantly re-balance what's best for themselves and what's best for their band.<br /><br />There's also focus on another idea I don't think is so new (but maybe I'm just misinformed:-):<br /><br />4. Genetic capabilities help channel the development of culture (culture isn't infinitely variable). At the same time -going the other way- cultural development applies a bit of genetic selection pressure.<br /><br />Given the timing, one might expect this book to contain the detailed reasoning behind Wilson's abjuration of \\"kin selection\\" in the Nowak/Tarnita/Wilson paper. It doesn't; approaching the book this way will be disappointing. Cogent reasoning for preferring group selection to kin selection is presented, but only very briefly on the way to something else. And -as one might expect from an \\"equation-free\\" book like this- the mathematics is completely omitted. One reason I remember is that \\"group selection\\" fits the data of what actually goes on in the world better than \\"kin selection\\". The other reason I remember is that \\"kin selection\\" hasn't been very scientifically productive during its four-decade reign; its contributions to new insights and experimental design, and its ability to predict how societies will actually behave, have been quite a bit less than expected.<br /><br />In this book, Wilson abandons the usual blather about \\"different non-overlapping spheres\\", and says frankly that the religious worldview and the scientific worldview are in conflict. This seems to me a big change. I distinctly remember several years ago Wilson on a talk radio show, a caller asking him about \\"the commandment to be fruitful and multiply\\" and Wilson simply answering  that \\"nobody takes that seriously any more\\". I was amazed at his brazenly refusing to even acknowledge the possibility of a conflict between science and religion. He doesn't follow that approach here.<br /><br />It seemed to me that a lot of the discussion in later chapters of the book was suggestions for how various academic fields could divvy up the turf rationally, and directions for future research. Although I 'm not sure because it's been an awful long time since I read his \\"Sociobiology\\", parts of this book felt similar to what I'd found there. It seems to me that -regardless of whether these suggestions are \\"right\\"- they're of no interest to the lay reader.<br /><br />Compared to the very high standards Wilson's books have led us to expect of him, he seems to be \\"running out of gas\\" a little bit. Don't get me wrong though - a middling book at this very high standard is still better than most normal books.<br /><br />Subjects from some of his other books are mentioned or even re-addressed, particularly toward the end. Wilson ends with a plea for a scientifically valid \\"rational\\" treatment of humanity's future (something that's a frequent theme of Wilson's, but seldom stated so clearly). Among other things, both climate change and overpopulation need to be addressed (and not with some glib crazy response about other planets either). This is inspiring  ...even if on reflection it seems less than realistic.rom some of his other books are mentioned or even re-addressed, particularly toward the end.

1401322786|3.0|I received this book for Christmas since mom knows I'm a Mitch Albom fan.  It's a pretty quick read, and at first I wondered where he was going with the story, but it does tie up nicely at the end.  The novel is an innovative approach to an old idea, and I enjoyed it.  However, \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\" was much more riveting to me and really got the same point across, only better:  time is fleeting, so make the most of it.  Good gift for any Albom fan (but if they haven't read TWM, get that instead).
B000MD9UJC|4.0|There are other LEDs which are brighter or offer longer battery life, but there are still some not-so-obvious advantages to this little upgrade kit.  My AA Maglite is used primarily for camping/backpacking and astronomy, and for both purposes, this LED kit excels!<br /><br />Given that the older halogen bulb Maglites were so lightweight, durable, and could double as a small lantern (by removing the lens/reflector housing), they have been a favorite for camping.  Before upgrading my older halogen flashlights, I tried one of the newer Maglite-branded LED models.  I was disappointed to find that the LED was nearly flat, making its use as a lantern much less practical (the light was too directional).  However, the LED on this Nite-Ize upgrade protrudes nearly as much as the old bulb, which makes it quite effective.  Combine this with the substantial increase in battery life over the old bulbs and it's a winner.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure about using the on/off switch.  I was afraid that while backpacking, the light could accidentally \\"bump\\" on and run down the battery.  If the top of the flashlight is screwed down (the traditional Maglite on/off mechanism), the on/off switch is effectively disabled.<br /><br />Finally, as an astronomer (using a red filter, of course!!), I appreciate that the bulb is not as bright as most (including the Maglite-branded) LED flashlights.  Even with a red filter, many newer flashlights are simply TOO bright.  The Night-Ize bulb is far more tolerable while offering the improved battery life and durability over standard bulbs.<br /><br />I have four old AA Maglites, and have upgraded all of them with this product.  I am quite happy with it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a great movie on all accounts, 3D and 2D!<br />When I first got my 3D Panasonic TV (2011 55GT31) a version (3D promotional disc only) of this movie came with the TV.  I played the 2D version in my old theater setup (2008 LG Plasma and Sony Bluray player) next to the new 3D setup (55GT31 and Pana Bluray player).  3D brings a whole new appearance to the movie- The flight scenes are realistic, the crowds of people look like a crowd of people.  Incredible movie to tryout your new 3Dtv (same with Despicable me, Lorax, IMAX under the sea movie, and many other newer movies.) Keep in mind that the Avatar promo disc (sold with TV's) was selling for $60 to $120 each on ebay and craigslist. So apparently someone was out loving and buying 3D movies then, and many more are now.<br />If you have had a bad experience with 3D at home, chances are that the TV was not setup for an optimal 3D experience, or it was a low end model with low end glasses (flicker and ghosting); And that also includes the setups at Best Buy- They crank up the TV with Vivid modes and has too much ambient lighting, that ruins the experience in my opinion.  You have to watch 3D movies more than once to gain an appreciation for 3D. I compare it to the difference of SD DVD's and HD Blurays.  Try a different manufacturers tv and glasses.  True, TV broadcast versions on Directv is not the greatest yet, but is still fun to see what is filmed in 3D.  I do not plan to watch Dora on TV, in 3D anytime soon.  We do watch at least one 3d movie per week (many good ones release all the time) in our house hold.<br /><br />The cost for 3D has dropped dramatically to make it work for all of us. You just have to buy smart to get it, as with anything in life.  I don't buy the  $36 version from Target.  Typically, I will buy my 3D discs from Amazon, under their preorder deal, and sometimes with Best Buy, which works great to get it at a great low price on the day of release.  I can usually get the 3D disc from $20 to $30 from this deal (usually $24). It comes with many multiple versions of the movie (3d, 2D-bluray, digital, UV, maybe DVD too).  Keep in mind that the \\"just released\\" 2D version is typically $23 - $30. If you wait till after the Preoder special, then it does go up to $33 or so, for the good movies.  GREAT DEAL from Amazon.<br /><br />Great 3D movie to go with your new 3DTV movie collection.  GET IT !!!

B005LAIISU|5.0|We absolutely love this movie!  We saw it in the theater (twice for me and my youngest son) and he was eager for it to come out on DVD.  We pre-ordered through Amazon for his Christmas present.  We love the BluRay combo pack as we get the Blu Ray and the DVD version as well as the digital copy.  This way we can play it on our Sony PS3 or if we travel he can use his portable DVD player and enjoy it.<br /><br />The movie is full of humor as well as adventure.  All ages will find this movie funny and enjoyable.  As with the previous Ice Age movies it portrays the importance of strong bonds with family and friends.

B007Q0OUNA|5.0|This is a very unique set with the circular stone tower.  My 11 year old was able to construct it without any problems independently.  It also has been a sturdy set that he has been able to move from room to room without difficulty. We're very pleased with the set and would recommend it.

B001CDZZI6|3.0|I had purchased the hardback book initially and I only got the kindle book so I could get the code to take the strengths assessment online.  I read through the entire book and then took the assessment.  The premise of the book is that we will be more successful and happy in our work if we are utilizing our strengths rather then trying to overcome our weaknesses.  The online assessment then provides you with your top five areas of strength, describes those strengths and  how to utilize them.  I found the report to basically be a reiteration of the book when it was describing the strengths.  I don't feel it is really necessary to read the book to get value of the assessment.  We have had our entire team at work take the assessment and I recommended to them they purchase the ebook which was cheaper at the time.  The book is really only useful to read about the strengths of my teammates so that I can better understand them.

B005OCFHHK|5.0|A PLEASANT SURPRISE! I ordered the set thru a friend from Michigan (I'm from the Philippines). When the packaged arrived, he immediately sent me a private message saying that the discs are region free. But the US & Philippines, belonging to Region A, it's a not really a big deal for me, but still a good surprise, nevertheless. But when I finally got the package, The big surprise was that it's the 11-disc collection that Amazon sent. Must be a new packaging with 3 additional discs of special features in BR, and I only payed for the original packaging as sold by Amazon. Now, it's even worth more than the price it was sold. Thanks Amazon!
B007EW9ISM|1.0|I gave this product a 1 because I've been looking for a stylus that is conducive to writing on a tablet. The videos and some of the reviews supported that this would be ideal for my needs. It does have a FIRMER tip, but it is still a little squishy like other stylus pens. This leads to breaks in what I am writing. It is supposed to have no lag on the tablet but it does. In addition, using this like a stylus to tap on icons is useless because of the firmer tip. I didn't like it.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Another great book by Grisham!  The story intrigues the reader from the beginning and keeps you guessing until the end.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I bought this case because I wanted something I could take totally off the kindle while I read. This sleeve is padded well, has two good zippers, and a nice leather corner for looks, which also feels nice when carrying it.<br />After a year, this case is still in great condition, showing almost no signs of wear.<br />The corner was not too tight for my kindle touch, as some people said.  It fit just right.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I liked the book, but it was hard to get started. The book is written in short sections and jumps around ( dates, locations, people). Once you get the characters down and the timelines, it's a good read.

B009E9R2OK|5.0|PLEASE NOTE that this is a review of \\"Celebration Day (Blu-ray Audio),\\" which features only audio and screen menus. There are many packagings  of this title available -- almost to the point of absurdity, but hey, it's Led Zeppelin, right? At any rate, the version/disc I'm reviewing here is designed to be played only in Blu-ray players.<br /><br />Honestly, I wanted to hear the music before I committed to buying some version of the video that was shot at the O2 Arena that great night when the mighty Zep took finally took the stage again -- December 10, 2007. And now, after hearing the music, I'm not even sure I NEED any of the video. That's one point I want to emphasize here: No matter what version you buy, don't just get sucked into the visuals. Led Zeppelin was and is a band to be heard.<br /><br />Let's do the nerdy sound quality thing first. Blu-ray Audio, like DVD Audio and SACD, is capable of delivering multichannel sound, so if you have a system with multiple speakers fed by separate channels, you can hear performances in, say, 5.1 channels. The \\"5\\" are these speakers: left front, center, left right, surround right, sourround left. The \\"1\\" in 5.1 is your subwoofer. Basically, 5.1 or more channels take you beyond the old 2-channel stereo mix, putting you in the middle of the performance. Sometimes this works well, and sometimes not; it depends on many things including the quality of the source material and the skill of the engineers and mixers who re-mix the stuff for 5.1. For two good examples, pick up Pink Floyd's SACD version of \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and if you can find it because it's out of print, Roxy Music's SACD of \\"Avalon.\\"<br /><br />So does \\"Celebration Day\\" work in 5.1 sound? Yes, phenomenally well, and the reason is that everyone involved in this effort apparently refused to get fancy and cute with it. You won't hear any instruments mixed prominently in the back channels here, although I've certainly heard that used to good effect on some mixes. You won't catch the engineer panning the sound this way and that. No, the reason for the 5.1 here is to re-create the feeling of being in that arena that night. So the band is basically up front, and the back channels are capturing the booming reverb of the O2. You know from the opening song that this is a concert recording. But the effect is kept in check, too; it's got JUST the right amount of thundering ambiance to enhance to performance of the group.<br /><br />There were a couple occasions during quiet songs, and between songs, where I could hear people murmuring or chattering a bit, as if they were standing a few feet to my left or right or behind. Trust me: It's kept to a minimum and it's not intrusive at all. Besides, if that kind of thing bothers you, why would you go to a rock concert anyway?<br /><br />Now to Led Zeppelin's performance: Of course it's impossible to make a perfect comparison to previous Zep shows, mostly because Zeppelin drummer John Bonham died in 1980. Here the drum chair is filled by none other than his son, Jason Bonham, who already has had quite a long career in his own right; his exploits include leading his own namesake band (\\"Bonham\\") in the 1980s and 1990s and starring as drummer \\"A.C.\\"  in the 2001 movie \\"Rock Star.\\"<br /><br />I've always been a fan of his playing but confess that Jason at times has impressed me as being even more of a basher than this father. John Bonham's drumming was hugely powerful, but he also was capable of surprising restraint; he knew when to let up a little and let a song breathe. Well, perhaps Jason just needed seasoning. His playing on \\"Celebration Day\\" is nothing less than thrilling from start to finish. He especially seems to be enjoying the slower, burning blues numbers such as \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" and \\"In My Time of Dying.\\" And the way he interacts with guitarist Jimmy Page on \\"Dazed and Confused\\" does remind one of the near-telepathy Page and the elder Bonham used to conjure up on that song.<br /><br />Speaking of Page, before this recording, he hadn't sounded this good and this together in years, having floundered around with various musical projects that didn't seem to add up to much. Perhaps of all the members of the band, he was most attached to it, and left most lost when John Bonham died. Who knows? But on this night, the magic is back under his fingertips. I even ACTIVELY LISTENED to \\"Stairway to Heaven,\\" which never was my favorite Zeppelin song, and which was played to death by 1970s FM radio programmers. His intro here is especially gentle; you can HEAR him savoring these notes, calling up their power even after having played this so many times in his life.<br /><br />\\"There's a spirit I get when I look to the west,\\" Plant sings as Page starts digging deeper into \\"Stairway,\\" and it's a line directed not at six-guns and Stetsons but to Arthurian legend, or at least to \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\" Plant, too, sounds thoroughly and completely in the moment, glad and happy to be revisiting a proud past.<br /><br />But the man who pushes \\"Celebration Day\\" from four-star rating to full five is bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones. His showcase back in the days was always \\"No Quarter,\\" an eerie song whose misty, moonless-night atmosphere was due largely to Jones' haunting electric piano intro. That's an instrument that fell out of favor even in rock circles a long time ago, partly because it eventually became possible to reproduce the sound of an acoustic concert grand. Jones, though, wisely sticks to the relic here, and hearing it again is stepping into an aural time machine. Welcome back to 1973, ladies and gentlemen! Jones also shines on \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" and \\"Kashmir.\\"<br /><br />Couple of final thoughts: First, you couldn't ask for a better set list; every single Zeppelin studio album is represented by at least one song here, with the exception of \\"In Through the Out Door\\" and the compilation/leftovers album \\"Coda,\\" issued after John Bonham died. In fact, just listing the songs, they ring out, like anthems of time:<br /><br />\\"Ramble On\\" ... \\"Black Dog\\" ... \\"Dazed and Confused\\" ... \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" ... \\"Rock and Roll.\\"<br /><br />This really is a fine, joyous album, truly living up to its title. Audiophiles will appreciate the incredible quality of the Blu-ray mix. And for those who want to hear how Zeppelin sounded live back in the 1960s-1980, I highly recommend \\"How the West Was Won.\\" There's also the DVD that's just titled \\"Led Zeppelin.\\" And while some defend it, I've always advised avoiding the live album \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" which presents one of their weaker, more self-indulgent performances.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin remains not only a cultural force, which is what people wrongly tend to focus on, but also one of the best bands to come out of the 1960s and find its full expression and potential in the 1970s. In short, this music stands up, decade after decade.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|I am just crazy about this show! Such smart intelligent wit. These actors are with out a doubt simply excellent!
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Great deal. It was exactly what I was looking for in this product. Recieved super fast with no problems noted. Thanks again!!
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Let me start out by saying I love the percy jacson and the olympians books. I really do and thats why its so painful for me to only give this book 3 stars because the first five books were so fun so new had such great characters. I mean those were the first books I read as a kid but sadly at the end of the day these books just dont hold up<br /><br />Like everyone when I first heard about the Lost Hero (the first book i n this spinnoff series) I rolled my eyes it seemed like such a copy of the original, but it suprised me when it actually turned out to be a well put together book. okay sure Jason was kind of a boy scout but the other characters mainly Leo, Piper, and Coach Hedge were very likeable, and it kept the fun light heartedness that made the first five so enjoyable. The only thing that hd it back was like I said Jason he is a boring flat character but still it was a good book overall.<br /><br />When I heard about Son of Neptune (book 2) this time I naturally I got pretty excited. I mean if the thing that weighed down The Lost Hero was the main character it made sense that with the return of Percy Jackson this book would be utter perfection. So what did I think of the book when it came out? &#34;eh&#34;. It was okay. Its actually kinda interesting how in the Lost Hero its the main character thats not so good and the supporting characters that were great. But in Son of Neptune its just the opossite. The two main supporting characters Hazel and Frank are unberably stupid I mean it goes beyond annoying there powers, backstorys, and romance is just plane stupid. But to the books credit the story is quite clever, and most importantly Percy Jackson is just awesome.<br /><br />Still the great character weve come to love Im glad Rick Riordan decided to keep Percys character pretty similar to the original series, he's charming and cocky but knows when to shut up and focus, he's not very smart but always knows when to do the right thing. Away from water he's not verystrong but never backs down from a fight and will do whatever it takes to help his friends. No Percy hasnt changed much from the original books and thats just fine.<br /><br />But we arent here to glorify Percy. actually we kinda are. but we are mostly here to review.<br /><br />So when Mark of Athena hit stores it was kind of a mosh pit of good and bad characters, and alot of of the time thats works against it. There were were several times I found myself thinking &#34;Jason shut up so percy can talk&#34; or &#34;please stop talking about frank and go back to Leo&#34;. And this is really to bad because the stuff this book does well iit does really well. one of the situations were annabeth is forced to complete a portion of the quest alone this is great because it forces a character that usually hides behind percy to take initiative and fight her own battles revieling she can be strong and independent but also vulnerable however great parts like this are constantly ruined by the continues stupidity of other parts. So the premise of the story is basicly they need to go from CA to Greece and its mainly about the challenges they face along the way 2 or 3 of these challenges are good but  the rest of them just seem rushed and uninterestd. if onnly one or 2 of the challeges were like that i wouldnt have much of a problem. but literaly amost every challenge is just weird. Also i do like rick riordans choice to go tl ancienct greece and rome I mean when the book starts talking about the origin of greek mythology it is nice to actually see the origins of greek mythology.<br /><br />Overall do I hate the book? no. In fact there are a few moments when I feel like a ten year old reading the original Lightning Thief. But these moments are just too few and far between and there are so many akward moments and characters that keep sucking you out of it.<br /><br />So in the end the best score I can give it is a three. If you liked the first 2 or the original series go ahead and give this a read youll probably still find it entertaining. But if you havent read any of the previous books this probably isnt the book for you. If you think the idea is cool or you're trying to get into the series. I recomend Percy Jackson and the Olymians: book 1 The Lightning Thief

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is pretty fun. The one improvement would be a tutorial on the mini games explaining how to play them on start up, sometimes it takes several tries too even figure out game play. Other than that it's a game that the kids and I can both enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's really fun. there's a lot of games to chose from. a wide range of kinds of games to fit anyones taste.

B001ANSS5K|5.0|After a very tough semester that allowed no time for recreational reading, Paper Towns kicked off my Holiday vacation wonderfully. I adored Quentin's character and those of all of his friends; how refreshing to read about good kids. Margo, the character this book is centered upon, is intriguing. She's not 100% likeable, but she isn't supposed to be. She's full of surprises in many ways and I found it completely plausible that Q would go through so much trouble for her and I just loved the energy and assistance his friends provided. They also provided great comic relief. I could easily picture them outside the band room and could easily hear their witty, yet immature, discussions and they definitely had me laughing.<br /><br />Green provides enough history and information so that you're not left questioning anyone's actions; nothing is out of character. Paper Towns is wonderfully written altogether. Green's descriptions, pacing, character development, and narration are all spot on. This is a lovely book about a lovely story that happens to lovely kids. It is also thought-provoking and intelligent. I highly recommend this book and I am glad to have discovered John Green and I look forward to reading more of him.

B004742Y3G|5.0|This is not the first time I have watched this movie, but it is an old time favorite of mine.  My husband and I could not believe the excellent quality and how much of a difference HD made versus regular DVD.
B005EM8O8O|3.0|I have read everything Robert Harris has written. His Cicero works are astonishing. This book is far afield from that. The story is so intense that I had to keep putting the book down and then I'd say to myself, I don't care about any of these characters why do I care what happens? And I'd pick it up again. He has drawn them all as greedy and despicable and totally without moral compass. I like the main character's wife but the rest who cares. I think the author achieved what he wanted so I suppose that makes it a good book. And I read the whole thing and the events and outcome feel very real.  But it was just uncomfortable for me so I can't quite say it's a good book.
B005CGI3ZG|3.0|I am enjoying the show. Never watched it when it was on tv. Some of the DVDs have bad voice over but all in all a good show

Or a stroke. Or a blood clot.<br />Or maybe you get into a car accident.<br /><br />Looking back, do you think you lived your life to the fullest extent? Enjoyed every minute?<br />We're often so busy complaining about all our daily discomforts. Struggling through stressful working days. Living day-to-day: sleep, work, eat, work, sleep, work etc. etc. - you get the idea.<br />And then, in the blink of an eye, everything's over.<br /><br />They say your whole life flashes before your eyes just before you die.<br /><br />Well this is exactly what happened to Mia, our main character.<br />She has a lovely family, an awesome best friend and an intensive, loving relationship with Adam, a musician just like her. She recently applied for a music school in New York and chances are good they are going to accept her. Adam though, has other plans with his band. It seems like they'll have to part ways, which neither of them really wants. While desperately trying to find a solution, Mia and her family go on a trip... and end up in a horrible car accident. Somehow stuck between death and life, Mia has to decide if she wants to stay in this world or not.<br /><br />This story is so sad. So sad.<br />I don't think I have ever cried as much over a book. I know I am prone to tears but seriously, I didn't expect that much weeping. I needed several breaks because it was hard to face that much sadness.<br /><br />The reader is confronted with the car accident on the very first pages and afterwards accompanies Mia on a journey through her past.

I can't even.<br /><br />At first, I was wondering, why would you name your post-apocalyptic-sci-fi-dystopian novel \\"Wool\\".<br />Figured that one out pretty soon and now I think it's an awesome title for the whole series.<br /><br />The first book of the five, is pretty short but all the more intense!<br />It left me disbelieving, shocked, surprised and certainly wanting to read more, getting behind the secrets going on there!<br />That continued with the next books, though I must say, the opening stayed unbeaten.<br /><br />In the future people cannot survive on the outside anymore as the air is toxic and they would suffer a horrible death.<br />Therefore they are living in a `silo'. A huge complex deep in the earth, with around 140 floors, all connected with a stairwell that goes all the way from the top to the deep down.<br />There are apartments, farms, nurseries, a mechanical section, IT section. Also there are areas to enjoy yourself, like gardens or a room on the very top where you can have a view on the deserted outside through cameras.<br />Only the people who live in the upper parts of the silo usually get to see the outside, people from deep down may as well just live their entire life down there.<br />However, people basically have everything they need to lead a rather decent but very controlled life.<br />Relationships have to be approved and children are only allowed if you win the lottery which gives you one year of \\"trying to make a baby\\". Lucky ones do get twins.<br />The whole silo is ruled by the mayor, supported by the sheriff who is the law and deals with problems like one inhabitant ate the other inhabitant's rat or something.<br />Everyone dutifully obeys the rules to live in that silo and does their work, minding their own business. They can have all kind of jobs, like nurse or doctor, cook, priest or porter who transports all kind of stuff throughout the entire silo. It is very complex, but somehow it works, as people fear they could be put out for `cleaning' if they don't follow the rules.<br />`Cleaning' is what happens if you question the entire system and regime. A `safety' suit will be designed for you, you'll be equipped with cleaning supplies and then you're sent out of the silo to clean the cameras that are streaming the outside view to the area at the very top of the silo. After the cleaning is done, you're not allowed to come back inside, instead you may walk away, as far as you can get until the toxic air gets through your suit and kills you. Nobody ever survived the cleaning, it's basically death penalty to be sent for cleaning.<br />Cleaning is important to keep things running within the silo and to remind people to always follow the rules and not listen to the sick, disturbed individuals that well deserved the cleaning.<br /><br />Life goes on like this for centuries. People in the silo are born, they die, they love, they hate. They don't question the silo, as it is all they know and there is not much information left about how the world used to be ages ago, when the air wasn't toxic yet. It's all lost - or rather has been made lost.<br /><br />And omg, speaking of inhabitants dying. Am I the only one, who found it slightly disgusting, that they bury dead people ON THE FARMS TO DECOMPOSE AND SERVE AS FERTILIZER?<br />I mean, I understand the whole `circle of life' idea and new life evolving out of life that passed away. But seriously, the thought of dead people rotting away in soil and feeding the roots of the plants that later on will be eaten by inhabitants - eww. Left me slightly disgusted.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />The whole concept of this book got me. I could almost feel the thick walls of the silo, felt trapped in there and was constantly wondering if it really is that toxic on the outside, or if it is just something the people who rule the silo make up to keep people under control. I find the idea to live my entire life in a freaking silo totally frightening and nightmarish. But yea, those people don't know it any different...<br /><br />With time, a few individuals in there find more and more hints that something is hidden from them. They figure out they are being lied to and life doesn't necessarily mean to live in the silo for the rest of their lives and being controlled like that. Looks like there actually is a chance that everything outside isn't as bad as they're told and furthermore, maybe they're not alone - there might be even more people on the outside! The uprising begins...<br /><br />Each and every character convinced me. They were drawn out so well, their feelings and fears expressed in emotional depth. It was hurtful to accompany some of them on their last steps to the outside and a certain death. I felt with them and feared what could happen to them, hoping they would somehow make it out of this mess.<br />When some of them died it always left me sad and angry - another life that had to end because of the weird things going on in that s*** silo!<br /><br />It was just not possible to put away that book, I was totally caught up in it and the character's stories. It's just amazing how suspenseful it is, never was I bored and not only once I held my breath as to the thrilling situations, twist and turns.<br /><br />The writing sometimes was a bit too techy when it came to all the mechanical stuff going on and whatever they were constructing, but overall it was an easy and enjoyable read.<br /><br />The end was maybe a bit too honeyed for me. Like, after all the horrible stuff that happened it was just the typical Disney-ish ending, the princess gets her prince and everything is all rainbows and candy. I would have maybe wished for another final shocker. Also, at some point I already predicted the end and who would be majorly involved in it - and it actually happened. So, yea.<br />NONETHELESS it was an awesome book which I would strongly recommend to everyone loving post-apocalyptic, dystopian novels. You won't regret reading it.<br /><br />I didn't want the book to end really and I still have a lot of questions about the back-story of those silos, but as I could read in the epilog there may be sequels *yay*any different...

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This was written from a very different perspective.  It is well written and keeps the reader interested.  I would recommend it to dog lovers.
030771652X|5.0|Sister was an intense, emotional, touching, moving and yet suspenseful thriller that took my breath away. In terms of intensity it reminded me a lot of \\"If I Stay\\", which basically left me as an emotional train wreck.<br /><br />In the beginning it was a bit difficult to get into the story as Beatrice jumps between times very often. In one moment she's sitting in a police officer's room, giving evidence about what happened to her younger sister Tess. In the next paragraph she's jumping back in time when she was trying to find out about the crime that has been committed to Tess. The next second she is further back in the past talking about family life.<br /><br />After a few pages it becomes clearer though and it's easy to follow her thoughts.<br /><br />The reader is basically reading a letter, written by Beatrice (\\"Bee\\") to her dead sister Tess.<br />She starts with Tess' sudden disappearance. Beatrice cannot believe that Tess simply could have run away, without saying a word. Their relationship had always been very strong, two sisters who loved each other, who understood each other without even having to exchange a word and who went through so much together.<br />After a few horrible days of hoping and fearing, Tess is found dead in Hyde Park.<br />It looks like she has committed suicide, but Beatrice immediately knows this cannot be true and Tess must have been murdered. Tess would have never killed herself as she cherished life far too much to simply throw it away like that. One reason for that is the tragic death of their little brother Leo who died of mucoviscidosis at very young age. While Beatrice is still shattered about her sister's death and goes through the most horrible time of grief and sorrow, she starts investigating - almost obsessively. The police do not believe anything she uncovers, as for them it is more convenient to stick to the suicide story. That doesn't stop Beatrice though and soon she finds out what really happened to her beloved Tess.<br /><br />It is such a tragic story that moved me in a way I totally didn't expect.<br />The first few pages already broke all dams and the tears were flooding.<br /><br />I, too, have a sister who I love just as much as Beatrice loves her sister Tess and vice versa. We don't need to talk to each other to understand how we're feeling or what we're going through. We don't even have to see each other.<br />There simply is this unexplainable bond that nobody on the `outside' can understand.<br />I cannot even fathom what I would do if I lost her. You could probably lock me up in a padded cell and keep me there.<br />Like forever.<br />Even thinking about it already makes my head spin and experiencing the deep mourning Beatrice had to go through was simply heartbreaking.<br />What a wonderful coincidence: If you translate my sister's name it means \\"Bee\\", too.<br /><br />It was the perfect mix between tense and affecting, so it was impossible for me to put that book away.<br /><br />The end surprised and shocked me. It was one of those moments when you think you should've noticed certain things all the way through the book, but somehow you didn't.<br /><br />The writing was touching, it was easy to empathize and feel with the characters.<br />I do think my explanations above already made it very clear that I could identify with them very well.<br />Although, I assume that people who don't know/share that same bond with a sibling as my sister and I (or Bee and Tess) cannot get into the story just as well.<br /><br />Also, people who expect a typical blood and thunder thriller will probably be a bit disappointed, as this book concentrates more on the emotional side of things.<br /><br />Rosamund is an author that I didn't know before but after this book I'll certainly have an eye on her :)/><br />It is such a tragic story that moved me in a way I totally didn't expect.<br />The first few pages already broke all dams and the tears were flooding.<br /><br />I, too, have a sister who I love just as much as Beatrice loves her sister Tess and vice versa.

B004QX07G4|1.0|I bought this book while it was on sale, thinking it was a great deal since I love watching Ellen's show. Boy was I wrong. The book is barely humorous and I found myself completely bored while reading it. It seemed like Ellen was trying way to hard to be funny and needless to say, she failed. Save your money, this book isn't worth your time.
0345803485|1.0|To be honest, I never even intended to read ,Fifty Shades of Grey`. There are certain things in life you just don't have to bear. Especially with books, there are so many reviewers out there, who bravely dared to read this book and shared their reading experience with us. By reading those reviews you can already get a good impression of a book without even reading it. After all that's what reviews are made for in the first place.<br />My review probably will not add world shaking news to what has already been mentioned in uncountable reviews, but I am going to write it anyway.<br /><br />It felt like `Fifty Shades of Grey' bit everybody in my personal environment like an annoying tick. Everyone - may it be co-workers or friends - were telling me how awesome James' books are and asking if I had already read them and if not, omg, WHY NOT?<br />Of course, I voiced my opinion about these books which resulted in confused looks, endless fruitless discussions and the deep need (on their side) to convince me of this marvelous, romantic love story. When this didn't work, they moved on to the ultimate knockout argument: \\"But you haven't even read it!\\"<br />Oh, I understand. Seems like you can only have a valid opinion about this hyped trash if you read it yourself! Well okay then, I thought.<br /><br />Well, what shall I say?<br />I was right.<br /><br />`Fifty Shades of Grey' must be the biggest pile of @#$%% printed on paper I ever read. Several days of my life - gone! For this! My eyes hurt from all the rolling and it is only due to the support of my dear friends on Goodreads that I didn't go completely insane.<br /><br />Where do I begin?<br /><br />This extreme hype surrounding `Fifty Shades of Grey' is certainly not a result of its literary brilliance. It is not a book that convinces through a unique writing style, or deep characters, or a well-elaborated story - no. It's about sex. Kinky Sex. That's what they say at least. q.e.d.<br /><br />1. Anastasia Steele<br /><br />That name. Savor it. *lol*.<br />She's 21, virgin, likes to read British novels, doesn't know anything about the internet, emails etc. and drives a VW beetle. That is probably supposed to make her somewhat likeable to the reader, you know, to identify with her and stuff. However, the rest of her \\"personality\\" more feels like a dull, chewed up and spat out candy. She's more than naïve and blushes at every opportunity like a rabid firefly. Neither does she have any self-esteem nor any self-confidence. When it comes to men, she doesn't have any experience either - she has never kissed anyone, never held hands.<br />In short: She doesn't have the vaguest idea what she has let herself in for.<br /><br />2. Christian Grey<br /><br />SEX GOD.<br />Most attractive man ever!<br />He's so handsome, infinitely rich, listens to opera, has an enormous cock, oh, and he saves the world. The Third World in particular. Just like that. All of this by just the age 27. Woah!<br />Every woman that catches sight of him blushes because he's oh so good-looking - he simply does have that weird effect on women. I don't even know!<br />He's not the romantic type of guy though; he's more the unapproachable, tough, possessive dude.<br /><br />To be very clear: Christian Grey is a self-important, arrogant, bossy, perverted, dangerous stalker and control freak.<br />Christian Grey is a victim of his terrible youth?<br />Poor guy.<br />Aren't they all just victims?<br /><br />That guy is dangerous and every woman who gets close to a guy like this should run as fast as she can.<br /><br />3. The kinky sex! OMG!<br /><br />Erm, so where exactly were the kinky sex practices?<br /><br />Overall this book is about Christian discovering the world of vanilla sex. Only two times in the entire book they do something that could be considered BDSM. But even there, it wasn't really shocking - honestly, the sex in this book overall was pretty normal and really not that exciting. Nothing about it was even close to arousing, as everything was always described in the same words over and over again which resulted in the sex seeming like a mechanical farce.<br /><br />Ana's defloration was so horrible; I'm seriously surprised she didn't come out of this totally traumatized. It seemed like she was pretty much penetrated by a hammer-drill instead of a penis. Total lack of empathy and respect on Christian's side here. Not only he screams at her when she admits that she's still a virgin (how dare she!), next he tells her they must solve this unbearable \\"situation\\" and just get rid of that damn hymen so they can enter the promising world of D/s eventually.<br /><br />He harasses her all the freaking time with his weird contract and doesn't leave her the necessary time to think about it. She tries hard to not make the decision to sign it too hasty, but every time she really starts thinking about it, Christian seduces her. Because he can. He knows that she can't resist him and that makes it easy for him to get his way. That pretty much shows what kind of person he is.<br />He even dares to manipulate Ana into thinking that her signing the contract isn't really necessary in the end because, well, they already are in a D/s relationship, aren't they? This man doesn't have any qualms and steals the last remains of her autonomy.<br /><br />Thing is:<br />A D/s relationship like that needs two individuals of equal rank, who respect each other and know their boundaries well. This certainly is not the case, especially not with Anastasia. She's forced into all of this, because he is only giving her two options: Sink or swim. Do as he commands, or leave. She's already too much of a slave to him to leave though. Which brings up the key point:<br /><br />Ana doesn't love Christian, she's sexually dependent.<br /><br />4. Sexual Dependency<br /><br />What is sexual dependency?<br /><br />The psychological dependence on someone. An exaggerated human dependency to the point of self-abandonment, particularly sexual bondage to the sexual partner. The dependent partner unconditionally follows the sexual partners will, also, if that should significantly result in their own detriment. In general, the bondage is perceived as an unequal dependency by outsiders.<br />[...]<br /><br />Please, what is it that would make Christian Grey lovable?<br /><br />- He goes berserk when she doesn't answer his mails/texts right away = sick.<br />- He goes berserk every time Ana talks to other men, may it be friends or even her brother = even sicker.<br />- He defies her decisions and motivations, instead always want to get it his way, regardless of the consequences = sick.<br />- To him, she's a sex object that he wants to possess = sick.<br /><br />Yes, there are couples who enjoy a D/s relationship and as long as it is okay for both of them and nobody is harmed through it, it's totally all right.<br /><br />But this is not the case in `Fifty Shades of Grey'.<br /><br />His compulsive, controlling behavior takes place pretty much outside of his little playroom in the real world. Ana is very limited when it comes to her personal freedom; she almost can't be herself anymore. She's not able to make decisions or even think about them, because Christian is always sexing her up. She's not a real partner but more of an object that always shall be available to him, keeping her mouth shut and follow his commands without objections.<br /><br />This is dangerous and has nothing to do with BDSM or love, even.<br /><br />You can easily see that Ana is forced into this situation, which is causing more harm to her than good, when she does/says stuff like the following:<br /><br />- She is always feeling unwell and queasy when she thinks about Christian's sexual preferences. She's basically disgusted by them.<br />- She is scared of him and his regularly appearing choleric tantrums.<br />- She even thinks about fleeing to hide from him at a secret place where he cannot find her.<br />- She's giving him bad names in her thoughts, names, which Amazon won't let me quote here as per their \\"profanity rules\\" (oh, the irony).<br /><br />Really, that's not love.<br />That's a really dangerous dependency.<br />Period.<br /><br />Nothing about that is romantic, loving or desirable.<br />I feel like I have to throw up when I think about young girls reading this s*** and ending the book with the feeling that a disgusting guy like Christian would be an ideal partner in their real life. And then go out and hook up with a @#$%% like that.<br /><br />5. The writing style.<br /><br />Unbearable.<br />If Mrs. James' intention was to make it sound juvenile she failed.<br /><br />On almost every one of the 608 pages the reader is confronted with overwhelming profanity. Sorry, but if I want to hear a jargon like that I drive to the next ghetto and get my fill. In a book this is highly inappropriate and misplaced.<br /><br />Also, someone should explain to Mrs. James what a \\"subconsciousness\\" really is. She must have misread it on Wikipedia. The special thing about a \\"subconsciousness\\" is, that it is subconscious you know? Means, you can't listen to it and *gasp* not even have a little chitchat with it.<br /><br />The \\"inner goddess\\" a.k.a Ana's vagina was annoying and ridiculous to no end.<br /><br />I was constantly bored with this book as it was a big bubble of nothingness. Nothing ever happened besides awkward sex and even more awkward, lame conversations.<br /><br />6. Bottom Line<br /><br />One of the worst books I ever read. Really.<br />I stay with it: Hyped trashy literature.as an unequal dependency by outsiders.

B005OCFGTO|4.0|Just like most of the other reviews noted.  This is a great price to get all 8 films but thats all you get.  No extra frills or collectables, just the movies for a good price.
B000AS4L16|5.0|I wanted to get my hands on a copy of Shoah when I saw that several reviewers had claimed it the best movie of 1985, and Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune had declared it the best movie of the 1980s.  Many reviews called it \\"an act of witness\\" as opposed to a traditional documentary, and it was clear that most viewed it as an important film.<br /><br />First let me say that this is not easy viewing.  Consisting of nothing but conversations and long pans across the fields that had previously been sites of death camps, Shoah is 9 hours of confessions, analysis and declarations of the strength of the human spirit in the face of terror and immeasurable pain.<br /><br />The stories of the survivors will tear your heart out, and at the same time leave you with chills at the horrors they had to face.  One segment, filmed in a barbershop, of a camp survivor who had been forced to cut the hair of victims prior to the gas chambers is particularly gripping.  This man, clearly as tough as they come, tells his tale in a matter of fact manner, even describing how he had to cut the hair of friends just before their death, knowing what was coming for them but unable to save them.  But when the interviewer asked him \\"how did that make you feel\\", the moment of introspection at the questions made it impossible for him to hide the incredible pain this put him through.  Never have I felt so terrible for anyone in any film I have ever seen.  And many of the conversations with survivors have the same pain.<br /><br />The filmmaker is clearly and excellent interrogator as well.  In his interviews with former Nazis that worked in the camps, he is consistently able to identify the parts of their stories that didn't make sense and in a completely innocent way, bring them back on topic with virtual full confessions of their duplicity and knowledge of every aspect of what was happening to the Jews.  This is not the crux of the film, but each of these cases is very telling in understanding themadness of the Third Reich.<br /><br />Some of the most interesting, and frightening, conversations were with German citizens.  Many of these people were caused great pain and suffering because of the camps, but there are also several who seemed to have no pity at all.  Telling stories of how they would terrify incoming death camp inmates by drawing their thumb across their throat whenever they were in view, you are left with the feeling that it was done for their enjoyment.  In the final series, a village of German citizens seem terribly happy to see a camp survivor they had all known for singing on the river during the war.  After much back slapping, the interviewer is able to lead them down a path where many seem to suggest that the camps were God's vengeance on the Jews for not believing in Christ.  Four decades after the war, and the anti-semitism is still very present despite their attempts to cover it up.<br /><br />Overall this is an important film.  Understanding the errors of humanity's past is the best way to educate people to prevent the same things from occurring again.  That doesn't make this film easy to watch.  More than once it brought me to tears, and connected me with the Holocaust in a way I never had been before.  I had always known of the horrors and the suffering, but in a clinical sense.  Shoah makes it all real.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|My son recommend this book.  I was not sure if I would like it because it did not sound like my kind of book but it was an excellent book. I could not put it down. I just started book 2. I highly recommed this book.
B001N4Q4MA|3.0|way over the head of my 5 year old. disappointed with the pacing which went way too fast and the film wasn't clever or fun. would not recommend.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|When you start this book you think man this kids life is messed up but as you read the rest you laugh and smile and become lost in what happens to him and how it realities to you. The first night I had this book I couldn't sleep at all.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This CD helped me lose those last 10 lbs noone can ever seem to get off.  I started out doing this just rid of my muffin top, but it helped to tone my arms and stomach as well.  I did this religiously 4 times a week and didn't even make it past level 1 - it is tough!  Was thrilled with this workout - it worked well for me.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|love this game ..so fun to get the animals! the graphics are cool too! you should play it. you will be addicted too.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|This case felt super cheap and completely prevented proper usage of the touchscreen. I returned it immediately and wished I had not bought in to liking the way it looked!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son and daughter in law who live about 3,000 miles away.  I presented it to them with the caveat that when they were finished with it, they were to send it back so we could watch it.  Will be getting subsequent seasons as they become available.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I don't know why, but I am addicted to this game.  It's very challenging but fun.  Makes me think about what would happen in a real-life scenario.  Got to pay attention to the news for clues. Each level of &#34;plague&#34; has different way of playing out, so you got to strategize every move.
B008AU7F3C|5.0|My opinion might be bias, considering I have Bat for Lashes two previous cds, but this one takes the cake.  On her last two albums there were some songs I just didn't care for and would constantly skip over, trying to get to the good parts.  Two Suns, came close to being perfect with so many hits like Siren Song, Daniel, and Pearl's Dream. This new album, The Haunted Man has reached that perfection for me. On The Haunted Man, I can play this album all the way through and just enjoy myself.  I was expecting to just like Laura and All Your Gold and just own this cd for my collection, but it turns out the rest are just as great.<br /><br />This is a great addition to any music lover's collection and perfect for Bat for Lashes fans.  I would even give this as a gift to someone who has never has heard of her music, because they're sure to become a fast fan.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you read The Hunger Games and Catching Fire, this is a MUST READ!  I found it more exciting than the first book, and the first book was pretty darn good... if you ask me. This one is a little more intense and the grand finale of a great story.  By now, if you haven't already, you're in love with the charatcers and rooting for them to concour the Capital.  As usual, an unexpected twist at the end and finally a long-awaiting conclusion to Katniss' love life.  I really hope they continue to make movies based on this trilogy.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I've been an avid fan of Garbage since I was a little kid and was probably one of the few kids in my elementary shcool that loved singing along to Only Happy When it Rains.  Grant it, something might be wrong with me then, but through Garbage's evolution, the band has strayed from its roots in Garbage and Version 2.0.  Bleed like Me was like the band was trying to get back to what it was before, but it just didn't have the grittiness I remember Garbage containing.<br /><br />Not Your Kind of People is like taking a step back in time for me.  I just skip back on some songs like Man on a Wire and The One to listen to a different instrument each time.  You have no idea how long this cd has been kept in my car since I bought it, but I keep it handy for my morining commutes to work and blar it on the way home.<br /><br />For old Garbage fans I hope this awakens an angst and energy that Garbage has always maintained in my head for years and now I have it again in a cd.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't read this book... UNLESS you plan to read the whole trilogy.  Ok, well.. you can, but its only the tip of the iceburg. Also, if you've seen the movie, let me say you're missing half the story... THE BOOK IS SO MUCH BETTER!  I was hooked from the very beginning.  An amazing story that takes place in the future with likable characters that you can fall in love with. It's a great read for young adults but enjoyed by all ages. For me, it was difficult to keep up with all the different districts, but don't let that keep you from enjoying a great story.  Just read the Catching Fire book, and it will help fill in the blanks later on.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Well written, but didn't like the ending, he should have left her. She was a psycho. Her parents created a monster.<br />Not sure it's worth the read.
B0061S073A|5.0|I used up my 1 month Kindle Free Time, so I searched for something similar but FREE (of course).  Kids Place, let me control what apps, books, music and other contact allowed to be accessed by my kids. Parents have a passcode in order for your kid(s) to do anything other than what you choose.  If they try to go home or click on something to exit the app, it gives them an error message and/or the option to enter a password. You can make the icons as big or small as you wish.  You can even change the background pic to one of theirs or upload one of your own.  Not too bad for a free parental control app for the kindle fire.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Could not put this book down. There is a different twist at every turn. I felt like the ending didn't match the rest of the book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you read the first book &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; this is a must read.  It explains what happens to Katniss and Peeta after they return back home to their District.  It goes into more details about each of the other districts and an amazing twist at the end. I really hope they plan on making another Hunger Games movie that echos &#34;Catching Fire&#34; book 2.
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Overall, I loved the first two movies, and this one just seemed to lack that POP of the second movie. I know the series is over, but it left room for more movies to come
B008COPZ60|5.0|My daughter loves it. My daughter loves anything by Justin Bieber. A great gift for Justin Bieber fans of all ages.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This is okay. It's really helpful too. I always check it to see how my battery is doing. I would definitely recommend other people download this app. A must have. I don't know what I would do without it in my life. I hope this is 20 characters so I can be fine with this review.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Season five was very well done; last few episodes had streaming issues but love the content enough to tolerate this
B009LDXQGW|5.0|The product was exceptionally new, and the packaging was clean and professional. I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it!
B008MEM24S|3.0|Unable to purchase the additional challenges and such.  I love this game, wish I could get the rest of it...
0756405890|4.0|Unique, like most fantasy.  Rothfuss writes a good story.  It's written through one perspective during two different points in time (save for one chapter).  If you're looking for a plethora of POVs, you could very well fall short, though there are a good number of people encountered along the way..<br /><br />On the downside, unless Rothfuss ties in future books with previous ones in a unique way, which he didn't with book two, there won't be much value in reading this one more than the one time.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved this book! Good story, hard to put down. Would have finished it sooner but work tends to get in the way!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Yes, there's sex, violence and cussing in hefty amounts (JUPITER'S ####!!), along with some homosexual elements.  But in the end, the story is good, the art style is great and Andy Whitfield was incredible.  If it wasn't for his cancer he would've likely had an outstanding career.  Also the extras are worth watching.<br /><br />The biggest downside is the slow motion being mixed in too much in the fight scenes.<br /><br />Bottom line, if gratuitous sex and violence is likely to turn you off to watching something, then leave this alone.  Otherwise, it was an outstanding season (though more entertaining than the type of sleep inducing drama that wins awards).
1250006341|5.0|The costumes, the history, the how-did-they-do-thats.  If you are a fan, an Anglophile, or someone who wants to know what all the fuss is about, buy this book.
0756404738|4.0|Good stories, with an interesting main character.  The only downside is if you have a good memory there's very little value in reading it a second time.  For that reason and that reason alone, I gave it 4 stars.  Though I am still looking forward to book three.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Wow. A feast for the senses. To watch them all, one right after the other was such a treat.  This edition has great extras.
B008JDAC7G|5.0|great game. super fun. I play it all the time. works great on my kindle fire. no problems or bugs
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Fun and addicting game, hard to believe its free. Many hours wasted playing this game. Must have for your kindle fire.
3836532441|5.0|I use this book as a reference resourse when I don't have a physical model. I find it invaluable, it hasn't failed me yet.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Fun game! Very addicting! Internet is a must and you can play with friends and family. Spend a lot of time playing it and love to see what dragon I will hatch next.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I liked this book because it has funny things about Greg and the family and Greg was the hero ha ha
B0016BP0PW|5.0|There have been a few movies made as tribute to great bands. This one gives a decent, while splendidly abstract story line to the music of The Beatles. Good stuff.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I loved this book so much! If you are not in the mood for a tear jerker I warn you! But it is a must read
B003YHSE7W|5.0|In my 23 years, I have found that RDJ rarely disappoints. He is the perfect lovable yet despicable character. Also plays a good Sherlock Holmes.
B000063JZQ|3.0|A little dated - 60s effects and music - but still powerful and true to the play.  Old lady nudity is sufficiently appalling.
B004J64QSI|5.0|A friend made me watch the 25th anniversary edition in College. I thought I was going to want to die, seeing as Nick Jonas played Marius. But it was awesome!
B00122Z7NK|5.0|One of my all time favourites.<br /><br />I listen to it every now and then, and it is always a pleasure.
